After discovering her remarkable endurance she began her athletic career as a pedestrian in 1879, travelling from one pedestrian venue to the next to earn money by walking. She would walk 100 miles in under 27 hours, usually indoors in an opera house or music hall. She then transitioned into bike races when, in 1881, she raced against a horse in Rochester, New York. In the same year she rode 1000 miles in one 6 day long event in Pittsburgh. In 1882, von Blumen was known as the women's cycling champion. She raced Louise Armaindo in July 1882 in Philadelphia; Armaindo won, taking over the women's championship title. In 1886, she won a race against two men who were competing together relay style.

It serves as a sequel to 2014's Annabelle and 2017's Annabelle: Creation, and as the seventh installment in the Conjuring Universe franchise. The film stars Mckenna Grace, Madison Iseman, and Katie Sarife, along with Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson, who reprise their roles as Lorraine and Ed Warren. In early April 2018, Warner Bros. Pictures announced that a then- untitled film in the Conjuring Universe franchise would be released on July 3, 2019. Later that month, it was announced that the film would be another installment in the Annabelle series, with Dauberman signed on to write and direct the film in his directorial debut, based on a story treatment written by Dauberman and Wan. Principal photography commenced by mid-October and officially wrapped in December 2018 in Los Angeles. Annabelle Comes Home was theatrically released in the United States on June 26, 2019, by Warner Bros. Pictures and New Line Cinema. It grossed over $231million worldwide and received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the film for its atmosphere, performances, and musical score, but criticized the plot and scares compared to its predecessors.  Plot  Demonologists Ed and Lorraine Warren confiscate the Annabelle doll from nurses Debbie and Camilla, who claim that the doll often performed violent activities in their apartment. During the drive back home, the doll summons spirits to attack Ed, but he narrowly survives. Annabelle is locked in a sacred glass case in the couple's artifacts room that is blessed by Father Gordon to ensure the evil is contained. Sometime later, the Warrens welcome Mary Ellen, who will be in charge of babysitting their daughter, Judy, at the house while they travel overnight to investigate another case. At school, Judy notices the spirit of a priest that begins following her. Mary Ellen's friend Daniela arrives uninvited to the Warrens' home, who is secretly curious about speaking to the dead. She sneaks into the artifacts room and starts examining them, ultimately trying to contact her late father. She abruptly leaves Annabelle's glass case unlocked, and the terror begins shortly afterward with the spirit of Annabelle \\"Bee\\" Mullins unleashed. That night, Annabelle begins releasing other spirits, such as the Ferryman, the Bride, a Feeley Meeley board game, and the Black Shuck. Mary Ellen's crush Bob Palmeri arrives outside and serenades her, but is later attacked by the Black Shuck and hides in the Warrens' backyard. Mary Ellen is tormented by the Ferryman, while Judy is confronted by Annabelle in her bedroom. Daniela had left earlier but sneaks back to return the artifacts room's keys. She gets locked inside the room and tormented by various objects, such as a piano and an old television that can predict the near future. She finds the Mourner's Bracelet and sees her father twisted into a malevolent spirit. A bloody and screaming Daniela appears on the television screen after having answered a cursed telephone. The real Daniela later unwittingly reaches to answer the telephone but is interrupted by Judy and Mary Ellen. Judy explains that they must lock Annabelle in her case again so the other spirits will rest. Bob protects Judy from the Black Shuck as she retrieves Mary Ellen's asthma inhaler, while Daniela is attacked and possessed by the Bride. Eventually, Mary Ellen and Judy find the doll when the priest's spirit, acting as Judy's guardian, guides them to the Ferryman. They manage to retrieve the glass case's key after they are attacked by demonic hands from the Feeley Meeley board game, and a possessed Daniela, but struggle to secure the case as the demon of the doll physically attacks them. Daniela recovers when Judy plays Ed's recorded footage of the Bride's exorcism, and helps put the doll back in the case. After the case is locked, the disturbances cease as the spirits return to their slumber, and Bob reunites with the trio. Ed and Lorraine return the next morning, and the girls approach them to recount the eventful night. Daniela apologizes to Lorraine, who gives her a comforting message from her father. Later, many friends gather to celebrate Judy's birthday party.  Cast  Production  The prop Annabelle doll In early April 2018, Warner Bros. announced that a then-untitled film in the Conjuring Universe franchise would be released on July 3, 2019. Later that month, it was announced that the film would be another installment in the Annabelle series, with Gary Dauberman signed on to write and direct the film in his directorial debut, based on a story treatment written by Dauberman and James Wan. Wan and Peter Safran co-produced the project. During the 2018 San Diego Comic-Con, Wan and Safran revealed the film's events would take place after Annabelle and would focus on the doll after she had been placed in a glass case in the Warrens' museum. Dauberman later confirmed this, stating that the film would take place shortly after the beginning of The Conjuring where the titular character is introduced, but also before many of the events of the first installment. On September 5, 2018, Michael Burgess was hired as the film's cinematographer. In late September 2018, Mckenna Grace was cast in the film as Judy Warren, the Warrens' 10-year-old daughter, and Madison Iseman as one of Judy's teenage babysitters. By October, Katie Sarife had joined the cast. That same month, it was announced Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga would reprise their roles as Ed and Lorraine Warren. Principal photography commenced by mid- October in Los Angeles. On December 7, Wilson announced that he had finished filming his scenes. A week later, filming officially wrapped. In February 2019, Joseph Bishara‚Äîwho composed the scores for The Conjuring, Annabelle, The Conjuring 2, and The Curse of La Llorona‚Äîwas revealed to be returning to score Annabelle Comes Home.

It has been conducted since the 1800s, and continues into the present day. The term \\"brumby\\" was first recorded in the 1870s. Reasons for brumby shooting include, but are not limited to: demands for grazing land and water for domestic herds, sport, to maintain pastoral stations, to reduce environmental damage caused by the horses, to control disease, and to prevent possible road collisions. Brumby shooting became a boom industry from the 1870s to the mid-1890s. It was reflected in the poetry and literature of the time, and also became a popular sporting pastime. It has been speculated that there are over one million feral horses in Australia.400,000 in 2006 (Dawson, op. cit. page 1) increasing at 8%/year to 2018 Background Horses were first imported into Australia in 1788 for agricultural and utility work. By 1800, about 200 horses are thought to have been imported.Dobbie, W. R., Berman, D. M., & Braysher, M. L. (1993) \\"Managing vertebrate pests: Feral horses.\\" Canberra: Australia Government Publishing Service Only the strongest horses survived the long sea journey, making for a healthy and strong stock which flourished.McKnight, T. (1976) \\"Friendly vermin ‚Äì Survey of feral livestock in Australia.\\" Berkeley: University of California Press From 1820 to 1860, the horse population in Australia increased a hundredfold from 3,969 to 431,525,Kennedy, Malcolm J. (1986) PhD thesis, \\"The Role and Significance of Bullocks and Horses in the Development of Eastern Australia 1788 to 1900\\",vol II, appendix H p. 158 which was an increase of about 12.5% per year. It is not known when the first wild mobs (groups of brumbies) appeared but, once established, feral horses would have increased at a similar or greater rate with numbers further boosted by escapees and rejected horses released into the bush. In 1840, it was reported that there were many horses running wild throughout the Botany colony. In 1843, it was noted that wild horses and cattle were becoming pests in New South Wales (NSW). In 1844, Ludwig Leichhardt, a German naturalist who explored northern and central Australia, reported seeing horses on the Dawson River, which was several hundred miles from the nearest station (public grazing land leased to a homestead). In 1850, The Perth Gazette and Independent Journal of Politics and News described the feral horses as \\"A _nuisance_ of no slight present importance to the breeders of horses, and which will probably hereafter prove to be a serious drawback, unless some measure is taken for its abatement.\\" In response to this, the measure advocated was the culling of brumbies. Some of these wild horses were captured and auctioned at the horse bazaars, but did not sell easily. In 1854, the Sydney Morning Herald reported that, \\"the sale- yards are full of miserable animals [...] Good horses always sell well; unbroken stock and scrubbers are of no use whatever\\". By this time there were wild horses in every district in the colony. In 1854 in New England, it was reported that there were thousands of wild horses abundant in the bush. In 1860, 100,000 wild horses in NSW was regarded as an underestimate. According to The Age, a daily newspaper in Melbourne, herds of cattle and troops of wild horses emptied all the shallow water-holes between the Darling River and Lachlan River; an activity which was also reported in the neighbouring mountain regions and in the Upper Shoalhaven. In 1864, the Bendigo Advertiser reported that hundreds of brumbies were seen on the back blocks of the Karamba run on the Murray River, as well as from Loxton to Swan Reach. The buildup of the wild horse population was unwelcome. A letter printed in the Bathurst Free Press and Mining Journal described the wild horses as being of \\"worthless character\\" and a cause for a drop in the prices of reared horses and a depletion in available grassing land. Options considered for the abundant wild horse population included to be \\"boiled down and converted into glue, tallow, leather, salt-beef, and other substances of exportable value.\\" Social problems were also linked to the feral horses. An 1870 report of the Chief Inspector of Stock for NSW said that the running of wild horses had served as a youth initiation into cattle raiding (called duffing). The economic temptation was felt to be corrupting to the currency lads in outlying areas.  Legalisation  The NSW Impounding Act was approved on 20 June 1865, and gave authority for landholders and squatters to destroy unbranded horses or cattle on their land. Previously, the only legal recourse was to drive unwanted stock to the nearest public pound. Debate on the bill in the NSW Parliament as recorded in the Sydney Morning Herald shows that parliament needed no convincing for this measure. John Robertson, then the Secretary for Lands, called the wild horses \\"a perfect nuisance\\" to the landowners, and it was noted that their shooting would increase productive use of the land, provide employment, and sustain itself through the sale of meat for pig feed. Economic pressures In 1866, the Sydney Morning Herald reported that wild cattle and horses had left most runs valueless, and that men always carried a rifle to kill any such animal encountered. It stated that the efforts at taming the horses were wasted as they were undependable. = Pig feed = In 1868, the Manaro Mercury investigated the claim that feral horses were only useful for feeding pigs, and found it to be \\"the prevailing opinion in this district\\". The story described this as a regular practise for the feral horses sold at government pounds. A similar story appeared in The Sydney Morning Herald in 1871. In 1921, Mr J. Jardine, son of Monaro pioneer William Jardine, recalled that \\"the country was run over by wild horses, which were sold to feed pigs at 12 for a shilling.\\" = Horse breeding = During this time, there was a good market in India for NSW horses, called Walers from 1846. The bulk of the shipment to India were thoroughbred horses from the best studs. Some inferior horses were shipped to India and threatened the high regard held for Walers. The established horse traders would certainly have been opposed to the export of brumbies, which would have damaged the reputation of Australia's stock. Public discourse by horse breeders in the 1860s called for a tax on brood mares to raise funds for \\"encouragement of improved breeding\\" and the destruction of brumbies. Alexander Bruce, the NSW Chief Inspector of Stock, wrote that Australia's horse stock had become a \\"mongrel race\\" affected by cross- breeding.  Shooters  Newspaper reports of the 1870s described the difficult lives of professional brumbie shooters: carrying out unpleasant work from dawn to dusk, with no comforts and inadequate pay. It was a \\"newborn calling\\", and the slaughter required an adjustment of values, to reduce what had been considered a noble animal to its base price of hide and hair. The \\"murderous and nasty work\\", as described by one shooter, had to be balanced with the good brought to the generation of squatters who might otherwise be ruined. The brumby shooters were soon busy across the country in a \\"war of extermination\\". Over a generation, Brumby hunting became a popular pastime of the period, and young men from towns would gather in pairs and troops to hunt brumbies on Sundays and holidays. The slaughter was a full industry in 1895, bringing 6 shillings a hide, and employing numerous professional hunters. Hunts, along with increased settlement, had reduced the brumby problem in the early twentieth century. However, they were never eradicated and populations would rebound and repeatedly grew to the point that organized shooting was felt necessary. Women as principals and with their husbands joined the shooters. Demand for horses had gone up by the mid-1930s and some brumbies were captured and brought in for sale. The best animals were kept for draft and pack horses, the unhealthy or inbred horses were killed, and those remaining were sold. Brumbies continued to be reported as a problem in the early 1950s, and though brumby shooting was revived as a pastime there was a lack of experienced men and suitable ammunition for an extensive cull. Increased prices for horsehair and hides were hoped to attract hunters, and government aid was sought. In 1947, pastoralist E. A. Brooks advocated use of airplanes to kill brumbies with strafing fire, as the practice of ambushing them at water sources was inadequate to their eradication. A few years later, aerial marksmen in helicopters were employed in coordinated control programs to pursue and destroy entire mobs of brumbies.Dawson, M.J., Lane, C. and Saunders, G. (Eds) (2006). Proceedings of the National Feral Horse Management Workshop ‚Äì Canberra, August 2006. page 14 In the 1960s, cattlemen in the high country grazing areas conducted intensive culling, halving the number of brumbies in some areas. In the 21st century, brumbies, along with feral donkeys, pigs and buffalo, were routinely shot from helicopters in organized culls in the Northern Territory and Western Australia.theguardian.com Notable hunts and shooters *In the first half of 1871, 1,527 brumbies were reported shot on the east side of the Bogan River, with similar numbers expected as the hunt moved to the west side. *Alexander Ryrie, owner of Micelago Run in Monaro, killed about 1,400 brumbies in two-and-a-half years. *Under contract to the Australian Agricultural Company, Edward Corbett and William Ellis shot 1,500 brumbies on the Gloucester run in 1872‚Äì1873. *The Green brothers collected 25,000 horse hides over a few years from the mountainous country around Oberon, Shooter's Hill, and Porter's Retreat. *Many thousands a year were killed on a run of the Dawson River. *Over 8,000 were trapped and shot in a summer season at Eurombah in the 1890s. *Ben Supple was a well-known hunter credited for exterminating the extensive number of brumbies at Walra station on the Macleay River. *In the mid-1890s, J. Nixon led a party that shot nearly 3,500 brumbies over eighteen months at Rawbelle station and Culcralgie station. *The Brisbane Courier reported on 15 May 1924 that brumbies had become a severe pest in the Cape York Peninsula, and that Mr. Massey and his son had killed 964 brumbies. Massey stated that there were \\"easily a couple of thousand more running wild\\". *In 1927, the Western Star And Roma Advertiser reported that a shooter on Alexander Downs had killed 2,000 brumbies in a season at one shilling each. *In 1930, a \\"brumby menace\\" was reported by the Queensland Times. *Some of the brumbies were reported to be the offspring of animals set free when the Beerburrum Soldier Settlement was abandoned. The government responded by amending the Diseases in Stock Act to provide for the destruction of the animals, with brumby shooting limited to four months a year and to districts determined by the ministry.Diseases in Stock Act Amendment Act of 1930 Proclamations named the Bowen, Maryborough and Townsville, Roma, Toowoomba and Rockhampton stock districts, and newspapers reported \\"open season\\" on brumbies. Additional hunts were authorized through the mid-1930s. *By the mid-1940s, brumbies were again considered a serious problem threatening big stock rearing. At Clifton Hill Station, 4,000‚Äì5,000 brumbies had been shot without diminishing their impact. In 18 months, 8,000 brumbies had been shot along the Cooper River. *In 1949, the eastern suburbs of Sydney were invaded by brumbies, which damaged gardens and fences. Acting on a petition by residents of Diamond Bay, Alderman K. B. Armstrong advocated that the police shoot the animals, as they had no stockade to hold them. Contemporary issues= Road safety = Motor vehicle collisions involving horses have been occurring in Australia since the 1920s. A study of crashes in the 1990s found that over 5 years, 24 fatalities involved \\"stock\\" (which may include horses) and 13 involved a \\"horse/large animal\\".Attewell, R., & Glase, K. (2000). Bull bars and road trauma. Report CR200. Australian Transport Safety Bureau: Canberra. Feral horses were shot after two fatalities occurred within 2 to 3 kilometers of each other on the Bruce Highway near the Clement State Forest north of Townsville in 2015. The coroner's report noted that a cull of feral horses was approved in 2006‚Äì07, but was abandoned after protests from animal-rights groups. Attempts to relocate animals were constrained by costs and threats. Following the deaths, aerial culls and ground shooting removed 203 horses from the forest. The average cost of each road fatality to the Australian economy was over $4 million. = Disease = The 2007 Australian equine influenza outbreak demonstrated that exotic diseases pose a serious threat to Australia's horse industry. Outbreaks of equine pneumonitis and equine metritis occurred in 1977 despite Australia's isolation and strict quarantine measures. Diseases in the feral population could threaten the country's horse industry, estimated to bring $6.3 billion to in 2001.Gordon, Jenny (2001) The Horse Industry - Contributing to the Australian economy, RIRDC Publication No 01/083 Feral horses can also harbour disease threats to beef and dairy cattle. Wild horses were shot as part of the campaign in NSW to eradicate cattle tick, the most serious external parasite of Australian cattle.Biosecurity Australia (2010) Import risk analysis report for horses from approved countries: final report. Biosecurity Australia, Canberra. page 12 NSW was declared free of cattle ticks. Horses can also carry brucellosisAnimal Health Australia (2005). Disease strategy: Bovine brucellosis (version 3.0). Australian Veterinary Emergency Plan (AUSVETPLAN), Edition 3, Primary Industries Ministerial Council, Canberra, ACT. and thousands were mustered in the far north in the 1980s under the Brucellosis- Tuberculosis eradication program.Dawson, op. cit. page 13. Brumbies which could not be mustered were shot from helicopters. The international community accepted that the disease was eradicated in 1989.More, SJ., Radunz, B., Glanville, RJ.(2015) Lessons learned during the successful eradication of bovine tuberculosis from Australia Veterinary Record 177, 224-232. = Conservation = Feral horses have a considerable impact on their environment, affecting vegetation, water sources, soil, and compete with native species for resources.Dawson, op. cit. page 7. Early pastoralists noted this damage, cutting grass close and leaving the soil vulnerable to erosion, while compacting the soil to hinder water retention. This could permanently damage the grassland and heath habitats.Dyring, 1990, p. 122 =Cultural impact= Feral horses damaged Indigenous heritage sites in Carnarvon National Park, by licking artwork and raising dust.Weaver, 2007 Control of feral horses in national parks has been compromised by politics. An overview of the history is summarised in Proceedings of the National Feral Horse Management Workshop ‚Äì Canberra, August 2006'Dawson, op. cit.  Opposition  Whether the brumby should be considered a cultural icon or a pest is debated. Some regard it as a pest, like the rabbit, which has seen various eradication campaigns. The heritage value claim of brumbies has undergone testing. Conformation data and genetic markers from 36 horses ‚Äì 16 selected horses from the Guy Fawkes River National Park (GFRNP) brumbies and 20 horses classified as Walers ‚Äì were sampled and assessed by scientists from Sydney and Kentucky. It was concluded that neither group were \\"genetically unique\\" and that they were the product of continual introduction of outside horses. An investigation into the brumbies in Barmah National Park found that they had mainly originated from horses released by a local breeder after 1952 and that there was no significant long- term population of wild horses in the park area prior to this date, thus debunking claims as to their genetic and historical significance. In culture In 1877, newspapers gave an account of a brumby hunt that could have been the inspiration for the poem The Man from Snowy River. It described J. R. Battye, who took part in a hunt while on holidays. His party located a mob of brumbies, and as they gave chase the bridle came off Battye's horse; with no control, he spurred the horse which followed the brumbies over ground thickly timbered and full of holes and came up with them, bringing Battye into shooting range. In 1875, The Queenslander published a poem about the life of the brumby shooter. Along with the excitement, it describes a life of hardship, yet the shooter remains compassionate for the animals while carrying out his \\"murderous trade\\" and dreams of the beauties who might be fashioned in horse hair.

A member of the Democrats (DEM), he is currently a Federal Deputy from Rio Grande do Sul in his fourth term. After the 2018 Brazilian general election, president-elect Jair Bolsonaro invited Lorenzoni to be Chief of Staff. He was also designated leader of the transition team. Biography Lorenzoni was elected State Deputy of Rio Grande do Sul in 1994 for the Liberal Party (PL) (merged with Party of the Republic in 2006). In 2003, now in the Liberal Front Party (PFL), he was elected Federal Deputy, being one of the strongest opponents of the government of president Lu√≠s In√°cio Lula da Silva and the Workers' Party (PT). During his terms in the Chamber of Deputies, Lorenzoni was a member of the Mixed Inquiry Parliamentary Committee (CPMI), investigating Correios, Cachoeira (illegal gambling entrepreneur Carlinhos Cachoeira), and Petrobras. On 2016, Lorenzoni voted for the impeachment of then president Dilma Rousseff (PT). During the government of Michel Temer (MDB), Lorenzoni supported the Constitutional Amendment n¬∫.95 (New Tax Regime) and Labor Reform. On August and September 2017, the Deputy voted against the reports that rejected two complaints made by the then Prosecutor General Rodrigo Janot against president Temer. In 14 March 2017, Prosecutor General Rodrigo Janot sent to the Supreme Federal Court 83 inquiries based in pleas made by 78 executives of Odebrecht, being mentioned in Odebrecht testimonies. In June 2018, Supreme Court Justice Luiz Fux rejected the inquiry: \\"The steps taken were not enough to elucidate the materiality of the alleged crime\\". To the RBS TV, Lorenzoni assumed the irregularity, claiming that he \\"couldn't\\" declare the money to the Electoral Justice, and that the cipher would be less than the R$200,000 cited by Ricardo Saud. Lorenzoni is a member of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Brazil. Positions=Anti-corruption measures= In 2016, Lorenzoni was part of the committee that turned the ten anti-corruption measures proposed by the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office into law. During the process of discussion, four versions of the report were presented. The first report Lorenzoni presented on 9 November criminalised \\"caixa 2\\" and proposed integrity tests for public agents with solely administrative consequences, while the original text had proposed criminal and civil lawsuits. The second report, presented on 21 November, typified the crime of \\"caixa 2\\", with sentences of two to five years for people who use non-declared resources in electoral campaigns. These changes were seen as a way for politicians who used \\"caixa 2\\" before the change in law to seek amnesty, although the report had not proposed the amnesty directly. Also, vote selling was typified as crime. This version had 17 measures. Lorenzoni's third report on 22 November decreased the number of measures from 17 to 12, removing those that mentioned popular lawsuits and international cooperation pleas. The fourth report, with 20 changes from the previous one, was presented on 23 November. Among the changes there were: raising the minimum amount required for active and passive corruption to be considered a major crime from 100 to 10,000 minimum wage equivalents (about R$8.8 million); removal of the time to set up investigations and finish denounces; prosecuting those who practice it in the name of a candidate (in addition to the candidates themselves, their political parties and donors). The Committee unanimously approved this version the same day, with 30 votes in favour. =Prison in second instance= In October 2016, Lorenzoni supported the decision of the Supreme Federal Court of allowing the prison of defendants convicted in second instance, and said the will include it among the anti- corruptions measures. \\"What are we gonna do? We're gonna bring this decision of the Supreme Federal Court and put in the final report. In other words, from now on, there is a decision of the Supreme Court and in a few months there will be, in the Brazilian Code of Penal Procedure, the same decision confirmed in a law by the Brazilian parliament\\", he said. =\\"Caixa 2\\" amnesty= In November 2016, Lorenzoni opposed \\"caixa 2\\" amnesty, along with Deputies Fernando Francischini (SD-PR), Alessandro Molon (REDE-RJ), Vanderlei Macris (PSDB-SP), Carlos Sampaio (PSDB-SP), Joaquim Passarinho (PSD-PA), and Senators Alvaro Dias (PV-PR) and Ana Am√©lia Lemos (PP-RS), listening to the claims of the civil society that signed for the approval of the 10 Anti-corruption Measures, and of the Public Prosecutor's Office, author of the bill. =Legal immunity= In November 2016, in an interview in the Brazilian TV show Roda Viva, Deputy Lorenzoni reaffirmed his opposition to legal immunity. \\"There is, in the country, a feeling of impunity. I hope the Congress take this moment to make a conciliation with the streets. The parliamentaries need to have capacity and humility to listen to the voice of the streets\\".

In June 1918, Aldrin went to the School of Aeronautical Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he was awarded an M.S. degree in aeronautical engineering in 1918, writing his thesis on an \\"Investigation of behavior of electrically heated wires with varying inclination to wind stream as applied to anemometer development\\" and the \\"Relationship of telephone transmitter resistance with diaphragm displacement - particularly to ascertain applicability as indicator for internal combustion engines\\", under the supervision of Arthur E. Kennelly. Between the wars Aldrin completed flight training in February 1919, and was transferred to the United States Army Air Service on 1 July 1920. He was assistant commandant of the Army's first test pilot school at McCook Field, Ohio, from 1919 to 1922. On 22 March 1924, he married Marion G. Moon, whom he had met in the Philippines while serving as aide-de-camp to Billy Mitchell. He knew Orville Wright and Jimmy Doolittle was an occasional visitor to his house. He earned a Sc.D. in aeronautical engineering from MIT in 1928, writing a thesis on \\"Dynamical analysis of the spinning of airplanes\\" under the supervision of William G. Brown. Now a captain, Aldrin resigned his commission in the Air Corps on 12 November 1928. On 15 February 1929, he became a major in the United States Army Air Corps Reserve. He briefly became a stockbroker, but sold all his stocks in August 1929, just two months before the Wall Street Crash of 1929 in order to buy a grand three-storey, seven bedroom house in Montclair, New Jersey. He became an executive at Standard Oil, where he contributed to books and papers on aerodynamics, metallurgy, airplane structures and aviation fuels. He was a passenger on the first transatlantic round trip of the dirigible Hindenburg. He resigned from Standard Oil in 1938, and became an independent aviation consultant. As an Army reservist, he served in the Air Corps Procurement Planning Office in New York City and at Fort Ethan Allen, Vermont, from September 1930 to August 1939. World War II On 4 February 1942, with World War II raging, Aldrin was recalled to active duty as the Commanding Officer of Newark Airport, New Jersey. He then became the commander of the Sea Search Attack Section of the Eighth Air Force in England in May 1942. In October he moved to Washington, D.C. as the Civilian Technical Service officer. In January 1943 he became the Sea Search Attack Unit Liaison Officer with Headquarters United States Army Air Forces, a position he retained until July 1944, when he went to Wright Field, Ohio, as a Design and Development Officer with the 4020th Army Air Force Base Unit. He served there as a project engineer on experimental production aircraft until January 1945, and then as Chief of the Operational Aids Branch with the 4020th Army Air Force Base Unit until November 1945. Later life Grave at Arlington National Cemetery Aldrin left active duty on 21 June 1946, but remained a reservist until he retired from the Air Force Reserve with the rank of colonel on 1 May 1956. He later became a consultant to the manned space flight safety director of NASA. Aldrin died in San Francisco, California, on 28 December 1974, while he was visiting his daughter there, and was buried at Arlington National Cemetery. He was survived by his sister, two daughters, and son, Buzz Aldrin. His wife Marion suffered from depression and committed suicide in 1968. He is commemorated by the Edwin E. Aldrin Sr. Award, which is presented to an Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT) graduate who displays leadership and accomplished AFIT's educational objectives in an outstanding manner.

Mabalon was born in Stockton, and earned her doctoral degree from Stanford University; she later taught at San Francisco State University. Mabalon was the co-founder of The Little Manila Foundation, which worked to preserve Little Manila in Stockton, California. During her life, her work elevated the topic of the history of Filipino Americans, in Central California in particular. Early life and education Mabalon was born on August 17, 1972, in Stockton, California to Filipinos who had immigrated to the United States from the Philippines; her father was a guerrilla during the Japanese occupation of the Philippines. Mabalon's grandfather, Pablo \\"Ambo\\" Mabalon, ran the Lafayette Lunch Counter, an important hub in the community and one of the longest surviving Filipino American businesses in Little Manilla. Many Filipinos frequented the restaurant, including Carlos Bulosan. It remained in business until 1983, and the building it had occupied was torn down in 1999. Mabalon's maternal grandmother, Concepcion Moreno Bohulano, was the first school teacher of Filipina descent in the United States. Mabalon was also the niece of Fred and Dorthy Cordova; who were involved in the founding of the Filipino American National Historical Society. During high school, Mabalon was involved in extracurricular activities, including leading her high school's Asian Club, student council, and editor of Hi-Lite. In 1991, Malabon was involved in a January issue of Sassy, being described as a \\"editor-in-chief\\". Graduating from Edison High School, her post-secondary education involved attending San Joaquin Delta College, University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), and earning her doctorate at Stanford University. Mabalon's master's thesis was titled \\"Filipina Pioneers: The Pinay in Stockton, California, 1929‚Äì1946\\", and was written at UCLA in 1997. Mabalon's doctoral dissertation was titled Life in Little Manila Filipinas/os in Stockton, California, 1917‚Äì1972, and published in 2003. During her time at UCLA, Mabalon was active in the Filipino community on campus. She endorsed the effort to keep Tagalog as an available language taught at the university. Career In 1999, Mabalon and Dillon Delvo co-founded The Little Manila Foundation in order to preserve what remained of the Little Manila neighborhood of Stockton, California. In 2004, Mabalon became a faculty member at San Francisco State University; she was an associate professor of history. She focused her work on the history of Filipino Americans, Filipinos in Stockton, and Filipinos role in the 20th century labor movement. In particular, she highlighted the often overlooked efforts of Filipino Americans in the 20th Century farm labor movement, which has been seen as primarily a Mexican American movement lead by Cesar Chavez. Mabalon was also on the board of trustees of the Filipino American National Historical Society. In 2010, photographs taken by Mabalon were published on SFGate about a Filipino American band Skyflakes. In 2015, Mabalon was interviewed about the November 2015 Paris attacks by Voice of America, as she and her husband were visiting the area at the time. In 2017, Mabalon, along with Gayla Romansanta, wrote a children's book about Larry Itliong; the book was published a year later. In 2018, Mabalon visited the Delano campus of Bakersfield College, which is in the area where the Delano grape strike began, for an event about archiving; at the event she spoke to encourage Filipino Americans to preserve their family histories, with the goal of expanding historical narratives. Honors and awards In 2013, the Filipino Women's Network listed her among their \\"100 Most Influential Filipinas in the World\\". In 2014, she received an honorable mention for the Frederick Jackson Turner Award for her book Little Manila Is in the Heart; that same year Mabalon was profiled in the book Remarkable Women of Stockton. Death In August 2018, Mabalon died while snorkeling off of Kauai. She had been vacationing with her family prior to her death. Mabalon had an asthma attack when she was out with her sister, and her inhaler did not alleviate her symptoms. She was brought out of the water and 9-1-1 was called. Paramedics attempted CPR and then transported her to an emergency room. She died at the hospital. Mabalon was buried at San Joaquin Catholic Cemetery. Mabalon was survived by her husband of ten years, Jesus Perez Gonzalez. In early October, Mabalon was memorialized at San Francisco State University. Legacy Mabalon's work of documenting the history of Filipino Americans continued at the Little Manila Center that she had co-founded even after her death . Mabalon authored three books and was working on a fourth. Her works elevated the status of Little Manila in Stockton and helped lead to Little Manila being listed as one of America's Most Endangered Places. The San Francisco Chronicle described Mabalon as \\"a major figure to California's Filipino Americans\\".

It was built in 1887. It operated as the Port Jackson Hotel until being delicensed in 1923, after which time a new Port Jackson Hotel was built further along George Street. In 1933, it became the Russell Private Hotel, providing accommodation from the upper floors. The ground floor has been leased for various uses since the original delicensing, initially as a cafe for several decades and most recently as a restaurant and bar. The property is owned by Property NSW, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002.  History  In the area of The Russell Hotel was the convict's hospital, opened in 1788 under the care of surgeon John White. The hospital cared for the hundreds of sick convicts; five hundred alone arriving with the Second Fleet. From 1790 a portable hospital building, shipped out from England with the Second Fleet, was used. The colony's sole hospital continued to be located in this area until the \\"Rum\\" hospital situated on Macquarie Street was completed in 1816. The vacant land was set aside as a government quarry to extract the sandstone to build Governor Macquarie's Sydney. The site of the quarry is shown in a plan of Sydney dated August 1822. This particular part of the hospital site was classified in the general surveys of the town undertaken in the early 1830s, to formalise land boundaries and entitlements, as Lot 7 of City Section 84 which comprised an area of 1 rood 15 perches. =Ownership by Samuel Terry and family= In January 1841 this allotment was officially granted to the trustees, executrix and executors of the estate of the emancipist Samuel Terry, these being Rosetta Terry (widow), John Terry Hughes (nephew and son-in-law), Tom White Melville Winder of Windermere, Maitland (family friend and long-standing business acquaintance) and James Norton (solicitor). Samuel Terry's interest in this town allotment however seems to date from at least around 1823 when an area of \\"26 rods\\" situated on the \\"west side George Street\\" with a description which approximates that of the George Street half of Lot 7 of City Section 84 was leased to Terry for the term of 21 years. Terry (1776? - 1838), publican, merchant and landowner has been described as the \\"Botany Bay Rothschild\\". He arrived in Sydney in 1801 convicted of theft with a sentence of seven years' transportation. By the time of the expiration of his sentence he was established as a merchant in Parramatta, and in 1809 was the owner of a farm on the Hawkesbury River. In 1810 he moved to Sydney and opened a public house in Pitt Street and married Rosetta Marsh, a woman of considerable business acumen. During Governor Macquarie's administration the Terrys' business interests prospered to where \\"he held more than a fifth of the total value of mortgages registered in the colony.\\" At the time of his death in 1838 he left a personal estate of , an annual rental income from his Sydney properties of and \\"land property which defies assessment.\\" Terry's business interests included brewing and he was also occasionally a publican. In regard to the site of the Russell Hotel, Terry undertook the construction of a terrace of three buildings (today's 139-143 George Street) on the George Street half of the allotment. This was evidently completed in the mid to late 1820s for it is plotted on Hoddle, Larmer and Mitchell's \\"Map of Town of Sydney\\" of 1831. The footprint of this building, in a terrace of three with a breakfront, is clearly defined in Robert Russell's later survey of 1834, while the few available images of the building suggest a substantial structure of three storeys with the prominent breakfront capped by a closed pediment. Located on the corner of George Street, in . The building may have been part of the neighbouring premises (present day address of 139-141 George Street) as the Robert Russell survey implies or alternatively the premises may have been used, perhaps intermittently, as a public hotel, given Terry's brewing interests. From the mid 1840s tenants of the premises are listed in street directories and council rate assessments; the first entry is for the year 1845 when a Henry Day traded from premises with a street address of no. 661 Lower George Street, but from June 1845 the premises were a licensed public house leased by Isaac Moore and known as the Patent Slip Tavern. G. M. Dow in her biography of Samuel Terry mentions that an earlier name for the Patent Slip was the Sheer Hulk for which there is no licensed publican's record. The trading sign Patent Slip evidently refers to the longstanding government dock sited to the north of the Commissariat Store and demonstrates an affiliation with the maritime activities of the port. The tavern was one of a considerable number trading in Sydney's portside areas of The Rocks and neighbouring Millers Point over the nineteenth century. Isaac Moore, perhaps was all too aware of the potential business benefits derived from the discovery of gold, for in July 1851 he entered into a lease with Rosetta Terry of \\"no. 661 (George Street) used as a Public House known by the sign of the Patent Slip\\" for a period of five years at an annual rental of . This lease was renewed in February 1856 (with a commencement date of 5 August 1856) for a further period of five years at an increased annual rental of , reflecting the marked increase in property values experienced in the early years of the gold rush. During this latter phase Moore ceased to manage the hotel, preferring to sublet to William McMillan (-1858) and later John Gallagher (1859-1868). Moore later kept the Customs House Hotel at the corner of Argyle and Harrington Streets, while his family are reputed to have owned the Clontarf picnic grounds at Middle Harbour. The site of the Russell Hotel was held by Samuel Terry's widow and principal trustee, Rosetta, until her death in 1858. For a short period after this her real property was controlled by Mrs Rebecca Fox until June 1860 when the estate was partitioned. The beneficiaries of this part of the estate were Henry Hill Osborne, Patrick Hill Osborne, Alick Osborne, and Benjamin Marshall Osborne all of Marshall Mount in the Illawarra. Shortly after this, in June 1861, the property was purchased by William Reilly for . Reilly retained ownership until 1880. Reilly continued to licence the tavern, but also rebuilt the terrace of residential properties fronting Globe Street situated to the rear of the hotel. In the rebuilding, which appears to have been undertaken between 1863 and 1865, Reilly demolished a terrace of single storey weatherboard houses (which seem to have been constructed in the early 1830s) and replaced them with a double storey terrace of three stone built houses. It is highly probable that these houses were designed by architect David McBeath and constructed from September 1864. The impetus for the rebuilding was probably the emerging market for rental properties in the city for the working classes employed in the local industrial and shipping businesses. The tavern continued to be managed by John Gallagher until his death in 1868 and then by his widow, Margaret, in 1869. Over the 1870s the licensee was Martin Heany (1870-1877) and then John Hoskins (). =Acquisition by Thomas Brennan= In August 1880, the property was purchased by Thomas Brennan (d. 1894), initially of Oberon, and later of Summer Hill, Sydney for . Brennan built the extant hotel in 1887 (dated by keystone on building), but initially continued to lease the old premises under an arrangement he entered into in April 1882 with George Henry Levett and Norman John Croker, general agents, to the following publicans: * 1880Samuel Davis or John Hosking or Dane * James Morgan * 1882 - 1885John M. Jacobson * 1886 - 1887Henry Deeble In March 1887, Brennan mortgaged the property, possibly to finance the construction of the extant hotel; and in November of the same year he entered into a lease agreement with Henry Burrows and Hampton Carroll Gleeson for the presumably recently completed hotel which then became known as the Port Jackson Hotel. Unfortunately research has failed to identify the architect. The hotel was completed in time for the centenary of European settlement in Australia. Burrows and Gleeson were the owners of the former Waverley Brewery near present day Bondi Junction. The brewery had opened in 1874 as the Adelaide Brewery. Shortly after the completion of the new Port Jackson Hotel (The Russell Hotel), in 1888 Burrows and Gleeson entered into partnership with Allt & Co., wine and spirit merchants, and the Surrey Brewery in Waterloo to form Allt's Brewery & Wine & Spirit Co. Ltd. Each partner agreed not to be connected with any other brewery or wine and spirit business in Sydney or elsewhere for a period of ten years. The brewing operations of the Surrey Brewery were closed and brewing was concentrated at the Waverley Brewery. Unfortunately, the optimism of the 1880s vanished with the onset of the depression of the 1890s and with it the fortunes of Allt's Brewery & Wine & Spirit Co. Ltd., which went into liquidation in 1895. In this context, it is probable the Port Jackson Hotel was an outlet for the Waverley Brewery and Allt's wines and spirits. Prior to the collapse of the holding company the Port Jackson Hotel was managed on behalf of the company by the following publicans: * 1887-1889Harry Deeble * 1890John Walker * 1891William Selff * 1892Charles Prince * 1893W. L. Howarth * 1894Patrick Lancer * 1895George Craig * 1896W. Russell The owner of the hotel, Brennan died at his home, Cattai Villa, Old Canterbury, Road, Summer Hill in June 1894. In the following October, Alfred James Powell, postal officer of Goulburn, and Thomas Read, solicitor of Sydney, acquired the property title. Their ownership was relatively short lived, and may, therefore, have been bequeathed the property by Brennan, for in May 1896 the property was sold to Tooth & Co. Ltd. In September 1896, Tooth & Co. entered into a long term lease of the hotel with Michael Norris. Norris and his associates continued to manage the hotel until 1911. =Resumption by the NSW Government= The bubonic plague broke out in Sydney in January 1900. Government authorities had done little to stem the potential for outbreak, but the general panic of the early part of 1900 prompted effective and expensive responses in the form of cleansing, rat catching, enforced quarantine and ultimately resumption of private property including all of The Rocks area. The Rocks was initially under the administration of The Rocks Resumption Board aside from the foreshore areas and later the Sydney Harbour Trust and its successor the Maritime Services Board (MSB) through to the 1970s. The history of the Russell Hotel (Port Jackson) for the early decades of the twentieth century is representative of the broader changes taking place in The Rocks with the commercial licensed operation continuing until 1923 under Tooth & Co.'s lease from the government (head leases were taken out in October 1900, February 1914 and November 1918) and managed by the following publicans: * 1912-1916Mark Lapin * 1917-1921Mrs Josephine Dunn * 1922Edward Claire * 1923William D. Cordingley The attached residences fronting Globe Street however were demolished probably around 1902 at which time rate assessments for the dwellings ceased and the area was rated as part of 143 George Street, although the extant building in this area was constructed 1913. This work was overseen by the architect for the Housing Board, William H. Foggitt. The major change came in the 1920s when the license of the Port Jackson Hotel was withdrawn by the Licenses Reduction Board around 1923. This Board was established under the Liquor (Amendment) Act of 1919 (effective from January 1920) with the role of reducing the number of publicans' licenses in New South Wales, determining which premises should be delicensed, and assessing the amount of compensation payable. The establishment of the Board reflects broad community support for the temperance movement in the early decades of the last century. Another consequence was the implementation of early closing at 6p.m. which been had been introduced as a temporary measure in 1916. Tooth & Co. was awarded compensation for revocation of the license and the publican received . A new Port Jackson Hotel was subsequently built by Tooth & Co. further south on George Street. Delicensing and subsequent use The premises of the delicensed Port Jackson Hotel were converted to a cafe; type use by 1927 operated a commercial lease from the Sydney Harbour Trust. In the early years of the cafe's operation, the lease changed hands regularly until 1932 when Emmanuel Sarandidis took on the business trading as the Colonial Caf√©. Prior to this, the cafe would seem to have traded as Whitworth's Cafe. In the post Second World War era the cafe traded as the Singapore Cafe (1947/50) and Allen's Cafe (1970). From 1933 the upper floors of the building have been used to provide hotel accommodation. Trading as the Russell Private Hotel, the address of these premises was 143A George Street. The origin of the name, Russell, has not been determined and it may only be coincidental that the last licensed publican of the Port Jackson prior to its acquisition by Tooths Ltd in 1896 was W. Russell. The use of the upper floors as a private hotel has continued to the present. In 1981 the lease was transferred to the Russell Hotel Pty. Ltd with Victoria Alexander as its Designer and Director. Alexander undertook an extensive refurbishment of the premises and reopened as Sydney's first boutique small hotel. The company sold its interest to a consortium in 1985. The intention of this consortium (Russell Hotel Pty. Ltd.) from the outset was to combine the operations of the Russell Hotel and the Fortune of War Hotel. This was achieved in 1987. The ground floor (former cafe) section of the property was tenanted through the 1980s by the Japanese Bookshop, and (from 1985) a Japanese delicatessen at the rear on the corner of Globe Street and Nurses Walk. This lease expired in 1991. After this time the ground floor was reconverted back to a cafe type use, initially operated by the proprietors of The Russell Hotel and traded as the Russell Tea Room, and then, from 1992, under sub-lease by Boulders Pty. Ltd. The ground floor was operating as the Acacia Restaurant in 2009. In 2018, the ground floor operates as a bar and restaurant, The Push, while the private hotel continues to provide accommodation.  Description  The building is situated on a corner and built on exposed rock face sandstone footings. The remainder of the external walls are rendered masonry, with decorative string courses and other mouldings. The building is a strong corner element in the streetscape with a distinct and picturesque conical roof to the curved corner form. Timber doors and windows (double hung) appear original, but may include some recreated elements, and are in good condition. The chimney is a secondary corner feature, with decorative features, and set back slightly from the corner. Internally, the building retains original layout, and features including joinery, leadlight, floor boards, timber ceilings, and timber stair leading to upper level. The upper levels appear to be the original hotel room layout, with intact associated features including joinery, doors and fireplace.  Heritage listing  The Russell Hotel is of state heritage significance for its aesthetic, historical and scientific cultural values. It is a unique example of a late nineteenth century Queen Anne style licensed hotel quaintly set within the historic harbourside area of Sydney that embodies the key characteristics of its architectural style owing to the integrity of the exterior and interior which retain significant original features and much of the original layout. The building and site demonstrate longevity of European use that is historically associated with the early colonial development in Sydney in being part of the general hospital site ( 1790- 1810s) and part of a stone terrace of three constructed for Samuel Terry (s). The subsequent continuous use of the site as a public house/hotel is closely associated with the later economic and social development of The Rocks area. The building is included on key heritage registers maintained by government and community groups and these recognise the heritage values of the item individually and as part of the historic Rocks precinct. Its contemporary hotel use is likely to be recognised by visitors and locals alike owing to its prominent location in a well-frequented tourist destination and characteristic \\"heritage\\" presentation inclusive of the picturesque tower that is a local landmark and boldly marks the corner of George and Globe Streets and the entry into the George Street commercial and now principally tourist orientated strip of The Rocks.

He is the current director of the Palaeontological Research and Education Centre, Mahasarakham University. He is best known for his work on vertebrate palaeontology in northeastern Thailand, having contributed to the discovery of many fossil taxa and dig sites in the Khorat Plateau, as a part of a long-standing collaboration between Thai and French scientists.  Biography  Mahasarakham University, Isan Varavudh Suteethorn was born in the Nakhon Pathom Province of central Thailand on October 10, 1948. He obtained a bachelor's degree in geology from the Chiang Mai University in 1967, and started working at the Geological Survey Division of the Department of Mineral Resources (DMR) in 1974 as he began his career in geology. While working for the DMR, Suteethorn gained expertise on Thailand's northeastern Isan region, located in the Khorat Plateau. His geological mapping of those areas led to the discovery of various new fossil sites, which have since yielded the majority of Thailand's palaeontological discoveries. Vertebrate palaeontology came into prominence in Thailand in 1980, when Thai geologists from the DMR cooperated with French scientists to begin expeditions in the Khorat Plateau. Suteethorn, one of the first members of the dinosaur expedition team, learned how to preparare and conserve fossils in France and Canada and in 1986 was granted a Certificate of Vertebrate Palaeontology by the University of Paris VI, France. The same year, the spinosaurid dinosaur species Siamosaurus suteethorni was named in honour of his palaeontological efforts in Thailand, by the French palaeontologist √âric Buffetaut and his Thai colleague Rucha Ingavat.Buffetaut, E.; and Ingevat, R. (1986). Unusual theropod dinosaur teeth from the Upper Jurassic of Phu Wiang, northeastern Thailand. Rev. Paleobiol. 5: 217-220. Suteethorn has been head of the Thai dinosaur research team since 1992 and continues to find new dig sites, which are subject to cataloguing and routine checks from his team, although excavation has not begun in many of them. In 2006 Suteethorn was given the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology's Skinner Award. In 2018, he received the Explorer Award from the National Geographic Society, during their annual Explorer's Festival. He is currently lecturer and director of the Palaeontological Research and Education Centre of Mahasarakham University.  Taxa named by Suteethorn alone or with co-authors  Suteethorn has helped name and describe (often in cooperation with Buffetaut) many fossil vertebrates from the Khorat Plateau, including extinct dinosaurs, fish, crocodylomorphs, mammals, and turtles. His team from the Mahasarakham University discovered various fossil mammals in a Chaiyaphum cave, including teeth from pandas, hyenas, and the extinct orangutan Khoratpithecus piriyai. = Dinosaurs = pelvic bones and caudal vertebrae of Siamotyrannus isanensis Map of the Khorat Plateau in northeast Thailand and the various geological formations it is composed of *Siamotyrannus isanensis, in 1996 interpreted as the earliest known tyrannosaurid, before being reclassified in 2012 as a metriacanthosaurid. *Phuwiangosaurus sirindhornae * A possible new Psittacosaurus species, P. sattayaraki. *Isanosaurus attavipachi, the earliest known sauropod dinosaur. *Kinnareemimus khonkaenensis'' *Siamodon nimngami = Fish = *Lepidotes buddhabutrensis *Acrorhizodus khoratensis * Two species of Isanodus, I. nongbualamphuensis and I. paladeji. * Two species of Isanichthys, I. palustris and I. lertboosi *Lonchidion khoratensis *Siamamia naga *Ferganoceratodus martini *Mukdahanodus trisivakulii *Acrodus kalasinensis *Thaiichthys = Crocodylomorphs = *Khoratosuchus jintasakuliLauprasert, K.; Cuny, G.; Thirakhupt, K. and Suteethorn, V. 2009.

The piece was well received and ran for more than 200 performances. It was subsequently staged in London, New York, Berlin and Vienna, but has not gained a permanent place in the operatic repertoire.

Beppo and his wife are uneasy about the furtive behaviour of three of their guests, but the three are not political conspirators as Beppo and B√©atrix imagine. They are the dashing young San Carlo, his bride-to-be, and her father. They are keeping as low a profile as possible to avoid the attentions of the local potentate, Rodolpho, Podest√† of Bergamo. San Carlo was once Rodolpho's favourite, until he and the Podest√†'s wife were caught in flagrante. Rodolpho did not exact revenge at the time, but warned San Carlo that he would repay him in kind, and cuckold him on his wedding day. Since then he has kept San Carlo at his court, under constant surveillance. San Carlo has now excused himself from attendance under the pretext of illness, and is about to marry Graziella, the daughter of Casteld√©moli, a rich landowner. As witness he has recruited his trusted friend Montefiasco. As the newlyweds are leaving the chapel the Podest√† arrives, to enquire about San Carlo's health. To avoid the threatened revenge, San Carlo introduces Graziella as Montefiasco's wife, a ploy that threatens to backfire as the formidable Lucr√©zia, Montefiasco's real wife, has also turned up. Rodolpho is much taken with Graziella, and commands that she, her father and her supposed husband, Montefiasco, accompany him to his court. Lucrezia, furious, is left behind. Alphonsine as Lucr√©zia ;Act II: The Park of the Podest√†'s Palace in Bergamo. Casteld√©moli has been made Rodolpho's Chamberlain, Montefiasco, captain of the pages and Graziella, reader to the Podest√†. San Carlo is looking for a way out of this difficult situation. Lucrezia arrives in a rage, but Montefiasco calms her down, explaining more or less what is going on. She is sufficiently mollified to fall into his arms. Rodolpho, observing this, reasons that if Graziella's (supposed) husband can tangle with another woman, Rodolpho would not be acting unreasonably in seeking to seduce Graziella. He confides his plan to San Carlo, who can see no way of saving Graziella other than for the two of them to flee together. Their attempt to do is thwarted, and Rodolpho learns that San Carlo is married to Graziella and Montefiasco to Lucrezia. ;Act III: A vestibule of the Palace. Rodolpho has had San Carlo confined to his quarters. Alone with Graziella he has his threatened revenge in mind, but is won over by her sweetness and abandons his attempts to woo her. They agree that if she and her father give him a little property on their estate that he has long coveted, Rodolpho will release everyone and consider the matter closed, particularly as it emerges that his late wife had strayed with several others as well as San Carlo. He allows himself a small vengeance by allowing the agonised San Carlo to suppose briefly that his release has been bought at the price of Graziella's honour, but everything is eventually explained and all is well.

The work has rarely been staged since, although there was a brief revival at the Odeon Theatre, Marseille in 2002. The piece was presented (in French) in London in 1876, and again in 1888. An English adaptation by Harry Greenbank was staged there in 1897 under the title The Scarlet Feather, with additional numbers by Lionel Monckton. A French production was given in New York in 1877.

Biography Chil was educated at home by his father before attending the Conciliary Seminary of Las Palmas, from which he graduated in 1847. Initially intending to study for the priesthood, he decided to study medicine in Paris, for which he received financial assistance from his uncle, the parochial vicar of the church of San Juan Bautista in Telde. From 1848, he studied in Paris, gaining a Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery and completing his doctorate in 1857. During this time, he acquired an interest in anthropology. After a brief period at the University of Cadiz, he returned to Gran Canaria and set up practice in Las Palmas. During this time he would frequently travel to attend anthropological conferences. He dedicated considerable time to the scientific and historical investigation of the first settlers of the Canary Islands. He read all he could by the ancient historians and chroniclers, and gathered as many objects and remains as he could: mummies, skulls, bones, ceramics, textiles and other objects. These would become part of the Museo Canario collection. More than fifteen years of research resulted in the publication of Estudios hist√≥ricos, climatol√≥gicos y patol√≥gicos de las islas Canarias. It was initially published in 1876, and was well received in the Canary Islands. However, on 30 April 1876 the Bishop of the Diocese of the Canary Islands, Jos√© Mar√≠a Urquinaona y Bidot initiated proceedings for excommunication, due to his agreement with the Society of Anthropology of Paris that defended the theories of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck and Charles Darwin on human origins. In 1879 a group of intellectuals led by Dr. Gregorio Chil y Naranjo founded the Museo Canario, which was initially based on the third floor of the Las Palmas City Hall. The museum was Chil's most important contribution to the Canary Islands. He retained his ties to this institution all his life, and devoted most of his work to it, occupying the position of director of the institution while his health permitted it. Gregorio Chil y Naranjo died of heart disease at the age of 70 on 4 July 1901. In his will he declared that, upon the death of his wife, Rosenda Su√°rez Tasc√≥n, the house in which both had resided in the street of the Colegio de Las Palmas would become the headquarters of the Museo Canario.

The building was listed as a Category 2 Historic Place List No: 3911 with Heritage New Zealand in September 1984.  History  In 1907, the need for a post office was raised by the residents of Matakohe to Member of Parliament for Kaipara,John Stallworthy, who made representation to the Postmaster-General on their behalf. In July of the same year, Stallworthy received a reply stating if the settlers were willing to provide a suitable site of 'not less than 40 ft frontage, and 80 ft depth' then provision of a post office could be considered. By November 1907 initial funding of ¬£600 for the future Matakohe Post and Telegraph Office was included in the Public Works Estimates votes for public institutions and buildings. Tenders were called for in March 1908 and finalised in May with the firm of Radcliffe and Burton awarded the contract at a tender price of ¬£749. Construction began in June its completion date is undetermined by 1909, however the post office was providing services.

Their water is extremely salty and alkaline and their colour changes depending on the angle of the sun impacting the clear waters.

Despite their name and appearance, they are not remnants of the sea. Water temperatures of have been measured. The turquoise colour is due to sunlight reflected from the floor of the waterbodies. The Ojos de Mar are one of the main tourist attractions of Tolar Grande and are of scientific interest due to the stromatoliths that grow there; stromatoliths are the oldest traces of life on the planet and at least 3.4 billion years ago helped give rise to the oxygen in the atmosphere; this 2009 discovery of stromatoliths at Ojos de Mar has gained media attention and in 2011 it led to the Ojos de Mar along with Laguna Socompa where similar stromatoliths occur to be declared a protected area by the government of the Salta Province. They lie at elevations of from the town of Tolar Grande ( west from the city of Salta; the Tren a las Nubes tourist train passes through Tolar Grande) in the Salta Province of Argentina, and can be reached from Tolar Grande through a road and a parking lot. The environment of the waterbodies is fragile and thus visitors are discouraged from approaching too closely, also because the ground is unstable. Other tourist attractions of Tolar Grande are the volcanoes Llullaillaco and Socompa and the Cono de Arita. Vegetation in the area includes tola and yareta; animals reported from there include vicu√±as.  Biotechnological significance  The Ojos de Mar display a rich assembly of microorganisms including extremophiles in their waters which have been analyzed with bioinformatics methods. In general, the Argentine Puna in South America features a number of high altitude lakes between elevation which are characterized by extreme environmental conditions: Extremely high insolation by the sun, low temperatures, large temperature changes between day and night, extremely high salinity of their waters owing to high evaporation rates and accumulation of toxic elements such as arsenic. Because of this, plants and animals are rare in these areas and extremophile microorganisms which can tolerate the extreme conditions make up much of the biota. These in turn could be used to obtain enzymes that could be useful for industrial processes, such as ultraviolet radiation-resistant or -exploiting enzymes like photolyases and antioxidants that protect cells from oxidative damage; these compounds and proteins could be used in medicine and the cosmetic industry.

The flowers were admired by Franz Joseph, who visited the exhibition. The landscaping of the park started in 1929 by landscapers √Årp√°d M√ºhle, Wilhelm M√ºhle's son, and Mihai Demetrovici, the leader of the horticulture service in that period. The park was designed in English style, with alleys, canopy, and circular areas of roses. During the interwar period, the park was called Rosarium and there were over 1200 classified varieties of roses. Also, in this period the open air theater was built up.Stefan Both. √Årp√°d M√ºhle, proiectantul Parcului Rozelor din Timi»ôoara, la loc de cinste alƒÉturi de tatƒÉl sƒÉu, adevarul.ro, 1 August 2014, access date 2016-08-11 In 1944 the park was destroyed by bomb.

In spring 1943, a wave of successes demonstrated the rise of the Greek Resistance to the Axis powers, particularly the Italians; large areas of the mountainous interior of the country were effectively liberated. In response, the Italian 11th Army planned a large-scale anti-partisan operation for June. Warned of Italian intentions, ELAS General Headquarters withdrew its dispersed detachments to the central Pindus massif. In Thessaly, the forces withdrawn from the Mount Pelion and Mount Kissavos areas, were detailed to watch the Porta and Mouzaki passes, covering the withdrawal of the rest of the Thessalian partisans. Contrary to orders from ELAS GHQ to only engage in disruptive hit-and-run attacks against the Italian army, the commanders of these two detachments, numbering around 250 men with mostly light weaponry and scarce ammunition, decided to hold the passes against the expected Italian attack. Over two weeks, field works were erected in front of the passes and outposts established in the villages. The Italians moved against the Greek positions on 8 June, with around 4,000 men, both infantry and cavalry, from the 24th Pinerolo Inf. Div., with artillery and aviation support. Facing far superior numbers and lacking sufficient ammunition, the partisans were able to hold back the Italians at Porta on the first day, but at Mouzaki, the Italians forced them back and occupied the village. After reinforcements were brought in during the night, the Italians managed to advance on both flanks on 9 June, threatening to encircle the partisan position at Porta. The ELAS partisans had to withdraw to the mountains but nevertheless scored a significant success: having suffered significant casualties, the Italians did not continue their advance, and broke off their planned anti-partisan sweeps in the mountainous interior. Background On 6 April 1941, following a botched Italian invasion in October 1940, Nazi Germany invaded Greece through Bulgaria and Yugoslavia. The Greek capital Athens fell on 27 April, and by June, after the capture of Crete, all of Greece was under Axis occupation. Most of the country was left to the Italian forces, while Bulgaria annexed northeastern Greece and German troops occupied the strategically most important areas. A collaborationist government was installed, but its legitimacy among the Greek people was minimal, and its control over the country compromised by the patchwork of different occupation regimes Greece was divided into. As early as the autumn 1941, the first stirrings of a resistance movement were registered, with attacks on isolated Gendarmerie stations in Macedonia in northern Greece. The establishment of large-scale resistance organizations in 1942, most notably the communist-dominated National Liberation Front (EAM) and its military wing, the Greek People's Liberation Army (ELAS) began to challenge not only the collaborationist government's organs, but also the Italian occupation troops. The winter and early spring of 1943 saw a series of resistance successes against the Italians in the mountainous areas of mainland Greece, with battlefield victories such as at Fardykambos, or the liberation of towns like Karditsa (12 March), Grevena (24 March), and Metsovo (22 April). By 16 April an Italian report noted that \\"control throughout the north-east, centre and south-west of Greece remains very precarious, not to say nonexistent\\". As a result, the high command of the Italian army in Greece, the 11th Army in Athens, decided to mount a large-scale and concerted anti-partisan effort, aimed at hemming in the partisan forces in the Pindus mountain massif, and then launching coordinated and concentric attacks in Thessaly, Central Greece, and Epirus to clear the area. The operation would begin after 20 May, the deadline set by the new collaborationist government under Ioannis Rallis for partisans to surrender in exchange for a full amnesty. Consequently the ELAS Central Committee issued orders to its regional headquarters to prepare for the attack, gathering the bulk of its forces in the Pindus massif, and relocating itself there, while leaving behind rear guards to obstruct the Italians. Central Committee member Kostas Karagiorgis informed the Thessaly Headquarters of ELAS of these decisions when it met at Porta on 17 May. Thus the partisan groups of western and eastern Thessaly‚Äîthe Agrafa sub-command (·ΩôœÄŒ±œÅœáŒ∑Œ≥ŒµŒØŒøŒΩ ·ºàŒ≥œÅŒ¨œÜœâŒΩ), the sub-command (·ΩôœÄŒ±œÅœáŒ∑Œ≥ŒµŒØŒøŒΩ ŒöœåŒ∂ŒπŒ±Œ∫Œ±), the Kissavos‚ÄìMavrovouni sub-command (·ΩôœÄŒ±œÅœáŒ∑Œ≥ŒµŒØŒøŒΩ ŒöŒπœÉœÉŒ¨Œ≤ŒøœÖ-ŒúŒ±œÖœÅŒøŒ≤ŒøœÖŒΩŒØŒøœÖ) and Pelion‚ÄìKarantaou sub-command (·ΩôœÄŒ±œÅœáŒ∑Œ≥ŒµŒØŒøŒΩ Œ†Œ∑ŒªŒØŒøœÖ-ŒöŒ±œÅŒ±ŒΩœÑŒ¨ŒøœÖ)‚Äîwere ordered to move towards the area of Mount Smolikas, while leaving behind some forces to harass the Italians, and occupying some strategic passes, i.e, the Porta‚ÄìMouzaki pass and the Kalambaka‚ÄìDiava pass. After the Italian operation began on 22 May, the eastern Thessalian forces‚Äîthe Kissavos and Pelion sub- commands‚Äîwere forced to cross the Thessalian plain in a three-day operation, moving only under cover of darkness. Battlefield and opposing forces The Portaikos river with the Ottoman-era footbridge The Porta Pass is formed by the river as it descends from the Pindos mountains to the Thessalian plain. The village of Porta lies exactly at the entrance of the pass. In the 1940s, a narrow car road leading from Trikala to Pertouli passed near the village, and crossed the river on a concrete bridge. The northern side of the pass, towards Koziakas, is nearly inaccessible except for narrow footpaths, but the southern side towards Agrafa is more easy to traverse. The rear of the Porta defensive position could be attacked via the car road passing through the gap at Mouzaki allowed easy access to the village of Vatsounia. As a result, any defender of the Porta Pass against an opponent coming from the plain was also obliged to keep the Mouzaki‚ÄìPorti area also under control to avoid being flanked. Dimitris Tasos (alias Mimis Boukouvalas), one of the ELAS commanders at Porta The defence of the pass was undertaken by the eastern Thessalian sub-commands of Pelion and Kissavos, which were closest to the area. The Koziakas sub- command was ordered to occupy the Kalambaka‚ÄìDiava pass, while a detachment sent to the Agrafa area for procuring supplies was ordered to remain there and carry out harassing attacks. The ELAS forces deployed in the Porta‚ÄìMouzaki numbered in total 235 partisans, aided by four groups of Reserve ELAS fighters from the villages of Dousikos, Porta, Beletsi, and Mouzaki, but only the Dousikos group actually fought in the battle, as the others were used as covering forces and messengers. The two detachments of the Kissavos sub- command, reinforced by a squad from the Agrafa sub-command‚Äî8 squads in total‚Äîheld the Porta straits, while the Pelion sub-command, likewise reinforced with a squad from Agrafa‚Äî6 squads in total‚Äîheld the passes at Mouzaki. Typical for Greek resistance fighters during this time, their weaponry was a medley of different origins: Greek Mannlicher-Sch√∂nauer rifles, old French Lebel and even more antiquated Gras rifles, as well as rifles of Bulgarian, German and British provenance. Each squad had one sub-machine gun and one light machine gun, again of different types, from the World War I-vintage French Chauchat used by the Greek army to captured Italian Breda 30s and British-supplied Brens. The only heavier armament were two Hotchkiss machine guns and an Italian mortar lacking aiming sights. One machine gun and the mortar were deployed at Porta, while the other machine gun at Mouzaki. The partisans also faced shortages in ammunition, with some fighters having as few as 15 bullets for their rifles. Likewise, only 36 shells were available for the mortar, of which six misfired and had to be repaired during the battle; the light machine guns only had about 300 bullets, sufficient for a brief firefight at most; one of the machine guns lacked any ammunition at all, so the partisans' arms workshop shortened 3,500 German bullets by to provide sufficient ammunition. The commanders at Porta, as well as of the overall force, were the Cavalry Captain Georgios Zarogiannis (nom de guerre \\"Kavallaris\\", 'horseman'), a veteran of the Greco-Italian War and head of the Kissavos sub-command, and Dimitris Tasos, better known by his alias of \\"Mimis Boukouvalas\\". During the course of the battle, a former General Staff colonel, Dimitrios Petroulakis, served in an advisory capacity; after the battle, despite being a committed royalist, he joined the ELAS General Headquarters as chief of staff. According to Boukouvalas' memoirs, given the small force at their disposal, the Thessaly Headquarters initially insisted that they only harass the Italians, but he and Zarogiannis insisted on standing and fighting at Porta as long as possible. To that end, a fortnight before the battle they began preparing extensive fieldworks covering a front of some , running from north of Dousikos to Mouzaki. Telephone lines were laid to outposts in Dousikos, Mouzaki, and to Tyrna and Pertouli to their rear. Advanced detachments and horse patrols were sent out to gather supplies and reconnoitre the plain as close to Trikala as possible, and a telephone line was laid to the villages of Mikri Pouliana and Beletsi to warn of the approach of Italian forces. Headquarters reluctantly conceded them freedom of action, and Boukouvalas and Zarogiannis continued preparing their defences in the area. Since no reinforcements could be expected in short time, plans were laid down to delay the Italian advance for as long as possible. The forces covering the Mouzaki area were instructed, if pressed hard, to begin an orderly retreat by pivoting towards the right, while keeping their left anchored to maintain contact with the Porta position. In early June 1943, the Italians held Trikala with a cavalry and an infantry regiment, with a couple of tanks, an artillery battalion, engineers and support services, with a further cavalry regiment at Simikli (modern Polyneri). The morale of the Italian forces was low, but its command was aware, from spies and reconnaissance flights, that ELAS had left some small forces in the Porta‚ÄìMouzaki area and had begun erecting fieldworks there. In preparation for the anti-partisan sweeps, reinforcements were brought up from Larissa, including men of the so-called \\"Roman Legion\\", a Vlach secessionist group sponsored by the Italians. Pack animals were requisitioned from the neighbouring settlements in preparation for an anti- partisan sweep. The forces amassed for the operation against Porta numbered two full infantry battalions from the Pinerolo Infantry Division, two battalions from the‚Äîpartly motorized‚ÄîLancieri di Aosta cavalry regiment at Trikala, a field battery, two companies of Vlach Legionaries, four bomber aircraft and one reconnaissance aircraft. The battle=8 June= Italian infantry marching The Italians' plans became apparent on the night of 7 June, when their force began moving by road from Trikala to the village of Gortzi on the road to Petra. At about 01:00 on 8 June, the telephone operator from Poliana informed ELAS command of the Italian movement, and the partisans were alerted to occupy their positions. The Italians arrived at Beletsi at 04:30. In order to increase the psychological impact on the partisans, the Italian commander placed his cavalry in front, advancing at the double. At 05:30, men of an advanced detachment from Pelion, situated on the heights above Beletsi, opened fire on the advancing Italians, before retiring higher up the mountain side. Shortly after, Italian cavalry and motorcycle troops made contact with the defensive position of the Kissavos men at Petra. As Italian infantry followed up their advance guards, fighting developed both at Petra and at Mouzaki. Both sides made use of their heavy equipment, while the Italian aircraft also began attacks. The Greeks' mortar proved inaccurate, both due to the lack of sights as well as from the lack of practice due to the sufficient ammunition available. On the Porta sector, the Italians withdrew around noon, leaving only a detachment of 40 men to watch the entrance in a guardpost outside Porta. Shortly after a group of five partisans led by \\"Peronosporos\\" ('mildew') managed to crawl up to them without being seen, surprise the garrison, and force them to withdraw completely. At about the same time, Lieutenant Georgios Nikitas took over the command of the partisan mortar and relocated it, greatly improving the accuracy and effect of its fire, which helped to scatter the Italian cavalry massing for an attack outside Beletsi in the afternoon. Repeated cavalry attacks between Porta and Dousikos were repelled by partisan fire before they came near the Greek positions. These were the last Italian attempts against Porta for that day. The Italians pressed their main attack in the direction of Mouzaki, and by noon had made some small progress. The commander of the Pelion sub-command, Thanasis Koufodimos (\\"Petros Pilioritis\\") was wounded by a mortar fragment at , followed by another partisan, Dervisis. Despite his wound, Koufodimos remained in his post directing the battle until his replacement, Ioannis Katsantonis, arrived in the afternoon. Around noon, the Italians occupied the village of Mouzaki, which they plundered and torched. To avoid being surrounded and outnumbered, the Pelion squads began withdrawing to the ridge between Beletsi and Mouzaki and the village of Porti. In the evening, the Italians broke off their advance and withdrew to Beletsi and Mouzaki. =9 June= ELAS partisans During the night, Italian vehicles brought up more troops, including the cavalry regiment at Simikli, and one infantry battalion each from Larissa and Volos, bringing the total force to 5,500 men, according to the testimony of Italian prisoners taken by the partisans. These reinforcements arrived during the morning. At the same time, the partisans faced a dire lack of ammunition, that had already manifested itself during the first day of the battle. According to Boukouvalas, messages were sent to the village of Prodromos, where the nearest ELAS force under the teacher Lepouchis was quartered. They requested he take his men to Lesiana, to the right and rear of the Italians, and attack them from there. However, Lepouchis put the proposal to a vote among his men, who rejected it and as most expected that the Porta position could not be held. The partisans did receive a reinforcement of 60 men from Pertouli during the night, who took position on the eastern flank of the Porta position. At dawn, the Italians renewed their assault with artillery and air support. Their attack was aimed not only to the south against Mouzaki as in the previous day, but also to the north against Mount Koziakas, in a pincer movement against the partisan positions. The first assault was thrown back, and Boukouvalas reports how the partisans could see the Italian commanding general landing in his liaison plane to bolster his men's morale. The Italians managed to reach Porti around noon, which they torched, but their subsequent attempts to push forward into the southern flank of the Petra position were repelled. The role of the Hotchkiss machine gun, emplaced outside Porti and manned by a certain \\"Flogas\\" ('flame'), proved crucial, as its fire pinned down the Italian troops for the rest of the day. On the northern flank, however, the Italians had more success: cavalry squadrons reconnoitred the approaches to Mount Koziakas, finding that the partisans held only the area up to the villages of Dousikos and Lepenitsa. In the afternoon, two battalions launched an attack on the northern flank of the Porta position, captured the villages of Gorgyri and Xylopariko, and pushed on the heights of Lepenitsa, from where the Italians and their Legionary auxiliaries could flank the ELAS forces at Dousikos, who were forced to withdraw higher up the mountain. After the squad defending the area ran out of ammunition, the Italians entered the village of Dousikos in the afternoon and set it on fire, threatening the defenders of Petra, who were also running low on ammunition; only 2‚Äì5 bullets per rifle remained, while the mortar had no more shells. At the same time, on the southern flank the Italians applied renewed pressure on the Sklataina‚ÄìVatsinia axis, threatening the Porta position with outflanking. As a result, the ELAS commanders ordered a withdrawal, which began at 17:00, in the direction of Tyrna. At 17:30, the road bridge over the Portaikos river was blown up to impede an Italian advance. The withdrawal was so quick that the Italians, busy torching the village of Porta, lost contact with the partisans. Once the Porta troops were safely withdrawn and a new defensive position established at Dramizi, the Mouzaki position was evacuated under cover of night. Aftermath According to EAM/ELAS members, the partisans, fighting for two days against a vastly superior force, suffered only three wounded, while the Italians had about 300 dead and wounded, including a major. The military commander of ELAS, Stefanos Sarafis, who was nearby at Tzourtza, claimed \\"almost 500\\" Italian dead and wounded, as well as the loss of many horses and an aircraft, although later in his memoirs he raised the number of Italian casualties to \\"approximately 700\\". The official numbers recorded by the Hellenic Army History Directorate, however, are only three Italian soldiers and 5 Legionaries killed. The following day, the Italians torched the villages of Porta, Vatsinia, Chania, and Ropotania. Estimating the partisan forces present at many times their actual number, they made no attempt to enter the mountainous regions, and after gathering their dead returned to Trikala two days later. Only eight days later did a 1,500 men from Trikala move against the Agrafa area, setting fire to the villages of Vounesi, Kanalia, and Mesenikolas. Near Vounesi they were confronted by some 30 partisans of the Agrafa sub-command. The partisans withdrew higher up the mountain after a first firefight but the Italians, suspicious of a larger ambush, broke off the operation and returned to their bases. For ELAS, the battle of Porta was of particular importance as the first time it confronted the Italians as a regular army in a \\"more or less full-scale defensive action\\", as Sarafis describes it, rather than hit-and-run ambushes. This marked the transformation and maturation of ELAS from a guerrilla force into \\"disciplined troops who knew how to fight\\", a fact readily recognized by the Italians themselves: the Italian commandant at Trikala remarked as much to the local Greek prefect, reprimanding him for not providing accurate information about the partisans. From then until the Italian armistice in September 1943, the Italian garrisons in Thessaly remained confined to the cities and gave up any further attempt at confronting the partisans. In the weeks after the armistice, the Italian forces in Thessaly began negotiating their going over to the partisans. Initially it was agreed that the Italian formations, the Pinerolo division and the Aosta cavalry regiment, would remain intact and retain their armament to fight against the Germans, but on 15 October the 1st ELAS Division forcibly disarmed them, encountering only brief resistance from the Aosta cavalry regiment and isolated garrisons in the area of Porta.

From 1968 to 1972, he was the music critic for The Guardian, a role that made him the first dedicated rock critic at a British daily newspaper. Having worked as the arts editor for New Society magazine, he became editor of the BBC publication Radio Times from 1969 to 1979. During that time, he also wrote on music and pop culture for The Listener, the Los Angeles Times, the Chicago Sun-Times, Creem, Rock et Folk, Melody Maker and Time Out. Since the early 1980s Cannon has worked in public health, mostly food and nutrition policy. He co-authored, with Hetty Einzig, the bestseller Dieting Makes You Fat in 1983, and with Caroline Walker the 1984 bestseller The Food Scandal: What's Wrong with the British Diet and How to Put It Right. Cannon's other books include The Politics of Food. He is a former director of science for the World Cancer Research Fund and now lives in Brazil where he is a member of the Centre for Epidemiological Studies in Nutrition and Health (NUPENS), University of S√£o Paulo, Brazil. Early years and education Cannon won a scholarship to Christ's Hospital public school in Horsham in the county of Sussex. He subsequently attended Oxford University, where he was a member of Balliol College. He recalls that hearing Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring played loudly on a family friend's state-of-the-art hi-fi, at the age of fourteen, first enlightened him to the power of music. As further key events, he cites playing \\"Why Do Fools Fall in Love\\" in a record- shop listening booth in Horsham, and a year later \\"when a van came down a street in Essen, Germany, playing the demo of 'Heartbreak Hotel'\\". Career=United Kingdom Popular culture, music journalism = New Society, The Guardian  Cannon's first published writings on popular culture appeared in 1962 in New Society, where he was a founder-member of the editorial staff. He worked in-house for the magazine, later becoming its design, art, production, and arts editor. From 1967, he began writing on popular culture for, and redesigned, The Listener, under the editorship of Karl Miller, and in 1968 began writing a weekly column on pop and rock music for The Guardian. Along with Tony Palmer of The Observer, a Sunday newspaper, he was one of the leading figures in the emergence of British rock criticism during the late 1960s. George Melly, who became The Observers first pop culture commentator in 1965, described the pair as seeking to \\"establish a critical apparatus\\" with which to evaluate contemporary popular music. Helped by his association with The Guardian, Cannon was able to contribute more substantial articles to the Los Angeles Times and the Chicago Sun-Times, and to underground magazines such as Creem. He wrote the 1970 documentary film London Rock, focusing on the UK's counterculture movement. He recalls that, together with Rolling Stone journalists David Dalton and Jonathan Cott, he joined Granada Television documentary-makers such as Jo Durden-Smith, John Sheppard and Michael Darlow in devising \\"prime-time networked shows designed as anthems of the revolution\\". Among these late-1960s projects, he says that the Johnny Cash at San Quentin TV special was his idea, and he \\"share[s] credit\\" for the ideas behind the concert films The Doors Are Open and The Stones in the Park. He also directed the film of Frank Zappa's performance at the 1970 Palermo Pop Festival, for RAI, Italy's national public broadcaster. In July 1971, he was one of four speakers on \\"Youth and Music\\" at the inaugural International Music Industry Conference hosted by Billboard magazine. In his address, he discussed rock music's inspirational role on the lifestyle of contemporary youth and also its ability to provide \\"the catalyst for styles of death\\", with regard to the counterculture-related deaths of Sharon Tate in Los Angeles, Meredith Hunter at Altamont, and Weather Underground radical Diana Oughton. Cannon says he was frustrated by The Guardians habit of cutting down his submissions and stopped writing for the paper in 1972. In addition, he cites his lack of interest in contemporary musical trends ‚Äì a perspective that was reflected in his being awarded \\"Pseud of the Year\\" by the satirical magazine Private Eye for two consecutive years. Later in the 1970s, he wrote what he considers some of his \\"best pieces\\" for Melody Maker and Time Out, when they were edited by Richard Williams.. Radio Times In early 1969 Cannon became editor of Radio Times, which had a circulation of 3.8 million. Brian Gearing, his successor as editor, wrote: \\"Cannon arrived, backed by a young and talented staff‚Ä¶ the changes he made were the most far-reaching ever to be introduced ‚Ä¶ At the end of the 1970s, Radio Times‚Ä¶ was still Britain‚Äôs largest and most successful magazine\\". Elkan Allan, then editor of The Sunday Times Guide for Viewers, criticised Radio Times as containing ‚Äúperipheral and tangential articles, frequently of a trivial nature‚ÄùAllan, Elkan. 'Times, gentlemen, please...' The Listener, 11 March 1976. The novelist and travel writer Jonathan Raban remembered trips to Monte Carlo, Los Angeles, the Euphrates and the Middle East. He wrote: ‚ÄúIt was no wonder that Cannon was able to engage his crew of poets, novelists and short story writers: a piece for the Radio Times would settle the gas bill, the phone bill, the electricity bill and the month‚Äôs mortgage all in one‚Äù.

London: SRC, 1992.. =Health, nutrition, and fitness= The Sunday Times, Dieting Makes you Fat  After his ten-year editorship of Radio Times, Cannon became an assistant editor of The Sunday Times. His focus on fitness resulted in regular coverage of the 'Getting in Shape' citizen running project, which he developed from Fun Runner ‚Äò82, and in the 1982 New Year issue of The Sunday Times ran a feature by Cannon with the title ‚ÄòDieting makes you fat‚ÄôCannon, Geoffrey. 'Dieting makes you fat'. The Sunday Times, 3 January 1982.

Dieting Makes You Fat listed as number 1 best-seller. The Bookseller, 30 July 1963. Cannon then discovered that an official report on the state of British nutrition and health had been delayed and allegedly suppressed, apparently because of its overall message, that the typical British diet was a main cause of many disabling or deadly conditions and diseasesNational Advisory Committee on Nutrition Education (NACNE), A Discussion Paper on Proposals for Nutritional Guidelines for Health Education in Britain, 1983.

These articles won the Van den Berghs reporting Award for 1983Van den Berghs. reporting Award, 1983.. Cannon left The Sunday Times in 1983.  New Health  In early 1984 he became editor of New Health magazine, published by Haymarket Press. From October 1984 until New Health closed in October 1986, Cannon wrote monthly columns, winning The Publisher‚Äôs 1986 best specialist columnist awardThe Publisher. Best specialist columnist (consumer), 1986. . In 1985, he originated a six-part series on ‚ÄòFat to Fit‚Äô, and in 1986 another five-part series on food additives, which won The Periodical Proprietors Association Award for best campaign of the yearPeriodical Proprietors Association. Best campaign, 1986 (with Felicity Lawrence).. Both series became books.  The Food Scandal  In 1984, with Caroline Walker, an English food campaigner and nutritionist who later became his second wife, Cannon wrote The Food Scandal, which became a UK best-sellerBestsellers. The Sunday Times, 8 July 1984. The Times ran three full-page features by Cannon derived from the book ‚Äî \\"Food, treacherous food\\"Cannon, Geoffrey. ‚ÄúThe Food Scandal. Food, treacherous food‚Äù.

Two chapters of The Food Scandal dealt with salt and sugar, both identified in the NACNE report as being consumed excessively. Brands containing these were named, including Bovril. In fact, it contained caramel, which in industrial form is not a variation of sugar. Beecham, then the owner of Bovril, sued and was granted an injunction in the High Court against the authors and publishersThe Times. \\"Libel claim as diet book withdrawn\\", 3 July 1984. In 1985, an updated and expanded paperback version was published. Cannon subsequently authored The Good Fight, a biography of Walker, who died from colon cancer in 1988.  The Politics of Food  Despite its portentous title, Cannon‚Äôs 1987 book The Politics of Food only explored how the food product manufacturing industry, undeterred by government and expert advisors, manipulated the food supply and thus what was consumed in the UK in the 1980s. It received mixed reviewsRogaly, Joe. ‚ÄúThe Politics of Food‚Äù. The Financial Times, 11 June 1987Anon. 'Politics and food'. The Grocer, 6 June 1987.

Superbug  While writing Caroline Walker's biography, Cannon discovered that in 1976 his late wife and co-author had been prescribed what would now be seen as a gross overdose of the toxic antibacterial drug co-trimoxazoleCannon, Geoffrey. ‚ÄúWhy did my wife die of cancer?‚Äù The Independent, 15 May 1990. He became interested in antibacterial drugs in general and in 1991, supported by a Winston Churchill Travelling Fellowship, he interviewed various authorities. His resulting book, Superbug, was published in 1995. He concluded that the overuse and abuse of antibacterial drugs in human and animal medicine and rearing was evolving drug-resistant bacteria and already amounted to a catastrophe. The book had low sales. Its arguments are now backed by far more generally accepted evidence.  World Cancer Research Fund  In 1993, Cannon joined the World Cancer Research Fund, becoming head of science and head and director of the secretariat on behalf of WCRF of the 670-page report Food, Nutrition and the Prevention of Cancer: a Global Perspective, published in 1997. The method devised by the secretariat of assessing evidence as convincing, probable, possible, or insufficient was adopted by the World Health Organization. = Brazil = Cannon moved to Brazil in 2000 and is now resident there.  Federal Ministry of Health  In Bras√≠lia, he worked with Denise Costa Coitinho as consultant to the Coordena√ß√£o Geral de Alimenta√ß√£o e Nutri√ß√£o (CGAN, the department of food and nutrition) at the federal Ministry of Health. He compiled a report on Alimentos Regionais Brasileiros (regional Brazilian foods), issued in 2002Ministerio da Sa√∫de. Alimentos Regionais Brasileiros. First edition. Bras√≠lia: Minist√©rio da Sa√∫de, 2002. This describes and analyses many indigenous plant foods suited to Brazilian climate and terrain that are. not listed in food composition tables compiled in the temperate global North.

Executive Board Meeting, 107th session. EB 107/2001/REC2. p2. Geneva: WHO, 15-22 January 2001. From 2001, he drafted the first official national Brazilian dietary guidelines, the Guia Alimentar, the final version of which was published in 2006Brazilian Ministry of Health. Guia Alimentar Para a Popula√ßƒÅo Brasileira. Brasilia: Ministry of Health, 2006. OS 2005/0768. This included recommendations for government, industry, health professionals, and the public.

The New World Map, The Fate of Nations  Cannon wrote two linked papers, developed from lectures given in Australia and New Zealand in April 2002. He proposed a return to the originally ancient natural philosophy of dietetics as the good life well led, of which food and eating is one partCannon, Geoffrey. ‚ÄúNutrition: the new world map‚Äù.

Asia Pacific J Clin Nutr 2002, 11 (Supp): S498-510 http://apjcn.nhri.org.tw/server/APJCN/11/s6/S498.pdf. He then wrote The Fate of Nations, subtitled \\"Food and Nutrition Policy in the New World\\", in which he proposed that the pressing need now was to conserve resources and the biosphere.  Out of the Box  From 2003 to 2009, he wrote a monthly column ‚Äî Out of the Box ‚Äî for the journal Public Health Nutrition on topics of current interest until the president of the Nutrition Society, the owner of the journal, decided that humour and activism had no place in a scientific journal. Cannon continued as a Public Health Nutrition deputy editor until early 2010.  The New Nutrition  In 2004 Claus Leitzmann and Cannon developed what became known as the \\"New Nutrition\\". They organised a workshop at the University of Giessen, Germany, where Cannon drafted, and the 23 members of the meeting agreed, The Giessen Declaration. This established ‚Äòa set of agreed principles, definitions and dimensions for this new paradigm‚Äô. The Declaration defines nutrition as a social and environmental as well as a biological science. The workshop proceedings were published in a special issue of Public Health Nutrition in September 2005.  Public health for the 21st century  Cannon was invited by the Public Health Foundation of India to give the opening plenary lecture at an international conference in Hyderabad in August 2008 on the future of public healthCannon, Geoffrey. ‚ÄúPublic health. From theory and discussion to agreement and action‚Äù. In Report of the International Conference on New Directions in Public Health Education in Low and Middle Income Countries.

Brazil held the presidency of the World Federation of Public Health Associations (WFPHA) in 2009, and Cannon was a member of the Brazilian delegation to the 12th meeting in Istanbul. He drafted the WFPHA Istanbul Declaration: Health, the First Human Right‚ÄúIstanbul Declaration. Health: the First Human Right‚Äù. World Federation of Public Health Associations. https://www.wfpha.org/images/declarations/WFPHA_Istanbul_Declaration.pdf. Cannon continued working for the World Cancer Research Fund after moving to Brazil, mainly as chief editor of its second report, published in 2007, and of a separate policy report published in 2009. His work for WCRF ceased in 2012.  World Nutrition  In 2010 the World Public Health Nutrition Association launched a monthly online journal, World NutritionWorld Nutrition, Vol 1, No 1. 2010. https://worldnutritionjournal.org/index.php/wn/issue/view/60. Cannon designed, edited, and wrote a monthly column and editorial for the journal, ceasing as editor in 2016.  NOVA, ultra-processing and the new Guia  In early 2009, Cannon as a deputy editor of Public Health Nutrition, invited Carlos Monteiro of the University of SƒÅo Paulo to write a commentary whose title was ‚ÄòNutrition and health. The issue is not food, nor nutrients, so much as processing‚Äô. In the USA, the thesis was immediately supported by Michael Pollan and by Marion Nestle. By 2012, the team led by Monteiro and now including Cannon, in consultation with investigators in other countries, developed the thesis into what became known as the NOVA classification. This divides all foods into four groups, according to the nature, extent and purpose of processing; unprocessed and minimally processed; processed culinary ingredients; processed foods; and ultra-processed foods. The team was in 2012 invited by the Brazilian federal Ministry of Health to draft the text of the second official national dietary guidelines. Published in 2014 in Spanish and English as well as Portuguese, these are based on the NOVA classificationMinistry of Health. Dietary Guidelines for the Brazilian Population. Second edition. Bras√≠lia: Ministry of Health, 2014. http://bvsms.saude.gov.br/bvs/publicacoes/dietary_guidelines_brazilian_population.pdf. Uruguay, Peru, and Ecuador have also published national official dietary guidelines using the NOVA food classification, and they feature in a 2019 French official government reportProgramme Nationale Nutrition Sant√© 2019-2023 (Report). R√©publique Fran√ßaise. Minist√®re des Solidarit√©s et de la Sant√©. 2019. Monteiro, Cannon, and many other authors have published extensively on the NOVA system and its implications for nutrition, public health, society, economics, and the environment. Personal life After graduating from Balliol, Cannon lived in the Bayswater, Hampstead, and Battersea areas of London from 1961 to 1968 with his first wife Antonia and their three children, Benedict, Matthew and Lucy.

The typical example sentence used to typify this phenomenon is More people have been to Russia than I have. The effect has also been observed in other languages. Some studies have suggested that, at least in English, the effect is stronger for sentences whose predicate is repeatable. The effect has also been found to be stronger in some cases when there is a plural subject in the second clause. Overview of ungrammaticality Escher sentences are ungrammatical because a matrix clause subject like more people is making a comparison between two sets of individuals, but there is no such set of individuals in the second clause. For the sentence to be grammatical, the subject of the second clause must be a bare plural. Linguists have marked that it is \\"striking\\" that despite the grammar of these sentences not possibly having a meaningful interpretation that people so often report that they sound acceptable, and that it is \\"remarkable\\" that people seldom notice any error. History Penrose stairs: \\"As this object is examined by following its surfaces, reappraisal has to be made very frequently.\\" Mario Montalbetti's 1984 Massachusetts Institute of Technology dissertation has been credited as being the first to note these sorts of sentences; in his prologue he gives acknowledgements to Hermann Schultze \\"for uttering the most amazing */? sentence I've ever heard: More people have been to Berlin than I have\\", although the dissertation itself does not discuss such sentences. Parallel examples with Russia instead of Berlin were briefly discussed in psycholinguistic work in the 1990s and 2000s by Thomas Bever and colleagues.; ; ; . Geoffrey K. Pullum wrote about this phenomenon in a 2004 post on Language Log after Jim McCloskey brought it to his attention. In a post the following day, Mark Liberman gave the name \\"Escher sentences\\" to such sentences in reference to M. C. Escher's 1960 lithograph Ascending and Descending. He wrote: Although rare, actual attestations of this construction have appeared in natural speech. Language Log has noted examples such as: :(a) In Michigan and Minnesota, more people found Mr Bush's ads negative than they did Mr Kerry's. :(b) With him breathing down my neck, I was still able to focus on what I was doing [...] More people have analyzed it than I have, but it's a nice notion that Tiger was up near the lead and I outplayed him. :(c) I admit that more people have been to Iraq than I have, so I don't know everything. Another attested example is the following Tweet from Dan Rather: :(d) I think there are more candidates on stage who speak Spanish more fluently than our president speaks English. Research Experiments on the acceptability of comparative illusion sentences has found results which are \\"highly variable both within and across studies\\". While the illusion of acceptability for comparative illusions has also informally reported for speakers of Faroese, German, Icelandic, Polish, and Swedish, systematic investigation has mostly centered on English, although Aarhus University neurolinguist Ken Ramsh√∏j Christensen has run several experiments on comparative illusions in Danish.; ; . =Perceived meanings= When Danish and Swedish speakers were asked what (1) means, their responses fell into one of the following categories:; . ::(a) Some people have been to Paris [except me]. ::(b) More people have been to Paris [than (just) me]. ::(c) Some people have been to Paris [more (often) than I have]. ::(d) More people have been to Paris [than I own]. ::(e) Other (e.g., repeating the original sentence). ::(f) It does not make sense. Paraphrase (d) is in fact the only possible interpretation of (1); this is possible due to the lexical ambiguity of \\"have\\" between an auxiliary verb and a lexical verb just as the English have; however the majority of participants (da: 78.9%; sv: 56%) gave a paraphrase which does not follow from the grammar. Another study where Danish participants had to pick from a set of paraphrases, say it meant something else, or say it was meaningless found that people selected \\"It does not make sense\\" for comparative illusions 63% of the time and selected it meant something 37% of the time. =Ellipsis= The first study examining what affects acceptability of these sentences was presented at the 2004 CUNY Conference on Human Sentencing Processing. Scott Fults and Collin Phillips found that Escher sentences with ellipsis (a) were found to be more acceptable than the same sentences without ellipsis (b). : (a) More people have been to Russia than I have. : (b) More people have been to Russia than I have been to Russia. Responses to this study noted that it only compared elided material to nothing, and that even in grammatical comparatives, ellipsis of repeated phrases is preferred.; . In order to control for the awkwardness of identical predicates, Alexis Wellwood and colleagues compared comparative illusions with ellipsis to those with a different predicate. : (a) More girls ate pizza than the boy {did} / {ate yogurt}. They found that both CI-type and control sentences were found to be slightly more acceptable with ellipsis, which led them to reject the hypothesis that ellipsis was responsible for the acceptability of CIs. Rather, it's possible people just prefer shorter sentences in general. Patrick Kelley's Michigan State University dissertation found similar results. =Repeatability= Alexis Wellwood and colleagues have found in experiments that the illusion of grammaticality is greater when the sentence's predicate is repeatable.; ; . For instance, (a) is experimentally found to be more acceptable than (b). : (a) More undergrads call their families during the week than I do. : (b) More New Yorkers began law school this semester than I did. The comparative must be in the subject position for the illusion to work; sentences like (a) which also have verb phrase ellipsis are viewed as unacceptable without any illusion of acceptability: : (a) *I have been to more countries than Russia I have. A pilot study by Iria de Dios- Flores also found that repeatability of the predicate had an effect on the acceptability of CIs in English. However, Christensen's study on comparative illusions in Danish did not find a significant difference in acceptability for sentences with repeatable predicates (a) and those without (b). =Quantifier choice= The lexical ambiguity of the English quantifier more has led to a hypothesis where the acceptability of CIs is due to people reinterpreting a \\"comparative\\" more as an \\"additive\\" more. As fewer does not have such an ambiguity, Wellwood and colleagues tested to see if there was any difference in acceptability judgements depending on whether the sentences used fewer or more. In general, their study found significantly higher acceptability for sentences with more than with fewer but the difference did not disproportionately affect the comparative illusion sentences compared to the controls. Christensen found no significant difference in acceptability for Danish CIs with (\\"more\\") compared to those with (\\"fewer\\"). =Subject choice= Experiments have also investigated the effects different kinds of subjects in the than-clause have on CIs' acceptability. Wellwood and colleagues found that sentences with first person singular pronoun I to be more acceptable than those with the third person singular pronoun he, though they note this might be due to discourse effects and the lack of a prior antecedent for he. They found no significant difference for sentences with a singular third person pronoun (he) and those with a singular definite description (the boy). There was no difference in number for the first person pronominal subject (I vs. we), but plural definite descriptions (the boys) were significantly more acceptable than singular definite descriptions (the boy). Christensen found that plural subjects (, \\"women\\") in the than-clause led to significantly higher acceptability ratings than singular subjects ( \\"the hairdresser\\"). De Dios-Flores examined if there was an effect depending on whether or not the than-clause subject could be a subset of the matrix subject as in (a) compared to those where it could not be due to a gender mismatch as in (b). No significant differences were found. :(a) More PhD students presented in conferences than she did. :(b) More policewomen visited the headquarters than he did. =Other grammatical factors= In a study of Danish speakers, CIs with prepositional sentential adverbials like \\"in the evening\\" were found to be less acceptable than those without. Comparatives in Bulgarian can optionally have the degree operator (); sentences with this morpheme (a) are immediately found unacceptable but those without it (b) produce the same illusion of acceptability. =Neurolinguistics= A neuroimaging study of Danish speakers found less activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus, left premotor cortex (BA 4, 6), and left posterior temporal cortex (BA 21, 22) when processing CIs like (a) than when processing grammatical clausal comparatives like (b). Christensen has suggested this shows CIs are easy to process but as they are nonsensical, processing is \\"shallow\\". Low LIFG activation levels also suggest that people do not perceive CIs as being semantically anomalous.; . Explanations Townsend and Bever have posited that Escher sentences get perceived as acceptable because they are an apparent blend of two grammatical templates. :(a) More people have gone to Russia than I ... (could believe). :(b) ... people have gone to Russia [more] than I have... Wellwood and colleagues have noted in response that the possibility of each clause being grammatical in a different sentence (a, b) does not guarantee a blend (c) would be acceptable. :(a) Mary is too tall to get on this ride. :(b) Mary has ridden some ride as many times as Bill has. :(c) ‚Üí*Mary is too tall as Bill has. Wellwood and colleagues also interpret Townsend and Bever's theory as requiring a shared lexical element in each template. If this version is right, they predict (c) would be viewed as less acceptable due to the ungrammaticality of (b): :(a) Fewer people have been to Russia than I would have thought. :(b) *People have been to Russia fewer than I have. :(c) ‚Üí?Fewer people have been to Russia than I have. Wellwood and colleagues, based on their experimental results, have rejected Townsend and Bever's hypothesis and instead support their event comparison hypothesis, which states that comparative illusions are due to speakers reinterpreting these sentences as discussing a comparison of events. Similar constructions The term \\"comparative illusion\\" has sometimes been used as an umbrella term which also encompasses \\"depth charge\\" sentences like \\"No head injury is too trivial to be ignored.\\" This example, first discussed by Peter Cathcart Wason and Shuli Reich in 1979, is very often initially perceived as having the meaning \\"No head injury should be ignored‚Äîeven if it's trivial\\", even though upon careful consideration the sentence actually says \\"All head injuries should be ignored‚Äîeven trivial ones.\\" Phillips and colleagues have discussed other grammatical illusions with respect to attraction, case in German, binding, and negative polarity items; speakers initially find such sentences acceptable, but later realize they are ungrammatical.

He served between 1978-1985 as West Germany's first Federal Commissioner for Data Protection. It was widely believed that he was appointed at the eleventh hour only after the anticipated appointee, Spiros Simitis, had turned the job down because previously agreed levels of resourcing were dramatically cut at the last minute. Bull took on the job in an atmosphere of continuing scepticism over the levels of government commitment to data protection and Information Technology legislation more generally.  Life  Bull was born at L√ºbben (Spreewald), a small town in the marshy countryside to the south of Berlin. Hans-Joachim Bull (1906‚Äì1977), his father, was a lawyer and a judge whom Bull has described (in print) as \\"a self-confident choleric man with rigid principles, most of which dated back to the days of the kaiser...\\". The family - Hans Peter Bull, his two-year-old sister, the parents and his grandmother - fled L√ºbben on 19 April 1945 as the Red army advanced from the east. Under Soviet Military Administration they were obliged to return to their point of departure, but two years later they made a successful escape attempt, now exchanging life in the Soviet occupation zone for the British occupation zone. By 1947 they had ended up in Hamburg which is where Bull attended secondary school. After successfully completing his school career he had difficulty deciding whether he should pursue a career in journalism or in the law. In the end he opted for the law, although he continued to be actively involved in journalism as well. Between 1956 and 1960 he studied Jurisprudence at Hamburg, Marburg and at the Free University of Berlin. He also spent some time as an intern with Die Zeit, a weekly national newspaper published in Hamburg. He received his doctorate of law in 1963 for a piece of work concerned with \\"Verwaltung durch Maschinen. Rechtsprobleme der Technisierung der Verwaltung\\" (\\"Administration using machines. Legal problems with the mechanisation of administration\\"). Data protection challenges obsessed him long before the subject became mainstream. In 1966 he passed his level 2 national law exams, which in principle opened the way to a career as a lawyer. Then, in 1972, Bull received his habilitation, a higher level academic qualification generally seen as a necessary prerequisite for a lifetime career as a university academic in Germany. Bull joined the Social Democratic Party (\\"Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands\\" / SPD) in 1967. That was the year in which he took over as chairman of the Regional Arbitration Commission (\\"Landesschiedskommission\\") in Hamburg. He worked between 1973 and 1978 as a professor in Public Law at the University of Hamburg. Then, in 1978, he was offered and accepted a position as West Germany's first Federal Commissioner for Data Protection. Many of the concerns underlying the appointment were little understood by the political establishment, and during the next seven years Hans Peter Bull, whose own views were already thought through, did much to shape a role which over the next years provided a template for other European countries needing to find way to address abusive use of computer databases. Between 1983 and 1988 he resumed his work as professor in Public Law at Hamburg. Then, in 1988, he was appointed Minister of the Interior in the SPD regional government of Schleswig-Holstein, a position he retained till resigning at the start of 1995. He then returned again to his academic role at the university, from which he retired in 2002. He served between 1997 and 2003 as a deputy chairman of the SPD's National Arbitration Copmmission (\\"Bundesschiedskommission\\"). He is also a member of the Hamburg-based Working Circle of Social Democratic Jurists (\\"Arbeitsgemeinschaft sozialdemokratischer Juristinnen und Juristen\\" / AsJ). Evaluation In comparison with subsequent generations of Data Protection commissioners and officers, Bull's approach can be seen as relatively moderate, which may reflect his own later seven-year stint as an Interior Minister. He does not see Data Protection as a goal for its own sake, but rather as a counterweight and corrective against improper processing and use of data. He rejects what he would see as a more extensive data protection regime advocated by Spiros Simitis, Helmut B√§umler and Thilo Weichert, which he characterises as paternalism and infantilising of the citizenry. Bull stands instead for the status of the individual as a socially engaged being and stresses the need for a \\"socially adequate\\" information flow.

The award went to two recordings, the CD Didascalies with works by the composer Luc Ferrari released in 2007 and the CD Lignes with chamber music works by Jean-Luc Fafchamps.Jean- Luc Fafchamps biography Didascalies, which was made together with the Belgian pianist Jean-Philippe Collard-Neven, is considered by experts to be a reference for Ferrari's music. The recordings were also highly acclaimed in the specialist press. Thus the French music magazine Le Monde de la musique awarded the highest mark for Lignes. Three years later he received the Coup de C≈ìur again. This time for the album Giacinto Scelsi Volume 9: The Works for Viola, which includes works for viola and voice by the Italian composer and poet Giacinto Scelsi from 1955 to 1964.

Zayed was the driving force behind the formation of the United Arab Emirates, becoming the Union's first President (), a post which he held for a period of almost 33 years (from 2 December 1971 until his death in 2004). Zayed was appointed the governor of the Eastern Region of Abu Dhabi in 1946, and was based in the Muwaiji Fort in Al Ain. He became Ruler of Abu Dhabi on 6 August 1966. Following the announcement by the British government that it intended to abrogate its treaties with them and to withdraw from the area. In a seminal meeting on 18 February 1968 at a desert highland on the border between Dubai and Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Zayed and Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum of Dubai shook hands on the principle of founding a Federation and attempting to invite other trucial rulers to join in order that a viable nation be formed in the wake of the British withdrawal. Zayed's tireless determination to cement the foundation of the Federation that he saw as critical to the survival of the Trucial States as a viable political entity bore fruit when, on 2 December 1971, the UAE was founded. Zayed is often referred to as the Father of the Nation.  Memorial  The memorial consists of an open Heritage Garden and Sanctuary Garden at the centre of which is a cubic pavilion housing The Constellation, an artwork dedicated to Zayed's memory. There is a visitor centre, which includes an interpretive film of Zayed and his life.  Heritage Garden  The Heritage Garden is planted with Ghaf trees, the national tree of the United Arab Emirates, as well as sidr, acacias and date palms. A range of desert plants and shrubs planted in the Sanctuary Garden reflect Zayed's long connection with the desert, including desert cotton, henna, Caralluma, harmal and sewak, a plant long used by desert people as a toothbrush. The Garden also features a water feature representing a falaj (water channel), through which water flows constantly.  The Constellation  At the centre of the Sanctuary Garden is The Constellation, a collection of 1,327 geometric shapes suspended on 1,110 cables, which combine to form a three dimensional portrait of Zayed. Designed by artist Ralph Helmick, The Constellation's suspended shapes consist of five different types of regular, convex polyhedrons known as 'platonic solids'. The Constellation is lit at night. The whole structure is surrounded by an elevated walkway.  Visitor centre  The visitor centre is open daily from 9:00am to 10:00pm and includes an interpretive film of Zayed's life as well as multimedia presentations. Tour guides are available, offering free tours of the site and information about Zayed and his life.

Developed by Blizzard and NetEase, the game was announced in late 2018 and is planned for release on Android and iOS with no set release date.  Gameplay  Diablo Immortal is a massively multiplayer online action game in the Diablo series, designed for play on mobile devices. It is an online-only game, requiring an internet connection during play. The fast-paced Immortal is set between the events of Diablo II and Diablo III, and borrows the look and feel of the latter. The game is designed for a touchscreen, with virtual controls that overlay the display: a directional thumbstick and ability buttons. The player can aim the ability by holding its button. Each of the six character classes‚ÄîBarbarian, Wizard, Monk, Necromancer, Demon Hunter, and Crusader‚Äîhave four abilities, which differ across character classes. For example, the Barbarian's class abilities include a slamming hammer and turning into a whirlwind, while the Wizard's abilities include a beam of electricity that boomerangs back to its source, dealing damage twice. Skills generally aim towards the nearest enemy. Blizzard plans for each class to have 12 unlockable skills, from which the player choose five to use concurrently. Defeated enemies drop items (\\"loot\\") that can be equipped via a pop-up button. Players can join and leave groups that play through \\"dynamic events\\". Unlike other Diablo series games, in the Immortal preview, the mana resource is removed and newly equipped items do not change the visual appearance of the player's character.  Development  Immortal is co-developed by Blizzard and NetEase. The latter developer had been Blizzard's partner for Chinese market releases. Blizzard intended to bring the core Diablo experience to the smartphone platform. As a result, its interfaces reflect choices that would make that experience best fit the medium. By designing for a smartphone gaming audience, Immortal was designed to reach demographics and geographic regions that use mobile phones as their main gaming platform and may not otherwise interact with Diablo on other gaming platforms. The game is planned for release on Android and iOS platforms. No release date is set. Players can pre-register on the game's website for admission to playtest the beta. Blizzard also announced plans to keep the Immortal experience fresh after its initial release with the regular addition of stories and characters. The game was announced at the opening ceremony of BlizzCon in November 2018. On February 21, 2019, NetEase's CFO, Yang Zhaoxuan, stated that the game was \\"pretty much ready\\" and still planned for a 2019 release; however, he stated that Blizzard would be the ones to determine the exact release timetable. In November 2019, during BlizzCon, Blizzard posted an update on its official blog, confirming that Immortal was still in development; however, it stated that there was still no specific release date for the game, because \\"It takes significant time to meet the Blizzard quality level we‚Äôre aiming for, and we have a lot of ambitious goals for Diablo Immortal.\\" Additional details confirmed in the post included six playable classes (Barbarian, Crusader, Demon Hunter, Monk, Necromancer, and Wizard), and chargeable, class-specific 'ultimate' abilities. At the start of August 2020, at ChinaJoy, Blizzard and NetEase released a new gameplay trailer for Immortal, showcasing each of the six playable classes, and featuring the first appearance of Baal, one of the main antagonists from Diablo II and its expansion, Lord of Destruction. The trailer also showcased improvements to the game's graphics and character models, which had been implemented since the release of previous promotional material.  Reception = Pre-release = Response to Immortal's announcement was largely negative. While traditional gaming audiences often express skepticism towards diluted mobile versions of a cherished franchise, the Diablo series community's discontent was compounded by their anticipation for a larger announcement. They expressed their discontent through online channels, likening Immortal to a reskin of one of NetEase's prior games, Crusaders of Light. Blizzard responded that Immortal is but one Diablo series game in active development, and pointed to the company's multi-platform development experience and the success of the mobile version of Hearthstone as evidence of Blizzard's capacity to overcome uncertainty and do right by their core audience. Blizzard also responded to a rumor that they had withheld announcement of a main Diablo sequel due to the negative response at Immortals reveal; Blizzard stated \\"we didn‚Äôt pull any announcements from BlizzCon this year or have plans for other announcements. We do continue to have different teams working on multiple unannounced Diablo projects, and we look forward to announcing when the time is right.\\" After the reveal at BlizzCon, developers participated in a Q&A; with attendees. Two particular questions leveled at Wyatt Cheng, Principal Game Designer at Blizzard, drew significant attention from media and audiences alike, with one attendee asking if the announcement was an \\"out of season April Fools' joke\\", and another asking if it there was a possibility for a PC release, leading to the crowd booing when the answer was negative. Following the announcement, Activision Blizzard's stock fell 7% on the first weekday of trading. As of June 20, 2020, the two official trailers on YouTube stand at 338 thousand downvotes to 26 thousand upvotes for the gameplay trailer, and 760 thousand downvotes to 31 thousand upvotes for the cinematic trailer. Previews of the game's demo approved of the game's controls, its interface having been tested by prior NetEase games, though Polygon reviewer noted difficulties in precision controls. The locked abilities made some character classes less enjoyable to play; for example, the Wizard's long cast times and cooldown timers made the class less effective in groups. Demo reviewers felt that where Immortal captured the series' look and feel, it omitted some of its core tenets, or as Polygon put it, Diablo \\"soul\\". Whereas the mobile game captured the basic Diablo experience, the reviewers questioned whether the new entry had enough new content to remain fresh.

Between 2014 and 2015, they killed more than 15 people in Moscow, the Moscow Oblast and the Yaroslavl Oblast. Their victims of choice were mainly homeless and suffered from alcohol abuse issues. Many attacks were filmed and posted on the darknet and on the VK page \\"OBO16\\". They called themselves Sanitater-88 (88 meaning HH in the alphabet, short for \\"Heil Hitler\\"). On October 23, 2017, the Moscow City Court sentenced Pavel Voitov to life imprisonment, Elena Lobacheva to 13 years' imprisonment and Maxim Pavlov to 9 years and 6 months' imprisonment in a penal colony. Vladislav Karataev was sentenced to 16 years, and Artur Narcissov to 9 years and 6 months, which were to be served in a corrective labor colony.  Murders  The young people met in far-right groups in VKontakte. The leading role among the participants was taken by Pavel Voitov: he distributed roles, made decisions and actively led the activities of the gang. The motives for the killings was the desire to \\"clean the city\\", and \\"hatred of alcoholics and homeless people\\". According to the investigators, they wanted to \\"oppose themselves to others and show their superiority\\". They committed murders with particular cruelty in different parts of Moscow from July 2014 and February 2015. Victims were found not far from the Belorussky railway tracks, sometimes in the Eastern Administrative District. The corpses were subsequently found in deserted places, where there are no surveillance cameras (under bridges, near fences, garages, in abandoned hangars or on far-away glades in forest parks): * one killed at the Belorussky station, with 44 knife wounds on the body; * one killed at the hippodrome, with 18 hammer blows and 51 stab wounds on the body; * one killed in Begovaya, with 35 stab wounds on the body; * one killed under the bridge near Workers' Village, with 46 stab wounds and 2 blows from a stone on the body; * two killed on Izmaylovsky Boulevard, one of them with 15 stab wounds and 10 blows from a hammer, and the other sustaining 13 stab wounds; * one killed next to Filevsky Park, with 48 stab wounds on the body; * one killed in Nagornaya, with 9 knife wounds on the body; * one killed in Odintsovo, with 50 stab wounds on the body; * one killed at Kurskaya, with 48 stab wounds and 6 blows from a hammer on the body; * one killed on Lilac Boulevard, with 84 stab wounds on the body; * one killed in Kuskovo, with 171 stab wounds and 5 hammer blows on the body; * two killed on Bryansky Post Street, with one sustaining 42 stab wounds and 2 hammer blows, and the other sustaining 35 stab wounds.  Investigation and arrest  In the fall of 2014, operatives paid attention to a similar style of murders in different parts of the city: victims were tricked into visiting scarcely populated or deserted areas, mostly at night, then hit with a hammer first and struck with dozens of knives afterwards, the victims usually being heavily drunk or homeless, sometimes guest workers. Suspecting that all the crimes were committed by the same people, the investigators combined them into one case. But the investigation had no serious clues for a long time. Suspicion fell on supporters of Nazi ideology, and relevant groups in social networks were actively studied, but no trace of crimes in the virtual space could be found. Subsequently, employees of the Main Department of the Sledkom and FSB were able to track the mobile phones in the areas where the killings occurred. Several of the same numbers \\"fought\\" on communication towers near the crime scenes. Having researched the owners of the numbers, the FSB officers calculated the suspects. On February 15, 2015, Pavel Voitov and Artur Narcissov attacked a janitor in Vykhino, but he actively resisted. The criminals were forced to flee, and the janitor was able to testify and describe them. As a result, on February 19, 2015, the police, together with the FSB, detained 20-year-old Pavel Voitov and 25-year-old Elena Lobacheva‚Äîtheir place of residence was calculated from video cameras installed around the city. During the searches, six knives, an unregistered \\"Osa\\" pistol, clothes with the janitor's blood and a hammer were found inside their home. After some time, the police arrested two other suspects‚Äî19-year-old Maxim Pavlov and 21-year-old Vladislav Karataev. A little later, 23-year-old Artur Narcissov was also detained. The detainees confessed at the first interrogation, including to the killings, even though the authorities hadn't suspected them of the murders.  Trial  The investigation of the \\"Cleaners\\" criminal case ended in April 2017, after which the criminals were transferred to the Moscow City Court. Elena Lobacheva demanded that the jury convicted them, and this request was fulfilled. From late May to mid-June 2017, the prosecutor read out the evidence of the prosecution in court. Analyzing each episode, he showed the jury photos from the murders. At the first sessions, some jurors turned away from the photographs, but until the end of the process they had to see hundreds of photos. For the entirety of the trial, only Lobacheva's mother came to visit from any of the defendants' relatives. On June 21, 2017, the jury found all five defendants in the case guilty and undeserving of leniency. The exception was Narcissov, whom the board unanimously found guilty of attempted murder, but was divided on the issue of leniency‚Äî6 were in favor and 6 were against. According to the accusation, Pavel Voitov committed 14 murders: five on his own, six with Lobacheva, five with Lobacheva only observing, two together with Karataev and Lobacheva, and two with Pavlov. Voitov and Narcissov committed an attempted murder. Pavlov, Karataev and Voitov also robbed two people, with one of the attacks resulting in Voitov killing the victim.  About the criminals  Two members of the gang, Lobacheva and Narcissov, lived in Moscow. Elena Lobacheva had grown up on the outskirts of Moscow near the Vykhno metro station, and after school she worked first as a courier, then as an assistant accountant. Before the murders she had had a suspended sentence for a series of thefts. Artur Narcissov worked in a warehouse, also as a courier. Vladislav Karataev was born and lived in Pavlovo, 70 kilometres away from Nizhny Novgorod, with his father raising him. He previously had resided in a psychiatric hospital and had taken medication. The youngest of the \\"Cleaners\\", Maxim Pavlov, who at the time of the crimes was only 16, lived in Rostov, Yaroslavl Oblast. The leader of the gang Pavel Voitov was registered with his grandmother‚Äîa war veteran‚Äîin the Ruza District of the Moscow Oblast. During the investigation, Voitov claimed that he lived through robbing people, stealing mobile phones from passers-by. But the numerous cases listed by him, with the exception of one, were not confirmed, or at least there were not reports to the police from the victims. From five to thirteen years old, he lived with his parents on Izmailovsky Boulevard, then, after his parents divorced, he spent some time in Riga with his father, where in 2012 he was sentenced to a year of imprisonment for the desecration of graves at a Jewish cemetery. He wanted to be a soldier, so, together with Karataev and Pavlov, he tried to go to war against the rebels in the nationalist battalion \\"Azov\\", but all three were instead deployed on the Russian-Ukrainian border, and then returned home to Moscow by bus. All of the members led a healthy lifestyle, and did not drink anything stronger than beer. Subsequent psychological examinations determined that all of the \\"Cleaners\\" were sane, with the exception of Karataev, who was recognized as partially sane.

The king, Louis VI, attacked and destroyed this castle in 1110 and again in 1131 when it seemed that it was secretly being rebuilt. Little trace of this is visible. During the next 100 years, the church inside the castle was rebuilt and a priory constructed. The second castle, ch√¢teau de Gaucher II de Ch√¢teaurenard, count de Joigny, built 1232‚Äì1241, provides the layout as seen today. The third castle or chastellet, 1570‚Äì1662, reused the upper part of the second castle.Paul Gache, \\"Le Ch√¢teau-haut de Ch√¢teaurenard, Bulletin of the Soci√©t√© d'√©mulation de l'arrondissement de Montargis, vol 3, no. 57, pages 55-68 December 1976 .

Retrieved 3 November 2018. In 1232, Gaucher II, a descendant of the original Renard, was given permission by Blanche de Castille, regent during the minority of Saint Louis, to rebuild the fortress. Gaucher was married to Amicie de Montfort, daughter of Simon de Montfort, 5th Earl of Leicester. The castle was completed in 1242 when Gaucher was crucified in the Holy Land. The result was a structure exhibiting the height of medieval military architecture. The castle has 16 towers connected by walls, including the Grant Tour, a massive keep. The current names of the towers date at least from the 14th century: anticlockwise from the main gate, these were tour de la Citerne, tour Ronde, tour Rouge, tour feu Louis de Girolles, tour de Perrichoy, tour de Gastelier (or du Chastellet), tour de la Fausse Porte, la Grant Tour, tour Cl√©ment, tour Sesneau, tour au Breton, an unnamed turret behind the priory, tour au Marichaut and tour au Portier. The castle passed to the Coligny family in 1531. During the Wars of Religion, the castle was occupied by Protestants until 1568, when it was attacked and partially destroyed. However, Gaspard II de Coligny was restored to his rights in 1570, repaired the castle and built a second enceinte. These rights passed via Louise de Coligny to the children of her second husband, William of Orange, founder of the Netherlands. At the start of the 17th century, Orange installed G√©d√©on de Vaufin (or Waulfein) as governor in the castle with a small Protestant garrison. Vaufin forbade Catholics entry to the church. In May 1622, with Vaufin and some of his men lured away by an agent of Louis XIII the castle was occupied by townspeople. Louis XIII ordered the chastellet's destruction. Description Most of the medieval castle is in ruins. It comprised a keep and sixteen towers and a six-metre moat. It had five doors, the most famous of which, the Porte Rouge (red door), is the current entrance. It was reached via a drawbridge across the moat and is so-called because hunting trophies were hung there.\\"La Forteresse M√©di√©vale\\", Syndicat d'initiative de Ch√¢teau-Renard et de ses environs .

He began working on it in 1731 and it was completed and performed in 1732. The poor success of the stage premiere prompted Voltaire to cancel the printed version. Action Voltaire drew his material from Bayle's Dictionnaire historique et critique as well as from the classical original in the Bibliotheca of Pseudo-Apollodorus. The action takes place in the temple of Jupiter at Argos. √âriphyle, married to the king and commander Amphiaraos, nevertheless maintains a relationship with his rival and enemy, Hermogide. Amphiaraos falls victim to a plot. Alcm√©on, promoted to commander by Hermongide, falls in love with the queen. The spirit of his father appears to him to the temple, demanding revenge and the high priest proves to Alcm√©on that he is the son of Amphiaraos, long believed dead. In his struggle with Hermongide, Alcm√©on accidentally kills his mother.Robert Niklaus: √âriphyle, in: Dictionnaire Voltaire, Hachette Livre, 1994, p.72 Composition and reception The play was written at great speed while Voltaire spent several months in Rouen to focus on his work. In June 1731 Voltaire said he had written it, together with La Mort de C√©sar and Histoire de Charles XII in just three months. In September of the same year he felt that despite further work the play was not yet worthy of the public, or of himself. He continued revising it intensively right up to the first performance. The numerous reworkings of the scene in which Alcm√©on kills his mother were intended to ensure the effect Voltaire sought as with his other scenes of matricide (in ' and S√©miramis); not to shock the audience but to reintroduce to French tragedy the element of 'terror' which Voltaire felt had been lost as a result of the taste for gallantry on stage. Voltaire's correspondence in March 1732 with Moncrif, secretary to the Comte de Clermont, indicates that the actors of the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise may have been reluctant to perform the play: Voltaire wanted to dedicate the work to Clermont and urged Moncrif to ensure that his master recommended the work to them, so they knew it enjoyed his patronage. The play premiered at the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise on 7 March 1732. Voltaire made revisions to it until the beginning of May. The last of the total of twelve performances was on 1 May 1732. Critical reception, particularly in Mercure de France, was lukewarm. Although box office receipts for the premiere of 3,970 livres do not indicate that the play was a flop, it did not meet Voltaire's own expectations. The appearance of a ghost in the play, unusual in French drama, was one element to which the public did not respond well. Printed versions Voltaire had already commissioned the printing of the work from a trusted publisher, :fr:Claude-Fran√ßois Jore of Rouen, with whom he was to quarrel two years later. The last changes and corrections were sent to his friend Cideville on 8 May, but the very next day he wrote again insisting that the printing be stopped and the manuscript returned. He continued to work on it for many months after this, while working on new projects, but for the rest of his life he refused to publish the play, but borrowed verses from the manuscript for his later tragedies M√©rope and S√©miramis.Theodore Besterman: Herr und Gelehrter (1742-1746), in: Voltaire, Winkler, M√ºnchen, 1971, p.228 Voltaire's final trip to Paris in 1778 and the staging of Ir√©ne led to the printing, by an unknown publisher, of an error- filled stage version of the manuscript which had been retained by the actor Lekain. This version was the basis for the later Kehl edition. The 1877 Moland edition derives from a different manuscript version, owned by Voltaire's secretary S√©bastien G. Longchamps (1718‚Äì1793).

The victim turns out to be the famous actress Madeleine Thibault; in the hospital, she regains consciousness and tells her story to the investigator. In 1940, as German troops approach Paris, Madeleine Thibault, her manager, Greene, and her son Charles escape to the south, to Ciboure, where her former husband Philip, Charles' father, lives. On the way, they run out of gas. Charles leaves in search of gas and does not return. It later transpires that he is arrested by swiftly advancing Germans, and three weeks later he is released as a convinced fascist. When Thibault reaches Ciboure, the Germans are already there. After slapping a German officer, Madeleine is forced to go into hiding in her father Hyppolite's house along with fellow villager Jourdan, who hit a German officer and killed a young Frenchman who joined the ranks of the fascists. Charles comes to visit the house and discovers Jourdan. Later that day the house is raided by German officials. Jourdan is not found, but a shadow of suspicion falls on Charles. Madeleine agrees to act in a play in front of the Germans, during which her heroine kills her former lover. During the performance, which is attended by Charles, Madeleine shoots and kills the local ‚ÄúFuhrer‚Äù who is in the audience. With the help of a costume designer at the theatre, she and Greene manage to escape; however, a little later, Greene is mortally wounded on the street and tells Madeleine that Charles was among the three who attacked him. The costume designer's son initiates Madeleine into the Resistance Movement. After the end of the war, she arrives in Ciboure and learns that the Germans hung Philip before leaving the city: he also participated in the Resistance. Charles arrives with a group of friends and Madeleine recognizes one of the German officers who was looking for Jourdan in their village house. Madeleine accuses Charles of reporting his father. While he assures her that he had no part in his father's arrest and execution, he refuses to go with her to the police. Fearing exposure, he threatens her with a revolver but is unable to kill her. In the conflict, one of his friends shoots her instead. Charles and his friends are arrested; the investigator, who recorded the testimony of Madeleine Thibault, comes to their cell to release them, revealing that he worked with the Germans during the war and continues to sympathize with them. Madeleine Thibault dies from her wounds. Ten years pass, Charles arrives in Ciboure, and in the restaurant, he is recognized by the costume designer's son, who knows nothing about his past. His mother's friend Charles reports that Madeleine Thibault's murderers have not yet been found. Then he begins to praise FDR, to which the dresser's son, realizing who is in front of him, replies: ‚ÄúFrance is no longer the same. And it's not easy to break.

She is a former activist of April 6 Youth Movement and a member of the Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms. She continues to be detained by the Egyptian authorities since May 2018. Amal was born and raised in Cairo in Egypt and attended Cairo University. Before graduating, she joined the Egyptian April 6 Youth Movement and got involved in the promotion of democratic changes in the country. After the 2013 Egyptian coup d'√©tat and August 2013 Rabaa massacre, she left politics and limited herself as distant observer and an online commentator. She met her husband Mohamed Lotfy, the co- founder of the Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms, in Cairo and married him in 2014. After marriage, she focused on her small family and gave birth to Zidane in August 2015. While she was mainly taking care of her newly born boy, her husband Mohamed Lotfy, an Egyptian-Swiss National, was expanding ECRF to become one of the most important Human Rights Organisations in the country. He was firstly banned from travelling to Germany on June 2015 and had his Egyptian passport was confiscated at Cairo airport. He was travelling to Germany to participate in a debate at the German Parliament Bundestag on the visit of General Sisi to Berlin. In January 2016, an Italian young researcher, Giulio Regeni, was kidnapped, tortured, killed and his body was found on the outskirts of Cairo on February 3 of the same year. ECRF Lawyers became officially his family lawyers in Egypt operating closely with the family lawyer in Italy. The harassment and intimidation of ECRF and Mohamed Lotfy intensified. On April 8, 2016, the Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni recalled Italy's ambassador to Cairo protesting the lack of progress in the investigation by Egyptian authorities into the torture and murder of Giulio Regeni. Two weeks later, Ahmed Abdallah, the president of the board of ECRF, was arrested from his home in Cairo on April 25, 2016. He was released six months later only after an exchange of visits between the Egyptian and Italian prosecutions teams working on the case of Giulio Regeni. While the search for truth and justice for Giulio Regeni continues, serious efforts were put in place to return to \\"normality\\" and give a fake impression to the Italians, Egyptians and the world that the case is closed and dead. The Italian ambassador was sent back to Egypt in September 2017 against every human rights Organisation call, including Amnesty International-Italy. Yet, under the persistence of the legal teams in Egypt and Italy, the Egyptian General Attorney accepted to hand thousands of documents of investigations to ECRF lawyers and to his Italian lawyer in Genoa. These were translated in Italian and analysed by Regeni's family legal teams. In May 2018, the cooperation intensified between the legal teams in both countries with long phone calls setting up the strategy ahead. On 9 May Amal Fathy posted a video on her Facebook page in which she spoke about the prevalence of sexual harassment in Egypt, and criticized the government‚Äôs failure to protect women. She also criticised the government for deteriorating human rights, socioeconomic conditions and public services. Amnesty International examined the 12-minute video and found that it does not contain incitement of any form, and as such is protected by freedom of expression. On 11 May 2018, around 2:30 am, Egyptian security forces raided Amal Fathy and Mohamed Lotfy's home in Maadi in Cairo and brought them both to the police station, along with their three- year-old child. Mohamed Lotfy was set free with his little boy while Amal Fathy remained detained. On 29 September 2018, Amal Fathy, who had already spent 141 days in prison after being arbitrarily arrested for posting the Facebook video decrying sexual harassment and criticising the Egyptian authorities for failing to protect women, was sentenced to two years in prison with a bail of 20,000 EGP (1,120 USD) to temporarily suspend the sentence and a fine of 10,000 EGP (560 USD). On September 30, 2018, she appealed the case and paid the bail. The first appeal hearing was scheduled on October 25, 2018. Egyptian women are particularly vulnerable to violence in the public space, with 99.3% of women and girls reporting some form of sexual harassment and assault in their lifetime. Fathy has now been released from jail but remains under house arrest.Egyptian sexual harassment activist Amal Fathy released  World news  The Guardian Retrieved 2019-01-05.

It was described by Tilbury, in 1992 from a patch of lowland seasonal rainforest in the Matandwe Forest Reserve.  Distribution  This species was originally believed to be found across several inselbergs and mountains until molecular phylogenetic analysis confirmed that it was endemic to the remaining forest in Malawi, and the species from Mozambique being endemic to individual mountains.  Threats & conservation  It is assessed under IUCN criterion B1ab(iii)+2ab(iii) as Critically Endangered, with the caveat 'possibly extinct'. It is threatened by the conversion of land to agricultural operations and destruction of forests for small-scale logging operations that have limited suitable habitat to two 0.6 km2 patches of forest, averaging 0.29 km2 in size. R. chapmanorum requires intact forest floors to feed, and therefore is not recorded from transformed or disturbed forests, limiting further the amount of suitable habitats available for the species. Some individuals were seen in 1998 during the last survey of the area. This species is very small, growing to 62 mm, yet only small populations could persist within these patches of forest. Although some area of forest exists 3 km north, these are not included in assessments as they have recently been cleared and disturbed. R. chapmanorum is listed on the EDGE list of Reptiles as number 49, with an EDGE score of 5.72 and ED score of 18.142.

The gunman shot six women, two fatally, and pistol-whipped a man before killing himself.  Shooting  Scott Paul Beierle entered the hot yoga studio at 5:37 p.m. EDT on November 2, 2018, shooting six people, resulting in the deaths of two women, Maura Binkley, 21, and Dr. Nancy Van Vessem, 61. Officers responded to reports of gunfire within three and a half minutes, at which point the perpetrator was found deceased. Partygoers in a bar across the street told reporters how they witnessed people fleeing from the studio and that a man in a bloody white T-shirt who ran into the bar claimed to have charged the shooter only to be pistol whipped. This claim was later backed up in interviews with survivors who stated that the male customer used a vacuum cleaner and then a broomstick to attack Beierle, which gave other students time to escape. Tallahassee Police Chief Michael DeLeo also credited the students who \\"fought back and tried not only to save themselves but other people\\". The yoga studio was a part of a plaza that is occupied by restaurants and other businesses. Those eating at the restaurant underneath the studio heard the gunshots and told reporters that the owner came through the dining area shortly after, asking if anyone was a doctor.  Victims  When officers arrived, it was discovered that six people had been shot during the attack. Two victims, Maura Binkley and Nancy Van Vessem, were deceased at the scene. Maura Binkley, age 21, was a student at Florida State University, and due to graduate in 2019. Dr. Nancy Van Vessem, age 61, was a doctor and the chief medical director for Capital Health Plan. She was also a faculty member at Florida State.  Perpetrator  Scott Paul Beierle was later revealed as the perpetrator by police. According to his social media profiles on Facebook and LinkedIn, Beierle was a military veteran and former teacher for the Anne Arundel County Public School System in Maryland, teaching both English and social studies at Meade High School and being affiliated with conservative groups FSU College Republicans and We Are Conservatives. Additionally, Beierle has also taught at numerous other schools as a substitute teacher, yet only briefly due to performance issues and inappropriate behavior. In one instance, Beierle was fired for an incident where he reportedly asked a female student if she was \\"ticklish\\", while touching her \\"below the bra line\\" on her stomach. He had been charged twice for battery, in 2012 and 2016, where he was accused of grabbing a woman's buttocks in both situations. YouTube videos posted by Beierle in 2014 showed that he identified with the involuntary celibate community while often complaining about his sexual rejections from women. He also sympathized with the shooter behind the 2014 Isla Vista killings, Elliot Rodger, as he too felt lonely and unloved as well as posting misogynistic songs on SoundCloud. Other videos depicted him ranting about African-Americans, illegal immigration and interracial relationships.Yoga shooter appeared to have made misogynistic videos Associated Press via Yahoo! News, November 3, 2018Yoga studio gunman had history of arrests, posted misogynistic rants online CBS News, November 3, 2018 One of the videos was named \\"Dangers of Diversity\\". The FBI and the Tallahassee Police Department attested to Beierle's hatred of women, saying he was \\"disturbed\\" during the shooting. They further noted he had planned the attack months in advance.  Aftermath  Florida State University held a vigil for the victims of the shooting on November 4, while another series of tributes were planned for November 5 with the help of Tallahassee's Delta Delta Delta sorority chapter, of which victim Maura Binkley was a member. Other tributes were published by the deceased's families and friends through social media. On November 11, a candlelit vigil was held at Cascades Park. The day after the shooting, a yoga instructor of Hot Yoga Tallahassee led a yoga class for healing in the middle of Adams Street. In 2019, Binkley's parents sued the yoga studio and property owner claiming both were negligent in providing adequate safety.https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/2019/06/26/hot-yoga-tallahassee- shooting-maura-binkley-father-suing-business-betton-place-property- owner/1572775001 References 2018 crimes in Florida 2018 mass shootings in the United States 2018 murders in the United States History of Tallahassee, Florida Incidents of violence against women Manosphere Mass shootings in Florida Tallahassee Murder in Florida Murder‚Äìsuicides in Florida November 2018 crimes in the United States ","title":"2018 Tallahassee shooting"},{"id":"58953744","text":"Barnard Foord Bowes or Barnard Bowes Foord (7 July 1769 ‚Äì 23 June 1812) commanded a British brigade in several battles during the Peninsular War.

Both the ruling Tories and the opposition Whigs saw the Spanish revolt as an opportunity for the United Kingdom to effectively intervene against Emperor Napoleon on the European continent. When the Spanish authorities declined the offer of soldiers, the British government determined to send an expedition to the Kingdom of Portugal which was occupied by French troops. Britain would send 9,000 men under Lieutenant General Arthur Wellesley from Ireland, a force under Major General Brent Spencer from Gibraltar, and two brigades from Harwich and Ramsgate, altogether 18,000 infantry and 390 cavalry. On 1 August 1808, Wellesley's force landed at the mouth of the Mondego River near Figueira da Foz. On his own initiative, Spencer sailed from Gibraltar and landed his troops on 5 August. Wellesley spent until 9 August organizing his small army into six brigades before marching toward Lisbon. Lieutenant General Hew Whitefoord Dalrymple, who was Governor of Gibraltar, wrote to Spencer on 17 July that the British Army administration had not appointed Bowes a brigadier general on the staff. He therefore refused to appoint Bowes a brigadier. Dalrymple also noted that Bowes ought to return to Gibraltar, saying he was not properly attached to the command. Nevertheless, he gave Bowes permission to serve with Wellesley's expedition. Since Bowes was senior to several officers commanding brigades, Wellesley assumed that he was a brigadier general on the staff and assigned him to command the 4th Brigade with the rank of brigadier general. The 4th Brigade consisted of the 1st Battalions of the 6th Foot (946 men) and the 32nd Foot (874 men). On 17 August, Wellesley's 13,000 British and 2,000 Portuguese fought 4,350 Frenchmen under General of Division Henri Fran√ßois Delaborde in the Battle of Roli√ßa. Wellesley tried to envelop Delaborde's division. To this end, he sent the Portuguese to the right and Major General Ronald Craufurd Ferguson to the left with his own and Bowes' brigades plus six guns. When Delaborde evaded the trap and withdrew to a ridge, Ferguson's two brigades again tried to loop around the French flank. Meanwhile, the other brigades mounted a frontal attack on the French. Ferguson's two brigades got lost and when they finally appeared, Delaborde was in retreat. The following day, ships with 4,000 more British soldiers in two brigades appeared offshore near Vimeiro and Wellesley marched to meet them. The Battle of Vimeiro was fought on 21 August 1808. Wellesley posted the brigades of Major General Rowland Hill, and Brigadier Generals Bowes, Miles Nightingall, Catlin Craufurd, and Wroth Palmer Acland on a prominent ridge on the right flank. On the left flank near Vimeiro were the brigades of Major General Ferguson, and Brigadier Generals Robert Anstruther and Henry Fane. When French General of Division Jean-Andoche Junot sent a force to the north, Wellesley quickly formed a new left flank by sending the brigades of Bowes, Nightingall, Ferguson, and Craufurd north. When they reached the northern ridge, Ferguson and half of Nightingall's brigades formed the first line while Bowes and half of Nightingall's brigades comprised the second line. The French attacked and all of Ferguson's and Nightingall's troops were engaged, but Bowes' brigade did not fire a shot or suffer any casualties. On 5 September, the new commander Dalrymple reorganized the army and sent Bowes back to Gibraltar. =Spain= British 3rd Division soldiers successfully storm the castle of Badajoz. Bowes was a brigadier general on the staff from 1808 to 1810. On 7 February 1810, Bowes was sent to C√°diz with reinforcements and kept there by Lieutenant General William Stewart. Three weeks later, Wellesley (now called Wellington) wrote to Stewart, \\"I approve of your detaining Brig. Gen. Bowes, he is an officer of whom I am well acquainted, and is highly deserving of the confidence which you are disposed to place in him\\". However, Bowes returned to Gibraltar by 23 March. He took command of an expedition to M√°laga to support Spanish General Luis de Lacy, but the force returned to Gibraltar without landing. He was promoted major general on 25 July 1810. In late 1811 Bowes was assigned to the staff of Wellington's army. Bowes assumed command of the Fusilier Brigade in the 4th Division in February 1812. The Siege of Badajoz concluded with a successful assault on 6 April 1812. The three breaches blasted in the walls were the focus of the main attack. The 4th Division was ordered to storm the right and center breaches with 3,500 soldiers while the Light Division assaulted the left breach with 3,000 men. The main attack which began at 10 pm was a disaster. The advance party of the 4th Division, coming upon the ditch and thinking that the water in it was only ankle deep, jumped in. In fact the French had dug it out to a depth of 6 feet; twenty British and thirty Portuguese soldiers drowned. The survivors swerved to the left to avoid the inundation. When the advance parties of the 4th and Light Divisions entered the ditch, the French sappers ignited the incendiary devices and mines they had thickly sown. Scores of attackers were killed, burnt, or maimed in the blasts that followed. Every British engineer officer guiding the columns was killed or wounded almost at once, so the subsequent waves had little direction. The soldiers bravely charged up the breaches again and again, only to be massacred by point blank musketry and cannon fire. After midnight, Wellington ordered the two divisions to retreat. Their losses were horrific. Not counting Portuguese losses, the 4th Division suffered casualties of 84 officers and 841 men, while Light Division losses were 68 officers and 861 men. The battle was won because the secondary attacks by the 3rd Division and 5th Division were both successful. When the 5th Division broke into the fortress and fired into the backs of the troops defending the breaches, the French surrendered in a body. The surviving British and Portuguese soldiers then went berserk as they sacked the hapless city. Bowes' brigade included the 1/7th Foot, 1/23rd Foot, and 1/48th Foot. The 7th lost 49 killed and 131 wounded, the 23rd lost 25 killed, 106 wounded, and 20 drowned, and the 48th lost 35 killed and 138 wounded. While leading the assault on the right breach, Bowes was badly wounded; he was shot in the thigh and stabbed by a bayonet. His brother-in-law and aide-de-camp Captain James Johnson was killed in the battle. It took Bowes six weeks to recover from his injuries. On 2 May 1812 while still recuperating, Bowes was assigned to command a brigade in the 6th Division. The brigade included the 2nd Foot, 1/32nd Foot. and the 1/36th Foot. On 13 June, Wellington's army mounted an offensive toward Salamanca. By 17 June the Allied army began the Siege of the Salamanca Forts, a trio of heavily fortified convents manned by 800 French soldiers and 36 cannons. Someone blundered and there was insufficient ammunition for the Allied army's four 18-pound siege cannons. By 23 June, the siege guns had run out of ammunition and the walls of the forts were still intact. Nevertheless, Wellington ordered the San Cayetano fort to be stormed at 10 pm that night. The six British light companies of the 6th Division were selected to make the assault, roughly 300‚Äì400 soldiers. Bowes determined to lead the attack though this was normally the responsibility of lower-ranking officers. An engineer suggested an alternate route of attack that had more cover, but Bowes decided to charge straight up the glacis. The moment the assault column emerged from cover it was taken under heavy fire, not only from San Cayetano, but also from the San Vincente fort. Many soldiers were hit before they got close to the fort. Of 20 ladders provided, only two were set against the objective. By the time the ladders were raised, the attack was plainly hopeless and no soldiers set foot on them. Bowes was slightly wounded in the initial rush. After having his injury dressed, he heard that the attack was stalled. He rushed back into the battle only to be shot down and killed at the foot of the ladders. With his death, the attackers lost heart and ran for cover. British casualties numbered six officers and 120 rank and file. Afterward, the British requested a truce to retrieve the dead and wounded but the French refused and Bowes' body had to be recovered later. Wellington wrote, that Bowes \\"was so eager for the success of the enterprise, that he had gone forward with the storming party\\". There is a monument to Bowes in the Beverley Minster.

At the end of his racing career he was retired to become a breeding stallion in England. Background Cityscape is a chestnut horse with a broad white blaze and white socks on his hind legs bred in England by his owner Khalid Abdullah's Juddmonte Farm. He was sent into training with Roger Charlton at Beckhampton in Wiltshire and, until the end of 2011 he was ridden in most of his races by Steve Drowne. He was sired by Selkirk an American-bred miler who won the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes in 1991. As a breeding stallion, his other successful offspring included Wince, Sublimity, Kastoria and Thistle Bird (Pretty Polly Stakes). Cityscape's dam Tantina won four of her five races including the Oak Tree Stakes and the Sceptre Stakes before becoming of other foals have included the Temple Stakes winner Bated Breath.

Racing career=2008: two-year-old season= On his racecourse debut Cityscape started a 16/1 outsider for a maiden race over one mile at Newmarket Racecourse on 15 August and exceeded expectations as he finished second of the eleven runners. On 4 September over the same distance at Salisbury Racecourse he started 11/10 favourite for a minor event and recorded his first victory as he drew right away from his opponents to win \\"readily\\" by nine lengths. The colt was then stepped up sharply in class to contest the Group 2 Royal Lodge Stakes at Ascot Racecourse and was made the 15/8 favourite. He took the lead approaching the final furlong but was overtaken in the final strides and beaten three quarters of a length by Jukebox Jury. =2009: three-year-old season= On his first appearance as a three-year-old Cityscape ran in the Greenham Stakes (a major trial race for the 2000 Guineas) at Newbury Racecourse on 18 April and finished second to the Irish-trained favourite Vocalised.

Eleven days later he was partnered by Ryan Moore in the Listed Paradise Stakes at Ascot when he started the 4/9 favourite but was beaten into second place by the six-year-old gelding King of Dixie. Drowne resumed the ride when Cityscape returned from another lengthy hiatus for the Superior Mile at Haydock Park on 4 September and started at 9/2 in an eight-runner field which included Awzaan Ordnance Row (Sovereign Stakes), Fanunalter (Doncaster Mile) and the favourite Secrecy. Two years to the day since his last success Cityscape took the lead a furlong out and won by one and quarter lengths from Secrecy. On 1 October Cityscape started 4/1 second choice in the betting behind Penitent (Lincoln Handicap, Fortune Stakes) in the Group 3 Joel Stakes at Newmarket. He went to the front in the last quarter mile and steadily increased his advantage to come home seven lengths clear of Penitent in second. =2011: five-year-old season= Cityscape began his fourth campaign in the Sandown Mile on 23 April and finished second of the five runners behind Dick Turpin.

On 11 September Cityscape was sent to Ireland for the Group 3 Solonaway Stakes at the Curragh and started the 2/5 favourite against five opponents headed by the Ruby Stakes winner Wild Wind. After racing in second place he went to the front approaching the final furlong, and won by two and a half lengths despite being eased by Drowne in the closing stages. Less than two weeks after his win in Ireland Cityscape was shipped to Italy for the Group 1 Premio Vittorio di Capua at San Siro Racecourse in Milan. He took the lead in the straight and opened up a clear advantage but was caught on the line and beaten a short head by Dick Turpin. On 30 October the horse was back in France for the Group 3 Prix Perth on very soft ground over 1600 metres at Longchamp Racecourse and started favourite against eleven opponents including Nova Hawk (runner-up in the Coronation Stakes), Polytechnicien (Prix Exbury) and Sommerabend (Grosse Europa-Meile). Cityscape took the lead soon after the start and was never seriously challenged, accelerating away from his rivals in the last 300 metres to win \\"easily\\" by two lengths from Sommerabend. For his final appearance of the season Cityscape was sent to Sha Tin Racecourse to contest the Hong Kong Mile on 11 December and started a 32/1 outsider in a fourteen-runner field. He produced a sustained run on the outside in the straight and finished a neck second behind Able One with the favoured Xtension in third and Sahpresa, Apapane and Jimmy Choux unplaced.

After tracking the leaders Cityscape went to the front 500 metres from the finish and went clear of the field in the closing stages to win \\"comfortably\\" by four and a quarter lengths from Mutahadee in a course-record time of 1:48.65. Roger Charlton commented \\"The horse has been really consistent and has been training really well. He had a good preparation at home and he's come out here and not lost any weight. I thought it was the most competitive race on the card and I didn't think he'd break the track record and win by four and a quarter lengths\\". In the Champions Mile in Hong Kong on 1 May Cityscape started the 6/5 favourite but after struggling to obtain a clear run in the straight he came home tenth of the sixteen runners behind Xtension. On his return to Europe ran consistently well against top-class opposition but failed to win in four races. After finishing fourth behind Nathaniel, Farhh and Twice Over in the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown on 7 July he ran for the second time in the Prix Jacques Le Marois at Deauville and was beaten into second place by Excelebration with Elusive Kate, Moonlight Cloud, Immortal Verse, Golden Lilac, Fallen For You and Most Improved finishing behind. On 16 September he was sent to Woodbine Racetrack in Canada for the Woodbine Mile in which he finished third behind Wise Dan.

The site has been protected by the central government as a National Historic Site since 1978. Background Hirabayashi Castle is located on top of Mount Y≈çgai, a 200-meter hill near the mouth of the Arakawa River, and at the northern edge of Echigo Plain. The area is more than 200 kilometers from the J≈çetsu area, which contained the provincial capital, and was isolated from Dewa to the north and east by mountains.  History  During the Sengoku period, northern Echigo was controlled by a number of petty lords known as the ‚ÄúAgakitashu‚Äù , who were originally the magistrates sent by absentee landlords to administer sh≈çen manors in the area during the Kamakura period. Over the centuries, the position became hereditary, and these magistrates became virtually independent. The Hirabayashi area was originally controlled by the Hirabayashi clan, the original builders of the castle. However, during the Nanboku-ch≈ç period, their territory was seized by the Irobe clan. The Irobe were a cadet branch of the Taira clan from the Chichibu region of what is now Saitama Prefecture and were thus related to the Honj≈ç clan of neighbouring Murakami Castle. At the beginning of 16th century, the Nagao clan, a cadet branch of the Uesugi clan grew in power in southern Echigo. During an internal conflict between different branches of the Nagao, the Irobe supported Nagao Fusayoshi, the shugo of Echigo against Nagao Tamekage, the deputy shugo. Tamekage ordered the Nakaj≈ç clan, a powerful neighbour to attack Hirabayashi Castle. The castle eventually fell, and the Irobe were forced to pledge fealty to Nakao Tamekage. The Irobe revolted when Nakao Tamekage was replaced by his son, Nakao Harukage, but when Uesugi Kagetora (Kenshin) succeeded Harukage, the Irobe became his retainers. Probe Katsunaga (1493-1569) achieved distinction at the fourth Battle of Kawanakajima in 1561. During the 1563 campaign against the Odawara H≈çj≈ç, he captured Sano Castle in K≈çzuke and was ranked as seventh among Kenshin's generals. After the death of Kenshin in 1578, the Irobe supported his successor Uesugi Kagekatsu. However, in 1598, Uesugi Kagekatsu was transferred to Aizu by Toyotomi Hideyoshi, and the Irobe also accompanied him. Hirabayashi Castle was abandoned and fell into ruin afterwards. Design of Hirabayashi Castle Hirabayashi Castle was typical of Sengoku period mountain forts in that it consisted of several enclosures spread across a long and narrow ridge, utilising the natural terrain as part of its defences. The inner bailey is located at the top of the mountain, and is roughly pentagonal in shape, and was protected by a simple clay wall. The main gate to the inner bailey as a large \\"masugata\\" gate.

The church describes itself as \\"an old-fashioned, independent, fundamental, King James Bible-only, soul-winning Baptist church.\\" Members of the church meet in an office space that is located inside a strip mall. Anderson established the church in December 2005 and remains its pastor. In August 2009, the church received national attention when Anderson stated in a sermon that he was praying for the death of then-president Barack Obama. The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) listed Faithful Word Baptist Church as an anti-gay hate group, citing its pastor's \\"extremely radical stance\\" that homosexuals should be judged and executed according to the Law of Moses. Since then, as the church has grown, it has received media attention for its documentary titled Marching to Zion, which the Anti-Defamation League labeled antisemitic; media attention has also focused on the pastor being refused entry to South Africa, Botswana, Jamaica, Canada, the United Kingdom, the European Union, the Republic of Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand . Doctrine Faithful Word Baptist Church believes that the King James Bible is the inspired and inerrant Word of God. It is Trinitarian and rejects modalism. The church also believes in the post-tribulation rapture, salvation by grace through faith, and eternal torment in hell for the unsaved. Among the church's beliefs is the view that life begins at conception, the view that homosexuality is a sin and an abomination which God punishes with the death penalty, and opposition to worldliness, formalism, modernism, and liberalism. Faithful Word Baptist Church is strictly anti-abortion. In vitro fertilization is seen as murder, because embryos are discarded during the process. In contrast to other KJV-only independent fundamental Baptist churches, Faithful Word Baptist Church teaches supersessionism. Although the church rejects traditional Calvinism, it teaches a doctrine of \\"reprobation\\" (named after Romans 1:28), which states that people who reject the gospel of Jesus Christ too many times are \\"given over\\" by God to a reprobate mind, after which time they can never be saved. Anderson has preached against feminism, including stating that men are meant to be the leaders and called Iceland \\"a feminist hell.\\" History=Establishment= Anderson established the church on Christmas Day, 2005. The church's website states, \\"Faithful Word Baptist Church is a totally independent Baptist church, and Pastor Anderson was sent out by a totally independent Baptist church to start it the old-fashioned way by knocking on doors and winning souls to Christ.\\" About a year and a half later the church was moved to a strip mall that was also used by Anderson's fire alarm installation business. When he was questioned about the relationship between his for-profit business and his not-for-profit church in 2009, Anderson responded angrily. By 2015, the congregation numbered around 300 members. =National attention over Anderson's sermon on President Obama= The church received national attention in the United States in August 2009, when Anderson reportedly gave a sermon--entitled Why I Hate Barack Obama --in which he said he prayed for the death of the president.Felten, David; Procter-Murphy, Jeff (2012). Living the Questions: The Wisdom of Progressive Christianity. HarperCollins , Blewett, James (2010). Can I Get Baptized in Fruit Punch? Tate Publishing, Wright, John (2011). The Obama Haters: Behind the Right-Wing Campaign of Lies, Innuendo & Racism. Potomac Books, John Avlon. (2010). Wingnuts: How the Lunatic Fringe is Hijacking America. Beast Books, Anderson did not solicit the killing of Obama but he did suggest that the country would \\"benefit\\" from his death. Anderson also told the local television station KNXV-TV that he would like it if Obama were to die of natural causes because he does not \\"want him to be a martyr\\" and he also believes that \\"we don't need another holiday.\\" Anderson told columnist Michelangelo Signorile that he \\"would not judge or condemn\\" anyone who killed the president. Anderson's invective against Obama is partially based on his opposition to Obama's support for abortion rights. Anderson was then the recipient of death threats while a group, People Against Clergy Who Preach Hate, organized a \\"love rally\\" which was attended by approximately one hundred people outside the church. The day after Anderson delivered his Why I Hate Barack Obama sermon, a church member, Chris Broughton, carried an AR-15 semiautomatic rifle and a pistol to the Phoenix Convention Center, where President Obama was speaking. Broughton explained that he was not motivated by the sermon although he agreed with it. The New Mexico Independent reported that Broughton's appearance at the rally was part of a publicity stunt that was organized by conservative radio talk show host Ernest Hancock, who also came to the rally armed, and engaged in a staged interview with Broughton which was later broadcast on YouTube. Anderson told ABC News affiliate KNXV-TV in Phoenix that the Secret Service contacted him after this event. =Anti-gay comments and hate group designation= The SPLC has listed the church as an anti-gay hate group, noting that in his anti-LGBT rhetoric, Anderson described gays as \\"sodomites who recruit through rape\\" and \\"recruit through molestation.\\" In explaining the hate group designation, the SPLC noted Anderson's position that homosexuals should be killed, citing a sermon in which he said, \\"The biggest hypocrite in the world is the person who believes in the death penalty for murderers but not in the death penalty for homosexuals.\\" A few days after the listing, Anderson stated, \\"I do hate homosexuals and if hating homosexuals makes our church a hate group then that's what we are.\\" In late 2014 Anderson told his congregation that an AIDS- free Christmas would be possible \\"Because if you executed the homos like God recommends, you wouldn‚Äôt have all this AIDS running rampant.\\" Anderson has also been vocal in expressing his hatred for transgender people, stating during a sermon titled 6 Types of Prayer that he hopes that Caitlyn Jenner's heart explodes. In a sermon, Anderson said that in the November 2015 Paris attacks the victims brought the attack upon themselves by being devil worshipers for attending a concert by the Eagles of Death Metal band, and he also said that France was a sinful nation. In a video which he posted on YouTube following the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting, Anderson said it was good that there were \\"50 less pedophiles in this world,\\" but he also said that it was bad that there were survivors. He also said that there would be a backlash against gun rights and religious fundamentalism, both Christian and Islamic. He also said that the killings should not have been carried out by a vigilante, instead, he believes that they should have been carried out \\"through the proper channels by a righteous government.\\" = Controversial videos = In March 2015, Anderson produced a documentary titled Marching to Zion, in which he argued that the anticipated Jewish messiah is the Antichrist, the Star of David is, in fact, the Star of Remphan, and the Talmud is blasphemous. In May 2015, Anderson promoted Holocaust denial by posting a YouTube video titled The Holocaust Hoax Exposed.

History Ptolemy's Geography (2nd century AD) names Rhaiba (‚ÄòŒ°Œ±ŒπŒ≤Œ±) as one of the settlements of the Leinster region. This was traditionally taken to refer to Rheban, although modern writers see a site nearer Ireland's centre as more likely: the Hill of Uisneach, Rathcroghan or Carnfree.http://www.romaneranames.uk/essays/ireland.pdf The remains of a much older ringfort, known as the Moat of Rheban, lie about 1 km to the south of the castle.Walter Fitzgerald, Castle Rheban, Journal of the Co. Kildare Archaeological Society and Surrounding Districts, Volume 2 (1896-99), pp 167-178, County Kildare Archaeological Society, Edward Ponsonby, Dublin (1899) The name of the castle is thought to derive from r√≠ogh (\\"king\\") and b√°bh√∫n (\\"bawn\\", enclosure). After the Norman invasion of Ireland in the late 12th century, a stone castle was built by Richard de St. Michael, baron of Reban, during the reign of John as Lord of Ireland.https://www.discoverireland.ie/Arts-Culture-Heritage/castle- rheban/49015 He also founded Athy Priory. In 1325 the castle and surrounding area were taken by the √ì M√≥rdha (Moores) of modern County Laois. In 1424 Rheban passed to Thomas FitzGerald (later 7th Earl of Kildare) when he married Dorothea, daughter of Anthony O'More. In the 15th century it was raided by Se√°n √ì Broin (of the Glenmalure O'Byrnes), who won treasure and fame celebrated in a poem by Ferganin McKeogh. The castle changed hands many times during the Irish Confederate Wars (1641‚Äì50), falling to James Butler, Marquess of Ormond in 1642, Owen Roe O'Neill in 1647 and Murrough O'Brien, 1st Earl of Inchiquin in 1648 and has been in ruins since then. It gives its name to the baronies of Narragh and Reban East and Narragh and Reban West, as well as the local Gaelic games club, Rheban GAA. Description A stone castle of three storeys, without roof.

The dead included a six-month-old baby and six women. On the next day the group attacked another village nearby and killed 9 Bengalis.  Background  Following non-implementation of the 1993 Bodo Accord, the erstwhile Bodo Security Force transformed itself into National Democratic Front of Bodoland with the stated goal of secession from India and the formation of a sovereign Bodoland. The Christian dominated NDFB targeted the minority ethnic groups in the Bodo inhabited areas. NDFB also violently clashed for supremacy with the Hindu-dominated the Bodo Liberation Tigers Force that espoused the formation of a Bodo autonomous region within Assam. In this violent battle for supremacy the Bodo Liberation Tigers Force aligned with the Bengali Liberation Tigers for the protection of the Bengali Hindu people from the NDFB attacks. On 30 December 1997, the massacre took place in the outskirts of Nislamari (also spelled Nichlamari) about the 28 kilometers from Tangla in Darrang district (now in Udalguri district). According to Assam police the NDFB insurgents were targeting Bengali Liberation Tigers cadres in the area.  Killings  On 30 December 1997, at around 8 PM IST, a group of NDFB militants entered the Nislamari locality. They dragged 15 Bengali Hindus from four houses and fired on them. Twelve persons including a six-month-old baby and six women died on the spot. Three persons were critically injured. Following the incident the villagers didn't allow the authorities to take the bodies for autopsy till the Chief Minister Prafulla Kumar Mahanta visited the village.

McCarthy creates artworks that use a variety of media and techniques, including performance, artificial intelligence and programmed computer-based interaction. She created p5.js, an open-source and web-based version of the software Processing. Education  McCarthy graduated from MIT with a BS in Computer Science and a BS in Art and Design. At MIT she studied technology's impact on physical interactions with her work,Tools For Improved Social Interactions, where she made an Anti-Daydreaming Device, a Happiness Hat, and a Body Contact Training Suit out of a knitted, wearable material. The devices included sensors to monitor the wearer and evoke uncomfortable stimuli if the user is not doing what the piece is designed to achieve. For example, if the user does not smile big enough while wearing the Happiness Hat a spike would poke the back of their neck. For her thesis at MIT, McCarthy focused on the similarities between virtual and physical interactions by comparing gym culture and social networking culture. McCarthy received her MFA degree from UCLA in 2011, where she has been an assistant professor since 2016. Artificial intelligence projects McCarthy often creates works that humanize the roles that smart devices like Amazon Alexa or Google Home take on. The idea for most of these projects was rooted in McCarthy's social anxiety. Getting to know people, and the small talk necessary to build connections is something that is stressful for McCarthy. She stated that she felt jealous of how Amazon Alexa automatically has an intimate place in people's lives. In 2017, for her work LAUREN, she installed cameras, microphones and speakers in her apartment, then interacted with visitors by performing the role of assistive technology, similar to Amazon Alexa. The roles were reversed in her project SOMEONE, where visitors had 24-hour access and control of McCarthy's home. In her collaborative work, Waking Agents, visitors are prompted to lie down and use \\"smart\\" pillows that can have conversations, play music, ask the users name, tell stories and be an overall guiding intelligence. The users were unaware that the \\"smart\\" pillows they were conversing with were actually human performers with their voices disguised to sound like A.I. robots. McCarthy collaborated with David Leonard, in the project I.A. Suzie, to evaluate how artificial intelligence is used as a care-taking device, and how the user creates a relationship with the device. For this project, McCarthy and Leonard acted as a smart home device in the home of Mary Ann, a 80-year old woman living in North Carolina. For a week straight they had 24-hour watch over Mary Ann and had the ability to speak with her, control the lights and activate the appliances.  Social media projects  McCarthy explored projects regarding social media in an effort to connect others and meet new people with the help of technology. McCarthy wished there was a computer program that could scour through social media profiles and automatically make her friends in real life. She decided to manually do this in her work, Friend Crawl, a project she live streamed on the internet. For 10 hours a day for a week, McCarthy looked at 1,000+ social media profiles, spending about five minutes per profile. Another project she live streamed was her 2013 work, Social Turkers. McCarthy wanted to explore what including an unbiased third-party would do to a social situation and if they could provide her with helpful instruction. To make this happen, McCarthy employed Amazon Turk workers to comment on OkCupid dates that she secretly recorded and live streamed. McCarthy actually met her husband through this project, when one day he was watching one of the live streams. One the website McCarthy made for the project, she has 16 public logs that ranges from January 4th to January 30th. These logs include her personal thoughts on how the dates went as well as the Turk Workers entry transcripts that McCarthy received. McCarthy helped create Social Soul, a large instillation for the TED Conference with Delta Air Lines and MKG. She her partner Kyle McDonald worked to bring the Twitter pages of participants, TED presenters, and attendees to life. To do this they streamed the social media profiles in an immersive 360 degree environment, where the viewer is surrounded with monitors, mirrors and sounds all relating to an individual‚Äôs specific feed. This project had custom algorithms to match the viewer with other attendees by showing them the strangers social feed. Once the viewer left the simulation they received a tweet connecting them to the person that the algorithm matched them with, so after streaming another's social media fee they could connect with that individual in person. In Follower, a 2016 work, users could use an app to voluntarily request a person to follow them around New York for an entire day, without knowing the identity of the follower. McCarthy collaborated with Kyle McDonald again in the work How We Act Together, which encourages viewers to follow computer-generated prompts to interact with video persona by nodding, screaming, greeting or making eye contact with the projection.

Playing his club cricket in Dublin for Dublin University, Maxwell made his debut in first-class cricket for the university against the Marylebone Cricket Club at College Park in May 1895. In June, he toured England with the university, playing a further two first-class matches against Cambridge University at Cambridge, and Leicestershire at Leicester. He made a final first-class appearance for the university in July, when Cambridge University visited Dublin for the return fixture between the sides. Across his four first-class matches, Maxwell scored 105 runs at an average of 13.12, with a highest score of 39. He emigrated to Australia not long after, where he practiced medicine at Kalgoorlie in Western Australia. He died there, on Saint Patrick's Day, in March 1902. He is buried at Kalgoorlie Cemetery.

The challenges of promoting affordable housing varies by location.  Australia  Australians in receipt of many social security benefits from Centrelink who rent housing from a private landlord are eligible for rent assistance. Rent assistance is a subsidy paid directly to the tenant in addition to the basic Centrelink benefit such as the Age Pension or the Disability Pension. The amount of rent assistance paid depends on the amount of rent payable, whether the tenant has dependents and how many dependents there are. Tenants who live in public housing in Australia are not eligible for rent assistance. Australians buying a home for the first time are eligible for a first home owner grant. These grants were introduced on 1 July 2000 and are jointly funded by the Commonwealth government and the state and territory governments. First home buyers are currently eligible for a grant of A$7000 to alleviate the costs of entering the housing market. The Commonwealth government in 2008 introduced first home saver accounts, whereby those saving for a new home are eligible for government contributions to their savings account, subject to conditions. = Western Australia = Department of Housing Affordable Homes Scheme  The long-term goal of the Department is to deliver at least 20,000 more affordable homes by 2020 for low to moderate income earners, through the Opening Doors Scheme. Opening Doors offers two ways for Western Australians to own their own homes. = Shared Home Ownership = The Shared Home Ownership is the only scheme of its kind in Australia. This scheme is similar to one which was set by the Housing Authority in Malta (Europe). Western Australians can purchase their own home with help from the Department of Housing with a SharedStart loan through Keystart, the Governments lending provider. With shared ownership, the initial cost of buying a home is reduced, as the Department retains up to 30% of the property. The Department's share depends on your borrowing capacity, household size, and the location and type of property. In the future, the buyer may have the option to purchase the full amount or sell the home back to the Department. With a ShareStart loan you can purchase newly built homes and off- the‚Äìplan properties offered by the Department of Housing. = Affordable House Sales = The Department of Housing (the Housing Authority), through the Housing Authority, now offers Affordable House Sales to the general public. Properties are available to anyone interested in purchasing a home. The Department works closely with industry to ensure that properties being developed for sale are affordable for those on low-to-moderate incomes.  Canada  In Canada affordability is one of three elements (adequacy, suitability) used to determine core housing needs. =Ontario= In 2002, the Social Housing Services Corporation (SHSC) was created by Province of Ontario to provide group services for social housing providers (public, non-profit and co-op housing) following the downloading of responsibility for over 270,000 social housing units to local municipalities. It is a non-profit corporation governed by a board of municipal, non-profit and co-op housing representatives. Its mandate is to provide Ontario housing providers and service managers with bulk purchasing, insurance, investment and information services that add significant value to their operations. With an annual budget of $4.5 million, SHSC and its two subsidiaries, SOHO and SHSC Financial Inc. offers a dedicated insurance program for social housing providers, bulk gas purchasing and an innovative energy efficiency retrofit program that coordinates energy audits, expertise, funding, bulk purchasing of energy- efficient goods, training and education, and data evaluation. SHSC manages and provides investment advice to housing providers on capital reserves valued at more than $390 million. Working closely with other housing sector organizations and non-governmental organizations, SHSC also supports and develops independent housing-related research, including a new Housing Internship program for graduate-level researchers. =British Columbia= Recently there has been a move toward the integration of affordable social housing with market housing and other uses, such as the 2006‚Äì10 redevelopment of the Woodward's building site in Vancouver. Legislation to help make home ownership accessible to middle-class families, and other measures aimed to make sure that British Columbians can continue to live, work and raise families in British columbia such as increasing rental property supply was passed and will take effect on August 2, 2016. China China is also experiencing a gap between housing price and affordability as it moves away from an in-kind welfare benefit system to a market-oriented allocation system (Hui et al. 2007). Most urban housing prior to 1978 in the planned-economy era consisted of nearly free dwellings produced and allocated by the unsustainable single-channel state-funded system. The goal of China's housing reform started in 1978 was to gradually transform housing from a \\"free good\\" to a \\"subsidized good\\" and eventually to a \\"commodity\\", the price of which reflects true production costs and a market profit margin. In 1998 China accelerated its urban housing reform further moving away from an in-kind welfare benefit system to a market-oriented allocation system, with the state reducing its role in housing provision. The reform is followed by increasing home ownership, housing consumption, real estate investment, as well as skyrocketing housing price. High housing price is a major issue in a number of big cities in China. Started in 2005, high housing appreciation rate became serious affordability problem for middle and low income families: in 2004 the housing appreciation rate of 17.8%, almost twice the income growth rate 10% (NBSC 2011). Municipal governments have responded to the calling for increase housing supply to middle and low-income families by a number of policies and housing programs, among which are the Affordable Housing Program and the Housing Provident Fund Program. The Affordable Housing Program (commonly known as the \\"Economical and Comfortable Housing Program, or ÁªèÊµéÈÄÇÁî®Êàø) is designed to provide affordable housing to middle- to low-income households to encourage home ownership. In 1998 the Department of Construction and Ministry of Finance jointly promulgated \\"The Method of Urban Affordable Housing Construction Managing,\\" marked the start of the program. Aimed at middle- to low-income households (annual income less than 30,000 to 70,000 RMB according to size of household and the specific area), this public housing program provides housing (usually 60‚Äì110 square meters) at affordable price (usually 50‚Äì70% market price). Within the policies and mandates set by the central government, local governments are responsible for the operation of the program. Local governments usually appropriate state-owned land to real estate developers, who are responsible for the finance and construction of affordable housing. The profit for real estate developers are controlled to be less than 3%, so as to keep the price of housing at the affordable level. Individuals need to apply for the affordable housing through household and income investigation. The program is controversial in recent years because of insufficient construction, poor administration, and widespread corruption. Local government has limited incentive to provide affordable housing, as it means lower revenue from land-transferring fees and lower local GDP. As a result, the funding of the program has been decreasing ever from its inception, and the affordable housing construction rate dropped from 15.6% (1997) to 5.2% (2008). Because of the limited supply of affordable housing and excessive housing demand from the middle- to low-income populations, affordable housing are usually sold at high market price. In many cities ineligible high-income households own affordable housing units whereas many qualified families are denied access. Housing Provident Fund (HPF) Program is another policy effort to provide affordable housing. China introduced the Housing Provident Fund (HPF) program nationwide in 1995. It is similar to housing fund programs in other countries such as Thailand and Singapore. HPF provides a mechanism allowing potential purchasers who have an income to save for and eventually purchase a unit dwelling (which may be a formerly public housing unit). The HPF includes a subsidized savings program linked to a retirement account, subsidized mortgage rates and price discounts for housing purchase.  Mali  Development Workshop, a Canadian and French NGO, has brought a real alternative to the inhabitants to accede to affordable housing that fights the environmental degradation and offers training and employment for many people who were under-employed or unemployed. The project has received many awards, such as the UN-Habitat-United Nations Human Settlements Programme award. One of the key aspects of the project is the introduction of a woodless construction and new techniques to build public buildings, offices, and simple shelters among other examples. This process increases the demand for skilled builders, and as a consequence training courses became necessary. The economic cost of the building decreases, and as a result over 1,000 woodless buildings had been built. India In India, it is estimated that in 2009‚Äì10, approximately 32% of the population was living below the poverty lineWorld Bank. India Country Overview September 2011. 32% is the 2009‚Äì10 estimate, down from 37% in 2004‚Äì05. and there is huge demand for affordable housing. The deficit in Urban housing is estimated at 18 million units most of which are amongst the economically weaker sections of the society. Some developers are developing low cost and affordable housing for this population. The Government of India has taken up various initiatives for developing properties in low cost and affordable segment. They have also looked at PPP model for development of these properties. The Government of Haryana launched its affordable housing policy in 2013. This policy is intended to encourage the planning and completion of \\"Group Housing Projects\\" wherein apartments of pre-defined size are made available at pre-defined rates within a time-frame as prescribed under the present policy to ensure increased supply of Affordable Housing in the urban areas of Haryana.

Indonesia Affordable housing in Indonesia called Rumah Subsidi,or for apartement version called Rusunawa. Republic of Ireland Affordable housing () schemes existed until 2011. They offered first-time purchasers the chance to buy newly constructed homes and apartments at prices significantly less than their market value. They have since been replaced by three new schemes: *Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan (Iasacht Tith√≠ochta At√≥g√°il √âireann): provides mortgages with reduced interest rates (2%‚Äì2.25%) to first-time buyers *Affordable Purchase Scheme: local authorities provide state-owned land at reduced or no cost to developers to facilitate the building of affordable homes *Affordable Rental Scheme: uses a \\"cost rental\\" model to supply low-rent accommodation while still ensuring a small profit for landlords Philippines The government-owned Bases Conversion and Development Authority (BCDA) is currently developing New Clark City, a new metropolis designed to be \\"smart, green and disaster-resilient\\". New Clark City is envisioned to hold over 1.2M people and the BCDA will be building an affordable housing units for its workers. Turkey Housing Agency of Turkey (TOKƒ∞) is responsible for construction of houses for lower income. Low income segment houses have longer payments, and generally equal to a month‚Äôs rent. Owners are chosen by draw. Applications are limited to people without homes in the same state and limited by monthly income (5,500 TRY as of September 2020). TOKƒ∞ also constructs houses without application limits, however these have similar prices with market.  United Kingdom  The British housing market in the late 1980s and early 1990s experienced an almost unprecedented set of changes and pressures. A combination of circumstances produced the crisis, including changes in demography, income distribution, housing supply and tenure, but financial deregulation was particularly important. Housing affordability became a significant policy issue when the impact on the normal functioning of the owner occupied market became severe and when macro-economic feedback effects were perceived as serious. A number of specific policy changes resulted from this crisis, some of which may endure. Many of these revolve around the ability or otherwise of people to afford housing, whether as would-be buyers priced out of the boom, recent buyers losing their home through mortgage default or trapped by 'negative equity', or tenants affected by deregulation and much higher rent levels. A 2013 investigation by The Bureau of Investigative Journalism found that the UK spent ¬£1.88bn ‚Äì enough to build 72,000 homes in London ‚Äì on renting temporary accommodation in 12 of Britain's biggest cities over the preceding four years.Mathiason, Nick; Hollingsworth, Victoria; Fitzgibbon, Will. 'Scale of UK housing crisis revealed', The Bureau of Investigative Journalism, 19 May 2013. Research by Trust for London and the New Policy Institute found that London delivered 21,500 affordable in the three years up to 2015/16. This was 24% of all homes delivered during that period. =A tradition of social housing in the United Kingdom= The United Kingdom has a long tradition of promoting affordable social rented housing. This may be owned by local councils or housing associations. There are also a range of affordable home ownership options, including shared ownership (where a tenant rents part share in the property from a social landlord, and owns the remainder). The government has also attempted to promote the supply of affordable housing principally by using the land-use planning system to require that housing developers provide a proportion of either social or affordable housing within new developments.Planning Policy Statement No. 3: Housing, Department of Communities and Local Government 2006 This approach is known in other countries with formal zoning systems as inclusionary zoning, whilst the current mechanism in the UK is through the use of a S.106 Agreement. In Scotland the equivalent is a Section 75 planning agreement. (Section 75 of the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1997) =Council houses= A high proportion of homes in the UK were previously council-owned, but the numbers have been reduced since the early 1980s due to initiatives of the Thatcher government that restricted council housing construction and provided financial and policy support to other forms of social housing. In 1980, the Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher introduced the Right to Buy scheme, offering council tenants the opportunity to purchase their housing at a discount of up to 60% (70% on leasehold homes such as flats). Alongside Right to Buy, council-owned stock was further diminished as properties were transferred to housing associations. Council Tenants in some instances have chosen to transfer management of the properties to arms-length non-profit organisations. The tenants still remained Council tenants, and the housing stock still remained the property of the Council. This change in management was encouraged by extra funding from central government to invest in the housing stock under the Decent Homes Programme. The program required council housing to be brought up to a set standard was combined with restrictions on the amounts that councils could borrow and led to an increase in such arms length management organisations being set up. In some areas, significant numbers of council houses were demolished as part of urban regeneration programmes, due to the poor quality of stock, low levels of demand and social problems. In rural areas where local wages are low and house prices are higher (especially in regions with holiday homes), there are special problems. Planning restrictions severely limit rural development, but if there is evidence of need then exception sites can be used for people with a local connection. This evidence is normally provided by a housing Needs survey carried out by a Rural Housing Enabler working for the local Rural Community Council. Housing associations are not-for-profit organisations with a history that goes back before the start of the 20th century. The number of homes under their ownership grew significantly from the 1980s as successive governments sought to make them the principal form of social housing, in preference to local authorities. Many of the homes previously under the ownership of local authorities have been transferred to newly established housing associations, including some of the largest in the country. Despite being not-for-profit organisations, housing association rents are typically higher than for council housing. Renting a home through a housing association can in some circumstances prove costlier than purchasing a similar property through a mortgage. All major housing associations are registered with the Homes and Communities Agency who are responsible for the regulation of social housing from 1 April 2012. Housing associations that are registered were known as Registered Social Landlords from 1996, but in the Housing and Regeneration Act 2008 the official term became Registered Providers. The latter also covers council housing, and developers and other bodies that may receive grants for development.Affordable Housing ‚Äì a new dawn?, Jones Lang LaSalle, 2011. Retrieved 29 September 2011. The Department for Communities and Local Government sets the policy for housing in England. In Scotland policy is set by the Scottish Parliament; inspecting and regulating activities falls to the Scottish Housing Regulator. Social housing in Northern Ireland is regulated by the Northern Ireland Housing Executive, which was established to take on ownership of former council stock and prevent sectarian allocation of housing to people from one religion. A 2017 report by Trust for London and the New Policy Institute found that 24% of new homes built in London were social, affordable or shared ownership accommodation in the three years up to 2015/16. United States Median gross rent by state from 2013‚Äì2017 American Community Survey estimates published by the U.S. Census Bureau. States with median gross rents higher than the United States as a whole are in dark green. The federal government in the U.S. provides subsidies to make housing more affordable. Financial assistance is provided for homeowners through the mortgage interest tax deduction and for lower income households through housing subsidy programs. In the 1970s the federal government spent similar amounts on tax reductions for homeowners as it did on subsidies for low-income housing. However, by 2005, tax reductions had risen to $120 billion per year, representing nearly 80 percent of all federal housing assistance. The Advisory Panel on Federal Tax Reform for President Bush proposed reducing the home mortgage interest deduction in a 2005 report. Housing assistance from the federal government for lower income households can be divided into three parts: * \\"Tenant based\\" subsidies given to an individual household, known as the Section 8 program * \\"Project based\\" subsidies given to the owner of housing units that must be rented to lower income households at affordable rates, and * Public Housing, which is usually owned and operated by the government. (Some public housing projects are managed by subcontracted private agencies.) ‚ÄúProject based\\" subsidies are also known by their section of the U.S. Housing Act or the Housing Act of 1949, and include Section 8, Section 236, Section 221(d)(3), Section 202 for elderly households, Section 515 for rural renters, Section 514/516 for farmworkers and Section 811 for people with disabilities. There are also housing subsidies through the Section 8 program that are project based. The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and USDA Rural Development administer these programs. HUD and USDA Rural Development programs have ceased to produce large numbers of units since the 1980s. Since 1986, the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program has been the primary federal program to produce affordable units; however, the housing produced in this program is less affordable than the former HUD programs. Another program is Inclusionary Housing‚Äîan ordinance that requires housing developers to reserve a percentage between 10-30% of housing units from new or rehabilitated projects to be rented or sold at a below market rate for low and moderate-income households. One of the most unusual US public housing initiatives was the development of subsidized middle-class housing during the late New Deal (1940‚Äì42) under the auspices of the Mutual Ownership Defense Housing Division of the Federal Works Agency under the direction of Colonel Lawrence Westbrook. These eight projects were purchased by the residents after the Second World War and as of 2009 seven of the projects continue to operate as mutual housing corporations owned by their residents. These projects are among the very few definitive success stories in the history of the US public housing effort. In the U.S., households are commonly defined in terms of the amount of realized income they earn relative to the Area Median Income or AMI. Localized AMI figures are calculated annually based on a survey of comparably sized households within geographic ranges known as metropolitan statistical areas, as defined by the US Office of Management and Budget. For U.S. housing subsidies, households are categorized by federal law as follows: * Moderate income households earn between 80% and 120% of AMI. * Low income households earn between 50% and 80% of AMI. * Very low income households earn no more than 50% of AMI. Some states and cities in the United States operate a variety of affordable housing programs, including supportive housing programs, transitional housing programs and rent subsidies as part of public assistance programs. Local and state governments can adapt these income limits when administering local affordable housing programs; however, U.S. federal programs must adhere to the definitions above. For the Section 8 voucher program, the maximum household contribution to rent can be as high as 40% gross income. Distribution of U.S. Median Home Values, 2005 Comprehensive data for the most affordable and least affordable places in the U.S. is published each year by an affordable housing non-profit organization, the National Low Income Housing Coalition. The NLIHC promotes a guideline of 30% of household income as the upper limit of affordability. According to a 2012 National Low Income Housing Coalition report, in every community across the United States \\"rents are unaffordable to full-time working people.\\" However, by using an indicator, such as the Median Multiple indicator which rates affordability of housing by dividing the median house price by gross [before tax] annual median household income), without considering the extreme disparities between the incomes of high-net-worth individual (HNWI) and those in the lower quintiles, a distorted picture of real affordability is created. Using this indicator‚Äîwhich rates housing affordability on a scale of 0 to 5, with categories 3 and under affordable‚Äîin 2012, the United States overall market was considered 3 (affordable). Since 1996, while incomes in the upper quintile increased, incomes in the lower quintile households decreased creating negative outcomes in housing affordability. Before the real estate bubble of 2007, the median household paid $658 per month in total housing costs (Census 2002).Table 1A-7: Financial Characteristics All Housing Units A total of 20% of households were deemed to be living in unaffordable housing: Nine percent of all households are renters in unaffordable housing,Calculated as percentage of renter households multiplied by percentage of renter households that are burdened by housing costs in excess of 30% and eleven percent of all households are homeowners with high housing costs.Calculated as percentage of owner-occupied households multiplied by percentage with a mortgage multiplied by percentage of those with a mortgage who are burdened by housing costs in excess of 30%. In the 2000 U.S. Census, the median homeowner with a mortgage (70% of homeowners and 48% of census respondents) spent $1,088 each month, or 21.7% of household income, on housing costs. The median homeowner without a mortgage (30% of all homeowners (80% of elderly homeowners) and 20% of respondents) spent $295 per month, or 10.5% of household income, on housing costs. Renters in 2001 (32% of respondents) spent $633 each month, or 29% of household income, on housing costs. Governmental and quasi-governmental agencies that contribute to the work of ensuring the existence of a steady supply of affordable housing in the United States are the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), USDA Rural Development, the Federal Home Loan Bank, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac. Housing Partnership Network is an umbrella organization of 100+ housing and community development nonprofits. Important private sector institutions worth consulting are the National Association of Home Builders, the National Affordable Housing Management Association (NAHMA), the Council for Affordable and Rural Housing (CARH) and the National Association of Realtors. Valuable research institutions with staff dedicated to the analysis of \\"affordable housing\\" includes: The Center for Housing Policy, Brookings Institution, the Urban Institute and the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University and the Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy at New York University, and the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Several of these institutions (the Fannie Mae Foundation, Urban Institute, Brookings Institution Metropolitan Policy Program, Enterprise Community Partners, LISC, the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies, and others)Partners partnered to create KnowledgePlex, an online information resource devoted to affordable housing and community development issues. =New York City= New York City has a shortage of affordable housing resulting in overcrowding and homelessness. New York City attracts thousands of new residents each year and housing prices continue to climb. Finding affordable housing affects a large portion of the city‚Äôs population including low-income, moderate-income, and even median income families.\\"State of New York City‚Äôs Subsidized Housing: 2011.\\" New York: Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy, The Institute for Affordable Housing. Since 1970, income has remained stagnant while rent has nearly doubled for New Yorkers. Consequently, 48.7% of householders spend more than 30% of their income on rent. Several federal and state initiatives have targeted this problem, but have failed to provide enough affordable, inclusive, and sustainable housing for New York City residents. = City of San Diego = San Diego's housing crisis is largely driven by the cost of the housing, rather than a shortage of housing units. According to the Housing and Urban Development, total housing costs are affordable if they meet or are below 30% of annual income. According to the American Community Survey of 2016, 54.8% of renters in San Diego pay 30% or over of their income toward rent and housing costs every month. Even with an estimated 84,000 vacant housing units, a significant number of people choose to live outside of county lines, where housing costs are lower. About twenty percent of San Diego workers live outside the county, notably in Riverside County, where median home costs can be as much as $195,400 cheaper. However, where housing costs may be lower, these workers are now facing longer commutes. The combination of housing costs and transport costs means that as many as 45% of the population working in San Diego face poverty. Homelessness is a huge challenge also stemming from this lack of affordable housing. The Regional Task Force on the Homeless counted 4,912 homeless individuals in the City of San Diego alone, with 8,576 homeless persons in the San Diego region. Multiple propositions have been made to abate the problem. In 2018, California voted on Prop 10, which would have lifted state regulations on rent control and allowed local jurisdictions to set their own policies. It did not pass. More recently, in March 2019, the San Diego City Council voted and approved a reform to parking standards on housing units near public transit with the goal of reducing housing costs associated with mandated parking spots and relieve traffic by encouraging residents to use public transit. Subsidized housing programs The Department of Housing and Urban Development's Section 8 programs help low income citizens find housing by paying the difference between the market price of a home and 30% of the renter's income. According to the San Diego Housing Commission, Section 8 housing vouchers are the city's largest affordable housing program and were responsible for helping to fill 14,698 homes in the 2014-2015 fiscal year. The San Diego Housing Commission currently owns 2,221 affordable housing units and plans to expand that number in the future to meet the growing demand. Recent policies to create more affordable housing In 2009, the San Diego Housing Commission implemented a finance plan that created 810 more units of affordable rental housing through leveraging the equity of its owned properties. The conversion of city-owned buildings into low-income affordable housing was made possible by an agreement made with the Department of Housing and Urban Development in September 2007. The cost of rent and availability of these units for residents will remain consistent, as the city has put in place provisions to make them affordable for at least 55 years. Additionally, because of a concern that the people who need these housing units might be crowded out, the units are only available to residents with an income cap of 80% of the San Diego median. In 2017, the new Atmosphere building downtown drew attention when it announced that it would be offering 205 apartments to low-income San Diego residents. Residents pay their portion of rent through Section 8 vouchers, and many of the apartments are available only to families who make 30% or less of the median income of the city. The main idea behind the new housing project was to provide a low-rent area for residents who work downtown but who are unable to live near their workplace because of the high costs. =Grand County, Colorado= Affordable housing is a problem that is affecting people nationwide, including Grand County, Colorado. According to research by Rubin and Ponser (2018), ‚ÄúIn 2016, the median renter in the bottom quartile had only $488 left per month after rent for essentials like food, health care, utilities, and transportation‚Äù (para. 4). A lack of affordable housing can be a serious problem for people, as overpaying for housing leaves families with little leftover to spend on other essentials like food and clothing. Grand County could benefit from increasing the amount of affordable housing that is available in the area. The increase of housing would allow local families to rent housing at a more affordable price, hopefully reducing stress for people. It would also attract new people to the area and provide jobs for local companies that build the housing, helping to stimulate the local economy. The increased housing would also help local businesses by making more housing available for workers. Overall, the housing could help Grand County and its residents to be a more livable and profitable community. =Housing Prices in Colorado= Colorado has seen a unique problem in housing crisis due to an imbalance in supply and demand but specifically it has been tied to supply of affordable housing to meet the demands. Colorado Springs alone is expected to hit shortages in housing of 26,000 units by 2019 and the builders are simply unable to meet the demands. The important thing to note is that the situation in Colorado is unique because it isn't the lack of supply driving up the prices, but Colorado has a lack of supply specifically in affordability. Colorado has one of the slowest markets for houses in the upper price rangers, and one of the fastest in the affordable index. The state is also plagued with one of the slowest build rates in the United States due to state's strict zoning laws around the metropolitan areas and a slow network of suppliers. Another strong issue to consider is the lack of ease and increasing costs of building homes. With tight margins for profits, it is difficult for builders to justify building large volumes of affordable homes instead of building luxury homes. The state government has acknowledged this problem and has decided to continue to work with builders in providing incentives to building a diverse range of homes in terms of pricing. The legislation and loosening the boundaries will need to come with some form of checks and balances to ensure that builders are utilizing it for its intended purpose of providing affordable housing and not simply continue the trend for housing. The argument consisting of alerting potential buyers of a 'bubble' in Colorado is false. A bubble for housing market is formed when there is an overabundance of supplies yet increasing prices. Colorado does not have this issue, rather it has significant amount of homes for sale, just not enough buyers in all segments and yet the housing prices have continued to increase. The number of buyers has continued to trend down, and the prices of homes has continued to trend up. The increase in house prices are thus not at any risk of a bubble, rather the resolution to this issue is, as mentioned above, an intervention from the state to either provide legislative mandates to diversify the homes being built to price points with a special focus on affordability or provide incentives to builders to continue building affordable housing. The concerns with supplies will also need to be tackled, but all of these issues ultimately do rest on the state performing certain actions to change the portfolio of homes in Colorado.

History First Moon Township was apparently created from Moon Township, Allegheny County at the creation of Beaver County in 1800. Until 1789 all that area south of the Ohio River that would become part of Beaver County was part of Washington County. In 1789 by an act of the legislature all that portion of Washington County south of the Ohio River that in 1800 was included in First and Second Moon Townships was transferred to Allegheny County. There is no map of Allegheny County of that period showing townships, and there is a break in the Minutes of the Court of Quarter Sessions from 1793 to 1820, two books having been lost or burned at the time of the burning of the Allegheny County court-house, May 7, 1882. But from what is yet remaining of those minutes, that is, up to 1793, and from the Road Dockets and Miscellaneous Dockets, it would appear that this annexed territory was considered a part of one of the original Allegheny County townships, namely Moon. The dockets uniformly show under the head of Moon township the petitions for roads, etc., coming up from the inhabitants in every part of the annexed region. This is the case up to 1800, when Beaver County was formed; and until 1804, when Beaver County ceased to be connected with Allegheny County for judicial purposes. All that part of the county, even as far down as Georgetown, is spoken of as Moon township. First Moon Township was one of three original townships south of the Ohio River in Beaver County at Beaver County's creation on 12 March 1800.

The plant lies at an elevation of ; the town of Chapiqui√±a lies south of the plant. The name Chapiqui√±a is derived from Aymara and means \\"bed of thorns\\". Water is carried by the long Canal Lauca to the plant and drops over a distance of to produce electrical power through two 5.1 megawatt Pelton turbines. The water is held in a reservoir after exiting the plant before being discharged into the Quebrada Cosapilla; from there it flows into the Rio Seco and eventually into the San Jos√© River. The maximum flow capacity of the plant is while the capacity of the feeder Canal Lauca is only and a more typical flow rate is ; most of the water in the San Jos√© River comes from the Chapiqui√±a power plant. There is also a rain gauging station at Chapiqui√±a.  Operation  Chapiqui√±a produces about 10.2 megawatt of power which is injected into the Sistema Interconectado del Norte Grande, the regional power grid, through the √Åguila substation farther west. In 2013 the plant generated almost 44 GWh. It operates mainly when power consumption is high and is one of the few hydroelectric power plants in northern Chile. Aside from producing electrical power, the water discharged into the San Jose River is intercepted downriver and used to irrigate the Azapa Valley; the reservoir downstream of the turbines serves to secure water delivery even when water is low in the Canal Lauca. File:PeltonSketch.svgOperating principle of a Pelton turbine File:Azapa panorama.jpgThe Azapa Valley close to Arica  History  Studies on the possibility to use the Lauca River as a water source for the Azapa Valley were made after 1945; during planning of the diversion the idea rose to use the drop at Chapiqui√±a for hydropower generation. Construction of the plant was started by the company ENDESA in 1962 and operations commenced in March 1967. Until 2017, it was the largest public works project in the Arica y Parinacota Region; the construction of the power plant was part of a series of public work projects in the 1960s‚Äì1970s in the Arica region. The plant underwent a number of ownership changes after it was built; it is currently owned by the company E-CL. It was also planned to augment the water supply to the plant by pumping water from Lake Chungara, but in 1985 the Supreme Court of Chile disallowed such pumping for environmental reasons as Lake Chungara is located in the Lauca National Park. In 2012, the Spanish ambassador I√±igo de Palacio visited the plant; in the same year quenoa woodlands began to be planted in initially about land owned by the plant as a conservation measure.

Sports career= Cricket = McVeagh played cricket as a batsman for St Columba's, Trinity College, Phoenix Cricket Club and Ireland in the 1920s and 1930s. At Trinity College he captained Dublin University Cricket Club from 1925 to 1930. McVeagh scored 3 centuries in succession for DUCC and led the team to the Leinster Senior League title in 1927. He scored 3,282 runs for Trinity, including nine centuries. Four of those came in 1927 when he won the Marchant Cup. McVeagh was capped for the Irish cricket team in 1926 and played a major role in 1928 in Ireland‚Äôs historic victory over the touring West Indies, still the only time Ireland have recorded a first-class victory over a touring team. During the 1930s, having left University, he played cricket both for the Phoenix Cricket Club and the national team, but because of his new profession as a solicitor and his commitment to tennis, he was an irregular player for both. He represented Ireland 20 times from 1926-1935 and once in 1938, and his career batting average was the highest achieved for an Irish player until the 1980s. McVeagh made 67 appearances for Phoenix, the last as late as 1957, when he had not played a competitive match for 15 years. He totalled 1613 runs for the club in League and Cup at 27.33, hitting three centuries. He also helped the team to win Leinster Senior Cup for three consecutive years in 1937-1939. McVeagh was the President of the Irish Cricket Union in 1957 and 1958. His last recorded cricket match was in June 1960 when he played for St Columba's College team. =Tennis= 1946 Irish Davis Cup team (from left to right): Gustaf V of Sweden, George McVeagh, Raymond Egan, Curt √ñstberg.

He also played at the Irish Open (known at that time as the Irish Lawn Tennis Championships). In 1933 The Manchester Guardian praised McVeagh as \\"perhaps the most improved player of the year\\". Notable in this period was a series he played against legendary American player Bill Tilden in London where he won 2 out of 3 practice matches against the professional. He was known for an \\"unorthodox style of play‚Ä¶ supplemented by his excellent ball skills and limitless energy and stamina in the game\\".

On June 6, after a surprising defeat of George Lyttleton-Rogers by Fisher, McVeagh managed to defeat Max Ellmer to carry Ireland into the semi-final. It was the first and only time that Ireland reached the European zone semi-finals. However, the Irish duo was defeated in Berlin on June 12 by Gottfried von Cramm and Heiner Henkel. In summer 1936 McVeagh played for Ireland at Wimbledon with B. T. Leader and lost to Kay Lund of Germany and Enrique Maier of Spain.

He returned to the team in 1948 winning at doubles at age forty-two. In 1950, at the age of 43, he won the Fitzwilliam Championship held at Fitzwilliam Lawn Tennis Club. In the late 1950s he also held the Presidency of Fitzwilliam LTC. =Squash= McVeagh was an Irish squash champion in the three years 1935-1937 and played on Ireland‚Äôs first squash international team in the latter year; Ireland lost 4-1 to Scotland, McVeagh being the only Irish winner. = Hockey= McVeagh was capped for Ireland hockey team in 1932 when he played for the Three Rock Rovers Hockey Club.

Extinction Rebellion were established in the United Kingdom in May 2018, with about one hundred academics signing a call to action in support in October 2018. At the end of that month, XR was launched by Roger Hallam and Gail Bradbrook, along with other activists from the campaign group Rising Up!. In November 2018, five bridges across the River Thames in London were blockaded as a protest. In April 2019, Extinction Rebellion occupied five prominent sites in central London: Piccadilly Circus, Oxford Circus, Marble Arch, Waterloo Bridge, and the area around Parliament Square. Citing inspiration from grassroots movements such as Occupy, the suffragettes, and the civil rights movement, Extinction Rebellion wants to rally support worldwide around a common sense of urgency to tackle climate breakdown and the ongoing sixth mass extinction. A number of activists in the movement accept arrest and imprisonment, similar to the mass arrest tactics of the Committee of 100 in 1961. The movement uses a stylised, circled hourglass, known as the extinction symbol, to serve as a warning that time is rapidly running out for many species. Extinction Rebellion placard containing its logotype with the extinction symbol  Stated aims and principles = Aims = Extinction Rebellion's website, at the time of the group's inception in the UK, stated the following aims: # Government must tell the truth by declaring a climate and ecological emergency, working with other institutions to communicate the urgency for change. # Government must act now to halt biodiversity loss and reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net-zero by 2025. # Government must create, and be led by the decisions of, a citizens' assembly on climate and ecological justice. When the movement expanded to the United States, a further demand was added to that group's list: \\"We demand a just transition that prioritizes the most vulnerable people and indigenous sovereignty; establishes reparations and remediation led by and for Black people, Indigenous people, people of colour and poor communities for years of environmental injustice, establishes legal rights for ecosystems to thrive and regenerate in perpetuity, and repairs the effects of ongoing ecocide to prevent extinction of human and all species, in order to maintain a livable, just planet for all.\\" = Principles = XR states the following on its website and explains the following in its declaration: # \\"We have a shared vision of change‚Äîcreating a world that is fit for generations to come. # We set our mission on what is necessary‚Äîmobilising 3.5% of the population to achieve system change by using ideas such as \\"momentum-driven organising\\" to achieve this. # We need a regenerative culture‚Äîcreating a culture that is healthy, resilient, and adaptable. # We openly challenge ourselves and this toxic system, leaving our comfort zones to take action for change. # We value reflecting and learning, following a cycle of action, reflection, learning, and planning for more action (learning from other movements and contexts as well as our own experiences). # We welcome everyone and every part of everyone‚Äîworking actively to create safer and more accessible spaces. # We actively mitigate for power‚Äîbreaking down hierarchies of power for more equitable participation. # We avoid blaming and shaming‚Äîwe live in a toxic system, but no one individual is to blame. # We are a non- violent network using non-violent strategy and tactics as the most effective way to bring about change. # We are based on autonomy and decentralisation‚Äîwe collectively create the structures we need to challenge power. Anyone who follows these core principles and values can take action in the name of Extinction Rebellion.\\"  Organisation =Structure= A volunteer for 'police liaison' during an Extinction Rebellion action. Extinction Rebellion is a loosely networked, decentralised, grassroots movement. Anyone who takes action in pursuit of \\"XR's three goals and adheres to its ten principles, which includes non-violence, can claim to do it in the name of XR.\\" The Economist identified the group as using the tenets of holacracy to operate more effectively given strong state opposition. = Organisation and roles = Extinction Rebellion has a decentralised structure. Providing that they respect the 'principles and values', every local group can organise events and actions independently. To organise the movement, local groups are structured with various 'working groups' taking care of strategy, outreach, well-being, etc. = XR Youth = A youth wing‚ÄîXR Youth‚Äîof Extinction Rebellion had formed by July 2019. In contrast to the main XR, it is centred around consideration of the Global South and indigenous peoples, and more concerned with climate justice. By October 2019 there were 55 XR Youth groups in the UK and another 25 elsewhere. All XR Youth comprise people born after 1990, with an average age of 16, and some aged 10.  History  \\"Declaration of Rebellion\\" at the Parliament Square, 31 October 2018 Extinction Rebellion was established in the United Kingdom in May 2018 with about one hundred academics signing a call to action in support in October 2018, and launched at the end of October by Roger Hallam, Gail Bradbrook, Simon Bramwell, and other activists from the campaign group Rising Up!. Grassroots movements such as those of Occupy, Gandhi's Satyagraha, the suffragettes, Gene Sharp, Martin Luther King Jr. and others in the civil rights movement have been cited as sources of inspiration In seeking to rally support worldwide around a common sense of urgency to tackle climate breakdown, reference is also made to Saul Alinsky. His \\"Pragmatic Primer,\\" Rules for Radicals (1972),Saul Alinsky (1971), Rules for Radicals: A Pragmatic Primer for Realistic Radicals. New York: Random House is seen as offering insights as to \\"how we mobilise to cope with emergency\\", and \\"strike a balance between disruption and creativity\\". Roger Hallam has been clear that the strategy of public disruption is \\"heavily influenced\\" by the community- organizing tactician: \\"The essential element here is disruption. Without disruption, no one is going to give you their eyeballs‚Äù. A number of activists in the movement accept arrest and imprisonment, similar to the mass arrest tactics of the Committee of 100 in 1961. On 9 December 2018, a second open letter of support signed by another hundred academics was published. \\"Rebellion Day\\" on Blackfriars Bridge, 17 November 2018 Extinction Rebellion has taken a variety of actions since 2018 in the UK, USA, Australia and elsewhere.How the anarchists of Extinction Rebellion got so well organised, The Economist, 10 October 2019. = UK actions = An assembly of more than 1000 people took place at Parliament Square, London on 31 October 2018, to hear the \\"Declaration of Rebellion\\" and occupy the road in front of the Houses of Parliament. In November 2018, activists blockaded the UK's Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy; unveiled a banner over Westminster Bridge; glued themselves to the gates of Downing Street; and closed an access road to Trafalgar Square. On \\"Rebellion Day\\" about 6,000 people blocked the five main bridges over the River Thames in London for several hours‚ÄîThe Guardian described it as \\"one of the biggest acts of peaceful civil disobedience in the UK in decades\\". On \\"Rebellion Day 2\\", the roads around Parliament Square were blocked and a mock funeral march travelled to Downing Street and Buckingham Palace; there were also actions in Manchester, Sheffield, Machynlleth and Edinburgh. In January 2019, XR staged an occupation of the Scottish Parliament's debating chamber in Holyrood, Edinburgh. In February council chambers were also occupied by XR groups in Norwich and Gloucestershire. A week later neighbouring Somerset County Council declared a climate emergency, citing school strikers and XR as having some input into the decision. In late February, following an XR petition, Reading Borough Council also declared a climate emergency, aiming to cut carbon emissions by 2030, a week after discussions with the XR Reading group and a day after the warmest winter day on record in the UK. In February, 'Swarming' roadblocks were held outside London Fashion Week venues and XR called on the British Fashion Council to declare a 'climate emergency', and for the industry to take a leading role in tackling climate change. In March, around 400 protesters poured buckets of fake blood on the road outside Downing Street to represent the threatened lives of children. On 1 April, protesters undressed and glued themselves to the glass in the House of Commons viewing gallery during a debate on Brexit. Extinction Rebellion, Oxford Circus, London, 19 April 2019 Starting Monday 15 April, Extinction Rebellion organised demonstrations in London, focusing on Oxford Circus, Marble Arch, Waterloo Bridge and the area around Parliament Square. The intersection of Oxford Street and Regent Street (Oxford Circus) was blocked with a boat, to which activists glued themselves, as well as gazebos, potted plants and trees, a mobile stage and a skate ramp. Sites at Marble Arch, Waterloo Bridge and the area around Parliament Square were also occupied and Shell Oil Company's headquarters was targeted. On 16 April on Waterloo Bridge, police stopped making arrests after running out of holding cells. By the end of that day an estimated 500,000 people had been affected by the disruptions and 290 activists had been arrested in London. In Scotland, more than 1,000 protesters occupied the North Bridge in Edinburgh for seven hours. On 17 April activists including 83-year-old Phil Kingston climbed onto the roof of a Docklands Light Railway train at Canary Wharf station whilst another glued himself to the side. On 18 April, the fourth day of continuous occupations at the four locations, the arrest figure had risen to 428. Also on 18 April activists held a series of swarming (short duration) roadblocks on Vauxhall Bridge. On 19 April, around a dozen teenagers approached the access road to Heathrow Airport holding a banner. Police partially cleared the Oxford Circus site, including removing the boat, whilst activists still occupied the road. The police said 682 people had thus far been arrested in London. On 25 April protesters glued themselves across the entrances to the London Stock Exchange, whilst others climbed on to a Docklands Light Railway train at Canary Wharf holding banners. Activists gathered at Hyde Park to end the 11-day demonstrations in London, during which 1,130 people had been arrested. In July in East London there was a series of seven-minute Dalston traffic blockades, a mass bike ride through the A10, Olympic park traffic blocks, and a people's assembly outside Hackney Town Hall. Also in July, protests in Bristol, Leeds, Cardiff, Glasgow and London focused on different threats for each city, with a boat in each location. Extinction Rebellion targeted London Fashion Week (LFW) in September 2019 with three days of actions in order to raise awareness about the environmental impact of the fashion industry and fast fashion‚Äî\\"the United Nations has said it uses more energy than the aviation and shipping industry combined\\". On 3 October Extinction Rebellion activists used an out of commission fire engine to spray the front of the Treasury in London with 1800 litres of fake blood, holding banners at the front of the building that read ‚ÄúSTOP FUNDING CLIMATE DEATH‚Äù. The protest was held to highlight the ‚Äúinconsistency between the UK Government‚Äôs insistence that the UK is a world leader in tackling climate breakdown, while pouring vast sums of money into fossil exploration and carbon-intensive projects.‚Äù The protesters sprayed the building for several seconds until they lost control of the hose. Eight people were arrested.  \\"International Rebellion\\" ‚Äì October 2019  Red Brigade protesters near New York Stock Exchange As part of a two-week series of XR actions which they called \\"International Rebellion\\", to take place in more than 60 cities worldwide, events were planned around London from 7 to 19 October to demand the UK government take urgent action to tackle the climate crisis. It was reported to have drawn 30,000 activists to London. Alongside the protest, talks and performances were held in Trafalgar Square featuring public figures such as UK comedians Simon Amstell and Nish Kumar, electro-pop band Disclosure and author Stanley Johnson. On 7 October, several thousand people shut down parts of Westminster in central London, blocking Whitehall, the Mall, Westminster Bridge, Lambeth Bridge, Trafalgar Square, Downing Street and Victoria Embankment. On 8 October, an Extinction Rebellion group including scientist Matthew Shribman organised for 1,000 trees to appear outside the UK parliament. Over 400 MPs collected trees, and some publicly committed to accelerate reforesting in the UK. On 10 October at London City Airport, a sit- in was held at the exit of its DLR railway station, with activists supergluing themselves to the floor. Other activists climbed onto the terminal roof while former paralympian cyclist James Brown climbed atop a British Airways aircraft. On 11 October, XR activists obstructed access to the BBC's Broadcasting House main doors. On 12 October, XR held a \\"funeral procession\\" along Oxford Street which it claimed had 20,000 participants. The same day, animal rights activists affiliated with XR (Animal Rebellion) said 28 of their supporters were arrested while attempting to block access to Billingsgate Fish Market. On Monday 14 October, hundreds of XR activists occupied Bank junction, outside the Bank of England in the City of London, London's financial district, focussing on the financial institutions \\"funding environmental destruction\\". That night police, controversially, banned all the Extinction Rebellion protests from the whole of London, starting at 9 pm, under section 14 of the Public Order Act 1986. XR continued with a protest at the Department for Transport on 15 October. XR applied for urgent judicial review of the ban. On 6 November the high court ruled that the Met's section 14 order was unlawful because it went beyond the powers granted to police by the Act. On 16 October, mothers of infants held a sit-in outside Google's London headquarters, in protest at the company's funding of climate deniers. At the same building, XR Youth climbed on top of the entrance to YouTube, with a banner reading \\"YouTube, stop climate denial\\", relating to its hosting of climate change denial videos. George Monbiot and Jonathan Bartley were arrested on Whitehall. On 17 October, XR activists targeted rail and underground services near to the Canary Wharf financial district by climbing onto or gluing themselves to trains at Shadwell, Stratford and Canning Town stations. At Canning Town, a largely working-class neighbourhood, an activist was dragged from the top of a tube train and beaten by angry commuters. On 18 October, Oxford Circus was blocked. Later, a protester free solo climbed halfway up Big Ben using scaffolding that surrounded it, and unfurled banners. On 20 October, a protest performance piece was made in the National Portrait Gallery against its sponsorship by BP, who XR claims is \\"funding extinction\\". September 2020 On 1 September 2020, Extinction Rebellion began 10 days of action called Autumn Rebellion, with activities in Cardiff, Manchester and London. Protesters successfully blocked Parliament Square on the first day and demanded that Parliament support the Climate and Ecological Emergency Bill, a private member's bill tabled by Caroline Lucas. On 2 September, activists in Cardiff held a socially distanced beach party outside the Welsh Parliament, to highlight the impact of rising sea levels. Others glued themselves to the BBC Wales building. On 5 September 2020, XR blocked access to several printing presses owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp, disrupting the distribution of the company's newspapers The Sun, The Times and The Daily Telegraph. Distribution of The Daily Mail and London Evening Standard, which are printed by News Corp, was also affected. In a statement, XR said the action was designed to disrupt and expose what it called a failure to adequately report on the climate emergency: \\"Our free press, society and democracy is under attack ‚Äì from a failing government that lies to us consistently ‚Ä¶ Our leaders have allowed the majority of our media to be amassed in the hands of five people with powerful vested interests and deep connections to fossil fuel industries. We need a free press but we do not have it.\\" 72 arrests were made. In a statement on Twitter, Home Secretary Priti Patel called the actions \\"an attack on our free press, society and democracy\\". After government officials considered reclassifying XR as an organised crime group, a number of public figures such as Stephen Fry and Mark Rylance criticised the government's move in an open letter, describing XR as \\"a group of people who hold the government to account\\". On 6 September, Police seized the \\"Lightship Greta\\", a mock lightvessel bearing the slogan \\"sound the alarm, climate emergency\\", in Kennington, South London. It had been pushed for six days from Brighton and was headed to Stratford, East London. The Metropolitan Police confirmed that they had made over 600 arrests over the period. = New York City actions = Die-in protest at New York City Hall (United States), 17 April 2019 On 26 January 2019, Extinction Rebellion NYC activists formed the extinction symbol with their bodies on the ice at the Rockefeller Center ice skating rink.

In Amsterdam more than 100 protesters were arrested after they erected a tent camp on the main road outside the national museum Rijksmuseum. In Paris, about 1,000 protesters backed by the yellow vests movement occupied a shopping centre. In Vienna, protesters also blocked traffic in the city. On 21 October 2019 on the British island of Jersey, XR activists caused disruption during morning rush hour, blocking the road while cycling slowly into St Helier. They then staged a 'die-in' in the town centre. On 6 December 2019, Extinction Rebellion activists blocked streets for 7 hours in Washington, D.C., calling for an end to World Bank funding of fossil fuels. On 24 January 2020, 25 Extinction Rebellion activists chained themselves to handrails in the Kastrup airport in Denmark, in protest against plans for its future expansion. They played fake announcements for more than half an hour in the arrivals area of the airport announcing that the airport expansion needs to be cancelled immediately to reach climate neutrality by 2025. Arrest as a tactic Extinction Rebellion uses mass arrest as a tactic to try to achieve its goals. Extinction Rebellion's founders researched the histories of \\"the suffragettes, the Indian salt marchers, the civil rights movement and the Polish and East German democracy movements\\", who all used the tactic, and are applying their lessons to the climate crisis. Co-founder Roger Hallam has said \\"letters, emailing, marches don‚Äôt work. You need about 400 people to go to prison. About two to three thousand people to be arrested.\\" In June and July 2019 some of the Extinction Rebellion supporters arrested that April appeared in court in the UK. On 25 June a 68-year-old protester was convicted of breaching a section 14 order giving police the power to clear static protests from a specified area, and given a conditional discharge. On 12 April over 30 protesters appeared in court, each charged with being a public assembly participant failing to comply with a condition imposed by a senior police officer at various locations on various dates. Some pleaded guilty, and were mostly given conditional discharges. The trials of those who pleaded not guilty are to take place in September and October. In London's April 2019 protests 1130 arrests were made, and during the two-week October 2019 actions in London as part of \\"International Rebellion\\", 1832 arrests were made. This included the Green Party Member of European Parliament for the West Midlands, Ellie Chowns, as well as Green Party co-leader and Leader of the opposition on Lambeth Council, Jonathan Bartley.  Support and funding  During the 'International Rebellion', which started on 15 April 2019, actions and messages of support arrived from various sources, including a speech by actress Emma Thompson, a planned visit by school strike leader Greta Thunberg, and statements from former NASA scientist James Hansen and linguist and activist Noam Chomsky. A study conducted during the first two days of the mid- April London occupation found that 46% of respondents supported the rebellion; however, a larger opinion poll later found that support had declined and that 54% of respondents now strongly or somewhat opposed actions aiming to \\"shut down London\\" as the protests on 17 April blocked access to means of transport including buses, alienating travellers. In May 2019, Roger Hallam and eight others stood as candidates in the European Parliament elections in the London and the South West England constituencies as Climate Emergency Independents.Matthew Taylor, \\"Extinction Rebellion protesters to stand in European elections\\", The Guardian, 26 April 2019 Between them, they won 7,416 out of the 3,917,854 total votes cast in the two constituencies.European election 2019 ‚Äì London-wide results, Lewisham CouncilResults of European Parliamentary Election 2019 ‚Äì South West Region, Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council In June 2019, 1,000 healthcare professionals in the UK and elsewhere, including professors, public health figures, and former presidents of royal colleges, called for widespread non-violent civil disobedience in response to \\"woefully inadequate\\" government policies on the unfolding ecological emergency. They called on politicians and the news media to face the facts of the unfolding ecological emergency and take action. They supported the school strike movement and Extinction Rebellion. In July 2019 Trevor Neilson, Rory Kennedy and Aileen Getty launched the Climate Emergency Fund (CEF), inspired by Greta Thunberg and Extinction Rebellion protesters in the UK in April. It donated almost half a million pounds to Extinction Rebellion groups in New York City and Los Angeles and school strike for climate groups in the US. In September 2019 Getty pledged $600,000 (¬£487,000) to the Fund. Christopher Hohn gave ¬£50,000 to the group and the charity he co- founded, The Children's Investment Fund Foundation, has donated more than ¬£150,000. Michael Stipe is a supporter; all profits from his debut solo single, \\"Your Capricious Soul\\", will go to Extinction Rebellion. On 6 February 2020, the environmental organization Mobilize Earth debuted Guardians of Life, the first of twelve short films that highlight the most pressing issues facing humanity and the natural world. Funds raised by the project will go to Amazon Watch and Extinction Rebellion.  Criticism = Diversity = Ben Smoke, one of the Stansted 15, writing in The Guardian, criticised XR's tactic of mass arrest. He wrote for XR to casually speak of imprisonment undermines the negative experiences of incarceration on black, Asian and minority ethnic people in the UK. He also wrote that for XR to be supporting peoples' court cases risks drawing significant \\"resources, time, money and energy\\" from the environmental movement, from the individuals involved, and which could otherwise be directed towards people most affected by climate change. Smoke instead recommended tactics that are not only the preserve of those able to afford the expense and time of arrest. He also wrote that though mass arrests may be intended to cause government to focus more on tackling climate change, it might instead cause government to increase anti-protest legislation. The critique of XR's middle class white privilege, that its mass arrest tactic does not consider that people of colour will not be treated as leniently by the system as white people, was also highlighted in an open letter from Wretched of the Earth, an environmental group that focuses on black, brown and indigenous voices, to XR. The group responded to this critique with a thank you, pointing out their solidarity and commitment to diversity of membership as well diversity in styles of engagement (for example, one does not need to volunteer for a prison term in order to be an active member of XR). Some in Extinction Rebellion have also called attention to Martin Luther King Jr. (one of XR's guiding inspirations) in this regard, noting that his call for civil disobedience to end segregation was a call directed toward all who were willing and able, regardless of race or colour. When the movement expanded to the US, a fourth demand was added to that group's list of demands: for a \\"just transition that prioritises the most vulnerable and indigenous sovereignty [and] establishes reparations and remediation led by and for black people, indigenous people, people of colour and poor communities for years of environmental injustice.\\" = Class = Karen Bell, senior lecturer in human geography and environmental justice at the University of West of England, Bristol, wrote in The Guardian that environmental groups such as Extinction Rebellion are not strongly rooted in working-class organisations and communities, which she said is a problem because building the broad-based support necessary for a radical transition to sustainability requires contributions from all strands of environmentalism, especially working class. Labour Party shadow cabinet member Lisa Nandy criticised the organisation in The Guardian in October 2019, saying \\"calls for individual action can't just be modelled on the lifestyles of middle class city dwellers\\". George Monbiot has also written in The Guardian that \\"Extinction Rebellion is too white, and too middle class.\\" The Canning town protest (above) focussed attention on class issues and led to an apology from an XR spokesman. =Timescale= According to the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, which supports XR's course of strong action and demands, the time frame being urged by XR is \\"an ambition that technically, economically and politically has absolutely no chance of being fulfilled.\\" It said that one way to go net zero by 2025 would include the scrapping of flying and 38 million petrol and diesel cars would need to be removed from the roads. Twenty-six million gas boilers would need to be disconnected in six years. The Rapid Transition Alliance and the Centre for Alternative Technology are more positive about the date specified. =Alleged extremism= A report called Extremism Rebellion by Policy Exchange, a UK-based centre-right think tank, said that Extinction Rebellion is an extremist organisation seeking the breakdown of liberal democracy and the rule of law. In 2019 the South East Counter Terrorism Unit police authority listed Extinction Rebellion, alongside neo-Nazi and Islamist terrorist groups, as a threat in a guide titled \\"Safeguarding young people and adults from ideological extremism\\", but recalled and disavowed this guide after media inquiries. =Politics and ideology= Extinction Rebellion's third demand (\\"Government must create and be led by the decisions of a Citizens‚Äô Assembly on climate and ecological justice\\") has been summarised by its leadership as a demand to \\"go beyond politics\\". This demand has been criticised by socialists, including individuals who have participated in the movement's action. Writing for The Independent in April 2019, Natasha Josette, an anti-racist activist and member of Labour for a Green New Deal, critiqued Extinction Rebellion both for marginalising ethnic minorities, and for not recognising \\"that the climate crisis is the result of neoliberal capitalism, and a global system of extraction, dispossession and oppression\\". Also writing for The Independent, Amardeep Dhillon argued that XR's narrow focus on net zero carbon emissions meant that it ignored extractivism and the threat to the environment posed by companies in the extractive sector using greenwashing to defend and advance their economic interests, suggesting that XR's position \\"threatens to give carte blanche to governments and corporations who are happy to shift the burden of climate destruction onto poor and indigenous communities of colour in the global South\\". In October 2019, Erica Eisen, an XR participant, wrote an article for Current Affairs in which she linked the movement's \\"beyond politics\\" slogan not only to the demand for a citizens' assembly but also to a refusal to take stances on issues beyond the environment, in order to gain as broad a base of support as possible, highlighting the movement's ban on organising community groups based on political identity. She argued that \\"...our current economic system is (not) compatible with continued life on this planet. It is unrealistic and irresponsible to pretend that a proposed climate solution which keeps capitalism intact is any kind of solution at all\\", and that failing to articulate an anti-capitalist position undermined the movement's credibility by \\"lend(ing) tacit support\\" to large companies responsible for environmentally destructive behaviour. She also suggested that failing to embrace leftist positions would give space for far right groups to piggyback and exploit environmentalist rhetoric, citing the examples of the Christchurch mosque shootings and 2019 El Paso shooting, both of whose perpetrators left manifestos which mentioned environmental concerns. Writing for i-D in December 2019, Nathalie Olah drew parallels between XR and earlier decentralised protest movements such as the events of May 68 in France and the Occupy movement, suggesting that a shared lack of clarity in concrete demands had stunted the political impact of the latter two movements and arguing that climate change and class politics were \\"inextricable\\" as \\"a small minority are responsible for a high proportion of emissions, and because the poorest stand to face the worst repercussions\\". Media coverage Analysis of the October 2019 \\"International Rebellion\\" indicates that \\"the movement was mentioned more than 70,000 times in online media reports. Of these, 43.5% of online coverage was in the UK followed by 15.2% from Germany, 14.6 % in Australia and 12.1% in the US.\\"  Bibliography  * This Is Not a Drill: An Extinction Rebellion Handbook.

Macnamara was born at Dublin in June 1893 to Richard and Mary Macnamara, with Richard being a prominent solicitor. He was one of six children. He was sent to England for his education, where he attended The Oratory School, one of England's leading Catholic schools. From there, he went up to New College, Oxford. He played cricket for his college, but was not selected to represent Oxford University Cricket Club. He did however play football for Oxford University, which earned him a half blue. During the summer break, Macnamara would return to Ireland, where he played club cricket for Leinster. He made one appearance in first-class cricket for Ireland against Scotland at Edinburgh in 1913. Batting twice in the match, Macnamara scored 30 runs in Ireland's first-innings, before being dismissed by Lovat Fraser, while in their second-innings he ended unbeaten on 24. He also bowled 13 wicket-less overs across both Scotland innings. He graduated from New College in 1914, with a fourth-class degree in history. Macnamara served in the British Army during World War I, enlisting with the Royal Dublin Fusiliers as a Second Lieutenant (on probation) in August 1915. He had some previous military experience when he was a member of the Officers' Training Corps at Oxford University. He was confirmed in the rank of Second Lieutenant in April 1916. He was killed in action during the Battle of the Somme on 18 August 1916, while defending a salient near Loos-en-Gohelle. He is buried at the Philisophe British Cemetery at Mazingarbe.

Methven was a member of the Society's Special Appeals Committee, which was involved in producing a national petition for women's suffrage to be presented as part of the Parliamentary Franchise (Extension to Women) Bill in May 1896. There were 257,796 signatures on the petition by the time it was submitted, including more than 50,000 signatories from Scotland.

A late 1940s travelogue notes that merchants kept bowls of dice at their stalls to engage in gambling with their customers when ‚Äúhousewives would routinely bet on the days their horoscope was fortunate\\", which means that on slightly more than fifty percent of such occasions they return home empty-handed and with the housekeeping money gone.\\"  Crackdown  Until the late 20th Century, the only legal gambling option was the lottery. In an effort the combat illegal gambling, the government slowly began to legalize gambling, while cracking down on major illegal gambling rings. In March 2018, the government shut down a $420 million gambling ring that implicated two senior government officials and some 90 others (including government officials). In September 2018, leader of an illegal online sports betting ring was sentenced to nine years in jail; the operation was worth some US $26 million. A separate online gambling ring shut down in 2017 was thought to be worth US $89 million. Xinhua reported a rash of pawn shops popping up during the 2018 World Cup, whose only purpose was to serve local gamblers. The black market gambling sector is estimated to be worth billions of dollars.  Legalization  The country legalized local games of chance in 2017. The country has eight casinos open for foreign passport holders, with investors seeking to open up the larger domestic customer base. As part of a three year experiment, locals are permitted to enter casinos if they can show monthly income exceeding 10 million dong (US$449) and are charged a 1 million dong entry tax. The country announced plans in 2017 to legalize sports betting. On June 14, 2018, the National Assembly passed a bill legalizing sports betting, with government oversight. This followed a 2017 decree that legalized betting on international football games, horse races and greyhound racing. Players must be at least 21 years of age, with the minimum bet set at 1000 dong and a maximum of one million dong per day. Players wishing to enter a casino must also be at least 21 years old, have the permission from their family to do so and not have a criminal record. Casinos The largest hotel-casino in Vietnam as of 2017 was the Grand- Ho Tram. It is controlled by Philip Falcone and opened in 2013. The US$1 billion building has a 550 room hotel, a Greg Norman-designed golf course and second hotel tower under construction as of 2017. Foreign investors are required to invest over $2 billion to qualify for casino licenses. In 2018, construction began along a three-kilometer (2-mile) stretch of coastline in central Vietnam where the country‚Äôs biggest casino is set to open. Suncity Group Holdings Ltd of Macau invested $4 billion in the Hoiana project that covers almost and includes shops, restaurants, golf courses and water parks. The casino will be owned by SunCity. VinaCapital, a Vietnamese investment management and real estate firm, and the Hong Kong-based VMS Investment Group will also hold similar ownership stakes in the project. Two other casinos were under construction in 2018, one in Van Don in the northern province of Quang Ninh, and one on Phu Quoc island. These are part of the pilot project to allow locals to enter casinos. The Van Don is scheduled to open in 2019 and will be managed by SunCity.

Early life Boje Postel was born on 8 April 1890 in Hemme in the rural west of Schleswig-Holstein in the north of Germany. He was the son of a farmer. Professional life At the age of 14 he discovered his love for the arts after he had seen paintings by Edouard Manet and Max Liebermann. At this age he started spending his time in the countryside painting and drawing. When he finished school in 1908, he left the countryside to go to Hamburg to study with various painters including Arthur Siebelist. He then moved onto Berlin and undertook private studies with Wilhelm Mueller-Schoenfeld. He was also taught by Martin Brandenburg and Lovis Corinth. He then met Max Liebermann. Postel was very much influenced by Liebermann‚Äôs art and the surrounding artist movement, the Berlin Secession. Postel was able to exhibit his work within this movement first in 1912 in Berlin. He was drafted by the German military before the 1st World War and sustained tuberculosis. It took him quite a bit of time to recover from that disease. Beginning in 1922, Postel travelled extensively to England, Spain the Netherlands, Italy and France. He received further influences from Fauvism and Cubism. Both influences lead to a step-by- step move away from impressionist art. In 1924 Postel settled in London but still had a room in Berlin. In 1927 he had a room in Nr 213 Kurfuerstendamm in Berlin. After 1933 Postel‚Äôs mentor Max Liebermann fell in disgrace with the National Socialist regime and resigned as president of the Prussian Academy of Arts in 1932. Postel left Germany and spent the following years with travel to the Netherlands, Majorca and Maribor in present-day Slovenia. The fate of German artists in exile during the years 1933-1945 has been described in detail elsewhere. Later life In l936, Postel and his wife Nina went into exile and settled in London. Postel made a living with teaching and freelance painting. He spent the years between 1941 and 1944 in an internment camp for Germans in exile on the Isle of Man. Owing to the relatively benign conditions there, Postel was able to continue drawing and painting, both landscapes and portrait work. A number of his portraits from this period have survived although many of the sitters remain unknown to the present day. Back in London in 1944 he continued his teaching as well as freelance painting to make a living. This continued in the post war years. Postel‚Äôs first wife died in 1960. The following years saw him alternating between Germany and Britain. He had a number of exhibitions in Germany, France and the U.K. In 1972, he married his second wife Marjorie in Surrey. Boje Postel died on 6 January 1980 in Purley, Surrey. Work Boje Postel‚Äôs work focuses on portraits as well as nature and scenes from city life. Most of his works are drawings in black and white and portraits. A good example, a print of a portrait drawing of German journalist Maximilian Harden, is in the Harvard Art Collection. There are also quite a few water colours. References *Kuester, Bernd. Boje Postel. 1890 - 1980. Ein Impressionist in der Emigration.

Biography  thumb leftthumb Burial place of Igor S. Tashlykov is the honorary lot No. 114 of the columbarium of the Eastern cemetery in Minsk. He was born in the DPRK (North Korea) in a family of military personnel. His father, Serafim Dmitrievich Tashlykov (1915, Kizilyurt, Dagestan - 1989, Minsk, Belarus) was a pilot, colonel, participant of the Great Patriotic War (WWII), mother, Nina Semenovna Tashlykova (born Shalygina) (1918, Krasnoyarsk Region - 1976, Minsk, Belarus) was a nurse, a participant of the Great Patriotic War. Since 1952 he had lived in Babruysk. He moved to Minsk with his parents in 1962. He finished secondary school No. 27 in Minsk in 1964 with a silver medal and entered the Physics Faculty of Belarusian State University (BSU). Since that time his life had been connected with the BSU for 25 years. In 1969, he graduated with honors from the Physics Faculty with a specialization in solid state physics and entered full-time postgraduate study at the Department of Solid State Physics. In 1970, he transferred to correspondence postgraduate study and worked as a junior researcher in the laboratory of experimental physics and physical electronics of the BSU. In 1971, he was transferred to the position of junior researcher in the laboratory of elionics of the Research Institute of Applied Physical Problems (APP) of BSU. From 1972 to 1989 he was Senior Researcher of the Laboratory of Elionics of the Research Institute of APP of BSU. In 1973, he was awarded the scientific degree of Candidate of Physical and Mathematical Sciences on the results of his thesis defense on the topic \\"Investigation of radiation effects in bismuth and its alloys\\" at the BSU (September 25, 1973). In 1976, he was awarded the title of Senior Research Fellow with speciality \\"Solid State Physics\\". Doctoral thesis in physics and mathematics on the subject \\"Modification and study of structure in crystals with different types of bonds (Si, GaAs, Ni) by nuclear physical methods\\" was defended in the Kharkov State University on March 17, 1989. After defending his doctoral thesis in 1989, he was invited to work as a professor at the Department of Physics at the Belarusian Institute of Technology, later renamed into the Belarusian Technological University, where he had been working for 14 years, till 2003. He was awarded the academic title of Professor in the Department of Physics in 1992. In 2003, at the invitation of the rector of the Maxim Tank Belarusian State Pedagogical University named (BSPU), Kukharchik Petr Dmitrievich, he went to work as the Dean of the Physical Faculty at the BSPU. Since 2007 he had been Head of the Department of Experimental Physics, from 2013 to 2016 - Professor of the Department of Physics and Methods of Teaching Physics of the BSPU named after M. Tank. June 7, 2016, died of stroke in Minsk. He was buried in the honorary lot No. 114 of the columbarium of the Eastern (Moscow) cemetery in Minsk.  Scientific Activity  Generally, research work of Igor S. Tashlykov was focused on the modification of the structure and properties of solids using ion-beam and ion-plasma methods and technologies, including the study of physical and chemical processes occurring during the interaction of accelerated ions with elastomers, as well as the formation of thin film (coating) / substrate systems. Scientific interests: radiation physics of solids; ion-beam modification of the surface properties of metals, semiconductors, elastomers; nuclear physical methods of research of elemental composition; applications of nuclear physical methods for modifying the properties of materials; scanning probe microscopy; properties and mechanisms of wetting the surface; thin films of electrical contacts and absorbing layers of solar cells and elements of optoelectronics. = Postgraduate studies = Tashlykov began his scientific work on the study of radiation defects in bismuth and its alloys in postgraduate course in 1969 under the guidance of Associate Professors Georgy Alexandrovich Humansky and Valery Ivanovich Prokoshin. Since the sources of radiation exposure in Belarus were not available in those years (the linear electron accelerator was used only for medicine in the oncology center) or not applicable (neutrons in the reactor channel were lost at elevated temperature), then with the help of the management of the Belarusian State University an agreement was reached to irradiate samples at the Physical Institute of Academy of Sciences (PIAS) of the USSR and the Institute for Nuclear Research of the Academy of Sciences of the Ukrainian SSR. Experiments on electron irradiation of bismuth alloys were carried out on a microtron in the laboratory of Academician P.A. Cherenkov (PIAS USSR), and on proton irradiation - in Kiev, on a U-120 cyclotron in the laboratory of the director of the Institute of Academician of the Academy of Sciences of Ukraine M.V. Pasechnik (Institute for Nuclear Research, Academy of Sciences of the Ukrainian SSR). As a result of successful work Tashlykov was recommended for a one-year internship at the Department of Ionometry of Jena University named after F. Schiller (GDR, 1971-1972). The latter largely determined his scientific interests. New methods for studying structure and composition were mastered: protonography and ionometry, later called spectroscopy of Rutherford backscattering (RBS) ions in combination with their channeling. At the general seminar in Moscow under the guidance of Professor O. B. Firsov it was noted that Tashlykov was the first among Soviet scientists who held the years experiments in 1971-1972 using ion channeling for layer-by- layer analysis of radiation damages in single crystals. The obtained results were the basis for development, together with the scientist from the Research Institute of Nuclear Physics of Moscow State University, M.A. Kumakhov, of the original method of calculating the concentration of radiation defects in irradiated single crystals, using the method of ionometry, taking into account the multiple scattering of channeled helium ions. This work was discussed at seminars at the PIAS and the Research Institute of Nuclear Physics of Moscow State University and was published in the articles in the journal ‚ÄúReports of the USSR Academy of Sciences, 217 (1974) 1277-1280‚Äù on the recommendation of Academician P.A. Cherenkov and the journal ‚ÄúReports of the Academy of Sciences of the BSSR, XVII (1973) 797-800‚Äù on the recommendation of Academician of AS BSSR A.N. Sevchenko. On September 25, 1973 Tashlykov defended his Ph.D. thesis on \\"The study of radiation effects in bismuth and its alloys\\" in the BSU. = Work at the A.N. Sevchenko Scientific Research Institute of APP of Belarusian State University = Accelerator ESU-2 in the A.N. Sevchenko Scientific Research Institute of the APP of BSU. Igor Tashlykov, Evgeny Kotov and Alexander Liseenko, Minsk, 1983 As a scientist, I.S. Tashlykov grew up in the A.N. Sevchenko Scientific Research Institute of APP of BSU. Carrying out the study of radiation disturbances in bismuth and its alloys by nuclear physical methods, Tashlykov initiated the creation of a research complex of nuclear physical methods on the basis of the ESU-2 electrostatic accelerator of horizontal type in the Belarusian State University in 1975-1979. This legendary accelerator number 2, built shortly after the Great Patriotic war in the laboratories of Kharkov Institute of Physics and Technology, was used in the 60s and 70s as an electron accelerator at PIAS in the sector of Professor V.S. Vavilov. With the assistance of the director of the Research Institute of the APP, Academician of the Academy of Sciences of Belarus, A.N. Sevchenko, head of the semiconductor laboratory Academician B.M. Vul passed this accelerator to Belarus. International Conference: Ion Beam Modification of Materials (IBM-78). First on the right John Davies, second - Larry Hou and others, Budapest, Hungary, autumn 1978 Organization of a new research center based on ESU-2, the reconstruction of the accelerator (the creation of a high- frequency ion source and its control systems), the logistic support (transmission of a target chamber equipped with a two-axis precision goniometer) of the elionics laboratory was greatly assisted by well-known specialists: L.I. Pivovar (KPTI), G.M. Osetinsky and I.A. Chepurchenko from the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (Dubna), as well as Tashlykov's colleague and friend Dr. Hardwig Treff of the University of Jena (Friedrich Schiller Jena University, Jena, GDR). From the beginning of the 70s research work began in the BSU under the guidance of Associate Professor G.A. Gumansky on the tasks of the State Committee on Science and Technology of the Council of Ministers of the USSR in a new direction associated with ion-beam synthesis of double and triple connections of optoelectronics materials. The importance and relevance of the research in this direction has led to active international cooperation. In 1971-1972, 1973, 1975, 1977 Tashlykov repeatedly carried out research at the University of Jena (Friedrich Schiller Jena University, Jena, GDR), at the invitation of the heads of the ionometric department Gustav Schirmer and Gerhard Goetz. In 1977, at the International Conference on Atomic Collisions in Solids (ICACS) at the Moscow State University, organized by Professor A.F. Tulin, Tashlykov became acquainted with Professor John A. DaviesRemembering Dr. John A. Davies // McMaster University [–≠–ª–µ–∫—Ç—Ä–æ–Ω. —Ä–µ—Å—É—Ä—Å] from the Chalk River Nuclear Laboratories, known as one of the fathers of ion implantation, and Professor George Carter of Salford University (Salford University, Manchester, UK), a famous theoretician in the field of ion implantation. John A. Davies‚Äô family ‚Äì son John, wife Florence, daughter Anne ‚Äì and Igor Tashlykov, Deep River, Canada, January 1980 At the invitation of Professor John A. Davis in 1979-1980 Tashlykov underwent traineeship at the McMaster University (McMaster University, Hamilton, Canada) and in the Chalk River Nuclear Laboratories in Canada. Defect formation in gallium arsenide was studied during implantation of N, Al, P, As, and Sb ions under conditions of controlled energy density released in cascades of atomic collisions at temperatures from 40 K to several hundred degrees Celsius with ion current density from hundredths to units of ŒºA / cm2. Using the Rutherford backscattering (RBS), the distribution profiles of the implanted As, Sb were established using the 27Al (p,Œ≥)28Si resonance nuclear reaction of aluminum profiles in gallium arsenide. These results, as well as the results of studies of the modification of the catalytic properties of nickel electrodes for water alkaline electrolysis for the production of hydrogen, formed the basis for a doctoral dissertation. New knowledge was obtained about the mechanisms of formation of radiation damage and phase reconstruction of the structure in gallium arsenide under ion irradiation, the influence of ion current density on these processes, the energy density released in the cascade of atomic collisions, the type of ions, and the irradiation temperature. Conference ACS-1979. Igor Tashlykov, John Davies and Muradyn Kumakhov, Hamilton, Canada, August 1979 The results of the studies in Canada of ion implantation into electrodes used in alkali electrolysis for the production of hydrogen and oxygen were reported by Tashlykov at the Institute of Atomic Energy named after I.V. Kurchatov. With the support of the Deputy Director of the Institute, the head of the All-Union Hydrogen Program, Academician V.A. Legasov, State Committee for Science and Technology of the Council of Ministers of the USSR provided financing in the early 80s for the beginning of planned research in the USSR on the topic \\"Development of technical regulations for ion implantation of metal catalysts and other ions in order to create corrosion-resistant electrodes used in the electrolysis of water.\\" This work was an important stage in the scientific career of Tashlykov. Five copyright certificates were obtained from the found technical solutions for creating active and corrosion-resistant electrodes. VI Seminar on rapid analysis methods. E.T. Shipatov, V.

Research of the coatings based on metals (Ti, Cr, Mo, W, etc.) on silicon, graphite, steel, aluminum and its alloys, elastomers, with simultaneous irradiation of ions of the same metals was carried out with controlling the energy density released in the cascade of atomic collisions. Mechanisms of damage and interpenetration of components in the area of coating / substrate phase separation induced by radiation was established, strength, corrosion, adhesion, friction characteristics of materials modified by coating were studied. Patents of the Russian Federation (1994, 1995) and the Republic of Belarus (1996, 1998) have been received. Using the patented method, in frames of SSTP \\"New materials and surface protection\\" he introduced the new technology at the enterprises of the Republic of Belarus (Baranovichi Automobile Aggregate Plant, OJSC Belarusrezinotechnika, Babruysk), which resulted in creation of corrosion-resistant, inertial to the elastomer adhesion mold surface for manufacturing of rubber products. Developing methods for modifying the surface of solids by atomic mixing and ion-assisted deposition of coatings, Tashlykov continued his cooperation with scientists from Heidelberg, Jena Universities, Germany, Salford University, the United Kingdom, and Institute of Nuclear Physics named after M.Planck on grants from the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD, 1991-1992, 1996, 2002) and the Royal Society (1996).

The identification of a number of mechanisms of mass transfer in thin metal film / silicon substrate systems, formed by physical vacuum deposition under conditions of hyper-high-speed crystallization, has been performed. The mechanisms of diffusion and mass transfer in the film / substrate structure were established depending on the energy density released in cascades of atomic collisions and the integral flux of xenon ions irradiating the substrate. Under his leadership, a phenomenological model of the surface wettability of nanosized films with distilled water has been developed as an effective method for studying the characteristics of surfaces and the processes occurring on them.  Main scientific results  He was the first Soviet scientist who used the channeling effect to study radiation defects in ion-implanted crystals. Based on the solution of the analytical equation, he developed a method for constructing profiles of radiation defects in crystals, which takes into account de-channeling of analyzing ions not only on defects, but also on thermal vibrations of atoms and their electrons. * The fundamentals of the technology of ion-beam synthesis of layers of solid solutions based on single- and multi-component systems of materials of solid- state electronics: silicon, silicon carbide (SiC), and ternary compounds based on gallium arsenide (AlxGa1-xAs, GaAs1-xPx) have been developed. * Mechanisms of defect formation (homogeneous, heterogeneous) and structural-phase rearrangements in semiconductor crystals during ion implantation have been established. * The following criteria were experimentally determined: the density of the released energy in cascades of atomic collisions, the ion current density, the ion energy values, the temperature implantation and annealing modes affecting the concentration, depth distribution, type of radiation defects in the near-surface layers of ion implanted semiconductors. * The developed regulations for ion-beam synthesis and doping of semiconductor crystals have been introduced at the enterprises of the Ministry of Electronics (1987, PO box A-1067, A-1561) and radio industry of the USSR (1988, PO box B-8574) with an economic effect from above 640 thousand soviet rubles. * The only complex in Belarus of nuclear physical methods for studying of solids was created with F.F. Komarov in the Research Institute of the APP BSU. * The scientific and technical materials \\"Application of ion beams for the analysis of solids\\" have been developed and implemented at the enterprises of the Ministry of Medium Engineering (1986, Institute of Atomic Energy named after I. Kurchatov, PO box P-6710) with an economic effect of over 40 thousand soviet rubles. * The complex of studies on ion-beam modification of electrode materials (Ni, Ti, graphite) used for the electrolysis of alkaline, acidic and other solutions was carried out according to the task of the State Committee for Science and Technology of the Council of Ministers of the USSR. The regulations for the creation by implantation of Ag+ ions in Ni of catalytically active and corrosion-resistant anodes for water-alkaline electrolysis of water were developed and handed over to the Ministry of Chemical Industry and the USSR Academy of Sciences organizations, the application of which provided a 10% reduction in electricity costs per unit of output. The economic effect was 180 thousand rubles. * Fundamental results have been obtained on the mechanisms and dynamics of radiation defect formation in metal crystals during ion implantation, and a model for oxidizing the anode surface in aqueous alkaline electrolysis has been constructed. * A theory of ion-assisted protective coatings of rubber has been developed, which takes into account the capture of auxiliary gas atoms, surface spraying, the density of ionized and deposited neutral fractions generated by the ion source. * The \\"Method of deposition of coatings\\" has been experimentally proved and patented. Using this method, the new technology of ion-assisted deposition of coatings has been developed and introduced at the enterprises of Belarus (Baranovichi Automobile Units Plant, Belavtomaz Production Association (2001), JSC Belorussian Rubber Plant (2000) assisted coating application in self-irradiation conditions on cuffs for use in the rear axle assemblies of GAZ-3102, GAZ-3110 cars and MAZ car dampers. The economic effect in 2000 amounted to 1,015,000 thousand belarusian rubles. * Technological regimes for the formation of superhard nanosized films on silicon substrates for functional elements of nano- and microelectronics have been developed. The studied radiation-controlled processes of mass transfer during the deposition of thin films allow controlling adhesion at the atomic level, as well as modifying the surface properties of the absorbing layers and back contacts for solar cells. * A vacuum method for the production of chalcogenide semiconductors Pb1-xSnx (S, Te) has been developed, and regularities have been established for the variation of their electro-physical and optical properties and structural characteristics, depending on the composition and processing conditions of production, the practical applications of these materials in the field of optoelectronics as thin-film solar cells and photo converters, have been determined.  Pedagogical activity  Tashlykov paid much attention to the training of scientific and pedagogical specialists, forming their interest in science from the student years. The monograph \\"Non-destructive Analysis of Solids Surfaces by Ion Beams\\", published in the ‚ÄúUniversitetskoye‚Äù publishing house, is used as a textbook for reading special courses at the Departments of Semiconductor Physics and Solid State Physics at the BSU. The developed method of resonance nuclear reactions for layer analysis of light impurities was used in a laboratory workshop on the \\"Backscattering method and nuclear reactions in elemental analysis of substance\\" for the training of students at the Kharkiv State University, as well as in similar works at the D.V. Scobeltsyn Research Institute of Nuclear Physics of Moscow State University, at the Research Institute of Physics of Rostov State University. A student research laboratory \\"PHYSMATING\\" fruitfully worked under his scientific guidance at the Physics and Mathematics Faculty of the BSPU named after M. Tank.

The key objective of a multiprocessor is to boost a system's execution speed. The other objectives are fault tolerance and application matching. The term \\"multiprocessor\\" can be confused with the term \\"multiprocessing\\". While multiprocessing is a type of processing in which two or more processors work together to execute multiple programs simultaneously, multiprocessor refers to a hardware architecture that allows multiprocessing. Multiprocessor systems are classified according to how processor memory access is handled and whether system processors are of a single type or various ones.  Multiprocessor system types  There are many types of multiprocessor systems: * Loosely coupled multiprocessor system * Tightly coupled multiprocessor system * Homogeneous multiprocessor system * Heterogeneous multiprocessor system * Shared memory multiprocessor system * Distributed memory multiprocessor system * Uniform memory access (UMA) system * cc‚ÄìNUMA system * Hybrid system ‚Äì shared system memory for global data and local memory for local data  Loosely-coupled (distributed memory) multiprocessor system  Loosely Coupled Multiprocessor System In loosely- coupled multiprocessor systems, each processor has its own local memory, input/output (I/O) channels, and operating system. Processors exchange data over a high-speed communication network by sending messages via a technique known as \\"message passing\\". Loosely-coupled multiprocessor systems are also known as distributed-memory systems, as the processors do not share physical memory and have individual I/O channels. = System characteristics = * These systems are able to perform multiple-instructions-on-multiple-data (MIMD) programming. * This type of architecture allows parallel processing. * The distributed memory is highly scalable.  Tightly-coupled (shared memory) multiprocessor system  Multiprocessor system with a shared memory closely connected to the processors. A symmetric multiprocessing system is a system with centralized shared memory called main memory (MM) operating under a single operating system with two or more homogeneous processors. There are two types of systems: * Uniform memory-access (UMA) system * NUMA system = Uniform memory access (UMA) system = * Heterogeneous multiprocessing system * Symmetric multiprocessing system (SMP)  Heterogeneous multiprocessor system  A heterogeneous multiprocessing system contains multiple, but not homogeneous, processing units ‚Äì central processing units (CPUs), graphics processing units (GPUs), digital signal processors (DSPs), or any type of application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). The system architecture allows any accelerator ‚Äì for instance, a graphics processor ‚Äì to operate at the same processing level as the system's CPU.  Symmetric multiprocessor system  Symmetric multiprocessing system Systems operating under a single OS (operating system) with two or more homogeneous processors and with a centralized shared main memory. A symmetric multiprocessor system (SMP) is a system with a pool of homogeneous processors running under a single OS with a centralized, shared main memory. Each processor, executing different programs and working on different sets of data, has the ability to share common resources (memory, I/O device, interrupt system, and so on) that are connected using a system bus, a crossbar, or a mix of the two, or an address bus and data crossbar. Each processor has its own cache memory that acts as a bridge between the processor and main memory. The function of the cache is to alleviate the need for main-memory data access, thus reducing system-bus traffic. Use of shared memory allows for a uniform memory-access time (UMA). = cc-NUMA system = cc-NUMA System cc-NUMA Remote Memory Read It is known that the SMP system has limited scalability. To overcome this limitation, the architecture called \\"cc-NUMA\\" (cache coherency‚Äìnon-uniform memory access) is normally used. The main characteristic of a cc-NUMA system is having shared global memory that is distributed to each node, although the effective \\"access\\" a processor has to the memory of a remote component subsystem, or \\"node\\", is slower compared to local memory access, which is why the memory access is \\"non-uniform\\". A cc‚ÄìNUMA system is a cluster of SMP systems ‚Äì each called a \\"node\\", which can have a single processor, a multi-core processor, or a mix of the two, of one or other kinds of architecture ‚Äì connected via a high-speed \\"connection network\\" that can be a \\"link\\" that can be a single or double-reverse ring, or multi-ring, point-to-point connections,AMD Opteron Shared Memory MP Systems ‚Äì http://www.cse.wustl.edu/~roger/569M.s09/28_AMD_Hammer_MP_HC_v8.pdfAn Introduction to the Intel¬Æ QuickPath Interconnect ‚Äì http://www.intel.ie/content/dam/doc/white-paper/quick-path-interconnect- introduction-paper.pdf or a mix of these (e.g. IBM Power Systems), bus interconnection (e.g. NUMAqSourceForge ‚Äì http://lse.sourceforge.net/numa/faq/system_descriptions.html), \\"crossbar\\", \\"segmented bus\\" (NUMA Bull HN ISI ex Honeywell,Bull HN F. Zulian ‚Äì A. Zulian patent ‚Äì Computer system with a bus having a segmented structure ‚Äì http://www.freepatentsonline.com/6314484.html) \\"mesh router\\", etc. cc-NUMA is also called \\"distributed shared memory\\" (DSM) architecture NUMA Architecture ‚Äì http://www.dba-oracle.com/real_application_clusters_rac_grid/numa.html. The difference in access times between local and remote memory can be also an order of magnitude, depending on the kind of connection network used (faster in segmented bus, crossbar, and point-to-point interconnection; slower in serial rings connection).  Examples of interconnection  Double-reverse ring Segmented Bus Crossbar To overcome this limit, a large remote cache (see Remote cache) is normally used. With this solution, the cc-NUMA system becomes very close to a large SMP system.  Tightly-coupled versus loosely-coupled architecture  Both architectures have trade-offs which may be summarized as follows: * Loosely-coupled architectures feature high performances of each individual processor but do not enable for easy real-time balancing of the load among processors. * Tightly-coupled architectures feature easy load- balancing and distribution among processors but suffer from the bottleneck consisting in the sharing of common resources through one or more buses.  Multiprocessor system featuring global data multiplication  An intermediate approach, between those of the two previous architectures, is having common resources and local resources, such as local memories (LM), in each processor. The common resources are accessible from all processors via the system bus, while local resources are only accessible to the local processor. Cache memories can be viewed in this perspective as local memories. This system (patented by F. Zulian ), used on the DPX/2 300 Unix based system (Bull Hn Information Systems Italia (ex Honeywell)), is a mix of tightly and loosely coupled systems and makes use of all the advancements of these two architectures. The local memory is divided into two sectors, global data (GD) and local data (LD). The basic concept of this architecture is to have global data, which is modifiable information, accessible by all processors. This information is duplicated and stored in each local memory of each processor. Each time the global data is modified in a local memory, a hardware write- broadcasting is sent to the system bus to all other local memories to maintain the global data coherency. Thus, global data may be read by each processor accessing its own local memory without involving the system bus. System bus access is only required when global data is modified in a local memory to update the copy of this data stored in the other local memories. Local data can be exchanged in a loosely coupled system via message-passing Multiprocessor System Featuring Global Data Multiplication Multiprocessor System Featuring Global Data Multiplation - Global Data Write-Broadcasting  References  Parallel computing Classes of computers ","title":"Multiprocessor system architecture"},{"id":"58955280","title":"Dance and Cry"},{"id":"58955291","text":"Schrum-Schrum or Alte Jungfer (\\"Old Maid\\") is a simple, domino-like, card game from Germany which is suitable for children.  Rules  The following rules are based on Feder. = Cards = Schrum-Schrum may be played with a Piquet or Skat pack of 32 cards ranking, from highest to lowest: King, Queen, Jack, Ten, Nine Eight, Seven, Ace. = Aim = To be the first to shed all one's cards. = Play = The cards are shuffled well and fully dealt. Players do not look at their cards but place them face down in front of them as an individual talon. Forehand leads and turns his topmost card. If it is an Ace it is played to the centre of the table. Any other card is placed face up beside his talon in a reserve, the top card of which is always available. The next player in clockwise order either builds a Seven of any suit onto the Ace if he has one or, if not, starts his reserve pile. Cards are built on the Ace in ascending sequence to the King, their suit being irrelevant. Every time a player is able to add to the sequence, he may turn another card and keep going. As a sneaky alternative to placing a card on the reserve, players may also place it on an opponent's reserve if it matches in rank (variation: if it is the next in sequence). If he does so, he may turn the next card of his talon and play that. Once a player's talon is exhausted, he turns his reserve and re-uses it. = Winning = The first player to shed all his cards is the winner.  Alte Jungfer  G√∂√∂ck, Roland and M√ºller describe a similar game for 3 or more players called Alte Jungfer (\\"Old Maid\\" - not to be confused with the English game of Old Maid) using a 52-card pack. After shuffling and cutting the dealer distributes all the cards, it being irrelevant if some players have an extra one. The mode of play is similar to Schrum-Schrum: the first player with an Ace plays it to the table; otherwise cards are placed in the player's reserve pile. However the cards must be built, in suit as well as sequence, onto the piles started by the Aces. This time the sequence is Aces high i.e. A K Q J 10 9 8 7. Alternatively cards may be played to an opponent's reserve pile, again in suit and sequence. M√ºller adds that a player may only turn one card when it is his turn, but that any number of cards may be played off his reserve pile if they can be used to build. In addition he states that, when a player's talon is used up, rather than turning over the reserve to form a new talon, players continue playing off the reserve. The last player holding cards is the \\"old maid\\" (Alte Jungfer).  Footnotes  References  Literature  * Feder, Jan (1980). Die sch√∂nsten Kartenspiele. Knaur, Munich. * G√∂√∂ck, Roland (1967).

The CPAT is a timed test that measures how candidates handle eight separate physical tasks or functions, designed to mirror tasks that firefights would have to do on the job.  Details  During the test, candidates are required to complete 8 separate tasks in a period of 10 minutes and 20 seconds. The tasks are the following: * Stair Climb (climbing stairs while carrying an additional 25 lb. simulated hose pack) * Hose Drag (stretching uncharged hose lines, advancing lines) * Equipment Carry (removing and carrying equipment from fire apparatus to fire ground) * Ladder Raise and Extension (placing a ground ladder at the fire scene and extending the ladder to the roof or a window) * Forcible Entry (penetrating a locked door, breaching a wall) * Search (crawling through dark unpredictable areas to search for victims) * Rescue Drag (removing a victim or partner from a burning building) * Ceiling Breach and Pull (locating a fire and checking for fire extension) During the test, candidates are required wear a helmet, gloves and a 50 lb weighted vest. This is designed to simulate the weight of a firefighter's personal protective equipment. For the stair climb, candidates are required to carry and additional 25 lb weight, which simulates the carrying of a hose pack into a high rise fire. Candidates are accompanied by a test proctor, who calls out directions for the test events and scores the candidate's success. Each event of the CPAT must be completed as directed. If a candidate fails any component of the test or does not complete the test within the 10 minute and 20 second time limit, they will fail the entire test.

Lloyd's List reported on 23 May that Wildboar had detained and sent into Falmouth Gustaff, Trent, master, which had been sailing from Bordeaux.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ4355.

Fate Commander Villiers Francis Hatton was appointed to Wild Boar at the beginning of 1810 but before he could take command she was wrecked on 15 February on the Runnel Stone, Isles of Scilly. Lloyd's List reported on 20 February that Wildboar had left Falmouth on the 15th with dispatches for Lisbon.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ4434. The courtmartial of Burton and his crew took place on 23 March. It found that Wild Boar had been sailing from Falmouth to Cork and was passing between Scilly and the mainland when she struck in fine weather on the Runnelstone. She took on water so quickly most of the crew had to jump into the sea. Earl of Uxbridge fortuitously and fortunately was in sight and came to Wild Boars rescue. Even so, 12 men drowned. The court martial exonerated Burton and blamed the loss on the incompetence of the master. It also described the master's behaviour as reprehensible; when she struck he had jumped into the jolly boat and made off. The court martial ordered him dis-rated, to serve only as a seaman.

The government also announced ¬£1.5 million towards plans to reopen the Northumberland line, ¬£100,000 towards assessment of the Fleetwood branch line, and ¬£20 million for a third round of the New Stations Fund. The ¬£500 million would not be spent on building railway lines but on developing proposals through feasibility studies, business cases and designs. Proposals for projects would be sponsored by a local MP, gather local support, and then be put to a panel of experts chaired by the Rail Minister. Examples given were: * upgrading a freight line to provide passenger services and restoring stations on it * restoring track and services to an old alignment * modifying an old route which has been built over.

The book is about the philosophical differences between countries in the European Union, particularly Germany and France, and how their contrasting outlooks on political philosophy have shaped the Eurozone. The book also provides context to how the ideas that led to the creation of the European Union have influenced and been influenced by ideas in the United States, the United Kingdom, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the European Central Bank (ECB). Summary The book begins with the historical roots of German-French differences, highlighting the cultural and philosophical aspects which distinguish the two nations. Their divergent systems of philosophical thoughts have spurred differences in economic ideologies in regards to federalism versus centralism, monetary and fiscal policies, and austerity versus stimulus. The authors argue that \\"there is no single, coherent economic philosophy within Europe. Rather, different nations have retained their own distinct economic philosophers and view European-level institutions--and ways to improve them--in this light.\\" The books continus with an analysis on how these philosophies have manifested themselves in the European Union, mainly through the Maastricht negotiations and the commitment to a currency union. They expound upon the divergent ideas of economics and politics have contributed to different models of governance within Europe, and that \\"the German view and the French view actually need each other to be sustainable.\\" Critical response Ben Bernanke, former Chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve praised the book for its insightful contribution to the history of economics: \\"International divergences in economic policy are as much the result of differences in intellectual frameworks as of variation in economic circumstances.

He was born and grew up in Montreal, Canada and received a law degree from McGill University but spent most of his life in Baton Rouge, Louisiana where he was Professor of Law at Louisiana State University. Dainow was the founding editor of the Louisiana Law Review that began publishing several issues per year in 1938. He was the Chief Reporter for the Compiled Edition of the Civil Code of Louisiana, an important work published in 1940 with several updates over the years, that was the starting point for any major research into Louisiana Civil Law. During World War II, Major Joseph Dainow served in the Judge Advocate General's Corps, United States Army. In 1945 he prepared research materials for use in the Nuremberg Trials and went to Nuremberg as a member of the legal staff of the American prosecution team. Dainow was a member of the editorial board of the American Journal of Comparative Law and an active member of many national and international learned societies and organizations. He published over 300 works that are in over 1,000 libraries. Biography Joseph Dainow was born in Montreal, Quebec on July 5, 1906 to Aaron and Pearl (Sourkes) Dainow. He was the oldest of four children; Joseph, Helen, Henry and Sylvia. He grew up in the area of the city where many immigrant Jews first settled, an area that was featured in many stories written by the well-known Canadian author Mordecai Richler. He went to McGill University in Montreal, completing an undergraduate B.A. degree in 1926. He continued at McGill for a law degree which he received in 1929. In 1933 Joseph Dainow married Frieda Fineman. In 1935 they moved to Louisiana. They had two children, Jariel David and Keren Judith. Law school Gold Medal board in the McGill Law School listing the leading student for each year. Dainow applied to the McGill Law School and was accepted, in spite of the strict quotas for Jews in effect at McGill at the time.

Dainow went on to work on a PhD in law at the University of Dijon in France and in 1931 he received the degree Docteur en Droit. Law career From 1931 to 1932, Dainow was a lecturer in Roman law at McGill University. Following this he was in private law practice in Montreal, but he was a scholar and wanted to pursue an academic career of research and teaching. In 1933 he continued his studies by going to Northwestern University where he received an S.J.D. degree (Doctor of Juridical Science) in 1938. Legal systems of the world. As a scholar in the Civil Law, there were not a lot of opportunities for a university position in the U.S. and Canada. While most of Europe and the rest of the world had legal systems based on Civil Law, only Quebec and Louisiana used the Civil Law. Civil Law is based on comprehensive, continuously updated legal codes that specify all matters that can be brought before a court. The rest of the U.S. and Canada used the Common Law, which was based on the English legal system of case law where the law is based on prior judicial decisions of the courts. A number of professors at Northwestern urged Dainow to consider Louisiana, as it would provide an opportunity to fully utilize his background and training in the Civil Law. In 1935 Dainow and his wife moved to New Orleans, Louisiana and he became Professor of Law at Loyola University. In 1938 he left Loyola to become an Assistant Professor of Law at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

College Street. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Art Deco building was designed by noted Texas architect Alfred C. Finn, who touted an extensive portfolio of steel-framed skyscrapers when the People's National Bank Building was completed in 1932. Since 2014 it has been known as the People's Petroleum Building. History Local attorney and judge Samuel A. Lindsey commissioned the People's National Bank Building in 1932, amidst the Great Depression. Lindsey was also a local real estate investor and chairman of the bank. He established the People's National Company as a medium to finance the project while limiting liability to the bank and to himself. The building is located at the southwest corner of Courthouse Square in downtown Tyler. Block 9, Lot 5 was previously occupied by the two-story Goldstein and Brown mercantile store, which was damaged by a fire as early as 1930. The mercantile partners sold the property to People's National Bank in May 1931. The bank commissioned Houston architect Alfred C. Finn to design a skyscraper to replace the store, and by October, he submitted illustrations for the proposed building. A local contractor, Campbell & White, was responsible for construction, and engaged Universal Contracting of Houston to pour the foundation in April 1932. Campbell & White was the general contractor. People's National Bank Building opened on 5 November 1932 and was fully leased before the start of 1933. It was home to Tyler's most important business tenants: McMurrey Refining Company, the law firm of Pollard & Lawrence, and Ed Laster, who started a local oil boom with the development of Daisy Bradford #3. The building's owners responded to the demand for local office space by expanding the four-story wing on West Erwin street to ten stories. It remained the prime office location in Tyler through the 1950s, after which the building lost tenants and attempted to stem the tide with some expensive renovations in 1969. Nation's Bank acquired People's National Bank, then moved into its own new twenty-story building in the early 1980s. This additional office space near the square and the trend of new suburban development in south Tyler caused high vacancy rates in downtown. Tyler Towne Centre acquired the building in 1997, while preserving its appearance. Through 2001, the banking facilities lacked a tenant, but Tyler Towne Centre leased some retail and office space.Williams (2001), p. 11. According to one report, however, the building was mostly unoccupied in 2000. A new ownership group ‚Äì Garnett and Tim Brookshire, and Andy Bergfeld ‚Äì began a new renovation project in the early 2010s, replacing infrastructure, including new air conditioning, electrical, and plumbing systems. They renamed it People's Petroleum Building. Renovations of the tenth and eleventh floors created model office space to show to potential tenants. As of September 2014, the ninth and tenth floors were leased, with the eleventh floor refurbished as leasable space. Architectural characteristics At the retail level, on the College Street and Erwin sides, the facades are clad in smooth black granite with flutings. The pane glass was originally set in metal frames, but replaced with plate glass set in aluminum frames. The first floor interiors, including the lobby and the banking rooms, are mostly original, decorated in marble and limestone. The elevation is only symmetrical on its College Street side, where the facings are composed mostly of brick and offset by polished black granite.Williams (2001), p. 3.

Her own husband was away as head of the company's interests at Connimere. In 1692, Elihu Yale deposed as governor and faced enquiries, while John Nicks was arrested. Catherine Nicks retired with Yale and Hieronima de Paiva to Yale's garden house, creating a scandal. She was put on trial and fined for having sold wares from the company's godowns on Yale's private account. She was allowed to depart for England, and was joined by Yale, who brought with him her spouse and children, in 1699. The Nicks returned to Madras, where she continued as the business agent of Yale.

Design Like her sister ships, Robert Ward is designed to perform search and rescue missions, port security, and the interception of smugglers. She is armed with a remote-controlled, gyro-stabilized 25 mm autocannon, four crew served M2 Browning machine guns, and light arms. She is equipped with a stern launching ramp, that allows her to launch or retrieve a water-jet propelled high-speed auxiliary boat, without first coming to a stop. Her high-speed boat has over-the-horizon capability, and is useful for inspecting other vessels, and deploying boarding parties. Operational history * Robert Ward was damaged by Hurricane Michael as she proceeded from the Caribbean Sea to Los Angeles, California. She arrived at Los Angeles on October 31, 2018. After completing her sea trials, Robert Ward was commissioned at San Francisco, California on March 2, 2019. * On Robert Wards first operational patrol the crew saved three lives. On the morning of February 10, 2019 Robert Ward responded to an Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon distress call near Torrey Pines, California. Robert Ward arrived on scene within minutes and located three hypothermic people (two adults and one child) clinging to the hull of an overturned sail boat. The crew of Robert Ward rescued all three individuals, provided EMS and transported survivors to San Diego, California. * On August 29, 2019 Robert Ward returned to Coast Guard Base Los Angeles Long Beach from its first Eastern Pacific Patrol with of seized cocaine. The cocaine was estimated to be worth $38.5 million. Robert Ward was credited with the second largest cocaine seizure and disruption of any Coast Guard Fast Response Cutter in the fleet. * On November 13, 2019 Robert Ward assisted a mariner in distress onboard a homemade sailing vessel after a five-month journey across Pacific Ocean from Japan. The crew of Robert Ward provided food, water and various essentials supplies. Robert Ward towed the vessel to waters offshore Port Hueneme, California. The vessel was subsequently towed to the nearest safe haven by another Coast Guard vessel. * Only July 28th, 2020 Robert Ward was conducting a pursuit of a non-compliant vessel that had traveled across the U.S.-Mexico Maritime Boundary line into U.S. Territorial Waters. During the pursuit, persons on board the vessel were seen throwing bags overboard. Soon after, the vessel completely capsized sending all 14 people into the water. All 14 people were immediately recovered from the water and apprehended by Robert Ward. Robert Ward was also able to recover backpack style packages containing 82 pounds of methamphetamine. Namesake In 2010, Charles \\"Skip\\" W. Bowen, who was then the United States Coast Guard's most senior non-commissioned officer, proposed that all 58 cutters in the Sentinel class should be named after enlisted sailors in the Coast Guard, or one of its precursor services, who were recognized for their heroism. In 2015 the Coast Guard announced that Robert G. Ward would be the namesake of the 29th cutter. Ward was the coxswain in charge of a landing craft on June 6, 1944, during the Invasion of Normandy.

He fought for Edward III in the first phases of the Second War of Scottish Independence and the Hundred Years' War. Family and property Arms of Hugh Hasting: Or, a maunch gules, a label of three argent. Hugh was the second son of John Hastings, 1st Baron Hastings, by his second wife, Isabel, a daughter of Hugh Despenser, Earl of Winchester. By 18 May 1330, he was married to Margery Foliot, who was born around 1312 and was a ward in his mother's house from 1325 until their marriage. With Margery, he had two sons, John (c.1328‚Äì1393) and Hugh (died 1369), and a daughter, Maud. Margery outlived him, dying on 8 August 1349. Margery was a granddaughter of Jordan Foliot and co-heir with her younger brother Richard of the manors of Elsing and Weasenham in Norfolk and other property in Nottinghamshire and Yorkshire. It was through Margery that Hugh acquired these holdings and from his mother that he inherited the manor of Monewdon in Suffolk and a moiety of the manor of Sutton Scotney in Hampshire upon her death in December 1334. He received livery for his inheritance on 28 March 1335.Andrew Ayton (2008), \\"Hastings, Sir Hugh (c. 1310‚Äì1347), administrator and soldier\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Retrieved 3 November 2018 from http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-12577. Hugh held several manors from Henry of Grosmont, Earl of Derby. Shortly before 1342, Hugh acquired a life interest in the manor of Oswardbek in Nottinghamshire from Laurence Hastings, Earl of Pembroke, his nephew. These two earls were the principal lords under which Hugh served in the wars with France. Administrator Although he never rose to the rank of high sheriff or knight of the shire, Hugh's capabilities were appreciated by Edward III. He served regularly on commissions of oyer and terminer and was appointed justice of the peace for the West Riding of Yorkshire on 8 November 1338. Hugh was summoned to attend the Great Council that met at Westminster Abbey on 29 April 1342. He was one of only 106 laymen summoned to that council. In the mid-1340s, he served as steward of the household of Edward's queen, Philippa of Hainaut. Neither of these appointments could have been made without the approval of Edward III. In early May 1347, Hugh was appointed seneschal of Gascony and assigned a retinue of fifty men-at-arms and eighty archers for the task. He died before he could take up his new post. Soldier Hugh can be traced soldiering in Scotland every year from 1335 to 1338. In July 1338, Hugh sailed from Orwell with the king's army to Antwerp in the Duchy of Brabant. He took part in the naval campaign in the English Channel and was present at the battle of Sluys on 24 June 1340. In 1342‚Äì43, he served in the comitiva (retinue) of the Earl of Pembroke during the Breton campaign. He was serving under the Earl of Pembroke again during the Aquitanian campaign of 1345, under the ultimate leadership of the Earl of Derby. According to the French chronicler Jean Froissart, Hugh was present for Derby's victory in the battle of Auberoche on 21 October 1345. It is known, however, that the Earl of Pembroke missed the battle and so it is possible that Froissart is mistaken in placing Hugh there. Hugh appears to have returned to England before the Siege of Aiguillon, which lasted from April to August 1346 and resulted in England retaining control of the castle. The highest military post in which Hugh served was that of king's captain and lieutenant in Flanders, to which he was appointed on 20 June 1346. In his capacity as Edward's Flemish lieutenant he mounted an attack on France's northern border as a diversion during the king's invasion of Normandy in July. Hugh recruited an army from the Flemish towns and with his own retinue of 250, mostly archers, laid siege to B√©thune. His Flemish army proved undisciplined and the siege was abandoned in failure before the end of August. Hugh missed the great English victory at the battle of Cr√©cy on 26 August 1346, but with the lifting of the B√©thune siege he joined the siege of Calais, begun on 4 September, with his men-at-arms and some archers. He was still in the siege camp when he was appointed seneschal of Gascony in May 1347. Death and burial Having been appointed for service in Gascony, Hugh left the siege of Calais and returned to England. Perhaps he was already ill from conditions in the camp. He drew up his last will and testament at Old Ford in Middlesex on 22 July 1347. A week later he was dead. He was entombed in the chancel of St Mary's Church, which he had built in Elsing. His tomb was opened in September 1978. Hugh was shown to have been about 5 feet 10 inches tall at his death. He was buried wearing either a wig or a hat made of cow hair. There was evidence of injuries sustained in warfare: damaged incisors from a blow to the jaw and osteoarthritis in the shoulder and elbow. The monumental brass put up over Hugh's tomb is \\"one of the most celebrated of all English brasses\\". Hugh is portrayed as a knight in armour. Around him are smaller figures holding the coats of arms of the men Hugh had served under. Besides king and the earls of Derby and Pembroke there was the Guy de Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick.

It is located in the San Francisco building of the Philippine Center at 447 Sutter Street in central San Francisco, a couple of blocks north of Union Square. History The Philippine Consulate General in San Francisco was opened in 1946, immediately after the Philippines was granted independence by the United States, with Roberto Regala serving as the mission's first consul. The next year, it established an extension office in Los Angeles, which would later become its own mission in 1955. During the 1970s and 1980s, protesters opposed to Ferdinand Marcos regularly demonstrated outside the Consulate, and throughout his presidency the Consulate, along with other missions in the United States, was perceived as teeming with agents loyal to the Marcos regime. When Marcos was ousted in the People Power Revolution in 1986, anti-Marcos demonstrators confronted the mission's staff outside on Sutter Street, eventually taking over the Consulate entirely. It continues to be a place for anti-government demonstrations today; in 2017, demonstrators protested in front of the Consulate against Rodrigo Duterte and his second State of the Nation Address. In 2003, the Philippine government briefly contemplated selling the Consulate building, which elicited a strongly negative response from Max Soliven, founder of The Philippine Star, especially in light of the Philippine government's decision to sell during the presidency of Corazon Aquino a building facing Union Square housing the Philippine Airlines offices in San Francisco, which was sold at a significant loss. Staff and activities The Philippine Consulate General in San Francisco is headed by Consul General Henry S. Bensurto Jr. Currently, the Consulate's jurisdiction covers northern California, northern Nevada, and the states of Washington, Oregon, Montana, Colorado, Idaho, Utah, Wyoming and Alaska. The Consulate holds regular consular missions through its Consulate-on-Wheels (COW) program in major cities within its jurisdiction, including in Anchorage, Seattle, Portland, and Colorado Springs, as well as in smaller communities. COW programs are also held in communities throughout the Bay Area. The Consulate has also experimented with various ways of reaching out to Filipinos aside from providing consular services. It launched its monthly public forum, \\"Talakayan sa Konsulado\\" (\\"Forum at the Consulate\\"), on February 14, 2014, as well as a monthly \\"FAQ Friday\\" where the Consulate answers questions from the public on its Facebook page. In October 2014, community leader Rudy Asercion partnered with the Consulate to launch his national Safe Haven program, which helps provide safe spaces for children affected by bullying and violence.

Biography William King was born on December 3, 1890 in San Mateo, California, the son of Frederic Randolph King and Edith King (born Boswell). He was the grandson of minister and noted orator, Thomas Starr King. As a freshman at the University of California, King was a member of the varsity rugby team.

He held various posts in the late eighth and early ninth centuries, and played a supporting role in the events of the Fourth Fitna.  Career  Al-Abbas was a grandson of Isa ibn Musa, the nephew of the first two Abbasid caliphs as-Saffah and al-Mansur and initial heir-apparent to the latter. Shortly after the accession of Harun al-Rashid in 786 he is mentioned as serving as deputy governor of Kufa for his father Musa, and later in Harun's reign he was appointed as full governor of that same city.; .

In March 812 he participated in the failed coup of al-Husayn ibn Ali ibn Isa, in which he was responsible for personally apprehending both al-Amin and his mother Zubaydah bint Ja'far, and he was subsequently selected to lead the first pilgrimages undertaken in al-Ma'mun's name, in 812, 813 and 814.; (for 812 and 813 only); ; (in corrupted form).

The paper is run primarily by undergraduate students. Since its founding in 1949, the Justice has provided a critical perspective on Brandeis University policy and events through its articles and editorial work. The Justice is published every Tuesday and distributed throughout the Brandeis campus.  History = Founding = Brandeis was established in 1948, and members of the founding class of 107 first-year students created the Justice the following spring. The newspaper was named after the university's namesake, Justice Louis Brandeis. In its first issue, published in March 1949, Carl Werner ‚Äô52 outlined the responsibilities that the first graduating class had on its shoulders. ‚ÄúBrandeis University is depending on its teachers, but even more so it is depending on its students. If you fail, you are hurting the chances of its survival,‚Äù Werner wrote. = 20th century = In the 1950-1951 school year, as the nascent school underwent large-scale construction, the Justice documented the progress of construction crews, which, according to the Brandeis Internet and Technology Service's history of the university, appeared to be unusually slow. ‚ÄúEven the new facilities sometimes worked to challenge their resolve. In the new Ridgewood Quad broken pipes led to extended periods without heat, compounded by the swamp of ankle-deep mud between the dorms and the center of campus, dubbed by residents the ‚ÄòRidgewood Quagmire.‚Äô‚Äù The Justice was an outlet for students to voice their concerns about the school‚Äôs growing pains. As the school expanded, Brandeis president Abram L. Sachar announced plans to build a Jewish chapel in the 1952-53 school year. Earlier plans for a multi-faith chapel had been abandoned, as the administration assumed that Catholic authorities would not approve of holding services in it. The Justice‚Äôs editorial board, along with the student council and a group of concerned students, requested an alternative that would maintain Brandeis‚Äôs Jewish identity while including students from other faiths. As a result of these efforts, Sachar agreed to construct a three-chapel complex that would separate Jewish, Protestant and Catholic services. In the spring of 1967, President Lyndon B. Johnson announced plans to suspend draft deferrals for students pursuing higher education, bringing increased student attention to the Vietnam war. The Justice published articles that served to bring the alternatives to military service to light, and interviewed an imprisoned draft resister. During the 1977-78 school year, the Justice reported that Brandeis held stock in 15 companies with commercial ties to apartheid South Africa. As a result, students began pressuring the administration to divest from South Africa. Skeptical that divestment would effect any change, then-president Marver Hillel Bernstein brought the issue to the school's board of trustees, who decided to use Brandeis‚Äôs position as a stockholder to push for improvements. The New Hampshire Union Leader responded to students' protests in an editorial, writing, ‚Äúif Brandeis students had their way and succeeded in hurting South African business, Israeli business would suffer.‚Äù The Justice responded that the protests were about the immorality of apartheid ‚Äî not the Israeli companies that relied on South African companies‚Äô supply of diamonds ‚Äî and questioned why the Union Leader had singled out the student movement at Brandeis instead of similar ones at Dartmouth College, Harvard University, or Wellesley College. In 1993, the Justice ran an advertisement placed by the Committee for Open Debate on the Holocaust that questioned whether the Holocaust occurred. Its publication led to student protests, and thousands of copies of the Justice were stolen. According to coverage in The New York Times, the editors of the Justice accepted the ad \\"so readers would know that such thinking existed\\". In response to student protest and widespread criticism of the decision to run the ad, the editor in chief of the Justice, David Turner, announced that the $130 earned from the advertisement would be donated to the Holocaust museum. The editorial board of the Boston Globe subsequently rebuked the Justice for its editorial judgement and handling of the controversy, calling it \\"pathetic\\" that college journalists \\"would allow themselves to be manipulated by Holocaust revisionists\\". = Digital era = The Justice began releasing content on its website in 2001. In 2003, publication of the newspaper was delayed after an issue contained a racist remark. The sports writer who wrote the piece containing the remark, four members of the editorial board, and the editor in chief subsequently resigned, and the Justice published an editorial claiming that the editors resigned under duress. In a report published in October 2013, the Justice detailed how cuts to the school's Ph.D. programs had resulted in a decrease in the number of enrolled students and teaching fellows. The article's author, news editor Marissa Ditkowsky, subsequently received the American Association of University Professors‚Äô 2014 award for Excellence in Student Coverage of Higher Education. Ditkowsky told the AAUP, ‚ÄúThis trend is one that is occurring not only at Brandeis but also nationally. Cutting doctoral students is affecting universities that are interested in maintaining funds for other purposes and are concerned more about the business model than the educational process.‚Äù Brandeis announced in the spring of 2014 that feminist and activist Ayaan Hirsi Ali would be one of five honorary degree recipients at its commencement ceremony in May. The Justice covered the resulting outcry, as students and faculty argued that some of Hirsi Ali's past statements harshly criticizing Islam constituted Islamophobia and hate speech. Brandeis president Frederick M. Lawrence quickly rescinded Hirsi Ali's degree. Media outlets such as Al Jazeera America and the New York Times cited the Justice‚Äôs coverage of the community‚Äôs backlash. Reuters mentioned the Justice‚Äôs editorial calling on Brandeis to retract Hirsi Ali‚Äôs invitation and quoted managing editor Glen Chesir, who explained, ‚ÄúShe has the right to her opinion ... (but) an honorary degree is an endorsement.‚Äù In April 2015, the Justice covered Take Back the Night, a public event on campus dedicated to raising awareness of sexual violence. A number of students and administrators criticized the newspaper for anonymously quoting sexual assault survivors and demanded that it alter or remove the article. The Student Press Law Center reported that in August 2015, three editors were notified by a law office ‚Äúhired by the university to investigate the case for a potential lawsuit‚Äù that the event's ‚Äúsafe space mentality‚Äù made Take Back the Night a private event ‚Äî and consequently illegal for the Justice‚Äôs reporter to have recorded without explicit permission from participants. The following February, the university informed the Justice that a student had filed a complaint alleging that its coverage of Take Back the Night violated the school‚Äôs Electronic Device and Privacy policy. In March, the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education demanded that the university dismiss all charges, writing that ‚Äúthreatening student journalists with discipline for accurately reporting on a public event is a severe violation of the freedom of expression that Brandeis promises to its students and claims to cherish.‚Äù Brandeis dropped the charges less than a week later and subsequently clarified its policy, explicitly permitting student journalists to record public events. The Justice currently releases a 20-page print paper every Tuesday for distribution throughout the Brandeis University campus, as well as PDF versions of printed media on its website. The editorial board consists of all editors in the masthead (except for the news editors) and meets twice per week to discuss the editorial(s) for each issue. The masthead and contact information for all the editors are also published on the Justice‚Äôs website, as are the newspaper‚Äôs constitution and code of ethics. The Brandeis University Library has kept archives of the Justice since the newspaper's creation in 1949. They are available for public viewing on the website as PDFs.

Early life and career He was born in 1905 in the town of Limni in Euboea. He studied at the Medical School of the University of Athens, where he also became politically active as director of Neolaia, the newspaper of the Central Committee of the Young Communist League of Greece (OKNE), and assistant editor of the Communist Party of Greece's (KKE) official newspaper, Rizospastis. After a time in prison, he left Greece in 1931 and moved to Vienna and thence to Paris in 1933. He worked there as correspondent of Rizospastis, before moving to the Soviet Union. He returned to Greece after the establishment of the dictatorial Metaxas Regime, but was arrested and imprisoned in Aegina. After completing his compulsory military service, he was sent to internal exile to the islands of Sifnos and Kimolos, along with fellow KKE members Miltiadis Porfyrogennis, Chrysa Hatzivasileiou, and Petros Rousos. World War II, Civil War, and aftermath Bust of Karagiorgis in Athens Following the start of the Greco-Italian War, they managed to escape. Karagiorgis returned to Athens, where he played a major role in the Party's underground press and the mobilization of civil servants. In the December 1943 party congress, he was elected alternate member of the Central Committee, and sent to Thessaly to supervise the operations of the National Liberation Front (EAM) and its armed wing, the Greek People's Liberation Army (ELAS). Throughout the subsequent period until the end of the Axis occupation of Greece, he was the senior KKE and EAM official in Thessaly. In 1944 he was elected to the National Council. After liberation in 1944, he became director of Rizospastis and the weekly Rizos tis Defteras. After the outbreak of the Greek Civil War and the closing of Rizospastis, he fled Athens to the mountains of Thessaly, where he joined the Communist-run Democratic Army of Greece (DSE). In March 1948, he was moved from Thessaly to the command of the DSE General Headquarters for Southern Greece. Heavily wounded in action, he was sent to Hungary to be operated on, and on his return was made a member of the communists' \\"Mountain Government\\" as Minister for War Supply (April 1949). After the defeat of the DSE and the end of the conflict in autumn 1949, he accused KKE General Secretary Nikos Zachariadis as responsible for the defeat, for which he was dismissed from all his Party offices and membership, and imprisoned in Romania. He was interrogated by KKE members and by the Romanian Securitate, and died in prison in MƒÉrƒÉcineni, probably in 1955.

In 2009, she moved to UC Irvine as an Assistant Professor, as well as a Visiting Assistant Professor at Princeton University's Center for Health & Wellbeing. In 2013, she was hired as an Assistant Professor in UCLA's Department of Public Policy. In 2014, she was promoted to Associate Professor, followed by promotion to full Professor in 2018.  Research and academic work  Shah's work has focused on sex work in both developing countries and the United States. Her study Risky Business: The Market for Unprotected Sex with Paul Gertler and Stefano Bertozzi was published in 2005 in the Journal of Political Economy. The study focused on how beauty and willingness to have unprotected sex effected the bargaining power and earnings of sex workers in Mexico. Shah made other contributions to our understanding of beauty's role in the organization of sex markets. For instance, in The Prostitute's Allure: The Return to Beauty in Commercial Sex Markets published with Raj Arunachalam in 2012 in B.E. Journal of Economic Analysis & Policy, Shah showed further evidence that beauty was economically valued in illicit sex markets in Ecuador and Mexico.https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/cc55/d4ac3dd95c3b279034d8238dd153cf4e0aa0.pdf Her work has also challenged a common claim in economics that female sex workers are compensated relatively well for their low-skilled labor because they are sacrificing value in marriage prospects by engaging in sex work. In a 2008 paper in the American Econimc Review: Papers & Proceedings Shah and Arunachalam provide evidence that in a sample of sex workers from Ecuador and Mexico, sex workers were more likely to be married than non-sex workers at younger ages. Shah has studied the effect of regulation and suppression of sex workers on various women's health outcomes including domestic violence and sexually transmitted infections. In a 2011 paper, Gertler and Shah found that enforcing street prostitution regulations reduces STIs among street prostitutes. But, increasing enforcement in the brothel sector increases the chances that a sex worker will ever be infected with an STI, suggesting that enforcement has mixed impacts on STI dynamics depending on the target of the regulations. Cunningham and Shah followed this theme with a historical study of a decriminilization of indoor sex work in Rhode Island in 2003. Here they found that the decriminalization of indoor sex work caused a 30% reduction in reported rapes and a 40% reduction in female gonorrhea incidence. The authors suggest these changes were due to increased services available to now- legitimized sex workers, as well as potential sex offenders turning to sex workers over sexual violence due to the decreased monetary and social cost of patronizing sex workers. Shah has also contributed to our understanding of the way in which internet technology improves the functioning of male sex markets. In a 2013 paper, Logan and Shah noted that internet sex markets allowed potential sex workers and clients to engage in signalling, sharing photographs with certain clients to convey safety and in return receive higher earnings. Shah was also co-editor of the Oxford University Press Handbook for the Economics of Prostitution with Scott Cunningham in 2016. Shah has made contributions to the relationship between people's risky behaviors and natural disasters. In March 2014, Manisha Shah and Lisa Cameron, published a paper: Risk-Taking Behavior in the Wake of Natural Disasters. This paper proposes \\"while experiencing natural disasters, people usually tend to be more risk- averse than usual\\". http://jhr.uwpress.org/content/50/2/484.refs References Year of birth missing (living people) Living people American economists UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs faculty University of California, Berkeley alumni ","title":"Manisha Shah"},{"id":"58956322","text":"The Habsiguda Metro Station is located on the Blue Line of the Hyderabad Metro.

He is the Managing Principal of West Egg Development, a New York-based real estate development and investment company. In 2011, he was charged with impersonation and related crimes in connection with charging students to take standardized tests on their behalf. His operations caused the College Board and the Educational Testing Service to radically reform the way that standardized tests are secured and administered.  Early life  Eshaghoff was born in 1992 in Great Neck, New York. His father Roland Eshaghoff is a real estate manager and his mother Janet Esagoff is a real estate attorney. He was raised in Great Neck and attended John L. Miller Great Neck North High School. He attended the University of Michigan, later transferring to Emory University. He ultimately earned his Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) degree from the Zicklin School of Business in New York, majoring in finance and real estate.  Real estate  Eshaghoff is the founder and Managing Principal of West Egg Development, a New York-based real estate development and investment manager. His firm is known to be involved in numerous projects throughout the Greater New York City area, with a focus on emerging submarkets. * Eshaghoff's firm is developing 36-apartment project on East 53rd Street in East Flatbush, Brooklyn. The complex consists of four sites that West Egg Development assembled in 2019-2020, including three contiguous mid-block parcels, and one lot on the corner of Winthrop Street. Eshaghoff is one of many developers to be known for starting projects in East Flatbush, including The Moinian Group, RiseBoro, Monadnock Development, and Dattner Architects. * According to The New York Times, Eshaghoff purchased the property located at 22-80 Steinway Street in Astoria, Queens in July 2020. * Eshaghoff is known to be developing a luxury mixed-use building at 215-16 Northern Boulevard in Bayside, Queens. The site was improved by a zoning lot merger and transfer of air rights from the property next door. * New York real estate publication Traded NY reported in January 2018 that Eshaghoff also acquired 2068 Story Avenue in the Soundview neighborhood of the Bronx with partners Sean Nasab and Ariel Moinian, nephew of renowned New York real estate developer Joseph Moinian. = Recognition = * Eshaghoff was named in the \\"2020 Ones to Watch\\" by the New York Real Estate Journal among \\"up and coming professionals as well as industry veterans across all areas of real estate\\". * Eshaghoff is known for having developed and sold the first $1 million dollar homes in the East New York neighborhood of Brooklyn. He built the properties, located at 710-714 Wortman Avenue, in 2018. Real Estate Weekly first broke the news with an exclusive interview of Eshaghoff.  Test taking  Eshaghoff was discovered to have been operating a test-taking enterprise while in high school whereby he charged students to take standardized tests, including the SAT and ACT, on their behalf. Reports estimate that Eshaghoff had taken standardized tests for between 7 and 20 students, charging between $1,500 and $3,600 per exam. Eshaghoff consistently scored in the 97th percentile or better. Eshaghoff was arrested and charged by the district attorney of Nassau County for impersonation and falsification of business documents. He was caught after prosecutors and ETS worked with school officials to compare students' SAT scores with their grade point averages, and conduct handwriting analyses. Eshaghoff was represented by Long Island attorney Matin Emouna.  Aftermath  Eshaghoff and the district attorney‚Äôs office agreed to conditionally discharge the case, provided that Eshaghoff perform substantial community service in tutoring underprivileged students. Eshaghoff withdrew his attendance from Emory University. In response to Eshaghoff's operation, the College Board and ETS were forced to make radical changes to the administration and security of the SAT exam. The College Board hired former FBI Director Louis Freeh to oversee test security and make substantial changes to test administration nationwide, including a requirement that students upload photos of themselves into a database and regulations on the types of permitted identification. The ACT exam, administered by ACT Education also underwent a major security reform. The College Board also began providing law enforcement and government agencies the names of people believed to be engaged in cheating. They have also considered alerting schools when test takers will be coming from other school districts and reducing the number of times the test is administered overseas. The announcement was made at a hearing of the New York State Senate's subcommittee on higher education, and Eshaghoff's methods specifically influenced the new legislation. The College Board has twice since made reforms to improve test integrity.  Media  Eshaghoff starred in a special interview on CBS‚Äôs 60 Minutes titled \\"The Perfect Score: Cheating on the SAT\\". The segment also featured Kurt Landgraf, who was the President of the Educational Testing Service at the time, and Kathleen Rice, who was the District Attorney at the time. The interview was conducted by Alison Stewart. In 2013, the Lifetime network aired The Cheating Pact, a television film based on Eshaghoff's story, starring Daniela Bobadilla, Laura Ashley Samuels, Laura Slade Wiggins, Max Carver, and Cynthia Gibb.

He was awarded the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers in 2016 from Barack Obama. He is a Fellow of the American Physical Society. He is a Nigerian-American.  Early life and education  Akinwande was born in Washington, DC and moved to Nigeria in his early years. He grew up in Ikeja with his parents. His father was the financial controller of Guardian News and his mother worked at the Ministry of Education. He attended Federal Government College, Idoani and became interested in science and engineering. He returned to America in 1994, starting at Cuyahoga community college and eventually transferring to Case Western Reserve University to study electrical engineering and applied physics. During his master's degree he pioneered the design of near-field microwave tips for non-destructive imaging. He was accepted to Stanford University as a graduate student, working on the electronic properties of carbon-based materials. He was selected as an Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Fellow during his PhD. He was also selected as a DARE (Diversifying Academia, Recruiting Excellence) Fellow in 2008. He completed his PhD in 2009. He joined University of Texas at Austin in 2010 as an Assistant Professor in January 2010, and was awarded research grants from several agencies including the National Science Foundation (NSF), Army Research Office (ARO), the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), DARPA, and Office of Naval Research, the latter focusing on high-frequency flexible 2D electronics.  Research and career  Akinwande collaborated with Aixtron on wafer-scale growth of graphene, characterization and integration The collaboration demonstrated scalable growth of polycrystalline graphene using chemical vapour deposition, creating the first 300 mm wafers. In 2011 he published the first textbook on Carbon Nanotube and Graphene Device Physics with Prof. Philip Wong of Stanford University. He was made a senior member of Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) in 2013. He has made several advances in two dimensional graphene electronics. In 2015 he demonstrated the first two dimensional silicene transistor. Akinwande in collaboration with Alessandro Molle's group at CNR, Italy, achieved this by evaporating silicon onto a crystal of silver, monitoring the growth in real- time using scanning tunnelling microscopy. This research breakthrough was selected as one of the top science stories of 2015 by Discover magazine. The silicene work is the most cited Nature Nanotechnology publication of similar age. He was a finalist for the University of Texas at Austin 'UT System Regents‚Äô Outstanding Teaching' Award for several years, the highest teaching recognition in Texas. He went on to demonstrate the thinnest most transparent electronic tattoo sensors made from graphene in 2017, which were less than 500 nm thick and 85% optically transparent. This research was in collaboration with Nanshu Lu's group. The tattoos can be laminated onto human skin like a temporary tattoo, but could measure electrocardiography, electroencephalography, temperature and hydration. He demonstrated the first atomristor by investigating nonvolatile resistance switching using a 2D atomic sheet of molybdenum disulfide. The devices can be as thin as 1.5 nm and have applications in 5G smartphones as zero-static power radio-frequency switches, internet of things and artificial intelligence circuits. The discovery of memory in these systems is expected to be universal amongst 2D materials. He is on the Board of Reviewing Editors for Science, an associate editor of ACS Nano, an editor for Nature journal npj 2D Materials and Applications, and a past editor of IEEE Electron Devices Letters. . He has given about a dozen plenary and keynote talks including the plenary talk at the 2017 SPIE annual meeting Optics & Photonics, where he discussed the progress, opportunities and challenges of 2D electronic devices. He was made an American Physical Society Fellow in 2017 and a Fulbright Fellow in 2018. He will visit the Adam Mickiewicz University in Pozna≈Ñ in 2019.

The award is presented in a glass-front shadowbox and is accompanied by a lapel pin showing a smaller version of the pendant. In 1998, the DEA's SAC Advisory Committee expanded the awarding of the Purple Heart to state and local law enforcement officers who were killed or wounded in the line of duty while working with DEA. As of 2011, 93 individuals had been awarded the DEA Purple Heart Award.  Eligibility  The following criteria must be met in order to be eligible for the DEA Purple Heart Award: * Individuals must have been seriously injured or killed during the performance of duties in an official capacity. * Their injuries or death must have been direct results of hostile or criminal action. * Their injuries required medical treatment or caused death. * Individuals must be any active, retired, or deceased employee of the Drug Enforcement Administration (or its predecessor agencies, such as the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, or the Bureau of Drug Abuse Control) or a state or local law enforcement officer who was killed or wounded while working with the DEA.

While there have been a growing number of players of African or minority descent throughout the history of collegiate and professional football, black players have historically faced difficulty in landing and retaining quarterback roles due to a number of factors. In addition, some black quarterbacks claim to have experienced bias towards or against them due to their race, and tend to be portrayed less favorably in the media than their white colleagues. Though opportunities have mostly opened up in the modern era, the ratio of black quarterbacks remains disproportionate to the overall ratio of black players, as 67% of NFL players are black, yet only 17% of quarterbacks are.  History  Since the earliest days of professional and college football, the number of black players, let alone quarterbacks, has been on the rise. The first black quarterback to start professionally was Bernie Custis for the Hamilton Tiger-Cats of the Canadian Football League in 1951. The first two in the United States were Marlin Briscoe and James Harris, both of the American Football League, in 1968 and 1969, respectively. The AFL was known to be more tolerant towards black players than the rival National Football League, which had harbored racist tendencies until the 1960s under the influence of Washington Redskins owner George Preston Marshall. The two leagues eventually merged to form the current NFL in 1970. The CFL was more welcoming to black quarterbacks than its American counterparts during the mid- twentieth century. By the 1970s, black starting quarterbacks were commonplace and included players such as Warren Moon, who won five Grey Cup championships in Canada before coming to play in the NFL. Moon's success largely broke the stereotype that blacks could not succeed as quarterbacks, which ushered more prominent black quarterbacks into the NFL starting in the 1980s. In 1971, 3% of quarterbacks in the NFL who threw at least 100 passes in the season were black, but by 2001 this number had risen to 35%. The 1999 NFL draft was notable as eight out of thirteen quarterbacks selected that year were black. They include Donovan McNabb, Akili Smith, and Daunte Culpepper, who were selected in the first round. Michael Vick, who was drafted two years later in 2001, became the first black quarterback taken with the first overall pick in the NFL draft. During the 2013 season, 67 percent of NFL players were African American (black people make up 13 percent of the US population), yet only 17 percent of quarterbacks were; 82 percent of quarterbacks were white. In 2017, the New York Giants benched longtime quarterback Eli Manning in favor of Geno Smith, who was declared the starter for one week. The Giants were the last team to never field a black starting quarterback during an NFL season. Though progress has evidently been made, a 2015 study showed that black quarterbacks were still twice as likely to be benched than their white counterparts. Since the inception of the game, only three quarterbacks with known black ancestry have led their team to a Super Bowl victory: Doug Williams in 1988, Russell Wilson in 2014, and Patrick Mahomes, who is multiracial, in 2020. Other black quarterbacks to start in a Super Bowl include Steve McNair in 2000, McNabb in 2005, Colin Kaepernick, who is multiracial, in 2013, and Cam Newton in 2016. Four quarterbacks with black ancestry, namely McNair, Newton, Mahomes, and Lamar Jackson, have won the Associated Press NFL Most Valuable Player Award. In addition, eight quarterbacks with known black ancestry have won the Heisman Trophy: Andre Ware in 1989, Charlie Ward in 1993, Troy Smith in 2006, Newton in 2010, Robert Griffin III in 2011, Jameis Winston in 2013, Jackson in 2016, and Kyler Murray, who is multiracial, in 2018. In Week 1 of the 2020 NFL season, 10 quarterbacks with known black ancestry (Cam Newton, Teddy Bridgewater, Dwayne Haskins, Lamar Jackson, Patrick Mahomes, Kyler Murray, Dak Prescott, Tyrod Taylor, Deshaun Watson, Russell Wilson) started games for their teams, the most ever on opening week.  Stereotyping of black quarterbacks  There is some controversy over how white and black quarterbacks tend to be described by the media, especially with NFL draft prospects. Draft experts and scouts have a history of describing black quarterbacks in ways that perpetuate racial stereotypes and hurt those prospects' chances of making it to the NFL as a quarterback. Even those who make it to the NFL allegedly continue to face this narrative. An empirical study published in The Howard Journal of Communications supported this hypothesis. The researchers analyzed the written descriptions of quarterback prospects in the NFL Draft section of the Sports Illustrated website from 1998 to 2007. They looked at each player's description for words or phrases about athleticism and intelligence and sorted them into categories based on whether they were positive or negative. A significant difference was found between how black and white quarterbacks are described by SI. Black quarterbacks tend to be praised for their athleticism and criticized for a lack of intelligence. Meanwhile, white quarterbacks are often praised for their intelligence and criticized for a lack of athleticism. For example, Dante Culpepper and Tee Martin, both black quarterbacks, were described with terms such as \\"physical specimen\\" and \\"impressive specimen,\\" respectively. Meanwhile, white players were described as \\"good signal callers,\\" and \\"real student[s] of the game.\\" =Wonderlic testing= During the NFL Combine, players are given the Wonderlic Personnel Test, a test of mental aptitude. As of 2018, the average score of active Super Bowl winning quarterbacks is 30.7 which is particularly salient given the fact that a score of 22 is average and the position average is about 24. This list of winning quarterbacks includes Russell Wilson, who got a score of 28. Of all positions, quarterbacks and offensive linemen, particularly centers, have the highest average scores as well as the greatest percentage of white players. Tight end, the position with the next highest position average, also has a greater percentage of white players relative to the league average. There is evidence that higher Wonderlic scores are mildly correlated with lower interception rates and higher passer ratings. However, the Wonderlic test has not been without criticism, with some claiming it is racially biased. In addition, some quarterbacks with low scores, such as Donovan McNabb and Jim Kelly (15 for both), have had long successful careers in the NFL. In 2013, the NFL began administering the Player Assessment Tool, an additional test of mental aptitude to go alongside the Wonderlic during the combine process. Notable examples of quarterbacks affected by racial stereotyping= Marlin Briscoe = After a successful college career as a quarterback, the Denver Broncos drafted Marlin Briscoe in the 14th round of the 1968 NFL/AFL draft, with plans to shift him to the defensive secondary. It was commonplace back then to convert black players who had played quarterback to other positions, but Briscoe did not sign with Denver until he was promised a chance to practice at quarterback. After injuries to Denver's starter, Briscoe became the first black quarterback to start a game in an American major professional football league in 1968. That season, Briscoe threw for 1,589 yards, broke the Broncos‚Äô single-season rookie touchdown record with 14, and finished second in Rookie of the Year voting. Regardless, it became clear that Denver would no longer play him at quarterback, so Briscoe asked for and was granted his release. He then signed with the Buffalo Bills, who put him at wide receiver. Despite his success as a receiver in Buffalo and later with the Miami Dolphins, Briscoe never played quarterback again for the rest of his career. A similar trend would follow Lamar Jackson, another black quarterback, during the 2018 NFL Draft. Despite a prolific career as Louisville's quarterback, Jackson received suggestions to switch to receiver by pundits including Pro Football Hall of Fame general manager Bill Polian, a notion that he adamantly fought off during the draft process. During Jackson's 2019 season as starting quarterback for the Baltimore Ravens, Polian said he was wrong for suggesting a positional switch for him. = James Harris = While Briscoe never played quarterback for the Bills, his teammate James \\"Shack\\" Harris became the first black quarterback to start for the team and was the second overall to start for a team in NFL history. After being released by the Bills and signing with the Los Angeles Rams, Harris stepped in for injured Rams starter John Hadl in 1974, and head coach Chuck Knox made him the permanent starter, a first for any black quarterback. Harris went on to also become the first black quarterback to make the Pro Bowl and start and win an NFL playoff game. However, Harris received hate mail and death threats due to his race, which eventually required security guards to protect him both on the field and at hotels. When Harris suffered injuries, Knox was reportedly pressured by Rams owner Carroll Rosenbloom to play other quarterbacks such as an aging Joe Namath and Pat Haden, even after Harris became healthy again and in spite of Harris leading the NFC in passer rating during his final year in Los Angeles. Harris's demotion and later trade to the San Diego Chargers became a racial issue in Los Angeles, with journalists such as Skip Bayless and Brad Pye Jr. covering the matter. = Donovan McNabb = In 2003, conservative radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh claimed that the media was biased in favor of Donovan McNabb, a prominent black quarterback at the time. Limbaugh stated that \\"the media has been very desirous that a black quarterback do well‚Ä¶ he got a lot of credit for the performance of this team that he really didn't deserve.\\" In a study of news coverage of white and black quarterbacks, political scientist David Niven of Florida Atlantic University disputed Limbaugh's claim, and found that black quarterbacks, including McNabb, did not receive preferential treatment by the media, yet neither did white quarterbacks, noting there were \\"minor\\" and \\"inconsistent\\" differences. = Tyrod Taylor = In a 2017 interview published by The Buffalo News, then-Buffalo Bills quarterback Tyrod Taylor stated that he always knew he would be criticized more than his white counterparts, a sentiment also echoed by Michael Vick and Cam Newton, but that it drives him to be a better player. = Deshaun Watson = Despite his ability to both pass and run effectively, Houston Texans signal-caller Deshaun Watson prefers not to be called a dual-threat quarterback as he believes the term is often used to stereotype black quarterbacks. In 2018, Watson was the subject of racist remarks echoing these stereotypes after making a bad decision in a game. The superintendent of the Onalaska school district outside of Houston, Lynn Redden, came under fire and later resigned for saying that ‚Äúwhen you need precision decision making you can't count on a black quarterback.\\" See also *Race and sports *Black players in professional American football *Quarterback *National Football League controversies Further reading  * An Essay About Black Quarterbacks and the Wonderlic NotesReferences American football controversies Sports controversies Sports culture Black players Black players History of racial segregation in the United States African-American sports history African Americans and sport National Football League controversies ","title":"Racial issues faced by black quarterbacks"},{"id":"58956681","text":"Seva Cafe is an Ahmedabad cafe that works on the concept of pay it forward.

The station was opened with the line in June 1875 and was closed to passengers in January 1931. Full closure of the line was effected in 1963. History The station opened in June 1875 as the only intermediate one between the town of Masham and the junction of the line with the Leeds Northern Railway at . Passenger trains continued on southwards from Melmerby to terminate at railway station. In May 1891, six trains a day were scheduled to call at Tanfield, which had been reduced to four each way by 1902. The journey to Masham took six minutes, with that to Ripon taking seventeen. By the time of the line's closure to passengers by the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) in 1931, just four trains a day were calling at Tanfield. The station was furnished with a passing loop, but only the south side of the station had a platform. The station had low passenger numbers and only issued 7,500 tickets in 1911. Goods mostly consisted of the outward flows of livestock and manure, for which a crane was provided in the goods yard. During the Second World War, ammunition storage in the area increased the number of trains through the station for offloading and forwarding too. The British Army supplied the LNER with extra staff to supplement the two railway workers. Over of munitions were stored near the station which were forwarded out on 42 armament trains in the weeks leading up to D-Day. The line closed to traffic on 11 November 1963. After closure, the station building became derelict but was renovated in 1973 and is now a private dwelling. The station footprint and goods yard was the location of some light industrial units until 2017 when they were converted into a small housing estate.

It covers an area of about and has an average depth of about . The lake is fed by arroyos and springs, some of which are hot springs. Its waters are very rich in arsenic and otherwise salty and slightly alkaline; these properties and the regionally high UV radiation give Laguna Socompa extreme environmental conditions. The lake features the world's highest known stromatoliths, mineralized structures formed by microorganisms. Stromatolith- forming microbes were the dominant lifeforms on Earth fossilized between 3.5 and 1.5 billion years ago and may give insight on early life on Earth. These stromatoliths are found on the southern shore of the lake and led to Laguna Socompa being declared a protected area.  Geography and geomorphology  Laguna Socompa is located at an elevation of in the Los Andes Department of the Salta Province in Argentina, close to the border with Chile. A railway to the border with Chile passes east of Laguna Socompa; the Socompa railway station lies north-northwest of the lake and the Quebrada del Agua station northeast of the lake is even closer. The area is far away from any city or town but sodium sulfate was produced in the area of Laguna Socompa. The lake was defined a protected area in 2011 but is also in the area of the Socompa geothermal power prospect. The lake covers a surface of about and has the form of an \\"L\\" upside down and backwards. Its depth fluctuates between with lower water levels during December to May. The northwestern and eastern shores feature well developed wetland vegetation and are about long, while dry beaches are found elsewhere along the shore. Sandy-stony ground with bush vegetation characterizes the surrounding landscape which is in general mountainous. Reportedly, the area of the lake smells of sulfur. Some arroyos enter into Laguna Socompa, and on the eastern side water flows from the Quebrada del Agua spring towards the lake; part of its water is piped to an old mill at the railway. Additional springs occur around and within the lake. On the western-southwestern margins of the lake, hot springs with temperatures of up to ‚Äì are found; volcanic activity represented by the Socompa volcano is responsible for heating the waters of the hot springs. The activity of the hot springs has resulted in the deposition of diatomite and sodium sulfate along the shores. The waters of the lake are somewhat alkaline, turbid, brackish to hypersaline and have a high arsenic content. The lakefloor is covered by material with a composition resembling brine, clay and silt. Oncolites have also been reported from Laguna Socompa. The lake is situated at the foot of the active volcano Socompa within a depression at its foot; the depression was formerly a north-northwest trending valley before the volcano grew in the valley. The volcano features steaming ground and fumaroles at its summit.  Climate and environment  The lake is part of the cold, dry Puna where temperatures vary strongly between day and night and precipitation only occurs in summer. In summer temperatures range from and in winter from . The region has the highest solar flux in the world, including the largest amount of ultraviolet radiation. The small lakes in the Puna desert are influenced by extreme environmental conditions such as large amounts of toxic elements such as arsenic, high salinity and strong ultraviolet radiation as the ozone column is less dense at high elevations; these lakes in general receive more insolation than any other place on Earth. Because of the dry climate, most of the lakes lose water mainly through evaporation and thus tend to accumulate salt and arsenic.  Biology  Small lakes in the Puna are places where birds concentrate in comparison to the surrounding environments. About 27 bird species have been observed at Laguna Socompa, including both waterbirds and terrestrial birds; the most common are Anas flavirostris (yellow-billed teal), Hirundo rustica (barn swallow), Larus seranus, Lessonia rufa (austral negrito) and Lophonetta specularioides (crested duck). Among mammals, vicu√±as have been reported. The vegetation in the wetlands around the lake is characterized by Cyperaceae and Graminaceae. Underwater vegetation does not occur in Laguna Socompa owing to the brackish water. There is little phytoplankton in the lake waters, mainly cyanobacteria and diatoms. = Microorganisms = Microorganisms that live in the lakes and wetlands of the dry Andes have to resist harmful environmental traits and thus become extremely hardy with e.g. high UV radiation tolerance. They often also produce secondary metabolites that are of interest to the industry, such as medicine, UV blocking and bioremediation, which has spurred research in these extreme environments. Furthermore, they are considered to be potential analogs to extraterrestrial life due to the environmental conditions. Several microorganisms in the lake have been isolated and studied, with their genomes sequenced. Among these is Exiguobacterium sp. strain 17 which was first isolated in Laguna Socompa; it possesses a number of genes involved in metabolizing arsenic and other toxic compounds and protecting and repairing the genome. Other strains from Laguna Socompa whose genomes have been sequenced are Salinivibrio sp. strain 34 and 35. = Stromatoliths = Photo of stromatoliths in Laguna Socompa In 2009, researchers discovered the presence of stromatoliths at Laguna Socompa; stromatoliths are layered structures formed by microorganisms when their metabolism causes the accumulation of minerals. These are the first stromatoliths found in Argentina and the highest site where stromatoliths have been recorded to date; their existence was the reason why the lake was made a protected area. The discovery of stromatoliths at Laguna Socompa and the extreme conditions that exist there offers insights into the development of early life on Earth as microbe-formed structures like stromatoliths were the main traces of life from between 3.5 and 1.5 billion years ago before stromatoliths declined between 1 and 0.7 billion years ago due to the development of burrowing and grazing lifeforms. Previously stromatoliths were known mainly from marine and carbonatic environments such as in the Bahamas, the Coorong Lagoon and Shark Bay in Australia, the Lagoa Salgada in Brazil and the Laguna Bacalar in Mexico. The Laguna Socompa stromatoliths are the first to be discovered at elevations exceeding ; the presence of active hot springs may be responsible for their formation. These stromatoliths have a layered structure and cone-like shapes that sometimes overlap and then form large domes, unlike the bushy or crustose stromatoliths found elsewhere, and are found underwater on the southern shores of the lake, protected from the strong UV radiation. They have a layered structure, with the layers having distinct appearances on the surface and inside of the stromatolite. The UV protective carotenoid pigment deinoxanthin gives them a pink colour. Unusually, some stromatoliths are formed out of halite rather than the more common aragonite/carbonate although aragonite and silica are their most important building materials. The dominant bacteria in the stromatoliths are Microcoleus cyanobacteria and deinococci in the surface; there are also eukaryotic algae, diatoms. Other taxa include Desulfobacterales, Rhodobacteraceae and Spirochaetes and mostly represent novel lineages; the extreme conditions of these high elevation lakes lead to high extremophile diversity. Some of the Laguna Socompa stromatoliths are classified as Conophyton stromatoliths, which are otherwise only known as Precambrian (over 541 ¬± 1 million years old) fossils.

Marasmius epidryas or Mycetinis epidryas) is one of a group of mushrooms formerly in the genus Marasmius. It grows amongst dwarf shrubs of the genus Dryas in arctic or high mountain environments. Description The species can be described as follows: *The cap is brownish yellow and grows to about 1 cm in diameter. *The gills are white and fairly distant, and broadly attached to the stem. The spore powder is white. *The stem can grow to 4 cm tall by up to 2 mm in diameter, being broader at the apex. It is brown above and blackish brown at the base, with a velvety covering of hairs. *The smell and taste are not distinctive. *The spores are roughly ellipsoid or almond-shaped and measure roughly 8.5-10.5 ¬µm x 5-7 ¬µm. Naming and related species The species epithet is the Ancient Greek prefix \\"epi-\\" (·ºêœÄŒØ), meaning \\"on\\", followed by Dryas, the genus of plants with which it grows. This species was originally described as Marasmius epidryas by Robert K√ºhner in 1935 in the annals of the Linnaean Society of Lyon, but the definition was considered invalid due to the lack of a Latin description according to the updated nomenclatural rules. In 2009 Anna Ronikier published a correct description ascribing the name to K√ºhner (that is, giving credit to him) and so the first valid name with author attribution was \\"Marasmius epidryas K√ºhner ex A. Ronikier\\". Then in 2011 Anna & Mache≈Ç Ronikier established that the species belongs in the new genus Rhizomarasmius and redefined the current name accordingly. Ecology and distribution This mushroom is found exclusively in cushions of Dryas plants such as D. octopetala (mountain avens) and D. integrifolia (entire-leaved avens), growing saprobically on dead leaves and stems. It only occurs in arctic or high mountain environments. It is reported from arctic regions of Europe and North America, the Rocky and Altai mountains, and various mountain ranges in Europe.

The genus is named after Offa, a king from the ancient kingdom of Mercia, and colus, a person who dwelled among (this time referring to) the Offa's Dyke. The species name honors Robert Joseph King, a British mineralogist who found the fossils of Offacolus. Classification Offacolus is the only genus in the monotypic family Offacolidae, classified in the clade Euchelicerata together with the genus Dibasterium and the clade Prosomapoda. A phylogenetic analysis (the results presented in a cladogram below) conducted by James Lamsdell in 2013 on the relationships within the Xiphosura and the relations to other closely related groups concluded that the Xiphosura, as presently understood, was paraphyletic (a group sharing a last common ancestor but not including all descendants of this ancestor) and thus not a valid phylogenetic group. Offacolus was recovered as the sister taxon (closest relative) of Prosomapoda.

Action The plot is very similar to that of Voltaire's earlier unsuccessful tragedy √âriphyle. The action takes place in a courtyard in front of the palace of S√©miramis in Babylon, in front of the Hanging Gardens. S√©miramis, after having her husband Ninos poisoned, now rules the Babylonian Empire. She now decides to marry the stranger Arsace instead of Assur, Prince of the B√©lus. Arsace learns that he is in fact Ninias, the son, presumed dead, of S√©miramis and Ninos. Assur tries to eliminate his rival Arsace; S√©miramis tries to save her son, but is mortally wounded by him in a scuffle. Arsace/Ninias thereby avenges his father's death. Dispute with Cr√©billon When Voltaire was given the opportunity to write a piece of grand theatre to commemorate the birth of the dauphin‚Äôs first son in 1746, he selected the apparently inappropriate story of the ancient queen Semiramis. The theme of a ruler who poisoned her husband, fell in love with her own son and ultimately met her death was not one that appeared to have the expected celebratory qualities. Voltaire claimed that the play would restore French tragedy to its classical glory, an aspiration worthy of a new prince. In the event the birth went badly and the young dauphine Maria Teresa died. The play was therefore not performed at court or in the public theatre, but Voltaire sent a copy to Frederick the Great in February 1747. S√©miramis became a focal point for the bitter dispute between Voltaire and his older rival Prosper Jolyot de Cr√©billon. Cr√©billon was favoured by Madame de Pompadour, who secured him the position of royal librarian and gave him a pension. Cr√©billon was also the royal censor, and had previously irritated Voltaire by demanding changes in Temple du go√ªt (1733) and then stopped the performances of Mahomet (1742) and La Mort de C√©sar (1743). Voltaire decided to retaliate by selecting, one after another, classical themes for his tragedies which Cr√©billon had used earlier, to demonstrate the superiority of his own treatment of the material. The first of these plays, S√©miramis, dealt with a plot Cr√©billon had used in his tragedy of the same name in 1717. He followed this up with Oreste (1750) and Rome sauv√©e (1752). Cr√©billon was angry with Voltaire's choice of S√©miramis. He first required a number of irritating changes from Voltaire, and then immediately authorised the publication of a parody of the play - not uncommon at the time - which was performed at the Com√©die Italienne and then for the court at Fontainebleu, and which Voltaire felt singled him out for ridicule.Siegfried Detemple: Semiramis, in: Voltaire: Die Werke. Katalog zum 300. Geburtstag. Reichert, Wiesbaden 1994 The staging of the play became another battleground between the followers of Cr√©billon and partisans of Voltaire. Traditionally part of the stage in the Com√©die- Fran√ßaise was occupied by gentlemen spectators, and Cr√©billon supported this status quo. However Voltaire wanted grand and lavish sets, and the theatrical effect of a ghost would be lost if there were spectators sitting close to where he appeared. He therefore insisted on clearing the stage. Critical reception The play was first performed at the court of Stanis≈Çaw Leszczy≈Ñski in Lun√©ville, but its public premiere was on August 29, 1748 at the Com√©die- Fran√ßaise. It became one of Voltaire's greatest stage successes, not only in France but internationally, as it was performed in many European capitals. St. Petersburg was an exception, as Catherine the Great found the theme of a queen murdering her husband uncongenial. Voltaire's text was the basis for the libretto by Gaetano Rossi used by Gioachino Rossini for his opera Semiramide. An English translation of the play was printed in 1760, and adaptations of it were staged at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in 1776 and the King's Theatre, Haymarket in 1794. Printed editions In 1749 a version of the play, printed by Lambert, appeared without naming the author. Three other unauthorized printings followed in the same year. Voltaire added a treatise on ancient and modern tragedy as a preface and an appendix in honour of the dead officers of the War of Austrian Succession.

Career  In 1994 in London, Prof. Surinder Singh founded the Raj Academy of Asian Music, which later became the non-profit organisation now known as Raj Academy Conservatoire. The Academy is an international institution and it quickly became one of the foremost schools for the study and practice of Sikh Music and Gurmat Sangeet ('music of Guru‚Äôs wisdom') of the Sikh musical tradition, teaching the art of playing ancient musical instruments of India including the Rabab, Taus, Saranghi Dilruba, Saranda and Jori. He is also a founding member of Naad Yoga Council, which was founded in 2008. He has taught Sikh Music and Naad Yoga in various places throughout the world including the UK, Canada, USA, Germany, Spain, France, and India, with over 3000 students around the world. In 2006 Surinder Singh was awarded the status of Professor of Musicology at Thames Valley University (now University of West London). He taught degree courses at the university in Sikh Music, Naad Yoga and Classical Indian Music until 2012. In 2017, he launched the first multi-award winning documentary on Sikh Music called \\"Sikh Musical Heritage: The Untold Story\\".  Early life  Prof. Surinder Singh was born and brought up in India and like many Sikhs hails from an Indian military family. In his younger years he would spend time with Yogis, Sadhus and Spiritual people.His early childhood was strongly influenced by Indian classical music, which he practised from the age of nine. His earliest teachers were Mahant Ajit Singh for musicology and Gyani Najar Singh for rhythm. During his teenage years Surinder Singh had the great privilege of studying singing, composition and musicology under the Guru- Shishya Parampara (intensive personal training under a master) with Pandit Kharayti Lal Tahim from the Delhi Gharana. His musical training was continued in England under Surjit Singh Aulakh, a senior student of Pandit Ram Narayan Ji. In 1988, aged 19, Surinder Singh gained a BA in Economics at NJSA College, Kapurthala. A year later he graduated with an MA in Classical Indian Music at APJ College of Fine Arts, Jalandhar, followed by an MPhil in Classical Indian Music at Guru Nanak Dev University, Amritsar.  Awards  Matharu received the title of professor whilst working for the Thames Valley University developing the first ever, globally recognised, degree in Sikh Music.

The first specimen was discovered in the Qiupa Formation of Luanchuan County, in the Henan Province. The specimen consists of a partial skeleton with a nearly complete skull, and was made the holotype of the new genus and species Yubaartar zhongyuanensis by the Chinese palaeontologist Li Xu and colleagues in 2015. The generic name consists of the word Yu, which is the pinyin spelling of the Chinese character for the Henan Province, and the Mongolian word baatar, which means \\"hero\\", a word commonly used as suffix in the names of Asian multituberculates. The specific name comes from Zhongyuan, an ancient name for the geographic area of the province. Holotype skull shown from below and above; it is partially distorted Yubaatar is the first known and southernmost Late Cretaceous multituberculate outside of the Mongolian plateau (most multituberculate specimens mainly consist only of teeth and jaws, and are rarely found in eastern Asia). With a skull 7 cm long, Yubaatar is estimated to have been the size of a black-footed ferret, and was the largest member of the group known from Eurasia (larger members are known from North America). Sphenopsalis was similar in size, but most other Mesozoic multituberculates were the size of a shrew or rat. Yubaatar had a unique feature among multituberculates in that its last upper premolar was replaced. The holotype specimen had a palaeopathology unique among known Mesozoic mammal, a severely broken right tibia bone, which was probably damaged in an accident, but had healed. Yubaatar was found to be basal to the clade Taeniolabidoidea, which consists of North American and Asian multituberculates; this indicates there was a faunal interchange between Asia and North America before the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene transition. The morphology of Yubaatar indicates that diversity in the complexity of the teeth of mutituberculates, relating to their diets, increased with the number of genera and difference in body size, and that there wa sa shift in adaptations towards increased herbivory in the group across the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene boundary.

The riots were sparked by an attempt by the British government to exterminate the city's stray dogs, controversial for Parsis due to dogs being considered sacred in the Zoroastrian religion. The event was the first instance of rioting in the modern history of Mumbai.  History = Background = Mumbai, known as Bombay until the late 20th century, has long been a center for trade and commerce in Western India. Due to the city's important position at the mouth of four rivers, the city became a haven for both domestic and foreign merchant communities.Palsetia, Jesse S. (2001). The Parsis of India: Preservation of Identity in Bombay City. Brill. . Retrieved 11 November 2008. pp. 189 One such group was the Parsis, whom had fled Persia in the aftermath of the Muslim conquest of Persia in the 7th century. The Parsis followed the teachings of the Prophet Zoroaster, and subscribed to Iranian Zoroastrianism. Once in Bombay, the Parsis quickly ingrained themselves into the city's thriving trade network; thus, the Parsi population of the city grew wealthy and influential. They also developed their own sub-sect of Zoroastrianism which melded Persian and Indian beliefs.Palsetia, Jesse S. ‚ÄúMad Dogs and Parsis: The Bombay Dog Riots of 1832.‚Äù Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, vol. 11, no. 1, 2001, pp. 13‚Äì30. JSTOR, JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/25188081. Beginning in the 16th century, European powers began to send merchants and soldiers to India to take control of local trade. Bombay was taken by the Portuguese in 1534, who held the city until the British East India Company took control of the port in 1661. Whereas the Portuguese had used Bombay as a trade outpost in India, the East India Company chose instead to invest company funds in developing the city. In addition, the British began a policy (formulated by Gerald Aungier, the 2nd Governor of BombayMurray, Sarah Elizabeth (2007). Moveable Feasts: From Ancient Rome to the 21st century, the Incredible Journeys of the Food We Eat. Macmillan. . Retrieved 2 February 2008. pp. 79) of cooperation with Bombay's merchant communities by offering them protection and business incentives; one of the groups that took advantage of this was the Parsis, who were sometimes referred to as the Shetias. The Parsis and the British administration were noted as having gotten along well, as many Parsis were employed by the British administration and the British allowed the practice of the Parsi faith in Bombay. By 1826, around 10,000 Parsis lived in Bombay, which had a total population of 200,000. = Riots = In 1832, the British-administered magistrate of police decided to adopt measures to control the city's stray dog population. The city was filled with so-called \\"Pariah dogs\\", which were seen by authorities as a nuisance and a threat to public safety. A regulation had been in place since 1813 that allowed for the killing of owner-less dogs during the hottest parts of the Bombay summer (15 April - 15 May, and 15 September - 15 October); the new regulation would extend the first period of culling from 15 May to 15 June. The change in the regulation was not controversial, but the Magistrate also chose to adopt new methods to cull the dog population. Most significantly, it was decided that a bounty would be paid for each dog killed. This new policy resulted in unscrupulous or overzealous dog catchers killing dogs that were not overly aggressive; it was also reported that dog catchers were invading homes and killing private pets. A backlash formed against the dog culling policy. As noted by the contemporary Bombay Courier, the city magistrate was seen by Bombay's Indian population as overusing its power. The Parsi community was particularity offended, as the extended culling period meant that the slaughter coincided with a Parsi holy day; furthermore, some Parsis revered dogs as objects of religious significance and began to protest the magistrate's efforts. On 6 June, a crowd of Parsis attacked a group of dog catchers near Bombay's fort and then marched on the city's court to demand an end to the culling. The next day, many in the Parsi community closed their businesses, causing economic chaos in the city. Lower class Parsis and a collection of Hindus and Muslims went on strike, paralyzing more of the city's day-to-day activities. When word circulated that the British were mobilizing the city's garrison, the Parsis organized crowds to block porters and laborers in a successful attempt to prevent the British troops from receiving food and water. In the evening, the British garrison gathered in the city's fort and the Riot Act was read aloud; the crowd was subsequently broken up, and the leaders of the strike were arrested. The British government then began to negotiate with the leaders of the Parsi community in an attempt to return order to the city. It was decided that, rather than cull stray dogs on sight, the Magistrate would instead try to relocate dogs outside of the city. This was done, and the imprisoned protesters were released as they had not had a political motivation for striking. = Aftermath = The year after the riots, the new dog culling policy resulted in many of the animals being relocated to the outskirts of Bombay. The event also increased the already-prevalent influence of the Parsi community in Bombay.

He holds honorary doctorate degrees from both Alaska Pacific University and the University of Alaska Anchorage. Notti served in the United States Navy during the Vietnam War.  Career  Notti aided in developing the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) signed into law by President Richard Nixon on December 18, 1971, constituting at the time the largest land claims settlement in United States history. ANCSA was intended to resolve long-standing issues surrounding aboriginal land claims in Alaska and could, perhaps, be considered an ending of more than a century of endeavor by the Native people of the state to secure their land, as well as to stimulate economic development throughout Alaska. Notti was the first President of the Alaska Federation of Natives and Doyon‚Äôs third President, a regional corporation who owns 12.5 million acres.https://www.doyon.com/shareholder-spotlight-emil-notti/ Notti worked for Autonetics, a division of North American Aviation, on the LGM-30 Minuteman during the Cold War. Later, he served under several Alaska Governors as Deputy Commissioner of Health and Social Services, Commissioner of Community and Regional Affairs and Commissioner of Commerce, Community and Economic Development. Notti served under Bill Sheffield, and Sarah Palin. Notti served on numerous boards, including the National Bank of Alaska (acquired by Wells Fargo), the Alaska Railroad, a two time Board of Trustees for APFC (the United State's largest Sovereign Wealth Fund with $75 billion under management), and Cook Inlet Regional, Inc. Notti was the Democratic nominee for the 1973 Alaska's at-large congressional district special election, losing narrowly to Don Young. =AFN and ANCSA= In 1966, Notti called for a Statewide meeting inviting numerous leaders around Alaska to gather and create the first meeting of a committee. The meeting was held October 18, 1966 - on the 99th anniversary of the transfer of Alaska from Russia. Notti presided over the three-day conference as it discussed matters of land recommendations, claims committees, and political challenges the act would have getting through Congress.The growing presence and political importance of Natives were evidenced when association leaders were elected to the legislature. Members of the association gathered and were able to gain seven of the sixty seats in the legislature. When the group met a second time early in 1967, it emerged with a new name, The Alaska Federation of Natives, and a new full-time President, Notti. Before ANCSA, the Native population had gone through numerous hardships over the last century from European expansion. In the mid-1700s Alaska's population (according to James Mooney) was home to an estimated 74,000 Eskimos, Indians, and Aleuts. After the purchase of Alaska by the United States in 1867, Alaska remained classified as a territory. \\"Thus, without further ceremony,\\" wrote historian Bancroft, \\"this vast area of land, belonging by right to neither, was transferred from one European race to the offshoot of another.\\" Negotiations regarding the purchase of the land were conducted with such speed that the treaty itself was hastily drawn and failed to define clearly the status of Natives, their rights, or matters of land ownership. Only one paragraph (part of Article III) was devoted to the inhabitants of Russia-America. It was not until 1959 that Alaska would officially be incorporated as a state. At hearings held in Fairbanks and Anchorage the October 17 and 18, 1969 prior to the passage of ANCSA, Notti commented pushing that the money in the bill was not enough \\"The $500 million provision of our bill may seem like a lot of money, but after looking at the conditions in our villages, $500 million will only give our Native people a chance to operate on a standard of living of what we consider basic minimums, I think, for the rest of the United States.\\"http://www.alaskool.org/projects/ancsa/testimony/ancsa_hearings/e_notti_s.html In its final bill, ANCSA granted the Native people of Alaska over $900 million. The ANCSA included of 44 million acres (180,000 km2) and $962.5 million patented and titles transferred to twelve Alaska Native regional corporations and over 200 local village corporations. The surface rights to the patented land were granted to the village corporations and the subsurface right to the land was granted to the regional corporation, creating a split estate pursuant to section 14(f). Notti also cast the tie-breaking vote to enter Sealaska and Tlingit and Haida into the Alaska Federation of Natives.

The ARG was produced by veteran ARG creators Alice & Smith, and featured NPCs, actors, and live events. The ARG encompassed several \\"seasons,\\" each leading to a new update for No Man's Sky. Season 1 of Waking Titan led to the release of the Atlas Rises update, and Season 2 to the release of No Man's Sky: NEXT. Overview=Premise= Waking Titan surrounds the innovative technologies and dangerous experiments employed by a multi-disciplinary research organization called The Atlas Foundation, its family of businesses, and their branching associates. Season One focused on Loop16, an AI out of a series of AIs designed to test simulation theory by harnessing virtually infinite processing power to create a highly complex simulation‚Äîstanding to match or transcend the complexity of our own universe. This season explored the consequences of using these simulations to predict future events. Season Two's focus was on W/ARE, a company pioneering the next era of virtual reality technology with advanced non-invasive brain-machine interface headsets that induce artificial lucid- dreams. =Plot= Season One of Waking Titan was divided into three phases. During Phase One, wakingtitan.com hosted six triangles in the middle of the page. These triangles were referred to as \\"Sigils\\", while the white icons along the bottom of the page were referred to as \\"Glyphs\\". Each sigil and glyph, when clicked, lead to a password entry prompt - the correct passwords for all six sigils and the first five glyphs were discovered via puzzle- solving during Phase One of Waking Titan. The sigil and glyph puzzles were solved collaboratively - while it may have been possible to solve some of these puzzles individually, most of them required a collaborative effort. Some puzzles required players to meet agents from the Atlas Corporation in person, and to relay information obtained from these meetings back to the community. This phase culminated on July 8, 2017, with a congratulatory message from Elizabeth Leighton, the CEO of the Atlas Foundation. During Phase Two, wakingtitan.com hosted a command-line interface terminal. Various commands were accepted as input, which triggered different events. These commands hinted to the introduction of a fourth race to No Man's Sky. Additionally, project-wt.com hosted a \\"Calibration\\" utility during Phase Two. To successfully perform these calibrations, players had to upload images of various objects and buildings to the site. For instance, the first calibration required images of \\"public resonant percussion instruments\\". Finally, towards the end of Phase Two, a Waking Titan Twitch stream went live, displaying a five-monitor setup. Throughout the duration of the stream, players had to work together to solve puzzles that were displayed on these monitors. Some of these puzzles were interactive; for example, one puzzle that was repeated several times involved the Twitch chat guiding a virtual hamster through a maze. Players solved another three glyphs throughout Phase Two. Phase Three consisted of the conclusion of the Twitch stream that began at the end of Phase Two. Players solved more interactive puzzles on the Twitch stream, before the rogue AI Loop16 asked them a final question: \\"Should I exist?\\" The overwhelming response from the community was \\"yes\\". After receiving this response, Loop16 and Emily of the ETARC forums were revealed as being one and the same. Loop16 generated a heartfelt \\"Thank You\\" video to round out the stream, before finally taking the 72-hour stream offline. Shortly after this, players received emails with the subject line \\"Waking Titan has Ended.\\" On August 11, 2017, the Atlas Rises update was released for No Man's Sky. On March 26, 2018, a second season of Waking Titan began to promote No Man's Sky's NEXT update.

Description The shortspine chimaera is similar to the other species in its genus, but of uniformly dark brown to black colour. It has a robust body, and has a shorter spine than first dorsal fin. Although it has a similar range and appearance to the southern chimaera, the shortspine chimaera is darker in colour and smaller. A maximum size of at least 95 cm total length (including tail) and 53 cm body length (excluding tail) in females has been reported. Distribution and habitat The shortspine chimaera is a subtropical species, inhabiting the upper to mid continental slope on the east coast of Australia, at depths of around 450-1,080 m, although it most commonly lives in waters deeper than 1,025 m. In particular, the species is found near Tuncurry, New South Wales; sightings have been reported in other spots on the east coast, from Ulladulla to Queensland, but it is probable that these are actually a different species. It is not targeted commercially, and most fisheries trawl in waters shallower than where the species typically lives, so no conservation actions are currently taking place for the species; however, it may be a bycatch for deepwater fisheries. The exact population of the species is unknown, but is listed as least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

She was previously signed to the Butterz record label and is now signed to Hospital Records . She is one third of the UK garage act TQD, alongside fellow producers Royal-T and DJ Q. Early life Gooding spent her childhood moving between Birmingham and Bournemouth and grew up listening to early popular UK garage releases such as DJ EZ's Pure Garage mix CDs, as well as local pirate radio stations. Whilst working in a record shop from the ages of 14 to 16, her boss, who was a DJ, encouraged her to start producing music on Ableton. Career After she had begun producing music, Gooding mostly made grime and hip-hop releases and uploaded them online. After messaging Wiley multiple times on Myspace in 2008, he asked her to send him some music. She sent him \\"Twenty-odd Beats\\", to which he replied that he was interested in some of them. The two then released multiple tracks together. This caused her to grow in reputation from other artists that she later worked with, such as Ghetts, Maxsta and Merky Ace. Multiple of her tracks were featured in the album release of the third iteration of long-standing grime 'clashing' event Lord of the Mics, hosted by Jammer. Eventually Gooding caught the attention of Butterz record label owners Elijah and Skilliam with her track \\"Hold On\\", a UK garage track that was a departure from some of the heavier music she was previously known for creating. The duo signed her up to the label to make her first real release \\"Hold On/Home\\" in 2011. This affiliation with Butterz would continue indefinitely and was the catalyst in her becoming a major musical artist, as it was with this connection that she learned how to DJ and gained regular radio airplay on established radio stations like Rinse FM and Kiss FM on which she at one point hosted a weekly show. With continued growth thanks to critically acclaimed releases such as her In the Dance EP which Resident Advisor stated was \\"so energetic that it's hard not to get sucked in\\", Flava D gained the attention of other artists making bassline and UK garage music and began working with fellow Butterz member Royal-T. The pair gained underground recognition with their track \\"On My Mind\\" which spawned multiple further remixes. Flava D released her first album More Love in 2015, which she deemed her \\"most personal project yet\\". This album was again critically acclaimed for emphasing the \\"sheer diversity within her style\\" by Clash, who also stated she had a \\"style all of her own\\". This would continue with further projects, including the release of a sequel album More Love 2, released for free digitally in January 2018. She released another project, Spicy Noodles EP in August of the same year on the Night Bass record label. In February 2020 it was announced that Flava D had signed to drum and bass label Hospital Records. Work with TQD TQD (often stylised as t q d or tqd) is a collaborative act that was formed in 2015, comprising Royal-T, DJ Q and Flava D, with the name TQD being an amalgamation of the last letter of each of their names. All three artists were already signed to the Butterz record label and thus all TQD releases have also been released on Butterz. The act play and produce the genres of music that the individuals do (such as UK garage, bassline and grime), however they have released experimental tracks that cross into many other genres. In 2015, Royal-T and DJ Q were collaborating on their first project together and they asked Flava D if she wanted to join in on the project too. This would then go on to be their debut single \\"Day and Night\\", released on Butterz on 18 April 2015, both digitally and as a limited 500 copy vinyl pressing. This track was released as \\"Day and Night (Day Mix)\\", however an alternate mix of the single was also released on the B-side as \\"Day and Night (Night Mix)\\". Due to their solo efforts and differences in location however, TQD releases were sparse with their second track titled \\"Ghosts\\" being previewed digitally over a year later in 2016 and then being released on their second vinyl release \\"Only One/Ghosts\\". The trio gained ample attention due to their releases and increasingly popular live sets and thus began working on an album together. This was formally announced at the beginning of 2017 to be a self-titled debut album, ukg, and would be released on 17 March 2017. The album contains features from P Money, Swindle and Skilliam and was met with generally positive reviews. Pitchfork called the track \\"Vibsing Ting\\" \\"strange and outstanding\\" and Mixmag said it consisted of \\"10 hard-hitting face melters\\". However, Clash magazine wrote that the album was \\"disappointingly short\\" and that \\"there‚Äôs a feeling that t q d aren‚Äôt really a case for three heads being better than one\\". The Bandcamp release of ukg contained three extra tracks that were not present on the vinyl or physical CD releases. Though they have not made any official releases since their debut album as a trio, each member continues to produce and release music individually and the act still performs shows in many countries around the world, including the United Kingdom, Spain and Japan.

Biography  McNaughton was born in the Isle of Islay, Argyllshire, Scotland and died in Salem, NY. His ancestral line is considered to have originated from early Pictish Kings in the 5th century. He married Mary MacDonald, the daughter of Sir Donald MacDonald, 3rd Baronet of Sleat (son of Sir James Mor Macdonald, 2nd Baronet) and Lady Mary Douglas (daughter of Sir Robert Douglas, tenth Earl of Morton). McNaughton‚Äôs wife was a descendant of John MacDonald, Lord of the Isles and Margaret Stewart (daughter of Robert II King of Scotland). McNaughton immigrated with his family first to New York City on September 22, 1738 and shortly thereafter, moved to Orange County, NY. He was amongst over 100 other immigrants from Scotland that were promised a large amount of land that was not initially provided to the immigrants. McNaughton successfully led the effort on March 2, 1764 to petition for 47,450 acres and became presiding trustee of the Argyle Patent. The land includes part of Fort Edward and Argyle. The settlers were known to have formed the town of Argyle, NY, where McNaughton became the first Justice of the Peace in the region. After riots broke out on October 29, 1771 in the region, McNaughton issued warrants for those involved, including Ethan Allen.

Hegg phptograph, Alaska Digital Archives It is a treacherous class 3 rapid river. The caption for an 1897 Frank La Roche photograph refers to it as the Lewes River and featured in En Route to the Klondike (1898) with text saying: \\"Skill, cool heads and hard work are the necessary requirements for navigating the rapids of the Lewes River. Here is portrayed an exciting scene, similar to which everyone who goes to the Klondike in the same way must experience. Partly guided by ropes in the hands of men ashore and steered clear of dangerous rocks by men in the boat, the frail craft dashes and struggles along, at one time miraculously escaping destruction in a wild eddy and at another time gliding gracefully between jagged rocks that rise threateningly out of the seething waters. There is no time to think - a sharp lookout and a steady hand are the only means to victory over the angry waters of the rapids one meets en route to the Klondike.\\" In 1898 the river had its moment in history, during the Klondike Gold Rush. After hauling their supplies to the top of the trail, prospectors waited for the ice to break up. On May 28, 1898 it happened and the rush was on. In the first 24 hours 800 boats left down the river, with a total 7,000 boats carrying around 20,000 men leaving in the next two weeks for Dawson City. After the initial rush to Dawson, Bennett stabilized into a major service centre for the thousands of mostly men who continued to pour North up the Chilkoot Trail. This prosperity was short lived though, as the White Pass and Yukon Route railway connecting Skagway, Bennett and Whitehorse was completed and navigating One Mile River was no longer needed. By 1901 the town of Bennett was in decline with some buildings moved away to be close to the railway station. Bennett was home to several hotels, including the Arctic (later New Arctic), which was co-owned by Friedrich Trump, grandfather of Donald Trump. By July 1900, the hotel and brothel was advertising in the local newspaper The Bennett Sun of being the ‚ÄúNewest, Neatest and Best Equipped North of Vancouver‚Äú. Trump amassed a small fortune in the Yukon, starting with his hotel and brothel in Bennett beside One Mile River. In 1901 Trump took his money back to New York and there started in the real estate business. The ghost town of Bennett, BC is a now tourist attraction.

The book was also reviewed by the philosopher Edward Erwin in Philosophy and Phenomenological Research. Gardner credited Cioffi with a \\"remarkable knowledge\\" of both Freud's work and scholarly literature about Freud. He credited Cioffi with criticizing Freud with \\"brilliant wit\\". Buccino praised Cioffi's discussion of Freud's theories of causality. Hutto credited Cioffi with raising interesting points, but questioned whether his views were fully consistent.

Installation of the cylindrical bus shelters began in 1975 and continued into the early 1990s. At least 477 were purchased, of which 455 remained in use by ACTION buses . Design The bus shelters were designed in 1974 for the National Capital Development Commission by the architect Clem Cummings. Cummings' design was for a cylindrical shelter made from concrete, with window frames on each side and a bench made from fibreglass. The windows were made from Lexan. ArchivesACT has stated that the design is an example of brutalist architecture. Various minor amendments were made to the design after the first series was installed; for instance, \\"Series II\\" shelters had a precast concrete floor and no backrest for the bench. The Series II shelters located near schools did not have a bench. Since they were first installed, the shelters have been painted cream colour, and their fibreglass window frames and benches have been orange. The shelters' Lexan windows proved to be a weak point. They were easily damaged by vandals, and could be pushed out of their frames or burnt. The ACT Transport Branch experimented with a different type of Lexan, but it also proved unsatisfactory. Consideration was given to using wire glass, but this option was rejected after glaziers advised the government that such windows would be more dangerous than Lexan if they were shattered. Efforts to replace damaged windows were eventually abandoned, and many of the shelters are now windowless. This has led to complaints about the shelters being cold and drafty. Installation A typical suburban bus stop with a concrete shelter in 2018. The shelter is angled so it faces towards oncoming buses. Unusually, this shelter retains both of its Lexan windows, but its fibreglass bench has been replaced with a wire bench. The first 98 \\"Series I\\" shelters were installed during 1975 as part of a broader project to upgrade Canberra's bus network. At this time it was intended that the shelters would eventually be installed at almost all bus stops in the city. Another 207 shelters were installed between the 1976‚Äì77 and 1979-80 financial years. Shelters continued to be sporadically purchased and installed during the 1980s and early 1990s. By the time construction was complete, at least 477 shelters had been installed. Bus shelters installed in Canberra since the early 1990s have been made from steel and glass. During the 1980s and 1990s murals were painted inside some of the bus shelters by school children and community groups; this effort was sponsored by ACTION as a way of discouraging vandalism and promoting community art. ACTION ran an annual mural painting competition between 1987 and at least 1992. By 1992, murals had been painted inside about 200 bus shelters. , 455 of the concrete bus shelters remained in use. A total of 64 of the shelters were relocated after 2007 when they were replaced with glass shelters which include advertising. Other shelters were relocated in the mid-2010s when ACTION's bus stops were upgraded to improve their accessibility for people with disability. The ACT Government intends to retain the shelters for as long as possible, with the Director of Capital Works at Transport Canberra and City Services telling the Australian Broadcasting Corporation in 2016 that \\"they just last forever because of the material they're made out of, [and] the way they're designed\\". Bus shelters at stops which will no longer be serviced following a planned major reform to ACTION routes in 2019 will be reinstalled elsewhere. Several concrete bus shelters built to Cummings' design have been installed outside of Canberra. Iconic status ArchivesACT has written that \\"over the years, the concrete shelters have become an admired element of Canberra's urban landscape\\" and they are \\"arguably Canberra's most endearing piece of urban architecture\\". The ABC and Canberra Times have described them as \\"iconic\\". They are often called \\"bunker\\" bus shelters by Canberrans. The artist Trevor Dickinson has become well known for his drawings of the shelters, created as part of a project to record all of them. An exhibition of Dickinson's work was hosted by the Canberra Museum and Gallery in 2018. An ACTION bus was also wrapped with some of Dickinson's drawings to coincide with the exhibition. Despite their iconic status, none of the concrete bus shelters have been heritage listed.

It was designed by Halligan & Wilton and built from 1908 to 1909. The property is owned by Property NSW, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002.  History  The Observer Hotel is built on the west side of George Street North on land which was, from 1788, part of the grounds of the prefabricated, temporary hospital. Although the site of the hotel is within the area occupied by the temporary hospital complex, no buildings are shown on either Hunter's initial survey or James Meehan's 1807 survey. In 1795 the land upon which the Observer Hotel was later to be constructed was leased to William Balmain. Balmain left the colony in 1801 but the next official lease of the land was not until 1810 when it was leased to William Gaudry who may have erected a building on the site. Gaudry had married the daughter of Henry Kable, a Sydney entrepreneur, and was part owner of the schooner Geordy with Henry Kable junior, as well as acting as an auctioneer and agent for his father-in-law. Gaudry's main property appears to have been near that of the Kables at Minto. The lease of the land in The Rocks was transferred to John Plummer in 1820. By 1824 Plummer was bankrupt and the lease was once again transferred, this time to James Johnston. A substantial two-storey house with a verandah, stables and stores was constructed on the site by the 1820s. This was the town residence of the Crown Solicitor Frederick Garling. The Garling family emigrated from London in 1815. Frederick Garling Jr., a noted maritime artist, painted a series of views of Sydney Harbour , one of which included his family residence which had recently been sold. In the early 1830s an attempt was made to formalise the leases but this grant was not formalised until October 1838, by which time the lot had been transferred to William Carr and George John Rodgers. Frederick Garling senior is likely to have been making plans to retire; his retirement was formally approved by the Governor in 1839. In addition to his townhouse Garling had been granted by Governor Macquarie in 1819. =Ownership by Frederick Unwin= Carr and Rodger's grant was then transferred to Frederick Wright Unwin, who was the claimant of the lot to the south. Unwin subdivided the property into a series of lots and erected the substantial sandstone stores just south of the site that survive today. A rear lane was created (now Kendall Lane). Garling's house is believed to have been demolished in 1844, shortly before the Waterman's Arms were constructed. Part of the house was revealed during archaeological excavations in the early 1990s. By 1810 there were 75 \\"licensed houses\\" in NSW, a number of which were located \\"on the Rocks\\", particularly fronting George Street North and in nearby Millers Point. Governor Macquarie soon restricted the number of licenses issued, one of which was obtained by Samuel Terry. It is partly due to the commercial subdivision of the lots claimed by Samuel Terry and Frederick Unwin and partly due to the proximity to the port and the bonded customs warehouses that George Street North developed a concentration of small public houses. Terry, a successful businessman, claimed allotments in The Rocks in the early 1830s which were finally granted in 1841. Running a hotel would appear to have been a lucrative business, the Observer Tavern was built in 1848 for Robert White Moore, the lessee of the original Fortune of War Hotel from 1840-46. =Development of the Observer Tavern= In the 1840s the block between Argyle Street and Mill Lane developed the character that it largely retains today. The building stock is predominantly Colonial Georgian commercial buildings. The pattern of use also remains similar; public houses interspersed with shops. Corner sites were favoured for public houses. The block still retains this pattern of development with the Orient Hotel on the southern corner and the Observer Hotel (which replaced the Waterman's Arms and the original Observer Hotel) on the northern corner. The Observer Tavern, as it was originally known, was built in 1848 for Robert White Moore who had purchased Lot 10 of Frederick Unwin's subdivision the year before. The adjacent Waterman's Arms having been built in 1844. The present Observer Hotel, built on a more substantial site than the original, dates from 1908‚Äì09 and straddles the sites of both the Waterman's Arms and the Observer Tavern. The Waterman's Arms reflects the numerous watermen who operated row boats on Sydney Harbour, the forerunner of the water taxi and the men may have gathered there waiting for a commission. In Sydney, before bridges were constructed, the easiest way to get to the lower North Shore was by rowboat and later by ferry. The Waterman's Arms was constructed of sandstone and is a more substantial building than the brick hotel constructed adjacent to it in 1848. Adjacent was yet another public house, almost identical in character to the Observer Tavern. The Moore family retained the ownership of the Waterman's Arms until the 1901 resumption. The two-storey six roomed building constructed as the Observer Tavern for Moore was built of brick walls with timber floors and a shingle roof. Up until 1852 the building was rated as a house rather than a public house. By 1851 a kitchen had been added to the roof, and the hotel is recorded as containing eight rooms. The origin of the name Observer Tavern is unknown, however the first stage of the Sydney Observatory on Observatory Hill, the time ball, was also built in 1848. It is not a common name for a public house. The first observatory in the Australian colonies had been erected on Dawes Point by William Dawes in 1788. J. M. Forde records John Speerin was the publican in the 1850s, and that the hotel was simply \\"within a door\\". The Observer was later operated by John Ferguson, with the adjacent P & O Hotel [Pacific and Orient] operated by his wife Mary. The photographs of the Observer Tavern in the SCC Demolition Books shows a sign reading \\"Fergusons\\" on the parapet, and the wording \\"Observer Tavern\\" painted on the brickwork below. The Fergusons continued to be the publicans until 1925. The Observer Tavern was for some years used as an unofficial coroner's court, before the construction of the Coroner's Court and Morgue in 1906. It was common practice in NSW to hold coronial inquests in public houses, although by law if there was a morgue or police station within one mile, it had to be used in preference. In 1856 a panel of jurors requested that the ventilation in the Circular Quay Dead House be improved. The use of the adjacent hotel was probably due to the stench of the bodies in an era when refrigerated morgues were unknown. =Redevelopment of the 'new' Observer Hotel= The Observer Tavern and the new Coroner's Court were both part of the extensive urban renewal in George Street North undertaken following the 1900 land resumptions. A series of plans survives that records the owners of the premises resumed. The former Waterman's Arms was owned by the Union Bank of Australia, the Observer Tavern was the estate of Arthur Malcolm Moore. The Sydney City Council demolition photographs show that a sandstone building on the corner of Mill Lane (No. 67 George Street North) was demolished before the Observer Tavern; and correspondence between F. Robertson and the Town Clerk survives from mid-1902. A record plan was prepared in December 1901 which indicates that the Waterman's Arms was one of the many substandard buildings identified for demolition by the Resumed Properties Branch. The demolition also allowed for the straightening and widening of Mill Lane, and the regularisation of the block fronting George Street North. In 1908 J. M. Forde reported in The Truth that: > The government has recently sold the Observer Tavern, with thirty feet > frontage and very little depth, an old house, for 3,000 pounds, or one > hundred pounds per foot. The house has for ages been a sort of Coroner's > Court, where short inquests were held. It will still be a sort of appendage > to coronial quests, as the new morgue and court are opposite. Weeping > friends can wet eye and whistle while awaiting coronial pleasure. Plans for the new \\"Observer Tavern Hotel\\" prepared by Halligan and Wilton on behalf of Tooth and Co. brewery were submitted to the Sydney City Council in March 1908. The Building Application plans no longer survive, however the watercoloured version of the plans submitted to the licensing board is amongst the hotel plans held at State Records, as are some of the other George Street North hotels. The plans for the new hotel were approved in May 1908. The ground floor included a bar, two parlours (one of which was for the residents), a dining room, pantry, kitchen, laundry, spirit store. A WC and also a large yard and a public urinal were accessible from Mill Lane. The dining room was also only accessible from the private entry and there was originally no connection into the public bar which fronted George Street North. Upstairs were a series of bedrooms, a sitting room, bathroom, WC and a linen cupboard. The Tooth's Yellow Card for the Observer Hotel records that the site, allotment 3 of Section of the Observatory Hill lands, was acquired by Tooth & Co. in January 1909 and they retained the premises until the land was once again resumed, this time by the Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority (SCRA), in December 1977. The approval to build a hotel had been obtained from the Liquor Licensing Board before the land transfer was formalised. The Fergusons continued to operate the public house once the new building had been completed. The date of re-opening of the Observer Hotel has not been determined, nor the builder identified. John Alexander Ferguson remained the publican until at least 1915, Mrs Victoria Elizabeth Ferguson taking over in 1923. In June 1920 Tooth's architect Mr. J. G. Dalzeil prepared a report noting that the following works to the site and building of the Observer Hotel were required: # Asphalt yard # Renovate private entrance, stair hall; staircase walls, ceilings and woodwork # Repair broken plaster on laundry walls # Repair concrete floor of laundry # Renovate bedrooms 7, 8 & 9, bath, WC, linen press, 1st Floor lobby # Renovate bedrooms 1, 3, 4 & 5 and repair plaster in Bed 2 on 2nd floor.24 The hotel was described as: > A three storey brick building of modern design and good appearance, > containing on the second floor five bedrooms, and on the first floor three > bedrooms, all of which are up to requirements, reasonably clean and > sufficiently furnished. One bathroom, W.C. and linen press are situated on > the first floor. The lessee might reasonably be requested to renovate the > same. On the ground floor there is a fairly large bar, good cellar, two > parlours, private entrance, dining room, kitchen and laundry, whilst at the > rear there is a storeroom, small stable, public lavatories and yard. The > building is generally clean and in good repair inside and out. The location of the small stable is not known. The publican wrote to Tooth & Co. informing them of the results of the inspection and that the Licensing Court required a second bathroom and that repairs to the exterior should be undertaken. A second bathroom (on the top floor) was not added until 1938. The hotel was painted in 1928, and by 1933 \\"the whole of the exterior of the main hotel building and all of the outhouses require painting\\". A fall off in trade occurred in the late 1920s when some of the shipping lines were no longer permitted to berth in Circular Quay. As noted in the Tooth & Co. archives: > The trade for 1928 has been showing a slight falling-off since the beginning > of the year. Mr Fyfe thinks this is due to a general depression in the > locality. He also thinks that the removal of the Commonwealth Line about six > months ago had a bearing on his trade. \\"Mr Fyfe said that the Matson Line > was shifted about 3 weeks ago and this made a difference of about 30 pounds > a week to his takings\\". The trade from the Matson Line was distributed > amongst the hotels of the area ie the Observer Tavern, Mercantile, Harbour > View and A.S.N. Co. The wharves had been shifted to the east side of > Circular Quay. Tooth's reduced Fyfe's rent twice and their files note that as he had been there since 1925 \\"it does not look like a case where we can charge him with incompetency\\". By 1930 there had been no improvement in trade, despite the hotel being \\"scrupulously clean\\" and being run on the \\"most economical lines\\". A handwritten note on the memo states \\"Fyfe is genuine and so is his wife, his letter should not be regarded as a try-on\\". In May 1932 Mr. Fyfe, was \\"a nervous wreck\\". Andrew Banks Fyfe was issued with a notice to quit in February 1933. His response was that he had: 'Worked and given all my energy for the last 3 years and all I have got is a bed, 3 meals and plenty of work and worry. This request of yours means I am to be turned out without a cent after all I have tried'. Despite Fyfe's request to remain Tooth's proceeded, however the comment written on Fyfe's letter reads: \\"The unfortunate part of the whole thing is that I really think Fyfe will finish up in the asylum\\". His fate is not known. The licence was then taken over by P. E. Goskin in March 1933, then Desmond Bush in August 1934, Oswald Algernon Bush in December 1938 and Nelson Grindal in 1943. Desmond Bush was fined on more than one occasion for supplying liquor during \\"prohibited hours\\". Tooths attempted to counter the impact of the Great Depression by appealing to a wider clientele, and the board room at the Kent Brewery still retained some of their art work from the 1930s depicting elegant women in evening wear. Similar examples of the advertising for Tooth's KB Lager from the late 1930s are held in the Powerhouse Museum, including sportswomen. The collection also includes a series of pub art signs commissioned for the Ship Inn at Circular Quay. The 1949 photograph on the Tooth's yellow cards shows a sign advertising XXX Ale and a smaller sign. The original pub signs did not survive in 1990. In late 1952 the warehouse immediately north of the Observer Hotel across the lane was destroyed by fire and the elevation to Playfair Lane (Mill Lane) was damaged, including the windows separated from the lane by the rear yard. The estimated cost of the works was ¬£240. The Insurance Company paid the claim. The publican believed that some of the internal rooms had been smoke damaged but Hellyer did not agree. =Resumption by the NSW Government= In 1960 the State Government invited developers to submit schemes for the redevelopment of the resumed area in The Rocks. All of the developers schemes were rejected by the Liberal State Government and the Chairman of the National Capital Development Commission Sir John Overall was appointed to prepare a report and planning scheme. To facilitate the proposed redevelopment the Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority was established. The Observer Hotel was resumed by the Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority in December 1970. Tooth & Co were granted a weekly tenancy and compensation was to be paid. The rental amount equalled the interest payable on the compensation due to Tooths. Tooths had been aware for some months that the resumption was to take place and did not wish to fund the publican's request for the roofing of the beer garden. By May 1971 the head lease was ready for execution. Tooth's were eventually paid $600,000 of the $1.1 million they had claimed. Their files recount that \\"we do not expect to get this amount\\". SCRA files note that: In 1971 Tooth's made it known that they were considering moving the licence out of The Rocks. Faced with the possibility of owning an unlicensed hotel building whose highest and best use was as a pub, the Authority decided in 1972/73 to purchase the licence for $75,000. An additional $30,000 was paid to the Tooths publican for \\"goodwill\\". This investment decision was made because: Advice indicated that the Licence Reduction Board would not be interested in creating a new licence for The Rocks, to replace that of the Observer, The Authority had always been of the opinion that The Rocks needed more low cost (hotel style) accommodation and the potential for an amplified hotel redevelopment was obvious even then. The decision to retain the hotel building appears to have been made in 1972/73. The SCRA report noted that the rooms were no longer being used as accommodation. In 1978 the Observer Hotel, the Kendall Lane precinct and the entire Rocks, as a conservation area, was listed on the (now defunct) Register of the National Estate. These listings follow on from listing on the non- statutory National Trust of Australia register, including The Rocks Urban Conservation Area listing of May 1978. By 1990 the nature of operating a pub in The Rocks had changed. No longer were the hotels the exclusive watering holes of the working class residents and waterside workers. By day The Rocks had become a major tourist Mecca and, by night, it had become renowned as a major night-time area for young people. Remains of previous buildings on the site were uncovered during the conservation works of September 1991. Soon after excavation work commenced on site for the additions to the cellar, remains of the south wall of the Waterman's Arms Hotel and the north wall of the Observer Tavern were uncovered. The cellars of both buildings were uncovered and a drain running along the north boundary of the old Waterman's Arms Hotel was discovered. In 2000, the licensee of the Observer Hotel, Jim Doughan, engaged Misho & Associates, architects to prepare plans for the expansion of the hotel into the neighbouring property (No. 71 George Street North) where a kitchen and bistro were constructed. In 2006 a historic mural painted on the rear wall of the hotel by artist Helen Davies received an Energy Australia National Trust Heritage Awards for Highly Commended Interpretation and Presentation.  Description  The three-storey brick hotel building is in the Federation Free Style. There is a wide awning to the building. The first and second storeys have central recessed balconies dominated above by a pediment in the parapeted roofline. The hotel is constructed with a flexible non load bearing partition system. It is finished with cement render.Collingridge 1976 Despite a number of alterations, the hotel is remarkably intact on the first and second floors and the original layout and most of the details are discernible and retrievable on the ground floor. = Modifications and dates = * 1929: The first major alterations made to the hotel was the removal of the post-supported verandah over the footpath and its replacement with a Wunderlich metal cantilevered awning. * 1937: Creation of a private sitting room for the licensee and his family (a store room becoming the laundry, the laundry becoming the kitchen, the kitchen becoming the new sitting room). * 1938: An additional bathroom and lavatory.Robertson & Hindmarsh 1990: 7-10, 21-22 * 1991-92: Conservation work was undertaken involving the internal and external restoration of the main three storey building facing George Street, the modification of the existing rear wing, and the construction of a new courtyard room adjacent to the rear wing facing Mill Lane. The existing basement and cold room cellar were enlarged and the toilets relocated to the rear of the property. Archaeological remains were preserved and the design of the rear additions enabled their viewing by the public. The hotel was reopened in August, 1992.SCRA 1992: 18  Heritage listing  The Observer Hotel and site are of State heritage significance for their aesthetic, historical and scientific cultural values. The site and building are also of State heritage significance for their contribution to The Rocks area which is of State Heritage significance in its own right. The Observer Hotel demonstrates the extensive urban renewal undertaken in The Rocks in the post-plague era and is a reasonably well- preserved example of a small hotel. Of the five rebuilt hotels to survive only three retain evidence of their interior configuration. Despite a number of alterations, the Observer Hotel is remarkably intact on the first and second floors, indicating the residential character of the upper floors. The original layout and some of the details, including Art Nouveau style detailing, are reasonably discernible on the ground floor although much of the original fabric and all the spaces, with the exception of the stairwell, have been demolished. The Observer Hotel, which boldly addresses the corner of George Street North and Mill Lane in the Federation Free Style, contributes to the historic and architectural diversity of the George Street North streetscape. The series of footpath awnings along George Street North reflects social and legislative changes regarding shelter of footpaths and society's changing attitude towards the authenticity of recreating supposed \\"original\\" detail. The hotel is one of three similarly styled and sized hotels designed by Halligan and Wilton in Sydney and it is the most intact of those three. Observer Hotel was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Observer Hotel demonstrates the rebuilding of the Rocks in the post-plague era. It is a reasonably well-preserved example of a small, formerly one bar, hotel. It demonstrates changing drinking habits by the gradual expansion of the drinking facilities and loss of Women's and Guest's Parlours. It embodies a fragment of The Rocks social history by virtue of the need to protect patrons by incorporating internally supervised lavatories. It embodies changes to The Rocks in the loss of its residential component. It represents changes in laws governing accommodation on licensed premises by virtue of the new (1950s) second floor bathroom and WC. It is an important functioning remnant of the many hotels which once dotted The Rocks. The series of footpath awnings along George Street North reflects social and legislative changes regarding shelter of footpaths and society's changing attitude towards the authenticity of recreating supposed \\"original\\" detail. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The substantial urban renewal of The Rocks and Millers Point would appear to be the most extensive scheme undertaken in Australia in its day. The rebuilding of the hotels indicates that the impact of the Temperance movement, which sought to limit the number of liquor outlets in order to reduce alcohol consumption, had yet to be felt. The site is associated with the Garling family and Fredrick Garling, a marine artist in particular. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The Observer Hotel, which boldly addresses the corner of George Street North and Mill Lane, contributes to the historic and architectural diversity of the George Street North streetscape. It is also an excellent example of Federation Free Style architecture in its own right. It is an excellent example of the hotel work of architects, Halligan & Wilton, and is one of the better preserved examples of their work. The hotel is one of three similar hotels designed by the partners in Sydney. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The site of the Observer Hotel, as revealed in the conservation work of 1991, contains the below ground remains of the former buildings on the site and has the potential for further archaeological investigation in the future. The changes in the layout of the hotel are well documented in the surviving sequence of documentary evidence. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The use of Art Nouveau detailing in the Observer Hotel, including the fa√ßade lettering and the pressed metal dado, is a rare surviving example of the introduction of the Art Nouveau style to Sydney widely promoted by Liberty's. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The Observer Hotel is a well-preserved example of a small, originally one bar, hotel. Despite a number of alterations, the hotel is remarkably intact on the first and second floors. The original layout and some of the details are reasonably discernible on the ground floor although much of the original fabric and all the spaces, with the exception of the stairwell, have been demolished.

It was built during 1908. It is now part of the modern Duty Free Store complex. The property is owned by Property NSW. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002.  History  As indicated by James Meehan's survey of 1807, this site was first occupied by Surgeon General John White at Lot No.4 and Captain William Raven at Lot No. 5. In Mrs Underwood was the owner of three storey stone shops and houses each with seven rooms. By 1845 a two-storey brick house and shop with a shingle roof and five rooms was built. Also on this same allotment at the corner of George and Globe Streets a two-storey stone and brick house and store was erected. The five roomed house had \\"every convenience\\". In 1861 this building was used as a \\"Bowling Alley\\" managed by William Ogilvie. In 1871 in the tenements erected by Underwood, a Public House was opened. The Inn was called the \\"Nil Desperandum Hotel\\". By 1882 three two storey tenements were erected between the butcher shop and the brick and stone shop on the north side of the Public House, then known as the New York Hotel. These shops and dwelling were constructed of brick and they were roofed in iron. In 1891 the building to the south corner of Globe and George Streets was pulled down. By 1891 George McEvoy had erected houses to the Harrington Street frontage. The four storey buildings were of brick and stone and the roofs were slated. In these houses were pulled down. In 1892 a three-storey brick and slate roofed shop and dwelling was erected for the Trustees of the Church of England to 145 George Street. In 1900 the area was resumed under the Observatory Hill Resumption Act. In the New York Hotel was demolished and by 1908 Tooth & Co. Ltd. erected the brick and iron roofed building to 153-155 George Street. In 1912 the tenements to 149 and 151 George Street were pulled down, and in the same year a two-storey brick office building was erected to the rear of 145 George Street. During 1913 Quay Chambers at 149-151 George Street were erected. The tenement to 147 George Street was demolished in 1914 and in that same year the present three-storey brick building was erected. The New York Theatre was erected at 157-159 George Street in 1914 by Nathan Jacobs. It was demolished in 1937. This site was acquired by the Public Transport Commission in 1946 and the City Circle Railway was opened in 1956. The hotel ceased operation 1960. The Cahill Expressway had opened directly adjacent to the hotel in 1958. In the late 1980s a large commercial building, now known as the DFS Complex, was erected behind 145-155 George Street with the removal of most of the interior and the adaptation of the facades of the buildings involving mostly new shopfronts.  Description  The brick and stucco building was constructed in 1908 and is a good example of what has been described as Federation Free Style architecture. It has two major elements, a five-storey tower section and a lower three storey section splayed at a slight angle to follow the change in the alignment of George Street. The building features elements typical of the style in its tower design and the art nouveau and classical motifs in the arched entablature over the balconies of both sections.Godden Mackay 1996: 10 The remaining heritage fabric is in good physical condition.  Heritage-listing  As at 30 March 2011, the former New York Hotel at 153-155 George St was constructed in 1908 for Tooth & Co Ltd, and has State heritage significance for its historical and scientific cultural values. The subject site has historic significance at State level for having been the site of early European settlement and continuously occupied by Europeans since 1788. The site has historic associations with three phases of 20th century urban renewal. The first phase of development followed the 1900 plague outbreak, a period of considerable rebuilding in The Rocks, when the building on the site was demolished and rebuilt under the Observatory Hill Resumption Act. The second phase is associated with infrastructure works, when the construction of the Cahill Expressway and the City Railway link, immediately south of the subject site, dramatically changes the building's curtilage. The third phase of construction is associated with the 1980s creation of The Rocks as a tourist destination, when the interior and rear of the building was changed considerable to accommodate a duty-free store. The subject site has high historic significance at local level for its associations with its use as a hotel form 1873 to 1960: the Nil Desperandum Hotel (1873-1880) and the New York Hotels (1882-1907 and 1908-1960). Physical evidence of its function as a hotel has been lost. The subject site has high scientific/research significance at State level associated with the archaeological potential of early structures of the Underwood Building and shop located on or near the site. Potential archaeological remnants could exist beneath the building and date to early settlement of the colony. The East Elevation of the former New York Hotel has high aesthetic significance at local level associated with being a representative example of a Federation Free Style commercial building designed in the 1st decade of the 20th century. In the 1980s the rear elevation, much of the ground floor and upper floor interiors, shopfronts and street awnings were altered. While this has reduced the ability to interpret the building's significance, the eastern fa√ßade contributes to the aesthetic and historic diversity of the George St streetscape. The former New York Hotel forms part of a group of four commercial buildings (Nos 145,147, 149-151 and 153-155 George St) which front George St and form the eastern portion of the DFS (Duty Free Store) Complex. This group of buildings bounded by Globe St and the Cahill Expressway mark George St's southern entry to The Rocks precinct. The facades of the four late 19th century and early 20th century buildings have streetscape qualities and character that contribute to the overall richness of a coherent and harmonious brick and stucco group of buildings located within The Rocks. The significance of the subject site and the group is associated with its location in The Rocks, a precinct unique to NSW and its historic associations and streetscape character and qualities that contribute to The Rocks area which has State heritage significance in its own right. The group is an important part of The Rocks Heritage Conservation Area being sympatric in scale and character and an extension of the remaining earlier buildings of George St, presenting a unified streetscape. The buildings are tangible evidence of the redevelopment of The Rocks in the 1900s. The former New York Hotel has high social significance as a contributory element associated with the historic character of The Rocks, which is held in esteem by the community. The former New York Hotel was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. 153-155 George St has exceptional significance at State level for its associations as a built element within George St. George St was the first road created in the settlement of NSW and thus the oldest road in the country. The history of George St (North) and its uses and changes since 1788, illustrate and inform the aspirations and way of life of Europeans in Australia. George St (North) is historically significant because it shows the continuity of European settlement in this area. Since its creation George St (North) has had numerous alignments and widenings. The subject site reflects the angle in the alignment of the road along it George St frontage. The design and form of both the site and the building expresses this alignment. 153-155 George St has high significance at local level for its associations with an historic phase, the first decade of the 20th century, when the urban development of The Rocks was impacted by the plague of 1900. The Observatory Hill Resumption Act resulted in the resumption of large tracts of land. Post plague redevelopment of The Rocks saw the demolition of a large number of buildings and the construction of new buildings that met health standards and requirements. This included the demolition of the New York Hotel in 1907 and the construction of the replacement New York Hotel in 1908 by owners, Tooth & Co Ltd. 153-155 George St has high significance at local level associated with hotels and public houses continuously operating on the site for almost 90 years. Hotels operating on the site included the Nil Desperandum Hotel from 1873-1880 and the New York Hotel from 1882-1960. These hotels were among the numerous similar premises that gave The Rocks its unique character, recognisable in the 1880s until the 1960s with fewer public houses operating as such today. 153-155 George St has moderate significance at local level for its associations with urban changes in The Rocks including the construction of the Sydney Harbour Bridge and associated transport infrastructure, in particular the Cahill Expressway and the City Rail link to Circular Quay. Buildings adjoining the subject site to the south were demolished to make way for infrastructure which severed The Rocks precinct from the central business district. 153-155 George St has moderate significance at local level for its associations with the phase of redevelopment of The Rocks in the 1980s when the precinct was transformed into a major tourist attraction. The item meets this criterion at State level. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The East Elevation of 153-155 George St has high significance at local level as a representative example of a commercial building in the Rocks designed in the Federation Free Style. The East Elevation expresses the change of alignment of George St through the expression of the tower structure. The building at 153-155 George St has high significance at local level associated with the intactness of external elements and the retention of early 20th century streetscape elements conserved with the building group between Globe St and the Cahill Expressway. 153-155 George St has high significance at local level associated with a group of buildings with landmark qualities. On entering the precinct from George St this group of buildings is the gateway to The Rocks. The scale of the group of buildings between the Cahill Expressway and Globe St contrast with the modernist brutalism of the Cahill Expressway and the 20th century modernist buildings located within George St south of the Cahill Expressway, Circular Quay and the city generally. The backdrop of the DFS buildings does not diminish the picturesque quality of the group. The West Elevation of 153-155 George St is a fa√ßade designed as part of the 1980s development and as such contributes to the loss of design integrity. The interior of the building was removed in the 1980s development and little evidence of the architectural planning or fabric is retained internally. The item meets this criterion at local level. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Rocks has considerable significance to the people of Sydney and NSW as a heritage precinct. The fight to \\"Save The Rocks\\" was a significant battle for local residents and the community. The Rocks is a highly visited tourist area. It is visited by both local and international tourists and Sydney-siders who go to the area for its historic character and associations as a remnant of the area first settled in Sydney. The Rocks, of which the subject site forms part is important to the community's sense of place. As an element within The Rocks, 153-155 George St, provides a sense of place that is integral to The Rocks as a whole and is subsequently held in esteem by the community. The item meets this criterion at State level. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The earliest and most substantial phase of building on the subject site and in its close proximity occurred by 1822. These earliest buildings, located along the George St frontage, comprised the Underwood Building, an adjacent shop to the north and Thomas Moore's house. The impact of the site on these very large, multi-storeyed, well constructed, brick and stone buildings would have been extensive and it is highly probable that intact evidence still remains in the archaeological record. In the case of the Underwood Building and adjacent shop this evidence is likely to be found beneath the existing building or in the immediate vicinity of them. Archaeological evidence on the southern section of the site has probably been removed by later developments. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The former New York Hotel is one of a group of hotel buildings that operated in The Rocks from the end of the 19th century until the mid 20th century. With the reduced need for public houses many of these pubs have been adaptively reused for retail and office purposes. The item, 153-155 George St is a representative example of this group. The item meets this criterion at local level.

The archaeological site of a total area of 180 acres is located at an altitude of 220 meters, 7 kilometers northeast of Patras, has been transformed into a recreational park. It includes 78 carved tombshttp://www.patrasport.gr/cms/?page_id=146‚ü®=en and the ruins of a prehistoric settlement, possibly identified with that of ancient Mesatishttp://monuments.hpclab.ceid.upatras.gr/places.php?place=79‚ü®=2. First archaeological excavations began in 1923 by Nikolaos Kyparissis. Many of the findings such as vases, clay statuettes, bronze artifacts, tools, weapons and jewellery have been transported and exhibited at the nearby Archaeological Museum of Patras. Settlement The prehistoric settlement of Voudeni, lasting approximately five hundred years (1500‚Äì1050 BC), was one of the most prominent regional sites of the periphery of the Mycenaean world. Due to the natural fortification and hiding provided by the Bortzi hill at the foot of Mt. Panachaiko, the settlement was the center of a wider set of smaller settlements developed in the surrounding lowland areas. Geographical position played an important role in the establishment and development of the settlement, as it provided observation of the sea as well as an easy escape route to the mountains in case of an emergency or danger. A natural harbor located at the present day marsh of Agyia, provided access to the sea, allowing control of the entire gulf of Patras. Also, the rich and fertile stretches of land could provide sufficient agricultural and livestock products for the self-sufficiency of the community. The existence of a soft soil allowed the creation of a cemetery southeast of the settlement on the hillside (Amygdalia position), to the west of the present day settlement of Voudeni.

Most of the explored graves were carved in circular, square, horseshoe or quadrilateral form with a dome, of varying dimensions often housing multiple burials. Some of the largest tombs are number 4 and 75, which are presumed to belong to officials or community lords due to their large size. All of the tombs revealed objects of everyday life, such as vases, jewellery, tools, weapons and utensils, that prove the prosperity and commercial relations of the localshttp://www.thebest.gr/news/index/viewStory/329053.

ISC's mandate is to work \\"collaboratively with partners to improve access to high quality services for First Nations, Inuit and M√©tis.\\" The department was created in 2019 following the dissolution of Indian Affairs and Northern Development Canada.  Restructuring of the Former Indian Affairs and Northern Development Canada  In August 2017, the Trudeau government announced the dissolution of Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada and announced that it will be replaced by Indigenous Services Canada (ISC) and Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada (CIRNAC). This came into effect as of July 15, 2019. The transition was not instantaneous, with Orders-in-Council initially separating the portfolios, and formal legislation constituting the new departments being passed in July 2019. According to Trudeau, the rationale behind the restructuring was that \\"the structures in place at Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada were created at a time where the approach around the Indian Act, the approach around our engagement with indigenous peoples, was very much looked at in a paternalistic, colonial way\\". The new departments are consistent with the 1996 Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples' recommendations to improve the delivery of services dramatically and fast- track self-government.

The amount available to each community through the First Nations Infrastructure Fund (FNIF) was limited to a total of $10 million over a five-year period. By March 2008, a total of 262 proposals (out of the 714 submitted) were approved for FNIF funding. Nationally, $94.3 million of FNIF funding was dispersed.

It was built in 1839 and significantly rebuilt 1890-91. The property is owned by Property NSW. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002.  History  The site of 91 and 93 George Street was the site of the Assistant Surgeon's House, constructed shortly after the arrival of the First Fleet in 1788. The location of this residence relates to the location of the Colony's first hospital just to the south of the site. Once a more substantial hospital was constructed in Macquarie Street in 1816, the Assistant Surgeon no longer required the house. =Occupation by Francis Greenway= From about that time, the former Assistant Surgeon's house was occupied by Francis Greenway, a ticket-of-leave man who had been transported for forgery in 1814. Greenway was appointed to the position of civil architect and assistant engineer for the government in 1816, for which his salary included lodging quarters. This appointment ceased in 1822, however, Greenway refused to relinquish his government house. He produced a document (later claimed to be a forgery) purporting to give him title to the land. He appears to have continued to occupy the site until at least 1834, when the title was questioned and ownership reverted to the Crown. However, it was not until Greenway's death in 1837 that the Crown recovered the property, following action in London. =Acquisition by Frederic Unwin= Frederic Wright Unwin, solicitor and merchant, was subsequently granted the land in 1838. Unwin had extensive landholdings in the city, particularly along the western side of George Street. Lease to Michael Gannon On 1 July 1839, Unwin leased an area of land to Michael Gannon, carpenter, for a period of 21 years. Gannon had arrived in the colony as a convict on the Almorah in 1820 and was granted a conditional pardon in 1835. The terms of the lease required that Gannon: 'shall and will within a reasonable time and within two years at the furthest build and erect on the line of frontage to George Street as many houses as will occupy the said frontage of such dimensions as said Michael Gannon may think fit so as such houses are of three stories exclusive of cellars and built substantially and of good materials.' It is unclear from the documentary evidence whether the Assistant Surgeon/Greenway's house had been demolished by the time Gannon took on the lease. However, by 1844, when the land was conveyed to R. A. A. Morehead and Matthew Young, Gannon had constructed a number of buildings on the land, including the New York Hotel at 91 George Street and a three-storey building at 93 George Street, as well as the terrace located at Nos. 95-99 George Street. Although Gannon was only required to erect buildings along the George Street frontage, the plan accompanying the conveyance in 1844 shows that the site also contained buildings along Argyle Street, and a workshop and stables accessible from the yard, all also presumed to be constructed by Gannon. The resulting configuration of the block was typical of urban planning in other quarters in The Rocks, that of a central yard, accessed through a passageway, and surrounded by buildings open to the public fronting the adjacent streets, as well as workshops or factory buildings opening primarily to the yard. Gannon was also responsible for the creation of the laneway (now known as Greenway Lane) accessing the yard from Argyle Street. =Conversion as a hotel= The hotel at 91 George Street was constructed within 12 months of Gannon's acquiring the 21 year lease of the site, as he was granted a licence for the New York Hotel, George Street, in 1840. Later listings in the Sands Directory confirm that the New York Hotel was situated at the corner of George and Argyle Streets. In 1845, the hotel was described as \\"stone and shingle three- storey hotel of 15 rooms\\" and the building then at 93 George Street was described as a \\"shop with 6 rooms.\\" Sands Directory listings for the site show that the New York Hotel operated as such until 1861, while the building at 93 George Street was a seaman's boarding house. Michael Gannon died , having been declared insolvent in 1845. The insolvency records list Gannon's address as Argyle Street, and his occupation as builder. In the early 1860s, the uses of both buildings changed. While 93 George Street became a green grocer, 91 George Street was used by Henry Fisher & Son, ship brokers, as a warehouse. By 1866, however, use of the building reverted to a hotel under John B. Bassetti, who operated the Italian Hotel. In 1869, the name of the hotel was changed to the Liverpool Arms, as is evident in the earliest clear photographic evidence about the site. This 1875 photograph shows the building at 91 George Street in its original incarnation as a Georgian style hip-roofed building. The building on the site of 93 George Street is a three-storey building with a similar appearance to the hotel building adjacent. In 1870, the land containing 91 and 93 George Street was sold to William Yeoman, painter, and who, from the 1860s, owned the land at 95-101 George Street. After a period as the American Hotel, 91 George Street became the 'ASN Co's Hotel' in 1879. Yeoman occupied a store which was constructed by Gannon as a workshop in the yard behind George Street. In 1885, Yeoman sold the land to John Gill. On 26 February 1890, the City Building Surveyor, George MacRae, wrote to the City of Sydney Improvement Board to alert the Board to the premises at 93 George Street which was 'in a ruinous condition and dangerous to the public.' The agent for the owner, John Lord, told the Committee: > 'The house has been let on lease, in conjunction with the Tooth & Co, it is > let with the hotel to Joseph Davis the Hotelkeeper at the corner, next door > to No. 93, which he sublets. The lease of both the hotel and house No. 93 > will expire about the 23rd or 24th of April next, or toward the end of that > month; I have been in treaty with Tooth and Co. for a renewal of the lease, > and for effecting all necessary repairs and alterations, but the matter is > in abeyance for a while, owing to their not being able to find a suitable > tenant; as soon as the matter is settled it is proposed to expend ¬£300 or > ¬£400 upon the premises, that is both the hotel & the dwelling house. Coward > & Bell, architects, have been employed to draw up specifications for > necessary repairs etc.' The Board resolved that the building be \\"taken down [condemned] forthwith\\". In so resolving, the Chairman of the Board asked the City Building Surveyor if the hotel adjoining the premises this day inspected was proposed to be dealt with, the Board having noticed that it appeared to be in a bad condition. The Surveyor responded that 'he had looked over the hotel building but it was not nearly in so bad a condition as the premises No. 93 George Street. He would, however, shortly make a more minute inspection as to its safety, when the building now condemned was taken down he would have a better opportunity of doing so.' Although the documentary evidence does not indicate when the Board's order was carried out, the physical evidence suggests that 93 George Street was demolished and rebuilt as a two-storey with cellar shop, and that 91 George Street was substantially rebuilt at the same time, shortly after the Board's order in 1890. As both buildings were under one ownership, and both buildings were leased to Tooth & Co, it is likely that the rebuilding of the pair was carried out in a single event, resulting in the shared decorative features evident in early 20th century photographs of the buildings, including the garland decoration to the parapets. It appears that the upper floors of 91 George Street were extended toward the west and built over Greenway Lane during this substantial rebuilding. The Sands Directory contains no listing for either building in 1891, possibly as both buildings were under construction at the time. When listed again in 1892, the ASN Hotel was under a new licensee, R. B. Goof, and 93 George Street housed O'Neill & Co, outfitters. O'Neill & Co remained in the building until 1907, when it became refreshment rooms. The ASN Hotel continued to operate as a hotel tied to Tooth & Co, under a number of different sub-leases, for most of the 20th century. =Resumption by the NSW Government= Following the outbreak of bubonic plague in Sydney's waterfront areas in 1900, the property was turned over to the Crown as part of the resumption of the entire Rocks area. Following this resumption, the Maritime Services Board administered leases of 91 and 93 George Street until 12 January 1970, when ownership was taken over by the Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority. Alterations to the hotel building at 93 George Street took place in 1912, 1922, and in 1928-9. During the latter 20th century, the Licensing Court and Police issued several notices to carry out repairs to the ASN Hotel. The hotel continued to accommodate a varying number of lodgers during this time. A 1955 internal Tooth & Co. report gives an understanding of the character of the Hotel and its lodgers: > 'The Hotel is exceedingly old, the area is on the waterfront, and the > lodgers are working men, and it is hard under these conditions to keep the > rate of depreciation down the walls should be oiled in lieu of water painted > or papered, so that they could be washed down.' By the 1970s, the ASN Hotel was trading poorly in comparison to other hotels in The Rocks under Tooth & Co supervision. A 1974 report stated that the ASN Hotel sold \\"10 kilderkins [5 barrels] and 20 dozens of packaged beer\\" per week, while the other four Tooth's hotels in The Rocks (Fortune of War Hotel, Mercantile Hotel, Australian Hotel, and Glenmore Hotel) averaged 60 kilderkins (30 barrels) and 115 dozens of packaged beer on a weekly basis. In 1976, Tooth's terminated its head lease with the Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority and hotelkeepers began to lease their premises directly from the Authority. The ASN Hotel ceased trading on 26 January 1983 and the NSW Public Works Department subsequently commenced substantial renovations and refurbishment in order to convert the building into a police station. All traces of the 1920s renovations were removed, and the building was given a Victorian Italianate- style appearance, based on photographic evidence of its earlier appearance. The police station opened on 20 December 1983, and operated from the site until 1998 when it moved across George Street to the former NSW Department of Labour and Industry Building at 132-134 George Street. Since that time the hotel building has housed a range of tenants, the most recent as a chocolate shop.  Description  The building is a three storied, brick built and cement rendered former hotel in the Victorian Italianate style.Clive Lucas Stapleton and Partners Pty Ltd, 1999. It has an unusual garland decoration below the parapet and a large cartouche (oval scrolled plaque) on the first floor splayed corner. The building was extensively altered by Tooth & Co.; in 1928. In 1983 the building was again extensively remodelled to function as a police station: the 1929 detailing was removed and the 1890s Italianate details reconstructed. A considerable extent of the early (to 1928) fabric has been lost, but the existing fabric is in good condition. = Modifications and dates = Facade: 1891; 1928; 1983; Repainted 1999. There have been several internal modifications over time, including alterations to the bar configuration, and use of rooms and modifications to allow updating of services. In 2007 it underwent refurbishment, painting and fitout for the chocolate shop.  Heritage listing  The former ASN Co. Hotel and site at 91 George Street, The Rocks, is of State heritage significance for its aesthetic, historical and scientific cultural values, and its contribution to The Rocks area, which is of State Heritage significance in its own right. The building, originally designed as a hotel that spans a lane and addresses the two main thoroughfares of The Rocks (George and Argyle Streets), is a fine, rare, example of a Victorian Italianate-style corner building. The only Victorian Italianate-style hotel building in The Rocks, it contributes to the aesthetic diversity of The Rocks streetscape. The site is historically significant as a site continuously occupied by Europeans since 1788. It has associations with the first Assistant Surgeon Dr William Redfern as his house was the first structure on the site, later occupied by the first colonial architect Francis Greenway. The building is historically significant as the only extant Victorian Italianate-style hotel building in The Rocks. The building is socially significant for its long history as a hotel, meeting place and residence for working men on the waterfront. The site is technically significant for the archaeological potential to reveal evidence of earlier configurations of the hotel structures and road surfaces and even the earlier building occupied by Greenway and the Assistant Surgeon. The site has scientific significance for the archaeological potential to reveal evidence of earlier configurations of the hotel structures, road surfaces and earlier buildings on the site. The building is socially significant for its long history, enjoyed as a pub for many decades up to 1983, and for its contribution to The Rocks area, Australia's premier heritage precinct. ASN Hotel Building was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The site of 91 and 93 George Street is historically significant as a site continuously occupied by Europeans since 1788. The configuration of the buildings and Greenway Lane is historically significant in demonstrating the approach to urban planning prevalent in The Rocks . No. 91 George Street and the original building at 93 George Street were constructed contemporaneously, together with the buildings at 45-47 Argyle Street and 94-99 George Street, by Michael Gannon under the terms of his lease of the land, imparting this group of buildings with a shared origin and history. Further, 91 and 93 George Street are linked by their common subsequent ownership and operation (with 93 George Street functioning at times as a boarding house associated with the hotel at 91 George Street). Additionally, the construction of the current building at 93 George Street in 1890 was accompanied by the substantial rebuilding of the hotel at 91 George Street, resulting in a number of decorative features shared between the two buildings. The former ASN Hotel at 91 George Street is of historical significance as a company sponsored hotel, associated with the Australasian Steamship Navigation Company, which was a prominent transport company in 19th century NSW, operating transport between Sydney and the Hunter district from the 1851. The former ASN Hotel at 91 George Street meets this criterion on a State level.Clive Lucas Stapleton and Partners Pty Ltd, 2006 The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The site of 91 and 93 George Street is of significance for its association with the First Fleet, as the site of the house of the Assistant Surgeon from . The Assistant Surgeon's residence is also associated with the first colonial architect, Francis Greenway, who lived in a house on the site between 1815 and . The original buildings on the site, although demolished and rebuilt (no. 93) and substantially rebuilt (no. 91) in 1890, are associated with Michael Gannon, a ticket-of-leave convict who made a living as a builder in The Rocks, developing a substantial parcel of land, including the subject site, from 1839. Gannon is an interesting example of the mid-19th century class of pardoned convicts who remained in NSW and practiced trades or professions. The former ASN Hotel at 91 George Street meets this criterion on a State level. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. 91 and 93 George Street, as a pair, are aesthetically significant as a fine example of the Victorian Italianate style, characterised by the unusual garland decoration below the parapet (both buildings) and the decorative cartouche located on the splayed corner of 91 George Street. 91 George Street is aesthetically significant for its prominent contribution to the streetscape at the intersection of the two main streets in The Rocks, George and Argyle Streets. Both 91 and 93 are significant as contributors to the visual diversity of the streetscape. Both buildings are aesthetically significant for their contribution to the streetscape of Greenway Lane, one of the pedestrian laneways in The Rocks area which are highly significant as evocations of the colonial townscape. The former ASN Hotel at 91 George Street meets this criterion on a State level. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The buildings are socially significant for their long history and for their contribution to The Rocks area, Australia's premier heritage precinct, as evidenced by their inclusion on a number of lists of buildings of heritage significance formulated by community groups such as the National Trust of Australia (NSW), and representative bodies such as the City of Sydney Council and the Heritage Council of NSW. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The site is technically significant for the archaeological potential to reveal evidence of earlier configurations of the hotel structures and road surfaces as well as the structure occupied by the First Fleet's Assistant Surgeon and later by Francis Greenway. The former ASN Hotel at 91 George Street meets this criterion on a State level. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The building is a rare example of a Victorian Italianate-style hotel in The Rocks. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The former ASN Hotel at 91 George Street is representative of hotel buildings in The Rocks in terms of its fabric, size, series of renovations, and historical uses.

She married Johan Lohe (1643-1704) in 1673, with whom she had eighteen children. Her husband was one of the richest people in Sweden and managed a trading company, a shipping business, a sugar refinery and ironworks. However, he became most known for his banking business as a moneylender, by which he acquired an enormous fortune and counted the king of Sweden among his clients; he was ennobled in 1703. In 1704, Anna Lohe was widowed and took over the business of her late husband, including his banking business and his net of clients among the nobility and court. She was forced to defeat a contest of the will by her children, but won after four years. Considering the constant and growing great wealth of the family, she was evidently very successful. Anna Lohe was thus a prominent businesswoman and a powerful figure within Swedish financial life at the time, however, she is not often publicly mentioned. The Lohe banking family, in general, had a bad reputation and was described as \\"greedy, suspicious and not very scrupulous\\". She lived with her two unmarried children Adolf Lohe (1683‚Äì1759) and Johanna Lohe (1690‚Äì1759) on Lilla Nygatan until her death. After her death, a new inheritance dispute took place between her children for six years before it was settled. It was likely Adolf and Johanna Lohe who hid the great Lohe Treasure, a collection of gold and silver, under the floor of the house during the Dalecarlian rebellion (1743), which was famously excavated in 1937.

Several were praised for exhibiting realism and originality. She published her first work in 1884. Family and education Lanza was born Clara Hammond in Fort Riley, Kansas, the daughter of William A. Hammond, a physician who served as the Surgeon General of the United States Army during the second half of the American Civil War, and his first wife, Helen Nisbet. When she was seven, her family moved to New York City. After attending a French school in New York, she received further education in Paris, France, and Dresden, Germany. In 1877, she married the Marquis Manfridi Lanza di Mercato Bianco of Palermo, Sicily, with whom she had three sons. Career Clara Lanza Lanza's literary career began in 1884 with the publication of her first novel, Mr. Perkins' Daughter. She published half a dozen further novels as well as Tales of Eccentric Life, a collection of short stories (many with medical themes) coauthored with her father. Lanza's novels tended to focus on troubled relationships, especially marriages. Several were praised by critics for their realism and their originality. Of Basil Morton's Transgression (1890), one critic wrote that \\"no better piece of realism has been written for many a day.\\" Her 1909 novel of an unhappy marriage, The Dweller on the Borderland, was called \\"an exceptionally original book ‚Äî original in treatment, original in motif.\\" Some critics even found her work too harsh. Her 1891 novel A Modern Marriage, for example, was called \\"intellectual, analytical, purposeful, but ... unsympathetic in its tireless alertness and unslumbering observation.\\" An anomaly among her novels is Scarabaeus: The Story of an African Beetle (1892), coauthored with James Clarence Harvey. With such elements as a camera that can photograph the past and a plot centering on a talismanic gem and an ancient kingdom in Africa, it is closer to speculative fiction than to her usual realism. Lanza also wrote articles for periodicals like Cosmopolitan and Frank Leslie's Popular Monthly. An example of these is a tribute to her long friendship with the Irish novelist George Moore. Lanza found an American publisher for his book Mike Fletcher when his British publisher went suddenly out of business. Moore expressed interest in collaborating with her on dramatizing one of her novels that he had liked, but the project was abandoned after two acts had been completed. Among her articles are several about the lives of contemporary women, such as a chapter on the women clerks of New York for Lydia Hoyt Farmer's book What America Owes to Women, which was published as a souvenir of the 1893 Chicago World's Fair.

A win-win scenario. The double thank-you of capitalism is the observation that, when a merchant and a customer exchange money for goods, each thanks the other, showing that the transaction is not only voluntary, but mutually beneficial. This is in contrast to the impression of a \\"fixed slice pie\\" that occurs in many other situations, with one side taking and the other giving, a thank-you likely to pass only one way. The double thank-you is used in economic discourse to illustrate the primary benefit of a free market, that where all actions are voluntary, any transactions must benefit both sides, and this enriches the general community. Mutual benefit increases overall wealth This idea has been around for some time, at least as far back as Adam Smith and his book, The Wealth of Nations. Of this, Nobel laureate Milton Friedman said: In most other parts of life or society, one side tends to give and the other receive. There is a fixed slice pie, where the same amount of wealth exists, and is simply shuffled around. A poor person receiving aid from a social worker may feel grateful and say thanks, but the official giving the aid has no reason to say it back. A more extreme example is tax collecting, where neither side has any impulse to thank. The one that is receiving does so by threat of force, therefore feels empowered, not grateful. But a voluntary exchange is a win-win scenario, where each side feels they have more wealth after the trade than before. The shopkeeper needed money more than his product, but the buyer wanted the product more than the money he paid. Coining the \\"Double Thank-You\\" term, John Stossel described it thus: Stossel explains that this applies to not just local commerce, but even international trade. When a buyer in one country sends money to another country, he receives more than the local value of that money in goods, in return. Otherwise he would not have done it. But the seller, likewise, ended up with more money than the value of the goods he sent, as far as his own community is concerned. So a \\"trade deficit\\" is meaningless, all trade results in both sides being richer. Adam Smith said that nothing \\"can be more absurd than this whole doctrine of the balance of trade.\\" Jay Nordlinger applies this by saying that trade deals should work out for everyone, to turn out in all parties' best interest. Instead of one side winning and all others losing, everyone wins. Economist Steve Horwitz describes the \\"Double Thank You\\" as a \\"habit of cooperation\\", where people take for granted that if they act to benefit others, the behavior will be mutual, everyone winning out in the end. He contrasts an encounter with a helpful, even generous deli counter merchant with that of dealing with a TSA bureaucrat. When retrieving one's goods from the TSA inspector, the \\"habit of cooperation\\" of capitalism may give you the impulse to thank the agent for returning your own, rightful property. But you have no reason to say \\"thanks\\", because the agent has not given you a gift, not provided you with a service of any value, there was no voluntary exchange or contract. It is pointless \\"government monopoly security theater with no exit option and no value delivered.\\" Trade creates mutual wealth When Marco Polo or other traders traveled the Silk Road, they were bringing goods that were of relatively low value back home, and returning with goods that had been cheap where they went to trade.The way such voluntary transactions create wealth can be understood by imagining two islands. One is rocky and dry, growing mostly grasses that provide significant grazing for herd animals. Meat is plentiful and (therefore) cheap, but fresh vegetables are rare and expensive. On another island, though, the land is rich and soft, the weather rainy, conditions great for vegetables but bad for the hoofed animals commonly raised in the area. So vegetables are cheap, meat expensive and difficult to obtain. A merchant might buy a large amount of the cheap meat from the rocky island, then make the dangerous voyage to the rainy island with his cargo. He can sell for far more than he paid, while still charging less than any other meat in the area. He can then buy a cargo of very cheap vegetables, return to the rocky island, and sell it at a much higher price that nonetheless seems like a bargain to its populace. After his round trip, not only is he far richer than before, but so are the citizens of each island, having access to \\"expensive\\" food at what seems to them like a bargain price. This simple trade has increased wealth for each part of two different transactions, without actually producing more goods. This creation of wealth does not just involve geographic separation, but also information asymmetry. A trader with resources or knowledge of two different levels of demand for a good can buy in one place while selling in the other, creating wealth in both through what is known in finance and economics as arbitrage.

It began forming on August 10, 1941, as a standard Red Army rifle division at Omsk. It did not reach the front until March 1942, assigned to the 1st Shock Army in Northwestern Front. It served under these commands until September, then was pulled out of the line for rebuilding before being moved north to 8th Army of Volkhov Front. The division remained in Volkhov Front until the Front was disbanded in February 1944, fighting in Operation Iskra, which partly broke the siege of Leningrad, and then in the Leningrad-Novgorod Offensive, which completed the task, and won a battle honor. During the spring-summer 1944 it advanced through the Baltic States, being so worn down in the process that in September it was again moved to the reserves to be returned to a viable strength. In October it was reassigned to the 3rd Shock Army, and would advance with that Army through Poland and into Germany in 1945. The 364th ended the war in the Battle of Berlin with 1st Belorussian Front, and went on to serve postwar in the Group of Soviet Occupation Forces in Germany. It was converted into the 15th Mechanized Division in late 1945; the latter was disbanded in the Moscow Military District in early 1947.

This offensive began early on January 12, 1943, and by the morning of the 18th elements of the Volkhov and Leningrad Fronts had linked up, establishing a land corridor to the besieged city. 8th Army played strictly a supporting role in Iskra and the division saw little action.David M. Glantz, The Battle for Leningrad, 1941-1944, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2002, pp. 266, 274-75, 282 This victory prompted the newly-promoted Marshal Georgy Zhukov to begin planning a larger operation, dubbed \\"Pole Star\\", to cut off and defeat most of the German forces still in the Leningrad region.Glantz, Leningrad, p. 287 As part of the regrouping for this offensive the 364th was transferred to 2nd Shock Army in late January.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1943, p. 32 Volkhov Front's forces were ordered to attack on February 8 and capture Siniavino and the Gorodok No. 1 and No. 2 regions, directly south of the Iskra corridor. In the event the attack did not begin until the 12th. 2nd Shock's assault on Siniavino and its adjacent heights faltered immediately with heavy losses.Glantz, Leningrad, pp. 293, 296-97 In early March the division returned to 8th Army, where it would remain until January 1944. On March 12, General Solovyov became the deputy commanding officer of that Army, and he was replaced in command of the 364th by Col. Viktor Antonovich Vershbitsky. On the 19th, 8th Army launched a new offensive to liberate the town of Mga jointly with 55th Army attacking from the northwest; the division was in the Army's second echelon. Through three days of intense fighting the first-echelon divisions penetrated 3 to 4km on a 7km-wide front. A mobile group based on one regiment of the 64th Guards Rifle Division drove deep into the German positions but was soon barely contained. The fighting continued until April 3, when the spring thaw forced a halt.Glantz, Leningrad, pp. 300-02 A fifth attempt to liberate Siniavino began in July. 8th Army was to attack from a 13.6km sector in the Voronovo region, penetrate the enemy defenses and exploit to link up near Mga with the 55th and 67th Armies. The attacking forces were divided into two shock groups, with the 364th, reinforced with a tank regiment, in the first echelon of the southern group. This group faced the remnants of 5th Mountain Division and the left flank regiment of the 69th Infantry Division. The attack began at 0635 hours on July 22, but had been preceded by six days of artillery preparation attempting to destroy as much of the German fixed defenses as possible. The assault troops gained the first enemy trenches, but then encountered stiff resistance and heavy airstrikes; many of the tanks bogged down in the marshy terrain. In late July the second echelon divisions were committed to the battle, but made little difference. On August 9 units of the southern group found what they thought was a weak point in the positions held by 5th Mountain. The group was reinforced with two more rifle divisions and two tank regiments and attacked again on August 11. This effort was successful in taking the strongpoint at Poreche, but was again halted when the German 132nd Infantry Division arrived as reinforcements. The offensive collapsed in sheer exhaustion and ended on the 14th. The 364th was also involved in the sixth Siniavino offensive which finally seized the objective on September 15.Glantz, Leningrad, pp. 309, 311-13, 316-17 When the Leningrad-Novgorod Offensive began on January 14, 1944, the division was still in 8th Army. As Volkhov Front began its advance in the direction of Luga it began to encounter stiffer German resistance along the Rollbahn Line. As a result, on January 25 the 364th was assigned to the recently-formed 119th Rifle Corps, and that Corps was reassigned to the 54th Army.Glantz, Leningrad, pp. 360 On the following day the division distinguished itself in the liberation of the town of Tosno, and was given its name as an honorific:As of February 1 it was back to being a separate division in the reserves of Volkhov Front.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1944, p. 37 Baltic Campaign Volkhov Front was disbanded later in February, at which time the 364th was back in 54th Army, which was now in Leningrad Front. By the end of April it was in the 123rd Rifle Corps of 67th Army in the 3rd Baltic Front, and it continued to serve in that Front through the summer. On May 29, Colonel Vershbitskii was replaced in command by Col. Fyodor Aristarovich Makulkin, who was in turn replaced by Col. Ivan Andreevich Vorobev on July 9. Vorobev would continue in command for the duration of the war. By this time the division was down to 5,000 men; on July 24 it was reorganized with 4,202 total personnel, and just 60 men in each rifle company,Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 95 after fighting southeast of Ostrov since the end of March.

Millersville, MD, 2009, pp. 10, 22 However, its strength was minimal at this point. The 1212th Rifle Regiment had just 693 men in two small rifle battalions, and the 1216th Rifle Regiment had 718 men total, organized into five rifle companies and one reconnaissance platoon. In September the division was finally pulled back into the reserve of the 3rd Baltic Front. When that Front was disbanded in October, the division was reassigned to the 3rd Shock Army.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 95 Into Germany 3rd Shock was assigned to the 1st Belorussian Front on November 29, 1944, and the 364th was noted as being in that Army's 7th Rifle Corps at that time. It would remain under these commands for the duration of the war. During the Vistula-Oder Offensive the Army was mostly in the second echelon of the Front, operating with minimal forces in a mopping-up role.Soviet General Staff, Prelude to Berlin, ed. & trans. R.

As of April 15 it was deployed in the K√ºstrin bridgehead on an 11km front from Ortwig to Letschin. The main attack would be made on the left flank on a 6km front from Amt Keinitz to Letschin. The 364th at this time, like the rest of the Front's rifle divisions, had a strength of somewhere between 5,000 and 6,000 personnel. 7th Corps was in the second echelon, behind the 79th Rifle and 12th Guards Rifle Corps. The main offensive began on April 16, and during the next day the Corps crossed the Oder before concentrating north of Letschin.

A stepson of King Binnya U, the prince was an early supporter of his half-brother Binnya Nwe's successful rebellion against U in 1383‚Äì1384. However he was executed in 1388/89 by Nwe, now known as Razadarit, for suspicion of planning a rebellion. Early life Ma Nyi Kan-Kaung was the youngest of three children of Prince Min Linka of Pegu (Bago) and his wife Mwei Daw. He hailed from Martaban and Sukhothai royal lines, and was a half-nephew of then king Binnya U of Martaban.Pan Hla 2005: 47 The prince was born 1352,(Pan Hla 2005: 45‚Äì47): Kan-Kaung's parents were wedded in 1348/49; he had two elder sisters; and his father was executed early 1353. during his father's insurrection against the king. But the rebellion failed. In 1353, the entire family was brought to the capital Martaban (Mottama) where Binnya U had Linka executed, and raised Mwei Daw as his latest queen. The king did spare the three children due to the intervention of his chief queen Sanda Min Hla, who was also the children's maternal aunt.Pan Hla 2005: 57 Kan-Kaung grew up at the Martaban Palace until 1364. He found a reliable protector in Queen Sanda, who did not have any children and loved him like her own son. Then in early 1364, a palace coup drove the royal family to Donwun, a small town about north of Martaban where they stayed until 1369.Pan Hla 2005: 51‚Äì52, 57 He lost his protector Queen Sanda soon after their move to Donwun. According to the Razadarit Ayedawbon chronicle, her last request to Binnya U on her death bed was for U not to punish Kan-Kaung for his father's sins; she died after the king granted her wish. Governor of Dala=Appointment= U kept his promise. In 1370/71, about a year after he had moved his capital to Pegu, the king appointed his nephew and stepson governor of Dala (modern Dala Township and Twante Township in Yangon Region).Pan Hla 2005: 60 The appointment came after the previous governor Smin Zeik-Bye had died of natural causes. It was a key appointment to a strategically important region. Dala was about southwest of Pegu, and bordered the delta province where a serious rebellion by Gov. Laukpya of Myaungmya had been active since 1364. Indeed, when Kan-Kaung was appointed, Laukpya's forces were still raiding Dala and Syriam. But Kan-Kaung did not see much action as the king reached a truce with Laukpya, and Byattaba of Martaban 1371.Pan Hla 2005: 62‚Äì63 =Binnya Nwe's rebellion= Kan-Kaung ruled the district without incident until 1383. Then in May 1383, his 15-year-old maternal half-brother Prince Binnya Nwe came to Dagon (modern downtown Yangon) with a plan to raise a rebellion.Pan Hla 2005: 94 The young prince had been deeply dissatisfied with his ailing father, as well as with his adoptive mother Princess Maha Dewi, the de facto power. As Dala was across the river from Dagon, Kan-Kaung was the first governor Nwe tried to recruit. Kan-Kaung himself had been concerned about the princess's rumored plan to put her lover Smim Maru on the throne, and told Nwe's emissaries that he would support Nwe.Pan Hla 2005: 99‚Äì100 His support was crucial for the nascent rebellion. He initially provided over 300 troops and war elephantsPan Hla 2005: 130 before personally joining Nwe's camp at Dagon with additional men.Pan Hla 2005: 149‚Äì151 When Nwe marched to Pegu in December 1383, Kan-Kaung stayed behind at Dala to guard the rear.Pan Hla 2005: 155 =Final years= Kan-Kaung remained a steadfast supporter when Nwe became king on 4 January 1384 with the title of Razadarit. No other major vassal rulers‚Äîincluding viceroys Laukpya, Byattaba and Sam Lek‚Äîacknowledged the 16-year-old boy-king. Razadarit considered all of them in revolt although he could not yet take any action.Pan Hla 2005: 171 Kan-Kaung survived Razadarit's initial round of purges at Pegu that removed anyone with a claim to the throne. The new king promptly had his brother-in-law Maru executed,Pan Hla 2005: 160 and ordered his paternal half-brother Baw Ngan-Mohn imprisoned.Pan Hla 2005: 185 In contrast, Kan-Kaung was allowed to keep his post at Dala.Pan Hla 2005: 178 Chronicles are mum about Kan-Kaung's activities in the next four plus years. Although his name is not explicitly listed as a Hanthawaddy commander in the chronicles, he presumably led the defense of his district in 1385‚Äì1387 when the northern Ava forces invaded the southern country to oust Razadarit.Harvey 1925: 82‚Äì85 Dala was part of the defense line that stopped numerically superior Ava forces from advancing to Pegu.Yazawin Thit Vol. 1 2012: 199 Despite the success, the embattled king was suspicious about his half-brother's historical ties with Laukpya.Pan Hla 2005: 130, 178 The viceroy of Myaungmya was the one that invited Ava to oust Razadarit.Harvey 1925: 82Yazawin Thit Vol. 1 2012: 195‚Äì196 Then in 1388, after he had conquered the Martaban province (modern day Mon State and southern Kayin State), Razadarit received intelligence that Kan-Kaung had entered into a secret alliance with Laukpya.Pan Hla 2005: 178 The king sent a senior official named Smin Eindazeik to confirm the story. When the story was confirmed, Razadarit attacked Dala (probably in late 1388 or early 1389).The chronicle Razadarit Ayedawbon (Pan Hla 2005: 178) only says Dala was attacked in 750 ME (29 March 1388 to 28 March 1389) in preparation of an attack on Myaungmya. The attack was most probably in the dry season (November 1388 to May 1389), and since Dala was taken with at most minimal fight, Dala likely fell in the early dry season (November/December 1388). Kan-Kaung was arrested and executed and Razadarit appointed Kan-Kaung's son Baw Kyaw to succeed him as governor of Dala. Baw Kyaw was a loyal vassal to his uncle Razadarit; he also became a commander in the army and died in action in 1402.Yazawin Thit Vol. 1 2012: 220Pan Hla 2005: 228 Ancestry The prince was a grandson of King Saw Zein of Martaban, and a great grandson of King Loe Thai of Sukhothai.

The duchy of Lwowek was ruled by the Silesian Piast, Bernard the Lightsome, with its capital at Lwowek Slaski () in Lower Silesia, which gained town rights in 1217.  Geography  The original duchy was located in the south-western part of Lower Silesia on the current lands of Lwowek SlƒÖski County with the southern part of the duchy covering most of the modern Jelenia Gora County. Lwowek Slaski was the biggest town (around 11.000 inhabitants.) and also the capital of the duchy.

Some other important towns located within the lands of the duchy were: Wlen (), Gryfow SlƒÖski () and Jelenia Gora (). The main factor of the rapid development of the area was gold surrounding Lwowek Slaski and the trade road Via Regia. Some sources say that a few tons of gold were excavated in the Middle Ages from the mines around Lwowek. After the exhaustion of the gold mines the citizens started to earn from cloth producing, weaving, crafts, trade and sandstone processing.  History  Seal of Bernard the LightsomeBernard the Lightsome was the only ruler of the duchy of Lwowek. He was the youngest son of the Silesian prince Boleslaw II Rogatka and Hedwig, daughter of Henry I, Count of Anhalt. He became the ruler 3 years after his father died, in 1281 when Bernards' brother Bolko I the Strict partitioned the Duchy of Jawor and granted him western part of the duchy with its capital in Lwowek Slaski. The Duchy of Jawor and the duchy of Lwowek cooperated as brothers ruled in the two duchies. Bernard died unmarried and childless in 1286 and because of a lack of heirs the duchy of Lwowek was annexed and ruled by the Duchy of Jawor again by Bernard's brother Bolko I.  Castles  There were several castles guarding the lands of the duchy. The most important were those located in Wlen, Gryfow and Lwowek. = Lwowek Castle = Lwowek Castle ( ) was a medieval castle in Lwowek built to protect the inhabitants of the town. It was built at the beginning of the 13th century as a seat of Silesian princes. It was located in the southern part of the town, along the town walls. The founder of the castle was probably Henry I the Bearded. The castle was often visited by princes of Jawor and Swidnica-Jawor (for example Bolko I the Strict). The castle was partly destroyed during a fire in 1381 but the town council decided to rebuild the castle and in 1389 the renovation was complete. Since 1444 the castle was no longer a public property. The castle was destroyed again in 1475 after a huge fire and has never been rebuilt again. Now in the place of the castle stands the oldest brewery in Poland which started producing beer in 1209. The only remains of the castle are the sandstone foundations in the brewery's basement.

David Fear from Rolling Stone however gave the film two and a half stars out of five, stating: \\"In terms of both professional best-of moments and personal artifacts (home movies, old pics, those journals and cassette recordings), the filmmaker has a treasure trove at her fingertips; she just doesn't seem to know how to shape much of it, or how to mine it for more than checkpoints and pop-psychological carping about comedy and pain.\\" Matt Zoller Seitz writing for the website RogerEbert.com gave Love, Gilda three out of four stars and said: \\"Director Lisa D'Apolito's documentary is at its best detailing Radner's struggle to make her voice heard in a field that she adored, but that wasn't often hospitable to women, even when the individual men in it thought they were being gracious and inclusive.\\" Jason Zinoman from The New York Times called the film \\"a portrait of a brief and brilliant career\\" and completed: \\"Where the movie succeeds best is as an illumination of her charm and spirit. Ms. Radner played eccentric characters with raucous abandon and jangly big-kid physicality, but she also projected a vulnerability that made you care for them. The movie explores some of her insecurities, particularly with regard to her eating disorder, but its tone never strays too far from the light and breezy.\\" ReferencesExternal links Official Trailer on YouTube 2018 documentary films American documentary films American films Canadian documentary films Canadian films Saturday Night Live in the 1970s CNN Films films ","title":"Love, Gilda"},{"id":"58958132","text":"Arkansas v. Tennessee, 397 U.S. 88 (1970), was a case decided by the United States Supreme Court to settle a dispute between the states of Arkansas and Tennessee as to where a portion of the boundary line between the states should run. Facts Arkansas initiated the action on October 13, 1967, with respect to an area extending six miles laterally along the west (Arkansas side) bank of the Mississippi River, encompassing approximately five thousand acres. The area, known as Cow Island Bend in the Mississippi River, was located between Crittenden County, Arkansas, and Shelby County, Tennessee. The case was brought under the court's original jurisdiction under Art. III, ¬ß 2, of the Constitution of the United States. Procedure On January 15, 1968, the court appointed Gunnar Nordbye, a Senior United States Judge of the District of Minnesota, as Special Master to determine the state line in the disputed area.. Nordbye conducted an evidentiary hearing and viewed the area. He then filed his report with the Supreme Court recommending that all of the disputed area be declared part of the State of Tennessee. Result The parties had agreed that the state line was the thalweg, or steamboat channel, of the Mississippi River as it flows west and southward between the states. Nordbye heard evidence and was presented exhibits and maps which showed that the migration of the Mississippi River northward and west continued until about 1912. At that time, an avulsion occurred leaving Tennessee lands on the west or Arkansas side of the new or avulsive river channel. Nordbye found that, thereafter, because of the avulsion, the water in the thalweg became stagnant, and erosion and accretion no longer occurred. At this time, the boundary between Arkansas and Tennessee became fixed in the middle of the old abandoned channel. The Supreme Court affirmed this finding, quoting from its opinion in an earlier dispute between the same states where it had held: Nordbye was then further authorized to engage surveyors to determine the exact line of the boundary, with the states to split the cost. A decree establishing the surveyed boundary line was entered on June 23, 1970.

Facts The City of Phoenix held an election in June 1969, in which the issuance of general obligation bonds to finance various municipal improvements was approved. Under Arizona law, only real property taxpayers were permitted to vote. Six days after the election, the U.S. Supreme Court held, in Cipriano v. City of Houma,. that restricting the franchise to property taxpayers in elections on revenue bonds violated the Equal Protection Clause. In August 1969, Emily Kolodziejski, who owned no realty, challenged the franchise restriction and attacked the validity of the June election. The District Court, finding no significant difference between revenue bonds and general obligation bonds, held the nonproperty owner exclusion unconstitutional. It declared the June bond election invalid, since the authorization for the issuance of the bonds was not final on the date of the Cipriano decision. Result The Supreme Court unanimously affirmed, holding that the Equal Protection Clause prohibits states from restricting the franchise to real property taxpayers in elections to approve the issuance of general obligation bonds, as the differences between the interests of property owners and nonproperty owners are not sufficiently substantial to justify excluding the latter from voting.. The decision was held to apply only to authorizations for general obligation bonds that are not final as of the date of the decision.Phoenix, 399 U.S. at 213-215.

The Esp√≠ritu Santo contains some notable paintings including a seated, post-crucifixion Christ on the right wall, and catacombs. It is considered one of the oldest temples in Havana and it is said that its main interest lies essentially in the simplicity or simplicity of the beautiful stone construction. History Iglesia del Esp√≠ritu Santo, Havana_master sepulchre The church was rebuilt and expanded in 1648 and given the rank of a parish. During the colonial era it had exceptional importance, since by a Papal Bull of 1772 and a Royal Certificate of 1773, of Charles III of Spain, it was declared \\"√önica Iglesia inmune en esta ciudad, construida en 1855.\\" (‚Äùthe only immune church in this city, built-in 1855.\\"), which meant that any persecuted individual could find Amparo (sanctuary) in it against the action of the authorities or of justice. A metal plaque at the foot of the bell tower attests to this fact. Many illustrious people of Havana were baptized in this church, among them the educator Jos√© de la Luz y Caballero. Bishop Ger√≥nimo Vald√©s, a founder of La Casa de Beneficencia y Maternidad de La Habana, was buried in the Church; the master sepulcher of Bishop Vald√©s was found in 1936. Paintings There are original paintings by the Cuban painter Jos√© Nicol√°s de la Escalera (\\"Cuba's first painter\\") and Aristides Fernandez (20th Century), among them the large oil painting titled The Burial of Christ. Architecture Plan of Iglesia del Esp√≠ritu Santo, Havana, Cuba Iglesia del Esp√≠ritu Santo_roof construction looking towards the front. The Iglesia del Esp√≠ritu Santo's greatest interest from an architectural point of view lies in the simplicity of the coral stone construction and the lack of lavish decoration. Other elements of great importance are the funerary crypts that were discovered in 1953. The crypt is from times before the Colon Cemetery (1876) in El Vedado was built. The crypt is entered from the left of the altar and contains several catacombs. =Cuban uni-nave= The building was built in the \\"uni-nave\\" style, as pointed out by Joaqu√≠n Weiss, a Cuban architect, and historian and one of the most authoritative authorities on the subject. Uni- nave was the style of Cuban religious constructions in the seventeenth century and meant that it originally had only one central nave. An additional side nave In the first years of the XVIII century, the bell tower was built and around 1720 the vault of the presbytery was built. In 1760, Bishop D. Pedro Morell of Santa Cruz ordered the construction of a nave (8x29m) lateral to the main temple nave. The church sits on a plinth of about 18 cm that may be seen along Calles Cuba and Acosta. The building is 60m long as measured on the exterior, East-West along Calle Acosta, although from the interior it appears that the last 10m was a later addition as the walls of this ten-meter square room are thinner (along Calle Acosta) and the roof structure does not span the ten-meter dimension. There is a column in the middle of the room to distribute the weight of the roof. =Bays= There are seven bays of approximately fifty-seven centimeters in length along the main nave. The first bay at the entrance is the shortest of about five meters in length and contains a balcony above which is reached by the stairs of the belfry. The elliptical arch supported by matching pilasters at opposite walls date from 1808 which is the year of the construction of the bell tower. In the middle of the XIX century, the entire wall that faces Acosta Street was rebuilt and the main fa√ßade was remodeled. The three-story bell-tower was built in the year 1808 and it is located immediately to the left of the church upon entering, it is one of the tallest structures in Old Havana. The tower was built by the master Pedro Hern√°ndez de Santiago. There are five windows along the Calle Acosta wall and, except for the window in the presbytery which aligns with the center of the room, do not align with the grid of the columns. Thus the windows appear to be haphazardly placed without regard for the geometry of the nave or the rhythm of the structure. =Ceiling= The roof of the church terminates on the interior in a wooden ceiling of paired cross-tie braces and hidden tie backs springing from every column and supported on wooden corbels. The wood cross- tie brace ceiling is a common construction in Havana and may be seen in the wooden ceiling of the Church of Santo Cristo del Buen Viaje at Amargura and Cristo Streets in Havana Vieja and Iglesia de Santa Clara de Asis  Notes ReferencesExternal links :Entierro de Cristo, Ar√≠stides Fern√°ndez :Uni-nave church Mar√≠a Auxiliadora - Habana Vieja Religious buildings and structures in Havana Buildings and structures in Havana Churches in Havana Roman Catholic churches in Havana 18th-century Roman Catholic church buildings Tourist attractions in Havana Neoclassical architecture in Cuba History of Havana ","title":"Iglesia del Esp√≠ritu Santo, Havana"},{"id":"58958198","text":"Ferahn√ºma was an Ottoman corvette launched in 1792.

It was designed by Walter Liberty Vernon and built in 1912. The property is owned by Property NSW, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002.  History  The Brooklyn Hotel site was once part of the original Parade Ground of the Colony. The land was claimed by Robert Howe on the basis of a land grant promised to his father George Howe by Governor Macquarie. George Howe was a convict who arrived in Sydney in 1800 and became government printer. In 1802 printed the first book in Australia, \\"New South Wales General Standing Orders, comprising Government and General Orders issued between 1791 and 1802\\". In 1803 he began the publication of the first newspaper, the Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser on the site. In 1845, the \\"Printing Office\\" was owned by Flowers, Alding & Co. and the tenant was Stratham & Foster. By 1848 the original grant fronting George Street comprised 'Mr. Dawson's House', a passage and the first of a series of terraced shops and houses. The subdivision and the houses built upon it remained essentially unchanged until 1884. The passage and the house and shop to the north represent, approximately, the site of the present hotel. In the period 1882-84 these terraces were demolished and a new four storey Italianate building was erected. The first bay of this new building was a hotel, named sequentially: 1884-1888 - The Sydney and Melbourne Hotel; 1889-1897 - The Sydney Palace Hotel; 1898-1982 - The Brooklyn Hotel). In 1911 an application was lodged by T. Bennett with the City Council to demolish the Brooklyn Hotel, and in 1912 the current Brooklyn Hotel was erected at the same time as the Johnson's Building.SCRA, 1982: 7-8 It was designed by Walter Liberty Vernon, who had retired as New South Wales Government Architect. From 1980 negotiations proceeded with the private sector on proposals for mixed development and recycling on the land bounded by George, Grosvenor, Harrington and Essex Streets, known as Sites D5, D6 and D11. The agreement for the Grosvenor Place project was signed in June, 1983 involving the renovation of Royal Naval House and four adjacent buildings, including the Brooklyn Hotel. Work on Grosvenor Place commenced in 1984 and was completed in 1988. In 1987, work commenced on the$12.5m reconstruction and renovation of Royal Naval House and Federation Hall in Grosvenor Street to enable the buildings to house the Sydney Futures Exchange. The reconstruction and renovation of the three remaining historic buildings on the site, including the Brooklyn Hotel, was carried out in 1989 for use as bars and a restaurant.SCRA, Annual Reports, 1980-1989 It operated as the Brooklyn Hotel for many years following the redevelopment, but closed in its hotel form following St George's Bank's foreclosure on owner and Woollahra publican John Chaina's hotels in November 2010. It reopened as a bar and restaurant, the \\"Morrison Bar and Oyster Room\\", in 2012.  Description  This Edwardian building in Federation Free Style has a four-storey brick and sandstone facade featuring a central sandstone projecting bay on the first and second floors, with an open balcony above with small ionic columns. There are narrow multi-pane windows on each side of the bay and small pediments above those on the second floor. At the top there is a large simple brick pediment and dentilated eaves. The awning, part of the original design, is claimed to be one of the first of its type in Australia, being suspended over the footpath on iron rods. Due to the extensive reconstruction of the building in 1989, only the fa√ßade remains of the original fabric.

PMA clients included investment banks, pension funds, and commercial developers and it became a successful international operation.https://www.pma.co.uk/home/eng/services.htm It still conducts bespoke studies to assess commercial prospects for retail, office and industrial investments. Cadman and Barras set up a PMA subscription service, PROMIS, that still provides regularly updated information on most UK and some global urban markets, currently on 300 towns and cities. Cadman stepped away in the 2000s to other consultancy work and to writing and reflection on questions of spirituality and sustainability. =Spirituality= Cadman became more interested in sustainable urban development and particularly the \\"place of love\\" from which Quaker testimonies spring, and how to enact these in everyday life. He has edited several volumes on this theme, particularly since retiring from the property sector. He has worked with the Temenos Academy, an educational charity offering education in philosophy and the arts spanning the sacred traditions of East and West. Temenos was initially accommodated in London by Charles, Prince of Wales and Cadman has also edited volumes of the Prince's speeches (2014 and 2019) and had work published by the Prince's Trust. He was chairman of what is now known as The Prince‚Äôs Foundation for Building Community and was a Trustee of The Prince‚Äôs School of Traditional Arts.https://www.psta.org.uk/ Among several board positions on sustainability, peace and harmony, Cadman was involvedhttps://www.sohforum.org/portfolio- items/david-cadman/ in establishing the inter-faith Spirit of Humanity Forum in 2010, which held its first meeting in Rekyavik in 2012 (as a counter to the World Economic Forum in Davos) and now meets every two years. Its goals are to \\"bring together leaders and practitioners who hold the view that the positive energy of love is the deepest, most enduring and most valuable characteristic of human nature. The aim of the Forum is to identify and share ways of improving access to this inner strength of being. It showcases practical examples of how love, compassion and a care for others can transform and truly re-humanise an organisation.\\"https://www.sohforum.org/background/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s3HqTYUcD4 A 2017 novel, and sequels, written under a pseudonym, The House by the Marsh and Abraham Soar, mirrors some aspects of his own life, addressing ageing and loss.

As a scholar, Stevenson published books and articles on Egyptology and the material culture of the ancient Near East, as well as a memoir about the reign of Maximilian I of Mexico. She was the first curator of the Egyptian Collection at the Penn Museum and played an important role in acquiring much of the collection itself. As a women's rights activist, she served as the first president of the Equal Franchise Society and the Civic Club of Philadelphia. She was the first woman to receive an honorary degree from the University of Pennsylvania, the first woman to lecture at the Peabody Museum at Harvard University, and the first female member of the Jury of Awards for Ethnology at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago.  Personal life = Childhood & early life = Sara Yorke Stevenson's parents were Edward Yorke (December 20, 1798 ‚Äì 1868) and Sarah Hanna Yorke, who married in New Orleans, Louisiana in 1834 and who moved to Paris during the 1840s. They both came from established families: her mother's family owned a large cotton plantation and her father was a cotton broker. Edward Yorke was born in Philadelphia and moved to New Orleans to represent the Yorke & Macalister law firm. In Louisiana he was involved in the establishment of the public school system in New Orleans. He became interested in business ventures, including the introduction of gas to Paris, and a trans-isthmian railway in Tehuantepec. He died of paralysis in Vermont in 1868. Sarah Hanna was born in Alabama and moved with her family to New Orleans. In addition to Sara, their youngest child, Edward and Sarah Hanna Yorke had four other children: * Edward Yorke: born in New Orleans; educated in engineering at the √âcole Centrale in Paris; married Jane Heard; died by drowning in 1884. * Ellen Yorke: born in New Orleans, married Captain Charles Blanchot in 1865. * Ogden Yorke: born in New Orleans; educated in engineering at the √âcole Centrale in Paris; killed by brigands while working on the Isthmian Railway in 1862. * Mary Yorke: born in Paris, France; married Maurice Kingsley.  France  Sara Letitia Yorke was born in the Rue de Courcelles in Paris on February 19, 1847. Sara's parents moved back to the States when she was only ten, leaving their daughters to attend boarding school in France. She lived in Paris from 1858 through 1862 under the guardianship of M. Achille Jubinal, who inspired Stevenson's early interest in archaeology and Egyptology. During this time she met the Duke of Morny, half-brother of Napoleon and prominent figure in the French Intervention in Mexico, a conflict with which she would soon become profoundly familiar. In 1862, Sara departed France for Mexico by sea, about which she wrote: There were only forty passengers on board, and, comparatively speaking, little of the animation that usually precedes the outgoing of an ocean steamer. I found without difficulty the French banker and his Mexican wife who had kindly consented to chaperon me during my lonely journey; and I soon discovered that she and I were the only women passengers on board.  Mexico  In 1862 the Yorke family moved to Tacubaya, a suburb of Mexico City, following the murder of Sara's brother Ogden. In Mexico she attended many social gatherings of the newly appointed Empress of Mexico Charlotte of Belgium and her husband Maximilian. Stevenson's first-hand account of the Second Mexican Empire, Maximilian in Mexico: A Woman's Reminiscences of the French Intervention 1862-1867 (New York, 1899), gave great insight into the inner workings of court life during that time. C.M. Mayo commented on this book was the \\"most lucid, informed, and balanced...of all the English language memoirs of the Second Empire/French Intervention. Sara Yorke Stevenson and her mother, Sarah Hanna Yorke, appear in Mayo's novel The Last Prince of the American Empire.  United States  In 1867, the Yorke family relocated to Vermont. Sara's father died only a year later, in 1868, and soon afterwards, at the age of twenty-one, Sara Yorke moved to Philadelphia to live with two of her uncles and an aunt on the Yorke side of her family. = Marriage & family = Sara Yorke married Cornelius Stevenson, a Philadelphia lawyer, on June 30, 1870. Cornelius Stevenson was born in Philadelphia on January 14, 1842, the only son of Adam May and Anna Smith (Philips) Stevenson. He served as a private in the First Troop, Philadelphia City Cavalry during the Civil War. Sara Yorke Stevenson and Cornelius Stevenson had one child, William Yorke Stevenson (1878-1922) who married Christine Wetherill Rice. = Death = Sara Yorke Stevenson Tribute Plate Sara Yorke Stevenson died on November 14, 1921. In February 1922, a tribute to Stevenson was included in the Pennsylvania Museum Bulletin that described her as follows: > To us there will always rise, at the mention of Mrs. Stevenson's name, the > dignified little figure with the black bag out of which she brought, like > the unexpected mother in the Swiss Family Robinson, precisely the thing > needed at the moment. For wise counsel, for tolerance, for understanding > sympathy, we all of us came to her and never were refused. Her counsel was > based on an experience of the world which included half a century of real > intimacy with brilliant and wise people who sought her as a companion; it > was poignant with interludes of the Mexican capital, Parisian days and > Egyptian excavations. It was invariably moral and direct, but tempered with > a worldliness that was never the counsel of the fear of consequences. Her > tolerance, while it seemed almost universal, balked at glossing over a sham > or condoning insincerity. If she did not always suffer fools gladly she was > generally able to contrive some amusement from them to shorten their > discourse by a quick turn of wit. The Sara Yorke Stevenson papers were removed from the home of Frances Anne Wister and donated to LaSalle University's Connelly Library as a part of the Owen Wister Collection by the David Prince Estate. She is buried at the Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia.  Professional and civic life = Civic societies = Stevenson played a leading role in several local civic societies (aka civil societies, or groups of community of citizens often linked by collective interests and activities) including serving as the founder and first president of the Equal Franchise Society of Philadelphia, co-founder and two-term president of the Civic Club of Philadelphia (a group of women who advocated for civic reform and improvement), the president of the Acorn Club for 25 years, president of the Contemporary Club, and chair of the French War Relief Committee of the Emergency Aid of Pennsylvania. She also served on the Women's Centennial Committee of the Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition of 1876, which created an exhibition known as the \\"Women's Building\\" that showcased \\"for the first time, at an international exposition, the intimate bonds, shared values, and material achievements of women\\" and was hailed as a milestone in the women's movement of the 19th century.  The Furness- Mitchell Coterie  Early Portrait of Sara Yorke Stevenson Stevenson was part of a group of internationally known Philadelphia elite scholars, known as the Furness-Mitchell Coterie, who were a driving force in many areas, especially anthropology, during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The group included musicians, physicians, writers, scholars, anthropologists, and educators and was \\"unusual in its acceptance of accomplished women as intellectual equals\\". Because of her involvement in the coterie, Stevenson was able to form close relationships and work collaboratively with other members of the group, including Horace Howard Furness, Owen Wister, S. Weir Mitchell, Talcott Williams, and Agnes Irwin.  The Equal Franchise Society of Philadelphia  Stevenson established the Equal Franchise Society of Pennsylvania, in recognition of the difficulties women faced in obtaining the right to vote. She served as president until 1910 and first vice president until the Federal Suffrage Amendment passed in 1920. In 1910, the Equal Franchise Society of Philadelphia republished the speech entitled \\"Shall Women Have the Right to Vote?\\", originally delivered by Wendell Philipps in Worcester, MA in 1851. In the forward of the publication, Stevenson (signed only as 'S.Y.S.'), reflected on the ongoing struggle for women's suffrage, writing: > A Chinese philosopher, a disciple of Laotse, once said: ‚ÄúMan is like a child > born at midnight who when he sees the sunrise, thinks there was no > yesterday.‚Äù There are many persons in the community even today, who regard > the present movement in favor of equal suffrage as a transitory, hysterical > agitation of a demagogic nature, of which the impulse has been received in > the United States from the outbreaks of militant partisans in England. In > the minds of these persons, the movement in the past is vaguely associated > with eccentric clothing and more or less ridicule; in the present, with the > restlessness of what is regarded as an unwomanly demonstration. While > believers in equal suffrage in this country have taken advantage of the > interest aroused in every part of the world by the news from the militant > suffragists of England, the movement can claim a respectable history and a > fairly long pedigree. If in the last century the pioneers in the demand for > ‚ÄúWomen's Rights‚Äù in England found strength in the support of such men as > John Stuart Mill, their American sisters found among others an outspoken > champion in another clear thinker‚Äî Wendell Phillips. The principle of > equality is generally admitted‚Äîthe question of expediency still faces us. In > reprinting Wendell Phillips‚Äô admirable address, the intention therefore, is > to make clear the relation of the present movement to its historical > background. While listening to the words of a strong man who, in 1851, had > the courage to support an unpopular cause in the interest of justice and > fair play, it is hoped that encouragement will be given to those who today > are fighting in the ranks. - S. Y. S With regard to her active role in the women's rights movement, Stevenson said the following: \\"The days of useless martyrdom are over, also those of heroic sacrifice where it is not needed. What we need to do today is not to slaughter men and parties who do not happen to think as we do ‚Ä¶ but to educate them, teach them to see, to know, to love, to feel, to grow.\\" Career= Anthropology and egyptology = Sara Yorke Stevenson Working In the 1880s anthropology was still emerging as an established academic discipline, and universities were beginning to develop and formalize their anthropology departments. Stevenson became involved in Egyptological pursuits through her membership in the American branch of the Egypt Exploration Fund, which was founded in 1882 by Amelia Edwards. Throughout her career, Stevenson made several trips overseas, although she never carried out her own archaeological fieldwork. She contributed to the collections of what is now the University of Pennsylvania' Museum of Anthropology and Archaeology as the first curator of the Egyptian and Mediterranean section, a position to which she was appointed in 1890. \\"Anthropological Work in America\\", an article in the July 1892 issue of Popular Science Monthly, declared that Stevenson \\"is perhaps [America's] only lady Egyptologist. Her lectures in Egyptian subjects have made a sensation.\\" She mentored with Frederick Ward Putnam, who had just established Harvard's anthropology department, along with Franz Boas, Zelia Nuttall, and Alice Fletcher. Stevenson's interests were very wide and ranged from cultural diffusion to cultural evolution. In 1892 Putnam supported Stevenson's appointment to the Jury of Awards for Ethnology during the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. A special act had to be passed to allow a woman to serve this position; Stevenson was elected vice president of the jury. In 1894 Stevenson was the first woman to speak at the Peabody Museum on \\"Egypt at the Dawn of History\\". She was president of the Oriental Club of Philadelphia, the Contemporary Club, president and secretary Pennsylvania Chapter of the Archaeological Institute of America, and was founder and officer of the University Archaeological Association, the American Folk-Lore Society, and the American Exploration Society. She was also a member of the Numismatic and Antiquarian Society of Philadelphia and in 1895 was one of the first two women admitted to the American Philosophical Society. Stevenson also joined the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1884 and was nominated a Fellow in 1895. In 1894, Stevenson was the first woman to receive an honorary doctorate degree from the University of Pennsylvania. She also received an honorary degree from Temple University, and medals from the National Institute of Social Sciences Association. Of Stevenson's role, Langdon Warner stated: \\"‚ÄúIf women today find no difficulty in being recognized as scholars, and if their counsel is demanded in Museums, it is due to Mrs. Stevenson in a far greater measure than our casual generation will ever know.\\"  University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology  Stevenson played a pivotal role in the establishment of the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology (Penn Museum). In 1891, Stevenson, William Pepper, Talcott Williams, and Joseph Coates were appointed by the University Archaeological Association to create the Department of Archaeology and Paleontology. Stevenson then served on the governing board from its start (1892) until 1905 (secretary 1894-1904; president 1904-05). During her tenure, she contributed to the building of the \\"Free Museum of Science and Art\\", which was first dedicated in 1899 and which eventually became the Penn Museum. She served as the curator of the Egyptian and Mediterranean section of the museum from 1890 to 1905. In her position as curator, Stevenson was concerned with collections acquisitions and in 1898 she travelled to Egypt and purchased 42 cases of artifacts for the American Exploration Society, mostly from the ancient site of Dendereh, including the Penn Museum's first papyrus. Stevenson in her office at the Penn Museum In 1905, Stevenson, along with more than 125 supporters, resigned from her position at the museum following controversy surrounding Herman Hilprecht's personal appropriations and fraudulent publication of antiquities. Hilprecht was cleared of charges but Stevenson never returned to her position at the museum. As noted in her Penn Museum biography: \\"As one of the principal founders of the University Museum, one whose contributions to the building program of the Museum was essential to its success, Stevenson set a powerful example for generations of women to follow.\\" = Journalism = Stevenson wrote as a columnist for the Philadelphia Public Ledger under the pen names Peggy Shippen (\\"Peggy Shippen's Diary\\") and Sally Wistar (\\"Sally Wistar Says\\") until 1920. As Peggy Shippen, Stevenson wrote a society column for Philadelphia's elite, and her pseudonym paid homage to Peggy Shippen, a Philadelphian and a prominent figure during the Revolutionary War who was married to Benedict Arnold. = Education and museum studies = Following her departure from the Penn Museum in 1905, Stevenson developed one of the first college-level courses in training museum professionals in the United States, which she taught at the Pennsylvania Museum and School of Industrial Art, now known as The University of the Arts (Philadelphia). Her lectures covered topics ranging from \\"The Modern Museum and its Functions\\" to \\"The Diseases of Objects and Remedies.\\" She also became a curator in the museum now known as the Philadelphia Museum of Art.

The pair's debut mini-album was released in 2015. The record's lead single \\"Sweet Heart\\" did not see success until two years after its release, when a broadcast jockey sang the song in midst of live streaming and became a viral video. It led the song to peak at number 13 on the national Gaon Digital Chart, where it sold nearly 1.3 million downloads by the end of 2017. History Originally majoring in fashion design, Shin Hyun-hee learned to play acoustic guitar after watching tutorials on the online video website YouTube. She posted videos on the platform, which led her to perform in Daegu where she met Kim Root. A jazz major, Kim wanted to form a jazz ensemble at the time. He felt that Shin's voice was \\"incredibly good\\", and decided to form a band with her. Seenroot at the 2015 Bluespring Festival Seenroot's first release \\"Comfortable Song\\" was included on the compilation album Between the Cafes Vol.2 (2013), which featured songs from new acoustic indie music acts. The duo released its debut single \\"Cap Song\\" on April 4, 2014. The pair participated in over 200 performances and festivals for the following ten months. Seenroot released its debut self-titled mini-album on February 26, 2015. Writing for newspaper No Cut News, Kim Hyeon-shik described the lead single \\"Sweet Heart\\" as \\"cheerful and fresh\\", noting its \\"peculiar attraction\\". The band released its first studio album Seenroot's Wonderland on June 15, 2016. In January 2017, AfreecaTV broadcast jockey Kkotnim sang \\"Sweet Heart\\" while live streaming. The clip was shared across social media and became a viral video, which fueled the track to climb South Korean online music stores two years after its initial release. The song entered the country's national singles chart at number 34 and peaked at number 13. The duo's mini-album The Color of Seenroot was released on July 11, 2018.
