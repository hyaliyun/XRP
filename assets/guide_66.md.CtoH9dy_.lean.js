It was founded in 1954 by leaders of the North Georgia Conference of the Methodist Church and Emory University to provide care for seniors unable to care for themselves. The Center began its affiliation with Emory's Robert W. Woodruff Health Sciences Center in the 1980s formalizing its tie with the University. In the late 1990s, that affiliation grew stronger and led to an agreement under which nearby Wesley Woods Center came under Emory's umbrella. Out of this grew the Wesley Woods Center of Emory University, with interdisciplinary training, research and treatment programs for geriatric care. In 2015 it was renamed Emory Wesley Woods Center. Located a mile and a half from Emory University Hospital on a wooded campus in Atlanta's Druid Hills neighborhood, Emory Wesley Woods Center comprises Wesley Woods Geriatric Hospital, Wesley Woods Long Term Hospital, Wesley Woods Outpatient Clinic, Budd Terrace nursing care facility, Wesley Woods Towers and the Wesley Woods Health Center. One of only a handful of geriatric centers in the United States Emory Wesley Woods Center and the dedicated staff provide care to older adults throughout Georgia and the Southeast. Emory Wesley Woods Center provides care and research and has a hand in developing how senior care will be provided in the future not just in Georgia, but throughout the country.Bassett, B.(2001). Three Score & More Aging with Grace through Wesley Woods. Campus Wesley Woods Towers The first building to open was Wesley Woods Towers in 1965. One of only a few retirement living options in the area at the time, the Towers were the first round buildings constructed in Atlanta. The round shape of each building allows the 201 apartments to be organized into \\"neighborhoods,\\" providing the residents a sense of community. Wesley Woods Senior Living, Inc. As the retirement housing division of Wesley Woods, Wesley Woods Senior Living, Inc. and affiliates owns and manages the sister communities of Wesley Woods providing affordable, independent apartment and cottage living, assisted living, nursing care and Alzheimer's care at eight locations throughout North Georgia. It is affiliated with both the North Georgia Conference of the United Methodist Church and Emory Wesley Woods Center. A non-profit organization, Wesley Woods Senior Living communities provide comprehensive, regionally oriented programs and serve as training and research facilities to address important health issues associated with aging. Wesley Woods Health Center As time passed, Wesley Woods' leadership recognized that skilled nursing care would be a pressing need for its residents living in the Towers as well as in the surrounding community. Out of that need grew the Wesley Woods Health Center, which was completed in 1967. The Health Center provided skilled nursing care and treatment to restore patients to their former living arrangements, as well as long-term care for patients unable to return home. The Health Center was home to a number of prominent Atlantans, including Lena Fox whose life served as a basis for a play and subsequently, the movie \\"Driving Miss Daisy.\\" The building is now home to the Emory Center for Health in Aging, an interdisciplinary training and research center used by the Emory Schools of Medicine, Nursing and Public Health. Through the Emory Center for Health in Aging, Wesley Woods Center and Emory University are working together along with 19 other academic medical facilities throughout the United States to develop teaching methods for future geriatricians. The Health Center is also home to Emory researchers focusing on movement disorders, Alzheimer's disease and neurology. In 2007, a research neuro-imaging center was constructed on the second floor of the building to assist Emory scientists in these areas of research. Other clinics in the building include the Fuqua Center for Late-Life Depression, the Emory Sleep Center, an outpatient geriatric psychiatry practice and a geriatric dentist. At any one time, there are more than 150 physicians, researchers and/or nurses working together to discover new treatments, provide care and develop new medical techniques for seniors. Budd Terrace Nursing Care Facility As the campus continued to develop, leadership decided an intermediate-care facility was needed. Budd Terrace, named in honor of Dr. Candler Budd, one of those responsible for bringing to fruition a ministry to older adults in the North Georgia Conference, was opened as an assisted living facility in 1972. Built to accommodate 200 people, it became one of the first free standing, intermediate-care units in the Southeast. Budd Terrace provides long-term care and sub-acute care to Atlanta seniors. The facility has been undergoing renovations over the past few years. In 2006, inpatient hospice services were added to the list of services offered at Budd Terrace. Geriatric Hospital In September 1985, ground was broken for the $20 million, 100-bed Geriatric Teaching and Research Hospital. This was the first free-standing geriatric hospital in the nation. The stated goals of the hospital are to diagnose and treat medical and psychiatric disorders affecting older adults, to develop models for geriatric services and educational resources and to broaden Wesley Woods' commitment to charitable care. The prize-winning architectural design for the geriatric hospital creates a non-institutional feel, with low exterior lines topped with gabled roofs and each patient room opening onto a living-room-like space. The two-story hospital features an outpatient clinic, in-patient and out-patient rehabilitation services, long term acute care, a medical unit and two secure inpatient psychiatric units. =The Foundation= Each year, Wesley Woods provides millions of dollars worth of unreimbursed care with support from donors and foundations. The Foundation of Wesley Woods was created to help ensure that health care services remain available to seniors in Georgia. The foundation works to make possible health, comfort and dignity in the lives of older, poorer adults, and for those whose health problems have left them physically and financially depleted, and for those who are alone. The funds raised for charitable care have replaced reimbursement shortfalls and allowed older adults who are unable to pay for treatment to continue to receive care. The Foundation has provided funds for the upkeep and renovation of the retirement communities. They also enable the Foundation to provide special care for patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and age-related depression.

SNCP is a dedicated (1+1) protection mechanism for SDH network spans which may be deployed in ring, point to point or mesh topologies. Relation to other mechanisms It is complementary to Multiplex Section Protection (MSP), applied to physical handover interfaces; which offers 1+1 protection of the handover. An alternative to SNCP is Multiplex Section Shared Protection Rings or MS-SPRings, which offers a shared protection mode. SNCP's functional equivalent in SONET is called UPSR Specifications SubNetwork Connection Protection is a per path protection. It follows the principle of Congruent Sending Selective Receive, i.e., Signal is sent on both paths but received only where the Signal Strength is best. When the working path for Signal receiving is cut, the receiver detects SD (Signal Degradation) and the receiver of the other path becomes active. SNCP is a network protection mechanism for SDH networks providing path protection (end-to-end protection). The data signal is transmitted in a ring structure via two different paths and can be implemented in line or ring structures. The changeover criteria are specified individually when configuring a network element. A protection protocol is not required. The switchover to protection path occurs in the non-revertive mode, i.e. if traffic was switched to the protection path due to a transmission fault, there is no automatic switch-back to the original path once the fault is rectified, but only if there is a fault on the new path (the one labeled as \\"protecting\\" and currently services traffic). Functionality of mechanism SNCP is a 1+1 protection scheme (one working and one protection transport entity). Input traffic is broadcast in two routes (one being the normal working route and the second one being the protection route). Assume a failure free state for a path from a node B to a node A. Node B bridges the signal destined to A from other nodes on the ring, both on working and protecting routes. At node A, signals from these two routes are continuously monitored for path layer defects and the better quality signal is selected. Now consider a failure state where fiber between node A and node B is cut. The selector switches traffic on the standby route when the active route between node A and node B is failed. In order to prevent any unnecessary or spurious protection switching in the presence of bit errors on both paths, a switch will typically occur when the quality of the alternate path exceeds that of the current working path by some threshold (e.g., an order of magnitude better BER). Consecutively, any case of failure drops in SNCP's decision mechanism.

He was mostly active in 1990s. Fearing backlash from the Mumbai police, Budesh fled to Bahrain in the late eighties, where he opened up his new base of operations in the capital city of Manama. Biography Early life Most of the details of Budesh's early life and background are unclear. Born to an Indian mother and Arab father, he made his entrance into the Mumbai underworld as a petty pickpocket and a street ruffian. The police in Vikhroli, a north-eastern suburb of the city, had registered a case of assault against him.New ganglord rises in Bombay, 1998 However, prior to his involvement in petty crime, Budesh is known to have studied at a boarding school near Pune. Contact with Dawood Ibrahim While living in the slums near the Pankheshah Baba shrine at Ghatkopar (W), Budesh came into contact with some of Dawood Ibrahim's gang members who were on the run from the police, and sought shelter in the labyrinthine slums of the Vikhroli Parksite area. Budeshi was rewarded for his initial assistance of these men, when he was sent to Dubai and met Dawood Ibrahim, the infamous head of the D-Company and India's most wanted fugitive. Boss of his own gang Budesh later split from the D-Company, together with other key aides of Dawood Ibrahim such as the Pakistani smuggler Shoaib Khan, Irfan Goga, and Ijaz Pathan, and formed his own separate gang with its headquarters in Bahrain. He allied himself with some of Dawood Ibrahim's enemies and went on to lead them against him. These a feared gangster from Virar-Virar, Subhash Singh Thakur, who is currently lodged in New Delhi's Tihar Central Prison. Another former Ibrahim aide, Dilawar Khan, became Budesh's right-hand man. This alliance caused some major upsets to Ibrahim's declining empire. Informant He also began informing on members of the D-Company to law enforcement. The detention of Dawood Ibrahim's brother, Anees Ibrahim at the Bahrain International Airport at Muharraq in 1996 is believed to have been due to a tip-off from Budesh. Dawood spent over Rs 5 lakh for his brother's release. Similarly, the month-long incarceration of Abu Salem, another key underworld figure at the UAE's Al-Rafa detention centre was attributed to Budesh. Budesh also began informing on other Indian NRI gangsters such as Chhota Shakeel, Noora Ibrahim, etc., forcing them to flee the UAE for Pakistan, where they are believed to have made their base of operations in Karachi. Involvement in the extortion rackets In spite of the falling out with his former mentor, Budesh's policy in his extortion rackets closely follow Dawood Ibrahim's modus operandi. His targets include builders, diamond merchants and figures within the Bollywood film industry. His demands from builders include an annual fee or a few flats in their projects. From diamond merchants, he seeks deposits in numbered accounts in Swiss banks. However, the biggest contributors to his extortion racket have always been the Bollywood film figures. Those who usually refuse to pay the extortion money or hafta as it is called in the Mumbai underworld jargon, are dealt with in a severe manner. For instance, when Natwarlal Desai, a local Mumbai based builder refused to pay the hafta being demanded by Budesh's gang, he was later shot dead on 18 August 1997 at Nariman Point by the Budesh gang members. Those businessmen who were reluctant to pay the hafta to Budesh's enforcers, paid up with alacrity after the Desai killing. After this incident, no other killing by the Budesh gang was reported for a long time. On April, 1998, Keith Rodrigues, the chief steward at the Copper Chimney restaurant at Saki Naka was shot dead by Ali Budesh's gunmen. The murder was done as a warning to the restaurant's owner, Satish Bansal, who had been dodging Budesh's demand for Rs 5 lakh for months. Extorting Bollywood Some leading Bollywood film producers also became victims of Budesh's extortion tactics. He made threatening calls to Rakesh Roshan, Mukesh Bhatt and Boney Kapoor, and demanded up to 2 khokha (Rs. 2 crore) from each of them. The Tips Cassette Company owner, Ramesh Taurani, was also being extorted for the same amount.Bollywood under threat again On 21 January 2000, Rakesh Roshan was shot at by two Budesh gang members near his office on Tilak Road at Santacruz West. The assailants fired two bullets at him, one of which hit him on the left arm while the other grazed his chest. As the director fell to the ground, the assailants fled the scene.Rakesh Roshan shot at The assailants were later identified as Sunil Vithal Gaikwad and Sachin Kamble. The attack on Roshan was not undertaken with the intent to kill, but to signal that the Shiv Sena could no longer protect its clients. Roshan had stonewalled demands from Budesh for a percentage of the profits from the overseas sale of the Hindi blockbuster, Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai. Extorting politicians In 2018, several high-ranking Indian politicians claimed to have received extortion calls from Budesh.https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/bjp-ex- mla-gets-extortion-call-from-former-dawood-aide-ali- budesh/articleshow/64406504.cms Clashes with the law Budesh claimed responsibility for the hand-grenade attack near a hotel in Dahisar, a western suburb of Bombay on June, 1998. In the incident, some gangsters, when challenged, hurled the grenade at the police. In the blast and the subsequent police firing, two policemen and three gangsters were killed and several others were injured. However, Budesh's claim was dismissed by the Mumbai police.CID probe ordered into grenade attack on policemen The following year, Tirupati Kotian and Austin Carvalho, two members of the Ali Budesh gang were shot dead in an encounter with the Mumbai police at Kandivli.2 Budesh gangsters killed in encounter  Open war with Dawood Ibrahim  Budesh had a great falling out with Dawood over a property deal in Mumbai in 1997. Budesh, along with Uttar Pradesh don Subhash Singh Thakur, had hoped to extort money out of this deal from Natwar Lal Desai, a well known builder. However, Desai who had links with the D-Company, refused to pay them any cash and asked Dawood to intervene. This resulted in a verbal spat between the two dons. Dawood threatened Budesh on phone asking the latter to stay away from Desai, to which the latter did not respond well. According to the excerpts from a tape sent by Budesh to India Today in March 2010, he stated: In retaliation, Budesh and Thakur had Desai killed on 18 August 1997. In March 2010 Ali Badesh declared an open war against his former mentor, Dawood Ibrahim and his D-company, vowing to kill the former. Budesh has teamed up with underworld don Babloo Srivastava and launched Operation D against Dawood and his gang.Bahrain don Budesh challenges Dawood - 29 March 2010, India Today The duo are now being seen as the most deadly threat that the D-company has ever faced, bigger than even Dawood's arch-rival, Chhota Rajan. They are in fact accused by the Nepalese and Indian authorities of being behind the murders of Dawood's three main agents in Nepal, i.e., Majid Manihar, Parvez Tanda and Jamim Shah, Nepalese media entrepreneur who was reputed to be the architect of Dawood's counterfeit currency racket in India. Dawood is believed to have entrusted his chief lieutenant, Chhota Shakeel to deal with Budesh.

For most of his life he lived and practised in Limerick, and was later elected a member of the Royal Irish Academy (RIA).Ricorso Early life O'Halloran was the third son of Michael O'Halloran, a prosperous farmer at Caherdavin, County Limerick, and his wife Mary McDonnell. He was named after Sylvester Lloyd, the titular Catholic bishop of Killaloe in 1728‚Äì39. His mother's cousin Sean Claragh McDonnell taught him much at an early age, including some Greek and Latin. He went on to a Limerick school run by Robert Cashin, a Protestant clergyman, which was unusual at the time as the O'Hallorans were Roman Catholics during the difficult time of the Penal Laws. Sylvester and his brothers engaged successfully in areas of life that worked around the restrictions of the Penal Laws. Joseph became a Jesuit and held chairs in rhetoric, philosophy and divinity at the Jesuit College at Bordeaux in France. George became a jeweller and in time a property-owner. Sylvester went to London to learn medicine at the age of 17, particularly studying the methods of Richard Mead, as well as the oculists Taylor and Hillmer. After further study at Leyden, and in Paris under the anatomist and academician Antoine Ferrein, he set up practice as a surgeon in Limerick in early 1749.Lyons J.B. \\"Sylvestor O'Halloran\\", essay in \\"Eighteenth Century Ireland\\" (Journal) ISSN 0790-7915, volume 4 (1989) p.66. Career as surgeon O'Halloran wrote several learned treatises on medical matters, and his fame was acknowledged by his membership of the RIA in 1787. He was a founder of the County Limerick Infirmary that started with 4 beds in 1761 before moving to larger premises at St Francis's Abbey in 1765. The foundation stone of the original infirmary is now preserved in the Sylvester O'Halloran Post Graduate Centre at the Mid-Western Regional Hospital, Limerick.National Institute of Health Sciences: About Sylvester O'Halloran While in France, he had been very impressed with the Acad√©mie Royale de Chirurgie, which had been founded in Paris in 1731 during the reign of Louis XV. He was subsequently instrumental in founding the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI), by writing its blueprint, the Proposals for the Advancement of Surgery in Ireland in 1765. In 1780 he was made an honorary member of the new \\"Dublin Society of Surgeons\\", and when the RCSI received its charter in 1784 he was again elected an honorary member, equivalent to a Fellowship today.

In his last work O'Halloran contributes to Irish social history, as the head injuries he treated were often caused by fights aggravated by alcohol abuse. On page 4 he commented: :\\"...for our people, invincibly brave, notwithstanding the cruel oppressions they have suffered for a century past, and highly irritable, soon catch fire; a slight offence is frequently followed by serious consequences; and sticks, stones, and every species of offence next to hand, are dealt out with great liberality! To this add the frequent abuse of spirituous liquors, particularly whiskey, which has, unhappily for the morals and constitutions of the people, found its way to every part of the kingdom.\\" Student of Gaelic poetry As well as his scientific knowledge, O'Halloran's interest in the arts began with his collection of Gaelic poetry manuscripts and this led on to an interest in Irish history. Given his background, he argued to validate the pre-Norman history of Ireland which had often been dismissed as a period of barbarism. His correspondents included Edmund Burke on early history. With Charles O'Conor of Belanagare he discussed Macpherson's translated version of Ossian, and advised him about an eye complaint. In 1789 Charlotte Brooke published the first English-language compendium of Irish poetry, the seminal \\"Reliques of Irish Poetry\\", giving full due to O'Halloran for lending her his manuscript collection and for having written the essential history underlying her anthology. Critics As an early sympathetic historian of the Gaelic world in English, O'Halloran has faced criticism for being too sympathetic. In the 1770s a critic suggested he should: :drop any more scribbling, and mind the Systole and Diastole of the human body, which I suppose you are more acquainted with than history.Lyons, op cit., page 68. The historian JC Beckett (1912‚Äì96) included O'Halloran among those aiming: to vindicate its claims by uncritical admiration for the achievements of pre-Norman Ireland.A New History of Ireland vol. IV (Oxford, 1986) page lxi. Historical bibliography *An introduction to the study of the Antiquities of Ireland (1772) *Ierne Defended (1774) *A general history of Ireland (1778) Family life In 1752 Sylvester married Mary Casey and they had four sons and a daughter.

He lived in Lisbon, then one of Europe's most flourishing cities, where his brother was a rich merchant who owned a business that sold expensive silks and velvets on the fashionable Rue Novo do Mercadores. By all accounts, Fern√°ndez lived a comfortable life as was expected since as a caballero hidalgo, it was necessary for him to abstain from occupations that were considered less than noble. The nature of Spanish social structure was such that the gentry were expected to live life nobly, if they had the means to do so. Because of the family's wealth, young Juan of Cordoba was able to do just that. However, in his early twenties, these social distinction were about to become meaningless and his life was to turn in another direction. Conversion A fateful event changed his life forever when a friend invited him to visit a church to \\"hear some excellent music\\". Instead Fern√°ndez listened to a fiery sermon by the Jesuit priest, Francisco Estrada, on the Passion of Christ. Schurhammer describes the scene as being attended by some two hundred of the city‚Äôs most prominent men, and, \\"[w]hen it was ended, the lights were extinguished and the men in the church began to scourge themselves\\". The ceremony so affected Fern√°ndez, that soon thereafter he aspired to religious life and before too long he asked to be admitted to the Society of Jesus, only not as a priest, but as a temporal coadjutor or a lay brother in 1547. In a January 20, 1548, letter written from Cochin to Simon Rodrigues, Francis Xavier asked that more priests be sent to India and at the same time, described the physical and personal attributes necessary for missionary life in the Far East, writing, \\"I also earnestly beseech you for the love and service of God our Lord that when you arrange for the sending of some of the Society who are not preachers to these regions of India to convert the infidels, they be persons who have been well tried in the Society and have had much experience in gaining victories over themselves during the course of some years, and that they not be of poor health, since the labors in India require physical strength, even though spiritual strength is more important.\\" Simon Rodrigues must have concluded that the young brother was well suited for missionary work because on September 3, 1548, Brother Fern√°ndez arrived in Goa (the capital of the Portuguese India) from Portugal aboard the S√£o Pedro in the company of several of his Jesuit brethren. Missionary work in Japan In 1549, Fern√°ndez would accompany Francis Xavier and Father Cosme de Torres (1506‚Äì1576) on the first Christian mission to Japan which by its very nature was the first substantial cultural exchange between Europe and Japan. The early Jesuit missionaries arrived in Japan on August 15, 1549, on the Feast of the Assumption and spent their first year in Kagoshima, a port city on the southern tip of the island nation. There the first Japanese Christian community was formed and the Jesuits focused on learning the Japanese language and creating crude Christian books written in Japanese characters that explained basic tenets of Christian doctrine. The Jesuits moved on from Kagoshima and Xavier planned to convert to Christianity the emperor of Japan, which they hoped would result in a Constantine-style conversion of the entire island nation. Xavier believed also that since the Japanese held reason in high esteem, the Japanese would reason for themselves that to become a Christian would be the correct thing to do. Xavier anticipated that Japan would be the easiest Asian nation to convert. Jesuits missionaries later in the sixteenth century had high hopes that the complete conversion of the Japan would counterbalance the defection of England from the comity of Catholic nations. However, the mission to the emperor was unsuccessful since he spoke to no one except the most prominent members of Japanese society and instead the Jesuits turned their focus on the individual Christian conversion of the daimy≈çs, or Japanese warlords. In a letter from Portuguese Malacca, dated 20 June 1549, Francis Xavier begs the prayers of the Goa brethren for those about to start on the Japanese mission, mentioning among them Juan Fern√°ndez. On their arrival in Japan Juan was active in the work of evangelizing. In September, 1550, he accompanied Francis Xavier to Hirado, thence to Yamaguchi, and on to Kyoto. They returned to Yamaguchi, where he was left with Father Cosme de Torres in charge of the Christians, when Francis Xavier started for China. There was in the records of the Jesuit college at Coimbra a lengthy document, professed to be the translation of an account rendered to Francis Xavier by Fern√°ndez of a controversy with the Japanese on such questions as the nature of God, creation, the nature and immortality of the soul. The success of Brother Fern√°ndez on this occasion in refuting his Japanese adversaries resulted in the ill will of Buddhist priests, who stirred up a rebellion against the local daimy≈ç, who had become a Christian. The missionaries were concealed by the wife of one of the nobles until they were able to resume their work of preaching. Francis Xavier says in one of his letters: :\\"Joann Fern√°ndez though a simple layman, is most useful on account of the fluency of his acquaintance with the Japanese language and of the aptness and clearness with which he translates whatever Father Cosmo suggests to him.\\" His humility under pressure impressed all and on one occasion resulted in the conversion of a young Japanese doctor, who later became a Jesuit. Death and legacy In 1567, Brother Fern√°ndez died in Hirado, eighteen years after his arrival in Japan at the age of forty-one. Father Cosme de Torres who died in Shiki on the island of Amakusa on October 2, 1570, whom the Xavier biographer, Theodore Maynard, credits with saying of his fellow missionary: \\"If Japan has to thank Father Xavier for having brought her the faith, she has to thank Brother Fern√°ndez for its conservation after the departure of the saint.\\" See also *Chronology of European exploration of Asia References ;Attribution * 1567 deaths Spanish Jesuits Year of birth unknown Spanish Roman Catholic missionaries Roman Catholic missionaries in Japan Year of birth uncertain ","title":"Juan Fern√°ndez (missionary)"},{"id":"19162841","text":"Yunnanolepis is an extinct genus of primitive antiarch placoderm.

Life and work  One of South Africa's foremost painters, Cyril Fradan was born in Johannesburg in 1928. He was educated, and later lectured at the University of the Witwatersrand and held his first one-man show in Johannesburg in 1954. Relocating to London in 1960, Fradan exhibited successfully in most British and European art centres.ARTLOOK Johannesburg (January, 1968) p.11 Fradan worked almost exclusively in acrylic paints and made extensive use of glazing techniques. Furthermore, he was a successful and skilled exponent of the Baroque style used in contemporary, non-figurative terms. What this means is that Fradan blends illusion, light and colour, and a sense of passionate movement, all calculated to overwhelm the viewer by a direct emotional appeal. His use of such effects as the dissolved contour, the rendering of movement through flickering light, allied with his use of glowing colour, brought into being a style that had a profound effect on the South African audiences who saw it. Fradan rarely titled his paintings, believing that the images evoked in the spectator by the swirling, energetic forms in his canvases were, in fact, the correct ones. \\"Each viewer will see in my paintings what he wants to - I don't believe that the artist should interpose with titles, which are often misleading anyway.\\" As well as painting, Fradan provided costume designs for dramatic productions including the 1955 Margaret Inglis production of Shakespeare's Hamlet.Shakespeare Quarterly (Published by Folger Shakespeare Library, 1955) Additionally, he provided costume designs for the 1966 Gordon Crosse production of W. B. Yeats's Purgatory.The Musical Times (Published by Musical Times Publications Ltd., 1966) Fradan was a much- loved and well-respected member of the London arts scene. His annual summer music festivals held at his house at 23 Lower Addison Gardens, were a joy to music lovers and provided an opportunity to view his work. In his later years Fradan eschewed the art gallery scene, preferring his festival-based approach to sales of his increasingly popular paintings. He developed personal relationships with many of his patrons, who met regularly at his home; particularly during the festivals. Cyril Fradan left for Thailand in 1986, where he died in 1997 after successive operations to remove brain tumours.

Since his retirement he has been closely involved with the Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies, writing many book reviews, articles, and book chapters defending The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) from perceived critics.  Education and career  Midgley studied at the University of Utah for his bachelor's and master's degrees. He took an extended leave to serve as a missionary for the LDS Church in New Zealand 1950‚Äì1952. On his mission, he first encountered sectarian anti-Mormon arguments. He earned a PhD in political science from Brown University. His dissertation focused on Paul Tillich. Midgley taught political science, specifically, the history of political and legal philosophy, at Brigham Young University from 1960 until his retirement in 1996.  Apologetics  In the 1980s, Midgley, along with David Bohn and Neal Kramer, criticized practitioners of New Mormon History. Midgley called the New Mormon Histories an \\"act of treason\\" against the LDS faith since they did not take a stance on the LDS Church's truth claims. Midgley wrote that since objectivity in writing history is impossible, that Mormon historians ought to \\"defend\\" the faith. Midgley's argument was a familiar one, but his use of antipositivist rhetoric was unfamiliar to Mormon historians. Thomas G. Alexander responded, stating that positivism is a miscategorization, because New Mormon Historians usually accepted spiritual experiences like Joseph Smith's visions, rather than attributing them to mental illness or fabrication as a positivist might. Later, in his Dialogue article on the subject, John-Charles Duffy described Midgley's and Bohn's logic as antimodernist rather than postmodernist. Midgley often responded to arguments with a style one blogger referred to as \\"feisty.\\" David Bohn wrote an essay for Sunstone about Mormon historiography, which Thomas Alexander critiqued at length. Informed by this critique, Bohn rewrote portions of the essay, according to Alexander. Bohn's essay, \\"No Higher Ground,\\" was published in the May‚ÄìJune 1983 issue of Sunstone. Scott C. Dunn, an editor at Sunstone, stated that \\"a number of historians had gone to great lengths to discourage the publication of this manuscript [...] they sought to prevent distribution of ideas contrary to their own.\\" Midgley described the editorial interventions as censorship, which Alexander described as \\"intentional misrepresentation and obtuseness.\\" Alexander also accused Midgley of intentionally \\"misrepresenting the views of others.\\" Midgley was a frequent defender of Hugh Nibley and published a bibliography of Nibley's complete works. He contributed the article on theology to the Encyclopedia of Mormonism. In 2005-2006 Midgley served as editor of the FARMS Review. Other topics Midgley has studied included the abandonment of a belief in the Book of Mormon as an ancient document by members of the Community of Christ.

In past years, some also moved to the areas of Chicago, Illinois,\\"Barbadians\\", The Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago. and Boston, Massachusetts.Caribbean Heritage Association, Boston - History \\"Facts for Features: Caribbean-American Heritage Month, June 2013\\", United States Census Bureau. The first Barbadians in United States The first major wave of West Indian immigrants, including Barbadians, to the United States took place between 1901 and 1920, with a total of 230,972 entering the country. The majority were unskilled or semi- skilled laborers who came in search of economic opportunities. A substantial number were employed in low-paying service occupations and menial jobs that nonetheless offered higher wages than they could earn at home. Between 1931 and 1950 West Indian immigration to the United States declined, due partly to an immigration restriction law that imposed a quota system heavily weighted in favor of newcomers arriving from northern and western European countries. The Great Depression was another factor in the drop in West Indian immigration, which reached a significant low in the 1930s. A second wave began in the 1950s and peaked in the 1960s, when 470,213 immigrants arrived in the United States. More West Indians entered the United States during this decade than the total number that entered between 1891 and 1950. Between 1965 and 1976 a substantial number of immigrants from the Caribbean entered the United States, Barbados alone accounting for 17,400 of them. A large percentage of this wave of immigrants consisted of professional and technical workers forced to leave home because of limited economic opportunities in Barbados. Settlement Patterns  Most Barbadian immigrants tend to live in Philadelphia esp. in the North Philadelphia and the West Philadelphia sections, while even more settled widely in the New York City metropolitan area. The 1990 Census of Population Report shows that over 82 percent live in the Northeast, with over 62 percent in New York. More than 11 percent live in the South, approximately four percent live in the West, and almost two percent live in the Midwest. The five states with the highest Barbadian populations are New York, with 22,298; Massachusetts, with 3,393; Florida, with 1,770; New Jersey, with 1,678; and California, with 1,160. Unlike Chinese Americans or Italian Americans or Mexicans/Mexican Americans to compare, Barbadians‚Äîor West Indians, for that matter‚Äîdo not occupy small enclaves in the cities of America where they live. They instead tend to settle wherever they can find jobs or affordable housing, and they strive for upward mobility and opportunities to improve their lives. Barbadians along with other various Caribbean Americans follow the agricultural and even more in the landscaping, construction, domestics and hospitality industries of both Florida and urban industrial areas of the Northeast Corridor or Eastern Seaboard. In the 2000s, an estimated 100,000 Barbadian Americans live in the New York and Philadelphia areas. Traditions, Customs, and Beliefs Barbadians have a variety of traditions that are handed down from generation to generation, especially by word of mouth. Many traditions may be traced to Africa or Europe. Many Barbadian beliefs, however, are rooted in the country's own distinct culture. Employment and Economic Traditions Like most immigrants, Barbadian Americans come to America to \\"better themselves\\" economically. Over 82 percent settle in the Northeast region of the United States, 76 percent in New York state alone. Some find occupation in professional and technical fields, but the vast majority work as clerical workers, operators, craftsmen, foremen, sales workers, private household workers, service workers, managers, officials, foremen, and laborers; a very few work as farm managers and laborers. Because they believe in upward mobility, many Barbadians attend technical and professional schools and colleges, and they quickly qualify themselves for better paying jobs. Activism Prince Hall (1735?-1807) was an important black leader in the eighteenth century. Accounts of his birth, parentage, early life, and career vary, but it is widely accepted that Hall was born in Bridgetown, Barbados, in about 1735 to an English man and a woman of African descent, and that he came to America in 1765. Prince Hall was both an abolitionist and a Masonic organizer. Because of his organizing skill, a charter for the establishment of a lodge of American Negroes was issued on April 29, 1787, authorizing the organization in Boston of African Lodge No. 459, a \\"regular Lodge of Free and accepted Masons, under the title or denomination of the African Lodge,\\" with Prince Hall as master. Prince Hall was also an abolitionist and spokesman. He was one of eight Masons who signed a petition on January 13, 1777, requesting the Massachusetts state legislature to abolish slavery and declaring it as incompatible with the cause of American independence. He was later successful in urging Massachusetts to end its participation in the slave trade. He established the first school for colored children in his home in Boston in 1800. Hall ranks among the most significant black leaders in his day. Politics and Government  As early as the 1670s, Barbadians have contributed to American government. Many prominent Barbadians immigrated to Carolina during that decade, among them was Sir John Yeamans, who became governor of the colony that is known today as South Carolina. In the twentieth century, Shirley Chisholm, born in 1924 to Barbadian parents, became a politician of great stature in America. Although Chisholm was born in Brooklyn, New York, she spent the first 10 years of her life in Barbados, where she received much of her primary education under the strict eye of her maternal grandmother. She gave credit for her later educational success to the well-rounded early training she received in Barbados. In 1964 Chisholm ran for the New York State Assembly and won the election. She fought for rights and educational opportunities for women, blacks, and the poor. She served in the State Assembly until 1968, then she ran for the United States Congress. Chisholm won the election to the US House of Representatives and became the first black woman ever to be elected to the House, where she served with distinction from 1969 to 1982. In 1972 Chisholm made an unprecedented bid for the Presidential nomination of the Democratic Party. She was the first black and first woman to run for the presidency. She is also the founder of the chair of the National Political Congress of Black Women. Eric Holder, the 82nd United States Attorney General, has roots in Barbados. His father Eric Himpton Holder, Sr. (1905‚Äì1970) was born in St. Joseph, Barbados. His mother, Miriam, was born in New Jersey to parents who were immigrants from Saint Philip, Barbados. The Barbados government also maintains diplomatic and consular representation in a handful of American cities and towns. These include an Embassy in Washington, D.C., two Consulates-General in: Miami, New York City; a Permanent Mission to the United Nations in New York City; and is also further supported by a collection of Honorary Consulates in: Atlanta, Boston, Denver, Detroit, Houston, Los Angeles, Louisville, New Orleans, Portland, San Francisco, and Toledo.List of Barbadian Honorary Consulates (as of September 2011), Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade Barbados Notable People  See also *Barbados ‚Äì United States relations *West Indian Americans *Caribbean immigration to New York City References Further reading * Mulraine, Lloyd E. \\"Barbadian Americans.\\" Gale Encyclopedia of Multicultural America, edited by Thomas Riggs, (3rd ed., vol. 1, Gale, 2014), pp. 237‚Äì249. online External links * Council of Barbadian Organizations Inc.

In Rome he resided in the Palazzo di San Marco, as did the Venetian pope, who elected not to remove to the Vatican. From 1467 he was the cardinal patron of the Knights of Rhodes, for whom he built the loggia on the imperial forums.G. Fiorini, La casa dei cavallieri di Rodo (Rome, 1951:64ff, figs 63, 64). Instrumentum monitorium contra Johannes Vridach, Johannes von Sommeren, Komtur von Reval et sociis, 1490 At Paul's death, he was absent from Rome for several years; on his return he commissioned Paul's tomb from Mino da Fiesole, who completed it in 1477 for Old St. Peter's Basilica; fragments are conserved in the Vatican Museums. Barbo participated in the Papal conclave, 1471, which elected Pope Sixtus IV, for whom he served as legate to Germany, Hungary and Poland, with the charge, in which he was unsuccessful, of promoting a crusade against the Turks. He left Rome 22 February 1472 and went to the court of Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor, whom he was unable to inspire to combat the Ottoman Turks. Barbo returned to Rome 26 October 1474. Possessed of several abbacies in commendam, he was elected Camerlengo of the Sacred College of Cardinals and bishop of Palestrina (1478), where he restored the cathedral. His diplomacy defused the partisan tensions that were building in Rome before the conclave of 1484. For a price, he secured the Castel Sant'Angelo from Girolamo Riario and convinced both Orsini and Colonna factions to evacuate the city, leaving the conclave in security and peace.See Ludwig Pastor, The History of the Popes, from the Close of the Middle Ages, vol. V (1902:232). During the consistory, Barbo was one of those considered papabile; the election of Pope Innocent VIII was a compromise effected between cardinals Della Rovere and Rodrigo Borgia (later Pope Alexander VI) to block the candidacy of the Cardinal of St. Mark. Barbo was the eldest son of Marino Barbo and Filippa della Riva.Gaspare da Verona and Michael Canensius, Le vite di Paolo II (1904:216). He was an erudite patron of the humanists so distrusted by Paul II, but as chancellor of the Sapienza, he was constrained to withhold the salary of Pomponio Leto, who had fled to Venice.Vladimir Zabughin, Giulio Pomponio Leto, 1910-12. Marco Barbo assembled an outstanding library; generous and charitable, he distributed all his wealth to the poor of Rome at his death.

Executed in distemper on linen canvas, it measures . It depicts the Biblical parable of the blind leading the blind from the Gospel of Matthew 15:14, and is in the collection of the Museo di Capodimonte in Naples, Italy. The painting reflects Bruegel's mastery of observation. Each figure has a different eye affliction, including corneal leukoma, atrophy of globe and removed eyes. The men hold their heads aloft to make better use of their other senses. The diagonal composition reinforces the off-kilter motion of the six figures falling in progression. It is considered a masterwork for its accurate detail and composition. Copies include a larger version by Bruegel's son Pieter Brueghel the Younger, and the work has inspired literature such as poetry by Charles Baudelaire and William Carlos Williams, and a novel by Gert Hofmann. Bruegel painted The Blind the year before his death. It has a bitter, sorrowful tone, which may be related to the establishment of the Council of Troubles in 1567 by the government of the Spanish Netherlands. The council ordered mass arrests and executions to enforce Spanish rule and suppress Protestantism. The placement of Sint-Anna Church of the village Sint-Anna-Pede has led to both pro- and anti-Catholic interpretations, though it is not clear that the painting was meant as a political statement. Description The painting depicts a procession of six blind, disfigured men. They pass along a path bordered by a river on one side and a village with a church on the other. The leader of the group has fallen on his back into a ditch and, because they are all linked by their staffs, seems about to drag his companions down with him. A cowherd stands in the background. Bruegel demonstrates mastery of foreshortening in depicting the leader of the blind men. Bruegel based the work on the Biblical parable of the blind leading the blind from Matthew 15:14, in which Christ refers to the Pharisees. According to art critic Margaret Sullivan, Bruegel's audience was likely as familiar with classical literature as with the Bible. Erasmus had published his Adagia two years before Bruegel's painting, and it contained the quotation \\"\\" (\\"the blind leader of the blind\\") by Roman poet Horace. Bruegel expands the two blind men in the parable to six; they are well dressed, rather than wearing the peasant clothing that typifies his late work. The first blind man's face is not visible; the second twists his head as he falls, perhaps to avoid landing face-first. The shinguard-clad third man, on his toes with knees bent and face to the sky, shares a staff with the second, by which he is being pulled down. The others have yet to stumble, but the same fate seems implied. The faces and bodies of the blind men, and background detail including the church, are rendered in exceptionally fine detail. The backward-falling posture of the guide demonstrates Bruegel's mastery of foreshortening. Bruegel's settings tend to be fictional, but that of The Blind Leading the Blind has been identified as the village Sint-Anna-Pede, and the church as Sint-Anna Church. Style eyes have been removed. One of four surviving Bruegel paintings in distemper, the work is a t√ºchlein, a type of light painting that uses tempera made from pigment mixed with water-soluble glue. This medium was widely used in painting and manuscript illumination before the advent of oil paint. It is not known from whom Bruegel learnt its use, but amongst those speculated are his mother-in-law, illuminator Mayken Verhulst; his teacher Pieter Coecke van Aelst; and painter and illuminator Giulio Clovio, with whom he resided in Italy and whom he helped paint miniatures in distemper. Due to the high perishability of linen cloth and the solubility of hide glue, t√ºchleins do not preserve well and are difficult to restore. The Blind Leading the Blind is in good condition and has suffered no more than some erosion, such as of a herdsman and some fowl in the middle ground. The grain of the linen canvas is visible beneath the delicate brushstrokes. The work is signed and dated BRVEGEL.M.D.LX.VIII. The painting measures , the largest of 1568. The austere tone is achieved through pigments in a colour scheme of mostly greys, greens, brownish-reds, and blacks. The diagonal movement of the bodies creates a dramatic tension in the foreground which is divided diagonally from the landscape background. The flat country features are distinctly Flemish, unlike in most of Bruegel's landscapes, in which he introduced foreign elements such as mountain ranges even into local scenery. In contrast to earlier depictions of the blind as beneficiaries of divine gifts, Bruegel's men are stumbling and decrepit, and portrayed without sympathy. The eyeless figure would have been interpreted as a man who had suffered punishment for wrongdoing or fighting. Bruegel painted with the empirical objectivity of the Renaissance. In earlier paintings the blind were typically depicted with eyes closed. Here, Bruegel gives each man a different ocular affliction, all painted with a realism that allowed identification of their conditions by later experts, though there is still some diagnostic disagreement. French anatomical pathologist Jean-Martin Charcot and anatomical artist Paul Richer published an early account, ' (\\"The deformed and sick in art\\", 1889), and French pathologist Tony-Michel Torrillhon followed with more research on Bruegel's figures in 1957. The first man's eyes are not visible; the second has had his eyes removed, along with the eyelids: the third suffers from corneal leukoma; the fourth atrophy of the globe; the fifth is either blind with no light perception, or photophobic; and the sixth has pemphigus or bullous pemphigoid. Charcot and Richer noted Bruegel's accuracy in portraying the blind men facing not forward but with their faces raised in the air, as they would have had to rely on their senses of smell and hearing. The diagonal composition creates tension and gives a sense of movement. Background Bosch. Sixteenth-century Europe was undergoing many societal changes: the Protestant Reformation and its rejection of public religious imagery; Renaissance humanism and its emphasis on empiricism at the expense of religious faith; and the growth of the middle class amidst the rise of mercantilism. It was a time of rapid advances in learning and knowledge, and a move towards the empirical sciences‚Äîthe age of the heliocentric theory of Copernicus and of Gutenberg's printing presses. The cartography of Ortelius influenced the painting of landscapes, and the advances Vesalius brought to the study of anatomy via the direct observation of dissected bodies, motivated artists to pay greater attention to the accuracy of the anatomy in their works. Art was now traded in open markets; artists sought to distinguish themselves with subjects different from traditional noble, mythological, and Biblical ones, and developed new, realistic techniques based on empirical observation. Classical literature provided precedents for dealing with \\"low\\" subjects in art. Genre art and its depiction of ordinary people and everyday life emerged against this background. Pieter Bruegel the Elder began his career illustrating landscapes and fantastic scenes in a dense style that earned him a reputation as artistic heir to Hieronymus Bosch. He soon came to follow the example of another master, Pieter Aertsen, who had made a name for himself in the 1550s depicting everyday scenes in a highly realistic style, such as the detailed array of meat products that dominate his large Butcher's Stall of 1551. Bruegel's subjects became more quotidian and his style observational. He achieved fame for detailed, accurate and realistic portrayals of peasants, with whom his paintings were popular. He painted on linen canvas and oak panel, and avoided scenes of magnificence and portraits of nobility or royalty. The peasants Bruegel at first depicted were featureless and undifferentiated; as his work matured, their physiognomy became markedly more detailed and expressive. Pieter Aertsen pioneered painting the quotidian. A Meat Stall with the Holy Family Giving Alms, Aertsen, 1551 In 1563, Bruegel married Mayken, the daughter of his teacher Pieter Coecke van Aelst, and moved to Brussels, the seat of government in the Spanish Netherlands (1556‚Äì1714). In 1567 the governor of the Netherlands, the Duke of Alba, established the Council of Troubles (popularly called the \\"Blood Council\\") to suppress non- Catholic religions and enforce Spanish rule, leading to mass arrests and executions. Whether Bruegel had Calvinist sympathies or intended a political message in The Blind is not clear, but the evidence indicates he likely held views critical of the Catholic Church. A bitter, sorrowful tone characterizes his last works, such as The Blind and The Magpie on the Gallows. In ancient Greece the blind were depicted as having received gifts from the gods, and blind singers were held in high regard. In mediaeval Europe, the blind were depicted as the subjects of miracles, such as Bartimaeus in the healing the blind near Jericho in Mark 10:46‚Äì52. Following the Reformation, painted depictions of saints and miracles fell out of favour in Protestant areas. In Catholic thought, charitable works of mercy, such as giving alms to the blind and poor, were good works which, together with faith, helped the salvation of the doer. However, the Protestant doctrine of sola fide rejected the efficacy of works in achieving salvation, prescribing that it depended on faith alone (and the complication of God's predestined will for each individual). The status of charity for the poor and infirm diminished, and beggars saw their circumstances deteriorate. In popular literature of the time, the blind were depicted as rogues or targets of pranks. The parable of the blind leading the blind also appears as one of the illustrated proverbs in Bruegel's Netherlandish Proverbs (1559). Analysis Bruegel earlier depicted the blind leading the blind (inset) in Netherlandish Proverbs (1559). Charles Bouleau wrote of the tension in Bruegel's compositional rhythms. The picture is divided into nine equal parts divided by a set of parallel oblique lines. These are divided by another network of lines at constant angles to the first. The composition invites the reader to follow the action rather than dwell on the individual figures. The blind men resemble each other in dress and facial features, and they appear as if they succeed one another in a single movement culminating in a fall, beginning on the left with \\"rambling, then hesitation, alarm, stumbling, and finally falling\\". The succession of heads follows a curve, and the further the succession, the greater the space between heads, suggesting increasing speed. The steep roofs of the background houses contribute to the composition's feeling of motion. Art historian Gustav Gl√ºck noted incongruities in that the beggars are well-dressed and carry staves and full purses. Academics Kenneth C. Lindsay and Bernard Hupp√© suggest Bruegel may have implied that the blind men represent false priests who ignored Christ's admonitions not to carry gold, purses, or staves; the leader carries a hurdy-gurdy, a musical instrument associated with beggars in Bruegel's time; this perhaps implies a false minstrel, one who sings praises not for God. Sint-Anna Church in the village Sint-Anna-Pede. The inclusion of the church has led to conflicting interpretations of the painting. The church in the background, identified as the Sint-Anna Church at Dilbeek in modern Belgium, has sparked much commentary. One view holds that the church is evidence of the painting's moralistic intent‚Äîthat while the first two blind men stumble and are beyond redemption, the other four are behind the church and thus may be saved. Another interpretation has it that the church, with a withered tree placed before it, is an anti-Catholic symbol, and that those who follow it will fall following a blind leader as do the men in the ditch. Others deny any symbolism in the church, noting that churches frequently appear in Bruegel's village scenes as they were a common part of the village landscape. Medical researcher Zeynel A. Karcioglu suggests the church represents indifference to the plight of the handicapped. In contrast to the posed, static figures typical of paintings of the period, Bruegel suggests the trajectory of time and space through the accelerated movement of the figures. Critics Charcot and Richer wrote that the concept of visualizing movement was not formulated until the 17th century, and that Bruegel prefigures motion pictures and Duchamp's Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2. Karcioglu sees the painting as anticipating the 19th-century chronophotography of √âtienne-Jules Marey. Dutch film director Joris Ivens stated, \\"If Bruegel were alive today he would be a film director.\\" Legacy The Blind Leading the Blind has been considered one of the great masterpieces of painting. Bruegel's is the earliest surviving painting whose subject is the parable of the blind leading the blind, though there are earlier engravings from the Low Countries known that Bruegel was likely aware of, including one attributed to Bosch, and another by Cornelis Massijs. Bruegel's paintings have enjoyed worldwide popularity and have been the subjects of scholarly works in disciplines even outside the arts, such as medicine. Bruegel's depictions of beggars in paintings such as The Blind Leading the Blind left a strong influence on those who followed him, such as David Vinckboons. Hieronymus Wierix incorporated a copy of The Blind Leading the Blind into the series Twelve Flemish Proverbs. A forgery attributed to Jacob Savery called The Blind appeared bearing a false inscription dating it 1562. Bruegel's son Pieter Brueghel the Younger painted a larger copy in with extra details, including a flock of sheep, that hangs in the Louvre; this copy was in the collection of Ferdinando Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua, patron of Italian Baroque painter Domenico Fetti, who may have been influenced by the painting when he executed his own version of the parable around 1621‚Äì22.

American William Carlos Williams wrote a series of poems on Bruegel's paintings; his \\"Parable of the Blind\\" focuses on the meaning of The Blinds composition‚Äîa word that appears three times in the poems eight tercets. The figures stumble diagonally downward, and‚Äî Bruegel's painting served as a model for Belgian playwright Maurice Maeterlinck's one-act The Blind. West German writer Gert Hofmann's 1985 novel The Parable of the Blind features Bruegel and the six blind men: to accomplish a realistic portrayal, Bruegel repeatedly has the men cross a bridge and fall into a creek in midwinter until their expressions achieve the desolation Bruegel believes represents the human condition. A 1987 historical novel Bruegel, or the Workshop of Dreams by has Bruegel painting the blind out of fear of losing his own eyesight. French cartoonist F'Murr's comic strip Les Aveugles (1991) was inspired by Bruegel's painting.https://www.lambiek.net/artists/f/fmurr.htmhttps://www.lambiek.net/artists/b/bruegel_the_elder_pieter.htm Provenance The Blind Leading the Blind and The Misanthrope were discovered in the collection of the Count Giovanni Battista Masi of Parma in 1612, when Ranuccio I Farnese, Duke of Parma confiscated Masi's property for his part in a conspiracy against the House of Farnese. How the painting arrived in Italy is uncertain, though it is known that Masi's father Cosimo returned from the Netherlands in 1595 with a number of Netherlandish paintings. The Farnese art collection came to be one of the largest of the Renaissance era, divided amongst the Farnese residences in Parma and Rome. In the 18th century, Charles III of Spain inherited the collection from his mother, Elisabeth Farnese, heiress of the Duchy of Parma in north Italy, who became Queen consort of Spain. As a younger son, Charles had been made Duke of Parma, then boldly seized the Kingdom of Naples, becoming Charles VII of Naples, before inheriting the Spanish throne. Charles housed the collection in what is now the National Museum of Capodimonte in Naples. The painting hangs in the Capodimonte with The Misanthrope, as part of the Farnese collection.

He made the first electric motor. Life Andrew Gordon was born in Cofforach, Forfarshire. He was a son of an old Scottish aristocratic family and baptized with the name George. At the age of 12, he travelled to Regensburg, Bavaria, in order to study at the Benedictine Scottish Monastery. As a Catholic Scot, there was no possibility of getting entrance to higher offices in his homeland. In Regensburg, he completed a 5-year general education course of study. Abbott Bernhard Baillie made it possible for Gordon to make education journeys to Austria, France and Italy, in particular to Rome. Gordon returned to Regensburg in 1732. On 24 February 1732 he enrolled as a novice and received the name of \\"Andreas\\". In the monastery he began with the study of scholastic philosophy under Gallus Leith, who in 1735 at the Erfurter university was appointed as a Professor for Philosophy. Gordon studied intensely with the Dominican Iselbrecher, where he took also his theological disputation. In the same year Andreas Gordon was entered to the priesthood, afterwards he completed law studies at the Benedictine University of Salzburg, where he studied law and theology. In 1737 he completed his study in philosophy and theology with ‚Äúexcellence‚Äù and passed the legal exam with honours. Subsequently, he became a professor of philosophy at the University of Erfurt. Gordon soon acquired considerable reputation by his works on electricity, among which were Phaenomena electricitatis exposita (1744), Philosophia utilis et jucunda (1745) and Physicae experimentalis elementa (1751‚Äì52). For the sulphur ball of von Guericke (1671) and the glass globe of Isaac Newton (some say Hauksbee), Gordon substituted a glass cylinder which made an efficient frictional machine. Two other inventions in physics are noteworthy: the first is the light metallic star supported on a sharp pivot with the pointed ends bent at right angles to the rays and commonly called the electrical whirl, the second is the device known as the electric chimes. These inventions used to be described in textbooks of electricity; the name of Gordon was not always mentioned, though both inventions are fully described by him in his Versuch einer Erklarung der Electricitat (Erfurt 1745). Benjamin Franklin, who is usually credited with the latter invention, simply adopted the \\"German chimes\\" (described by Watson in his famous Sequel, 1746) to serve as an electrical annunciator in connection with his experimental lightning rod of 1752. The \\"whirl\\" was an electrostatic reaction motor, the earliest of its kind; while the second derives its theoretical importance as the first instance of the application of what came to be called electric convection.

The period of prehistory prior to occupation by the genus Homo is part of the geology of Scotland. Although some written records refer to Orkney during the Roman invasions of Scotland, prehistory in northern Scotland does not end until the commencement of the Early Historic Period around AD 600. There are numerous important prehistoric remains in Orkney, especially from the Neolithic period, four of which form a World Heritage Site. There are diverse reasons for the abundance of the archaeological record. The sandstone bedrock provides easily workable stone materials and the wind-blown sands have helped preserve several sites.Wickham-Jones (2007) p. 25. The relative lack of industrialisation and low incidence of ploughing also have helped to preserve these ancient monuments. Local tradition hints at both a fear and veneration of these ancient structures (perhaps inherited from the Norse period of occupation) that may have helped to retain their structural integrity.Moffat (2005) pp. 96-97.Hedges (1984) pp. 11-13, who states that the total number of archaeological sites in Orkney is \\"around 10,000\\" i.e. about 10 for every km2. Prehistory is conventionally divided into a number of shorter periods but differentiating these various eras of human history is a complex task - their boundaries are uncertain and the changes between them are gradual. The Paleolithic lasted until the retreat of the ice, the Mesolithic until the adoption of farming and the Neolithic until metalworking commenced. A number of the sites span long periods of time and in particular the distinctions between the Neolithic and the later periods are not clear cut.Moffat (2005) p. 147. The extraordinary wealth of structures from the Neolithic is not matched either by the early periods, for which the evidence of human occupation is sparse or non-existent, or the later Bronze Age which provides a relative dearth of evidence. The subsequent Iron Age supported a return to monumental building, especially of brochs. Formal excavations were first recorded in the late 18th century and as they proceeded an understanding of the structures involved progressed from little more than folklore to modern archaeological science. The sites discussed are found on the Orkney Mainland unless otherwise stated. Paleolithic No traces have yet been found in Scotland of either a Neanderthal presence or of Homo sapiens during the Pleistocene interglacials. The first indications of humans occur only after the ice retreated in the 11th millennium BC and the current Flandrian interglacial began. Since that time the landscape of Orkney has been altered by both human and natural forces.Edwards, Kevin J and Ralston, Ian B.M. \\"Environment and People in Prehistoric and Early Historical Times: Preliminary Considerations\\" in Edwards & Ralston (2003) p. 1. Initially, sea levels were lower than at present due to the large volume of ice that remained. This meant that the Orkney islands may have been attached to the mainland, as was the present-day island of Great Britain to Continental Europe. Much of the North Sea basin was also dry land until after 4000 BC. This would have made travel to northern Scotland relatively easy for early human settlers. The subsequent isostatic rise of land makes estimating post-glacial coastlines a complex task.Murray (1973) p. 69.Moffat (2005) pp. 46-50.Wickham-Jones (1994) p. 74 states that mesolithic travellers would have encountered a stretch of water when voyaging from mainland Scotland to Orkney.Brown, John Flett \\"Geology and Landscape\\" in Omand (2003) p. 13.

Neolithic The seaward walls of Knap of Howar The assemblage of monumental Neolithic structures in Orkney is without parallel in the United Kingdom and on the Orkney Mainland provides an entire landscape of features from this period. During this time, complex new societies came to the fore that were a radical departure from the earlier hunter-gatherers and which were capable of creating substantial structures. The Neolithic in Scotland lasted from approximately 4000 to 2200 BC and Orkney as a whole has nearly 3,000 identified Neolithic sites all told. British archaeologists have often interpreted this era as having two distinct phases; the Earlier Neolithic dominated by regional styles of pottery and architecture followed by a relatively abrupt change into the Later Neolithic characterised by new traditions found throughout the British Isles that incorporate structures on a grander scale. In the Orcadian context, there are definite developments during the Neolithic, but the changes are gradual and tend to build on earlier ideas rather than appearing to form two distinct periods.\\"Death and re-birth\\" Scotland.org.

This structure was inhabited for 900 years from 3700 BC but was evidently built on the site of an even older settlement. Unstan ware pottery pieces were found on the site, which was only discovered in the 1920s when this part of the coastline was exposed by gales and tides.Wickham-Jones (2007) p. 40.Armit (2006) pp. 31-33.\\"The Knap of Howar\\" Orkney Archaeological Trust.

Only the roofs, which were probably supported by timber or whalebone, would have been visible from the outside. In each case the stone dressers were erected so that they dominated the view on entering the house through the low doors and there are elaborate carvings of unknown meaning on some of the stones in the houses and passages. A variety of bone beads, pins and pendants and four carved stone balls were also discovered at the site, which was only revealed after a storm in the winter of 1850 ripped away the grass from a covering sand dune.

Enlargement and elaboration of burial cairns as the Neolithic progressed is a theme found throughout Scotland, and the move from simple and private tombs to larger structures, some with entrances apparently designed for public gatherings may also be linked to the emergence of landscape-scale ceremonial complexes.Noble (2006) pp. 137-39.

This small area has provided a rich archaeological heritage in a location that is relatively remote from both the main centres of population in Scotland and from more densely populated parts of Europe. However, it would be a mistake to imagine that because Orkney is so placed today that this was always so. There is a substantial amount of evidence that suggests that a variety of the smaller islands in the British Isles developed an advanced society in the Neolithic that took several centuries longer to develop on the mainland of Great Britain.Noble (2006) pp. 24-44. It is also clear that whilst the flow of ideas and technologies in Britain has often been from the south to the north, that at this time, it is evident that Orkney played a significant role in the development of British Neolithic culture. There is also the possibility that tribal differences were part of the Neolithic cultural landscape.

The Watch Stone stands outside the circle to the north-west and is high. Other smaller stones include a square stone like a huge hearth setting in the centre of the circle and this along with the bones of cattle, sheep, wolves and dogs found in the ditch suggest ritual sacrifice and feasting. Even in the 18th century the site was still associated with traditions and rituals, by then relating to Norse gods.

These are substantial stone towers that developed out of the roundhouse tradition in north and west Scotland, whose dry-stone walls may have reached in height. Although Orkney has no broch towers where the surviving walls are more than a few metres high, several important sites have been excavated which have numerous associated buildings forming a \\"broch village\\".Wickham-Jones (2007) p. 81-84. Midhowe Broch lies close to the chambered cairn of the same name on Rousay.

The Greek explorer Pytheas visited Britain sometime between 322 and 285 BC and may have circumnavigated the mainland. In his On the Ocean he refers to the most northerly point as Orcas, conceivably a reference to Orkney.Breeze, David J. \\"The ancient geography of Scotland\\" in Smith and Banks (2002) pp. 11-13. Broch of Gurness Remarkably, the earliest written record of a formal connection between Rome and Scotland is the attendance of the \\"King of Orkney\\" who was one of eleven British kings who submitted to the Emperor Claudius at Colchester in AD 43 following the invasion of southern Britain three months earlier.Moffat (2005) p. 173-4. The long distances and short period of time involved strongly suggest a prior connection between Rome and Orkney, although no evidence of this has been found and the contrast with later Caledonian resistance to Rome is striking.Moffat (2005) p. 174-6. Pomponius Mela, the Roman geographer, recorded in his De Chorographia, written c. 43 AD, that there were thirty Orkney islands.Breeze, David J. \\"The ancient geography of Scotland\\" in Smith and Banks (2002) p. 12. There is certainly evidence of an Orcadian connection with Rome prior to AD 60 from pottery found at the Broch of Gurness and 1st and 2nd century Roman coins have been found at Lingro broch.Moffat (2005) pp. 173-4.Thomson (2008) p. 5. The Roman presence in Scotland was however little more than a series of relatively brief interludes of partial military occupation.Hanson, William S. \\"The Roman Presence: Brief Interludes\\", in Edwards and Ralston (2003) pp. 195, 198. The military presence of Rome lasted for little more than 40 years for most of Scotland and only as much as 80 years in total anywhere. At no time was even half of Scotland's land mass under Roman control. As Roman influence waned in Scotland from 211 onwards,Hanson (2003) p. 198. Orkney faded from history again and the Celtic Iron Age way of life continued, largely unchanged.Hanson (2003) p. 216. \\"The Roman presence in Scotland was little more than a series of brief interludes within a longer continuum of indigenous development.\\" Pictish rule The tidal islet of Brough of Birsay In the centuries following Rome's excursions into Scottish territory Orkney was, at least for a time, part of the Pictish kingdom. Very little is known about the Pictish Orcadians, the main archaeological relics being symbol stones. One of the best examples is located on the Brough of Birsay; it shows 3 warriors with spears and sword scabbards combined with traditional Pictish symbols.Wickham-Jones (2007) pp. 106-07.Ritchie, Anna \\"The Picts\\" in Omand (2003) p. 39 This small tidal island has a long history of settlement that continued into the Norse period. Adomnan, the biographer of St Columba, states that there were Orcadians at the court of the Pictish High King, Bridei, in AD 565. These Orcadians were described as \\"hostages\\" which could imply difficult relations between Orkney and the king, although they may have simply been guests at the court.\\"A Brief History of Orkney: The Picts - 300-800AD\\". Orkneyjar. Retrieved 29 August 2008. A Pictish cemetery was found in the grounds of Skaill House (adjacent to Skara Brae) in 1996.Wickham-Jones (2007) p. 107. Christianity probably arrived in Orkney in the 6th century and organised church authority emerged in the 8th century. The Buckquoy spindle-whorl found at a Pictish site on Birsay is an Ogham-inscribed artefact whose interpretation has caused controversy although it is now generally considered to be of both Irish and Christian origin. Evidence associated with the St Boniface Church on Papa Westray suggests this island had been the seat of the Christian bishopric of Orkney in Pictish times.Wickham-Jones (2007) p. 108.Ritchie, Anna \\"The Picts\\" in Omand (2003) p. 42 The 8th century was also the time the Viking invasions of the Scottish seaboard commenced and with them came the arrival of a new culture and language for the Orkney islands. The Norse era has provided a variety of written records, the substantial Orkneyinga Saga amongst them and at this point the archipelago fully emerges into the historic era.Hedges (1984) pp. 11-12 repeats an old jest that the ongoing use of flagstones as a material meant that the Stone Age in Orkney lasted until the first few decades of the 19th century, which saw the introduction of cheap wooden furniture and cement. Archaeological history Formal excavations are first recorded at Earl's Knoll on Papa Stronsay in the Statistical Account of Scotland in 1795.\\"The Papar Project: Papa Stronsay\\" RCAHMS. Retrieved 1 September 2008. As with the Dwarfie Stane, the mound was assumed to be a giant's grave at the time. Following soon after this, work on the \\"Picts-house\\" (i.e. chambered tomb) at Quanterness commenced, but little else of note was achieved until the mid 19th century. F. W. L. Thomas, whose day job was as a Captain in the Royal Navy published The Celtic Antiquities of Orkney in 1852,Thomas, F. W. L. (1852) \\"Account of some of the Celtic antiquities of Orkney, including the Stones of Stenness, Tumuli, Picts-houses, etc. with plans\\" Archaeologia 34. pp. 88-136\\\\.

His hopes were met and about a dozen chambered tombs were worked on between 1849 and 1867 by James Farrer, R.J. Hebden and George Petrie. However, other than work at Unstan near Stromness there was then a lull for about six decades. Then, from the late 1920s, work recommenced with the assistance of the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland and the Ministry of Works. The most eminent archaeologist to work here at this time was Vere Gordon Childe. He was involved in excavations at Skara Brae and Rinyo, but it was only when a shard of pottery was discovered at the latter site that it became understood that these settlements dated to the Neolithic rather than the Iron Age.Childe, V.G. and Grant, Walter G. (12 December 1938) A Stone-Age Settlement at the Braes of Rinyo, Rousay, Orkney. (pdf) Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland. Retrieved 1 September 2008. A further 18 tombs were excavated before 1950, including five on Eday and one on the Calf of Eday and by the 1960s the outlines of a modern understanding of Orcadian prehistory had emerged. The advent of radiocarbon dating enabled even more detailed dates to be established and refuted earlier theories that the chambered tombs of Orkney had developed from similar structures found in the Eastern Mediterranean, such as those built by the Minoans, when it became clear that the former pre-dated the latter by a considerable margin.Hedges (1984) pp. 20-27.

Bryan Ingham at the Lizard, 1994 Early life Bryan Ingham was born at Preston on 11 June 1936 and raised at Totley in Yorkshire's Calder Valley, in one of its many terraced houses, and the surrounding moorlands, a landscape that profoundly marked his later artistic language. His father George was a sales rep for men's clothing, and his mother Alice took in sewing from time to time when the family finances required. He was unsuccessful academically at school, but had a warm family life; his uncle, Leslie Ingham, who lived for much of the time in the household, gave him an early exposure to and love of literature and music and as a result Ingham became very well read, with a particular zest for and knowledge of poetry. On leaving school he worked for a time in a department store and acquired an affection for the business's traditional standards and his fellow workers. He was an enthusiastic cricketer and had a trial for Yorkshire; it was he said one of his regrets that having been born in a hospital two or three miles into Lancashire he was disqualified from playing for the county but as he was not selected this remained purely a sentiment. His affection for his Yorkshire roots never left him. For his National Service he joined the RAF, and spent his time in Germany as an airman employed in a number of what he regarded as tedious tasks before ending up in charge of the stores at RAF Celle under a laissez-faire sergeant, where he became an enthusiastic operator of the ways and means act. On demob, his final report said \\"Ingham is an artistic sort of airman.\\" In his spare time he had started painting in oils, and by the time he left the RAF he had completed a large number of paintings. Career On his return from Germany, he announced to his parents that he intended to become a painter and his father's delight on thinking that he intended to be a painter and decorator was short-lived, to be replaced by bemused acceptance. Despite their misgivings, his parents supported Ingham staunchly through his early and later career, and his father's allowance paid Ingham's rent right through his college career. Training and teaching He went up to London's St Martin's School of Art, where he had the tuition of a fine post-war generation of teachers who helped him to hone his draughtsmanship and other skills, and he swiftly showed a capacity for painting that drew the attention of his tutors and peers. On graduating he was offered and accepted a post-graduate place at the Royal College of Art, where in his second year he was awarded a Royal Scholarship and was a contemporary of a number of now better-known names including David Hockney. He was establishing a reputation for bolshiness with his teachers, and in later years he admitted, a degree of arrogance. It did not stop his talent being appreciated by the staff including his director Carel Weight. It was at the RSA that he made his first acquaintance with etching. Ingham was to become one of the most notable etchers of the second half of the 20th century, remarkable for the size and quality of his plates, which he often attacked in a style he called \\"quarrying.\\" He was by then established himself in a fine studio in Fournier St, off Brick Lane and teaching part of the time at Maidstone College of Art, enjoying among others the company of Quentin Crisp, who was a life model there at the time, particularly on the train journeys up and down from London. Travels in Italy Ingham had been fascinated by Italy since his youth, undeterred by an early and disastrous visit with Leslie, who during the trip started the descent into the madness that ultimately led to his suicide. Ingham applied for and received a Leverhulme travel award to explore the sites of the great Renaissance painters, and spent many happy months engaged in this expedition, and as a parenthesis turned up at the English Art school in Rome, where he lived well and busied himself the same studio that Barbara Hepworth had used. Settling in Cornwall At this stage of his career, Ingham consciously rejected the prospect of pursuing a career as an establishment artist, although the RA was open to him, and he went to live in remote cottage on the west side of Predannack Airfield on The Lizard, a location yards from the cliffs and devoid of electricity and running water. He was to keep the cottage for the rest of his life. The subsequent years were varied and highly productive, and Ingham's personal artistic voice emerged in his oeuvre in the form of an always-developing dialogue with influences both of landscape and other artists of every age. His preoccupation with etching resulted in several hundred plates, some very large, and the results are as unmistakable as they are varied, but invariably of outstanding quality. He produced a number of sculptures in bronze and in plaster, while his lifelong output of paintings remained small but again of very high quality. He taught etching regularly until about 5 years before his death, latterly at Falmouth Art School, and also at Farnham Art College. His trips to London, always dapper in country suit and bow-tie, on selling expeditions, were usually successful and always convivial, ritually ending with a very hot curry and the sleeper back to Penzance. Ingham was great raconteur and had a facility for friendship surprising for one who led what was for the most part a reclusive life. He had many love affairs over the years, two of which were long-term relationships and he was married in 1989 (marriage dissolved 1994) to Aysel √ñzakƒ±n, a writer and poet of Turkish/British nationality, who figures in a number of his etchings and portraits of the period. The earlier of these relationships, with Stella Benjamin, brought him over to St Ives where for some years he had a studio in Back Road West. He always retained his Lizard retreat, and indeed for a long time his Fournier St studio. German connection In the late 80s a chance meeting on the Lizard coast path with some German visitors, Sigrid and Uwe Martin, resulted in an invitation to spend time on a bursary on the north German coast at Worpswede, where he felt very much at home and to which he returned regularly thereafter. His new friends persuaded him to undergo surgery to improve his lifelong deafness. The success of this resulted, among other benefits, in a new foray into colour in his work. His stays here stimulated him to produce much fine work including for the first time a number of collages. His work was admired in Germany and he was always sure of regular and lucrative informal shows there. The Kunsthalle held an exhibition of his work. Later life and death During the late eighties he established a relationship with Francis Graham-Dixon, the art dealer, who at that time had a London gallery. This meant that his paintings were professionally marketed for the first time, and prices for his work rose steadily in the last ten years of his life, and subsequently. He purchased a cottage in Helston for his parents, who lived there until their deaths. His friendship with Josephine Gooden resulted in his conversion of a barn adjoining her Lizard farmhouse and he lived there for some years in more comfort than in his cottage which he nonetheless always retained. He moved from there into a fine set of barn-type studios with a patch of garden, a former orchard, quietly situated off the High St in Helston, and it was here, on 22 September 1997, that he died, having stoically endured cancer for nearly a year. His paintings are in many public and private collections in the UK, Germany and elsewhere. During his final six months he recorded a memoir and artistic testament in the course of a number of conversations. These include an remarkable disquisition on the craft of the etcher that concludes: \\"There is the argument that by going down many false paths one has enriched one's vocabulary, if only minimally, but positively enriched it. That is one reason why the best of my later etchings are strong. And inimitable, because nobody else has gone up and down those various pathways. Because most people have chosen to stick to just one pathway, not the pathways of construction, collage, oil painting, drawing, etching lithograph and of their various components. I've been up and down a hell of a lot of pathways. If one had another lifetime, another sixty years, to work, one would certainly do startling work. But it's taken all of that time just to arrive at the beginning. I feel that about my etching. I feel that about my painting, and to a lesser extent about my sculpture. Well, that's an apprenticeship, and a good apprenticeship. But should an apprenticeship last 45 years?\\" External links * Obituary in The Guardian 5th Sept 97 by Jonathan Wynne Evans *Bryan Inghams own words in his Memoir Bryan Ingham biography at David Case Fine Art * Biography at Goldmarkart.com *Bryan Ingham (Biographical details) at the British Museum * Bryan Ingham (1996-1937) Biography at modernprints.co.uk * [Brian Ingham https://books.google.com/books?id=05C02RhJZCkC&lpg;=PA602&ots;=QJsndUcP90&dq;=%22bryan%20ingham%22%20%20artist&pg;=PA602#v=onepage&q;=%22bryan%20ingham%22%20%20artist&f;=false] entry in Benezit Dictionary of British Graphic Artists and Illustrators, Volume 1 1936 births 1997 deaths English etchers 20th-century English painters English male painters English sculptors English male sculptors Alumni of Saint Martin's School of Art 20th-century British sculptors 20th-century British printmakers Royal Air Force airmen ","title":"Bryan Ingham"},{"id":"19163098","text":"William Austin Chatfield is an American government executive and lobbyist who served as the 11th Director of Selective Service from November 29, 2004 to May 29, 2009, having been nominated by President George W.

Alfred W. Hallett (1914‚Äì1986) was an English painter, who spent most of his adult life in north India. Life Early life Hallett wanted to study art from the time he was young but his parents were members of the Exclusive Brethren sect and his mother faced excommunication for encouraging him. He studied in London, and exhibited in two Summer Exhibitions in 1937 and 1939 at the Royal Academy, London, although he never became a Royal Academician.Royal Academy of Arts (Great Britain), Royal Academy Exhibitors 1905-1970: A Dictionary of Artists and their Work in the Summer Exhibitions of the Royal Academy of Arts, Trowbridge, Redwood Burn, 1973, vol. 3, p. 235. India In 1938, he was invited to India to paint by the Kashmiri owner of Nedou's Hotel in Srinigar. He offered his services to the British Government during World War II, but refused to take up arms. He was given a job as a censor, and rose to the position of Chief Censor in the Punjab. He became the manager of sales and design after the war for the New Egerton Woollen Mills (established in 1880) in Dhariwal, Punjab, which produced woollen worsted and hosiery of all kinds. He was close friends with the accountant, Kim Butterworth and his wife Jean. After the end of the war, Hallett decided to stay in India. After the Partition of India in 1947 he and the Butterworth family frequently went on camping trips together in the mountains during the summers. They finally bought a church property previously used for furloughs by missionaries at Dharamkot, set amongst snow-capped mountains in beautiful deodar forests, well above McLeod Ganj, Dharamsala, at an altitude of about 2,200 metres (7,218 feet). He was a keen gardener and developed a friendship with the 14th Dalai Lama with whom he used to share cuttings, seeds and gardening tips. In later years he repaired a lovely stone cottage, known as \\"Carlton Cottage\\" on his property which he rented to foreigners to generate some income. The house had been built by a retired English Major in the 1840s, who had originally tried to establish a strawberry farm nearby, but it was badly damaged in the massive and deadly 1905 Kangra earthquake. He died at his home in Dharamkot on 26 April 1986. Work Hallett was well known for his portraits, landscape and flower paintings some of which are exhibited at the Naam Art Gallery in the small rural locality of Sidhbari, near Dharamshala in the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh. He also painted imaginative religious and abstract paintings, some of which may be seen in the Catholic Church and school in Amritsar.

Clark was with Queen Henrietta's Men during the first and most significant phase of their existence, from 1625 to 1636. Like some other actors of English Renaissance theatre, Clark began as a boy player filling female roles. He played Gratiana in Shirley's The Wedding in 1626, and Bess Bridges in both parts of Heywood's The Fair Maid of the West in 1630-31\\\\. Not long after that time, though, Clark switched to adult male roles. He played Syphax and Nuntius in Nabbes's Hannibal and Scipio (1635), and Hubert in Davenport's King John and Matilda.

It is based on the 1940 novel, Landfall: A Channel Story, written by author Nevil Shute. Synopsis A British Coastal Command pilot in world War II, Rick, based near Portsmouth, sinks what he believes to be a German submarine, unaware that a British submarine is also in that part of the Channel. When it emerges that the British submarine has been lost with all hands, an enquiry is held and it is concluded by the senior Naval officer that Rick mistakenly attacked a British submarine in a friendly fire incident. The Naval Court of Inquiry finds that the captain of the submarine was principally at fault for poor navigation: Rick is officially criticized for having failed to properly visually identify his target. Although his RAF Commanding Officer disagrees with the Court's finding and encourages Rick to stay with the squadron, Rick requests another posting. Meanwhile, his fianc√© Mona, who works as a barmaid, overhears information which might help to uncover what really happened to the British submarine in the Channel. She brings this information to the Navy, who re-open the investigation and find that the German submarine torpedoed the British submarine and took its place, running on the surface until sunk by Rick. In the interim, Rick's new posting is a dangerous flying duty testing a new type of guided bomb for the Navy. His aircraft crashes and he is critically injured. He is met at the hospital by the Naval Captain who originally found against him to tell him that he was exonerated in the re- opened enquiry.

It is usually fitted with a shoulder strap or means for fastening it to a belt, and may be covered with a cloth bag and padding to protect the bottle and insulate the contents. If the padding is soaked with water, evaporative cooling can help keep the contents of the bottle cool. Many canteens also include a nested canteen cup. Primitive canteens were sometimes made of hollowed-out gourds, such as a calabash, or were bags made of leather. Later, canteens consisted of a glass bottle in a woven basket cover. The bottle was usually closed with a cork stopper. Designs of the mid-1900s were made of metal -- tin-plated steel, stainless steel or aluminum -- with a screw cap, the cap frequently being secured to the bottle neck with a short chain or strap to prevent loosening. These were an improvement over glass bottles, but were subject to developing pinhole leaks if dented, dropped or bumped against jagged rocks. Contemporary designs are almost exclusively made of one of several types of plastics, especially polyethylene or polycarbonate. They are typically as light as, or lighter than, their metal equivalents and are quite resistant to developing leaks, even when dropped or severely bumped. Hunter- gatherers in the Kalahari used ostrich eggshells as water containers, puncturing a hole in them to enable them to be used as canteens. The presence of such eggshells dating from the Howiesons Poort period of the Middle Stone Age at Diepkloof Rock Shelter in South Africa suggests canteens were used by humans as early as 60,000 years ago.Texier PJ, Porraz G, Parkington J, Rigaud JP, Poggenpoel C, Miller C, Tribolo C, Cartwright C, Coudenneau A, Klein R, Steele T, Verna C.

It offers an enterprise platform for integrating application programming interfaces (APIs), applications, and web services locally and across the Internet.  History  WSO2 was founded by Sanjiva Weerawarana, Paul Fremantle and Davanum Srinivas in August 2005, backed by Intel Capital, Toba Capital, and Pacific Controls. Weerawarana was an IBM researcher and a founder of the Web services platform. He led the creation of IBM SOAP4J, which later became Apache SOAP, and was the architect of other notable projects. Fremantle was one of the authors of IBM's Web Services Invocation Framework and the Web Services Gateway. An Apache member since the original Apache SOAP project, Freemantle oversaw the donation of WSIF and WSDL4J to Apache and led IBM's involvement in the Axis C/C++ project. Fremantle became WSO2's chief technology officer (CTO) in 2008, and was named one of Infoworld's Top 25 CTOs that year. In 2017, Tyler Jewell took over as CEO. In 2019, Vinny Smith became the Executive Chairman. WSO2's first product was code-named Tungsten, and was meant for the development of web applications. Tungsten was followed by WSO2 Titanium, which later became WSO2 Enterprise Service Bus (ESB). In 2006, Intel Capital invested $4 million in WSO2, and continued to invest in subsequent years. In 2010, Godel Technologies invested in WSO2 for an unspecified amount, and in 2012 the company raised a third round of $10 million. Official WSO2 records point to this being from Toba Capital, Cisco and Intel Capital. In August 2015, a funding round led by Pacific Controls and Toba raised another $20 million. The company gained recognition from a 2011 report in Information Week that eBay used WSO2 ESB as a key element of their transaction-processing software. Research firm Gartner noted that WSO2 was a leading competitor in the application infrastructure market of 2014. As of 2019, WSO2 has offices in: Mountain View, California; New York City; London, UK; S√£o Paulo, Brazil; Sydney, Australia; Berlin, Germany and Colombo, Sri Lanka. The bulk of its research and operations are conducted from its main office in Colombo. A subsidiary, WSO2Mobile, was launched in 2013, with Harsha Purasinghe of Microimage as the CEO and co- founder. In March 2015, WSO2.Telco was launched in partnership with Malaysian telecommunications company Axiata, which held a majority stake in the venture. WSO2Mobile has since been re-absorbed into its parent company. Historically, WSO2 has had a close connection to the Apache community, with a significant portion of their products based on or contributing to the Apache product stack. Likewise, many of WSO2's top leadership have contributed to Apache projects. In 2013, WSO2 donated its Stratos project to Apache. Products WSO2 products are released under the Apache License Version 2. Like the Apache project itself, WSO2 follows open development principles and publishes architecture and development discussions on public mailing lists. WSO2 offers a platform of middleware products for agile integration, application programming interface (API) management, identity and access management, and smart analytics. In June 2015, WSO2 announced software as a service versions of its open-source products.

Methods of detection include hydrostatic testing, infrared, and laser technology after pipeline erection and leak detection during service. Pipeline networks are the most economic and safest mode of transportation for oil, gases and other fluid products. As a means of long-distance transport, pipelines have to fulfill high demands of safety, reliability and efficiency. If properly maintained, pipelines can last indefinitely without leaks. Some significant leaks that do occur are caused by damage from nearby excavation, but most leaks are caused by corrosion and equipment failure and incorrect operation.https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/data-and-statistics/pipeline/distribution- transmission-gathering-lng-and-liquid-accident-and-incident-data If a pipeline is not properly maintained, it can corrode, particularly at construction joints, low points where moisture collects, or locations with imperfections in the pipe. Other reasons for leaks include exterior force damage (such as damage by cars and drilling rigs) and natural force (such as earth movement, heavy rain and flooding, lightening, and temperature).https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/data-and- statistics/pipeline/distribution-transmission-gathering-lng-and-liquid- accident-and-incident-data The most common leak detection method for pipeline operators is called the Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) system. This system uses a series of sensors to track data such as pressure, flow rates, temperature, and whether valves are open or closed. The sensors relay the information to a control room where operators determine the legitimacy of the leak alarms. Some systems have added the Computational Pipeline Monitoring System (CPM), whose main task is to detect leaks. These systems have been reported by pipeline operators to the US Department of Transportation's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration to be inefficient in leak detection. Even with these in place, the SCADA system is reported to have detected only 19% of leaks, and the CPM system only detecting 10% of leaks. https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-pipelines-colonial- analysis/technology-designed-to-detect-u-s-energy-pipeline-leaks-often-fails- idUSKCN1200FQ#:~:text=The%20most%20common%20leak%20detection,valves%20are%20open%20or%20closedhttps://www.phmsa.dot.gov/data- and-statistics/pipeline/distribution-transmission-gathering-lng-and-liquid- accident-and-incident-data The primary purpose of leak detection systems (LDS) is to help pipeline controllers to detect and localize leaks. LDS provide alarms and display other related data to the pipeline controllers to assist decision-making. Pipeline leak detection systems can also enhance productivity and system reliability thanks to reduced downtime and inspection time. According to the API document \\"RP 1130\\", LDS are divided into internally based LDS and externally based LDS. Internally based systems use field instrumentation (for example flow, pressure or fluid temperature sensors) to monitor internal pipeline parameters. Externally based systems use a different set of field instrumentation (for example infrared radiometers or thermal cameras, vapor sensors, acoustic microphones or fiber-optic cables) to monitor external pipeline parameters.  Rules and regulations  Some countries formally regulate pipeline operation.  API RP 1130 \\"Computational Pipeline Monitoring for Liquids\\" (US)  This recommended practice (RP)API RP 1130 (2007): Computational Pipeline Monitoring for Liquids. 1st Edition (September 2007). American Petroleum Institute. focuses on the design, implementation, testing and operation of LDS that use an algorithmic approach. The purpose of this recommended practice is to assist the Pipeline Operator in identifying issues relevant to the selection, implementation, testing, and operation of an LDS.  TRFL (Germany)  TRFL is the abbreviation for \\"Technische Regel f√ºr Fernleitungsanlagen\\" (Technical Rule for Pipeline Systems).TRFL (2003): Technische Regel f√ºr Fernleitungen (Technical Rule For Pipelines). The TRFL summarizes requirements for pipelines being subject of official regulations. It covers pipelines transporting flammable liquids, pipelines transporting liquids that are dangerous for water, and most of the pipelines transporting gas. Five different kinds of LDS or LDS functions are required: * Two independent LDS for continuous leak detection during steady-state operation. One of these systems or an additional one must also be able to detect leaks during transient operation, e.g. during start-up of the pipeline * One LDS for leak detection during shut-in operation * One LDS for creeping leaks * One LDS for fast leak location  Requirements  API 1155API 1155 (1995): Evaluation Methodology for Software Based Leak Detection Systems. 1st Edition (February 1995). American Petroleum Institute. Replaced by API RP 1130.(replaced by API RP 1130) defines the following important requirements for an LDS: * Sensitivity: An LDS must ensure that the loss of fluid as a result of a leak is as small as possible. This places two requirements on the system: it must detect small leaks, and it must detect them quickly. * Reliability: The user must be able to trust the LDS. This means that it must correctly report any real alarms, but it is equally important that it does not generate false alarms. * Accuracy: Some LDS are able to calculate leak flow and leak location. This must be done accurately. * Robustness: The LDS should continue to operate in non-ideal circumstances. For example, in case of a transducer failure, the system should detect the failure and continue to operate (possibly with necessary compromises such as reduced sensitivity).  Steady- state and transient conditions  During steady-state conditions, the flow, pressures, etc. in the pipeline are (more or less) constant over time. During transient conditions, these variables may change rapidly. The changes propagate like waves through the pipeline with the speed of sound of the fluid. Transient conditions occur in a pipeline for example at start-up, if the pressure at inlet or outlet changes (even if the change is small), and when a batch changes, or when multiple products are in the pipeline. Gas pipelines are almost always in transient conditions, because gases are very compressible. Even in liquid pipelines, transient effects cannot be disregarded most of the time. LDS should allow for detection of leaks for both conditions to provide leak detection during the entire operating time of the pipeline.  Internally based LDS  Overview about internally based LDS. Internally based systems use field instrumentation (e.g. for flow, pressure and fluid temperature) to monitor internal pipeline parameters which are used to detect possible leaks. System cost and complexity of internally based LDS are moderate because they use existing field instrumentation. This kind of LDS is used for standard safety requirements.Geiger, G., Werner, T., Matko, D. (2003): Leak Detection and Locating ‚Äì A Survey. 35th Annual PSIG Meeting, 15‚Äì17 October 2003, Bern, Switzerland.  Pressure/flow monitoring  A leak changes the hydraulics of the pipeline, and therefore changes the pressure or flow readings after some time. Local monitoring of pressure or flow at only one point can therefore provide simple leak detection. As it is done locally it requires in principle no telemetry. It is only useful in steady-state conditions, however, and its ability to deal with gas pipelines is limited.Geiger, G. (2008): Principles of Leak Detection. 1st Edition (September 2008). Krohne Oil & Gas, Breda (The Netherlands).  Acoustic pressure waves  The acoustic pressure wave method analyses the rarefaction waves produced when a leak occurs. When a pipeline wall breakdown occurs, fluid or gas escapes in the form of a high velocity jet. This produces negative pressure waves which propagate in both directions within the pipeline and can be detected and analyzed. The operating principles of the method are based on the very important characteristic of pressure waves to travel over long distances at the speed of sound guided by the pipeline walls. The amplitude of a pressure wave increases with the leak size. A complex mathematical algorithm analyzes data from pressure sensors and is able in a matter of seconds to point to the location of the leakage with accuracy less than 50 m (164 ft). Experimental data has shown the method's ability to detect leaks less than 3mm (0.1 inch) in diameter and operate with the lowest false alarm rate in the industry ‚Äì less than 1 false alarm per year.Avateq Corp. Press Release. New Leak Detection and Monitoring Technology Ensures Safety of Pipelines. However, the method is unable to detect an ongoing leak after the initial event: after the pipeline wall breakdown (or rupture), the initial pressure waves subside and no subsequent pressure waves are generated. Therefore, if the system fails to detect the leak (for instance, because the pressure waves were masked by transient pressure waves caused by an operational event such as a change in pumping pressure or valve switching), the system will not detect the ongoing leak.  Balancing methods  These methods base on the principle of conservation of mass. In the steady state, the mass flow \\\\dot{M}_I entering a leak-free pipeline will balance the mass flow \\\\dot{M}_O leaving it; any drop in mass leaving the pipeline (mass imbalance \\\\dot{M}_I - \\\\dot{M}_O) indicates a leak. Balancing methods measure \\\\dot{M}_I and \\\\dot{M}_O using flowmeters and finally compute the imbalance which is an estimate of the unknown, true leak flow. Comparing this imbalance (typically monitored over a number of periods) against a leak alarm threshold \\\\gamma generates an alarm if this monitored imbalance. Enhanced balancing methods additionally take into account the change rate of the mass inventory of the pipeline. Names that are used for enhanced line balancing techniques are volume balance, modified volume balance, and compensated mass balance.  State-observer-based methods  These methods are based on state observers which are designed from fluid mathematical models expressed in state-space representation. These methods can be classified into two types: infinite- dimensional observers and finite-dimensional observers. The first type is based on a couple of quasi-linear hyperbolic partial differential equations: a momentum and a continuity equations that represent the fluid dynamics in a pipeline. The finite-dimensional observers are constructed from a lumped version of the momentum and a continuity equations. Several types of observers have been used for leak detection, for instance Kalman filtersBenkherouf, A., & Allidina, A. Y. (1986). Leak Detection Methods for Gas Pipelines.

Model based pipeline monitoring with leak detection. IFAC Proceedings Volumes, 40(12), 318-323..  Statistical methods  Statistical LDS use statistical methods (e.g. from the field of decision theory) to analyse pressure/flow at only one point or the imbalance in order to detect a leak. This leads to the opportunity to optimise the leak decision if some statistical assumptions hold. A common approach is the use of the hypothesis test procedure :\\\\text{Hypothesis }H_0:\\\\text{ No leak} :\\\\text{Hypothesis }H_1:\\\\text{ Leak} This is a classical detection problem, and there are various solutions known from statistics.Berger, J.O. (1985): Statistical Decision Theory and Bayesian Analysis. Springer Series in Statistics. 2nd Edition (1985).  RTTM methods  RTTM means \\"Real-Time Transient Model\\". RTTM LDS use mathematical models of the flow within a pipeline using basic physical laws such as conservation of mass, conservation of momentum, and conservation of energy. RTTM methods can be seen as an enhancement of balancing methods as they additionally use the conservation principle of momentum and energy. An RTTM makes it possible to calculate mass flow, pressure, density and temperature at every point along the pipeline in real-time with the help of mathematical algorithms. RTTM LDS can easily model steady-state and transient flow in a pipeline. Using RTTM technology, leaks can be detected during steady-state and transient conditions. With proper functioning instrumentation, leak rates may be functionally estimated using available formulas.http://www.cincinnati-test.com/cin_leak_calculator.php  E-RTTM methods  Signal flow Extended Real-Time Transient Model (E-RTTM). E-RTTM stands for \\"Extended Real-Time Transient Model\\", using RTTM technology with statistical methods. So, leak detection is possible during steady-state and transient condition with high sensitivity, and false alarms will be avoided using statistical methods. For the residual method, an RTTM module calculates estimates \\\\hat{\\\\dot{M}}_I, \\\\hat{\\\\dot{M}}_O for MASS FLOW at inlet and outlet, respectively. This can be done using measurements for pressure and temperature at inlet (p_I, T_I) and outlet (p_O, T_O). These estimated mass flows are compared with the measured mass flows \\\\dot{M}_I, \\\\dot{M}_O, yielding the residuals x=\\\\dot{M}_I - \\\\hat{\\\\dot{M}}_I and y=\\\\dot{M}_O - \\\\hat{\\\\dot{M}}_O. These residuals are close to zero if there is no leak; otherwise the residuals show a characteristic signature. In a next step, the residuals are subject of a leak signature analysis. This module analyses their temporal behaviour by extracting and comparing the leak signature with leak signatures in a database (\\"fingerprint\\"). Leak alarm is declared if the extracted leak signature matches the fingerprint.  Externally based LDS  Thermal camera system with video analysis software detecting an oil leak from a valve at 50 feet and 150 feet in heavy rain. Externally based systems use local, dedicated sensors. Such LDS are highly sensitive and accurate, but system cost and complexity of installation are usually very high;Leak Detection and Locating ‚Äì A Survey by Gerhard Geiger, University of Applied Sciences Gelsenkirchen, Faculty of Electrical Engineering applications are therefore limited to special high- risk areas, e.g. near rivers or nature-protection areas.  Analytic thermal leak detector for above ground pipelines  Video analytics driven thermal imaging using uncooled microbolometer infrared sensors is emerging as a new and effective method of visualizing, detecting and generating alerts of unplanned surface emissions of liquids and hydrocarbon gas liquids. Detection to alarm generation takes less than 30 seconds. This technology is suitable for above-ground piping facilities, such as pump stations, refineries, storage sites, mines, chemical plants, water crossings, and water treatment plants. The need for new solutions in this area is driven by the fact that more than half of pipeline leaks occur at facilities. High quality thermographic technology accurately measures and visualizes emissivity or infrared radiation (thermal heat) of objects into gray scale imagery without the need for ambient lighting. The monitored petroleum product (e.g. oil) is distinguished from background objects by this heat difference. The addition of an analytic software component, typically optimizable to better address a specific application or environment, enables automated onsite leak analysis, validation and reporting, thereby reducing reliance on man power. A leak appearing within an analytic region (a rule added to the camera) is immediately analyzed for its attributes, including thermal temperature, size, and behaviour (e.g. spraying, pooling, spilling). When a leak is determined to be valid based on set parameters, an alarm notification with leak video is generated and sent to a monitoring station. Optimal detection distance varies and is influenced by camera lens size, resolution, field of view, thermal detection range and sensitivity, leak size, and other factors. The system's layers of filters and immunity to environmental elements, such as snow, ice, rain, fog and glare, contribute to false alarms reduction. The video monitoring architecture can be integrated onto existing leak detection and repair (LDAR) systems, including SCADA networks, as well as other surveillance systems.  Digital oil leak detection cable  Digital sense cables consist of a braid of semi-permeable internal conductors protected by a permeable insulating moulded braid. An electrical signal is passed through the internal conductors and is monitored by an inbuilt microprocessor inside the cable connector. Escaping fluids pass through the external permeable braid and make contact with the internal semi- permeable conductors. This causes a change in the electrical properties of the cable that is detected by the microprocessor. The microprocessor can locate the fluid to within a 1-metre resolution along its length and provide an appropriate signal to monitoring systems or operators. The sense cables can be wrapped around pipelines, buried sub-surface with pipelines or installed as a pipe-in-pipe configuration.TTK S.A.S. Liquid Hydrocarbon and Non-Conductive Solvent Sense Cable http://www.ttkuk.com/oil-leak-detection/products/sense- cable/hydrocarbon-sense-cables/fg-od/  Infrared radiometric pipeline testing  Aerial thermogram of buried cross country oil pipeline revealing subsurface contamination caused by a leak. Infrared thermographic pipeline testing has shown itself to be both accurate and efficient in detecting and locating subsurface pipeline leaks, voids caused by erosion, deteriorated pipeline insulation, and poor backfill. When a pipeline leak has allowed a fluid, such as water, to form a plume near a pipeline, the fluid has a thermal conductance different from the dry soil or backfill. This will be reflected in different surface temperature patterns above the leak location. A high- resolution infrared radiometer allows entire areas to be scanned and the resulting data to be displayed as pictures with areas of differing temperatures designated by differing grey tones on a black & white image or by various colours on a colour image. This system measures surface energy patterns only, but the patterns that are measured on the surface of the ground above a buried pipeline can help show where pipeline leaks and resulting erosion voids are forming; it detects problems as deep as 30 meters below the ground surface.Jackson, C.N.; Sherlock, C.N. (1998): Non-destructive Testing Handbook: Leak Testing, page 519, Library of Congress Cataloging-in- Publication Data, 2008.  Acoustic emission detectors  Chris Cassidy works with an ultrasonic leak detector on the International Space Station. Escaping liquids create an acoustic signal as they pass through a hole in the pipe. Acoustic sensors affixed to the outside of the pipeline create a baseline acoustic \\"fingerprint\\" of the line from the internal noise of the pipeline in its undamaged state. When a leak occurs, a resulting low frequency acoustic signal is detected and analysed. Deviations from the baseline \\"fingerprint\\" signal an alarm.Fuchs, H. V. (1991): Ten Year of Experience with Leak Detection by Acoustic Signal Analysis. Applied Acoustics 33 (1991), p. 1-19. Now sensors are having better arrangement with frequency band selection, time delay range selection etc. This makes the graphs more distinct and easy to analyse. There are other ways to detect leakage. Ground geo-phones with filter arrangement are very useful to pinpoint the leakage location. It saves the excavation cost. The water jet in the soil hits the inner wall of soil or concrete. This will create a feeble noise. This noise will decay while coming up on the surface. But the maximum sound can be picked up only over the leakage position. Amplifiers and filter helps to get clear noise. Some types of gases entered into the pipe line will create a range of sounds when leaving the pipe.  Vapour-sensing tubes  The vapour-sensing tube leak detection method involves the installation of a tube along the entire length of the pipeline. This tube - in cable form - is highly permeable to the substances to be detected in the particular application. If a leak occurs, the substances to be measured come into contact with the tube in the form of vapour, gas or dissolved in water. In the event of a leak, some of the leaking substance diffuses into the tube. After a certain period of time, the inside of the tube produces an accurate image of the substances surrounding the tube. In order to analyse the concentration distribution present in the sensor tube, a pump pushes the column of air in the tube past a detection unit at a constant speed. The detector unit at the end of the sensor tube is equipped with gas sensors. Every increase in gas concentration results in a pronounced \\"leak peak\\".Leakage detection and localization system - LEOSTechnical Review of Leak Detection Technologies - Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation  Fibre-optic leak detection  At least two fibre-optic leak detection methods are being commercialized: Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) and Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS). The DTS method involves the installation of a fibre-optic cable along the length of pipeline being monitored. The substances to be measured come into contact with the cable when a leak occurs, changing the temperature of the cable and changing the reflection of the laser beam pulse, signalling a leak. The location is known by measuring the time delay between when the laser pulse was emitted and when the reflection is detected. This only works if the substance is at a temperature different from the ambient environment. In addition, the distributed fibre-optical temperature-sensing technique offers the possibility to measure temperature along the pipeline. Scanning the entire length of the fibre, the temperature profile along the fibre is determined, leading to leak detection.Gro√üwig, S. et al. (2001): Distributed Fiber Optical Temperature Sensing Technique ‚Äì A Variable Tool for Monitoring Tasks. Proceedings of the 8th International Symposium on Temperature and Thermal Measurements in Industry and Science, June 19 ‚Äì 21, 2001. The DAS method involves a similar installation of fiber- optic cable along the length of pipeline being monitored. Vibrations caused by a substance leaving the pipeline via a leak changes the reflection of the laser beam pulse, signaling a leak. The location is known by measuring the time delay between when the laser pulse was emitted and when the reflection is detected. This technique can also be combined with the Distributed Temperature Sensing method to provide a temperature profile of the pipeline.  Pipeline flyovers  Flyovers of the pipeline are frequently carried out to either confirm the location or to detect and locate small releases that cannot be identified by other methods. Typically the flyover of the right of way is recorded by video, which may have some image filtering, such as thermal imaging. Larger spills will typically be identified by a \\"sheen\\" in wetland or an area of dead vegetation around the release location. Flyovers are typically scheduled and not recommended as a primary leak-detection method. They may be used to rapidly confirm the presence and location of a leak. Biological leak detection  Biological methods of leak detection includes the use of dogs, which are more likely to be used once a release has been identified but not located due to its small size; or by landscapers who keep the pipeline right of way clear. There are several companies who can provide dogs trained to identify the scent of release. Typically a technician injects a fluid into the pipeline that the scent dogs are trained to track. The dogs will then direct handlers towards a pipeline leak. They are trained to indicated at the strongest concentration therefore their pinpointing abilities can be typically within a meter. It typically takes 24 to 48 hours to mobilise a team, and may take several days to actually locate a release depending on the remoteness of the area. Pipeline rights of way are kept clear by landscapers who are also trained to look for signs of pipeline releases. This is typically a scheduled process and should not be considered a primary form of leak detection.

Until 2003, the name of the organization was the Marine Prediction Center.Ocean Prediction Center (2004). Ocean Prediction Center: 2003 Accomplishments. Retrieved on 2008-09-03. Its origins are traced back to the sinking of the RMS Titanic in 1912. The OPC issues forecasts up to five days in advance for ocean areas north of 31¬∞ north latitude and west of 35¬∞ west longitude in the Atlantic, and across the northeast Pacific north of 30¬∞ north latitude and east of 160¬∞ east longitude. Until recently, the OPC provided forecast points for tropical cyclones north of 20¬∞ north latitude and east of the 60¬∞ west longitude to the National Hurricane Center. OPC is composed of two branches: the Ocean Forecast Branch and the Ocean Applications Branch. History The first attempt as a marine weather program within the United States was initiated in New Orleans, Louisiana, by the United States Army Signal Corps. A January 23, 1873, memo directed the New Orleans Signal Observer to transcribe meteorological data from the ship logs of those arriving in port. Marine forecasting responsibility transferred from the United States Navy to the Weather Bureau in 1904, which enabled the receipt of timely observations from ships at sea. The basis for OPC's mission can be traced back to the sinking of the Titanic in April 1912. In response to that tragedy, an international commission was formed to determine requirements for safer ocean voyages. In 1914, the commission's work resulted in the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, of which the United States is one of the original signatories. In 1957, in order to help address marine issues, the United States Weather Bureau started to publish the Mariners Weather Log bi-monthly publication to report past weather conditions primarily over Northern Hemisphere oceans, information regarding the globe's tropical cyclone seasons, to publish monthly climatologies for use of those at sea, and to encourage voluntary ship observations from vessels at sea. From 1957 through 1966, the United States Weather Bureau's Office of Climatology published the Log. From 1966 through the summer of 1995, the Environmental Data Service, which became the National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service, published the magazine. Within the United States National Weather Service (NWS), forecast weather maps began to be published by offices in New York City, San Francisco, and Honolulu for public use. North Atlantic forecasts were shifted from a closed United States Navy endeavor to a National Weather Service product suite via radiofacsimile in 1971, while northeast Pacific forecasts became publicly available by the same method in 1972. Between 1986 and 1989, the portion of the National Meteorological Center (NMC) known as the Ocean Products Center (OPC) was responsible for marine weather forecasting guidance within the NWS. Between August 1989 and 1995, the unit named the Marine Forecast Branch also was involved in providing objective analysis and forecast products for marine and oceanographic variables. When the National Centers for Environmental Prediction was created, the Marine Prediction Center (MPC) was organized to assume the U.S. obligation to issue warnings and forecasts for portions of the North Atlantic and North Pacific oceans. MPC was expected to be moved from Camp Springs, Maryland, to Monterey, California, but this did not occur. The Center was renamed the Ocean Prediction Center (OPC) on January 12, 2003. Products The National Weather Service areas of marine weather forecasting responsibility Wave height analysis from OPC OPC's Ocean Forecast Branch issues warnings and forecasts in print and graphical formats for up five days into the future. Over 100 forecast products are issued daily. They cover the North Atlantic Ocean from the west coast of Europe to the U.S. and Canadian east coasts, and the North Pacific Ocean from the U.S. and Canadian west coast to the east coast of Asia. OPC weather forecasts and warnings for these areas primarily ensure the safety of ocean-crossing commercial ships and other vessels on the high seas. Embedded in these high seas areas are smaller offshore zones off the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. These zones extend from near the coast seaward to just beyond the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zones, out to about . OPC services ensure the safety of the extensive commercial and recreational fishing, boating, and shipping activities in these offshore waters. OPC began to produce experimental gridded significant wave height forecasts in 2006, a first step toward digital marine service for high seas and offshore areas. Additional gridded products such as surface pressure and winds are under development. Recently, OPC began to use the NWS operational extratropical storm surge model output to provide experimental extratropical storm surge guidance for coastal weather forecast offices to assist them in coastal flood warning and forecast operations. Role in the unified surface analysis The OPC provides an important role in the production of the National Weather Service Unified Surface Analysis. After the Weather Prediction Center, or WPC, sends out their analysis for the synoptic hour, OPC cuts and stitches the WPC analysis to its area. The National Hurricane Center, or NHC, stitches the analysis from the Honolulu Forecast Office onto their map, before it is sent up to OPC. The OPC analysts then stitch together the entire analysis, and send it to the world through their website. The analysis covers much of the Northern Hemisphere, except for eastern Europe and the western half of Asia. Quality control of marine observations In 1994, OPC began to quality control global surface marine observations. Using an automated algorithm and interactive system, forecasters examine the latest observations from voluntary observing ships and drifting and moored platforms and compare them against short-projection model runs. Worldwide surface marine observations come to OPC via the World Meteorological Organization's Global Telecommunications System in real time. These quality control measures remove spurious data before the data are ingested into models to initialize forecasts. Several hundred of these observations are interactively examined daily. In addition, the quality controlled data are used by OPC forecasters to determine if gale, storm, or hurricane-force wind warnings are warranted. Ocean Applications Branch The Ocean Applications Branch plays an important role in enhancing OPC operations and services. One example is the adaptation of ocean surface winds observed from the QuikSCAT satellite in early 2000. Prior to the QuikSCAT launch, there was no ability to observe, verify, and warn of hurricane-force wind conditions, areas where wind speed exceeds , often associated with strong winter ocean storms. With QuikSCAT data routinely available in 2000, OPC began to issue hurricane-force wind warnings. In the 2006-2007 winter storm season, over 100 hurricane-force wind warnings were issued for North Pacific and North Atlantic oceans to warn ships of these most severe weather hazard conditions over major shipping routes. Preliminary results from a recent study estimates that in the absence of good information about extra-tropical ocean storms, the annual loss to container and dry bulk shipping would be on the order of more than $500 million. Operational marine warnings and forecasts reduce the above estimated annual loss by nearly one half. OPC has a number of ongoing research-to-operations transition efforts that will lead to a suite of new oceanographic analysis and forecast products, such as ocean temperatures and currents based on real time observations and advanced global and basin scale ocean forecasting models. Global ocean sea surface temperatures and currents are now available on the OPC website.

As a result of his work in the Admiralty's OIC, RCN researchers contacted him after the close of the war to gain information about the project. In 1982, in a letter to Vice Admiral Sir Peter Gretton, McDiarmid described the procedures of the until then top secret Admiralty Tracking room. \\"In the tracking room all signals containing or referring to Special Intelligence were decoded or encoded. No special intelligence ever left the room except to be burned and flushed down the head by an officer of the room; and no chart outside of the room showed more Special Intelligence than was revealed by our daily Secret and Top Secret signals. Admission to the room was severely restricted to those who had a need to know ‚Ä¶\\" McDiarmid retired at the end World War II with the rank of Commander, RCVN. University of Washington McDiarmid returned to Johns Hopkins to a teaching position in the Classics Department, where he served from 1945‚Äì1949. In 1949, he accepted the position as the first chairman in the Classics Department at the University of Washington, in Seattle. He remained chairman of the Department until 1973. He was instrumental in the rapid growth of the department and in reorganizing its curriculum. He played a key role in the formation of the Classics Department graduate program. He was the first University of Washington Professor of Humanities in 1977‚Äì1978.Bliquez 2002, 2. He and provost Solomon Katz founded the Seattle chapter of the Archaeological Institute of America. Achievements and awards McDiarmid's other honors and achievements include membership in the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, NJ, 1952‚Äì1953 (at same time as Albert Einstein) and 1957‚Äì1958, under the directorship of atomic-bomb physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer; and Guggenheim Fellow, 1957‚Äì1958. He was a founding member of the Intercollegiate Center for Classical Studies in Rome. As a scholar and an authority on ancient Greece, he wrote and published many articles on its literature and philosophers and was a popular lecturer on these subjects. The University of Washington's Classics Department lecture series, in which graduate students select the speakers, is called the John and Mary McDiarmid Lectureship. His wife, Mary Kahn McDiarmid, former president of Northwest Sculptors and president of Northwest Bonsai Society, died in 1988. His study on Theophrastus was reviewed and improved by two renowned scholars Harold F. Cherniss and Eric A. Havelock (p. 133). Cherniss makes the strong suggestion that \\"further investigation must be made of the relationship of Theophrastus to Aristotle (p.87)\\". Several translations of Theophrastus by Fortenbaugh and others have appeared since McDiarmid's article. Havelock would go on to challenge the traditional views of Platonism which Cherniss maintained. Havelock wrote in his later works on Greek philosophy that he found Aristotle more reliable than Cherniss let on and the successive accounts by doxographers that McDiarmid states \\"each doxographer raises individual problems in addition to those that are due to the common dependence on Theophrastus' work\\" (ibid). It remains a valuable mid-century source and textual apparatus for present day scholarship in the field of Ancient philosophy, reprinted in 1970, and was cited as a source for understanding PreSocratic philosophers recently on the subject of rewriting the history of Ancient Greek philosophy. His study is also noted as raising the sceptical view regarding Theophrastus and Aristotle as reliable sources for the PreSocratics.

It also features William Hartnell, Gerald Sim, Thorley Walters, Victor Maddern and John Le Mesurier in supporting roles. Plot Josephine's (Glynis Johns) story is told in flashback by her suave bachelor uncle (Jack Buchanan). We hear how she rejects her wealthy fianc√© Alan (Donald Sinden)(who owns a Bristol 405 car) for his friend David (Peter Finch), an unsuccessful playwright. But when their situations are reversed, Josephine's interest in David starts to wane. She is a woman we hear, always drawn to underdogs. Mr Charles Luton (Jack Buchanan) is living in a hotel and on good terms with the receptionist and barman. He tells them of his problem with women. He then starts explaining his niece, Josephine... he describes her moral campaigning as being a \\"one-woman Salvation Army\\". Josephine introduces her fiancee, Alan Hartley (Donald Sinden), to the uncle over dinner. All three go to visit \\"whats-his-name\\" (Peter Finch) in a run down tenement. He lives on the top floor and a half-dressed Italian girl storms off as they arrive. \\"Whats-his-name\\", David Hewer, an unemployed playwright, is living in squalor. Josephine offers to wash the big pile of dishes. His attic flat has a rooftop view over other houses to two gasometers in the mid-distance... which although seen as a romantic view would then be seen as undesirable. Josephine leaves her gloves so she has an excuse to return alone. She tidies a bit and leaves, almost forgetting her gloves. They shake hands. Back at Josephine's parents house, Alan, Josephine and her parents inspect the wedding presents. The parents look down upon the electroplated silver tray, as an inferior gift. However, Josephine tells Alan she wants to break off the engagement and marry David Hewer... but he does not know yet. Josephine makes it clear that she must marry the person who needs her most i.e. the underdog. David and Josephine marry at a registry office on Friday the 13th April. The Italian girl and the Bohemian living in David's tenement act as witnesses. Alan forgives them both and sends a silver Georgian teapot as a wedding gift. David writes two successful comedies: \\"Love on a Crust\\" and \\"Hard Cheese\\". Meanwhile Alan concentrates on his professional life and becomes hugely successful. Joe and David move to a remote country cottage. Uncle Charlie comes to visit (with quite a lot of luggage). The police arrive at Alan Hartley's house looking to arrest him for obtaining money by deception. Although this does not appear to be his own fault, he flees. He runs to David and Joe arriving in heavy rain having walked 15 miles. Alan is invited to stay but David starts to become paranoid that he will be discovered there and they might all be arrested. Joe starts to gravitate towards Alan as his \\"need\\" is greater. The police arrive at the cottage and ask questions about Hartley. Uncle Charlie and David answer all questions truthfully but in a tactful way to avoid giving any useful information. Uncle Charles says he saw Alan \\"recently\\" .... at his club two years ago. Alan discusses his plan to escape to South America with Joe. Uncle Charles returns to find Joe and Alan kissing in the cottage. David gets fed up with it all and goes to the pub. Uncle Charles joins him later, but David rushes off after making a phone call. Joe and Alan are stopped by police while driving. He gives himself up and at the station discovers that his partner left a note taking full blame. Joe instantly realises she is not needed by him and she must return to David.

He also amassed a total of 35 caps for the Northern Ireland national football team. Following his playing career, he went into management, taking charge of various clubs in both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Jackson began his professional football career playing for Glentoran. He became a regular in the Glentoran side by the age of 21, and won league- winners' medals in 1967 and 1968 before signing for Everton in February 1968. In just over two seasons with the Toffees, Jackson picked up yet another league-winners' medal in 1970. His performances as understudy to the likes of Alan Ball and Howard Kendall attracted the attention of other clubs and, after just 32 league appearances for Everton, Jackson was signed by Nottingham Forest in October 1970. Forest were struggling for survival in the First Division, but Jackson still only managed to make 81 appearances, albeit scoring six goals. The arrival of Brian Clough and the emergence of Martin O'Neill saw Jackson's opportunities become even fewer and further between, and he was granted a free transfer in the summer of 1975. He was then signed by Manchester United manager Tommy Docherty with the intention of Jackson captaining the club's reserve team and instilling a level of professionalism in the club, which had just been promoted back into the First Division. However, Jackson made such a good impression that he was rewarded with 17 league starts that season, helping the team to an impressive third-place finish. Nevertheless, he spent the 1976‚Äì77 season back in his intended reserve team role before retiring back to Ireland to become the player-manager at Waterford United. There, he led the club to two consecutive FAI Cup finals, winning the competition in 1980. Despite the FAI Cup win, one trophy in four years was not enough for the Waterford United board, and Jackson was sacked in 1982. It was a whole year before he got another management job, returning to Northern Ireland as manager of Crusaders in July 1983. The team won the Gold Cup in 1985, beating Linfield 2‚Äì1 in the final, but Jackson left the club in October of the following season, before returning to his first club, Glentoran, three months later. In 6¬Ω years at Glentoran, Jackson led the team to 16 major trophies, including the Double in 1988, but the team's form began to dip after their title win in 1992, and Jackson was sacked in July 1993.

It is a core part of Cartographic design. Whether done manually by a cartographer or by a computer or set of algorithms, generalization seeks to abstract spatial information at a high level of detail to information that can be rendered on a map at a lower level of detail. For example, we might have the outlines of all of the thousands of buildings in a region, but we wish to make a map of the whole city no more than a few inches wide. Instead of throwing out the building information, or trying to render it all at once, we could generalize the data into some sort of outline of the urbanized area of the region. The cartographer has license to adjust the content within their maps to create a suitable and useful map that conveys spatial information, while striking the right balance between the map's purpose and the precise detail of the subject being mapped. Well generalized maps are those that emphasize the most important map elements while still representing the world in the most faithful and recognizable way. History During the first half of the 20th Century, cartographers began to think seriously about how the features they drew depended on scale. Eduard Imhof, one of the most accomplished academic and professional cartographers at the time, published a study of city plans on maps at a variety of scales in 1937, itemizing several forms of generalization that occurred, including those later termed symbolization, merging, simplification, enhancement, and displacement. As analytical approaches to geography arose in the 1950s and 1960s, generalization, especially line simplification and raster smoothing, was a target of study.Perkal, Julian (1958) \\"Proba obiektywnej generalizacji,\\" Geodezja i Karografia, VII:2 (1958), pp.130-142. English translation, 1965, \\"An Attempt at Objective Generalization,\\" Discussion Papers of The Michigan Inter-university Community of Mathematical Geographers Generalization was probably the most thoroughly studied aspect of cartography from the 1970s to the 1990s. This is probably because it fit within both of the major two research trends of the era: cartographic communication (especially signal processing algorithms based on Information theory), and the opportunities afforded by technological advance (because of its potential for automation). Early research focused primarily on algorithms for automating individual generalization operations. By the late 1980s, academic cartographers were thinking bigger, developing a general theory of generalization, and exploring the use of expert systems and other nascent Artificial intelligence technologies to automate the entire process, including decisions on which tools to use when. These tracks foundered somewhat in the late 1990s, coinciding with a general loss of faith in the promise of AI, and the rise of post-modern criticisms of the impacts of the automation of design. In recent years, the generalization community has seen a resurgence, fueled in part by the renewed opportunities of AI. Another recent trend has been a focus on multi-scale mapping, integrating GIS databases developed for several target scales, narrowing the scope of need for generalization to the scale \\"gaps\\" between them, a more manageable level for automation. Theories of Map detail Generalization is often defined simply as removing detail, but it is based on the notion, originally adopted from Information theory, of the volume of information or detail found on the map, and how that volume is controlled by map scale, map purpose, and intended audience. If there is an optimal amount of information for a given map project, then generalization is the process of taking existing available data, often called (especially in Europe) the digital landscape model (DLM), which usually but not always has a larger amount of information than needed, and processing it to create a new data set, often called the digital cartographic model (DCM), with the desired amount. Many general conceptual models have been proposed for understanding this process, often attempting to capture the decision process of the human master cartographer. One of the most popular models, developed by McMaster and Shea in 1988, divides these decisions into three phases: Philosophical objectives, the general reasons why generalization is desirable or necessary, and criteria for evaluating its success; Cartometric evaluation, the characteristics of a given map (or feature within that map) that demands generalization; and Spatial and attribute transformations, the set of generalization operators available to use on a given feature, layer, or map. In the first, most conceptual phase, McMaster and Shea show how generalization plays a central role in resolving the often conflicting goals of Cartographic design as a whole: functionality vs. aesthetics, information richness vs. clarity, and the desire to do more vs. the limitations of technology and medium. These conflicts can be reduced to a basic conflict between the need for more data on the map, and the need for less, with generalization as the tool for balancing them. One challenge with the information theory approach to generalization is its basis on measuring the amount of information on the map, before and after generalization procedures. One could conceive of a map being quantified by its map information density, the average number of \\"bits\\" of information per unit area on the map (or its corollary, information resolution, the average distance between bits), and by its ground information density or resolution, the same measures per unit area on the Earth. Scale would thus be proportional to the ratio between them, and a change in scale would require the adjustment of one or both of them by means of generalization. But what counts as a \\"bit\\" of map information? In specific cases, that is not difficult, such as counting the total number of features on the map, or the number of vertices in a single line (possibly reduced to the number of salient vertices); such straightforwardness explains why these were early targets for generalization research. However, it is a challenge for the map in general, in which questions arise such as \\"how much graphical information is there in a map label: one bit (the entire word), a bit for each character, or bits for each vertex or curve in every character, as if they were each area features?\\" Each option can be relevant at different times. This measurement is further complicated by the role of map symbology, which can affect the apparent information density. A map with a strong visual hierarchy (i.e., with less important layers being subdued but still present) carries an aesthetic of being \\"clear\\" because it appears at first glance to contain less data than it really does; conversely, a map with no visual hierarchy, in which all layers seem equally important, might be summarized as \\"cluttered\\" because one's first impression is that it contains more data than it really does. Designing a map to achieve the desired gestalt aesthetic is therefore about managing the apparent information density more than the actual information density. In the words of Edward Tufte, There is recent work that recognizes the role of map symbols, including the Roth-Brewer typology of generalization operators, although they clarify that symbology is not a form of generalization, just a partner with generalization in achieving a desired apparent information density. Operators There are many cartographic techniques that are used to adjust the amount of geographic data on the map. Over the decades of generalization research, over a dozen unique lists of such generalization operators have been published, with significant differences. In fact, there are multiple reviews comparing the lists, and even they miss a few salient ones, such as that found in John Keates' first textbook (1973) that was apparently ahead of its time. Some of these operations have been automated by multiple algorithms, with tools available in Geographic information systems and other software; others have proven much more difficult, with most cartographers still performing them manually. This OpenStreetMap map of Oklahoma shows the challenges of automated Selection from raw GIS data. The gaps in the highways are not due to missing data, but to shortcomings in the selection process. Note also that the point and label for Oklahoma City is missing, although its suburbs Norman and Edmond are included. Select Also called filter, omission One of the first operators to be recognized and analyzed, first appearing in the 1973 Keates list, selection is the process of simply removing entire geographic features from the map. There are two types of selection, which are combined in some models, and separated in others: * Layer Selection: (also called class selection or add) the choice of which data layers or themes to include or not (for example, a street map including streets but not geology). * Feature Selection: (sometimes called refinement or eliminate) the choice of which specific features to include or remove within an included layers (for example, which 50 of the millions of cities to show on a world map). In feature selection, the choice of which features to keep or exclude is more challenging than it might seem. Using a simple attribute of real-world size (city population, road width or traffic volume, river flow volume), while often easily available in existing GIS data, often produces a selection that is excessively concentrated in some areas and sparse in others. Thus, cartographers often filter them using their degree of regional importance, their prominence in their local area rather than the map as a whole, which produces a more balanced map, but is more difficult to automate. Many formulas have been developed for automatically ranking the regional importance of features, for example by balancing the raw size with the distance to the nearest feature of significantly greater size, similar to measures of Topographic prominence, but this is much more difficult for line features than points, and sometimes produces undesirable results (such as the \\"Baltimore Problem,\\" in which cities that seem important get left out). Another approach is to manually encode a subjective judgment of regional importance into the GIS data, which can subsequently be used to filter features; this was the approach taken for the Natural Earth dataset created by cartographers. Simplify Comparison of several common line generalization algorithms. Gray: original line (394 vertices), orange: 1973 Douglas-Peucker simplification (11 vertices), blue: 2002 PAEK smoothing (483 vertices), red: 2004 Zhou-Jones simplification (31 vertices). All were run with the same tolerance parameters. Another early focus of generalization research, simplification is the removal of vertices in lines and area boundaries. A variety of algorithms have been developed, but most involve searching through the vertices of the line, removing those that contribute the least to the overall shape of the line. The Ramer‚ÄìDouglas‚ÄìPeucker algorithm (1972/1973) is one of the earliest and still most common techniques for line simplification. Most of these algorithms, especially the early ones, placed a higher priority on reducing the size of datasets in the days of limited digital storage, than on quality appearance on maps, and often produce lines that look excessively angular, especially on curves such as rivers. 1:24,000 and 1:100,000 (inset) geological maps of the same area in Zion National Park, Utah. Deriving the smaller from the larger would require several generalization operations, including selection to eliminate less important features (e.g., minor faults), smoothing of area boundaries, classification of similar formations into broader categories (e.g., Qmsc + Qmsy > Qms), merging of small areas into dissimilar but larger ones (e.g., Qmt), exaggeration of very narrow areas (Jms/Jks), and displacement of areas adjacent to exaggerated areas. Actually, both maps were compiled independently. Smooth For line features (and area boundaries), Smoothing seems similar to simplification, and in the past, was sometimes combined with simplification. The difference is that smoothing is designed to make the overall shape of the line look simpler by removing small details; which may actually require more vertices than the original. Simplification tends to make a curved line look angular, while Smoothing tends to do the opposite. The smoothing principle is also often used to generalize raster representations of fields, often using a Kernel smoother approach. This was actually one of the first published generalization algorithms, by Waldo Tobler in 1966. Merge Also called dissolve, amalgamation, agglomeration, or combine This operation, identified by Imhof in 1937, involves combining neighboring features into a single feature of the same type, at scales where the distinction between them is not important. For example, a mountain chain may consist of several isolated ridges in the natural environment, but shown as a continuous chain on a small scale the map. Or, adjacent buildings in a complex could be combined into a single \\"building.\\" For proper interpretation, the map reader must be aware that because of scale limitations combined elements are not perfect depictions of natural or manmade features. Dissolve is a common GIS tool that is used for this generalization operation, but additional tools GIS tools have been developed for specific situations, such as finding very small polygons and merging them into neighboring larger polygons. This operator is different from aggregation because there is no change in dimensionality (i.e. lines are dissolved into lines and polygons into polygons), and the original and final objects are of the same conceptual type (e.g., building becomes building). Aggregate Also called combine or regionalization Aggregation is the merger of multiple features into a new composite feature, often of increased Dimension (usually points to areas). The new feature is of an ontological type different than the original individuals, because it conceptualizes the group. For example, a multitude of \\"buildings\\" can be turned into a single region representing an \\"urban area\\" (not a \\"building\\"), or a cluster of \\"trees\\" into a \\"forest\\". Some GIS software has aggregation tools that identify clusters of features and combine them. Aggregation differs from Merging in that it can operate across dimensions, such as aggregating points to lines, points to polygons, lines to polygons, and polygons to polygons, and that there is a conceptual difference between the source and product.  Typify  Also called distribution refinement Typify is a symbology operator that replaces a large set of similar features with a smaller number of representative symbols, resulting in a sparser, cleaner map. For example, an area with dozens of mines might be symbolized with only 3 or 4 mine symbols that do not represent actual mine locations, just the general presence of mines in the area. Unlike the aggregation operator which replaces many related features with a single \\"group\\" feature, the symbols used in the typify operator still represent individuals, just \\"typical\\" individuals. It reduces the density of features while still maintaining its relative location and design. When using the typify operator, a new set of symbols is created, it does not change the spatial data. This operator can be used on point, line, and polygon features. Collapse Also called Symbolize This operator reduces the Dimension of a feature, such as the common practice of representing cities (2-dimensional) as points (0-dimensional), and roads (2-dimensional) as lines (1-dimensional). Frequently, a Map symbol is applied to the resultant geometry to give a general indication of its original extent, such as point diameter to represent city population or line thickness to represent the number of lanes in a road. Imhof (1937) discusses these particular generalizations at length. This operator frequently mimics a similar cognitive generalization practice. For example, unambiguously discussing the distance between two cities implies a point conceptualization of a city, and using phrases like \\"up the road\\" or \\"along the road\\" or even street addresses implies a line conceptualization of a road. Reclassify This operator primarily simplifies the attributes of the features, although a geometric simplification may also result. While Categorization is used for a wide variety of purposes, in this case the task is to take a large range of values that is too complex to represent on the map of a given scale, and reduce it to a few categories that is much simpler to represent, especially if geographic patterns result in large regions of the same category. An example would be to take a land cover layer with 120 categories, and group them into 5 categories (urban, agriculture, forest, water, desert), which would make a spatially simpler map. For discrete fields (also known as categorical coverages or area-class maps) represented as vector polygons, such as land cover, climate type, soil type, city zoning, or surface geology, reclassification often results in adjacent polygons with the same category, necessitating a subsequent dissolve operation to merge them. Exaggerate In this OpenStreetMap map of Loveland Pass, Colorado, symbol exaggeration of the thickness of the roads has made them run together. Geometric exaggeration of the hairpin turns and displacement of the roads alongside the interstate are needed to clarify the road network. Exaggeration is the partial adjustment of geometry or symbology to make some aspect of a feature larger than it really is, in order to make them more visible, recognizable, or higher in the visual hierarchy. For example, a set of tight switchbacks in a road would run together on a small-scale map, so the road is redrawn with the loops larger and further apart than in reality. A symbology example would be drawing highways as thick lines in a small-scale map that would be miles wide if measured according to the scale. Exaggeration often necessitates a subsequent displacement operation because the exaggerated feature overlaps the actual location of nearby features, necessitating their adjustment. Displace Also called conflict resolution Displacement can be employed when two objects are so close to each other that they would overlap at smaller scales, especially when an exaggerate operator has made the two objects larger than they really are. A common place where this would occur is the cities Brazzaville and Kinshasa on either side of the Congo river in Africa. They are both the capital city of their country and on overview maps they would be displayed with a slightly larger symbol than other cities. Depending on the scale of the map the symbols would overlap. By displacing both of them away from the river (and away from their true location) the symbol overlap can be avoided. Another common case is when a road and a railroad run parallel to each other. Keates (1973) was one of the first to use the modern terms for exaggeration and displacement and discuss their close relationship, but they were recognized as early as Imhof (1937) Enhance This is the addition of symbols or other details on a smaller scale map to make a particular feature make more sense, especially when such understanding is important the map purpose. A common example is the addition of a bridge symbol to emphasize that a road crossing is not at grade, but an overpass. At a large scale, such a symbol may not be necessary because of the different symbology and the increased space to show the actual relationship. This addition may seem counter-intuitive if one only thinks of generalization as the removal of detail. This is one of the least commonly listed operators. GIS and automated generalization As GIS developed from about the late 1960s onward, the need for automatic, algorithmic generalization techniques became clear. Ideally, agencies responsible for collecting and maintaining spatial data should try to keep only one canonical representation of a given feature, at the highest possible level of detail. That way there is only one record to update when that feature changes in the real world. From this large- scale data, it should ideally be possible, through automated generalization, to produce maps and other data products at any scale required. The alternative is to maintain separate databases each at the scale required for a given set of mapping projects, each of which requires attention when something changes in the real world. Several broad approaches to generalization were developed around this time: * The representation-oriented view focuses on the representation of data on different scales, which is related to the field of Multi-Representation Databases (MRDB). * The process-oriented view focuses on the process of generalization. * The ladder-approach is a stepwise generalization, in which each derived dataset is based on the other database of the next larger scale. * The star-approach is the derived data on all scales is based on a single (large-scale) data base. Scaling law There are far more small geographic features than large ones in the Earth's surface, or far more small things than large ones in maps. This notion of far more small things than large ones is also called spatial heterogeneity, which has been formulated as scaling law. Cartographic generalization or any mapping practices in general is essentially to retain the underlying scaling of numerous smallest, a very few largest, and some in between the smallest and largest. This mapping process can be efficiently and effectively achieved by head/tail breaks, a new classification scheme or visualization tool for data with a heavy tailed distribution. Scaling law is likely to replace T√∂pfer's radical law to be a universal law for various mapping practices. What underlies scaling law is something of paradigm shift from Euclidean geometry to fractal, from non-recursive thinking to recursive thinking. The 'Baltimore phenomenon' The Baltimore phenomenon is the tendency for a city (or other object) to be omitted from maps due to space constraints while smaller cities are included on the same map simply because space is available to display them. This phenomenon owes its name to the city of Baltimore, Maryland, which tends to be omitted on maps due to the presence of larger cities in close proximity within the Mid-Atlantic United States. As larger cities near Baltimore appear on maps, smaller and lesser known cities may also appear at the same scale simply because there is enough space for them on the map. Although the Baltimore phenomenon occurs more frequently on automated mapping sites, it does not occur at every scale. Popular mapping sites like Google Maps, Bing Maps, OpenStreetMap, and Yahoo Maps will only begin displaying Baltimore at certain zoom levels: 5th, 6th, 7th, etc. See also *Cartographic censorship References  Further reading  * Buttenfield, B.

It stars John Gregson, Donald Sinden, Peggy Cummins and Nadia Gray, and featured Maurice Denham, Joan Sims, John Le Mesurier, Richard Wattis and Reginald Beckwith in leading supporting roles. Plot After serving all his working life with the South Star line, exclusively in cargo ships, Captain Albert Ebbs meets his employer (John le Mesurier) and is finally given command (albeit temporarily) of the SS Queen Adelaide, a cruise liner sailing from London to Sydney. An excellent seaman, he finds that he now has many social obligations that he does not have the skills to fulfil. He must preside at the captain's table, host cocktail parties, judge beauty contests and dance with the lady passengers. He must also cope with amorous widows, young couples who want him to marry them and a blustering ex-army major who claims to have the ear of the chairman of the shipping line. To add to his woes, most of the officers and crew, led by the chief purser, are on the fiddle. The captain doesn't fully realise this until the last night of the cruise, when champagne being served is revealed to be cider, with the crew pocketing the considerable profits.

The film co-stars Harry Andrews, Rachel Gurney, and John Le Mesurier and is based on the 1956 novel The Megstone Plot by Paul Winterton, written under the pseudonym Andrew Garve. A Touch of Larceny was nominated for the BAFTA award for Best British Screenplay but it lost out to The Angry Silence. Plot A British World War II naval war hero, Commander Max \\"Rammer\\" Easton (James Mason) now holds a mid-level staff position at the British Admiralty, where he is underemployed, and he spends most of his free time playing squash and pursuing women. While at his private club, he meets Sir Charles Holland (George Sanders) and later Holland's American companion, Virginia Killain (Vera Miles). As soon as Holland goes away for a few days, Max makes a play for Virginia, but she is engaged to be married to Holland and is offended by Max describing him as \\"dull\\" and tells Max she considers him to be a rake. Undaunted, he persists until she agrees to have lunch with him. They later go sailing on Easton's sailboat. Observing that Virginia is impressed by Holland's old school wealth, Max claims that it is easy to acquire money, which she challenges, so on the spot he comes up with an unscrupulous scheme to demonstrate to her just how easy it is. He relates how, after suddenly disappearing under suspicious circumstances, he would leave behind clues and red herrings leading others to jump to the conclusion that he is a traitor, having stolen top secret British Admiralty documents from his division, then defected to the Soviet Union. The scandal would leak and spread through the British press like wildfire. Upon his sudden and surprising return, he would sue the press for libel, raking in thousands of pounds in out-of-court settlements. When she rejects his marriage proposal and says she doesn't want to see him again, Max decides to implement his scheme, sailing away to an out-of-the-way rocky island off the Scottish coast, where he sinks his boat and makes a camp. In due course, he is publicly branded a traitor by the press, all according to his plan. Virginia is at first amused by all this, but then becomes annoyed when she realizes he has actually gone through with it. When she tells Sir Charles, he is outraged and says something must be done. Max's elaborate plan backfires, however, when just as he is about to raise the alarm and get rescued, things go awry and he becomes marooned for real. After eventually being rescued, Max is astonished to learn that he was rescued after a \\"message in a bottle\\" was found on a Scottish beach. Then Sir Charles reveals to authorities everything that Virginia told him about Max's hoax. When confronted, Max's quick thinking frees him from suspicion of any wrong-doing. He then visits Virginia to tell her that, instead of suing the press, he now plans on selling \\"the true story\\" of his survival and rescue to the very same press. When Sir Charles arrives and berates Max, it becomes clear to him that he has lost Virginia to him and he leaves, and Virginia agrees to marry Max.

Longhurst as Club Member Critical reaction In its March 17, 1960 review by A.H. Weiler, The New York Times observed about the film: \\"Mr. MacDougall and his collaborators have devised civilized and, on occasion, mildly funny lines for their cast to speak. The cast, including Harry Andrews, as a strictly Navy captain, and Robert Flemyng, John Le Mesurier and Peter Barkworth, as other officers, pitches in to the proceedings in polished, casual style. These actors, as well as the principals [James Mason, George Sanders, and Vera Miles] make this \\"Touch of Larceny\\" droll, if not devastating\\".

It was serialized in the monthly sh≈çnen manga magazine Champion Red from June 2006 to December 2008. Chapters were collected by Akita Shoten in five tank≈çbon volumes. Cat Paradise is licensed in North America in English by Yen Press, with the first volume released in August 2009. The story follows the career of high school student Yumi Hayakawa and her cat, Kansuke, at Matabi Academy, where they are drawn into an ancient battle between the student council against Kaen, a long-sealed feline demon, and his minions. Synopsis Yumi and her cat, Kansuke had just entered Matabi Academy, a school where students are allowed to have their pet cats live at the dorms. All goes quite well when they are suddenly dragged into a war that had begun long ago to stop Kaen, a great and ancient demon cat. A long time ago, he destroyed the Futakago kingdom, a kingdom that angered Kaen for some unknown reason. Since then, Princess Kiri and her cat, Shirayuki, fought him and sealed him in Futakago's barrier. Many years later, Kaen was finally sealed at Matabi Academy itself, but not before warning to return 100 years later. To prevent this from happening, Princess Kiri and Shirayuki chose a select group of students and their cats and granted them powers that best suit their talents and abilities. These students are Matabi Academy's student council and protect the school. But when Kaen's subordinate, Tsukumoishu, attacked Yumi and Kansuke, the pair was greeted by the Princess and Shirayuki and promised a great power if they chose to fight the threat of Kaen. With no choice, the seventh pair of student and cat make a pact and join this ancient battle. Characters The main protagonists of this manga are the students and cats chosen by Princess Kiri and Shirayuki to help in the battle against Kaen. The antagonists are Kaen and his followers. Protagonists ; : A new student of Matabi Academy that chose to attend the school because she knew she would be allowed to bring her cat, Kansuke. She loves knitting and often makes outfits for Kansuke. Though clumsy and slightly silly, Yumi is also very kind and friendly. Four years ago, she dove onto the road to protect an injured Kansuke from an oncoming van. Her power manifests itself as a ball of wool (mirroring her passion for knitting), which can be used to transform Kansuke into his human form. The wool can also be reshaped into a number of other objects depending on the circumstance, such as a shield or a cushion. One drawback to her power is that it takes time to unravel, and isn't as strong when used in rapid succession. Yumi has a romantic interest in Tsubame, which developed on her first day attending the academy. ; : He is Yumi's cat, a four-year-old, mixed-blood tabby with orange eyes. He sports a large scar on his forehead from when he was hit by Yumi's bike. Yumi came back to see him bleeding on the road and took him in her arms, protecting him from an oncoming van. Kansuke became her pet that day, and swore to protect her from any danger. Due to this, he has a desire to become strong. He is stubborn, strong-willed, competitive and he hates the outfits Yumi makes for him with a passion, tearing some of them up on one occasion. In his transformed state, he resembles an anthropomorphic cat. In combat, he expresses skills in agility and strength, and depending on the outfit knitted for him, he manifests different abilities. ; and : Tsubame is the clerk who Yumi has romantic feelings for. He enjoys reading and is popular with both girls and cats at the school, but notes that he likes girls who are a bit silly and clumsy. His partner is the five-year-old Sakura, a pure-blood she-cat, a sister of Yamato and a descent of Shirayuki. In battle, Sakura turns into a bow that always hits its target and can see at a 360¬∞ angle. ; and : Kamio is the strict and serious president of the third year. He fights alone using his sword to perform powerful attacks. His partner is Yamato, a pure-blood six-year-old white tom. Yamato is Sakura's brother and a descendant of Shirayuki. He has the ability to merge with Kamio's sword, changing its appearance and strengthening its attacks. Shin and Yamato are one of the only two pairs in the series who share the same gender the other being Tsukasa Hinode and Raimu. ; and : Kotori is the vice-president, who has a strong beliefs that problems should be dealt with through talking instead of violence. Kotori's power is the ability to materialize food, which she gives to her partner Musashimaru, a six-year-old Persian mix. The food activates Musashimaru's power, the ability to grow in size. She is the closest to Yumi among the other guardians and often offers friendly advice and assistance. She and Kaiya are childhood friends and it is revealed that she is in love with him but won't say it. ; and : Kaiya is the prefect of class, and his partner is a female Siamese cat named Hisui. Kaiya can produce a material that Hisui can levitate, which Kaiya often uses to surf in the air. Hisui refers to Kaiya as her \\"darling\\" and gets jealous very easily. He is childhood friends with Kotori Hasutani and cares very much about her well being (much to Hisui's chagrin). It is hinted he likes her but has yet to mention anything. ; and : Futaba is the designated president of the health committee and isn't fond of people. Her partner is Gekko, a seven-year-old mix that is black in color and carries a few scars. Futaba can manipulate Gekko's shadow to do such things as create drones to spy on others and extend Gekko's shadow which then can as a portal for herself to pass through. She has used this to grab an enemy from far away. ; and : Tsukasa is the delegated of the cultural committee. He can control space and time to make people enter the dreams of Raimu, his partner. Raimu is a five-year-old Scottish Fold tom with white and tortoiseshell fur. He enjoys napping on the campus, preferranly on Tsukasa's head. Tsukasa and Raimu are one of the only two pairs in the series who share the same gender the other being Shin kamio and Yamato. ; and : Once the princess of all the land of Futakago, Kirihime perished when Kaen burnt her kingdom to ashes. Since then, she has reappeared to stop Kaen from continuing down his path of destruction. She and her cat, Shirayuki, then chose each of the \\"Paired Ones\\" and gave them the power to fulfill their heart's desires and fight Kaen. Shirayuki, a white cat who had died alongside Kirihime, is constantly at her side. She bears white fur and a black \\"V\\" on her chest, as well as a strange mark on her forehead that appears on the Paired Ones. ; : A tabby cat that was searching for his friend Ponta, and Yumi had decided to help him. Shinpachi learned that Ponta had been devoured while protecting Yumi from Rachi, a follower of Tsukumoishu. Shinpachi decided that, because Yumi was kind to both cats and humans, she was a fine master, and became friends with both her and Kansuke. Antagonists ; : He is the oldest of the cat deities with two tails. His fur is covered with a black oil and his preferred weapon his fire. Kaen was jealous of the success of other kingdoms of high deities, so he destroyed them. When he destroyed Futakago's kingdom, the princess and Shirayuki swore to stop him. He succeeded in escaping from his seal, slowly plotting revenge against the humans who sealed away his kind. Kaen eventually possesses Akifuji's body in order to open the barrier, but later revealed Akifuji, discovering his ancestor's plot, willingly allowed him to. ; : He is Kaen's subordinate who appeared before Yumi to kill her for her hair. Tsukumoisshu is a fox spirit that is very proud of his hair, made from the skulls of human victims, and shows anguish when discovering a single split end. He has the ability to summon followers of Kaen through special leaves. He took over the body of the vice-principal so he may freely move about the academy. ; : One of Tsukumoishu's subordinates. She possessed a human, though her true form is that of a spider. She possesses the ability to shoot webs and summon other spiders, and her spider legs are especially sharp. The spiders she summons are her \\"babies\\" and warns that if a person gets bit even once, they will die. She had to go back to the place under ground after the fight because she lost. ; : The second of Kaen's subordinates that is met, he is a wolf spirit beast. Unlike the others, he freely prefers to stay in a half- transformed state, giving his animal head and limbs to a human body. It was revealed later he had possessed Kaiya, who had allowed him in when he sensed Kibao's true nature. Unlike the rest of the spirit beasts, Kibao feels war with humans will end in disaster and only wishes for his kind to be free. ; : Another of Kaen's subordinates. He possesses a heavy-set student, but his true form is a gigantic catfish that can control the dead through mist. He was inevitably defeated by a combination effort of Yumi, Kotori, Shin, and their cats. ; : One of Kaen's subordinates, who possesses a teenage boy. His true form is a giant white dragon that possesses powerful scales that he can use as projectiles. He believes himself to be the last of his kind, but at the end of the series maintains hope that there may be more of his kind still alive. ; : The last of Kaen's subordinates to be met, she is a snake spirit beast that possesses the body of a teenage girl. She also has a younger brother; another snake who coils and drapes around her human body. The two are able to hypnotize others do their bidding or immobilize their victims. After attempting to eat Futaba and Gekko, Sakira and her brother are defeated by Tsukasa and Raimu. ; : The true antagonist of the series. He was originally Nobuhisa Sandou, a retainer to Futago and the princess's fianc√©. Sandou was the one who planned the sealing of the spirit beasts, but was mortally wounded in Kaen's invasion. In his last breath though, Sandou managed to succeed sealing the beasts away. Because of the princess's wish to become part of the barrier, as a side effect, Sandou continually reincarnated every time he died. He used this to meet with Kaen in the future, manipulating him into creating the second barrier in attempt to break the first. In truth, Sandou wanted only power and eventually succeeded, becoming invincible against the powers of the Spirit Beasts. Kaen and Akifuji, however, revealed their alliance against him and fought against him. It was revealed despite Sandou's newfound power, he was powerless against normal attacks from regular creatures. Akifuji and Kaen distracted him long enough for a depowered Kansuke to slice his throat with the Dagger of Futago held in his mouth. This causes him to lose all his powers, allowing Kaen to finish him off with his flames.

His father served as president of the canton of M√°laga; his mother was a Catholic. Bergam√≠n was influenced by both politics and religion and attempted to reconcile Communism and Catholicism throughout his life, remarking \\"I would die supporting the Communists, but no further than that.\\" Early life and career He studied law at the Universidad Central and his first articles appeared in the periodical √çndice, edited by Juan Ram√≥n Jim√©nez, in 1921 and 1922. Bergam√≠n's friendship with Jim√©nez would be as strong as the one he maintained with Miguel de Unamuno, who served as an inspiration for Bergam√≠n. Bergam√≠n's writings for √çndice would make him part of the Generation of '27 (he preferred the term ‚ÄúGeneration of the Republic‚Äù), although scholars also place him in the earlier Generation of 1914 or a member of the movement known as Novecentismo. However, his activities were very much an integral part of the Generation of '27, and he collaborated in all of the publications of this group, and served as editor of its various books. He is also considered Unamuno's principal disciple and one of the best Spanish essayists of the 20th century, with his themes covering everything from literary myths to the Golden Age of Spain, from mysticism to politics, from Spain itself to bullfighting. An opponent of the regime of Miguel Primo de Rivera, Bergam√≠n participated in a political gathering in Salamanca together with Unamuno in support of republican ideals. He also served briefly as General Director of Insurance in the Ministry of Labor during the administration of Prime Minister Francisco Largo Caballero. In 1933, he founded and served as editor of the periodical Cruz y Raya, to which numerous authors of the Generation of ‚Äô27 contributed. The last issue of Cruz y Raya, number 39, appeared in June 1936, a few days before the military uprising that would lead to the Spanish Civil War. Career during the Spanish Civil War During the Spanish Civil War, Bergam√≠n presided over the Alliance of Anti-Fascist Intellectuals (Alianza de Intelectuales Antifascistas) and was named cultural attach√© for the government-in-exile in Paris, where he looked for moral and financial support for the Spanish Republic. Bergam√≠n contributed to the periodicals El Mono Azul, Hora de Espa√±a and Cuadernos de Madrid. In 1937, he presided over, at Valencia, the second International Congress of Writers in Defense of Culture (Congreso Internacional de Escritores en Defensa de la Cultura), which gathered together more than a hundred intellectuals from all over the world. Exile With the victory of Francisco Franco over the Republican forces, Bergam√≠n went into exile, taking with him a copy of Federico Garc√≠a Lorca's Poeta en Nueva York. Bergam√≠n would serve as editor of this work by Lorca. Bergam√≠n went first to Mexico and then to Venezuela and Uruguay, and finally to France. In Mexico, he founded the magazine Espa√±a peregrina, an organ for exiled Spanish writers, and the publishing house Editorial S√©neca, which would first publish the complete works of Antonio Machado, as well as the work of Rafael Alberti, C√©sar Vallejo, Lorca, and Luis Cernuda, among others. Bu√±uel's The Exterminating Angel was based on an unfinished play Bergam√≠n had written. From 1955 to 1957, Aurora de Albornoz studied in Paris with Bergam√≠n. Return to Spain He returned to Spain in 1958, but was arrested for his previous activities as an opponent of the Nationalists during the Civil War. He was forced to go into exile again in 1963 after his apartment was burned down by his enemies, and also because he had signed a manifesto with more than 100 other intellectuals addressed to Manuel Fraga Iribarne that denounced the regime‚Äôs use of torture and repression against the miners of Asturias. He returned for good in 1970, settling in Madrid and becoming a political opponent of what he perceived were the shady deals behind the Spanish transition to democracy (La Transici√≥n), and was expelled as a writer from various newspapers. He was a republican in the first democratic elections after the transition and published the manifesto Error monarqu√≠a. At the end of his life, he lived in the Basque Country, where he served as a collaborator in the newspaper Egin and the periodical Punto y Hora de Euskal Herria, where he became a firm political supporter of the Abertzale Left. He was buried at Fuenterrab√≠a due to the fact that ‚Äúhe did not want to give his bones to Spanish earth,‚Äù since Fuenterrab√≠a is considered part of the Basque Country.

Life  He began his career under his relative Hugh of Bath, who died in 1236, leaving his chattels to Henry. Henry started his administrative career as a bailiff for the Honour of Berkhamsted in 1221, succeeding Hugh as Under-Sheriff of Berkshire from 1228 to 1229. This is the last record of his career under Hugh; from then on he was entirely independent. From 1229 to 1232 he served as Under-Sheriff for Hampshire and as High Sheriff of Gloucestershire from 1232 to 1234, a time when the county was the main base for the Marcher Wars of 1233-1234. He served as High Sheriff as an agent of Peter de Rivaux, and as such required a pardon after Peters fall from grace in 1234, Peter and his close associates having been declared traitors.  Career  Immediately after the pardon, however, he became High Sheriff of Northamptonshire, and remained in that position until 1240 other than a two-month period as both High Sheriff of Surrey and of Sussex in 1236.Oxford DNB:Bath, Henry of In 1238 he became a junior justice of the bench in Westminster, continuing to administrate Northamptonshire through deputies. Between 1240 and 1241 he worked on the Eyre Circuit for William of York as the second-most senior justice, holding an Eyre in Hampshire in 1241 in which he was the senior judge. In 1241 he went on a mission to Ireland, and on his return served for two terms as a justice Coram Rege (in the presence of the King) until 1242. After Henry III left for his trip to Gascony in 1242 he was made High Sheriff of Yorkshire, a position he held until 1248 (although it was administrated by his deputies from 1245 onwards). In 1245 he became Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas. From 1247 to 1249 he acted as the senior justice for an Eyre circuit, during which period the Court of Common Pleas did not sit. In 1249 he was again promoted, leaving his position of Chief Justice, and received a salary of over ¬£100 a year. Between 1250 and 1251 he was senior justice for another Eyre circuit, at which point he was accused of deliberately perverting the course of justice, for which his judicial position was taken, he was stripped of his position as Keeper of Gloucester Castle and he was fined 2000 marks, part of which was still unpaid when he died. Henry came back into royal favour in 1253, shortly before another of Henry's trips to Gascony, and was made Chief Justice of the Common Pleas yet again in 1256, serving until 1258 and dying in November 1260.

He has had a very long and successful career playing for several clubs all over the world, but he played most of his career in the Ecuadorian football league. especially for Ecuadorian giants Emelec, where he is its all time goal scorer and he is considered one of the best players the club has ever had. Early career Ju√°rez started his career playing for Argentine first division side Club Atl√©tico Lan√∫s, where he was quickly recognized as a promising talent for the future. In 1994, he was loaned to Uruguayan side Montevideo Wanderers where he had a fairly good season, and the next year he went back to Argentina to play for Lanus, and in 8 games he scored twice which got the attention of Mexican team Santos Laguna. He was signed by the Torre√≥n side the same year. He did not have a good season playing for Santos and he was relegated to their reserve squad. Emelec During his spell at Montevideo Wanderers former Emelec manager, Angel Castelnoble saw that Ju√°rez had great talent and took advantage of his complicated situation in Mexico signing him for Emelec in 1996. On his debut match against Espoli, Emelec won 4‚Äì0, Juarez scored twice and made the other two assists for his teammate and good friend Ariel Graziani, giving a preview of things to come. Emelec fans immediately fell in love with the forward who is now, 12 years later, Emelec's all-time top goal scorer with over 130 goals. Emelec rivals recognized Ju√°rez as a major threat to their interests in every game and they used to change their defensive style to cope with his large physique. This and Juarez great accuracy and vision to assist his teammates helped so that other forwards such as Ariel Graziani (twice), Jaime Ivan Kaviedes, Otelino Tenorio and Alejandro Kenig become Ecuadorian league top goal scorer. In 2001, Juarez managed to get that title for himself scoring 17 goals, and helping Emelec win the Ecuadorian League title. During his several years playing for Emelec, Ju√°rez left Ecuador for short periods of time to play for Peruvian team Sporting Cristal, where he became an idol, and Uruguayan side Nacional de Montevideo, where he also had a very good season. Every year speculation over his future at Emelec aroused and every year he stayed because of the high fee Emelec's management asked for Ju√°rez's contract and because Bossman's law was not applied in Ecuador at the time. To keep him satisfied Emelec officials paid Ju√°rez the highest salary of the Ecuadorian league. However, in 2004 this was insufficient to convince him to stay and he left Emelec for free, to play for Spanish side Real Murcia, becoming the first Ecuadorian player to take advantage of Bossman's law. Overall Ju√°rez played most of his career from 1996 to 2003 at Emelec, and with his help the \\"electricos\\" won two national championships in 2001 and 2002, and were runners-up in 1996, and 1998; he also played 6 Copa Libertadores and 3 Copa Merconortes, and in 2001 he was part of the Emelec squad that was runner up for the defunct Copa Merconorte. Ju√°rez will be greatly remembered by Emelec's fans for his extraordinary performances and love for the club, especially for his header in the last game of the 2001 season against El Nacional which gave the club its first title in 7 years and also because during his career he was tempted several times by Emelec's archrival Barcelona, and he always turned them down. His identification with Emelec is so strong that many times during matches against Barcelona he would wear T-shirts with sentences on them to taunt his rivals. Ecuadorian citizenship After playing and living for over 3 years in Ecuador he decided to become an Ecuadorian citizen. He got the citizenship in 1999 and in the year 2000 he made his debut with the Ecuadorian national side in the Japan-Korea FIFA world cup qualifiers match against Paraguay. Despite being one of the most successful forwards in the Ecuadorian league he did not have many opportunities with the Ecuadorian National Team, Ecuador's coach at the time, Colombian Hern√°n Dar√≠o G√≥mez, considered his and fellow nationalized player Ariel Graziani's presence to be negative for the group inside the national squad. Doping He was not successful playing in Spain for Real Murcia and in 2005 he returned to Ecuador to play for LDU Quito. He had very few games for the \\"albos\\" when after a Copa Sudamericana match he tested positive for cocaine and he was suspended for 6 months. Rumors of drug abuse where always present during Juarez's career but were always denied by the player. The 6 months suspension was the first clear proof that Ju√°rez was involved in drug consumption. However, to this day, Ju√°rez denies these accusations and claims his urine sample was switched on that test. The comeback In 2005, he completed his suspension and was signed by Deportivo Quito and after a slow start to regain form he managed to score 12 goals that season. The next season, he was re-signed by former Uruguayan team Nacional de Montevideo where he was used in the rotation of the squad. In a 2007 Copa Libertadores match against Emelec in Montevideo, Nacional won 3-1 and an extremely overweight Ju√°rez scored the Uruguayans'last goal, he was very respectful and did not celebrate the goal. However, the result sealed Emelec's elimination from the tournament that year. After Emelec's elimination from the Copa Libertadores, the club management decided to bring back Ju√°rez to play one last time for Emelec. When he arrived in Ecuador he needed some time to get back in shape, it was said that he was around 40 pounds overweight, but when he got back in shape the impact of his presence was immediate. Ju√°rez scored 6 goals and made 5 assists in 17 games for Emelec that season, and in a match against Deportivo Cuenca he scored his 134th goal for the club which made him Emelec's all-time top goal scorer, surpassing the 133 goals of former Emelec's glory, Jesus Cardenas. Despite his good performances Emelec did not qualify for the final stages of the Ecuadorian league and Ju√°rez went back to Argentina, expecting to be recalled for the next season. When Emelec was disqualified from the 2007 Ecuadorian Championship, the club held elections to select a new management. New president Elias Wated and his group work, publicly disregarded Ju√°rez as a signing for 2008, they said that he was too old, too fat, too slow, too problematic but overall too expensive for Emelec's budget. For the 2008 season, the new management struggled to find good national and foreign players especially forwards, in the meantime Ju√°rez was in Argentina handling personal businesses, later he would publicly confess that at the time he thought he was a retired player. Emelec's bad results contributed so that an Ecuadorian sports store decided to help the club and offered to sign Ju√°rez for Emelec and pay all expenses. At first the team's management was reluctant to accept this, but after the bad run continued and the pressure from the press and most importantly the fans grew, they decided to accept Ju√°rez's return. He is now part of Emelec's squad and has played in 4 games and has made 1 assists for the team which is fighting to qualify for the last stages of the league.

Biography Orlando Ribeiro was born in Lisbon, Portugal. Ribeiro devoted his life to the teaching and research of geography and is often described as one of the main reformers of this science in Portugal. He graduated in Geography and History in 1932, and completed his doctorate at the University of Lisbon in 1935. Between 1937 and 1940 (during World War II), he lived in Paris and worked at the Sorbonne University, alongside March Bloch, Emmanuel de Martonne and A. Demangeon. In 1940 he taught at the University of Coimbra, although he soon settled in his native city of Lisbon. In 1943 he founded the Centro de Estudos Geogr√°ficos (Centre for Geographical Studies). Ribeiro also lived in Goa temporarily, where he worked as a geographer for the Portuguese government. Among his publications, one book stands out: Portugal, o Mediterr√¢neo e o Atl√¢ntico [Portugal, the Mediterranean and the Atlantic] (1945). This is one of the cornerstones in his career, as he develops a detailed study on Portugal's \\"dual nature\\", or in other words, \\"a country which is Atlantic by location but mostly Mediterranean in culture\\". Yet, this book had a wide impact, since Ribeiro deepens the concepts of Atlantic Europe and Mediterranean Europe, linking central and southern Portugal to the Mediterranean culture and northern Portugal (together with Galicia) to a pan-Atlantic European culture. In fact, Ribeiro is one of the first geographers formulating the idea of Atlantic Europe as a geographical and cultural unit (it had been partially advanced by Otero Pedrayo), an idea which would be further developed by authors such as P. Flatr√®s, Emyr Estyn Evans, A. Bouhier, Meynier, J. Garc√≠a Fern√°ndez, Patrick O'Flanagan, Barry Cunliffe, Carlos Ferr√°s Sexto and Xo√°n Paredes. He visited the island of Fogo in Cape Verde which was a Portuguese possession and witnessed the 1951 eruption as he visited which lasted from June 2 to August, he came after the eruption started and also filmed it. He also wrote A Ilha do Fogo e as Suas Erup√ß√µes (Fogo Island and its Eruptions) which started publications in 1954, three years after the island's eruption and was finished in 1960, it was about the previous eruptions that occurred on the island up to 1951. On the book, he inspired a large number of pages from Baltasar Lopes da Silva's novel Chiquinho into one of its chapters. The book was awarded the Lopes de Rego Award in 1957. A small cone made out of the 1951 eruption south of Pico do Fogo (now a volcanic hill) named Monte Orlando was named for himMichel Lesourd, Le Cap-Vert aujourd'hui (Cape Verde Today), Paris, Jaguar, coll. ¬´ Aujourd'hui ¬ª, 2006, 277 p. et 286950408X, OCLC 80145890 In 1958, he later saw the eruption in Capelinhos in the west of Faial Island, Azores. In 1966, the Centro de Estudos Geogr√°ficos began to publish the geography journal Finisterra, which soon would become the main reference of geographical science in Portugal, to the present day. Ribeiro was also an accomplished photographer, and he would often take the pictures himself for his works. He died in Lisbon in 1997. Partial bibliography *A Arr√°bida.

Kanika narrates his symbolic tale about jackal, tiger, mouse, mongoose and deer and he advises that a weak ruler should ignore his own weaknesses and focus on other people's weakness and pretend to be friends while being cruel and destructive to others, particularly when the competition is good and stronger. Dhritarashtra schemes to build a home for Pandavas in the forest, from lacquer and other inflammable materials as a friendly gesture, but with plans to burn them alive on the darkest night. Kanika's theory is called wicked and evil by Vidura, a sage of true knowledge and the good, who is also the advisor and friend to Pandavas. Vidura and Pandavas plan escape by building a tunnel inside the inflammable house. The fire is lit and the Pandavas escape. Dhritarashtra falsely believes Pandavas are dead.

English Translations Bhishma taking his bhishma pratigya is shown in Adi Parva Adi Parva and other books of Mahabharata are written in Sanskrit. Several translations of the Adi Parva are available in English. To translations whose copyrights have expired and which are in public domain, include those by Kisari Mohan Ganguli and Manmatha Nath Dutt. Adi Parva describes Mahabharata as being recited before sages because its scope includes all knowledge known. The translations are not consistent in parts and vary with each translator's interpretations. For example: Translation by Manmatha Nath Dutt: Translation by Kisari Mohan Ganguli: The total number of original verses depend on which Sanskrit source is used, and these do not equal the totalnumber of translated verses in each chapter, in both Ganguli and Dutt translations. Mahabharata, like many ancient Sanskrit texts, was transmitted across generations verbally, a practice that was a source of corruption of its text, deletion of verses as well as the addition of extraneous verses over time. Some of these suspect verses have been identified by change in style and integrity of meter in the verses. The structure, prose, meter and style of translations vary within chapters between the translating authors. Debroy, in his 2011 overview of Mahabharata, notes that updated critical edition of Adi Parva, with spurious and corrupted text removed, has 19 sub-books, 225 adhyayas (chapters) and 7,205 shlokas (verses). Controversies Janmejaya conducts snake sacrifice where Mahabharata is narrated for the first time Adi Parva, and Mahabharata in general, has been studied for evidence of caste- based social stratification in ancient India, as well as evidence for a host of theories about Vedic times in India. Such studies have become controversial. First, the date and authenticity of the verses in Adi Parva, as well as the entire Mahabharata, has been questioned. Klaus Klostermaier, in his review of scholarly studies of Mahabharata, notes the widely held view that original Mahabharata was different from currently circulating versions. For centuries, the Mahabharatas 1, 00, 000 verses‚Äîfour times the entire Bible and nine times the Iliad and the Odyssey combined‚Äîwere transmitted verbally across generations, without being written down. This memorization and verbal method of transfer is believed to be a source of text corruption, addition and deletion of verses. Klostermaier notes that the original version of Mahabharata was called Jaya and had about 7000 shlokas or about 7% of current length. Adi Parva, and rest of Mahabharata, underwent at least two major changes - the first change tripled the size of Jaya epic and renamed it as Bharata, while the second change quadrupled the already expanded version. Significant changes to older editions have been traced to the first millennium AD. There are significant differences in Sanskrit manuscripts of the Mahabharata found in different parts of India and manuscripts of the Mahabharata found in other Indian languages such as Tamil, Malayalam, Telugu and others. Numerous spurious additions, interpolations and conflicting verses have been identified, many relating to history and social structure. Thus, it is unclear if the history or social structure of Vedic period or ancient India can be reliably traced from Adi Parva or Mahabharata. Second, Adi Parva is part of an Epic fiction. Writers, including those such as Shakespeare or Homer, take liberty in developing their characters and plots, they typically represent extremes and they do not truthfully record extant history. Adi Parva has verses with a story of a river fish swallowing a man's semen and giving birth to a human baby after 9 months and many other myths and fictional tales. Adi Parva, like the works of Home and Shakespeare, is not a record of history. Third, Adi Parva and other parvas of Mahabharata have been argued, suggests Klaus Klostermaier, as a treatise of symbolism, where each chapter has three different layers of meaning in its verses. The reader is painted a series of pictures through words, presented opposing views to various socio-ethical and moral questions, then left to interpret it on astikadi, manvadi and auparicara levels; in other words, as mundane interesting fiction, or as ethical treatise, or thirdly as transcendental work that draws out the war between the higher and the lower self within each reader. To deduce history of ancient India is one of many discursive choices for the interpreter. Quotations & Teachings The creation of universe by the churning of the ocean - this story is told in many ancient Indian scripts, including the initial chapters of Adi Parva.

Biography Washington was born in Charleston, South Carolina, the United States on May 26, 1921. He attended the Avery Institute and subsequently Lincoln University. Washington graduated from the Philadelphia Divinity School of the Episcopal Church. He did his pastoral work at the Church of the Crucifixion at 8th and Bainbridge Streets in South Philadelphia, where he met his future wife Christine. Immediately after marriage in 1947, Washington and his wife went to Liberia as missionaries. There, Washington served as business manager of Cuttington College during its post-war revival and rebuilding, Cuttington went on to educate many African leaders. For a time Washington was its acting president. The couple returned from Liberia to Philadelphia in 1954 because their son Paul Marc was suffering from repeated malaria attacks. At this time, he was appointed Vicar of St. Cyprian's Episcopal Church in the Elmwood (now Eastwick) section of Philadelphia. In 1962, Washington was made rector of the George W. South Memorial Church of the Advocate in Philadelphia, a position he held for 25 years until his retirement in 1987. During his years at the Advocate, Washington served as Episcopal Chaplain at Eastern State Penitentiary. He served on the MOVE Commission established by then-Mayor Wilson Goode to investigate the May 13, 1985 aerial bombing by Philadelphia police of a rowhouse fortified by MOVE members and the ensuing conflagration that killed 11 people and destroyed 61 homes. The Commission found the bombing \\"unconscionable\\" and suggested methods the city of Philadelphia might use to prevent similar future situations. Washington also served as the chaplain of the Advocate Communities Development Corporation's (ACDC) Board of Directors. He continued to serve ACDC until the fall of 1998. ACDC was established by his wife, Christine, and constructed multimillion-dollar projects, rehab and new construction for those in need. Over 400 units of housing have been added to the North Philadelphia community. In 1994, the Temple University Press published \\"Other Sheep I Have\\": the Autobiography of Father Paul M. Washington, written with David McI. Gracie.http://www.temple.edu/tempress/titles/1036_reg.html. Accessed March 18, 2013 Washington died October 7, 2002. He was known and revered in particular for his advocacy of the oppressed and disadvantaged. He was called the \\"conscience of the city\\". Career as social and religious advocate During his 25 years at the Advocate, he was recognized as one of the key leaders of the Black Power movement. When there was nowhere else for gatherings to be held, Washington would allow them to meet at the Advocate. He hosted the third National Conference on Black Power in 1968, attended by thousands of delegates from across the U.S. Two years later he hosted the Convention of the Black Panther Party. Huey Newton was one of the speakers. In 1971, the Church of the Advocate was the site for the rally to raise money for the Angela Davis Defense Fund. The 1970s also marked Washington's increasing involvement in another area of inequality, the role of women in the Episcopal Church. At the Church of the Advocate on July 29, 1974, Washington participated in the irregular ceremony in which the first eleven women were ordained into the priesthood in this denomination, as the Philadelphia Eleven. accessed 11/17/09 The ordination sermon was, however, delivered by a layman, Charles V. Willie who, at the time, was Vice President of the House of Deputies of the Episcopal Church. The ordination proved highly controversial as many members of the Episcopal Church were reluctant to acknowledge the priesthood of women. Washington was formally admonished by the bishop of Pennsylvania, Lyman Ogilvy, for allowing the Church of the Advocate to be used as the venue for the ordination, and the validity of the ordination itself was disputed. Meeting in emergency session in Chicago, the House of Bishops of the Episcopal Church invalidated the ordination by a vote of 128 to 9 because the four officiating bishops had \\"not fulfilled constitutional and canonical requirements\\". This event marked a new era for both the Episcopal Church and the Church of the Advocate. Ultimately, in 1977, the Episcopal church did make rules changes to accept women priests. In 1989, Washington delivered the principal address at the consecration in Boston, Massachusetts, of the Reverend Barbara C. Harris, a protege of Washington's, as the first female Episcopal bishop. During the Iran hostage crisis, at the request of former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark, Washington was one of ten Americans who participated in a June 1980 international peace conference entitled \\"Crimes of America\\" in Iran. The group's trip was in conscious defiance of a ban on travel to Iran and exposed each delegate to fines of up to $50,000 and imprisonment for up to 10 years. There were calls across the country for investigation and prosecution of the delegates.

Extraordinary rendition They reported on the secret deportation of two Egyptians in what was one of the first operations known as extraordinary rendition. The two men, Ahmed Agiza and Muhammed al-Zery, were taken from Bromma airport in Sweden in December 2001 to Egypt in a covert operation by US agents and handed over to Egyptian security services and were subsequently tortured.Swedish TV4 Kalla Fakta Program: \\"The Broken Promise\\" (English Transcript) Monday,17 May 2004Swedish TV4 Kalla Fakta Program: \\"The Broken Promise\\", Part II (English Transcript) Monday, 24 May 2004 The story caused a major uproar in Sweden, drew international attention and was one of the first to shed light on \\"Extraordinary Rendition\\". The plane uncovered in the report as the one used in the rendition was a US registered Gulfstream V with the registration number N379P. It was found by the reporters, and their partners in the reporting like UK-reporter Stephen Grey to be part of a much larger fleet of planes used for rendition operations.Ghost Plane: The True Story of the CIA Rendition and Torture Program, Stephen Grey, Macmillan, 2007, In September 2008, Bergman and his colleagues received the ICIJ Daniel Perl award for their 2006 report in National TV4 \\"The Illegal Cod\\" on the illegal fishing in the Barents Sea. and in November 2009 were appointed Environmental journalist of the year for \\"Pink Gold\\" on the (un-)sustainable farming of salmon. In 2013, the trio started publishing a story on the state owned Swedish Telecom giant Telia Sonera. In April 2014 a one-hour documentary could expose how the company cooperated with oppressive regimes in a business region the company called \\"Eurasia\\" that included long time dictatorships like Uzbekistan and Azerbadjan. In September 2016 the first reportage on how the company also bribed their way to these markets was published which after several subsequent reports led to the resignation of the company's CEO Lars Nyberg (2013) and the board. In 2015 Telia Sonera declared that it was selling all its assets in \\"Eurasia\\" - and the loss to the biggest owner - the Swedish state - was estimated at 20 BN SEK Dagens Industry. The recipient of Telia Soneras payments for Uzbek licenses, Gulnara Karimova the daughter to the long time dictator Islam Karimov, was deposed by her father because of the international scandal following the publication.

As a consequence of territorial disputes both countries had begun to increase their military budgets and an arms race ensued in the 1890s.

Wat Pa Ban Tat was set up by a famous Thai meditation bhikkhu called Venerable Ajahn Maha Bua.  History of Ban Tat Monastery  In 1950 Ajahn Maha Bua looked for a quiet, secluded place, and so he went to stay at Huey Sai village, in what is now Mukdahan Province. During his stay here he was very strict and serious in teaching the monks and novices, both in the subject of the austere dhutanga practices as well as in meditation. He pursued this method of teaching until these same principles of practice became increasingly established within his followers. He then learned that his mother was ill and so returned to his village near Udon Thani so that he might look after her. Back at home, villagers and relatives requested that he settle in the forested area south of the village. They also asked him to make his residence permanent, as a favor to them, and to no longer wander in the manner of a forest monk. Through the donation of a piece of land of approximately , he would be able to establish a monastery. Considering that his mother was very old and that it was appropriate for him to look after her, he accepted the offer and began to build this monastery in November 1955. It was named Wat Pa Ban Tat. > \\"This monastery has always been a place for meditation. Since the beginning > it has been a place solely for developing the mind. I haven‚Äòt let any other > work disturb the place. If there are things which must be done, I‚Äòve made it > a rule that they take up no more time than is absolutely necessary. The > reason for this is that, in the eyes of the world and the Dhamma, this is a > meditation temple. We‚Äòre meditation monks. The work of the meditation monk > was handed over to him on the day of his ordination by his Preceptor - in > all its completeness. This is his real work, and it was taught in a form > suitable for the small amount of time available during the ordination > ceremony - five meditation objects to be memorized in forward and reverse > order - and after that it‚Äòs up to each individual to expand on them and > develop them to whatever degree of breadth or subtlety he is able to. In the > beginning the work of a monk is given simply as: Kesa - hair of the head, > Loma - hair of the body, Nakha - nails, Danta - teeth, Taco - the skin which > enwraps the body. This is the true work for those monks who practice > according to the principles of Dhamma as were taught by the Lord Buddha.‚Äú  The Wat and tigers Along the Khon Kaen - Udon Thani highway, at kilometer-post 555, 7 kilometers from the town of Udon Thani, is an intersection in front of Kum Gling village. Here is a sign and an arrow pointing out the tarmac road to Ban Tat village. Eight kilometers further down the road from Ban Tat village is a piece of land cool, shady and quiet. It is covered with forest well looked after, and protected by a concrete wall that encircles the area. Since this monastery was established 30 years ago, the general condition of the forest remains as it originally was, lush in vegetation of many types and home to many types of forest animals. The overall view is that of forest hilltop surrounded by rice fields. This is probably the only unspoiled piece of forest left in Mueng district, Udon Thani Province. > \\"There were three tigers and about three leopards that came and went. The > leopards walked around the dwellings but weren‚Äòt interested in human beings, > only the dogs. They‚Äòre used to eating animals, like dogs, which are > dependent on man, and so whenever they hear a human voice anywhere, they‚Äòll > sneak right in and peep around, looking here and there.

And > these were big cats, so how could we help but see their tracks?‚Äú The wilderness surrounding the monastery has disappeared since the area has been cleared for cultivation. The forest that remains inside the domain of the monastery is only a remnant of what the forest once was. Wat Pa Ban Tat has tried to conserve its remnant of the forest in its original, natural condition, so that monks, novices, and lay people can make use of its tranquility for the practice of the Dhamma taught by the Lord Buddha. As the Venerable Acariya has taught repeatedly: > \\"From a desire to make this teaching a reality, and not just a ceremony, > comes a model for a lifestyle devoted towards serious practice. As a > consequence, life goes on here with the utmost simplicity - making do with > what little one has - and with great contentment.\\"  The Relics of Saints  In the display case stand urns containing the relics of Venerable Ajahn Sao Kantasilo Mahathera, Venerable Ajahn Mun, and Venerable Acariya Sing Khatayakhamo of Wat Pa Salawan. There also are pictures of the Elder Meditation Masters who followed them in the forest meditation tradition. These include: Venerable Acariya Waen Suchinno, Venerable Acariya Khao Analayo,http://www.luangta.com/English/site/books.php Venerable Ajahn Lee Dhammadharo of Wat Asokaram, and Venerable Ajahn Fun Ajaro. To these images, pictures and relics, the monks and novices pay their respects every morning and evening. From the sala are many paths running off towards the areas assigned as dwelling places for the monks and novices. The dwelling structures themselves - called kutis - are single units scattered throughout the dense forest. They stand fairly far apart and are separated from each other by strips of forest dense enough so that the inhabitants can't see one another. The whole area is tranquil and quiet, more so than the front area of the monastery which we have just mentioned. A monk will stay alone at his kuti without interactions with others. He spends all his time concentrating on his own practice - exerting himself in the practice of sitting and walking meditation in the area of his own kuti as if he were the only person around. He doesn't stop to chat with others, but follows in full detail the methods and forest practices taught by the Lord Buddha.

He later became 54th Lord of the Manor of Solihull. Early years Short was born on 30 December 1783 in Solihull, Warwickshire. He was born to John and Jane Short, n√©e Mashiter. John Short was a well-known and respected surgeon in Solihull and Jane was from an aristocratic family on her mother's side. Thus, Robert Short had a comfortable childhood and enjoyed the way of life that Solihull and the surrounding area afforded him; 'Urbs in rure' (town in the country) is the town's motto. Short was educated at Solihull School with his five brothers. He was well-known within the school even prior to his acceptance. His maternal grandfather, Rev. Richard Mashiter, had been Headmaster until 1769 and his father was a Feoffee; a position he held for 57 years. The young Short is said to have enjoyed his days at Solihull and always showed sporting talent. Career Following Solihull School Short joined the Army of the Honourable East India Company and achieved the rank of lieutenant-colonel in the 21st Madras Native Infantry at a high point in the Company rule in India. He retired as an Honorary Colonel on 9 September 1830. He was offered another job by the East India Company in India although upon his return to England he married Mary Astle in 1835 and so wanted to remain in the marital home. He took several jobs as a Justice of the Peace in 1838 and served for a 20-year period. He was also elected to the position of Guardian of the Poor Law Union and then as its Chairman. During his career he commended Solihull School to traders and his fellow officers resulting in an increase in reputation of the school. Latter years He purchased the Lordship of the Manor of Solihulli in 1850 to become 54th Lord of the Manor. He died in 1859 aged 75 and was buried at St Alphege on 2 July. Under his will the Lordship of the Manor passed to the Rev. John Couchman, eldest son of his sister Elizabeth. The Couchmans, who still live locally, remain Lords of the Manor. The Manor House, renamed Manor Cottage, passed to Robert‚Äôs younger brother, Tomas who was Deputy Master at Rugby School having been beaten to the Headmastership by one Dr Thomas Arnold.

It was the first time American Troops fought a ground-based battle against the Taliban within Pakistani borders. The raid took place at the same time as Pakistani military forces ended a four-week offensive in Bajaur, the northernmost Agency of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas of which South Waziristan is the southernmost, an offensive that has displaced approximately half a million people.  Operations  By September 2008, the trail of intelligence to find Osama bin Laden, had gone cold, and then-Vice Admiral William McRaven wanted to jump-start the effort. The target of the raid was a minor al-Qaeda facilitator. The raid was carried out by JSOC Operators, believed to be from DEVGRU's Blue Squadron. The raid occurred in the village of M≈´sƒÅ Nƒ´k…ô () of the Angur Ada region of South Waziristan, Pakistan, less than one mile (1.6 km) from the border of Afghanistan. The operation was executed at 3:00 AM local time (23h00 in UTC).American Forces Attack Militants on Pakistani Soil Though the U.S. has performed missile strikes in Pakistan before, this is reportedly the first time U.S. troops have taken ground action within the country against Taliban fighters. According to some early reports, roughly twenty people, possibly including three women and four children, were killed in the raid.Suspected US commandos kill 20 in S Waziristan raid However, it is not clear whether these were civilians or combatants; an American official stated that the women killed were helping the hostile militants. CH-47 Chinook helicopters carrying 45 U.S. Navy SEALs conducted the raid. Only one of the helicopters landed and unloaded, while the two others flew overhead providing surveillance and aerial support to the other team.American Forces Attack Militants on Pakistani Soil (p. 2) Two F-16 fighter jets also provided air cover. The forces attacked three houses, owned by \\"Faujan Wazir, Faiz Mohammad and Nazar Jan Wazir.\\" The entire operation lasted 30 minutes. All of the inhabitants were apparently asleep when the raid occurred, other sources say that as the SEALs scaled the walls of a compound, a resident opened fire on them with a shotgun and women inside began throwing themselves on the SEALs whilst the male occupants fled the houses. After examination, none of the dead proved to be \\"important terrorists or high-value targets.\\"Zardari says fighting terror is Pakistani priority A U.S. military official stated that \\"a small number of militants [were] captured and several others killed,\\" but refused to comment on exact numbers.  Response  A statement made by the Government of Pakistan said that \\"a strong protest by [the] Foreign Office has been lodged with [the] Government of United States,\\" and \\"such acts of aggression do not serve the common cause of fighting terrorism and militancy in the area.\\" On September 4, the Pakistani parliament passed a resolution condemning the raid and demanding increased American oversight and cooperation with Pakistani officials when conducting covert operations. Anne W. Patterson, the United States Ambassador to Pakistan, was called to the Pakistan Foreign Office, where a protest was lodged. In response to the raid, Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi told the National Assembly on Thursday, \\"There is no high-value target or known terrorist among the dead ... Only innocent civilians, including women and children, have been targeted.\\" In response to the raid, United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said, \\"I don't have anything for you on Pakistan, except to say that obviously we are working very closely with the civilian government there.\\" Rice refused to comment on the possibility of civilian casualties. Reuters cited U.S. Pentagon officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, who confirmed that the raid was conducted by U.S. special operations forces.

The Palme d'Or went to The Silent World by Jacques-Yves Cousteau and Louis Malle. The festival opened with Marie-Antoinette reine de France, directed by Jean Delannoy and closed with Il tetto by Vittorio De Sica. In an effort to resolve some issues caused by the Cold War climate of the time, like special treatment towards Americans (who gave financial assistance to the festival) which displeased the Eastern Bloc, a decision to have films withdrawn under certain conditions had been put in place. This decision in turn had become a divisive issue in the festival, as it was seen as censorship. In 1956 it was decided to eliminate all such censorship from the selection and thereby start a new era in the festival.

They are often generally described as indie rock but are known to utilize a variety of genres and styles. The band's debut album Checkmate Savage was released in January 2009 (rereleased on vinyl in January 2019) and the follow up The Wants in October 2010. In June 2014, the band released their third record, Strange Friend followed by Fears Trending in January 2015.  Early history (2002-2008) The band initially performed and released material under various names, never sticking with the same band-name for long: NRA, Les Crazy Boyz, Los Crayzee Boyz, Tower of Girls, Wooden Trees. In 2005, using the adopted name Robert Redford, the band released a one-off CDR titled The Mummy and Daddy Dance on their own temporary label Extreme Nudity, self distributed to independent record outlets in the UK, before removing all reference to it from their online presence and reforming under a new name, Robert Louis Stevenson. The sought-after release now only changes hands on online auction sites, and the only element traceable from the band's current incarnation is the presence of the track \\"Crocodile\\" (formerly \\"Crocodile Dundee\\") on their 2009 album Checkmate Savage. Under the title of Robert Louis Stevenson, they played a number of live shows in Glasgow (Stereo, Nice'n'Sleazy) and Edinburgh (Wee Red Bar) and released a limited run of 150 audio cassettes under band member Nobodaddy (Wake's DJing alter-ego) and Hugo Paris' home imprint, Sweat on Cassette. Regarding the band's early name changes vocalist Rick Anthony states: > We never really took things too seriously to start with so we didn‚Äôt think > twice about changing our name so much, or asking promoters to pick ones for > us. I guess it could be considered a little perverse, but it allowed us the > freedom to experiment with different forms of music, and it was also kind of > fun. I think we gradually realised that it was potentially as alienating for > people as it was amusing for us, and once we had played a few shows under > the name The Phantom Band, without anyone complaining, it made sense to > stick with it. Also, by that point, we had reached a level of musical > expression that was more in tune with what we were aiming for as a band, so > I think we were all a bit more comfortable with the idea of settling on > something. In 2006, the band began using The Phantom Band as their name (apparently in reference to their elusive activities up to that point) and, in 2007, released a 7\\" single, \\"Throwing Bones\\", on the London-based Trial & Error Recordings. The critical acclaim of this single, their first fully distributed release, was the impetus for their signing to Chemikal Underground. Prior to the release of their debut album the band appeared at a number of UK festivals including Hydro Connect 2008 (Your Sound Bandstand), Tales of the Jackalope 2007 (Unspecified Stage), The Wickerman Festival, 20 July 2007 (Solus Stage), and the Wye Fayre 2007, 7 July 2007 (Flying Monkey Stage), They also played their first show outside the United Kingdom at the Crossing Border festival in Den Haag, the Netherlands in November 2008. Checkmate Savage (2008-2010) After signing with Chemikal Underground the band began recording their debut album early in 2008. Despite planning on recording the album in a few weeks in the labels Chem19 studios in Blantyre, the whole session ended up spanning many months and was mixed at Franz Ferdinand's studios in Govan. Checkmate Savage was eventually released in January 2009 to critical acclaim and it peaked on the UK Albums Chart at number 181 in February of that year. The release of Checkmate Savage led to several UK and European tours for the band including sell-out shows in Glasgow King Tuts, London Macbeth, Inverness Hootananny and Manchester Deaf Institute. They also played in venues across Germany, France, Ireland, Belgium, the Netherlands and Switzerland. Festival appearances during this period include: T in the Park, Belladrum, Stag and Dagger (which took place in Leeds, London and Glasgow), London Calling in Amsterdam, the Storasfestivalen near Trondheim, The Great Escape in Brighton, Sound City in Liverpool and, towards the end of 2009, the Transmusicales festival in Rennes. Early in 2010, the band once again returned to Chem19 to begin work on their second album. The Wants (2010-2011) The recording sessions for the band's second album were quite difficult - even more so than the first record. Much of the music was written in the studio and under quite tight time constraints and this seems to have led to some difficulties within the band. Sometime in the summer of 2010, between the records completion and its release, the band parted ways with original drummer Damien Tonner. The band made a number of festival appearances around this time including the Commercial Alternative] festival in Glasgow, the Standon Calling Festival and the Electric Elephant Festival in Croatia. The Wants was released in October 2010 to critical acclaim. On the day of its release the band travelled to the United States of America to appear at the CMJ festival in New York. Directly after this the band supported Frightened Rabbit on a string of dates during their headline tour including shows in Boston, Philadelphia, Washington, New York and Chicago. On returning to the United Kingdom the band embarked on a small tour of their own culminating in a sold out show at Oran Mor in Glasgow. In March 2011, they completed a two-month tour of Europe. Beginning in Ireland at the end of January the group then travelled through France, Switzerland, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Belgium, the Netherlands and Great Britain. Throughout the summer of 2011 the band appeared on the stages of many UK and European festivals including: Latitude (Suffolk), The Great Escape Festival (Brighton), Friends of Mine (Manchester), Walk the Line (Den Haag), A.F.F. (Genk), Tramlines (Sheffield), Camden Crawl (London), Summer Sundae (Leicester), Belladrum (Inverness-shire) and T in the Park (Kinross-shire). At the T in the Park festival, the band recorded a live acoustic version of the track \\"Everybody Knows it's True\\" for the final show of the BBC's festival coverage. In December 2011, The Phantom Band rounded off the year by staging two shows in conjunction with arts collective 85A in Glasgow's Stereo venue entitled 'A Phestive Phantomime' and featuring performance art, films and live performances from a variety of bands. Strange Friend and Fears Trending (2014-2015) The band returned to the studio in 2013 to record the follow up to The Wants. Largely self-produced, their third record Strange Friend was released on 2 June 2014 followed by a short tour of the United Kingdom and several summer festival dates. Later in 2014 the band announced the release of their fourth studio album, Fears Trending. The album came out on 26 January 2015. It was recorded during the same sessions as the band's previous album. In October 2015 the band embarked on a European tour. They played in Berlin, Munich, Vienna, Hamburg, Cologne, Luxembourg, Zurich, Paris and Lille. After the gig in Lille on 20 October 2015 all of the band's equipment, worth over ¬£13,000, was stolen from their tour van. The remaining dates of the tour in Brighton and Liverpool were cancelled and, despite strong support, the band have not played live since.

He commanded the 2nd Netherlands Division at the Battle of Quatre Bras and the Battle of Waterloo. Biography Family Life Perponcher was the son of Cornelis, baron de Perponcher Sedlnitsky, (scion of an old Huguenot Dutch family and of old Czech noble family that had fled Bohemia after the 1621 Battle of White Mountain), a justice in the Hof van Holland (the high court of the province of Holland), and Jonkvrouwe Johanna Maria van Tuyll van Serooskerke. Though the family was not part of the Dutch nobility under the Dutch Republic it had acquired a number of Heerlijkheden, like many Regents, which gave it a de facto aristocratic status. When King William I of the Netherlands reorganized, and greatly extended, the Dutch nobility in 1815, the family De Perponcher Sedlnitsky was inducted into the Dutch nobility with the title of baron. Perponcher was himself elevated to the rank of hereditary count by the King in 1825.Van der Aa, p. 191 Perponcher married Adelaide, countess Van Reede on 2 October 1816. They had three sons and a daughter. The three sons all went into Prussian government service and achieved high rank.Winkler Prins, p. 187 Early career Perponcher entered the service of the Dutch Republic as a cadet in a regiment of dragoons in 1788. He was promoted to captain in 1792, and appointed aide-de-camp to Prince Willem George Frederik of Orange-Nassau, a younger son of stadtholder William V, Prince of Orange. With him he took part in the campaigns of the War of the First Coalition (he saved the Prince's life at the battle of Werwick of 13 September 1793) until the Republic was overrun by the revolutionary French armies and the Batavian Republic was proclaimed in 1795. Perponcher then followed his master into Austrian service, where Prince Frederik became a general. He was wounded at the siege of Kehl. When Prince Frederik died on 6 January 1799 in Padua during an Austrian campaign in Italy, Perponcher transferred his allegiance to the British. He obtained a commission in a regiment of J√§ger in British pay as a major. This regiment was sent to Egypt to fight the French in the Egypt and Syria Campaign of 1800-1801. He was wounded at the Battle of Alexandria. In 1804 he transferred as a major to Dillon's Regiment,This was a loyal Irish regiment, raised by Edward Dillon in 1795. It should therefore be distinguished from the famous Dillon's regiment that was part of the Irish Brigade (French) until 1792. which he soon thereafter commanded as a lieutenant-colonel in the Malta garrison. In 1808 he was put in charge of the Loyal Lusitanian Legion as a colonel in the Peninsular War. He did not see action there, however, because he was recalled to England to become chief-of-staff of the Earl of Rosslyn's's light division in the Walcheren Campaign of 1809, where he saw action against his Dutch compatriots (now part of the Kingdom of Holland). After that campaign ended he resigned his British commission under threat of forfeiture of his Dutch possessions by Napoleon I of France, who annexed the Netherlands in 1810 and frowned on his new subjects serving in hostile armies. Though without official duties, he was very active in Orangist circles during the next few years, which explains why he was selected as one of the emissaries of the Van Hogendorp triumvirate (that seized power in October 1813, in the Netherlands) to Prince William to invite him to become Sovereign Prince of the Netherlands. The Prince soon afterwards promoted him to major-general and put him in charge of the nascent new Dutch army. He led the campaign against the retreating French, and besieged the fortresses of Gorinchem, Bergen op Zoom, and Antwerp in late 1813 and early 1814. After the First Peace of Paris in 1814 he was for the first time appointed Dutch minister plenipotentiary at the Prussian court in Berlin. Hundred Days Campaign Perponcher was recalled from Berlin when Napoleon escaped from Elba in March 1815. He was put in charge of the new 2nd Netherlands Division with the rank of lieutenant- general. This division was partially (second brigade under major-general Saxe- Weimar) bivouacked at Quatre Bras, partially (first brigade under major- general Van Bylandt) at Nivelles on the fateful night of 15 June 1815. When Saxe-Weimar received orders from the Duke of Wellington to evacuate the strategic crossroads at Quatre Bras, he alerted Perponcher, because he thought that could not be right, and Perponcher took the matter up with major-general Jean Victor de Constant Rebecque, the chief-of-staff of the Netherlands Mobile Army. Together they decided to countermand Wellington's order, and Perponcher also sent his other brigade to take up positions at Quatre Bras. (1908) La campagne de 1815 aux Pays-Bas d'apr√®s les rapports officiels n√©erlandais, Tome 1, pp. 395-411 The two brigades together (though far outnumbered) managed to hold off the onslaught of the French left wing under Marshal Michel Ney long enough the next day to allow Wellington to bring up British reinforcements. The allies defeated the French at the Battle of Quatre Bras on June 16. The next day the Anglo-Dutch army performed a strategic retreat to the environs of Waterloo. Here Wellington decided to split up Perponcher's division (though leaving him in charge). The Saxe-Weimar brigade was put on the extreme left wing of the Allied army; the Bylandt brigade was eventually placed between the British brigades of Pack and Kempt. The placement of the Bylandt brigade at the beginning of the battle of Waterloo is the subject of some controversy, as many historians erroneously place the brigade in an exposed position, due to faulty staff work. Others credit Perponcher with giving the order to move the brigade to a safer position before the initial French bombardment started around noon on 18 June. However, apparently Perponcher only executed an order from Wellington through the intermediary of the prince of Orange.Muilwijk, p. 5 Both brigades performed well (despite what some British historians have written about the conduct of the Bylandt brigade, which ought to be contradicted by the appallingly high casualty figures of this brigade). Perponcher was in the thick of it, steadying the militia battalions of the Bylandt brigade after Bylandt had been forced to relinquish command, and leading them in a counterattack. He was made a Knight Commander of the Military William Order on 18 July 1815 in recognition. Diplomatic career After the Battle of Waterloo Perponcher was right away returned to his post as Dutch envoy to the Prussian Court in Berlin. He remained in this post until 1842. At his retirement he was promoted to full general. Apparently these many years in Berlin completely assimilated his three sons (born in 1819, 1821 and 1827) to their new environment. They all entered Prussian diplomatic or military service, where they achieved high rank. (One was chamberlain of Emperor Wilhelm I). Perponcher died in Dresden in 1856.

Late in life, after a long career in the Manhattan Project and at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, he became a critic of nuclear power and nuclear weapons production. Born in Enochville, North Carolina, Karl Morgan attended Lenoir-Rhyne College (now University) as a freshman and sophomore and then transferred to the University of North Carolina, where he graduated with bachelor's and master's degrees in physics and mathematics. He continued graduate study in physics at Duke University, where he received a PhD degree in 1934 for research into cosmic radiation. He began an academic career as a faculty member at Lenoir Rhyne College, but in 1943 was recruited to work in the secret project to develop an atomic bomb.Pearce Wright, Karl Morgan, The Guardian, Tuesday 15 June 1999Leland R. Johnson, Karl Z. Morgan, Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture Initially at the University of Chicago Metallurgical Laboratory and later in Oak Ridge, Morgan joined a small group of physicists who were interested in the health effects of radiation.Dick Smyser, \\"Founder of the science of health physics and also a pioneer of the environmental movement,\\" The Oak Ridger, June 24, 1999 Morgan became director of health physics at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), serving from the late 1940s until his retirement in 1972. In 1955 he became the first president of the Health Physics Society, and was editor of the journal Health Physics from 1955 to 1977.Angry Genie: One Man's Walk Through the Nuclear Age After his retirement from ORNL, he joined the faculty of Georgia Institute of Technology as professor of nuclear energy in the school of nuclear engineering, retiring from that position in 1982, when he became a consulting professor at Appalachian State University.\\"Dr. Karl Z. Morgan; Pioneer health physicist,\\" The Oak Ridger, June 10, 1999 After decades as a \\"pillar of the nuclear establishment\\", Morgan had a \\"change of heart\\" about nuclear weapons production and nuclear power. He began to offer court testimony which was friendly to people who said they had been harmed by nuclear weapons and the nuclear power industry. In October 1982, he testified in a lawsuit brought by nearly 1,200 people who accused the government of negligence in atomic weapons testing at the Nevada Test Site in the 1950s, which they said had caused leukemia and other cancers. Morgan, then 75 years old, testified that radiation protection measures in the tests were substandard.Karl Z. Morgan, 91, Founder of the Field Of Health Physics, Dies in Tennessee Morgan also testified on behalf of Navajo uranium miners and their survivors, saying government officials had known about mine radiation dangers but had not protected the miners. He also testified in the case of Karen Silkwood against Kerr-McGee. Morgan's autobiography, The Angry Genie: One Man's Walk Through the Nuclear Age was published in 1999 by the University of Oklahoma Press. He died in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, on June 8, 1999, apparently from a ruptured aortic aneurysm.K.Z. Morgan, health physics pioneer, dies, ORNL Reporter, July 1999 PhD John Cameron, the developer of a more accurate dosimeter in the 1960s, was however a major critic of Morgan's error prone autobiography that was otherwise interesting for its historical detailing of the Manhattan Project's health physics evolution.

( La Fievre du Tresor) is the first book of the Schooling Around series by Andy Griffiths. It was published in April 2008 by Pan Macmillan Australia. Plot Henry McThrottle waits with his friends Jack, a drawer; panphobic Newton, muscular Gretel, sociable Jenny, and brainiac Fiona for their teacher Mrs. Chalkboard to come. Mr. Greenbeard, the school principal and naval buff comes to the class to announce the new substitute teacher Mr. Brainfright who will replace Mrs. Chalkboard while she's sick. It becomes immediately apparent that Mr. Brainfright doesn't know a thing about teaching, and proceeds to make his first lesson about how to breathe. This results in him nearly falling out the window, to where the whole class successfully pulls him back in, and where Mrs. Cross is introduced. Mr. Brainfright continues to tell the class about a riddle where a man has a goat, a wolf and some cabbage, and he needs to cross a river, with the reward being a lollipop. Henry correctly answers the riddle using spitballs thrown to him by Clive Durkin, the class bully. At recess Clive and his brother Fred claim that the lollipop is his, because Henry used Clive's spitballs to help him work it out. Fred and Henry then have a fight, until Mrs Cross stops it and send Henry to the office. Henry explains the problem to Mr. Greenbeard, who understands as a similar thing happened to him when he was younger. Mr. Greenbeard had a treasure chest full of things that he had, buried in a hill that he named \\"Skull Island\\", which had been stolen. Mr. Greenbeard recited the poem that was left in the chest, which inspires Henry to look for it. He enlists his friends Jack, Newton, Gretel, and Jenny to help him. The next day, Mr. Brainfright attempts to engage the class in history by mentioning how everyone's making history as they live. They stage a ‚Äúreenactment‚Äù of yesterday's breathing lesson incident, where this time Mr. Brainfright ends up falling out the window, much to Mrs. Cross‚Äô annoyance. Henry and his friends try to look for the treasure during lunch, but they failed. Henry correctly deduces that the book ‚ÄúOne Thousand Nights and a Night‚Äù might contain clues for the treasure's location, since the book was referenced in the poem. Going to the library, Jenny also correctly inferred another line referencing ‚ÄúThe Ruined Man Who Became Rich Again Through a Dream‚Äù means that Greenbeard's treasure is still buried at Skull Island, the hill on school property. Henry enlists Grant Gadget, an inventor, to lend him a metal detector, where they find a metal key to the chest. The next day, Jenny accidentally leaked to Fiona that they were finding treasure, which sets up a treasure hunting craze and pushes Henry and his friends off Skull Island. Fred and Clive encounter them, to which Henry admits the treasure exists but proceeds to give them a fake map the next day, deliberately falsifying the location as well to successfully lure everyone off Skull Island. Mr. Brainfright divulges his most unusual lesson yet: how to be friends with a banana. This leads to them skidding on banana peels, which leads to Mr. Brainfright accidentally bumping Mrs. Cross out the window. She reports to Mr. Greenbeard and he makes Mr. Brainfright behave and co-operate. Mr. Brainfright begins normal instruction by giving the class a spelling test. Here he reveals he was formerly an archeologist, much to Henry's delight when he asks for help finding the treasure. Mr. Brainfright conducts an archaeological dig with the whole class, and they finally find the treasure. Mrs Cross declares this the last straw and drags Mr. Brainfright to the office to get fired, but not before they free the treasure with his jackhammer. Henry is dismayed that Mr. Brainfright will be fired, but decides to use the treasure to convince Mr. Greenbeard to change his mind. They get the treasure out, but Fred steals it and opens it up with the key. All that is found is a marble, a rock, a pencil, a yo-yo, a shark's tooth, a rabbit's foot, a black-eye patch, a plastic ring, a water pistol, and a football card. Fred gets angry with Henry when he saw what was inside, and attempts to attack him. Instead, he trips over Newton's foot and falls into the hole where the treasure was found, giving time to grab it and race to Greenbeard's office. Greenbeard gets so happy that his items were found, and discovers the identity of the initials W.S. engraved in the chest as Wendy Smith, now Mrs. Cross. She reveals she was jealous that she wasn't allowed to play with Mr. Greenbeard pirates and stole the treasure out of retaliation. Mr. Greenbeard forgives her and gives Mr. Brainfight his job back. As a reward, Henry and his friends take one item each from the box, with Henry picking up a pencil with a skull on it. Meanwhile, even Fiona admires Mr. Brainfright's eccentricities, and he teaches the whole class how to fly.

It was founded in Barcelona in the winter of 1933, during the Second Spanish Republic. Many of their members came from Uni√≥n Aragonesista and had their origins in the north-east Aragonese region of Ribagorza. The president was Gaspar Torrente. The youth wing of the party, Los Almog√°vares ('The Almogavars'), headed by Luis Port√©, supported the declaration of the Catalan Republic by Lluis Companys in 1934, what lead to their headquarters being closed down. The organization was quite inactive until 1936, when they opened a new head office and Miguel Alcubierre was elected as the president of the youth wing. He started a campaign for self-government in Aragon which aroused the interest of the rest of left-wing Republican parties. Those actions led to a Congress taking place in Caspe (Saragossa) at the beginning of May in 1936, with Torrente as the chairman. The result was the draft of a Statute of Autonomy for Aragon, which would not come to the light due to the onset of the Spanish Civil War. By 1939 the party had ceased to exist. Renacimiento Aragon√©s ('Aragonese Revival') was the party's official publication. The party was in good relations with the Catalan party Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya.

The film stars James Shigeta, Glenn Corbett and Victoria Shaw.. It featured several ahead-of-its-time ideas about race and society's perception of race, a thematic and stylistic trademark of Fuller. The film is about two cops, friends and Korean War veterans, Detective Joe Kojaku (James Shigeta) and Detective Sgt. Charlie Bancroft (Glenn Corbett), who attempt to solve the murder of a local entertainer. A love triangle soon develops between the two detectives and a key witness, Christine Downes (Victoria Shaw). In the film the interracial relationships are compared to paintings using two different kinds of colors, a trope. Philip W. Chung of Asian Week wrote that the white woman choosing an Asian man as a romantic partner is \\"What was most revolutionary about the film in 1959 Hollywood\\", something that was, in 2007, \\"sadly, still revolutionary today.\\" Plot A stripper runs out onto a Los Angeles street in the Little Tokyo district, in a state of undress, mortally wounded by a gunshot. Police detectives Joe Kojaku and Charlie Bancroft, partners and bachelors who share an apartment, are assigned to the case. They find portraits of the stripper, known as Sugar Torch, dressed in a kimono as a geisha, apparently preparing a Japanese-themed act. The police search for a man who had been helping the stripper with her act. They interview a student artist, Christine Downes, who draws a sketch of the man for them, and Charlie develops a romantic attraction to her. They meet a man named Hansel who did the portrait of the dead woman; and a wigmaker, Roma, who provided the wig for the stage act. Joe worries for Christine's safety, that her sketch could result in the killer also pursuing her. He, too, begins to fall for Christine, and the interest is mutual. Charlie's facial reaction makes Joe believe that he resents the multi-racial nature of the relationship. Joe aggressively attacks Charlie during a martial-arts competition, then decides to quit the force, disillusioned after having felt for so long that his partner was free of this kind of racial bias. Charlie confronts Joe, telling him that the look he saw on his face was a flash of hatred for the envy and betrayal he felt towards Joe and his relationship with Christine, and was not racism. Joe doesn't believe him. An unknown assailant attempts to shoot Christine, and Joe and Charlie assume Hansel is the man behind the killings. It instead turns out to be Roma, who considered the stripper a threat to her relationship with Hansel because of a look that Hansel gave Sugar Torch. Joe relates this to Charlie, and realizes that just as Roma saw what she wanted in Hansel's face, Joe projected his own struggles with racism onto Charlie. After Roma's arrest, Joe asks Charlie if they can still be partners. He replies with a no, citing his bad feelings about Joe and Christine's relationship, but adding that he is, nevertheless, glad that Joe has \\"wrapped his own case\\". The movie ends with Joe and Christine embracing. Cast * James Shigeta as Detective Joe Kojaku * Glenn Corbett as Detective Sgt.

Harry Cohn, who was the executive leader of the production studio, approved the film although he earlier told Fuller his belief that average Americans were unlikely to be receptive to the film when Fuller proposed making the film. Preservation The Academy Film Archive preserved The Crimson Kimono in 1998. Reception The Crimson Kimono was met with critical acclaim. The film scored a perfect rating of 100% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 7 reviews. The staff at Variety magazine said of the film, \\"The mystery melodrama part of the film gets lost during the complicated romance, and the racial tolerance plea is cheapened by its inclusion in a film of otherwise straight action...The three principals bring credibility to their roles, not too easy during moments when belief is stretched considerably. Anna Lee, Paul Dubov, Jaclynne Green and Neyle Morrow are prominent in the supporting cast.\\" The critics of Time Out magazine wrote of \\"Fuller developing his theme of urban alienation: landscape, culture and sexual confusion are all juxtaposed, forcing the Japanese-born detective (who, along with his buddy, is on the hunt for a burlesque queen murderer) into a nightmare of isolation and jealousy. Some fine set pieces - like the disciplined Kendo fight that degenerates into sadistic anarchy - and thoughtful camera-work serve to illustrate Fuller's gift for weaving a poetic nihilism out of his journalistic vision of urban crime.\\" More recently, Ed Gonzales of Slant Magazine liked the film and wrote, \\"The opening is a triumph of grungy lyricism achieved through snaky cutting and blunt compositions: Sugar Torch (Gloria Pall), a stripper, is shot to death in the middle of a Los Angeles street after witnessing a murder inside her dressing room. The tenor of the film oscillates between tight-fisted noir and chamber drama, but the theme is always the same: cultural and romantic unrest. ... Fuller's feat is giving the film's nonstop interrogations, meetings and confrontations profound racial and political meaning.\\" The BFI Companion to Crime described the film as \\"One of Fuller's most striking melodramas\\". In the film Joe perceives his partner as being hostile to him which in a manner which Chung states is \\"portrayed as being largely self-created\\"; in response to this, Gina Marchetti argued in Romance and the \\"Yellow Peril\\", that the film therefore argues racism only exists \\"in the deluded minds of its victim.\\" See also * List of American films of 1959 References External links  The Crimson Kimono essay by Jeremy Arnold at Turner Classic Movies * 1959 films 1959 crime drama films American films Asian- American films American black-and-white films Columbia Pictures films English-language films Film noir Films directed by Samuel Fuller Films scored by Harry Sukman Films about interracial romance American crime drama films 1959 drama films ","title":"The Crimson Kimono"},{"id":"19164893","text":"Guaranteed Consumer Funding is a type of credit similar to layaway, which allows consumers to purchase items on a payment plan regardless of their credit history. This process requires signing a contract in which the consumer promises to make all of the payments in full by their due date. In return he will receive guaranteed credit and are allowed to use the product as he pays it off. With this type of loan the consumer does not receive his purchased items right away, as he would using traditional credit purchasing methods. Instead he is expected to make a predetermined number of timely payments as a show of good faith. If those requirements are met, the consumer may collect his purchased items and continue to make the payments until the contract has been fulfilled and the item has been paid off. However, the item will cost as much as four times the actual value of the item. There have been many complaints from people that they did not get the item, even after it was paid for in full. Due to the nature of the purchase and the terms of extended credit, generally these services do not have a cancellation or refund policy. However this information must be part of the signed contract in order to be enforced. Along with secured loans / credit and layaway programs, guaranteed consumer funding is a good way to help re-build bad credit and establish credit for those without. Many \\"Credit Repair\\" claims are scams. Seeing a payment contract to completion generally results in a positive report to the credit bureaus on your behalf. If a contract is signed for the guaranteed credit services, then the consumer is protected by the truth in lending act which requires lenders to fully disclose all terms of the agreement to potential customers. These terms include but are not limited to: duration of the loan, required payments & their due dates, cancellation / refund policy, availability of the merchandise, and total cost to the consumer.

He served in various cabinet roles from 2005 to 2020. Early life and exile Erkki Nghimtina was born in Eembidi in Ovamboland (now Ohangwena Region) in September 1948 to Meriam Shopati and Johannes Nghimtina. He began working in 1970 as a clerk in Oshakati and from 1972‚Äì73 in the postal services of South West Africa. Nghimtina went into exile with SWAPO in 1974 to Oshatotwa, Zambia. From Zambia, he left to the Soviet Union, where he trained as a military radio specialist until 1976. Returning to Zambia, Nghimtina became instructor and later supervisor for the eastern front of the Namibian War of Independence until 1979. From 1979‚Äì1982, the Eembidi native was the Director of Communications at Shilumbaba in Zambia while earning a diploma from the University of Rostock in the German Democratic Republic. From 1983‚Äì1989, he was the director of communications for the People's Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN) wing of SWAPO. Nghimtina returned to Namibia for the first time in 15 years in 1989. Military career Nghimtina entered the Namibia Defence Force with the rank of Colonel and was appointed as Assistant Director of Communications in the NDF and lasted in that post until retirement from active duty in 1995. While in the Namibian military, Nghimtina worked extensively with Southern African Development Community and African Union on regional and continental security measures. On Heroes' Day 2014 he was conferred the Most Brilliant Order of the Sun, Second Class. Political career Upon retirement from the military in 1995, Nghimtina entered politics. He was selected to the position of deputy Minister of Defence. In 1997, he was also selected to the SWAPO Central Committee. In 1997, Nghimtina was promoted to the Minister of Defence by president Sam Nujoma, a position he held until 2005. During this time, he was involved in leading the Namibian response to the 1999 Caprivi Succession movement. In an Amnesty International report, Nghimtina is quoted as acknowledging that security forces had made \\"made some mistakes regarding human rights abuses\\" in the handling of the situation. From 2005, he was appointed the Minister of Mines and Energy in President Hifikepunye Pohamba's cabinet. In this position, Nghimtina led Namibia's diamond industry to be restructured, which resulted in Namibian diamonds being cut and polished locally; also a state company, Epangelo Mining, to be established. In 2010, he was appointed to lead the Ministry of Works and Transport. In 2015, Nghimtina was appointed Namibia's Minister of Labour, Industrial Relations and Employment Creation under president Hage Geingob. He served until 2020 when he was not reappointed to cabinet. Political stances In 2001, while speaking in the Kavango Region as Minister of Defence, Nghimtina denounced and threatened Namibian collaborators with the Angolan rebel group UNITA while the Angolan Civil War was coming to a close. He said that the Military of Namibia would not allow people to die because collaborators were Namibians.Unita collaborators will be shot, says Nghimtina in The Namibian, 22 November 2001 Nghimtina consistently opposed the Iraq War, slamming it both immediately prior to and a year into it as a move by powerful nations to impose their will on weaker ones.Nghimtina slams US war efforts in The Namibian, 21 April 2004 2008 controversy In September 2008, Nghimtina was accused of aiming a firearm at a young relative and firing a shot in his direction. He allegedly did this because the teenager had joined the opposition Rally for Democracy and Progress (RDP). At a press conference held by RDP following the events, Jesaya Nyamu, acting secretary of the party, called it an attempted murder.\\"Nghimtina quits, Govt in denial\\", The Namibian, 3 September 2008. Following a press conference, President Hifikepunye Pohamba called Nghimtina into the State House to discuss the matter, which led to Nghimtina's forced resignation from both the National Assembly of Namibia and his ministerial position. However, following a meeting of high-level government and party officials including SWAPO secretary Pendukeni Iivula-Ithana, the minister was recalled to the State House and reprimanded, allowing him to retain his office. Shortly thereafter, Nghimtina was interrogated by Namibian police concerning the shooting. Infuriated by the interrogation, he resigned again. On 2 September, Nghimtina told The Namibian newspaper that he had not resigned and other party officials called his resignation just speculation. President Pohamba left for Zambia for the state funeral of President Levy Mwanawasa and was unable to immediately clear up the confusion. The next day, it was reported that Nghimtina had withdrawn his letter of resignation and returned to his post after prominent SWAPO leadership other than president Pohamba over-ruled Pohamba's dismissal.\\"Minister Nghimtina backtracks on resignation\\", The Namibian, 4 September 2008.

He was the father of Republican U.S. congressmen Phil and Dan Crane. Biography He was born on April 28, 1901 in Chicago, Illinois. In the 1930s, Crane developed and distributed many pamphlets concerning life, emotional health and marriage. One of them, \\"Tests for Husbands and Wives,\\"Reproduced in \\"Test Your Horse Sense\\", The Chicago Daily Tribune, January 1‚Äì12, 1940 remains a topic of discussion even into the 21st century.Monitor on Psychology, American Psychology Association, Volume 39, No. 5 May 2008, http://www.apa.org/monitor/2008/05/marriage.html http://audiblesmirk.wordpress.com/2008/05/23/tests-of-husbands-and- wives/http://www.boingboing.net/2008/05/13/1939-marital-rating.htmlFor the full pamphlet, see https://flickr.com/photos/tiabla/sets/72157605047200616/ This pamphlet contained evaluation charts for both husbands and wives, who could score themselves and others according to a 100-point scale. The tests were composite opinions of 600 husbands and wives, and included their most frequently voiced flaws and virtues. Crane summarized these opinions, and allocated points that reflected his \\"judgement as a psychologist and physician.\\" Tests for Husbands and Wives, George W. Crane, 1939. While many of the evaluations reflect lifestyles of the day, taking points off for wives with crooked stocking seams or wearing red nail polish, the pamphlet advocated a degree of sexual equality; the only twenty-pointer in the test was for the husband: \\"Ardent lover - sees his wife has orgasm in marital congress.\\" Ibid In 1957, he founded the Scientific Marriage Foundation, which claimed to have arranged over 5,000 marriages.Eleanor Harris, \\"Men Without Women,\\" Look, November 22, 1960, 124‚Äì30.

His articles consistently emphasized the use of logic in approaching life and solving problems. However, the logic presented in his columns was often unorthodox.

His father was a member of the New York City Fire Department who later died during a Mass celebrated by his son in 1948. Broderick received his early education at the parochial school of St. Anselm Church in the Bronx, graduating in 1930. He attended Regis High School in New York City from 1930 to 1934, and then began his studies for the priesthood at Cathedral College, where he remained for two years. He continued his studies at St. Joseph's Seminary in Yonkers. Priesthood On May 30, 1942, Broderick was ordained a priest by Cardinal Francis Spellman at St. Patrick's Cathedral. His first assignment was as a curate at Nativity of Our Blessed Lady Church in the Bronx. He then taught history at Cardinal Hayes High School from 1943 until 1947, when he was assigned to the staff of St. Patrick's Cathedral. In 1951, he earned a doctorate in English from Fordham University in 1951. That same year, he was named the first archdiocesan director of radio and television; during his tenure he created the Catholic Apostolate of Radio, TV and Advertising. He was made the U.S. representative to the Pontifical Commission for Television by Pope Pius XII in 1954. From 1954 to 1964, Broderick served as secretary to Cardinal Spellman.

He received his episcopal consecration on the following April 21 from Cardinal Spellman, with Bishops Terence Cooke and George Henry Guilfoyle serving as co-consecrators, at St. Patrick's Cathedral. At his consecration, he wore the same vestments used by Paul VI in his Mass at Yankee Stadium in October 1965. As an auxiliary bishop, he continued to serve as rector of St. Joseph's Seminary, a post which he held until 1969. Following the death of Bishop William Scully, Broderick was appointed the eighth Bishop of Albany on March 19, 1969. In 1970, he joined Governor Nelson Rockefeller in speaking out in favor of state aid to parochial schools. He served on the court-appointed Citizens' Committee that investigated the 1971 Attica Prison riot. Director of Catholic Relief Services On June 3, 1976, Broderick resigned as Bishop of Albany in order to assume the position of executive director of Catholic Relief Services. When he became head of CRS, he jokingly called the agency \\"the best kept secret in the American Catholic Church.\\" He increased awareness of CRS throughout the U.S. Catholic community; he sponsored short films, new publications, and three telethons that were hosted by such entertainers as Arthur Godfrey, Buddy Hackett, and Trini Lopez. He also established the agency's first direct mail appeal to donors. During his seven-year tenure, Broderick restructured the governance of CRS and increased the involvement of the laity in its operations. He also launched Operation Rice Bowl, one of the most successful programs in the agency's history. Under his guidance, CRS responded to numerous crises throughout the world, including the 1976 Angolan Civil War, the 1977 cyclone in India that left two million people homeless, the Cambodian genocide that lasted from 1975 to 1979, and civil war in Afghanistan and Lebanon. He resigned as executive director in 1983. Later life and death Broderick spent his retirement in Manhattan, and administered Confirmation in many parishes. In 2005, he moved to Teresian House in Albany, where he later died at age 89.

He is mostly remembered as the military chief that carried out the Santa Mar√≠a of Iquique School massacre in 1907, where more than 2,000 striking saltpeter miners, along with their wives and children, were killed. Early career Silva Renard began his military career in 1879, when he joined the artillery corps at the beginning of the War of the Pacific. During that war he fought at the battles of Tacna, Chorrillos and Miraflores After the war, Silva Renard was sent to study artillery in Europe, and served as an adjunct in the German Army for five years. During the 1891 Chilean Civil War, he was one of the few army officers to join the congressional army, with the rank of major, and fought with distinction at the battles of Conc√≥n and Placilla. After the war, he was rewarded with a promotion to lieutenant colonel. Political participation Silva Renard was a firm believer in the absolute power of the central government. In 1903, Silva Renard was the military attorney in charge of the investigation into the deaths and injuries of striking workers at the port of Valpara√≠so. These workers had been fired upon by army soldiers sent to force them back to work. He absolved the soldiers from any misconduct, claiming that the real guilty party had been the workers by promoting disorders. On September 17, 1904 he was in charge of the troops that put down another (unrelated) strike at the Chile nitrate works. As a consequence of his intervention, 13 workers died and another 32 were injured. Meat riots A march to protest against the high price of meat took place on October 22, 1905 in Santiago. By the time that the march arrived peacefully to La Moneda presidential palace, it had swelled to more than 40,000 people. The original intention of the organizers was to ask for an audience and hand a petition to president German Riesco, but the people started to grow impatient and when the President did not appear (he was not at the palace that day, being sick at home) this was the spark that started the violence. The police tried to disperse them, but they fought back and tried to storm the presidential palace. The police responded by shooting at the crowd, and riots ensued. After the mob failed in their initial attack, they spread through the city. The violence lasted for almost a week, in what was called the meat riots or the \\"red week\\". The rioters looted stores and businesses, killing anyone who looked upper class. The police was overwhelmed and quite powerless (and in some cases, even passively supporting the rioters.) The army was called in, but it was away from the city, on military maneuvers. It only managed to arrive on October 24, under the command of Lt. Colonel Silva Renard, who immediately imposed martial law upon the city. The riots lasted until October 27, and between 200 and 250 people were killed over this period, while more than 500 were injured while the financial losses were staggering. Santa Mar√≠a of Iquique School massacre right On December 10, 1907, a general strike broke out in Tarapac√° Province. This was the start of the 18 Pence Strike (), the name referring to the size of the wage being demanded by the nitrate miners. On December 16, thousands of striking workers arrived at the provincial capital, the port city of Iquique, in support of the nitrate miners' demands and with the aim of prodding the authorities to act. Previous entreaties to the government, in particular petitions presented by delegations in 1901, 1903, and 1904, had been fruitless. The national government in Santiago sent extra regiments by land and sea to reinforce the two regiments stationed in Iquique. President Pedro Montt appointed General Silva Renard to handle the situation. Silva Renard, under confidential orders from the minister of the Interior, Rafael Sotomayor, was ordered to use all necessary means to force the miners to dissolve and return to work. More and more worker contingents joined the strike by the day. It has been estimated that by December 21 the strikers in Iquique numbered ten to twelve thousand. Soon after the journeys to Iquique began, this great conglomeration of workers met at the Manuel Montt plaza and at the Santa Mar√≠a School, asking the government to mediate between them and the bosses of the foreign (English) nitrate firms to resolve their demands. For their part, the bosses refused to negotiate until the workers went back to work. The arrival at the port December 19 of the titular intendant, Carlos Eastman Quiroga, of General Silva Renard, chief of the First Military Zone of the Chilean Army, and of Colonel Sinforoso Ledesma was cheered by the workers because a nitrate miners' petition to the government nearly two years earlier, under the previous president, had received an encouraging response, although the demands had not been satisfied.Dev√©s, Eduardo, Los que van a morir te saludan, Chile, 1985 But the interior ministry felt no solidarity with the demands of the strikers. The ministry relayed orders to the strikers to leave the plaza and the school and gather at the horse racing track, where they were to board trains and return to work. They refused, sensing that if they went back to work, their requests would be ignored. In the face of the growing tension between the groups, on December 20, 1907 the strikers' representatives held a meeting with Intendant Eastman. Simultaneously, a decree published in the press announced the declaration of a state of siege, which entailed the suspension of constitutional rights. While the meeting with Intendant Eastman was taking place in the \\"Buenaventura nitrate works\\", a group of workers and their families tried to leave the spot, but troops opened fire on them by the railroad tracks and kept shooting. As a result, six workers died and the rest of the group was wounded.Dev√©s, Eduardo, Los que van a morir te saludan, Chile, 1985 The Santa Mar√≠a school, circa 1907 The funerals of the slain workers were held the next day, December 21, 1907. Immediately at their conclusion, all workers were ordered to leave the school premises and vicinity and relocate to the Club H√≠pico (horsetrack). The workers refused to go, fearing they might be bombarded by the guns of warships which were lined up alongside the road they would have to travel. At 2:30 in the afternoon, General Silva Renard told the leaders of the workers' committee that if the strikers did not start heading back to work within one hour, the troops would open fire on them. The workers' leaders refused to go, and only a small group of strikers left the plaza. At the hour indicated by Silva Renard, he ordered the soldiers to shoot the workers' leaders, who were on the school's roof, and they fell dead with the first volley. El√≠as Lafferte, who witnessed the events, tells: The multitude, desperate and trying to escape, surged toward the soldiers, and were fired upon with rifles and machine guns. After a period of firing from the Manuel Montt plaza, the troops stormed the school grounds with machine guns, firing into the school's playgrounds and classrooms, killing in a frenzy without regard to the women and children screaming for mercy. The survivors of the massacre were brought at saber point to the Club H√≠pico, whence they were sent back to work, where they were subjected to a reign of terror. Assassination attempt Among the dead at the Santa Mar√≠a massacre was Manuel Vaca, a Spanish immigrant worker. His half-brother, Antonio Ram√≥n arrived in Chile from ArgentinaGoicovic Donoso, Igor, Entre el dolor y la ira: La venganza de Antonio Ram√≥n Ram√≥n, Editorial Universidad de Los Lagos, Osorno, Chile, 2005, pp. 188 decided to seek revenge. Ram√≥n finally took action seven years later and bought a dagger and some strychnine. He found General Silva Renard walking alone to his office, on December 14, 1914, and stabbed him seven times on his back and head. The General started shouting ‚ÄúMurderer! Murderer!‚Äù and several passersby came to his help. Ram√≥n, in turn, stopped the attack and tried to run away, only to be captured by an off-duty prison guard. When Ram√≥n saw himself surrounded and all escapes blocked, he drank the bottle of strychnine he was carrying, but vomited most of it and was unharmed. Once in custody, Ram√≥n vehemently denied other parties' involvement in the assassination, while the worker's organizations held public campaigns to raise money for his defense. He was eventually sentenced to five years in prison. Aftermath General Silva Renard survived the attack, but suffered permanent effects from the injuries: he lost all movement on half of his face, became blind, and was mostly an invalid until his death in 1920. Ram√≥n was released in 1919 and all track of him was lost after that time. Silva Renard lived his last days in Vi√±a del Mar where he died in 1920. His remains were buried with full honors at the General Cemetery of Santiago. He was honored post-mortem by giving his name to the Artillery Regiment N¬∫ 3 stationed in Concepci√≥n. In 2007, his name was removed as part of the 100th anniversary remembrance events of the Santa Mar√≠a School massacres.

The screenplay by Eric Ambler was based on the 1956 novel of the same name by Hammond Innes. Plot The steamship Mary Deare, out of Hong Kong, is found adrift at sea in a storm in the English Channel by salvager John Sands. Sands boards it hoping to claim it for salvage, but finds Gideon Patch, former first officer who has been captain for four days since the death of Taggart, the previous captain, still aboard and trying to run the ship on his own. Patch gives Sands mysterious hints about two fires, a dynamite incident and having been hit on the head and left on the ship when the crew abandoned it four days before. He refuses to let the ship be claimed for salvage, and insists on running it onto rocks in the dangerous region of the Minquiers, so that it will stay above water until an official inspection by a board of inquiry in England. Sands tries to get back to his own ship, the Sea Witch, and cannot because of the storm; Patch saves his life by pulling him back onto the Mary Deare. Sands reluctantly joins him in running the ship, with much effort in the flooded engine room, onto a reef in the Minquiers. When the two reach land, Sands learns that the survivors among the crew, led by second officer Higgins, are claiming that Patch gave an unnecessary order to abandon ship. A boat containing the officers who were not allies of Higgins was lost, and they are claiming Patch was responsible for the deaths of those men. The owner of the ship, the insurance company and the salvage company put pressure on Patch and Sands, who remains Patch's ally, but Patch insists on a board of inquiry. He visits Captain Taggart's daughter Janet, who lets him borrow a page of a letter from her father that mentions being anchored for days beside another ship in the harbour at Rangoon. Patch's story gradually emerges: Higgins and his allies were in a conspiracy with the ship owners in which they offloaded their most important cargo, high-quality American-made airplane engines being sent home from the Korean War, to the other ship at Rangoon, possibly to sell them to the Communist Chinese. Then they destroyed the ship's communications, blew a hole in its side with dynamite and fired the engine room to sink the ship slowly while they got away, destroying the evidence that the engines were no longer on board. They took advantage of the fact that Captain Taggart was an alcoholic having a breakdown. Patch finally gets his board of inquiry, but it goes badly for him: the lawyer for the owners presents Higgins' story as the credible record of events, and Patch's credibility is damaged when he has to admit that he accidentally killed Captain Taggart while trying to control him in a fit of delirium. The judges do not allow Patch to read his version of events into the record. The lawyer then announces that the Mary Deare has been found by a survey from the air, and a French salvage crew is now working to refloat it and take it to shore. Janet, who suspects the owner's party, tells Patch that Higgins will be on board when the ship floats, and Patch realizes that in its weakened condition it will be easy for one man to sink it in deep water, so that it will never be known that the engines are missing. Patch steals Sands' salvage boat to get to the Mary Deare and prevent this; Sands, after catching him fueling the boat, joins him. They don diving suits and get into the ship underwater through the dynamite hole, and they indeed find that the engine boxes are filled with rocks and not engines. Higgins has seen Patch's and Sands' underwater lights as they entered through the hole. Higgins then traps them in the flooded hold by locking the hatch they entered through and waits at the only other exit from the flooded decks with a harpoon. His two friends are reluctant to actually kill, but Higgins wounds Sands with the harpoon. Patch and Sands fool him into striking at emptiness with lights on a pole, pull him into the water and subdue him. When they emerge, Higgins' friends abandon the murderous plot, and the French salvagers call the authorities. Patch is vindicated, and says to Sands that the only thing he wants is another ship to command.

Hitchcock had long wanted to work with Cooper, but after developing the script with Ernest Lehman for several weeks, they concluded that it could not be done without turning the film into \\"a boring courtroom drama\\". They abandoned the idea and started a new story which eventually became North by Northwest.Patrick McGilligan, Alfred Hitchcock: A Life in Darkness and Light (New York: HarperCollins, 2003), pg. 543, 548-549 The task of adapting the novel passed to Eric Ambler. British director Michael Anderson took over for Hitchcock. The cast included Cooper as Patch, and Charlton Heston as Sands, with Richard Harris and Sir Michael Redgrave in supporting roles. Critics generally agree that the finished film matches Hitchcock and Lehman's prediction.Glenn Erickson's review of The Wreck of Mary Deare DVD DVD Journal review of The Wreck of the Mary Deare There were long delays in filming due to Gary Cooper's ill health, although he was not diagnosed with cancer until the spring of 1960.

Plot Fishing season has begun and park ranger J. Audubon Woodlore goes out on the lake to check on the anglers. Humphrey the Bear is trying to catch some fish, but cannot seem to hold onto one once he catches it. Woodlore sees the fish disappearing before his eyes, so he decides to stock the lake with some more. As he heads to the fish hatchery, he sees Humphrey with a few fishing nets and rods, and asks him what he is doing. When the bear tells him that he is going to catch some fish, Woodlore takes the rods and nets and tells him to \\"Go fish like a bear!\\" At the hatchery, Woodlore selects an envelope of fish eggs from a collection of eggs. He fills a tub with water and inserts the eggs into it. In a matter of seconds, several fishes pop up out of the water like plants out of soil. When the ranger gets to the lake to dump the fish, he finds Humphrey in there, trying to eat one of the small fishes, which is then consumed by a much larger fish. Humphrey manages to remove the small fish from the mouth of the large fish, and then uses it to lure five other large fishes that jump out of the water, but then Woodlore appears to measure the fish, while at the same time punishing Humphrey by hitting him on the head, causing him to sink into the depths of the lake. When Humphrey grabs some more fish and emerges from the lake, he discovers a fish larger than any of the others; this turns out to be a fish balloon with which a young boy is playing. Humphrey pops the balloon, and both the boy and Woodlore kick the bear in the knee. Humphrey then tries to think of another way to foil the anglers; noticing the boy from before walking along the lake with a toy boat, he removes the bottom from the boat, ties it onto his head like a hat, and then submerges himself into the lake so that the hat looks like a shark's dorsal fin to the anglers, causing them to flee in terror. Humphrey then takes all of the anglers' bags of fish, but upon seeing the ranger, he loads the fish into Woodlore's helicopter, giving him more of a full load than he was expecting. He then decides to stuff himself into the plane, which proves to be too small for him and the fish, and then all of the fish in the helicopter, along with Humphrey, are deposited into the lake.

It was the first of three public parks to be opened on 22 August 1846, for the people of Manchester and Salford, paid for by public subscription. The park was the main public venue for the 1851 royal visit of Queen Victoria to Manchester and Salford and has been the subject of a number of paintings by the Salford artist, L.S. Lowry. Peel Park fell into disrepair during the latter part of the twentieth century but underwent a ¬£1.6m refurbishment in 2017 after a successful bid to the Heritage Lottery Fund.http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester- news/salfords-historic-peel-park---9542477  History  Early 19th-century reformers had become concerned about the consequences of enclosure and thought that public walks and gardens were the solution. Richard Walker, the Member of Parliament for Bury had spoken in Parliament about the lack of areas for recreation in his home town and in 1833 the Select Committee on Public Walks was set up to look at the problem. The committee noted that, owing to urban development and rising property values during the previous fifty years, \\"many inclosures of open spaces in the vicinity of Towns had taken place, and little or no provision had been made for Public Walks or Open Spaces, fitted to afford means of exercise or amusement to the middle or humbler classes\\". They gathered witnesses from dozen or so of the large manufacturing towns to try to establish remedies. One of their conclusions was that \\"having a place to which they (the humbler classes) might resort on a Sunday Evening would tend to promote that self-respect which is so advantageous to all classes\\". Although there were a number of parks in the UK, most of them were royal parks or privately owned estates, and the landowners could exclude those they did not approve of, as is illustrated by the following letter published in The Times on 10 July 1846: > TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir, I wish. that you would let your readers > understand that Hyde park and St. James's Park are not public parks. > Victoria park and the suburban parks are intended for the public ‚Äî the > former parks for the aristocracy. St. James's park has for some time been > very exclusive, and now Hyde-park imitates its neighbour. Last Wednesday > every decently dressed mechanic was turned out of Hyde-park. The warden in > green said this was in accordance, with new orders received from the Ranger. > It strikes me that these very green, underlings are acting in a way, whether > with or without authority, most conducive to encourage revolutionary > Principles, and I expect some day to hear of their getting a good ducking in > the Serpentine. What is the use of this excessive exclusiveness with regard > to parks which used to be considered public?, It is enough to make any > person's blood boil to see a well-dressed mechanic refused admission into a > park considered public. I wish, Sir, you would either enlighten me on the > subject or attempt some improvement of the aristocratic notions of the men > in green. Their behaviour proves that no one is so exclusive as one of the > lower classes when placed in authority. I am, Sir, Your obedient servant, C. > D. Hyde-park-square, July 9. The most prominent supporters of the campaign in the north of England were Liberal MP for Manchester Mark Philips, and the then Prime Minister, Sir Robert Peel. After seven years of campaigning, Manchester set up the Committee for Public Walks, Gardens & Playgrounds. Large sums of money were contributed to the fund by both these men and also by the local workers. In a letter to the Manchester Guardian, published in The Times on 31 October 1844, the writer said; > Scarcely a week passes without bringing its own new and striking testimony > to the deep interest felt in the Promotion of this great object by all > classes of the community. From the Premier of England to the humblest > operative ... We have already mentioned several instances in the course of > the subscription which show that the clerks salesmen, warehousemen, and even > the packers and porters in the warehouses are as heartily disposed to > promote the success of this object as any other class of the community; and > they have proved themselves as liberal, in proportion to their means, as > their employers themselves. We are tempted, even in anticipation of the > usual weekly advertisement of the sums received since the amount last > advertised, to mention the most recent instance of this class which has > contributed to swell the aggregate amount of the fund by no inconsiderable > sum.

A design competition was held for the three parks ‚Äî Queen's Park and Philips Park, in Manchester, and Peel Park in Salford. Each park was required to have playgrounds, including provision for archery and quoits, together with skittle and ball alleys, a refreshment room, one or more fountains, and retiring places. The competition was won by Joshua Major and Son of Knowsthorp, near Leeds, and the parks were laid out under that firm's supervision in 1845-46, by the company of Pim and Richardson, Nurserymen, of Higher Ardwick. The three parks were all opened, with great ceremony, on 22 August 1846, Peel Park on the Lark Hill Estate being the first to be opened \\"for the enjoyment and recreation of the public\\" followed by Queen's Park in Harpurhey and Philips Park in Bradford, Manchester.

The collection included depictions of Queen Victoria, Albert, Prince Consort, Joseph Brotherton MP,Brotherton was a very popular MP for 24 years, a campaigner against child labour and one of the founders of the Manchester Chamber of Commerce and Richard Cobden MP. The statue of Queen Victoria was erected in front of the Salford Museum and Art Gallery in 1857, to commemorate the royal visit of 1851 to Manchester and Salford, when she was welcomed by a crowd of eighty thousand people in the park. The statue was unveiled by the Queen on her second visit in 1857 by which time a stone arch decorated in the Indian style, the Victoria Arch (pictured), had been erected in her honour at the entrance to the park.

Three men were drowned and many others, including the keeper of the park, had to be rescued from the upper storeys of their homes.

Mrs Baring has further problems when tickets for her Spolenski concerts sell badly, and he threatens to leave for home unless she is able to put up ¬£3,000. Once again Burns secretly steps in, securing the money as an advance from Greenslades. After learning of Burns' fame, Joanna goes to his concert. When her mother discovers this, she grows furious and confronts both of them firing Burns and forbidding her daughter from seeing him again. In his anger, he calls her a \\"square\\". Their rift is not helped by his next song, \\"The Lady is a Square\\" which appears to be directly mocking her. However, she relents when she discovers that he has secretly been paying her bills and that he is trying to abandon a concert of his, which is scheduled at the same time as her Spolenski concert, in a bid to help her ticket sales. Spolenski then falls ill, which turns out to be a blessing as it will mean they will be able to re-launch the tour with financial assistance from Greenslade. Baring and her daughter attend Burns' concert where to their surprise he performs Handel‚Äôs Ombra mai fu with the National Youth Orchestra, to wild applause from his fans. Ultimately they are able to agree on the co-existence of popular and classical music and Mrs Baring ends the film dancing to one of Burns‚Äô songs.

While his doctors are waiting for his injury to heal before proceeding, Adams is driven off the base to a party but is dropped off at the wrong address. Entering the house, he stumbles over a body and startles the killers Rushford (Ronan O'Casey) and Schrieder (George Pastell). Realising Adams is blind, they knock him out and throw him down a flight of stairs. When Adams revives back in the same hospital, his tale of murder seems implausible, as no evidence of a crime is found. After regaining his eyesight, Adams finds himself framed on a diamond-smuggling charge. He sets out to track down the real thieves, pretending that he is still blind in order to catch them off guard. Encountering an aircraft mechanic (Gordon Jackson) and the Brent family, with father (John Le Mesurier) and sister (Delphi Lawrence), Adams realises that a pilot thought to be dead is really Johnny Brent (Michael Caine) who knows more about the theft and murders. Finally unravelling the mysterious death and smuggling operation, Adams proves his innocence.

D. Hurst\\", or \\"Lincoln D. Hurst\\", was an American scholar of the Bible, religious history and film. He was Emeritus Professor at the University of California, Davis (1983‚Äì2006), and Adjunct Professor at Fuller Theological Seminary, Pasadena, California (1987‚Äì2008). Lincoln Hurst (1946-2008) American biblical scholar and film historian Life and career Born in Chicago and raised in Arlington Heights, Illinois, Hurst graduated from Arlington High School, and later received the Bachelor of Arts degree in History from Trinity College (now Trinity International University), Deerfield, Illinois (1969). He was then granted the Master of Divinity (1973) and Master of Theology (1976) degrees from Princeton Theological Seminary (where he worked under the late Bruce M. Metzger) and the Doctor of Philosophy (1982) degree from Oxford University (Mansfield College), England, where he worked under the late G. B. Caird. Anglican Bishop N.T. Wright also did his doctoral work under Caird, and three years after Caird's death Hurst and Wright co-edited a volume in his memory. Hurst also acted as Caird's family- appointed literary executor, insofar as some of Caird's work was left hanging in mid-air when he died. Before taking up a post at the University of California, Davis in 1983, he was an Instructor at Bloomfield College, New Jersey (1973‚Äì74), Lecturer (1979‚Äì80) and Junior Dean (1980‚Äì81) at Mansfield College, Oxford, and Visiting Fellow at Princeton Theological Seminary (Fall, 1982). He was a lifelong proponent of Animal welfare. Committed to preserving the memories of G. B. Caird and Errol Flynn, he spent the final weeks of his life writing about the historic achievements of both men. Hurst died suddenly from a heart attack in November 2008. Areas of Activity Biblical studies Having written extensively on the Epistle to the Hebrews, Hurst's work has also focused on a variety of other topics, including ethics in religion, the Aramaic language of the Gospels and Acts, the Dead Sea scrolls, the development of early Christian thought about Jesus, New Testament Theology, and the relationship of religion and film. His work has shown a maverick tendency, with a willingness to take up unpopular positions that go against the mainstream. His discussion of Hebrews (Hurst 1990) accordingly is unconcerned about the identity of the unknown author - a common preoccupation - but is rather directed at uncovering the particular religious milieu out of which he or she came. He is insistent that the author was not a disciple of either Plato or Philo, or that he was a former member of the Qumran community - prevailing views for much of the twentieth century. The writer instead was a mainstream first century Christian who was heavily influenced by Paul the Apostle and the Jewish Apocalyptic tradition. He also maintains, against virtually all scholars and commentators, that the first chapter of Hebrews is designed to illustrate not the deity of Christ, but his perfect humanity. The first-century writer wishes his readers to know that in Jesus God has restored the human race to its proper predestined place \\"above the angels\\" (Psalm 8:4-6; Hurst 1987). His interest in the question of the Historical Jesus led him to question the linguistic techniques by which the majority of scholars have attempted to reconstruct Jesus's original Aramaic words beneath the later Greek gospels (Hurst 1986). The ethical dimensions of Jesus's teaching is another area into which he has delved; he considers Jesus's ethics to be indissolubly linked to Realized eschatology - the idea (associated with C. H. Dodd) that for Jesus the Kingdom of God had already, in substantial form, arrived in the teaching, life, and death of Jesus (Hurst 1992). A central facet of Christian doctrine since the early centuries of the church has been the Pre-existence of Christ, and this is another area that has attracted his attention. Hurst (r.) with the late G. B. Caird, Oxford, November, 1982. His claim (following G. B. Caird) that Paul the Apostle represents both the earliest and the highest thinking about Jesus in the New Testament (as opposed, for instance, to the Gospel of John) runs counter to the view of the majority of scholars, and in this case he has had a notable disagreement with University of Durham theology Professor James Dunn (Hurst, 1986); he and Dunn have appeared in the same volume \\"discussing\\" the question (Martin and Dodd, 1998). Hurst's interest in the subject of New Testament Theology, sparked by his posthumous completion of G. B. Caird's work of that title, remains a continuing thrust of his research. The messianism of the Dead Sea scrolls has been one of the most widely discussed topics of the past sixty years in western religious circles; here it has been almost a dogma among scholars that the members of the Qumran community were idiosyncratic in that they expected not one, but two Messiahs. Hurst has stood against this idea, claiming that the members of the desert sect held to a thoroughly orthodox Jewish belief in one Messiah (Hurst 1999) (there is little, if any, evidence that his arguments in this regard have made even a negligible impact on the field). He is also concerned to explore the influence of Christianity in general, and the Bible in particular, on the films of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries - especially those that use the Bible symbolically in \\"modern\\" settings (Hurst 2004). Film History In addition to studies in religion and the Bible, Hurst has maintained a long interest in the history of film. For most of his life he studied cinema as an avocation, but in his later years it consumed an increasing amount of his time. For approximately ten years he taught a popular course on film at the University of California, Davis, where his work tended to center on the relationship of film and music and of film and religion. He was an accredited film historian, having appeared in many documentary features (on DVD and television, including Britain (the BBC) and Australia (the ABC)) dealing with various aspects of some of the most significant films in American cinematic history. He displayed a special fondness for crime films, having publicly commented on three of what he considered (in addition to The Godfather trilogy) to be among the most historically crucial: Angels with Dirty Faces, The Roaring Twenties and (most significantly) White Heat. He is seen notably in features accompanying the Warner Brothers DVD releases of the classic 1941 release of \\"The Maltese Falcon\\", and in various 'signature collection' DVDs, including those of Humphrey Bogart and Errol Flynn, featuring on the commentaries alongside Martin Scorsese, Eric Lax, Michael Madsen, and Theresa Russell, among others. In 2005 he recorded the full-length audio commentary for the Warner Home Video DVD release of the 1939 classic James Cagney crime film, The Roaring Twenties, included in \\"The Warner Gangsters Collection\\".

The No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) reauthorized 21st CCLC in 2002, transferring the administration of the grants from the U.S. Department of Education to the state education agencies. Each state receives funds based on its share of Title I funding for low-income students. Funds are also allotted to outlying areas and the Bureau of Indian Affairs.The No Child Left Behind Act narrowed the focus of 21st CCLC from a community learning center model, where all members of the community benefited from access to school resources such as teachers, computer labs, gymnasiums and classrooms, to an afterschool program model that provides services only to students attending high-poverty, low- performing schools. The services they provide include Academic enrichment activities that can help students meet state and local achievement standards. They also provide additional services designed to reinforce and complement the regular academic program, such as: drug and violence prevention programs, counseling programs, art, music, and recreation programs, technology education programs, and character education programs. Programs also may provide literacy and related educational development services to the families of children who are served in the program. http://www.ed.gov/programs/21stcclc/index.html Mission and goals The mission of 21st Century Community Learning Centers is to promote student achievement and prepare students to compete on a global scale. Specifically, the program targets high-poverty and low-performing schools that may need extra support. The program has three main goals: 1\\\\. To help students achieve standards in core academic subjects, such as reading and math 2\\\\. To offer enrichment programs that supplement regular academic programs 3\\\\. To provide educational services for the families of participating students The following sections explain more about how 21st Century achieves these goals. History After school programs were developed in the early 1900s. As neighborhoods became more dangerous and more mothers entered the workforce, parents searched for safe places for their children to go after school. Schools responded to these changes by creating programs in which students could stay after school to receive help with their homework or to participate in other activities. In 1994, The U.S. Congress created 21st Century Community Learning Centers through the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. Originally, all community members were welcome to use these centers, not just students. In other words, any member of the community could go to participating schools and take 21st Century classes after the regular school hours. The original bill (Text H.R.6. - 103rd Congress) states the following: \\"21st Century Community Learning Centers enable the entire community to develop an education strategy that addresses the educational needs of all members of local communities.\\" Congress distributed the first grants for community learning centers in 1998. Originally, grants lasted three years. Most centers held only academic programs, although a few held recreational programs as well. The early budget was about $40 million. In 2001, The U.S. Congress expanded the 21st Century program through the No Child Left Behind Act. Through NCLB, Congress increased the funding for the 21st Century program from $40 million to $1 billion. With NCLB, Congress also changed how 21st Century grants were distributed. Rather than give money directly to schools, the program began distributing funds to states. The amount of money allocated to each state is now based on the percentage of schools within a state that qualify as Title I schools (schools where at least 40 percent of the students are from families living below the poverty line). The states then determine how the funds are distributed to schools. Organizational structure The 21st Century program is implemented at many different levels. Implementation begins at the federal level. It then moves down to the state level, and it is finally distributed on the front lines at the local level to eligible entities. Federal structure The Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) describes the purposes and procedures of the 21st Century program. State and local levels of government also function within the boundaries and procedures provided by the ESEA. The U.S. Congress gives all of the money allocated to the 21st Century program to the U.S. Department of Education (USDE). The USDE distributes the appropriated money to a state only when two requirements have been met: (1) the state applies for the grant money, and (2) the USDE finds that the state will use the money in accordance with ESEA requirements. Qualifying states are allocated an amount of money determined by the ESEA. State structure Once the states receive money from the USDE, they distribute the money to eligible local entities that meet the requirements. These entities could be any local organization that meets the ESEA eligibility requirements, including school districts. States distribute money to entities in three- to five-year grants. This is done after (1) an entity has applied for a grant, (2) the state finds that the entity is eligible to receive a grant, and (3) the state finds that the entity will use the money in accordance with ESEA standards. The ESEA requires applicants to meet two major criteria: (1) entities must use the money only on services prescribed by the ESEA, and (2) these entities must periodically evaluate the progress of the grant-funded programs. Also, all entities should use the results of the evaluations to improve their programs, and they must make the results publicly available. Local structure Entities that receive these grants are estimated to serve a total of 1.7 million students across the country each year. Furthermore, these programs likely serve hundreds of thousands of adults. Grant-receiving organizations may also be supported by non-governmental organizations. For example, some communities may collaborate with organizations such as Girl Scouts of the USA, Boy Scouts of America, Gear Up, Teens Act, and ESOL Adult Program. Budget On average, Congress appropriated about $1.9 billion annually to the program between 2002 and 2007. Since 2007, Congress has determined yearly how much money will be appropriated to the program. However, the congressional record does not explain how Congress determines the amount appropriated each year. Congressional records indicate that in 2015 Congress will appropriate $3.5 billion in grants to local education agencies. However, this number includes all programs that provide grants to local educational agencies, not just 21st Century. This money will be distributed to qualifying states that apply and then on to eligible local entities.

It binds to the Œ±1, Œ±2, Œ±3 and Œ±5 subtypes, but shows much higher efficacy at the Œ±5 subtype, and acts either as a weak partial agonist or inverse agonist at the other subtypes, with its partial agonist effect at Œ±2 likely to be responsible for the lack of anxiety produced by this drug when compared to older Œ±5-preferring inverse agonists such as L-655,708. The Œ±5 subtype is expressed predominantly in the hippocampus, an area of the brain involved with learning and memory, and activation of this subtype is thought to be largely responsible for producing the cognitive side effects displayed by many benzodiazepine and nonbenzodiazepine drugs, such as amnesia and difficulties with learning and memory. This led researchers to conclude that a drug acting as an inverse agonist at this subtype should have the opposite effect and enhance learning and memory. Older non-selective inverse agonists at the benzodiazepine site such as DMCM are associated with a range of other effects including anxiety and convulsions, but because Œ±5IA acts specifically at the Œ±5 subtype it produces nootropic effects in animal studies, yet without any significant anxiogenic or pro-convulsant effects. This gives Œ±5IA the potential to be a useful drug either to be used alongside benzodiazepines to counteract their cognitive side effects, or by itself as a nootropic with possible applications in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia.

The film depicts a fictionalised account of the escape of Charles II, arranged by a foppish royalist nobleman, the Earl of Dawlish, who leads a double life as a roundhead-baiting highwayman called The Moonraker, who already has helped more than thirty royalists to escape to France.THE MOONRAKER Picture Show; London Vol. 71, Iss. 1845, (Aug 9, 1958): 9 The film was one of the last productions made by the Robert Clarke regime at Associated British-Pathe. Synopsis After the Battle of Worcester at the end of the Second English Civil War, the main aim of General Oliver Cromwell (John Le Mesurier) is to capture Charles Stuart (Gary Raymond), son of the executed Charles I. However, the dashing Royalist hero nicknamed The Moonraker (George Baker) prepares to smuggle him to safety in France, under the noses of Cromwell's soldiers. According to the story, the hero is named after the smuggler term, Moonrakers, who were reputed to hide contraband in the village pond and to rake it out by moonlight.

The play debuted in 1952, starring Griffith Jones and Jean Kent. The Manchester Guardian called it \\"a disarming and naive piece... of dramatic tushery.\\"\\"THE MOONRAKER\\" Hope-Wallace, Philip. The Manchester Guardian 9 May 1952: 5. In February 1952 Robert Clark of Associated British proposed that his company purchase the film rights as a vehicle for Audrey Hepburn, who they had under contract, and either David Niven or Cornel Wilde. Associated British had an arrangement with Warner Bros; Jack Warner liked the story and agreed to a co production starring Hepburn and Wilde.Porter p 12 The play had been very successful in the provinces, so Watkyn wanted ¬£10,000 for the film rights; neither Clark nor Warner would pay this, so Watkyn refused to sell until the play opened in London. When it did, it was a box office disaster and only lasted four performances. Watkyn agreed to sell the rights. However the film was not made with Hepburn.Porter p 12 The film was eventually made several years later. It was one of the last film Clark green-lit while head of the company and he is credited as \\"director of production\\".Porter p 20 According to one writer, \\"rhis was an unusual occurrence for Clark, and indicates his intense interest in the project. And indeed The Moonraker should be interpreted as Clark‚Äôs ‚Äòlast stand‚Äô on politics and film culture. Rather than display a preference for the attractive and swashbucking Cavaliers (as is so often evident in British popular culture), Clark's film takes care to establish the moral superiority of the Roundheads. Its soldiery are on the whole presented as moral men convinced of the probity of their cause, and Cromwell (John Le Mesurier) is a dignified and balanced leader. Clark clearly favoured an interpretation of history which presented Puritanism as more sober and even-handed than its alternative.\\"Harper, S., & Porter, V. (2003).

Located geographically near the center of the city, Old Southwest was annexed from Roanoke County in 1890 and developed as one of Roanoke's more affluent residential areas. Today the majority of the neighborhood falls within the Southwest Historic District listed on both the Virginia Landmarks Register and the National Register of Historic Places. Location Geographically, Old Southwest is defined by the city as the area bound by Jefferson Street (Virginia State Route 116) on the east, 10th Street to the west, the Norfolk and Western railroad tracks to the south and both Day and Marshall Avenue to the north. It borders the neighborhoods of the Mountain View on the west, Wasena on the south and west, South Jefferson on the south and east, Downtown on the north and east and West End on the north. History Annexed from Roanoke County in 1890, the area now defined as Old Southwest was developed primarily between the years 1882 and 1930, to the southwest of Downtown Roanoke. The neighborhood is predominantly residential with commercial generally concentrated along and east of Franklin Road. The neighborhood features a variety of architectural styles including but not limited to Queen Anne, Colonial Revival, Neoclassical, Bungalow, American Foursquare, Arts and Crafts and Shingle, in addition to Roanoke's first public park, Highland Park, opened in 1901. Old Southwest would grow to become one of Roanoke's premier residential areas from its initial establishment through the years following World War Two when it would see the beginnings of a decline. By the 1970s, the neighborhood would begin to see a turnaround and the subsequent establishment of the Southwest Historic District in 1985.

Archaeology A team of archaeologists, led by Dmitry Vasilyev of Astrakhan State University, had been excavating for nine years. According to Vasilyev, they found the remains of an ancient brick fortress in the newly found 9th and 10th century layers, which contained characteristic Khazar yurts. The investigated area covered more than 2 square kilometers. \\"This is a hugely important discovery ...

As reported by Norman Finkelshteyn, it was \\"a city bisected by riverbeds with a central island citadel of fired brick\\".

The fortress at Samosdelka had a triangular shape was made from limestone bricks. It is known from written sources that the Khazar khagan had a monopoly on brick buildings. Traces of a widespread fire were found at Samosdelka in an Atil layer. The fire was probably set during the conquest of Atil by Kievan Rus' prince Sviatoslav I in 968 or 969 CE.

Under the coaching of German Dietrich Gerner, he soon showed his talent, breaking the national record and qualifying for the Brazilian team to 1948 Olympics, where he placed only 8th. However, at the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki and the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, he became a two-time Olympic champion and world record holder and the only Brazilian athlete to have won gold in two consecutive Olympics until the 2012 Summer Olympics held in London.

It was designated in May 1989, by the New York City Landmark Preservation Commission to preserve an irregular district of 440 buildings on 28 blocks and parts of blocks, from roughly 15th Street to 24th Street and from Park Avenue South to west of the Avenue of the Americas (Sixth Avenue).Pearson, Marjorie (ed.) \\"Ladies' Mile Historic District Designation Report\\", New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (May 2, 1989) Community groups such as the Drive to Protect the Ladies' Mile District and the Historic Districts Council campaigned heavily for the status.\\"Ladies' Mile District Wins Landmark Status\\", The New York Times (May 7, 1989)\\"The Drive to Protect the Ladies' Mile\\" The Ladies' Mile Historic District contains mostly multi-story store and loft buildings. These buildings became common after 1899 when laws prohibited combined home and production areas without a permit, causing people who had previously worked at home to seek commercial spaces; the rise of unions which advocated for better working conditions also contributed to the development. History The area first came to prominence in 1860, when the Prince of Wales stayed at the Fifth Avenue Hotel, located on the corner of Fifth Avenue and 23rd Street, signalling to New York's high society that the neighborhood was acceptable to royalty. Between the Civil War and World War I, the district was the location of some of New York's most famous department stores and upscale retailers, including B. Altman, Best & Co., Arnold Constable, Bergdorf Goodman, Gorham Silver, W. & J. Sloane, Lord & Taylor, and Tiffany & Co.Hevesi, Dennis. \\"When Computer Store Meets Historic District\\", The New York Times (August 3, 2005) The Ladies' Mile also boasted upscale restaurants, booksellers and publishers, and offices and showrooms for piano manufacturers, such as in the Sohmer Piano Building. Performance venues in the district included the Academy of Music and Steinway Hall; the first location of the Metropolitan Museum of Art was there as well. All of these attractions brought the rich and celebrities to the area, especially since the safety of the district allowed women to shop without male companions to accompany them. Ethel Barrymore, Isabella Stewart Gardner, Lilly Langtry and Lillian Russell were among those who might be found in the opulent shopping district at its zenith. Residents of the area included Horace Greeley, Washington Irving, Samuel F. B. Morse, Emily Post, Edith Wharton and various members of the Roosevelt family. When the district became more commercialized and less elite, many of the well-known residents moved uptown, and the upscale department stores and shops followed them. By the end of World War I, most of the buildings had been converted into warehouses, and lofts for manufacturers, as well as some residences. The majority of the buildings were not torn down, though, and by the 1980s they had started to be renovated and re-converted into large retail stores at street level, and sometimes above, so that the old shopping district is now one once again, albeit one which appeals to a very different clientele. Stores currently in the district include Bed, Bath & Beyond, Burlington Coat Factory, The Container Store, Marshalls, Old Navy, Sports Authority, Staples and Trader Joe's. A major anchor of the district is Daniel H. Burnham's Flatiron Building, at Fifth Avenue and 23rd Street; most of the Ladies' Mile Historic District lies within the Manhattan neighborhood named after that building, the Flatiron District.

The initiative appeared on the November 4, 2008, ballot in Massachusetts. The measure was passed on Nov 4. and became public law on January 2, 2009 Question 2: *Replaced criminal penalties with a US$100 fine of which the proceeds go to the city where the offense takes place. *Eliminated the collection of Criminal Offender Record Information (CORI) reports for minor marijuana related infractions. *Maintained then-current penalties for selling, growing, and trafficking marijuana, as well as the prohibition against driving under the influence of marijuana. *The law requires additional penalties for minors such as Parental notification, compulsory drug awareness program, and 10 hours community service that was not required under prior law. It also requires a larger US$1,000 fine and possible delinquency proceedings for those under 17 if they do not complete the requirements of the law. The law represents a break with prior law in Massachusetts, where people charged with marijuana possession faced criminal penalties of up to six months in jail and a US$500 fine, as well as a CORI report being filed. On Tuesday, September 10, 2008, a city councillor in Worcester called for a vote on a measure to express the opposition by the city of Worcester to the initiative.

History The National Commission on Marijuana and Drug Abuse (also known as the Shafer Commission) was created by Public Law 91-513 in 1972 to study marijuana abuse in the United States. It published its findings in a report called Marihuana: A Signal of Misunderstanding and recommended that the president should decriminalize possession of marijuana in amounts that constituted \\"simple possession\\".Marihuana: A Signal of Misunderstanding - 1972 Report So far 30 non-binding public policy questions calling for civil fines for possession of marijuana rather than criminal penalties have passed in legislative districts throughout Massachusetts since 2000. These questions were passed with an average of 62% of the vote in favor. No Public policy question related to replacing criminal penalties with civil fines has ever failed in the state of Massachusetts.MPP-New poll shows 71% in favor of Massachusetts decriminalization initiative! The Joint Mental Health and Substance Abuse Committee of the Massachusetts General Court voted 6-1 in favor of a bill that would have made possession of less than an ounce of marijuana punishable by a civil fine. Funding Billionaire George Soros made an initial contribution of $400,000. The committee has also received $750,000 cash as well as about $320,000 in donated time and services from the Marijuana Policy Project, an organization created to reform marijuana laws in the United States. According to campaign finance reports, as of November 1, 2008, the committee has raised approximately $1,250,000 to help pass the measure with $40,060.90 remaining.Committee for sensible marijuana policy donations Opposition The Coalition for Safe Streets, a committee organized to oppose Question 2, launched a statewide campaign Sept. 5 to defeat the measure. Jonathan W. Blodgett, the Essex County District Attorney serves as the Coalition's treasurer and chairman. Michael O'Keefe, the president of the Massachusetts District Attorneys Association, is opposed to the initiative. He believes that the measure will lead to an increase in minors using the drug by sending the wrong message to them. The O'Keefe Committee is one of ten committees representing district attorneys in Massachusetts that have contributed to the Coalition.Cape Cod Today: \\"District attorney opposes decriminalization of marijuana,\\" Sep 8, 2008 William Breault, chairman of the Main South Alliance for Public Safety in Worcester, also plans to oppose this initiative. Funding According to Campaign Finance reports, as of November 1, 2008, the ten committees representing district attorneys in Massachusetts have contributed approximately $2,275 each to the Coalition along with a donation of $2,500 from the Worcester County Deputy Sheriffs Association as well as a few other donors for a total of approx $60,000, after expenditures they have $0 to fight the initiative and $2,601.92 in outstanding liabilities.Coalition for safe streets finance reports Controversies On September 17, 2008, the Committee for Sensible Marijuana Policy filed complaints with the Office of Campaign and Political Finance and the Attorney General's office against the Massachusetts District Attorney Association, the 11 state district attorneys and O'Neill and Associates, a Boston public relations firm.

CSMP alleges that the district attorneys solicited, received, and spent donations before they were legally allowed to, attempting to conceal their campaign activity for as long as they could. * CSMP further alleges that the district attorneys used public funds to post and house a statement urging voters to reject the decriminalization initiative on its Web site, a violation of Massachusetts election law, which prohibits public officials from using public resources to advocate for or against a ballot initiative. The statement on the state run Massachusetts District Attorneys Association website says that if the question is approved, \\"any person may carry and use marijuana at any time,\\" which is untrue. Petition drive to qualify The support group collected over 105,000 signatures, far exceeding the requirement of 66,593 valid signatures. Since Massachusetts is an indirect initiative state, this meant that the Massachusetts State Legislature had to take up the proposed measure. Since the legislature declined to act on it by early May, the supporters then had until June 18, 2008, to collect another 11,099 signatures to ensure that the initiative is placed on the November 2008 statewide ballot, a goal at which they succeeded.Boston Globe: \\"4 ballot petitions clear 1st obstacle,\\" Nov. 24, 2007Boston Globe: \\"Proposal to decriminalize pot clears a hurdle,\\" Nov, 21, 2007Massachusetts Law Updates: \\"Proposals to decriminalize marijuana,\\" February 1, 2008 Results Enactment As per Massachusetts law, the initiative became public law on January 2, 2009, 30 days from the date it was presented to the Governor's Council and certified.

During locomotion, legs function as \\"extensible struts\\". The combination of movements at all joints can be modeled as a single, linear element capable of changing length and rotating about an omnidirectional \\"hip\\" joint. As an anatomical animal structure it is used for locomotion. The distal end is often modified to distribute force (such as a foot). Most animals have an even number of legs. As a component of furniture, it is used for the economy of materials needed to provide the support for the useful surface such as the table top or chair seat. Terminology *Uniped: 1 leg, such as clams *Biped: 2 legs, such as humans and birds *Triped: 3 legs, which typically does not occur naturally in healthy animals *Quadruped: 4 legs, such as dogs and horses Many taxa are characterized by the number of legs: *Tetrapods have four legs. *Arthropoda: 4, 6 (Insecta), 8, 12, or 14 legs. Some arthropods have more than a dozen legs; a few species possess over 100. Despite what their names might suggest, centipedes (\\"hundred feet\\") may have fewer than 20 or more than 300 legs, and millipedes (\\"thousand feet\\") have fewer than 1,000 legs, but up to 750. Components A leg is a structure of gross anatomy, meaning that it is large enough to be seen unaided. The components depend on the animal. In humans and other mammals, a leg includes the bones, muscles, tendons, ligaments, blood vessels, nerves, and skin. In insects, the leg includes most of these things, except that insects have an exoskeleton that replaces the function of both the bones and the skin. Sometimes the end of the leg, or foot, is considered part of the leg; other times it is considered separate. Similarly, the hip joint or other place where the leg attaches to the main body may be considered separate or part of the leg. Tetrapod legs The leg of a woolly mammoth (reconstruction). In tetrapod anatomy, leg is used to refer to the entire limb. In human medicine the precise definition refers only to the segment between the knee and the ankle. This lower segment is also called the shank, and the front (anterior) of the segment is called the shin or pretibia. In bipedal tetrapods, the two lower limbs are referred to as the \\"legs\\" and the two upper limbs as \\"arms\\" or \\"wings\\" as the case may be. *Human leg Arthropod leg *Arthropod leg Robotic leg A robotic leg is moved by an actuator, which is a type of motor for moving or controlling a mechanism or system. It is operated by a source of energy, usually in the form of an electric current, hydraulic fluid pressure or pneumatic pressure, and converts that energy into some kind of motion.

The Bell Tower of Xi'an (), built in 1384 during the early Ming Dynasty, is a symbol of the city of Xi'an and one of the grandest of its kind in China. The Bell Tower also contains several large bronze-cast bells from the Tang Dynasty. The tower base is square and it covers an area of . The tower is a brick and timber structure and close to high. It is located in the center of Xi'an, at the intersection of the four streets of the east, west, south and north. It is the largest and most preserved one amongst the many bell towers left over from ancient China. History Xi'an Bell Tower was built in the 17th year of Hongwu in the Ming Dynasty (1384). It was originally located at the Yingxiang Temple of Guangji Street, north of West Street, facing the Xi'an Drum Tower, about 1,000 meters away from its current location. At that time, this place was directly opposite the north and south city gates, and it was the center of the city. With the expansion of Chang'an City in the early Ming Dynasty, the city center gradually moved eastward. After two centuries, the city gate was rebuilt, and the new four streets of East, South, West, and North were formed. The bell tower at Yingxiang Temple seemed to deviate from the center of the city. In 1582, under the auspices of Shaanxi Provincial Supervision Officer Gong Yuxian, the county magistrates of Xianning and Chang'an were ordered to relocate them to the present site. In addition to rebuilding the pedestal, the construction of the intrinsic structure is all original, so the cost is not much and the project is rapid. But the overall migration of such a huge building more than 600 years ago is rare in the history of world architecture. Gong Yuxian's \\"\\" recorded the details of the migration project. In 1699, 1740 and 1840, Xi'an Bell Tower was repaired on a large scale. Among them, in 1740, the governor Zhang Wei rebuilt according to the original structure and found that the house covered with Jingyun bell was so airtight that the bell sounded \\"not to be out\\" and the sound outside was small. Therefore, the Tang Dynasty \\"Jing Yun\\" bell, which was originally suspended in the room, was removed from the outdoors, so that the sound of the time was far-reaching, and he wrote \\"\\". On October 10, 1939, the Xi'an Bell Tower was bombed by Japanese planes and was seriously damaged. After the bell tower was bombed, the Xijing Municipal Construction Committee Engineering Office repaired it. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, Xi'an Bell Tower was overhauled five times. In August 1956, it was listed in the Shaanxi Provincial People's Government as the first batch of key cultural relics protection units in Shaanxi Province. It was officially opened to the public in 1984. In November 1996, it was included in the national key cultural relics protection unit. Function Similar to other Chinese clock towers, Xi'an Bell Tower was mainly used for time reporting and publishing news in ancient times. With the progress of the times, its traditional functions have been gradually phased out, and now it is open to the society as a national-level cultural relics protection unit for tourism and sightseeing. Visitors can purchase tickets to visit the building. It has also been used for many other purposes in history. During the Revolution of 1911, the Rebels fought fiercely with the Qing army deployed here. During the War of Protecting the Nation, the Shaanxi Warlord Chen Shupan started the riots against Yuan Shikai from here. In 1927, Shilin, who came back from studying in the United States, opened a sound cinema here. This is the first cinema in Xi'an history. During the Anti-Japanese War, the Xi‚Äôan Bell Tower became an alarm station for warning the Japanese air raids because of its high terrain. The GuoMingDang also used its four-door door to imprison criminals. During the period after the founding of the People's Republic of China, it became the rostrum of the parade, review and celebrations on Labor Day and National Day. Architectural features Form The lower part of the Xi'an Bell Tower is a square- shaped pedestal with a masonry structure. The surface is made of blue brick and the base is a two-story wooden structure. The height from the ground to the top of the building is 36 meters, of which the base is 8.6 meters high. Each side is 35.5 meters long and has a construction area of about 1,377.4 square meters. There are stairs inside to hover up. The overall style is typical of the Ming Dynasty architectural style. The top is a triple-sided four-sided spire structure supported by a brawl. The top part is the ‚Äúgolden top‚Äù of the real gold platinum wrapped in the inner heart of the wood. The dark green roof tiles are covered with dark green glazed tiles, and the interior is decorated with gold paintings. In the middle of the pedestal, there are holes intersecting each other with a cross of about 6 meters. In the past, there were passages for the intersection of four streets in the southeast and northwest, and pedestrian vehicles passed through the cave. With the development of urban construction, the hole can not adapt to the traffic flow needs, and now the hole has been closed. There is a road turntable around the clock tower, and there is a circular passage for the pedestrians underground. Emboss The door and window carvings of the Xi‚Äôan Bell Tower are exquisite and complex, showing the decorative arts prevailing in the Ming and Qing Dynasties. There are 8 reliefs on each door leaf, and each relief contains an ancient Cultural relics Giant Bell The original giant bell of Xi'an Bell Tower was the \\"JingYun\\" bell cast by the year of Jingyun in the Tang Dynasty. It was originally used by Jinglong temple in Chang'an City (currently in Xi'an West Street today). It was moved to Xi'an Bell Tower in the early Ming Dynasty. In 1953, JingYun bell moved to Xi'an Beilin Museum and is now on display in Dongting. The Xi'an Municipal Bureau of Cultural Relics copied the Jingyun Zhong. It was hung on the northwest corner of the base of the Xi'an Bell Tower on January 30, 1997 and is now open to tourists. The imitation Jingyun bell looks similar to the original bell. The height is 2.45 meters, the weight is 6.5 tons, and the outer diameter of the bell skirt is 1.65 meters. The ornamentation and inscription resemble the original bell, and the sound quality is bright and majestic. Inscription The west wall of the first floor hall of Xi'an Bell Tower is inlaid with three inscriptions. The first one is the inscription on the inscription after the Xi'an Municipal People's Government renovated the clock tower in 1953. The second one is the Shaanxi governor Zhang Yishu after the five-year major overhaul by the Qianlong Emperor. The \\"\\" monument was written; the third is the \\"\\" monument written by the Shaanxi Provincial Supervision Officer Gong Yuxian. Couplet On the second floor of Xi'an Bell Tower, there is a couplet on each side of the doorpost, and they are all made today.

Early life Blatchford was born in Devonport, Devon, England on August 1, 1767. He was the oldest of four children born to Henry Blatchford and, his second wife, Mary (nee Heath) Blatchford, who married in 1766. From his father's first marriage, he had an older half-brother, John Blatchford, \\"who was eminent for his piety.\\" His younger siblings from his parents marriage were Jane Blatchford, Joseph Blatchford (who died aged five) and William Blatchford (who died in infancy).

Inuit describes the various groups of indigenous peoples who live throughout the Inuvialuit Settlement Region of the Northwest Territories and Nunavut of Northern Canada, Nunavik in Quebec and Nunatsiavut, these areas are sometimes known as Inuit Nunangat, and NunatuKavut in Labrador, as well as in Greenland and parts of Alaska. The term culture of the Inuit, therefore, refers primarily to these areas; however, parallels to other Eskimo groups can also be drawn. The traditional lifestyle of the Inuit is adapted to extreme climatic conditions; their essential skills for survival are hunting and trapping, as well as the construction of fur clothing for survival. Agriculture was never possible in the millions of square kilometres of tundra and icy coasts from Siberia to Northern America including Greenland. Therefore, hunting became the core of the culture and cultural history of the Inuit. They used harpoons, bows and arrows, and to take down animals of all sizes. Thus, the everyday life in modern Inuit settlements, established only some decades ago, still reflects the 5,000-year-long history of a hunting culture which allowed the Inuit peoples and their ancestors to populate the Arctic. Etymology Europeans in North America used to refer to the Inuit as Eskimos, but the people consider that term pejorative. The primary reason some people consider Eskimo derogatory is the questionable but widespread perception that in Algonquian languages it means \\"eaters of raw meat.\\"Kaplan, Lawrence. \\"Inuit or Eskimo: Which name to use?\\" Alaskan Native Language Center, UFA.

The first Inuit group, known as Paleo-Eskimos, crossed the Strait in 3000 BCE presumably on winter ice, which was long after earlier migrations by the ancestors to the North American Indians. Archaeological finds have revealed that the Paleo-Eskimos moved to the northern Canadian Arctic in 2300 BCE, apparently because of a change in climate. From there they gradually followed the herds of game across the Arctic to Greenland, and dispersed into more distinct nomadic tribes. Meliadine River, near Rankin Inlet Pre-Dorset culture is said to begin when the Paleo-Eskimos settled on the islands of the Canadian archipelago and northern Greenland. The descriptions \\"Dorset\\" and \\"Pre-Dorset\\" come from Cape Dorset on Baffin Island, the source of an assemblage which in 1925 anthropologist Diamond Jenness identified as originating from a hitherto unknown \\"Dorset culture.\\" The Paleo-Eskimos weathered the winter of the high Arctic with much more difficulty than their later descendants because they lacked technologies such as boats, harpoon-tips, dog sleds, dwellings other than skin tents, and sources of warmth other than small fire pits and wood fuels. In the central Canadian Arctic, they mainly hunted muskoxen and caribou with bow and arrow, and fished with barbed devices. Groups living near the coastline hunted seals, walruses and smaller whales by throwing harpoons from the shore or from sea ice. *Independence I culture 2300 BCE-1500 BCE This Paleo-Eskimo culture was named after Independence Fjord, where traces of a large settlement were found. Their lodgings were erected on elliptical foundations centred upon box-shaped hearths made of flat stones set on end. These they filled with driftwood, musk ox dung, and bones. They might have started fires with the help of a bow drill operated by sinews, which was in general use some centuries later. *Saqqaq culture 2400-900 BCE Hunting place of the Saqqaq culture on Disko Bay, photo by Jan Kronsell In the western and southern parts of the eastern coast of Greenland, the Saqqaq culture developed around 2300 BCE and lasted 1500 years. The centre of their settlements was Disko Bay near the place Saqqaq, which lent its name to the culture. The people extended their culture along the fjords and coastlines in the area. The culture of the Saqqaq people shows marked similarity to the culture that in the Canadian Arctic is described as \\"Pre-Dorset\\", and the two cultures developed around the same time. Scholars believe that the people of the Saqqaq split off from the Pre-Dorset culture, migrated into Greenland from Ellesmere Island in the north, and later migrated to the southern coast. Period IV (1000 BCE-1000 CE) Western Arctic *Kachemak tradition *Norton tradition *Choris, Norton, Ipiutak (in northern Alaska, the forerunners of the Thule people) Eastern Arctic *Independence II culture 800/600-1 BC Presumably for climatic reasons, northern Greenland was not populated for about 500 years afterward. Archaeological evidence has shown that before the disappearance of the Saqqaq culture from southern Greenland, a new culture arrived from the Canadian archipelago. The newer people showed a more developed culture from an archaeological standpoint. That culture is called Independence II culture, and it seems to have developed from the Canadian Pre-Dorset cultures. Possibly, they came in close contact with the Saqqaq culture. The range of distribution of the Independence II people approximately corresponds to that of the Independence I people. The oldest finds have been dated to 1400 BCE, and the most recent to 400 BCE. Researchers have not confirmed whether the farthest northern regions of Greenland were constantly settled during this 1000-year period, because only about 10 dwellings are extant. The climate of that time steadily worsened; the warmest temperature of the Independence II period approximately matches the coldest temperature of the Independence I period. Archaeological research has focused its fieldwork on areas of Greenland below 83 degrees latitude north for traces of the Independence II culture. In 1987 the remains of a larger Independence II settlement was discovered on the √éle- de-France (at about 78 degrees north). The Independence II people hunted the same animals as earlier cultures (seals and muskoxen), but for the first time also walruses. The houses of the Independence II period were similar to those of the Independence I period, only more complex. So far no connection between the two cultures has been proven. Independence II tools are more reminiscent of the Pre-Dorset and the later Dorset culture. The fate of the Independence II culture is unknown; it is possible that they migrated south along the east coast of Greenland and merged into the Dorset Culture. *Dorset Culture (500 BC-1000 AD) Thule artefacts on Mallikjuaq Island, near Cape Dorset Archaeological evidence shows that between 500 BCE and 500 CE, remarkable technological and cultural advances took place in the area of northern Canada and Greenland known as the Dorset region. Today this period is known as Dorset I. The Dorset people are probably identical to the Tuniit (singular Tuniq, also Tornit or Tunirjuat), who are described in Inuit mythology as powerful giants who dwelt in stone houses. They were believed to have been capable of enormous feats of strength, such as carrying walruses or moving enormous boulders. Their hunting methods were greatly improved over previous Arctic cultures. They probably invented the igloo,Igloo (originally iglu) can refer to any kind of house, although it is usually used to refer to domed snow dwellings. Definition which is difficult to determine because such ephemeral structures leave no archaeological evidence. They spent the winters in relatively permanent dwellings constructed of stone and pieces of grass; these were the precursors of the later qarmaqs. They were also the first culture to carve seal-oil lamps (qulliq, also spelled kudlik) from soapstone. In the next 500 years, known as the Dorset II period, the Dorset culture expanded to occupy the region between Victoria Island in the west to Greenland in the east to Newfoundland in the south. A shift in climate, which enabled them to settle high-Arctic regions, probably contributed to this. It is remarkable that the Dorset II culture uniformly maintained the stylistic attributes of the Dorset I culture despite this rapid territorial expansion. Igloo Ivory carvings date to as early as the Dorset I period, but artistic activity appears to have greatly increased in the Dorset II period. The presence of tiny human masks that subtly suggest animal features, carvings of bears with incised spirit lines indicating skeletal structures, and enigmatic tubes that may have been used to suck spirits out of the possessed; indicate the shamanistic, ritual character of this art. This cultural trend probably results from socio- economic pressures exerted upon the Dorset by the presence of new ethnic groups in the region. This period's climate was responsible for the Vikings' naming of Iceland and Greenland, labels that in our times sound paradoxical. Period V (1000 CE-present) =Western Arctic= *Koniaq *Old Bering Sea **Okvik **Birnirk **Punuk ** Thule‚ÄîBering Sea Thule *** \\"Western Thule\\" of North Alaska *** Canadian Thule **** Inugsuk Thule of Greenland *Thule culture (1000-1800 CE) An Inuk explains Thule settlement artefacts at Chesterfield Inlet The relatively temperate climate of the Alaska had allowed much greater cultural advances among the peoples there during the 3,000 years since the Pre-Dorset had left the region. =Cultural and technological advancements= The various peoples of the Alaskan coasts had in that period developed entirely new techniques for hunting and fishing; these technologies also fundamentally changed their lifestyle and culture. Developments included boats constructed of watertight seal skin stretched over wooden frames such as the kayak (Inuktitut: qajag), used by hunters, and the umiak, a large boat used by groups of up to 20 women; new styles of spears, and harpoons equipped with weights and floats. These technologies enabled the hunting of whales, which provided a valuable source of food (especially whale skin, rich in vitamin C) and expanded the range of available materials to be processed for construction (bones and skin) and heating (whale oil). The development of dog sleds and of igloos that could be entered by a tunnel provided easier travel for the people and warmer dwellings during the winter. All of these advances promoted the formation of new social, religious, and artistic values. =The wave of Thule migrations= The warmer climate of North America in 1000 CE increased the amount of habitable territory in the Arctic and contributed to population growth. Presumably, this development, along with the constant pursuit of quarry into higher latitudes and the search for meteorite iron, was a major impetus for the migration of the Alaskan Thule into northern Canada and Greenland. In the so-called \\"second migration\\", some of the displaced groups migrated south, settling in the Hudson Bay area. As Inuit myths explain, the Dorset-culture residents were assimilated by the technologically superior Thule in most areas but were massacred in others. The Dorset culture subsequently died out throughout the Arctic in a short period around 1000 CE. They held out for a few centuries longer in northern Labrador and in the Ungava region (until about 1300 CE); the isolated Sadlermiut survived until the early 20th century on the southern coasts of Southampton Island and two islands nearby, Walrus Island and Coats Island. Remains of a Thule dwelling (Ukkusiksalik National Park) The new arrivals were the direct ancestors of today's Inuit. They originated from the area around the Bering Strait, but are named the Thule after the location of the first traces of their settlements to be excavated: Thule, Greenland. =Thule dwellings= Resolute The typical Thule house was constructed from a framework of whale jawbones and ribs anchored in the tundra soil with rocks. Animal hides were stretched over the frame, which was covered with sod. As accommodations for long hunting trips, the Thule used hide-tents in the summer. =Artistic activities= Inunnguaq, \\"like a human form\\" (Inuksuk) While the artistic productions of the Dorset were almost exclusively shaped by shamanistic ritual and myths, such influences are barely detectable in Thule art. The utensils discovered in excavations of well-preserved Thule dwellings show only decorative incisions. These utensils were almost entirely functional, with no ritual purpose. Small figurative carvings in ivory of female figures, water birds, and whales have also been found in Thule sites, but in relatively small numbers. Occasionally water birds would be depicted with the heads of women and vice versa, but such shamanistic carvings are few among the already small proportions of figurative carvings in Thule art. Among the art of the Thule, the depictions of bears especially contrasts with the art of the Dorset. In Dorset art, bears are realistically depicted within stylistic conventions; today, these objects are interpreted as spirit-helpers or amulets against dangers encountered in the hunt. In Thule art, images of bears are limited to carved bear heads that attached to harpoon shafts. Whether they served a decorative or functional purpose is uncertain (probably both). The Thule used bear teeth as jewellery, or hunting trophies. The artefacts left by the Thule generally suggests that they led a more comfortable lifestyle and had leisure time to artistically decorate their personal effects- their art was not the result of social or economic anxieties. They constructed diverse and numerous Inuksuit (like a man), piled-stone landmarks that survive. Some are examples of an impressive art form. =Transitional phase (1300‚Äì19th century)= From the beginning of the 14th century, a gradual cooling occurred throughout the Canadian Archipelago and the Arctic Ocean coast of the mainland. The period between 1550 and 1880, the so-called \\"Little Ice Age\\", caused temperatures significantly lower than today's in North America and Europe (with a brief period of higher heat around 1800). The effect of the drop in temperature upon the hunting-dependent lifestyle of the Thule was significant. Entire regions of the high Arctic were depopulated, partly by mass migrations but also by the starvation of entire communities. The traditional way of life was maintained only by communities in the relatively hospitable regions of the Arctic: the southern end of Baffin Island, Labrador, and the southernmost tip of Greenland. In Greenland, the Thule developed a different social structure and new dwelling types, and became what is known as the Inugsuk culture. In Greenland, the beginning of the 17th century brought the first European whaling ships and sudden change. In the following 150 years, up to 10,000 whalers would annually pass the coast of Greenland and substantially influence the culture of the Thule living there. The emerging trade relationships made intermarriage with European-Canadians and European-Americans common; there were few genetically pure Inugsuk after several generations. =Historical period of the Inuit (from 1800)= The 19th century is regarded as the beginning of \\"Inuit culture.\\" Although the Thule traditions endured in a limited way, the living conditions of Inuit in the historical period were considerably worse than those of their ancestors 1000 years before. The technical standards and spirit of their artwork likewise began to decline. Carving and decorative engraving, for example, became rarer and less differentiated. The colder climate of the period and the resulting decline in animals as game meant that the Inuit were forced to abandon their winter settlements in search of quarry. In their newly nomadic way of life, the Inuit built more temporary winter dwellings. These were tent-like huts constructed of stone, grass, and snow. The Inuit called them qarmaqs. The technique of constructing igloos was further developed and became more widespread. =Contact with Europeans= Contact with Europeans was another important impetus for change in the culture of the Inuit. The earliest contacts with the Vikings, later with explorers, fishermen and whalers, affected Canadian Inuit (as opposed to Greenland's) less profoundly and more locally. Those early European arrivals did not intend to settle Canada. Such contacts proved fatal for many Inuit due to the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, smallpox and other infectious diseases. In contrast, tradesmen, missionaries and representatives of the Canadian administration established themselves in the region and directly influenced the life of the natives. The Canadians erected the first administrative and police stations in 1903, near the important whaling base of Fullerton Harbour on Hudson Bay and on Herschel Island northwest of the Mackenzie Delta. In that same year, the Norwegian Roald Amundsen started to transit the famous Northwest Passage with his ship Gj√∏a on a more southerly course than that of his predecessors, alongside the Canadian mainland. Starting at the beginning of the 20th century, radical changes occurred for the Arctic people. Greenland was visited with increasing frequency: Alfred Wegener led an expedition in 1912‚Äì13, and the Thule expeditions by Knud Rasmussen took place in 1915-1924. In 1933, the Permanent Court of International Justice attested Denmark's authority in Greenland, with cultural, political and structural impacts for the Inuit. In Canada, the Hudson's Bay Company tapped the previously unexplored \\"Barren Lands\\" of the Kivalliq Region to the west of Hudson Bay for trade. The Inuit no longer hunted animals for food and clothing, but mainly to acquire goods for barter with the emissaries of markets in the south and in Europe. The fur of the Arctic fox was especially in demand, but other kinds of fur and the ivory of walruses and narwhals were also desirable. The insistence on fox fur alone caused disruption as the trapping of foxes was traditionally done by the women. However, the numbers required by the traders meant travelling long distances over the trap line and it became men's work (see Menstruation and Family life below). Due to trade, the Inuit could acquire goods of the European-Canadian civilization, such as weapons and ammunition, tobacco, coffee, tea, sugar and flour. To keep the hunters associated with the trading posts, the traders lent them traps and extended credit to the Inuit. Becoming more dependent on another people meant that the native society had lost its former self-sufficiency. Therefore, changing their cultural development. =19th century social structure and way of life= Traditional Inuit clothes; Amauti The basic social structure of the Inuit in the 19th century consisted of an estimated 50 groups of 200 to 800 members apiece. The membership was based upon the voluntary association of large and loosely composed clans. The clans in turn were made up of extended families- the grandparents, parents, and children. Such a loose social structure, which allowed families self-sufficiency and self-governance, increased the chances of social survival in times of scarcity. Hunting provided the Inuit with a balanced diet and the raw materials for clothing, housing, household implements and heating, boat and sled-building, hunting weapons, toys, and art-objects. Stones, carefully chosen and carved, were used for select but important objects: arrow, spear, and harpoon heads, hide-scrapers, and knives. Soapstone, a relatively soft and easily carved material, was used for the production of oil lamps (qulliqs) and cooking vessels. Women eating maktaaq, a traditional Inuit delicacy (the skin of a Greenland whale) Plant-materials played a small role in Inuit culture, as they were so rare. Wood is scarce in the Arctic, except in the form of occasional driftwood. The bones, tusks, and antlers of hunted animals were used in its place. Berries were collected in large numbers during the late summer, but while they provided a source of some vitamins, they were far from sufficient. The people met their vitamin requirements by eating raw animal products, such as muktuk (whale skin and blubber), meat and fish. The Inuit tradition of living in tents during summer and in igloos and qarmait (singular: qarmaq, warm half-subterranean houses made from boulders, whale bones and sod) in winter still followed the Thule practices. The most important principle of all building constructions was the lowered entrance tunnel, which served as a windscreen and cold trap. The inner living area was constructed at a higher level so that the heavier cold air could not easily enter it. Girl children played with string figures within the igloos, as preparation for learning to sew and partly as a ritual act. The girls of the Chugach people mainly played this in autumn because it was believed this weaving captured the sunrays and thus delayed the beginning of winter. Often the creation of string figures was accompanied by rhymes and songs describing tales, legends and myths.Frederic V. Grunfeld (Ed.), Oker: Spiele der Welt II. (in German) Fischer, Frankfurt/M 1984. The Inuit had developed winter clothing that ensured an effective use of the body heat, avoiding holes that would allow air to leak out. Apart from seal, mostly caribou skin was used, and in Greenland polar bear fur. In order to create a cushion of warm air, the clothing was loosely tailored and worn in two layers, the outer one with the hair inside, the inner one with the hair outside. In summer, only the inner layer was worn. The hood fixed on the inside of the coat avoided the leaking of warm air at the neck. Mothers used an additional part of their hoods for carrying the toddlers in their parka (amauti). Nomadic life in the first half of the 20th century Camp Ikirasaq (Southern Baffin Island), abandoned in the late 1940s Many elders still remember the time, more than 60 years ago, when the Inuit lived a nomadic lifestyle. Depending on the seasons (up to sixteen according to old traditions), they followed the animals they hunted for clothing and nourishment. They had to relocate and reconstruct their camps frequently and followed the same traditions for generations. At the turn to the 20th century, most Inuit still lived in hide tents during the summer. Sometimes, they already owned canvas tents obtained from the Hudson's Bay Company. The interior was divided into a back part used for sleeping, usually raised by coat underlays, and a front part for cooking and living; a tradition still in practice today. The woman's sleeping place was always beside the kudlik, an oil lamp usually carved from soapstone used for lighting, heating and cooking, because it was her duty to operate it. The man's sleeping place was near the weapons and hunting equipment; the children were nestled between their parents for warmth. Today the kudlik is replaced by a product of modern industry, the Coleman stove, which is easy to transport and operated by gasoline and naphtha. Dressing a ringed seal Fishing for Arctic char In the few months of summer, the people moved camp to the estuaries, because there it was easier to catch the favoured Arctic char, e.g. by using artificial weirs, and the eggs of seabirds. For the inland Inuit, the caribou was the most important resource; it provided meat, a hide for clothing, and sinew for rope. The coastal Inuit hunted mostly seals and walruses and, depending on the region, narwhals and belugas; of course also the occasional caribou. The seals were used for food for men and dogs. Their oil was used for the kudliks, and their skin and sinews for seal boots (kamik), kayak coverings, ropes (also drag ropes for dog sleds) and dog whips. During the winter, the Inuit lived in igloos, which were erected separately or connected by tunnels. Snow of a specific consistency was necessary to build them. They had the same general interior arrangement as the tents. The most important element was a lowered entrance tunnel, repelling the heavier cold air and the wind from entering inside. As additional prevention against cold, the sleeping area was elevated by a layer of snow as compared to the living area. Some of the families that wanted to live in permanent camps, built themselves a partially subsurface home of rocks, whale bones, coat and sod, the so-called qarmaq. The construction of such camps is certainly based on the Thule tradition. During the winter, they used qarmaqs, but in summer preferred the more airy tents. A traditional dog sled (qamutik), today almost entirely replaced by the snowmobile, except for festive occasions. Due to the hard weather conditions in winter, in this season the families joined closer together. Mutual visits at hunting places of different groups were for the exchange of news and experiences, but mostly for the exchange of food from different sources. In winter, travelling was done by dog sleds, partly presumably also by foot. During the warmer seasons, mainly the people used the kayak, or, mostly as \\"women boat\\" for families, the large umiak, and travelled by foot. Traditional land routes were, e.g., from Wager Bay to Repulse Bay in north, to Chesterfield Inlet with the adjacent Baker Lake in the southwest and to Chantrey Inlet at the Arctic Ocean in the northwest.  Transition into the 21st century   Fundamental change of living conditions  Between 1800 and 1950, the culture and way of living of the Canadian Inuit, who had not known any monetary system before, changed fundamentally. Complete self- sufficiency and independence were to a large extent replaced by dependence on goods of western industrialized countries, such as clothing, many kinds of foodstuffs, weapons, tools and technical equipment. This development was largely due to the fact that as hunters and trappers, they could develop only a low level of productivity that could not financially cover the Western way of living. Moreover, the products of the kill depended too much on market and fashion fluctuations, not to speak of concerns related to protection of species and of the environment. Life on the land, following tradition (Camp Najutaqtujuq, North Baffin Island) Post-World War II, the northern regions were increasingly incorporated into a Cold War strategic defense concept, and military and radar stations of the Distant Early Warning Line (DEW Line) were established. Although this developed the infrastructure and created jobs, it also led to a sudden urbanization that not every community could adapt to. Traditional ways of living were increasingly constrained and eliminated, with no provision made for the transition to the new way of living. The transitional difficulties were further enhanced, for example, by the fact that at the end of the 1940s, the Kivalliq Region had to be placed under quarantine because of the appearance of serious infectious diseases such as polio (for which there was as yet no vaccine). At the same time, the caribou population west of Hudson Bay nearly perished. As a consequence, the Inuit of that area lost their food supply. Those Inuit still mostly living in camps faced an increasing threat from tuberculosis; many who contracted the disease had to be treated in sanatoriums in the south. Many Inuit tried to continue their traditional way of living in their ancestral regions while adapting to the new conditions. But, they became more dependent on governmental welfare. The Canadian state had primarily scientific interest in its northern regions during the first half of the century. Beginning in the 1950s, it became concerned about three issues: military security requirements, discovery of economically important natural resources, and an increasing sensibility for the special concerns of the Inuit. The government felt the need to exercise governmental control and sovereignty over the territory. The Canadian government created a Department of Indian Affairs and Natural Resources in 1953 (now Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada). This department established social benefits such as unemployment aid, social welfare, care of the sick and of the elderly, child allowance, comprehensive educational and welfare programs of the industrial areas of Canada. At the same time, the Canadian government forcibly moved many Inuit families from their traditional hunting grounds into new and empty areas, to reinforce claims of Canadian sovereignty.ERIC - Tammarniit (Mistakes): Inuit Relocation in the Eastern Arctic, 1939-63 Drum dancer in a Camp near Meliadine River By the mid-1950s, dramatic changes had occurred for the Canadian Inuit, which lasted well into the 1960s. There were differences among the regions of Nunavut, such as the Qikiqtaaluk (Baffin), Kivalliq or Kitikmeot. The common characteristic was the extensive change from the nomadic to the sedentary way of living. Inuit left their camps and moved into settlements with permanent buildings. The wooden building replaced the igloo, qarmaq and tents originally made from hide. Since then, the Inuit have lived in residential buildings prefabricated in the south of Canada and‚Äîbecause of permafrost‚Äîbuilt on stilts. These buildings are heated with oil stoves (every building has a holding tank for heating oil). Fresh water is delivered by tankers, and sewage is brought away the same way. The buildings contain kitchens with electric range, sink, and freezer; a bathroom with shower and/or bathtub, and flushing toilet; washers and dryers have become common. Like other westerners, many households keep their TV sets on almost 24 hours a day. The people use fax machines and e-mail for correspondence.  Traditional customs   Menstruation  Traditionally, young Inuit women received little information about puberty, fertility, and pregnancy. Consequently, elders describe that it was not uncommon for young women to remain in bed when they reached menarche, believing that they were sick or physiologically different.Qinuajuak, L. (1996). Inuit birth traditions. Midwifery Today and Childbirth Education, (40), 56. Once informed, the young woman's mother would instruct her on menstruation practices and often, the camp (or community) would become apprised of her situation. During menstruation, women were expected to follow certain practices including, 1) not sitting where men sat, 2) using rabbit skin, foxesSkipper recalls bringing TB infected Indian back to Coppermine or mossesHealth care in North must acknowledge Inuit values, traditional medicine and other garments, with the exception of men's garments, for sanitary pads, and 3) laying rabbit skin on the bed at night to soak up blood. According to elders, women had to abide by more rules than men because of their menstruation and some rules were not only considered tradition, but also taboo if not followed. For example, using a man's garment for a sanitary pad could prevent the young woman from finding a husband for marriage.Nakasuk S, Paniaq H, Ootoova E, Angmaalik P. (1999) Pregnancy. Interviewing Inuit elders Introduction (1): 141-143. Nunavut Arctic College.  Marriage  Marriage commonly occurred when the female reached 14‚Äì15 years of age and the man reached adulthood, considered around 20 years of age. The marriage was traditionally arranged by the parents of the couple, possibly as early as infanthood, and often reflected a desire to strengthen the bond between families. In some parts of the Arctic, men also practised the tradition of \\"stealing\\" their wife from a camp, symbolically showing that the family did not want the daughter to leave their camp. In these cases, the family would later celebrate together and the woman would then join the husband's territory.Boult D. (2006) The Inuit Way: A Guide to Inuit Culture. Pauktuutit Inuit Women's Association. Childhood of the Inuit was still very brief the first half of the 20th century. Especially girls entered marriage at an early age. Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, it was mostly the families who decided which children should marry whom, i.e. arranged marriages. Marriages often served to strengthen family ties, and girls had no say in choosing their partners. Sometimes a young man who had not yet been pledged, sent to the parents of the girl, without being personally present in those negotiations. The wedding was completely unceremonial (the same was true for birthdays). After Christianization, the only change was that now the couples also received Christian marriage ceremonies whenever a priest travelled their areas (often months after the actual marriage). When finally government administration had been established, marriages were also registered by the administration, initially by police officers, later by the local administrations. Since moving from the camps to the settlements, more couples live together without marriage. This way, they feel less tied but also less responsible. But still, in the 1970s, it was in no way unusual to make agreements regarding newborns about eventual marriages. However, when these promises of marriage became due, fifteen or twenty years later, they were taken less and less seriously. Before Christianizing (referred to as Siqqitiq by the Inuit), polygamy, more often polygyny, less so polyandry, were not unusual among the Inuit. Extramarital relationships were accepted especially during extensive hunting trips, and there were so-called \\"lamp extinction games\\" with ritual partner exchanges. According to a popular theory, these traditions reduced the danger of inbreeding and resulting population bottleneck in small and isolated settlements. With colonization, these customs led to great conflicts: On one hand such traditions were thought by missionaries as sinful, on the other, they were interpreted as sexual arbitrariness and taken advantage of, often leading to prostitution and sexual exploitation.Bar√ºske, Heinz. (in German) Gr√∂nland. Kultur und Landschaft am Polarkreis. DuMont, Cologne 1990,  Family life The Inuit arrived in North America somewhere between 6000 BC and 2000 BC, they were one of the last groups to arrive to North America. Inuit cabin built for use while on the land hunting and fishing Until the middle of the 20th century, i.e. until the move from disperse camps to settlements, the sexual division of labour between men and women within the families and family groups in northern Canada was traditionally arranged fairly well, and rather different: The men were responsible for the acquisition of food, especially for hunting and fishing, and for technical work (including the construction of igloos, qarmaqs, and tents). The Inuit women were predominantly in charge of intra-family concerns, such as caring for little children, taking care of the kill (conservation of meat, cleaning of furs, and the like), the sewing of clothing, fire keeping in the qulliq, etc. (their participation in hunting and fishing was limited). Whenever a family lost its breadwinner (for example in an accident), it was usually dependent on support by other families, and the widow was sometimes adopted as an additional wife by a close relative of the deceased (see widow inheritance). However, due to men being required to sometimes travel large distances to obtain food the division was not absolute. Men, for example, would need to know how to sew in case repairs were needed to their clothing. At the same, time women were required to know how to hunt and be able to help with igloo building. The move from the camps to the settlements, which essentially took place during the 1950s, brought about significant changes in this respect: The Inuit now were immediate subjects of governmental administration and care (also social welfare). By occupations that were completely new to them, like in health care and local administration, but also in Inuit arts, the women with their earned money were able to contribute like the men to the livelihood of their families. Nowadays, the division of tasks and responsibilities between male and female Inuit are, following Canadian legislation, not very different from western industrialized nations, of which the Inuit are considered a part. In the Northwest Territories the first female premier was Nellie Cournoyea, an Inuk. In Nunavut, female representatives and ministers are as common as their male counterparts. There are Inuit municipalities with female mayors, for example.  Health disparities  Nunavummiut, 85% of whom identify as Inuit, experience wide gaps in health status and access. The people of Nunavut have a life expectancy which is more than 14 years shorter than the Canadian average (66.8 years vs. 81 years).Ashawasegai, A. (2011). Inuit in crisis: Canada failing northern peoples. Windspeaker: Aboriginal Multimedia Society, 29(4), April 10, 2014. This is likely affected by its astonishingly high suicide rate, which is eleven times the national average. Smoking rates in Nunavut are more than double the national average.Nunavut Tobacco Reduction Framework for Action 2011-2016, Government of Nunavut Department of Health and Social Services, 2011 The fertility rate is more than twice as high (3.3 vs. 1.5 nationally). Of particular concern in Nunavut is rapid urbanization and subsequent overcrowding, with many homes without improved sanitation facilities. Food insecurity is another concern, with nearly 57% of children living in food insecure households as measured by University of Toronto researchers.Nunatsiaq Online. (2013, July 30, 2013). Study: More than half of Nunavut children live in food insecure households. Nunatsiaq Online This dovetails with Nunavut's high obesity rate, which stands at 45.4%- more than twice the national average of 21.8%.  The context of birth  The Second World War and subsequent Cold War initiated a newfound interest in the Arctic by the Canadian government.Douglas, V. (2006). Childbirth among the Canadian Inuit: A review of the clinical and cultural literature. International Journal of Circumpolar Health, 65(2), 117-132. Its vast mineral resources and strategic proximity to the USSR brought rapid development to the region. The study of the Inuit people's health outcomes also began, finding vast health disparities between northern and southern Canadians. This prompted the opening of several nursing outposts in the Northwest Territories, including what is now Nunavut to provide primary and some secondary care to the Inuit population. These proved successful, and several studies found that Inuit had better access to primary care than many southern Canadians. To aid in maternity care, the government in Ottawa began recruiting midwives from England and New Zealand to work in the Arctic regions, which preserved the woman-centred midwifery model of care practiced by the traditional Inuit midwives. However, this was short-lived due to more stringent immigration laws passed in the 1970s. The physicians recruited to replace these midwives advocated for a medicalized, tertiary-care level birth, and a de facto policy of flying women to southern hospitals for labour and delivery was adopted. In the 1970s and 1980s, nearly 100% of pregnant women were flown out of their homeland to give birth. The most popular routes‚Äîfrom north to Yellowknife, Ottawa, Ontario; Churchill, Manitoba; or Winnipeg, Manitoba could be more than 1,000 miles. So common was the fly out to give birth that Inuit culture began to adapt to this almost inevitable fact. To announce a newborn member of their community, many Inuit proclaim \\"the newborn has arrived\\" instead of \\"the baby is born\\".Qanuuqturniq- finding the balance- chapter 1: Birth, a joyous community event. (2009, May, 2009). [Video/DVD] Iqaluit, NU: Aboriginal People's Television Network. Retrieved from TV Show - Maternity Care Chapter 1 Due to the fact that the infant is several weeks old when it arrives in its homeland, it is common for members of the community to shake the baby's hand to welcome him or her to the community.Ekho, N., & Ottokie, U. (2000). Childrearing practices. In J. Briggs (Ed.), Interviewing Inuit elders (pp. 1-137). Iqaluit, NU: Nunavut Arctic College. In the early 21st century, about half of Inuit women are flown out from Nunavut to southern hospitals for delivery, and evacuations consume more than 20% of the territory's health budget.Payne, E. (2010, November 26, 2010). The residential schools of medicine. Ottawa Citizen They normally leave two to three weeks prior to their due date and return two to three weeks after birth. There are reports of Inuit women returning home after more than one month away to find their house in ruins and their other children poorly cared for. Inuit culture is closely tied to the land and community, and birth outside of this land causes cultural dissonance. Many Inuit women interviewed about the practice remarked that their children born outside of Nunangat were not truly Inuit. Some communities, such as Cambridge Bay, have a birthing centre available for low risk births and in 2014 two local women graduated from Nunavut Arctic College's midwifery program.Nunavut gets two new midwives in Cambridge Bay The centre is available for all communities in the Kitikmeot Region. However, higher risk and first-time mothers must still go to the hospital in Yellowknife.Cambridge Bay's birthing centre waits for its babies  Pregnancy behaviors and beliefs   Pregnancy  In regards to conception and pregnancy, young Inuit woman were discouraged from engaging in sexual intercourse during puberty, ages 11 to 13 years, until they reached \\"prime maternity age\\", after marriage, about 15. Similar to menarche, many young Inuit women were unaware about the indications of their first pregnancy. Elders recount that young women often thought that they had been cured of their menses when they experienced amenorrhoea for the first time. It was not uncommon for the young woman to learn about her first pregnancy from her mother or grandmother when she began to show (or carry weight). According to elders, pregnancy was also determined by, \\"looking into the face\\" of the young woman and/or feeling her stomach for a fetus. Once aware, it was important that the woman immediately divulge her pregnancy status to her mother, husband, and close community, as the Inuit believed that her status demanded special considerations and/or treatment to ensure the health of mother, baby, and camp. To prevent miscarriage, the husband and camp were to assure that the woman did not become mentally stressed or exhausted during the pregnancy. This taboo extended to include not allowing the husband to get angry with his wife at any time during the pregnancy. If miscarriage did occur, the woman was expected to inform her mother and the camp right away. According to traditional Inuit beliefs, hiding such a secret would bring bad luck for the camp such as, hunger, lack of food, or illness.  Taboos (pittailiniq) in pregnancy  In pregnancy, women's care was traditionally guided by the taboos, known as pittailiniq, from the elders in the community. These taboos, which were passed down through generations and varied somewhat across geographic regions or camps, informed the woman's behaviors and activities in order to prevent complications, promote a healthy birth, and ensure desired characteristics of the infant. For example, in regards to activity, the Inuit had many pittailiniq about maintaining physical activity throughout pregnancy and resisting idleness or laziness, which was believed to adversely affect labour and birth. The Inuit words sailliq and sailliqtuq, distinguished between the women who relaxed (sailliq) as appropriate, and those who relaxed too much, sailliqtuq. Another common pittailiniq instructed the woman to massage her stomach until she felt the fetus move, so that the baby wouldn't \\"stick\\" to the uterus. In interviews with Inuit elders, numerous pittailiniq about the woman's activity and behavior in pregnancy are discussed. Some of these are listed below. = Pittailiniq on activity in pregnancy = *In the morning when you wake, go outside as fast as possible, to ensure a short labour and fast delivery *Don't relax too much or the placenta might stick to the womb *Don't lie around or take naps or the labour will be long *When you stretch sealskin on a frame, don't wind the rope around your hands because this would cause the umbilical cord to be wrapped around the baby's neck. *Don't put anything bowl-shaped on your head so the placenta won't get stuck on the baby's head. *Don't walk backward or the baby will be breech *Don't put your head or arm part way through a doorway or into a hole because during birth the baby will present and retreat back and forth, or the baby will come out arm first = Pittailiniq on behavior in pregnancy = *When called outside or asked to perform a task, do so immediately to ensure a speedy delivery *If you begin a project such as sewing, finish it or the labour will be longer *Don't scratch your stomach so that stretch marks will be less noticeable *Don't speak about or stare at other peoples' physical oddities such as a big nose, or your baby will have even more serious oddities *Untie everything that is tied up so that you will be more dilated when the baby is ready *Don't wear tight pants while pregnant so that you will have an easier delivery *Don't clean your hands with an ulu or knife in order to prevent a dry, painful birth and risk of perineal tears *Don't make bubbles with gum or blow up a balloon or your membranes won't rupture *Face your bed toward a doorway. If it is sideways toward the door the baby will be transverse *Don't allow your legs to get cold during pregnancy, because this will cause hemorrhaging after birth  Diet in pregnancy  The Inuit also followed many taboos (pittailiniq) about diet and consumption in pregnancy. Consistently, elders report that pregnant women were to abstain from raw meat, eating only boiled or cooked meat, during pregnancy. Men were also expected to observe this rule, but only when in the presence of their wives. The preferential treatment of pregnant women also extended to food, and the best pieces of meat and food were always reserved for the pregnant woman. The pittailiniq regarding the diet of pregnant women demonstrate the strong emphasis on maternal diet affecting infant beauty and/or appearance. Some of these pittailiniq are listed below. = Pittailiniq on diet in pregnancy = *When eating, be sure to finish the meal and lick the plate. This ensures that your baby will be beautiful. *Eat caribou kidneys to ensure that you have beautiful babies *When eating seal, swallow a seal cap to have a nice round baby *Do not drink directly from a soup bowl or the baby will have dark skin *Do not chew candle wax during pregnancy or the baby will be covered with a white coating at birth *Eat seaweed if you want to have a boy  Preparation for birth  According to elders, the women were not taught how to prepare for birth. Women expected and trusted that they would receive instruction and advice from their midwife and other birth attendants (i.e. mother and/or mother-in-law) during the event. When labour and birth were perceived imminent, the woman and/or her attendants would set up a soft bed of caribou skins or heathers nearby. A thick layer of caribou fur on top of the heathers was desired in order to soak up the blood lost during birth.  Birth attendant(s)  According to elders, birth ideally occurred with both an assistant and midwife, but due to hunting-based economy/survival, many births occurred in transit or at a hunting camp. In these cases, the elders report that either the men would assist or the woman would endure birth alone. Due to the uncertainty of their location at the time of birth, the woman was often unaware of who her midwife was until birth. In the community, a midwife (Kisuliuq, Sanariak) or \\"maker\\" was a highly revered female member of the community, who had acquired experience and skills in birth by attending births with their mother, an elder, or other midwife of the community; often beginning at young age. The responsibilities of the midwife varied somewhat by geographic region and camp, but often included, 1) comforting the woman, 2) knowing a woman's body, including 'what was inside', 3) instructing the woman during labour on what to expect, 4) repositioning the woman to promote quick deliveries, and 4) dealing with complications. In most communities, a man only became intentionally involved in a birth if he was an angakkuq. In cases when the midwife or elder suspected a \\"spiritual or supernatural interference\\", the angakkuq would intervene to remove the spiritual interference of a spirit or another malicious angakkuq, to restore the spiritual balance and normal birth conditions.  Labour  Labour and birth were times of great celebration in the Inuit community. Traditionally, when a woman began having contractions, her midwife would gather other women of the community to help the labouring woman through the birthing process. Additional signs of labour noted by the Inuit midwife included, a brown strip of discharge, broken water, stomachache, or the urge to pass a bowel movement.Gafvels, K. (2010). Bringing birth back: Midwifery implementation in nunavut. Unpublished manuscript. Although it was cause for great celebration, labour is traditionally a time of quiet and calm in the Inuit community, and the midwife would commonly whisper her counsel to the mother-to-be. If the woman had followed the superstitions throughout her pregnancy, she could expect her labour to be quick and easy. Many of these also extended to the actions of the woman's midwife, who was also commanded to be swift in all aspects of her life so that her client would enjoy a quick delivery. Very often, women were expected to continue their daily chores up until the late stages of labour and endure labour pains without the aid of pain management. The midwife's goals during labour typically included keeping the woman from becoming irritable or screaming, preventing her legs from opening, preventing her from having peeing or having a bowel movement, and encouraging activity and position changes. (Inuit Midiwfiery ppt). The positions in which an Inuk woman laboured varied according to the midwife's preferences and her own comfort. These include, lithotomy, side lying, squatting, and standing positions have all been described in the literature. Often, a caribou pelt was placed under the woman and she was allowed to choose a bed or the floor. Some communities' midwives employed the use of equipment such as ropes to pull on or a box to lean over to help ease the pains of labour, but little evidence of either pharmacologic or homeopathic pain relief is described. Traditionally, the woman was required to have her spine completely straight for the entirety of her labour and delivery. To facilitate this, the midwife would often place a wooden board behind the woman to keep her back aligned. Additionally, a rolled towel or block of wood was used to keep the woman's legs and feet apart during labour, which, in the midwives' view, helped to speed the labour along.  Birth  In traditional Inuit birth culture, the birth event was handled almost exclusively by the midwife. However, the woman played an active role in her own birth experience and was encouraged to follow her body's own physiologic cues regarding pushing and rest. When she was ready to push, the midwife would tell the woman to pull on her hair with both hands and bear down. While most Inuit women gave birth at home, in some communities of western Nunangat women gave birth in separate birthing huts (aanigutyak) built exclusively for this purpose.Barnes, T. (2014) . Retrieved April 13, 2014, from Childbearing practices of Native Alaskans If this was not done, the place where the woman gave birth must be abandoned. Once the baby had crowned and was born, the midwife would cut the still-pulsating umbilical cord with a special knife and tie it with caribou sinew. The midwives knew that the sinew carried a much lower risk of infection than other materials available to them. The cord was cut with enough length to pull out the placenta by hand if necessary. After the child was born and the placenta was ready for delivery, many Inuit midwives would instruct the woman to get on all fours and push in this position.James, S., O'Brien, B., Bourret, K., Kango, N., Gafvels, K., Gafvels, K., & Paradis, J. (2009). Meeting the needs of nunavut families: A community-based midwifery education program. Rural and Remote Health, 10(2), 1355. Midwives were also versed in providing fundal massage to reduce the risk of postpartum hemorrhage. Some Inuit communities wrapped the placenta in cloth and buried it among the rocks of the tundra.  Postpartum  Sources on traditional Inuit birth practices provide little reference to the postpartum period. One elder midwife in Nunavut described that after birth her mother-in-law very briefly cared for the house and chores until she felt better. She also described however, that she was feeling better soon after birth and eagerly performing chores behind her mother-in-law's back. In regards to physical care after birth, the information is also minimal. Women, who are able to breastfeed, do so immediately after birth, often continuing for two years or longer. Breastfeeding served as their only method of contraception and birth spacing. While breastfeeding, the elders describe the importance of keeping the breasts warm to prevent cracking and drinking broth for nutrition. If perineal tears have occurred during the delivery, they are left to heal on their own; the Inuit do not traditionally perform episiotomies or suture tears.  The newborn  The birth of a newborn into the camp is cause for widespread celebration in the community and everyone, including children, would shake hands at its arrival. And it was believed that if the mother followed the pittailiniq in pregnancy, the child would be healthy and follow a good life in the community. Immediately after birth, the infant was assessed for breathing. If the infant was not breathing, then the midwife would hang the infant upside by his feet and slap his buttocks. The midwife also removed mucus from the infant's mouth, using either a wipe or her own mouth, to ensure that the baby was able to \\"fatten\\" in the coming days. The exposed cord stump was then covered with burnt arctic moss and the infant was placed in a rabbit fur or cloth pouch, sewn by the sinaji. The pouch served not only to keep the infant warm but also as a diaper and protection for the healing umbilical cord stump. It was believed that the cord stump should fall off on its own and not be looked for by the parents. If the mother found the cord stump, it indicated that the child would become hyperactive around age four. The infant was not routinely washed after birth. Traditional Inuit midwives describe that the first stool (meconium) should be observed outside the womb, as it could cause clotting and complications if left in the mother. The treatment for which was to massage the woman's stomach, promoting blood flow. They midwives also expected the infant to urinate almost immediately after birth, indicating that there was no obstruction or genital abnormality. Infants, as well as the rabbit or cloth pouch, were always dried promptly after urinating or having a bowel movement. And by a year of age, elders claim that children were toilet trained. Also occurring immediately after birth, a designated person, often the midwife, felt the infant's genitalia to determine its gender. This person then became the infant's sanaji (for an infant boy) or arnaliaq (for an infant girl) and assumed a lifelong role in the child's life. If the infant was a boy, he would later call this person his arnaquti and give her his first catch as a child. The sanaji was also responsible for cutting the umbilical cord, providing the infant's first clothes, naming the child (tuqurausiq), blessing the child (kipliituajuq) and conferring the desired characteristics onto the child. It was believed that the child's direction was shaped from the earliest days of life and consequently, these practices were held in high esteem as they determined the child's future.Interviewing Inuit Elders Childrearing Practices In rare instances, the child might be considered sipiniq (), meaning the infant is believed to have changed their physical sex from male to female at the moment of birth. This concept has primarily been historically attested in areas of the Canadian Arctic, such as Igloolik and Nunavik. Sipiniq children were regarded as socially male, and would be named after a male relative, perform a male's tasks, and would wear traditional clothing tailored for men's tasks. This generally lasted until puberty, but in some cases continued into adulthood and even after the sipiniq person married a man. Once assessed by the midwife and/or sanaji, the infant was promptly given to the mother for initiation of breastfeeding. According to elders, the infant remained in nearly constant physical contact with her mother from the day of birth; sleeping on the family platform, riding in the amauti (baby carrier on the mother), or nestled in her parka for feeding.  Naming the newborn  Performed by the sanaji or midwife, the tuqurausiq was the highly valued naming practice that linked the child to a relative or deceased family friend. The Inuit believed that when the infant was born, he/her took on the soul or spirit of a recently deceased relative or community member. Through the name, the child literally assumed the relationship of his/her namesake. For example, if a child were named for someone's mother, family members would then call that child \\"mother\\" and give the child the same respect given to that mother. The infant's name also represented an important factor in his/her behavior. In particular, the Inuit believed that crying was an indication that the infant wanted to have a particular name. And that often once named, the infant would stop crying. In addition, as the infant or child is a representative of their namesake, they are considered to generally know what they want or need. For example, when they are hungry or tired. Given this belief, it was also considered inappropriate to tell an infant or child what to do, as it was similar to commanding an elder or another adult, which violated social rule in Inuit culture. When an infant or child exhibited the same behavior as their namesake it was called atiqsuqtuq. Children in the 21st century are still named for other family members but the name may be an English one rather than a traditional Inuit name.  Newborn outcomes  Compared with non-Inuit Canadians, Inuit have higher fertility rates, higher prevalence of births to mothers age 15‚Äì19 years, and worse birth outcomes. According to 2012 government statistics, the Inuit population has an infant mortality rate of 26.3 deaths per 1,000 live births, as compared to 4.1 deaths per 1,000 live births in the larger Canadian population. In addition, the Inuit experience a neonatal death rate of 9 deaths per 1,000 live births, versus 4 deaths per 1,000 live births in the Canadian population.  Push for a return to community birth  Beginning in the late 1970s and 1980s, women in Nunavut and the other areas of Nunangat began a push to end the practice of being flown to the south of Canada (Douglas- Rankin Inlet). This was based on a widely held belief in the region that birth of Inuit children within the Inuit homeland would strengthen the family unit and increase social cohesion. A large anthropological study confirmed strong correlations between the social dissonance caused by birth evacuation and a spectrum of social ills facing Inuit society. Furthermore, Inuit women wanted to return to their traditional practice of woman-centred midwifery, using knowledge passed down through the generations to complement a community-centred birthing experience. In 2008, the government of Nunavut passed the Midwifery Professions Act.Nunavut Department of Health and Social Services. (2008). Nunavut maternal and newborn health care strategy 2009-2014. (). Iqaluit, NU: Government of Nunavut. This far-reaching provision extended a full scope of practice regarding prenatal, birth, postpartum, and primary care to registered midwives. The act also permitted Nunavut Arctic College to open a midwifery-training program, the curriculum of which is required to include traditional Inuit midwifery knowledge.  Birth centres in Nunavut  In 1993, the first birth centre in Nunavut opened its doors in Rankin Inlet. Heralded as a first step in returning birth to the North, the Rankin Inlet Birth Centre was a fledgling operation for most of its first decade. Today, more than half of Nunavummiut women give birth in southern hospitals- mostly in Yellowknife, Churchill or Ottawa. Only about 20% of the women in the surrounding Kivalliq region of central Nunavut give birth in the centre and less than half (47%) of the births of Rankin Inlet itself take place there. Its marginal success has been linked to its relatively low capacity, having only two maternity care workers employed there at any one time- both of whom are almost always southern Canadian midwives there on short-term assignments. The birth centre has handled approximately 600 births since its opening. A University of Manitoba audit in 2008 found that the centre has provided consistently safe maternity care since its opening, with not one case of maternal mortality.Canadian Nurse. (2009). Nursing in Nunavut. Retrieved April 14, 2014 A second birth centre is housed within the Qikiqtani Hospital in Iqaluit. The Qikiqtani birth centre handles the majority of births, which occur in Nunavut, about 400 per year. The centre, opened in 2007, houses four birthing suites and a full surgical backup should the woman need it. The centre is equipped to handle breech, VBAC, and other complicated vaginal births using a physician-led team as well as midwives. At eight percent, the centre's cesarean rate is the lowest of any hospital in country. The Qikitqtani birth centre has reduced the evacuation rate on Baffin Island considerably, and there is little need for low-risk women to leave the territory to give birth. The centre's intervention rate is lower than the national average and is considered a model for the rest of the territory.  Death  Human remains on a beach near Bathurst Inlet Resolute on the Barrow Strait (Parry Channel) When the Inuit still lived in camps or as nomads, they had no special tomb sites, much less cemeteries. Before burial, the women of the camp washed the body of the deceased and adjusted the hair; on dead women they braided the hair starting at the forehead. Then they wrapped the body in a large blanket of caribou hide or wool and laid it down far out in the tundra, face up. They stacked cairns on top, to protect the body from scavengers. Nevertheless, scattered human bones can be found throughout the tundra, testifying to the work of carnivores. Similar burial customs have been found through the centuries. For example, Qilakitsoq mummies dating from 500 years ago show that the Thule people, ancestors of the Inuit, wrapped and protected their dead the same way. The Inuit believed the aurora borealis to be visible signals from the dead or the spirits of the dead. Some believed that whistling would bring the lights to earth where they would remove the whistlers head for use as a football. In some areas Inuit children feared the ghosts of those deceased long ago and often whistled or blew air against their hands, in order to \\"blow away\\" those supernatural beings. In other areas, such as eastern Greenland, the aurora were the spirits of dead children.Aurora Borealis - The Northern Lights In pre-missionary times it was usual to give a newborn child the name of a close relative who had died shortly before. This way, ancestors could experience a kind of return to a new life in the child. This custom has survived to this day, although the traditional animism religion has largely given way to Christianity. Since the move to the settlements, the dead are buried in cemeteries. All members of the community participate in requiems that last for hours, during which the towns appear deserted. Due to the frozen permafrost, burial sites are not deep, and are covered with rocks. Sometimes a blue plastic layer can be detected between the rocks. Here and there, a wooden box with a vitrified cover a few fading artificial flowers and other decorations can be seen. Crosses stand askew on the shifting permafrost. The inscriptions show that many of the dead are children, victims of accidents or natural disasters, and also suicides. Infrequently, there is a wooden hut outside of the town, where those that died during the winter are preserved in natural cold, until the warmer season permits their burial.  Challenges created by a changed way of life  Given such changes in their way of life, keeping their own identity and recollection of history and ancestors proved to be an extraordinary challenge many Inuit could not meet. These changes led to alcohol and drug problems. The suicide rate of the Inuit rose four times as high as the one of the remaining population of Canada. In the early 21st century the infant mortality rate is still high, about four times higher than the rest of Canada, and the lifespan relatively short, about 13 years less than the rest of the country.Life expectancy in the Inuit-inhabited areas of Canada,1989 to 2003 However, the Inuit population has grown considerably since the 1960s when there were about 12,000Lords of the Arctic: Wards of the State and, as of the 2016 Canadian census, increasing to just over 65,025, distributed among some 70 settlements, some of which have a population of a few hundred only. They account for about 0.142% of the total population of Canada, and about 4% of the indigenous population, as of 2011. From 2006 to 2016, the Inuit population grew by 29.1% and the total Aboriginal population has grown by 42.5%‚Äîmore than four times the growth rate of the non-Aboriginal population over the same period.Aboriginal peoples in Canada: Key results from the 2016 Census Within a very short time, modern technology replaced methods and technologies that had been passed on for centuries. Firearms replaced lances and harpoons, snowmobiles, mainly Polaris, Ski-Doo and Yamaha took the place of dog sled teams (the name Ski-Doo is often used for the whole category, since Joseph-Armand Bombardier 1922 built the first snowmobile, Ski- Dog, which mutated to Ski-Doo by a typographical error). ATVs (all-terrain vehicles, quad-bikes) became widely accepted as a general means of transportation. The Inuit have become consumers who make their living by fishing, hunting, trapping and production of artwork. They also perform wage labour, and often must be supported by additional social welfare. Government support is often the only source of income. The number of recipients is much higher than the average of Canada. Also, the share of employees in public service is 20 to 30 percent, compared to 7 percent for Canada. This is extremely high, and has been rising even higher since the creation of Nunavut. Nowadays only a few areas are left where traditional methods of hunting and fishing have been preserved in their original form.  Adjustment to conditions of living in a modern industrial nation  Square Dance from the time of Scottish whalers, which today the Inuit dance in many variations The capitalist way of thinking in the south of Canada has been a large challenge for the Inuit. It was a drastic experience for the population of a homogeneous, that in an earning-focused, achievement-oriented society authority, power and wealth were defined in a very different way. Before, they were independent in their way of living, but now they saw themselves tied to the chains of a monetary system. Consequently, new patterns of behavior arose, which put enormous strain on family ties. The adjustment to totally different conditions of living, even more so in new administrative centres that were organized by Canadian public employees by the rules of an industrialized country, was understandably difficult for the Inuit. Many have not come to terms with the changes to this day; they do not feel part of either the modern culture nor of that of their ancestors. The proselytizing by the Anglican Church and the Roman Catholic Church in the first half of the 20th century, which must be critically viewed in some respect, was also of fundamental significance for the cultural change of the Inuit. Although the Arctic nowadays is considered largely Christian, elements of Shamanism appear to persist fairly well at the subliminal level, side by side with Christian thought, despite its condemnation by the missionaries. Day Care Centre, (Cape Dorset) The adjustment to life in a modern industrialized country is easier for the young people who find new types of opportunities, but also all the problems that can be paraphrased by the keyword \\"TV culture\\". Compulsory education was introduced in the 1950s, replacing the traditional master- apprentice relationship between parents and children that did without reading and writing skills. Some Inuit were trained to be teachers and clergymen, but their numbers still were much too low. Basic education nowadays takes place in nearly all settlements. In Nunavut during the first three school years, the Inuit language, either Inuinnaqtun or Inuktitut, is the relevant language of instruction. In many schools of the Arctic, \\"elders\\", older residents who are recognized for their experience, are teaching the traditional knowledge, known as Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit, about culture, customs and way of living from the pre-settlement time, during planned lectures. Despite all efforts, the number of dropout is generally rather high, because of lack of motivation, among other reasons. Distribution of frozen, fermented walrus meat As part of the Government of Canada's assimilation policy many Inuit children, along with First Nations, were sent to residential schools. Children were taken from their home communities in the summer and sent to a school in a centralized area where they would remain for an entire school year. These included Sir Alexander Mackenzie Day School in Inuvik which included the two residences, Stringer Hall for Anglicans and Grollier Hall for Catholics, and Chesterfield Inlet Indian Residential School which included the Turquetil residence. The year away from their homes caused multiple problems upon return. Children were not permitted to speak their native language while at school and thus had problems communicating to community members who spoke little or no English. At the same time the loss of traditional skills meant they were less able to occupy the roles that they would have normally taken up. Later in the 1970s schools were built in the communities but most did not go beyond grade 7/8. Therefore, this meant leaving the home town during the school year, which was very difficult for many, to attend high school. However, this was at the parents' and child's choice rather than forced schooling. Because of this, there were only a few Inuit with higher education, since they would have to leave during the years of study. In the 21st century all Inuit communities in the Northwest Territories and Nunavut offer schooling up to grade 12. This has increased the graduation rate but it still below that of the rest of Canada.Graduation rate, Canada, provinces and territories, 2005/2006 to 2009/2010 In the NWT Aurora College and Arctic College in Nunavut offer education programs throughout the territories. These include the Nunavut Teacher Education Program which graduates primary, junior and high school teachers with a Bachelor of Education degree and the Akitsiraq Law School program. Some programs, such as general upgrading, are offered in the home community while others are only available in certain places. There has been no lack of intensive effort to find ways for the Inuit into a largely self- designed future, and to help them with a recollection of their own values and of their personal identity. It was important in this context to convey a new role of men and women. In the past, the man was responsible for family life and survival, while the women in the camp were charged with the young. Now often both of them have to master new tasks, thereby skipping several stages of development, with this process taking a course different from what happened in the European cultural area. It is not seldom that the woman assumes the sole role of the breadwinner, while the man is unemployed.  Cooperatives, a formula for success  Big hopes were put into the establishment of cooperatives, today the Arctic Co-operatives Limited, that were to help convey to the Inuit the skills of creating added value, so they would take care of themselves again and at the same time preserve their traditional culture. These cooperatives, mostly managed by Qallunaat (non-Inuit), did in fact prove very successful, because they succeeded in connecting economic thinking with traditional activities and values not only theoretically. The cooperatives developed activities in disparate areas. They were active in the provisioning of goods and services, such as trading with oil, gas, gasoline and construction materials, the organization of supermarkets with foodstuffs, clothing and technical goods, of hotels and restaurants, the construction of recreational and tourism facilities. On the regional level, the cooperatives ran commercial fur trade and fishing, as well as the production of downs and feathers. Stone carver in front of his house In the area of culture, the cooperatives and similar associations were intensely devoted to fostering artistic skills, which were, and still are unusually pronounced among the Inuit. The production and trade of Inuit art, i.e. of artistic and crafted objects, mainly sculptures made from serpentine, soapstone and marble, and soon afterwards also of graphics (drawings, lithotomies, lithographs, erasures) and tapestry (for example hangings), yielded excellent economic and cultural successes. In the course of the past 50 years this branch of the cooperatives reached an extraordinary importance for value added in the Inuit regions, and clearly ranks first, far ahead of trading hunting products: antlers, fur, or ivory, but overproduction is a growing problem. There is a similar problem with this type of art in Greenland, like the tupilaqs from East Greenland made from walrus ivory. In 1965, the turnover of Inuit cooperatives with trade of artistic objects and true arts was still below 100,000 Canadian dollars, but two or three decades later it has risen to $5 million, at gross prices, respectively (turnover not registered is estimated at a few additional million dollars). Despite manifold attempts in expanding the areas of activity, real added value still occurs mainly in the consumer goods sector, and scarcely in the real branch of production.  Current developments  During a period of five thousand years, the Inuit groups have grown apart ethnically. However, the increasing integration into nations foreign to them that were extending into the Arctic made them realize after World War II that they could maintain their cultural identity only if they appeared united at the international level. Therefore, the Eskimo groups of Canada united with their relatives in Alaska and Greenland (after the dissolution of the Soviet Union also with the Siberian Chukchi) to the \\"Pan- Eskimo Movement\\". This movement is supported by the Inuit Circumpolar Council, that was founded in 1977 as the Inuit Circumpolar Conference after a lead time of four years and to which its protagonist Eben Hopson (North Slope Borough, Alaska) was invited with his vision of constituting a unified, independent Eskimo nation. During the 1980s and 1990s a nationalistic trend could indeed be felt, and there was no lack of wishful thinking to achieve the dream of circumpolar unity. But in the reality of daily life, rational and last but not least fiscal thinking prevailed.  Nunavut  Nunavut Parliament building in Iqaluit Government building in Cape Dorset (Kinngait) With all efforts to preserve and cultivate cultural values of the past, the Inuit also want the progress of the modern industrial society. They show concern about the endangering of the environment by technical processes associated with the exploitation of resources, but are also interested in a future of western standards. They have also recognized that they are much better able to influence their conditions of living to their own ideas, when they agree within regional bounds on the goals to be pursued. The Canadian Inuit, just like the other indigenous peoples (First Nations and M√©tis people) of Canada, grew the demand for collective ethnic rights and a territory of their own, with a government composed of their kind, and Inuktitut as one of the official languages. On the federal level, the Inuit got the right to vote in 1962. The first Inuk to be elected Member of Parliament was Peter Ittinuar in 1979. In 1976, the organization Inuit Tapirisat (\\"Inuit Brotherhood\\"), now the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami (\\"Inuit United with Canada\\"), for the first time demanded the creation of a separate territory in the northeast of Canada. After more than 15 years of negotiation between Inuit and the Federal and Territorial Governments, finally an agreement was reached, the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement, which determined that from April 1, 1999, the north of Canada should be composed of three territories: Yukon, Nunavut and the remaining Northwest Territories. Like the two other territories, Nunavut was placed under direct control of the Canadian federal government and received increasing administrative autonomy. The Inuit have substantial local rights of control. They participate in the execution of important administrative positions, including police, legal and social welfare offices. Inuktitut is official government language, besides English and French.  Accord of Nunavik  An accord, the James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement, between the Canadian federal government, the Province of Quebec and Inuit representatives resulted in the establishment of the Kativik Regional Government and gave a bigger political autonomy to the Nunavik region. As a result, all residents of the 14 Nunavik settlements elect their own representative in regional elections.  Settlement of land claims and titles  An important chapter of Canadian Arctic policy regarding development of the Inuit culture is reflected in the agreements settling Inuit land claims opposed to the Canadian state. The advancing exploitation of the Canadian Arctic and if its mineral resources led to ever more conflicts about land ownership and title between Inuit representatives and Federal Government. Land that is not under private ownership is considered as Federal land, but the Inuit claim large areas that they have inhabited and utilized for many centuries. The agreement reached in 1984 regarding land claims of the Inuvialuit (Inuit in the western Arctic) provided means to improve the situation of the indigenous residents of this region, by assuring of land to 2,500 Inuvialuit, as well as monetary compensation, funds for improving the social structure, hunting right, and more influence on dealing with the fauna, on natural and environmental protection. The Nunavut Land Claims Agreement signed in 1993 with the Tunngavik Federation of Nunavut is the most comprehensive agreement ever reached in Canada. As a result, about 17,500 Inuit receive of land, monetary compensation, a share of the profits from exploiting the mineral resources, hunting rights and a larger voice in questions regarding land and environment. Also in the north of the province of Quebec, land claims of Inuit groups were settled successfully. In addition, there are ongoing negotiations with the Association of Labrador Inuit, which represents about 3,800 Inuit living in the interior and on the eastern coast of Labrador, a part of the province of Newfoundland and Labrador.  Traditional Inuit culture and self-determined life  Traditional game with stones (1995) Inuit artist Kenojuak Ashevak playing pool billiards in a hotel in Berlin (2004) The Inuit place a high value upon self-determination. The governments of Nunavut, the Northwest Territories and Nunatsiavut do not have political parties, but operate as consensus governments. Difficult questions are common in judicature, where traditional Inuit concepts are opposed to the legal system of the Canadian state.  Preservation of tradition and culture  In general, the government of Nunavut sees one of its most important tasks to be the preservation and care of Inuit tradition and culture. Currently, it puts great effort into recording and archiving the oral accounts of \\"elders\\" about the time before the move of the Inuit into the settlements. It is high time for this, because the number of elders with this knowledge are dwindling. The festival leading up to the new year is Quviasukvik.Quviasukvik. The celebration of an Inuit winter feast in the central Arctic  Contemporary literature  A special part of the centuries-old cultural heritage of the Inuit are their myths and legends, which had been passed exclusively by word of mouth, because the Inuit had no written language and consequently had no literary tradition. In the Inuit culture story telling had the function that in other cultures literature has. The oral recital of passed-on knowledge gave the Inuit families particularly a feeling of immediate togetherness. At the same time, narrating made a connection between past and present, because the essential statements had been passed from generation to generation and accepted as the truth, without reservations. Among the Inuit, there are even nowadays few authors in the strict sense: writers mainly produce reports, summaries and essays about traditional contexts, or their own experiences (\\"non-fiction\\"), in seldom cases poems (mostly anthems) or songs. A few noted Inuit writers have written works that are classified as novels, including Mitiarjuk Nappaaluk's Sanaaq, Markoosie Patsauq's Harpoon of the Hunter\\"Markoosie\\". Oxford Reference. and Tanya Tagaq's Split Tooth,\\"Tanya Tagaq steps out onto an unfamiliar stage\\". Now, September 12, 2018. although even these works often defy conventional Western notions of literary genre, typically blending both fictional and non-fictional elements.\\"Fracturing to Survive in Tanya Tagaq's 'Split Tooth'\\". PopMatters, January 17, 2019. Among the best-known Inuit authors are the former Commissioner of Nunavut (the highest governmental representative of the territory), Peter Irniq (born 1947 on the Lyon Inlet, Kivalliq Region), the writer, poet, cartoonist and photographer Alootook Ipellie (born 1951 in a camp near Iqaluit, died 2007 in Ottawa), Michael Kusugak the children's author, and the former president of the Makivik Corporation and active author Zebedee Nungak (born 1951 in the south of Puvirnituq, Quebec).  Contemporary music  The Inuit did not have a very distinct tradition of music. There were \\"Aya-Yait\\", songs used for passing experiences from generation to generation, and so called because of their refrain \\"aya-ya\\". In a musical sense, they were simply-structured compositions. The traditional \\"throat singing\\" as well as the ritual drum dance by no means claim to be artistic compositions, but they were used for entertainment and for mythological-religious customs. The Inuit first heard European melodies by listening to the whalers. With those, they saw European instruments for the first time, the fiddle and the accordion, both of which have remained popular among the Inuit to this day. They also learned the square dance from the whalers. For the past twenty years, a kind of pop music is catching on in the Arctic, which the Inuit adopted from the south and then modified their own way. Today Susan Aglukark (born in 1967 in Churchill, Manitoba, and grew up in Arviat) is perhaps the most popular Inuit singer. Other singers include Tagaq, Charlie Panigoniak and Lucie Idlout.  Contemporary fine arts  Contemporary Inuit art and handicrafts did not come about before the late 1950s as important resources for added value. soapstone sculptures, artistic drawings, hangings and tapestries (the latter mainly in Arviat, Baker Lake and Pangnirtung), attire, ceramics and dolls are providing a basic livelihood to a large number of Inuit artists of all ages today, just like hunting and fishing.  Added value in Nunavut  Modern Inuit yacht in a bay of Qikiqtarjuaq, available for tours to remote fjords and glaciers along the east coast of Baffin Island It is extremely important for the territorial government of Nunavut to look at ways to clearly rise the national product, which also means to conciliate the Inuit's deeply rooted tradition with the challenges of modern life. Hunting, trapping and fishing essentially serve their subsistence and by far do not contribute enough added value, as would be needed. In addition, the trade with more significant products gained from these activities, like seal furs, or ivory from narwhal or walrus, is subject to international restrictions. The revenue from artistic or handicraft work, although a significant contribution to added value, provides a sufficient livelihood to only a few, particularly because of the large family sizes that must be supported. This branch of economic activity by its nature can secure the future of only a limited number. The growth of tourism is also limited. It is difficult to secure sufficient enrollment for group tours to the Arctic, and customized tours do not bring much money to the area. Cruises contribute more to added value than other types of tours. Given all of the above, the central task of the territorial leadership is the conciliation of tradition and modern life. Whether the exemplary Nunavut model of self-determination will be successful, finally depends on the question if there will be trained Inuit in sufficient numbers in the foreseeable future who will be able to provide leadership. The backlog of education and training is still immense. Big opportunities will open for the Inuit to maintain their traditional culture and still live up to the claim of being members of a nation that embraces diverse cultures within a modern industrial country, but only if those responsible for Nunavut succeed in training executives in sufficient numbers for the immense tasks that are the consequence of creating a self- governed territory.

Binational structure While it may be similar in concept to the One-state solution and Isratine proposal, Federal Zionism focuses upon the entrenchment of the Jewish character and self-determination of the Jewish-majority component in such a federalized situation instead of an expanse of the Jewish population to a wider geographic area. Federal Zionism may also call for the granting of certain jurisdictional powers of autonomy to regions within the State of Israel's Jewish majority areas, akin to the pseudo-federal structure of the Twelve Tribes of the ancient Israelites. For instance, one solution would be the partition of larger districts, such as South District, for the purpose of increased regional self-governance and self-responsibility. The implications of a federalized binational structure could also result in a further demarcation between religious and secular populations in both ethnocultural communities, particularly as a result of prior withdrawal and self-segregation of more orthodox sects of Judaism from non-Orthodox populations.

The Kerry bogslides natural disaster occurred in the Maghanknockane area of Lyrecrompane, County Kerry, Ireland in August and September 2008. The original bogslide extended over four kilometres on 22 and 23 August destroying an estimated 10 hectares (25 acres) of bog, engulfing two bridges and led to the closure of a section of road; it was reported that it could take anything up to six months to fix the road. The plot of land owned by Moss Moore which inspired John B. Keane's play The Field escaped the disaster by only a couple of kilometres. Comparisons were drawn with the occurrence of an earthquake as it was claimed that a 30-metre (100 ft) wide section was missing from the hill. The event was likened to the 2003 Derrybrien landslide in County Galway. A second bogslide occurred on 3 September 2008, blamed on heavy rain overnight which led to a \\"small slippage\\" of bog material. The slippage happened between two bridges, Harris and Scanlon, on a tributary of the Smerlagh River and again forced the closure of a local road.  Effects  Kerry County Council officials spent an entire day creating diversions to stop the flow of peat from the first bogslide. A dam was created to direct the bogslide away from the path of a river. Up to 30,000 people in north Kerry were left without a water supply due to polluted watercourses and threatened reservoirs. A boil notice was placed on the local water supply. Several homes in a rural area between Tralee and Castleisland were cut off. A Bog Slide in Donegal One environmental effect of the bogslide was a serious fish kill on the River Smearlagh. Thousands of \\"mature and juvenile\\" trout and salmon were killed in peat which had travelled over two miles (3 km) and was at a depth of eight to ten feet. Shannon Regional Fisheries Board officer, Lorraine O‚ÄôDonnell, claimed that it could take \\"up to a decade\\" for the river and the spawning grounds to recover. Fisheries officers were unable to access to a tributary of the river, the Glashoreag. It was completely overwhelmed by the slide. The area was an important nursery for salmon and eels before the disaster. Maurice Harrington and his wife Joan would normally have been collecting bags of turf but escaped from the disaster unharmed. Maurice's son, Mossie, first noticed the bog moving the day before. Maurice's other son, Patrick, assumed the bog movement he witnessed was due to poor eyesight. Maurice lost over ‚Ç¨1,000 worth of turf in the disaster. Joan and Patrick moved out the next week.  Possible cause  Residents in the area said that machinery on the site of a wind farm on nearby Ballincollig Hill might have contributed to the bogslide which was caused by heavy rain. Work had begun on the site two weeks prior to the disaster. Local residents had expressed concern about the possible risk of a landslide as far back as 2001 when initial planning permission was sought by Tralee-based Tr√° Investments for the windfarm. In July 2004 several people wrote to EU Commissioner for the Environment, Margot Wallstr√∂m, to voice their concerns about the threat to protected birds of prey should the windfarm development proceed. With their objections over-ruled, the development was approved by An Bord Plean√°la in June 2004. Tr√° Investments is to carry out an independent inquiry into the cause of the disaster.  Bog slides in literature  Threatened by development, the peat bog that plays a starring role in The Curse of the Wise Woman, a 1933 novel by Lord Dunsany, flips over completely. Not truly a slide, but a rise and fall in the volume size of a natural bog swallowing up the road to and from a home on an island called Eel Marsh House takes place in the novel and all adaptations of Susan Hill's work, The Woman in Black.

SVA is best known for being an umbrella organization for student veterans' groups that advocates for improvements in veterans educational benefits. Its efforts, combined with other veterans' service organizations, led to passage of the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2008. Senator Jim Webb (D-VA), a lead sponsor of the legislation, has cited SVA's efforts as one of the primary reasons the new G.I. Bill was signed into law on June 30, 2008. Overview SVA has two major components: the executive leadership staff at SVA National Headquarters, and the on-campus SVA chapters of student veterans. The local SVA chapters are student groups that have formed on college and university campuses to provide peer-to-peer networks for veterans who are attending those schools. The chapters are designed to be an advocate for student veterans, and to help bridge the campus-to-career transition. They coordinate on-campus and community outreach activities, facilitate pre-professional networking, and provide a touchstone for student veterans in higher education. These SVA chapters are an important part of ensuring that every veteran is successful after their service. The executive leadership staff facilitates communication between the SVA chapters, connects them with external resources, and organizes these chapters to advocate at the state and national level for the common needs of student veterans. Chapter Affiliates The Bureau of Labor Statistics recently highlighted the inextricable link between education and employment in noting that over 60% of all new jobs created from now until 2018 will require a postsecondary degree or credential. Veterans, however, face significant barriers to degree attainment that range from feeling like an outsider on a campus of 18-year-old traditional students to coping with the visible and invisible wounds of war. SVA classifies these barriers into three categories: administrative, reintegration, and academic. Administrative challenges are linked to accessing benefits and navigating campus bureaucracies. Reintegration issues arise as transitioning veterans try to develop a new identity and sense of belonging. Academic struggles typically stem from long periods away from academia due to military service. Vincent Tinto, renowned education researcher, notes that without peer support these challenges can become insurmountable obstacles that lead to isolation and high dropout rates. SVA chapters do not pay any dues to associate with the national organization and each group is encouraged to utilize national best-practices to address local issues. A recent RAND study noted that 61% of student veterans found the support they received from fellow veterans as ‚Äúquite or extremely helpful to the pursuit of their educational goals.‚Äù SVA chapters are fulfilling a critical function on hundreds of campuses nationwide. There are more than 1,500 SVA chapters.https://studentveterans.org/aboutus National Headquarters Student Veterans of America's national office is located in Washington, DC and consists of a number of professional, paid staff members. History SVA‚Äôs Predecessors Before the end of World War II, President Franklin Roosevelt signed into law the Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944, otherwise known as the G.I. Bill of Rights.Glenn C. Altschuler and Stuart M. Blumin, The GI Bill: a new deal for veterans (2009) p 118 After demobilizing, returning veterans flooded colleges and universities around the country. Not only did these student veterans face basic challenges associated with reintegrating into civilian life, but schools were unprepared for this influx of students, which led to additional problems for veterans like severe housing shortages and lack of transitional assistance. Student veterans banded together, forming peer-to-peer support networks to overcome these challenges and earn their college degrees. Through the '70s, '80s and '90s, veterans continued to transition to campus following their military service, albeit in smaller numbers. The revised Montgomery G.I. Bill was offered as a recruitment incentive for the all-volunteer force. Some of the local student veteran groups that formed on campuses after conflicts in Korea and Vietnam, like those at Northern Illinois University and the University of Wisconsin-Madison, still exist today. SVA‚Äôs Genesis ‚Äì The Post-9/11 G.I. Bill Following the September 11, 2001 attacks, the U.S. launched Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) (Afghanistan) and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) (Iraq). As OEF and OIF veterans returned home to use G.I. Bill benefits, they found that their campuses did not provide adequate support services to assist student veterans as they worked towards their educational goals. Lacking support, student veterans decided to organize on campuses across the country. These groups began to connect with one another through social media - spreading best practices, sharing success stories, and supporting fellow chapters to further strengthen the student veteran community. In 2008, members from roughly 20 schools convened in Chicago to formalize this grassroots movement and found Student Veterans of America. SVA was officially incorporated between the 18th and 20 January 2008 to provide programs, resources, and support to the ever- evolving network of local student veteran organizations‚Äîtoday known as SVA chapters. Concurrently, SVA and a number of Veteran Service Organizations were tirelessly advocating for an overhaul of the G.I. Bill to address the needs of the 21st Century student veteran. Six months after SVA's founding, President George W. Bush signed into law the Post 9/11 GI Bill. SVA Today With a focused mission on empowering student veterans, Student Veterans of America (SVA) is committed to providing an educational experience that goes beyond the classroom. Through a dedicated network of more than 1,500 on-campus chapters in all 50 states and 4 countries representing more than 750,000 student veterans, SVA aims to inspire yesterday's warriors by connecting student veterans with a community of like-minded chapter leaders. Every day these passionate leaders work to provide the necessary resources, network support, and advocacy to ensure student veterans can effectively connect, expand their skills, and ultimately achieve their greatest potential. SVA programs and initiatives fall under these categories:  Support Students  The heart of SVA is the student-led chapter. SVA supports a network of over 1,500 schools and over 750,000 student veterans. At the individual level, SVA empowers veterans to be informed consumers of higher education and make the most of the transition to civilian life.  Train Tomorrow's Leaders  Every year, SVA hosts Regional Summits and the Leadership Institute, a highly-selective colloquium of SVA's best students. The sessions offer chapter management, budgeting, and strategic planning skills.  Protect the G.I. Bill  SVA is a guardian and steward of both the Post-9/11 G.I. Bill and Forever G.I. Bill, and SVA founders had an important part in the bill's genesis. SVA's Government Affairs team advises lawmakers and advocates in eight issue areas such as student debt and STEM fields.  Conduct Groundbreaking Research  The initial Million Records Project (MRP) offered facts to policymakers, service providers, colleges, and the public. SVA has launched two new research initiatives: The National Veteran Education Success Tracker (NVEST) adds education levels, majors and completion rates of Bill recipients and The SVA Spotlight survey provides annual demographic insights.  Plan the SVA Annual National Conference  The SVA National Conference is the nation's largest annual gathering of student veterans. NatCon 2021 will be held in Orlando, Florida on January 7‚Äì9.  Develop Sustainable Support  SVA's development team builds corporate partnerships that fund student-veteran success. Board of directors The SVA Board of Directors has ten members.

The Squadron is based at Luscombe Airfield, Holsworthy Barracks, Sydney and forms part of the 6th Aviation Regiment. The Squadron originally operated fixed-wing aircraft designated as the 173rd General Support Squadron and was later renamed the 173rd Surveillance Squadron. In 2010, the Squadron was re-designated as 173rd Aviation Squadron when it transitioned to rotary aircraft. History On 17 February 1974, the 173rd General Support Squadron was formed as part of the 1st Aviation Regiment based at Oakey and initially operated 6 Pilatus PC-6 Porters. In 1978, the Squadron also received 11 GAF Nomad aircraft.. During this time, the Squadron undertook a variety of Army co-operation roles utilising the short take-off and landing characteristics of its aircraft. These included: artillery spotting, troop transport, field resupply, medevac, ground-air liaison. It was also used for survey work in the South Pacific and flood relief in Australia.. In 1978, the Squadron was involved in Operation Cenderawasih a mapping program in Irian Jaya in Indonesia with the Indonesian Army. With the retirement of the Porters in October 1992, the following year the Squadron adopted the title of \\"173rd Surveillance Squadron\\" under this guise it undertook the aerial surveillance and survey roles and was also used as a vehicle to deliver parachute troops. In 1993, it acquired 12 more Nomads, mainly unsold civilian variants which had been kept in storage, to replace the Porters. A King Air B350 at Kingsford Smith International Airport in 2006 In August 1995, following the fatal crashes involving Nomads from the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) and the School of Army Aviation, the aircraft were withdrawn from service. Most of the Nomad fleet was sold to the Indonesian Navy but two were retained as unflyable training aids. As a consequence, the Squadron operated 4 Embraer EMB 110P1 Bandeirante aircraft leased from Flight West Airlines temporarily while a replacement for the Nomad was found.. From 1996, these aircraft were replaced with 3 Beechcraft King Air B200 aircraft leased from Hawker Pacific to be based at Oakley and 3 de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter 320 aircraft leased from Hawker Pacific to be based in Darwin. On 9 November 1997, Twin Otter VH- HPY was lost in a tropical mountainous training accident in Papua New Guinea, resulting in serious injuries to the three trainees and instructor onboard. The Squadron served in several East Timor operations including INTERFET, UNTAET, UNMISET and Operation Astute. A Squadron King Air was the first ADF aircraft to land in Dili ahead of the INTERFET peace-keeping taskforce in 1999. By 2004, the remaining Twin Otter aircraft based in Darwin had been withdrawn from service, while the King Air B200 was replaced by the more modern King Air B350 variant leased from Hawker Pacific. Restructuring of Army's aviation capability saw the Squadron separated from 1st Aviation Regiment and placed under the command of 16th Aviation Brigade as an independent unit. By 2007, further re-organisation assigned all fixed-wing military aircraft to the RAAF and the Squadron was to relocate to Sydney as a helicopter training and surveillance squadron under the newly raised 6th Aviation Regiment. In March 2008, the Squadron became part of the 6th Aviation Regiment. On 20 November 2009, the Squadron handed the King Air over to the RAAF. On 11 February 2010, the Squadron was re-designated as the \\"173rd Aviation Squadron\\" converting to rotary aircraft based with the 171st Aviation Squadron at the recently redeveloped Luscombe Army Airfield operating a fleet of Bell 206B-1 Kiowa helicopters. The Kiowas were operated to provide training for graduate pilots unable to undertake operational conversions to the delayed MRH 90 Taipan and Tiger ARH helicopters. The Kiowa had been retired on 26 October 2009 from the 1st Aviation Regiment. In 2013, the Squadron transitioned to the Black Hawk helicopter with the role of providing support to the Special Operations Command and returned the Kiowa to the Army Aviation Training Centre at Oakey.

Economic significance Mackerel scad are fairly important both to fisheries and to sportfishing. They are a somewhat popular fish for human consumption, normally eaten split and fried, but are more often used as bait, since large gamefish such as the blue-spotted grouper, giant trevally, and the onespot snapper are all known to feed on them.Randall, J.E. and V.E.

Founded in 1951, it is a member of the Assemblies of God, a Pentecostal Christian denomination. The church gained national attention in 2008 when United States presidential candidate Senator John McCain chose Alaska Governor Sarah Palin, an attendee of the church until 2002, as his running mate in the 2008 election. History The church's founding pastor was Paul Riley. Originally meeting in the Wasilla Community Hall in 1951, the church purchased property and constructed a building that would be expanded and eventually house the church until the early 1980s when new land further down Knik- Goosebay Road was purchased and a new church built to accommodate growth. Around this time Tim McGraw succeeded Riley as pastor. McGraw served as pastor for 12 years before being succeeded by Ed Kalnins in 1999. Controversy Ed Kalnins After the 2008 nomination of Sarah Palin for Vice President of the United States, senior pastor Ed Kalnins' preaching was scrutinized by the media. His sermons were available on the church website. USA Today reported the Huffington Post assertion that \\"Kalnins has preached that critics of President Bush will be banished to hell; questioned whether people who voted for Sen. John Kerry in 2004 would be accepted into heaven; and preached that the Sept. 11 attacks and the war in Iraq were part of a world war over Christianity\\". Kalnins preached \\"I believe that Alaska is one of the refuge states... in the Last Days, and hundreds of thousands of people are going to come to this state to seek refuge. And the church has to ready to minister to them\\". In an interview cited by the Wall Street Journal, Kalnins clarified his remarks on the Iraq war, saying \\"I don't think it's God's will to have a war. But in Iraq, America is fighting an enemy that has made it a war over beliefs\\". The church also issued a statement clarifying the Kerry assertions, \\"Those who know our church and Pastor Ed know that we often say things in a humorous, tongue in cheek manner. We do realize the danger in that. This is the way in which Pastor Ed made the controversial remark. We do acknowledge in hindsight that it was careless, and we do apologize for that\\". Thomas Muthee Guest speaker Thomas Muthee's background, especially his accusations of witchcraft against a woman known as \\"Mama Jane\\", received a great deal of media attention. Muthee's sermons have also been scrutinized, especially during a 2005 appearance at the Wasilla Assembly of God during which he prayed for Sarah Palin, asking God to protect her from witchcraft and for God to supply people and financial resources for her then-campaign for Alaska governor. The Boston Herald described it as \\"all smoke and no fire\\", pointing out that some religious experts believed that, in light of Muthee's cultural background, there was nothing strange about the prayer. Sarah Palin Baptized in the church at the age of 12, Sarah Palin was an attendee until 2002. Speaking at the church in 2008, Palin asked congregants to \\"Pray for our military men and women who are striving to do what is right also for this country\\" and pray \\"that our national leaders are sending them out on a task that is from God. That's what we have to make sure we're praying for: that there is a plan and that plan is God's plan\\". Ministries Wasilla Assembly of God sponsors a youth group for girls in Kindergarten to 8th grade called the Missionettes. The youth group conducts several community service projects each year. The church hosts an annual Christian music concert called \\"Winter Rock Fest\\", which began in 2005, and now attracts over 1,000 youth each year. The church runs ministries providing help to poor neighborhoods, care for children in need, and general community services. In cooperation with Alaska Family Services, the Salvation Army, and other area churches, the Wasilla Assembly of God distributed baskets to 39 families in Wasilla during Thanksgiving of 2005. The church also supplies food to the annual free Thanksgiving meal hosted by Shema Christian Ministries. The church established a teen youth learning center called Rally Point in 2006. Rally Point is located in the church's original building at Knik-Goose Bay Road. The Master's Commission program is a live-in religious educational program for young adults. \\"To Know God and To Make Him Known\\" is the twofold purpose of Master's Commission discipleship ministry. The program is similar to other such programs at Assemblies of God congregations throughout the United States.

Early stages of the competition were run on a regional basis, however the structure of the competition was altered from previous years, largely due to the commencement of the New Zealand National Soccer League. Whereas in previous years qualification matches had been entirely run on a by-region basis culminating in two finals, one in each island, the draw from 1970 became more open, with regional qualifiers facing National League opposition in the final rounds. This led to several firsts for the competition, with Nelson United becoming the first South Island team to play a (pre-final) Chatham Cup match in the North Island, Western Suburbs FC becoming the first North Island team to play in Christchurch, and Stop Out being the first North Island team to play in Dunedin. Caversham was the only regional qualifier to make it as far as the semi-finals in the National League's first year, beating two league teams (Christchurch United and Stop Out) in the process. A further boost was given to the competition though Gillette, who became the Chatham Cup's first naming-rights sponsors. The competition was to be known as the Gillette Chatham Cup until 1974, when Lion Breweries took over sponsorship of the competition. p. 75 In all, 105 teams took part in the competition, with the eight National League teams being joined with a further 67 North Island and 30 South Island teams. In the National League's inaugural season, Blockhouse Bay became the first team to win the league and cup double. Note: Different sources give different numberings for the rounds of the competition: some start round one with the beginning of the regional qualifications; others start numbering from the first national knock-out stage. The former numbering scheme is used in this article. The 1970 final The final was the first all-North Island final, and was also the first final to require a replay. The replay was held in Auckland, making this first Chatham Cup final to be decided outside Wellington, and the first not to be decided at the Basin Reserve since 1927. The first match was memorable, and pitted favourites against underdogs. The two teams had both been in the first season of the national league, with Blockhouse Bay emerging as clear champions and Western Suburbs propping up the foot of the table with just one win from 14 league matches. It was the underdogs who had the makings of the trophy, however, leading by two Wayne Huntley goals with only a handful of minutes remaining. Between the 83rd and 86th minutes, however, Colin Shaw hit the target twice for the Bay, the second of the goals coming from a penalty which had to be retaken. Bay dominated the two periods of extra time, yet it was Suburbs who came closest to gaining the upper hand, hitting the woodwork on two occasions. The old rule of counting corners to decide the outcome of a tie had been scrapped and the idea of a penalty shootout had not yet been introduced, so the match headed to a replay. pp. 75-6 The rematch was a seesaw affair, with Bay leading twice only for Suburbs to equalise each time. With minutes remaining, Suburbs found what looked like the winning strike, but it was ruled out for offside. With seconds to go, it was Blockhouse Bay who finally tipped the scales. Goals in the match came from Clive Campbell, Iain Ormond and Colin Shaw for the Bay and Bruce Baker and Barry Humphreys for Suburbs. p. 76 Results Third Round * Won by Invercargill United on corners Fourth Round Fifth Round Sixth Round Quarter-finals * Blockhouse Bay won on corners Semi-finals Final =Replay= References *Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation New Zealand 1970 page *UltimateNZSoccer website 1970 Chatham Cup page Chatham Cup Chatham Cup Chatham Cup September 1970 sports events in Oceania ","title":"1970 Chatham Cup"},{"id":"19167177","text":"In mathematics, the maximum-minimums identity is a relation between the maximum element of a set S of n numbers and the minima of the 2n ‚àí 1 non-empty subsets of S.

During her tenure, there was a dramatic increase in commercial, trade and cultural ties between West Africa and India. These closer economic links have provided the impetus for India's trade with West Africa to grow to $40 billion by 2015. She led India's efforts to deepen engagement with West Africa through intensifying relations with Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), and enhancing co-operation in the area of oil and gas, education, pharmaceuticals, mining and infrastructure. As India's ambassador to Ivory Coast, she argued that capacity building is a major thrust of India's development co-operation with Africa. She advocated for the establishment of over a hundred professional training institutes across Africa, for which India allocated $700 million. Along with the former Minister of State for External Affairs Shashi Tharoor, she was responsible for gaining Liberian support for a permanent seat for India on the UN Security Council. In February 2010, Ambassador Jain and Indian Overseas Affairs Minister Vayalar Ravi met with a car accident during their diplomatic visit to Liberia. This occurred when a speeding driver rammed into their car in Monrovia. Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf went to the scene of the accident and arranged for them to be airlifted to Abidjan, Ivory Coast for further medical treatment.  Ivorian civil war  Despite facing grave danger, Shamma Jain oversaw the evacuation of Indian nationals in Ivory Coast who were caught in the Second Ivorian Civil War in March 2011. This coincided with India voting in the UN Security Council for sanctions against Laurent Gbagbo and close aides. Amidst heavy gunfire and explosions in the diplomatic area where her residence was located, Ambassador Jain remained in Abidjan to ensure the evacuation of several hundred members of the Indian community. On 8 April 2011, Jain had to be evacuated by French troops when her residence in Cocody, Abidjan was attacked by armed mercenaries. She had been trapped in her house, which was adjacent to Gbagbo's besieged presidential compound. This area witnessed the heaviest fighting in the capital between the opposing forces of incumbent Gbagbo and Alassane Ouattara. After many hours of being holed up in her residence, Ambassador Jain was safely evacuated in a daring operation by UN and French forces to a French military base outside Abidjan.

The current Minister of Foreign Affairs is Vladimir Makei, since 2012. History Historical lineage In December 1920, the People‚Äôs Commissariat for Foreign Affairs was established by resolution of the Second Congress of Soviets of Belarus. With the 1922 formation of the USSR, the functions of representing the Soviet republics in the international arena passed into the national jurisdiction. On 1 February 1944, the Supreme Soviet of the USSR adopted a law on giving the Union Republics powers in the field of foreign policy. The People‚Äôs Commissariat of Foreign Affairs of the Belarusian SSR was then established on 24 March that year as a direct result of a resolution passed by the Supreme Soviet. According to this law, the union republics received the right to enter into direct relations with foreign states, conclude agreements with them and exchange diplomatic and consular missions. The structure of the People's Commissariat included the political, protocol and consular departments, the personnel department and the administration of affairs. The staff of the People's Commissariat totaled 27 people. By decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of Belarus on 26 March 1946, the People‚Äôs Commissariat was transformed into the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Exactly 12 years later, the Council of Ministers gave the order for the ministry to represent the BSSR at the United Nations.http://www.mfa.gov.by/ministry/100years/ Modern era On 19 September 1991, it become known as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Belarus, effective on this day from a national law adopted at the extraordinary session of the Supreme Soviet. The ministry then became subordinate to the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Belarus. By a decree of President Alexander Lukashenko on 4 December 1998, the ministry was reorganized by abolishing three ministries: foreign affairs, CIS affairs and foreign economic relations. The new most recent regulation on the ministry was approved by decree in July 2006.

He belonged to both of the most important theatre companies of his generation, Queen Henrietta's Men and the King's Men.Edwin Nunzeger, A Dictionary of Actors and of Others Associated with the Public Representation of Plays in England Before 1642, New Haven, Yale University Press, 1929; pp. 3-4. Allen was a member of the Queen Henrietta's company through the main phase of its existence, from 1625 to 1636. Six cast lists for five plays survive for the company; Allen is one of only two men (the other being Michael Bowyer) who is included in all six lists. Allen played major roles: * Captain Landby in Shirley's The Wedding * Pandolph in Davenport's King John and Matilda * Grimaldi the Renegado in Massinger's The Renegado * Hannibal in Nabbes's Hannibal and Scipio * Mullisheg in Heywood's The Fair Maid of the West (both parts). The Queen Henrietta's company was disrupted and fractured by the long theatre closure from May 1636 to October 1637, due to a severe outbreak of bubonic plague. Allen was one of several members of the troupe who disappear from the surviving records in the later 1630s; he may have been among a quartet of Queen's actors who travelled to Dublin with James Shirley to work at the Werburgh Street Theatre there.Allan H.

Toilets can be with or without flushing water (flush toilet or dry toilet). They can be set up for a sitting posture or for a squatting posture (squat toilet). Flush toilets are usually connected to a sewer system in urban areas and to septic tanks in isolated areas. Dry toilets are connected to a pit, removable container, composting chamber, or other storage and treatment device. Toilets are commonly made of ceramic (porcelain), concrete, plastic, or wood. In private homes, the toilet, sink, bath, or shower may be in the same room. Another option is to have one room for body washing (bathroom) and another for the toilet and handwashing sink (toilet room). Public toilets consist of one or more toilets (and commonly urinals) which are available for use by the general public. Portable toilets or chemical toilets may be brought in for large and temporary gatherings. Historically, sanitation has been a concern from the earliest stages of human settlements. However, many poor households in developing countries use very basic, and often unhygienic toilets - and nearly one billion people have no access to a toilet at all, and are forced to do open defecation.WHO and UNICEF (2017) Progress on Drinking Water, Sanitation and Hygiene: 2017 Update and SDG Baselines. Geneva: World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children‚Äôs Fund (UNICEF), 2017 These issues can lead to the spread of diseases transmitted via the fecal-oral route or via water, such as cholera and diarrhea. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 6 therefore calls for \\"access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all and end open defecation\\".WHO and UNICEF (2017) Progress on Drinking Water, Sanitation and Hygiene: 2017 Update and SDG Baselines. Geneva: World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children‚Äôs Fund (UNICEF), 2017 Overview The number of different types of toilets used on a worldwide level is large. Toilet types can be grouped by: * Having a water seal or not (which usually relates to flushing or not, i.e. flush toilet versus dry toilet) * Being used in a sitting or squatting position (sitting toilet versus squat toilet) * Being located at a household level or in public (toilet room versus public toilet) People use different toilet types based on the country that they are in. In developing countries, access to toilets is also related to people's socio-economic status. Poor people in low-income countries often have no toilets at all and resort to open defecation instead. This is part of the sanitation crisis which international initiatives such as World Toilet Day draw attention to. With water as an odor seal Flush toilet Flush toilet bowl toilet flush sound A typical flush toilet is a ceramic bowl (pan) connected on the \\"up\\" side to a cistern (tank) that enables rapid filling with water, and on the \\"down\\" side to a drain pipe that removes the effluent. When a toilet is flushed, the sewage should flow into a septic tank or into a system connected to a sewage treatment plant. However, in many developing countries, this treatment step does not take place. The water in the toilet bowl is connected to a pipe shaped like an upside-down U. One side of the U channel is arranged as a siphon tube longer than the water in the bowl is high. The siphon tube connects to the drain. The bottom of the drain pipe limits the height of the water in the bowl before it flows down the drain. The water in the bowl acts as a barrier to sewer gas entering the building. Sewer gas escapes through a vent pipe attached to the sewer line. The amount of water used by conventional flush toilets usually makes up a significant portion of personal daily water usage. However, modern low flush toilet designs allow the use of much less water per flush. Dual flush toilets allow the user to select between a flush for urine or feces, saving a significant amount of water over conventional units. The flush handle on these toilets is pushed up for one kind of flush and down for the other. Another design is to have two buttons, one for urination and the other for defecation. In some places, users are encouraged not to flush after urination. Flushing toilets can be plumbed to use greywater (previously used for washing dishes, laundry, and bathing) rather than potable water (drinking water). Some modern toilets pressurize the water in the tank, which initiates flushing action with less water usage. Another variant is the pour-flush toilet. This type of flush toilet has no cistern but is flushed manually with a few liters of a small bucket. The flushing can use as little as . This type of toilet is common in many Asian countries. The toilet can be connected to one or two pits, in which case it is called a \\"pour flush pit latrine\\" or a \\"twin pit pour flush to pit latrine\\". It can also be connected to a septic tank. Flush toilets on ships are typically flushed with seawater. Vacuum toilet A vacuum toilet is a flush toilet that is connected to a vacuum sewer system, and removes waste by suction. They may use very little water (less than a quarter of a liter per flush) or none, (as in waterless urinals). Some flush with coloured disinfectant solution rather than with water. They may be used to separate blackwater and greywater, and process them separately (for instance, the fairly dry blackwater can be used for biogas production, or in a composting toilet). Passenger train toilets, aircraft lavatories, bus toilets, and ships with plumbing often use vacuum toilets. The lower water usage saves weight, and avoids water slopping out of the toilet bowl in motion. Aboard vehicles, a portable collection chamber is used; if it is filled by positive pressure from an intermediate vacuum chamber, it need not be kept under vacuum. Without water as an odor seal Pit latrines are still in use in rural areas of wealthy countries (Her√∏y, Norway) Many types of toilets without a water seal (also called dry toilets or \\"non-flush toilets\\") exist. These types of toilets do not use water as an odor seal or to move excreta along. For example, from simple to more complex: a bucket toilet (honey bucket), a tree bog or arborloo (two simple systems for converting excrement to direct fertiliser for trees), a pit latrine (a deep hole in the ground), a vault toilet (which keeps all the waste underground until it is pumped out), a container-based toilet, a composting toilet (which mixes excreta with carbon-rich materials for faster decomposition), a urine-diverting dry toilet (which keeps urine separate from feces), and incinerating and freezing toilets. Dry toilets use no water for flushing. They also do not produce wastewater. Some of these devices are high- tech but many are quite basic. Pit latrine with direct drop A poorly maintained pit latrine in Yaounde, Cameroon A simple pit latrine uses no water seal and collects human excreta in a pit or trench. The excreta drop directly into the pit via a drop hole. This type of toilet can range from a simple slit trench to more elaborate systems with seating or squatting pans and ventilation systems. In developed countries, they are associated with camping and wilderness areas. They are common in rural or peri-urban areas in many developing countries. Pit latrines are also used in emergency sanitation situations. The pit or trench can be dug large enough so that the pit can be used for many years before it fills up. When the pit becomes full, it may be emptied or the hole covered with earth and the pit latrine relocated. Pit latrines have to be located away from drinking water sources (wells, streams, etc.) to minimize the possibility of disease spread via groundwater pollution. A ventilation improved pit (VIP) latrine adds certain design features to the simple pit latrine which reduces flies from exiting the latrine, thereby reducing the spread of diseases. Vault toilet A vault toilet is a non- flush toilet with a sealed container (or vault) buried in the ground to receive the excreta, all of which is contained underground until it is removed by pumping. A vault toilet is distinguished from a pit latrine because the waste accumulates in the vault instead of seeping into the underlying soil. Urine-diverting dry toilet Urine diversion toilets have two compartments, one for urine and one for feces. A urine-diverting dry toilet uses no water for flushing and keeps urine and feces separate. It can be linked to systems which reuse excreta as a fertilizer. Portable toilet A line of portable toilets Portable toilet on top of a mountain in China The portable toilet is used on construction sites, film locations, and large outdoor gatherings where there are no other facilities. They are typically self-contained units that are made to be easily moved. Most portable toilets are unisex single units with privacy ensured by a simple lock on the door. The units are usually lightweight and easily transported by a flatbed truck and loaded and unloaded by a small forklift. Many portable toilets are small molded plastic or fiberglass portable rooms with a lockable door and a receptacle to catch waste in a chemically treated container. If used for an extended period of time, they have to be cleaned out and new chemicals put in the waste receptacle. For servicing multiple portable toilets, tanker trucks (vacuum trucks or honeywagons) are equipped with large vacuums to evacuate the waste and replace the chemicals. Portable toilets can also be urine-diverting dry toilets. A bucket toilet, also known as a honey bucket, is a very simple type of portable toilet. Chemical toilet Chemical toilets collect human excreta in a holding tank and use chemicals to minimize odors. They do not require a connection to a water supply and are used in a variety of situations. Aircraft lavatories and passenger train toilets were in the past often designed as chemical toilets but are nowadays more likely to be vacuum toilets. Types by usage posture Toilets can be designed to be used either in a sitting or in a squatting posture. Toilet with a pedestal for sitting Sitting toilets are often referred to as \\"western-style toilets\\".Gershenson, Olga; Penner, Barbara (2009): Ladies and gents - Public toilets and gender. Temple University Press, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Sitting toilets are more convenient than squat toilets for people with disabilities and the elderly. Squat toilet A squat toilet (also called \\"squatting toilet\\", \\"natural position toilet\\", or by many national names) is a toilet of any technology type (i.e. pit latrine, urine-diverting dry toilet, flush toilet etc.) which is used in a squatting position rather than sitting. This means that the defecation posture used is to place one foot on each side of the toilet drain or hole and to squat over it. Squatting toilets are the norm in many Asian and African countries, and are common in most Muslim countries. They are also occasionally found in some European and South American countries. In 1976, squatting toilets were said to be used by the majority of the world's population.Kira A. The Bathroom. Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1976, revised edition, pp.115,116. However, there is a general trend in many countries to move from squatting toilets to sitting toilets (particularly in urban areas) as the latter are often regarded as more modern.von M√ºnch, E.; Milosevic, D. (2015): Qualitative survey on squatting toilets and anal cleansing with water with a special emphasis on Muslim and Buddhist countries by using the SuSanA discussion forum. Ostella Consulting, Schwalbach, Germany Usage Urination There are cultural differences in socially accepted and preferred voiding positions for urination around the world: in the Middle East and Asia, the squatting position is more prevalent, while in the Western world the standing and sitting position are more common. Anal cleansing habits In the Western world, the most common method of cleaning the anal area after defecation is by toilet paper or sometimes by using a bidet. In many Muslim countries, the facilities are designed to enable people to follow Islamic toilet etiquette '. For example, a bidet shower may be plumbed in. The left hand is used for cleansing, for which reason that hand is considered impolite or polluted in many Asian countries. There are toilets on the market where the seats have integrated spray mechanisms for anal and genital water sprays (see for example Toilets in Japan). This can be useful for the elderly or people with disabilities.  Accessible toilets  An accessible toilet is designed to accommodate people with physical disabilities, such as age related limited mobility or inability to walk due to impairments. Additional measures to add toilet accessibility are providing more space and grab bars to ease transfer to and from the toilet seat, including enough room for a caregiver if necessary. Public toilet A public toilet is accessible to the general public. It may be municipally owned or managed, entered directly from the street. It may be within a building that, while privately owned, allows public access, such as a department store, or it may be limited to the business's customers, such as a restaurant. If its use requires a fee, it is also called a pay toilet. Depending on the culture, there may be varying degrees of separation between men and women and different levels of privacy. Typically, the entire room, or a stall or cubicle containing a toilet, is lockable. Urinals, if present in a men's toilet is typically mounted on a wall with or without a divider between them. In the most basic form, a public toilet maybe not much more than an open latrine. Another form is a street urinal known as a pissoir, after the French term. Public health aspects Toilets should be innovated and \\"reinvented\\" to properly address the global sanitation crisis says the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation To this day, 1 billion people in developing countries have no toilets in their homes and are resorting to Open defecation instead. The Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) for Water Supply and Sanitation by WHO and UNICEF is the official United Nations mechanism tasked with monitoring progress towards the Millennium Development Goal relating to drinking-water and sanitation (MDG 7, Target 7c). One target of this goal is to: \\"Halve, by 2015, the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking-water and basic sanitation\\" and publishes figures on access to sanitation worldwide on a regular basis.WHO and UNICEF Progress on Sanitation and Drinking-water: 2013 Update , WHO, Geneva and UNICEF, New York Another organization which focuses on toilet and sanitation is the World Toilet Organization which has its founding date, November 19, used for the UN's International World Toilet Day. Toilets are one important element of a sanitation system, although other elements are also needed: transport, treatment, disposal, or reuse. Diseases, including Cholera, which still affects some 3 million people each year, can be largely prevented when effective sanitation and water treatment prevents fecal matter from contaminating waterways, groundwater, and drinking water supplies. Example of cholera in England There have been five main cholera outbreaks and pandemics since 1825. In London alone, the second killed 14,137 people in 1849, and the third took 10,738 lives in 1853‚Äì54. In 1849 the English physician John Snow published a paper On the Mode of Communication of Cholera, in which he suggested that cholera might be waterborne. During the 1854 epidemic, he collected and analyzed data establishing that people who drank water from contaminated sources such as the Broad Street pump died of cholera at much higher rates than those who got water elsewhere. Toilets in developing countries Flying toilet A bucket toilet A \\"flying toilet\\" is a facetious name for a plastic bag that is used as a container for excrement and are then simply discarded. Associated especially with slums, they are called flying toilets \\"because when you have filled them, you throw them as far away as you can\\".Whitaker, Mark. 30 June 2007. \\"Why Uganda hates the plastic bag.\\" BBC News via news.bbc.co.uk. Retrieved on 28 September 2007. Floating toilet A floating toilet is essentially a toilet on a platform built above or floating on the water. Instead of excreta going into the ground they are collected in a tank or barrel. To reduce the amount of excreta that needs to hauled to shore, many use urine diversion. The floating toilet was developed for residents without quick access to land or connection to a sewer systems.\\"Sample Designs: Floating UDD Toilets\\". Asian Development Bank.

Toilet connected to livestock or aquaculture The pig toilet, which consists of a toilet linked to a pigsty by a chute, is still in use to a limited extent.Environmental History of Water, p.40 It was common in rural China, and was known in Japan, Korea, and India. The \\"fish pond toilet\\" depends on the same principle, of livestock (often carp) eating human excreta directly. History Ancient history Roman public toilets, Ostia Antica. toilet with pigsty, China, Eastern Han dynasty 25 ‚Äì 220 AD The 4th millennium BCE would witness the invention of clay pipes, sewers, and toilets, in Mesopotamia, with the city of Uruk today exhibiting the earliest known internal pit toilet, from c.3200 BCE. The Neolithic village of Skara Brae contains examples, c.3000 BCE, of internal small rooms over a communal drain, rather than pit. The Indus Valley Civilisation in northwestern India and Pakistan was home to the world's first known urban sanitation systems. In Mohenjo-Daro (c. 2800 BC), toilets were built into the outer walls of homes. These toilets had vertical chutes, via which waste was disposed of into cesspits or street drains.Teresi et al. 2002 Another typical example is the Indus city of Lothal (c. 2350 BCE). In Lothal all houses had their own private toilet which was connected to a covered sewer network constructed of brickwork held together with a gypsum-based mortar that emptied either into the surrounding water bodies or alternatively into cesspits, the latter of which were regularly emptied and cleaned. The Indus Valley Civilization also had water-cleaning toilets that used flowing water in each house that were linked with drains covered with burnt clay bricks. The flowing water removed the human waste. The Indus Valley civilisation had a network of sewers built under grid pattern streets. Other very early toilets that used flowing water to remove the waste are found at Skara Brae in Orkney, Scotland, which was occupied from about 3100 BC until 2500 BC. Some of the houses there have a drain running directly beneath them, and some of these had a cubicle over the drain. Around the 18th century BC, toilets started to appear in Minoan Crete, Pharaonic Egypt, and ancient Persia. In 2012, archaeologists found what is believed to be Southeast Asia's earliest latrine during the excavation of a neolithic village in the R·∫°ch N√∫i archaeological site, southern Vietnam. The toilet, dating back 1500 BC, yielded important clues about early Southeast Asian society. More than 30 coprolites, containing fish and shattered animal bones, provided information on the diet of humans and dogs, and on the types of parasites each had to contend with.Old toilet find offers civilization start clues.

In Roman civilization, latrines using flowing water were sometimes part of public bath houses. Roman latrines, like the ones pictured here, are commonly thought to have been used in the sitting position. The Roman toilets were probably elevated to raise them above open sewers which were periodically \\"flushed\\" with flowing water, rather than elevated for sitting. Romans and Greeks also used chamber pots, which they brought to meals and drinking sessions.Mattelaer, Johan J. \\"Some Historical Aspects of Urinals and Urine Receptacles.\\" World Journal of Urology 17.3 (1999): 145‚Äì50. Print. Johan J. Mattelaer said, \\"Plinius has described how there were large receptacles in the streets of cities such as Rome and Pompeii into which chamber pots of urine were emptied. The urine was then collected by fullers.\\" (Fulling was a vital step in textile manufacture.) The Han dynasty in China two thousand years ago used pig toilets. Post- classical history Garderobes were toilets used in the Post-classical history, most commonly found in upper-class dwellings. Essentially, they were flat pieces of wood or stone spanning from one wall to the other, with one or more holes to sit on. These were above chutes or pipes that discharged outside the castle or Manor house.Genc, Melda. \\"The Evolution of Toilets and Its Current State.\\" Thesis. Middle East Technical University, 2009.

The other main way of handling toilet needs was the chamber pot, a receptacle, usually of ceramic or metal, into which one would excrete waste. This method was used for hundreds of years; shapes, sizes, and decorative variations changed throughout the centuries.Powell, Christine A. \\"Port Royal Chamberpots Introduction.\\" Nautical Archaeology at Texas A&M; University. Texas A&M; University, 1 Dec. 1996. Web. 28 Nov. 2011. Chamber pots were in common use in Europe from ancient times, even being taken to the Middle East by medieval pilgrims. Modern history Bourdaloue chamber pots from the Austrian Imperial household Early 18th century British three-seat privy 19th century thunderbox, a heavy wooden commode to enclose chamber pot By the Early Modern era, chamber pots were frequently made of china or copper and could include elaborate decoration. They were emptied into the gutter of the street nearest to the home. In pre- modern Denmark, people generally defecated on farmland or other places where the human waste could be collected as fertilizer. The Old Norse language had several terms for referring to outhouses, including gar√∞h√∫s (yard house), n√°√∞-/n√°√∞a-h√∫s (house of rest), and annat h√∫s (the other house). In general, toilets were functionally non-existent in rural Denmark until the 18th century. By the 16th century, cesspits and cesspools were increasingly dug into the ground near houses in Europe as a means of collecting waste, as urban populations grew and street gutters became blocked with the larger volume of human waste. Rain was no longer sufficient to wash away waste from the gutters. A pipe connected the latrine to the cesspool, and sometimes a small amount of water washed waste through. Cesspools were cleaned out by tradesmen, known in English as gong farmers, who pumped out liquid waste, then shovelled out the solid waste and collected it during the night. This solid waste, euphemistically known as nightsoil, was sold as fertilizer for agricultural production (similarly to the closing-the-loop approach of ecological sanitation). The garderobe was replaced by the privy midden and pail closet in early industrial Europe. In the early 19th century, public officials and public hygiene experts studied and debated sanitation for several decades. The construction of an underground network of pipes to carry away solid and liquid waste was only begun in the mid 19th-century, gradually replacing the cesspool system, although cesspools were still in use in some parts of Paris into the 20th century. Even London, at that time the world's largest city, did not require indoor toilets in its building codes until after the First World War. The water closet, with its origins in Tudor times, started to assume its currently known form, with an overhead cistern, s-bends, soil pipes and valves around 1770. This was the work of Alexander Cumming and Joseph Bramah. Water closets only started to be moved from outside to inside of the home around 1850. The integral water closet started to be built into middle-class homes in the 1860s and 1870s, firstly on the principal bedroom floor and in larger houses in the maids' accommodation, and by 1900 a further one in the hallway. A toilet would also be placed outside the back door of the kitchen for use by gardeners and other outside staff such as those working with the horses. The speed of introduction was varied, so that in 1906 the predominantly working class town of Rochdale had 750 water closets for a population of 10,000. The working-class home had transitioned from the rural cottage, to the urban back- to-back terraces with external rows of privies, to the through terraced houses of the 1880 with their sculleries and individual external WC. It was the Tudor Walters Report of 1918 that recommended that semi-skilled workers should be housed in suburban cottages with kitchens and internal WC. As recommended floor standards waxed and waned in the building standards and codes, the bathroom with a water closet and later the low-level suite, became more prominent in the home. Before the introduction of indoor toilets, it was common to use the chamber pot under one's bed at night and then to dispose of its contents in the morning. During the Victorian era, British housemaids collected all of the household's chamber pots and carried them to a room known as the housemaids' cupboard. This room contained a \\"slop sink\\", made of wood with a lead lining to prevent chipping china chamber pots, for washing the \\"bedroom ware\\" or \\"chamber utensils\\". Once running water and flush toilets were plumbed into British houses, servants were sometimes given their own lavatory downstairs, separate from the family lavatory. The practice of emptying one's own chamber pot, known as slopping out, continued in British prisons until as recently as 2014 and was still in use in 85 cells in the Republic of Ireland in July 2017. With rare exceptions, chamber pots are no longer used. Modern related implements are bedpans and commodes, used in hospitals and the homes of invalids. =Development of dry earth closets= Henry Moule's earth closet design, circa 1909 Before the widespread adoption of the flush toilet, there were inventors, scientists, and public health officials who supported the use of \\"dry earth closets\\" - nowadays known either as dry toilets or composting toilets. =Development of flush toilets= Although a precursor to the flush toilet system which is widely used nowadays was designed in 1596 by John Harington, such systems did not come into widespread use until the late nineteenth century. With the onset of the industrial revolution and related advances in technology, the flush toilet began to emerge into its modern form. A crucial advance in plumbing, was the S-trap, invented by the Scottish mechanic Alexander Cummings in 1775, and still in use today. This device uses the standing water to seal the outlet of the bowl, preventing the escape of foul air from the sewer. It was only in the mid-19th century, with growing levels of urbanisation and industrial prosperity, that the flush toilet became a widely used and marketed invention. This period coincided with the dramatic growth in the sewage system, especially in London, which made the flush toilet particularly attractive for health and sanitation reasons. Flush toilets were also known as \\"water closets\\", as opposed to the earth closets described above. WCs first appeared in Britain in the 1880s, and soon spread to Continental Europe. In America, the chain-pull indoor toilet was introduced in the homes of the wealthy and in hotels in the 1890s. William Elvis Sloan invented the Flushometer in 1906, which used pressurized water directly from the supply line for faster recycle time between flushes. =High-tech toilet= \\"High-tech\\" toilets, which can be found in countries like Japan, include features such as automatic-flushing mechanisms; water jets or \\"bottom washers\\"; blow dryers, or artificial flush sounds to mask noises. Others include medical monitoring features such as urine and stool analysis and the checking of blood pressure, temperature, and blood sugar. Some toilets have automatic lid operation, heated seats, deodorizing fans, or automated replacement of paper toilet-seat-covers. Interactive urinals have been developed in several countries, allowing users to play video games. The \\"Toylet\\", produced by Sega, uses pressure sensors to detect the flow of urine and translates that into on-screen action. Astronauts on the International Space Station use a space toilet with urine diversion which can recover potable water.

She is doing her toilet, with her silver-gilt toilet service on the dressing-table Toilet was originally a French loanword (first attested in 1540) that referred to the ' (\\"little cloth\\") draped over one's shoulders during hairdressing.. During the late 17th century, the term came to be used by metonymy in both languages for the whole complex of grooming and body care that centered at a dressing table (also covered by a cloth) and for the equipment composing a toilet service, including a mirror, hairbrushes, and containers for powder and makeup. The time spent at such a table also came to be known as one's \\"toilet\\"; it came to be a period during which close friends or tradesmen were received as \\"toilet-calls\\". The use of \\"toilet\\" to describe a special room for grooming came much later (first attested in 1819), following the French '. Similar to \\"powder room\\", \\"toilet\\" then came to be used as a euphemism for rooms dedicated to urination and defecation, particularly in the context of signs for public toilets, as on trains. Finally, it came to be used for the plumbing fixtures in such rooms (apparently first in the United States) as these replaced chamber pots, outhouses, and latrines. These two uses, the fixture and the room, completely supplanted the other senses of the word during the 20th century except in the form \\"toiletries\\". Contemporary use The word \\"toilet\\" was by etymology a euphemism, but is no longer understood as such. As old euphemisms have become the standard term, they have been progressively replaced by newer ones, an example of the euphemism treadmill at work.\\"The honest Jakes or Privy has graduated via Offices to the final horror of Toilet\\" ‚Äì Vicar Bell, The choice of word relies not only on regional variation, but also on social situation and level of formality (register) or social class. American manufacturers show an uneasiness with the word and its class attributes: American Standard, the largest firm, sells them as \\"toilets\\", yet the higher priced products of the Kohler Company, often installed in more expensive housing, are sold as commodes or closets, words which also carry other meanings. Confusingly, products imported from Japan such as TOTO are referred to as \\"toilets\\", even though they carry the cachet of higher cost and quality. (Toto, an abbreviation of T≈çy≈ç T≈çki (Êù±Ê¥ãÈô∂Âô® Oriental Ceramics), is used in Japanese comics to visually indicate toilets or other things that look like toilets; see Toilets in Japan.) Regional variants Different dialects use \\"bathroom\\" and \\"restroom\\" (American English), \\"bathroom\\" and \\"washroom\\" (Canadian English), and \\"WC\\" (an initialism for \\"water closet\\"), \\"lavatory\\" and its abbreviation \\"lav\\" (British English). Euphemisms for the toilet that bear no direct reference to the activities of urination and defecation are ubiquitous in modern Western languages, reflecting a general attitude of unspeakability about such bodily function. These euphemistic practices appear to have become pronounced following the emergence of European colonial practices, which frequently denigrated colonial subjects in Africa, Asia and South America as 'unclean'.Alison Moore, Colonial Visions of ‚ÄòThird World‚Äô Toilets: A Nineteenth-Century Discourse That Haunts Contemporary Tourism. In Olga Gershenson and Barbara Penner (eds.), Ladies and Gents: Public Toilets and Gender (Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 2009), 97-113. Euphemisms \\"Crapper\\" was already in use as a coarse name for a toilet, but it gained currency from the work of Thomas Crapper, who popularized flush toilets in England. \\"The Jacks\\" is Irish slang for toilet. It perhaps derives from \\"jacques\\" and \\"jakes\\", an old English term. \\"Loo\\" ‚Äì The etymology of loo is obscure. The Oxford English Dictionary notes the 1922 appearance of \\"How much cost? Waterloo. Watercloset.\\" in James Joyce's novel Ulysses and defers to Alan S. C. Ross's arguments that it derived in some fashion from the site of Napoleon's 1815 defeat... In the 1950s the use of the word \\"loo\\" was considered one of the markers of British upper-class speech, featuring in a famous essay, \\"U and non-U English\\".. \\"Loo\\" may have derived from a corruption of French ' (\\"water\\"), ' (\\"mind the water\\", used in reference to emptying chamber pots into the street from an upper-story window), ' (\\"place\\"), ' (\\"place of ease\\", used euphemistically for a toilet), or ' (\\"English place\\", used from around 1770 to refer to English-style toilets installed for travelers).. Other proposed etymologies include a supposed tendency to place toilets in room 100 (hence \\"loo\\") in English hotels,. a dialectical corruption of the nautical term \\"lee\\" in reference to the need to urinate and defecate with the wind prior to the advent of head pumps, or the 17th-century preacher Louis Bourdaloue, whose long sermons at Paris's Saint-Paul-Saint-Louis prompted his parishioners to bring along chamber pots.

Formed in April 1942, when the Australian First Army was formed from the Australian I Corps after it returned from the Middle East, it was responsible for planning and directing all operations within the territory up until October 1944. General Headquarters Southwest Pacific Area Operational Instruction No.7 of 25 May 1942, issued by Commander- Allied-Forces, General Douglas MacArthur, placed all Australian and US Army, Air Force and Navy Forces in the Port Moresby Area under the control of New Guinea Force. Over the course of its existence, New Guinea Force was commanded by some of the Australian Army's most notable commanders, including Sydney Rowell, Sir Edmund Herring and Sir Leslie Morshead. General Sir Thomas Blamey also commanded the force in 1942 while based in Port Moresby. History alt=8th Military District, showing Territory of Papua and Territory of New Guinea (including the New Hebrides).At the outbreak of hostilities, Australia did not have forces in place for the defence of New Guinea and the New Hebrides, due to the League of Nations mandate under which the former German territories were administered. Small, mostly ad hoc units of lightly trained men were spread across the region. The Australian Government made the decision to move small units to strategic locations to assist the defence. This included elements of the 7th Division, consisting mainly of men from the 2/6th Field Company, on the transport Orcades, who were sent to Java, and fought alongside Dutch forces there, but like most other minor garrisons were soon overwhelmed. Prior to the formation of New Guinea Force, in January 1942, the 30th Brigade was deployed to New Guinea arriving on the troopship RMS Aquitania, with the 39th and 53rd Infantry Battalions, and took command of the 49th Infantry Battalion. Initially, all Australian forces in New Guinea had been part of the 8th Military District; however, in April 1942, an Army-wide reorganisation was undertaken which saw the establishment of a new command ‚Äì New Guinea Force ‚Äì with Major General Basil Morris in command. This force subsequently replaced the 8th Military District as the formation responsible for all Australian forces in the territories of Papua and New Guinea. In August 1942, HQ I Corps was transferred from Queensland to Port Moresby and on 15 August 1942 became known as Headquarters New Guinea Force (HQ NG Force). Corps troops and two brigades of 7th Division subsequently moved in. Upon arrival, the 21st Brigade, under Brigadier Arnold Potts, was dispatched to Port Moresby, from where they would help reinforce the 39th Battalion, which were fighting a rearguard action on the Kokoda Track. Around the same time, the 18th Brigade, under the command of Brigadier George Wootten, was sent to Milne Bay, to reinforce the 7th Brigade, which was defending the airfield at the eastern tip of Papua, supported by the Royal Australian Air Force and US engineers. The fighting which followed came to be known as the Battle of Milne Bay. Further formations from I Corps were rotated through the New Guinea theatre of operations under the command of New Guinea Force: * In April 1942, the 3rd Division had been assigned to the Australian I Corps, and in early 1943 the 3rd Division arrived in New Guinea, with the 15th Brigade being sent to Port Moresby and the 4th Brigade going to Milne Bay. * In August 1943, the 5th Division arrived in New Guinea with the 29th Brigade. The 4th Brigade of the 3rd Division was reassigned to the 5th Division and was later replaced within the division by the 29th Brigade. * From January to May 1944, the brigades of the 7th Division returned to Australia. * In August 1944, the 3rd Division's brigades were withdrawn back to Australia and assigned to the Australian II Corps. Major engagements The subsequent major engagements were fought by units under New Guinea Force: Milne Bay: August ‚Äì September 1942 While Australian forces were fighting a rearguard action on the Kokoda Track to prevent the Japanese from reaching Port Moresby, the 4th Brigade of the 3rd Division was sent to Milne Bay in April 1942 to assist protect and expand the airfield there, in anticipation of the creation of an amphibious force to defend the coastal approaches to Milne Bay and Port Moresby. Construction of the airstrip commenced on 8 June 1942, with Nos. 76 and 75 Squadrons arriving in late July. In late August, a Japanese amphibious force attacked in an effort to capture the airfield, but miscalculated the number of Allied troops and were eventually pushed back into the sea and forced to retreat the following month. This was the first major defeat of Japanese land forces in the region. Kokoda: July ‚Äì November 1942 In late-September, 1942, the Australian forces began pushing the Japanese back toward Buna. The retreat of the Japanese forces quickly became a rout, with many falling to starvation, illness and the environment, as well as Australian attacks. Buna‚ÄìGona: November 1942 ‚Äì January 1943 After a disastrous start by the inexperienced US 32nd Infantry Division, the advance was restarted by the Australian 7th Division, with Gona falling in December 1942, Buna in January 1943, and Sanananda (between the two larger villages) later that same month. Wau: January 1943 Despite achieving tactical surprise by approaching from an unexpected direction, after a trek over the mountains from Lae, the Japanese attackers were unable to capture Wau, as the Australian defenders had been greatly reinforced by air. Salamaua-Lae: April - September 1943 After the successful defence of Wau, which was followed up by an advance towards Mubo, a series of actions followed over the course of several months as the Australian 3rd Division advanced north-east towards Salamaua, including an amphibious landing at Nassau Bay. Keeping up the pressure around Salamaua, in early September they launched an airborne assault on Nadzab (see below), and a seaborne landing near Lae (see below), taking the town with simultaneous drives from the east and north-west. The Salamaua garrison withdrew, and it was captured on 11 September 1943, while Lae fell shortly afterwards on 16 September. Battle of Mubo: March - July 1943 Landing at Nassau Bay: August 1943 Landing at Nadzab: September 1943 Landing at Lae: September 1943 Overview Mission alt=Three men in shorts, wearing steel helmets but one is shirtless.

The mission of the \\"NEW GUINEA FORCE\\" is :(a) Protect the operation of Allied Air Forces operating from and through air bases in AUSTRALIAN NEW GUINEA. :(b) Prevent further hostile penetration into AUSTRALIAN NEW GUINEA and in conjunction with the Allied Air Forces, maintain active reconnaissance and deny Japanese use of sea and land areas adjacent to PORT MORESBY, MILNE BAY and the island groups to the north and southeastward of the latter. Prevent at all costs penetration of the Japanese to the southeastward of the crest of the OWEN STANLEY RANGE. :(c) Maintain active patrol operations across the OWEN STANLEY RANGE in the direction of LAE‚ÄîSALAMAUA and BUNA-GONA. Prepare at the earliest practicable date, assisted by transport and other aviation of the Allied Air Forces, a striking force of at least two battalions eastward of the crest of the OWEN STANLEY RANGE along the route, PORT MORESBY-KOKODA, and capture the KOKODA aerodrome. The eventual objective of this force, upon later orders from this headquarters, in conjunction with other forces is to capture the BUNA-GONA area. Maintain and augment present forces operating from the vicinity of WAU and BULOLO, continue harassing attacks against and be prepared in conjunction with other forces, on later orders from this headquarters, to assist in the capture of LAE and SALAMAUA. :(d) Develop at the earliest practicable date in the vicinity of MILNE BAY an amphibious force, equipped with small boats, for coastwise operations. With the amphibious force and overland detachment, and in conjunction with Allied Air Forces, operate along the northeast coast of NEW GUINEA with the objective of securing the coast line from EAST CAPE to TUFI inclusive and be prepared, in conjunction with other forces upon later orders from this headquarters, to assist in the capture of the BUNA-GONA area. Order of battle Over the course of the force's existence, its order of battle changed a number of times as various divisions and brigades were force assigned or reallocated.

Origin  The Great Lakes Greyhound Lines (GL) resulted from a combination of three major components: the Eastern Michigan Motorbuses, the Ohio Greyhound Lines, and the Michigan routes of the Central Greyhound Lines (a subsidiary of The Greyhound Corporation with the second use of the name of the Central Greyhound Lines). That third source, the (second) Central GL, is of particular historical interest, because it had descended from, among other elements, the Safety Motor Coach Lines, in which Edwin Eckstrom, an early investor and participant in the Greyhound development in northern Minnesota, first applied the name Greyhound (albeit in a borrowed usage) to the coaches and the companies and first applied the blue-and-white livery to the coaches.  Eastern Michigan Motorbuses  In 1924 the Detroit United Railway (DUR) Company, an electric interurban rail carrier, formed a highway- coach subsidiary, then named as the People's Motor Coach (PMC) Company, to enable its parent firm to reduce its operating costs and to enhance its competitive position against an increasing number of rivals operating buses on the improving roads. [The DUR Company had already become involved in the first of its two bankruptcies and reorganizations.] During the following years the PMC Company developed an extensive bus system, mostly by the acquisition of pre-existing smaller companies, operating along both suburban and intercity routes. In one notable event, late in 1924 the DUR Company bought the Detroit- Toledo Transportation Company from Ralph A.L. Bogan, another original busman from northern Minnesota. Bogan (along with Swan Sundstrom, another early driver in Hibbing, Minnesota, and elsewhere) had (in 1923) used the brand name, trade name, or service name of the Blue Goose Lines, as he had previously used the same brand name for one other bus company (the Gray Motor Stage Line, running in Wisconsin, between Janesville and Watertown) and later (in 1925) used it again for a third firm (running in Indiana, from Indianapolis southward to Evansville and northward to Kokomo and soon onward to Fort Wayne). The DUR Company extended the name of the Blue Goose Lines (and the image of a blue goose) to its entire intercity system. Eventually all three of those Bogan routes became segments of the growing Greyhound route network; Bogan himself continued as a key player at Greyhound, serving eventually as the vice president during the presidency of Orville Swan Caesar (1946‚Äì56) of The Greyhound Corporation, after the retirement of Carl Eric Wickman, the principal founder of Greyhound. [Sundstrom later became the president of the Pennsylvania GL.] Other acquired firms included the White Star Motorbus Company, the Wolverine Transit Company, the Star Motor Coach Line, and the Highway Motorbus Company. The DUR Company in 1928 became renamed as the Eastern Michigan (EM) Railways, and the PMC Company, its highway-coach subsidiary, in 1928 became likewise renamed as the Eastern Michigan Motorbuses (EMM); then in -31 the EM Railways went into the second (and final) bankruptcy and reorganization. The renamed EMM continued to acquire other firms, including the Southern Michigan Transportation Company, the Great Lakes Motor Bus Company, and the Grosse Ile Rapid Transit Company (which had begun in 1919 as the Grosse Ile Transportation Company). Despite the lack of success of the parent EM Railways, by 1938 the subsidiary EM Motorbuses had become the largest intrastate bus company in the Wolverine State. Then The Greyhound Corporation, the parent Greyhound firm, bought a controlling (majority) interest in the EMM under the supervision of the receivers (and the court) in bankruptcy. However, the federal Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) did not at first allow Greyhound to exercise control over the EMM or to merge it into Greyhound, not until 1941, after a change in the membership of the ICC. Because of the large size of the EMM, its route network, and its operations, The Greyhound Corporation created a new subsidiary, named as the Great Lakes Greyhound Lines, which in 1941 took over the EMM.  Ohio Greyhound Lines  In 1941, when the Great Lakes GL came into existence, The Greyhound Corporation merged the Ohio GL into the new Great Lakes GL. The Ohio GL had run between Detroit and Louisville (in Kentucky) via Toledo, Dayton, and Cincinnati (all three in Ohio), plus along a detached route between Evansville and Indianapolis (both in Indiana). [The route segment between Louisville and Cincinnati had come from the Southland Transportation Company, which Harris Spearin, with the backing and financing of Wickman in Minnesota, had founded in 1925, after (in 1923) he sold his White Bus Lines, running three routes based in Duluth, Minnesota, to Wickman's Mesaba Motors Company (a predecessor of the Motor Transit Corporation, which in 1929 became renamed as The Greyhound Corporation ‚Äì with an uppercase T, because the word \\"the\\" was an integral part of the legal name of the corporate entity).] To comply with an Indiana statute (one which required that corporations doing business in the Hoosier State be domiciled there), Greyhound created a paper administrative corporation, based in Indiana and named as the Great Lakes Greyhound Lines of Indiana, to conduct the route between Evansville and Indianapolis. [The Ohio GL (running 1935-41) had likewise been based in Indiana, as had been the predecessor Central GL (1930‚Äì35), which had made the first use of the name of the Central Greyhound Lines, and as had been the earlier predecessor Greyhound Lines, Inc., GLI, of Indiana, which (in 1927) had started Greyhound service between Chicago (in Illinois) and Indianapolis, and which had made the first use of the name of the Greyhound Lines.] In 1928 the Motor Transit Corporation (MTC), before it became renamed as The Greyhound Corporation, bought the Detroit and Cincinnati Coach Lines, using the brand name, trade name, or service name of the Sunny South Lines, running between those two named cities, thereby gaining the major part of the Greyhound route between Detroit and Louisville. [The seller of the Sunny South Lines was Walter Nisun, who had founded it, and who later (about 1934) sold to the Pennsylvania GL another of his properties, running between Detroit and Saint Louis (in Missouri) via Fort Wayne and Indianapolis.] [In 1930, during the formation of the Pennsylvania GL, The Greyhound Corporation transferred the routes of the GLI of Indiana - to the Pennsylvania GL and to another new subsidiary, named originally as the (first) Central GL. The Pennsylvania GL got the routes paralleling and coinciding with those of the Pennsylvania Railroad, which made a minority investment in the Pennsylvania GL, and the (first) Central GL got the other routes of the GLI of Indiana (that is, the ones between Indianapolis and Evansville and between Detroit and Louisville).] [The (first) Central GL in 1935 became renamed (as the Ohio GL) to allow Greyhound to reassign the name Central to a different subsidiary, in the Midwest and the Northeast, one which coincided with the territory of another major railway company, the New York Central (NYC) System, one in which Greyhound transferred a minority non-voting interest to the NYC System, the subsidiary which the Greyhound executives wished to bear a name (Central) to suggest the relationship with the related railway firm (New York Central), as in the case of the neighboring Pennsylvania GL and the Pennsylvania Railroad.] The Ohio GL continued to increase its route network throughout the Buckeye State, mostly by the acquisition of pre-existing carriers.  Great Lakes GL of Indiana  In 1941, shortly after the creation of the Great Lakes GL, The Greyhound Corporation renamed the Ohio GL as the Great Lakes Greyhound Lines (GLGL) of Indiana, based still in Indiana but as a subsidiary of the main undenominated Great Lakes GL (based in Detroit). In 1947 the GLGL of Indiana closed the gap between its two detached routes (the one between Detroit and Louisville and the one between Evansville and Indianapolis) by obtaining authority from the State of Indiana to run between Madison and Paoli (both in the Hoosier State), thereby also providing a new direct (shortcut) through-route between Evansville and Cincinnati.  Cincinnati and Lake Erie (C&LE;) Transportation Company  In 1945 The Greyhound Corporation bought a controlling (majority) interest in the Cincinnati and Lake Erie (C&LE;) Transportation Company, which had begun in 1923 as the highway-coach subsidiary of the Cincinnati and Lake Erie (C&LE;) Railroad, an electric interurban railway in western Ohio, which had ended its rail operations in 1939. The C&LE; bus firm ran on a main line between Toledo and Hamilton (a suburb of Cincinnati), including several alternate loops, plus along branch lines between Dayton and Columbus, Dayton and Delaware, Xenia and Columbus, and Lima and Springfield (all in the Buckeye State); it also ran extensive suburban operations based in Dayton. That purchase provided Greyhound with the valuable intrastate rights along many route segments on which it had previously held only the interstate rights. Greyhound in 1946 got approval from the ICC and in 1947 merged its new property into the Great Lakes GL of Indiana.  Safety Motor Coach Lines  Edwin (Ed) Ekstrom, an accountant by education and by profession, born in Ludington, Michigan, and raised in Hibbing, Minnesota, in 1917 became an investor and participant in the Mesaba Transportation Company, based in Hibbing, the first incorporated firm (replacing the Hibbing Transportation Company, a partnership consisting of Eric Wickman, Ralph Bogan, and others) leading to the founding of the Greyhound empire. In 1923 Ekstrom acquired (from Wickman's corporation) a controlling interest in the Eastern Wisconsin Transportation Company (running between Madison and Fond du Lac, both in the Beaver State), which (in -21) Wickman had financed during its founding by E.J. Stone; Ekstrom then went to Wisconsin and took charge of his new property. In 1924 Stone resigned from the firm which he had founded, then he went to work as a bus salesman for the Mack Truck Company. Shortly afterward the Eastern Wisconsin concern became sold again - to an electric interurban railway and later (the last time) to the Northland GL. Later that same year, 1924, Ekstrom, with the backing of Wickman, founded the Safety Motor Coach Lines, starting with two Fageol Safety Coaches (hence the name of the firm, with the pleased approval of the Fageol brothers), running between Muskegon and Grand Rapids (both in Michigan). Within months Ekstrom extended his route network northward to Fremont and to Ludington (both in Michigan) and to the southwest to Chicago (in Illinois) via Holland, South Haven, and Benton Harbor (all three in Michigan) and Michigan City (in Indiana). Ekstrom also started a detached route, farther north in Michigan, between Petoskey and Traverse City, which he sold later (about 1926), which (in 1948) the Great Lakes GL reacquired (from the North Star Lines), thereby completing a direct through- route between Chicago and Sault Sainte Marie (in the eastern part of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan) via Benton Harbor, Muskegon, Ludington, and Saint Ignace (all in Michigan). Ekstrom used the name Greyhound by which to refer to his coaches, and he caused that name to be painted onto them. Ekstrom's firm also began using a logo or trademark, consisting of a running greyhound dog superimposed on a ring, which bore (on its lower half) the name ‚ÄúSafety Motor Coach Lines‚Äù and (on its upper half) the words \\"Greyhounds of the Highway\\". That design, with only slight modifications (mostly in the inscription), became the pattern for shoulder patches on the uniforms for drivers throughout the entire Greyhound system, and it continued as such until late in the 1980s. Ekstrom also used and promoted the slogan \\"ride the Greyhounds\\". By the end of 1925 Ekstrom's firm appeared to own and operate as many as 30 coaches, mostly Fageols plus a few Macks. In 1927 the Safety Motor Coach Lines introduced overnight service between Chicago and Muskegon, during an era while nighttime long-distance highway running was still a rarity. All that took place while the Ford Model T was still in production, before Henry Ford (in October 1927) introduced his (second) Model A.  Motor Transit Corporation  In a crucial move on 20 September 1926, Eric Wickman and his collaborators and investors in Duluth, Minnesota, formed the Motor Transit Corporation (MTC), which in 1929 became renamed as The Greyhound Corporation. The MTC, a holding company, promptly began buying controlling interests in operating companies in the motor-coach industry. The MTC on 15 October 1926 first bought the Safety Motor Coach Lines, which in 1924 Ed Ekstrom had founded. On the same day the MTC bought also a controlling interest in the Interstate Stages, using the brand name, trade name, or service name of the Oriole Lines, running in part between Detroit and Chicago via South Bend and Elkhart (both in Indiana). Ed Ekstrom then served as the first president of the MTC. It was agreed that, over time, the acquired lines operating under MTC would adopt the Greyhound name and paint scheme. In July, 1927Muskegon Chronicle, July 6, 1927 Ekstrom, along with brothers, Robert and Alex, sold their interests in Safety Motor Coach and MTC to Wickman then headed to Fort Worth, Texas, where they took over two other firmsSan Antonio Express Pioneer, September 29, 1929 - the Southland Transportation Corporation, which the MTC had started, and the Red Ball Motor Bus Company, which the MTC had bought - which later became major parts of the Southwestern Greyhound Lines. During that era many bus companies used the names of animals, often coupled with the names of colors, by which to refer to the buses, the companies, or both (such as Cardinal, Oriole, Blue Goose, Purple Swan, Blue Bird, Eagle, Jackrabbit, and Thorobred) along with colored objects (such as Red Ball, Green Line, Gold Seal, White Star, Silver Line, and Red Arrow) - and, inevitably perhaps, Greyhound. Several early operators used the word greyhound. For instance, one firm, named as the Greyhound Bus Line, running in eastern Kentucky from Ashland to Paintsville and to Mount Sterling, was one of the carriers bought by and merged into the Consolidated Coach Corporation (in 1928), which began using the brand name of the Southeastern Greyhound Lines (in 1931), and which became renamed as the Southeastern Greyhound Lines (in 1936). According to the best information now available, E.J. Stone of the Eastern Wisconsin Transportation Company made the first such use of the name greyhound directly traceable into the Motor Transit Corporation (which in 1929 became renamed as The Greyhound Corporation), for Stone had informally referred to his coaches as greyhounds, commenting on the resemblance of them to sleek, slender, swift, graceful hounds. Many authors, observers, and bus historians have credited Ed Ekstrom (with his flair for marketing) with the first use of the name Greyhound in a way which became the name of the once-great company. It's true that Ekstrom took the use of the name Greyhound into the MTC when the MTC bought Ekstrom's Safety Motor Coach Lines. However, it appears that Ekstrom had gotten that usage from E.J. Stone when Ekstrom took over the Eastern Wisconsin Transportation Company. When the MTC bought Ekstrom's Safety Motor Coach Lines, Ekstrom and his company contributed to the MTC not only the name Greyhound and the image of a greyhound dog but also the blue-and-white livery used on Ekstrom's coaches. [Ekstrom is said to have proposed the use of the name of the Greyhound Lines even before he left Wisconsin (with the support of his associates in Minnesota) to go eastward.] In 1928 the MTC bought the Southwestern Michigan Motor Coach Company, which had recently become formed, to acquire most of the routes of the Shore Line Motor Coach Company (a subsidiary of an Insull railway property) to the east of Gary, a suburb of Chicago in the northwest corner of Indiana, consisting of the route between Chicago and Detroit via Kalamazoo (in Michigan), an alternate one between Chicago and Grand Rapids via Benton Harbor, and one between South Bend (in Indiana) and Detroit (which extended and made connections with a railway route, which still operates, now under the name of the South Shore Line, between Chicago and South Bend). [The last bus route, between South Bend and Detroit, no longer operates.] In 1929 the Safety Motor Coach Lines took over both the Interstate Stages and the Southwestern Michigan Motor Coach Company. During the same year, 1929, the Safety Motor Coach Lines acquired another route between Chicago and Detroit, from the YellowaY of Michigan, a part of the Pioneer-YellowaY System, which Greyhound had bought (earlier in 1929) from the American Motor Transportation Company. The Safety Motor Coach Lines continued (as a subsidiary of the MTC) until 1930, when it became renamed as the Eastern Greyhound Lines (EGL) of Michigan, which in 1935 became renamed as the Central Greyhound Lines (CGL) of Michigan (making the third use of the name of the Central GL), which in 1936 became a part of the undenominated main (second) Central GL, a part of which in -48 became merged into the Great Lakes GL. In 1930, when the name of the EGL of Michigan came into use, the firm owned and operated a combined fleet of about 135 coaches.  Michigan routes of Central GL  Starting in 1935, the (third) Central GL (the CGL of Michigan) and then soon (in 1936) the undenominated main (second) Central GL operated all the Greyhound routes in Michigan, including the heavy traffic between Chicago and Detroit, as well as the likewise heavy mainline traffic between Chicago and New York City via Cleveland (in Ohio), including the route via Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse, and Albany (all four in the Empire State), paralleling the touted \\"water-level route\\" of the New York Central (railway) System. [The (second) Central GL (and, later, the fourth Central GL, the CGL of New York, also ran a large route network throughout upstate New York, with one extension to Montr√©al, Qu√©bec, Canada, and another extension from Albany to Boston via Pittsfield, Springfield, and Worcester (all the last four in Massachusetts.] In 1947 The Greyhound Corporation finished reacquiring the remaining shares of the non- voting stock in the Central GL which (in 1935) it had transferred to the NYC System. No longer having a need to maintain a subsidiary coinciding with the territory of that railway firm, Greyhound next reorganized some of its routes in the Midwest and the Northeast, seeking a more efficient operation.  Great Lakes GL as a division  On 31 December 1948 the Great Lakes GL became a division of The Greyhound Corporation (rather than a subsidiary), thus losing its separate corporate existence, then Greyhound merged the GLGL of Indiana (the smaller Indiana corporation) into the main Great Lakes GL (as a division of the parent firm) and transferred into the Great Lakes GL all the Michigan routes (including the ones reaching to Chicago) of the (second) Central GL. [By that time the State of Indiana had ended its requirement for domestic corporations there.] The new division, the Great Lakes GL, took over all the coaches of both previous Great Lakes firms (that is, both the GLGL and the GLGL of Indiana, both the main firm and the Indiana subsidiary) plus all the coaches previously assigned to the Michigan routes of the (second) Central GL.  New routes for Great Lakes GL  In 1955, in connection with the merger of the (second) Central GL and the Pennsylvania GL into the new (second) Eastern GL, The Greyhound Corporation transferred three sets of routes in Illinois and Indiana to the Great Lakes GL: :first, all the Illinois routes of the (second) Central GL (formerly the routes of the Illinois GL) ‚Äì that is, mostly, between Chicago and Effingham (on the way to Memphis in Tennessee and New Orleans in Louisiana), between Chicago and Saint Louis, between Chicago and Louisiana (not the state of Louisiana but rather the city of Louisiana in the state of Missouri and on a shortcut, bypassing Saint Louis, to Kansas City in Kansas and Missouri), between Springfield and Champaign (both in Illinois), and between Springfield and Davenport (in Iowa); :second, the route between Detroit and Indianapolis, from the Pennsylvania GL; :third, the route between Chicago and Evansville via Danville (in Illinois) and Terre Haute and Vincennes (both in Indiana), plus a branch line from Paris (in Illinois) to Paducah (in Kentucky), from the Pennsylvania GL (acquired in 1954 with the purchase of the Southern Limited from the Fitzgerald brothers).  Great Lakes GL in 1957  By 1957 the Great Lakes GL reached as far to the north as Sault Sainte Marie (on the Upper Peninsula of Michigan), as far to the east as Port Huron and Detroit (both in Michigan) and Columbus (in Ohio), as far to the south as Louisville (in Kentucky) and Evansville (in Indiana), and as far to the west as Davenport (in Iowa) and Saint Louis and Louisiana (both in Missouri); it met the Eastern Canadian GL (in Saint Ignace, Port Huron, and Detroit), the Northland GL (in Saint Ignace and Chicago), the new (second) Eastern GL (in Toledo and Columbus), the Atlantic GL (in Columbus and Cincinnati), the Southeastern GL (in Cincinnati, Louisville, Evansville, Effingham, and Saint Louis), the Southwestern GL (in Saint Louis and Louisiana), and the Overland GL (in Chicago and Davenport). The Great Lakes GL took part in many major interlined through-routes (using pooled equipment in cooperation with other Greyhound companies) ‚Äì that is, the use of through- coaches on through-routes running through the territories of two or more Greyhound regional operating companies - including these: :connecting Detroit with Sudbury (in Ontario in Canada, via Sault Sainte Marie), Duluth (in Minnesota, via Saint Ignace in Michigan), Charleston (in West Virginia), Memphis and Nashville (both in Tennessee), Mobile and Birmingham, Alabama, New Orleans (in Louisiana), and Jacksonville, Miami, and Saint Petersburg, Florida; :connecting Toronto (in Ontario in Canada) with Minneapolis (in Minnesota) via Chicago, with Winnipeg (in Manitoba in Canada) via Detroit, Chicago, and Minneapolis, and with both Miami and Saint Petersburg (both in Florida); :connecting Chicago with Memphis (in Tennessee), New Orleans (in Louisiana), Laredo (in Texas) via Dallas and San Antonio (both in Texas), and Los Angeles (in California) via Louisiana and Kansas City (both in Missouri); :connecting Buffalo (in New York) with both Chicago and Saint Louis (in Missouri), both via Detroit and St Thomas, Ontario.  Merger with Northland GL  In September 1957, in another round of consolidation, The Greyhound Corporation further merged the Great Lakes GL with - not into but rather with - the Northland GL (called also Northland or NGL), a neighboring regional operating company - thereby forming the Central Division of The Greyhound Corporation (called also the Central GL, making the fifth of six uses of that name), the second of four huge new divisions (along with Eastern, Southern, and Western). The administrative headquarters functions of the Great Lakes GL moved from Detroit to Minneapolis, Minnesota, the home of the Northland GL. The Northland GL had reached as far north as Sweetgrass, Montana (in Montana) and Winnipeg, Manitoba, as far east as Saint Ignace, Michigan, Milwaukee (in Wisconsin), and Chicago (in Illinois), as far to the south as Chicago (in Illinois), Dubuque (in Iowa), and Omaha (in Nebraska), and as far to the west as Sweetgrass, Great Falls, Helena, and Butte, Montana; it had met (to the west) the Northwestern GL, (to the north) the Western Canadian GL and the Eastern Canadian GL, (to the east and south) the Great Lakes GL and the (second) Eastern GL (formerly the second Central GL and the Pennsylvania GL), and (to the south) the Overland GL. Thus ended the Great Lakes GL and the Northland GL, and thus began the (fifth) Central GL.  Beyond Great Lakes GL  Later (about 1966) The Greyhound Corporation reorganized again, into just two humongous divisions, named as the Greyhound Lines East (GLE) and the Greyhound Lines West (GLW); even later (about 1970) it eliminated those two divisions, thereby leaving a single gargantuan undivided nationwide fleet. In 1987 The Greyhound Corporation (the original parent Greyhound firm), which had become widely diversified far beyond transportation, sold its entire highway- coach operating business (its core bus business) to a new company, named as the Greyhound Lines, Inc., called also GLI, based in Dallas, Texas - a separate, independent, unrelated firm, which was the property of a group of private investors under the promotion of Fred Currey, a former executive of the Continental Trailways (later renamed as the Trailways, Inc., called also TWI, also based in Dallas), which was by far the largest member company in the Trailways association. Later in 1987 the Greyhound Lines, Inc., the GLI, the new firm based in Dallas, further bought the Trailways, Inc., the TWI, its largest competitor, and merged it into the GLI. The lenders and the other investors of the GLI ousted Fred Currey as the chief executive officer (CEO) after the firm went into bankruptcy in 1990. The GLI has since continued to experience difficulties and lackluster performance under a succession of new owners and new executives while continuing to reduce its level of service - by hauling fewer passengers aboard fewer coaches on fewer trips along fewer routes with fewer stops in fewer communities in fewer states - and by doing so on fewer days - that is, increasingly operating some trips less often than every day (fewer than seven days per week) - and by using fewer through- coaches, thus requiring passengers to make more transfers (from one coach to another). After the sale to the GLI, The Greyhound Corporation (the original parent Greyhound firm) changed its name to the Greyhound-Dial Corporation, then the Dial Corporation, then the Viad Corporation. [The contrived name Viad appears to be a curious respelling of the former name Dial - if one scrambles the letters D, I, and A, then turns the V upside down and regards it as the Greek letter lambda - Œõ - that is, the Greek equivalent of the Roman or Latin letter L.] The website of the Viad Corporation (http://www.viad.com) in September 2008 makes no mention of its corporate history or its past relationship to Greyhound - that is, its origin as The Greyhound Corporation.

The series stars Philip Madoc as protagonist DCI Noel Bain. Four series were broadcast between 1994 and 2002; and first aired as Yr Heliwr on S4C, before being broadcast on Channel 5 in the UK. The series was filmed in both English and in Welsh, with each scene being shot first in one language and then in the other.Eclipse Magazine - http://eclipsemagazine.com/dvd/15098/ The series has since been dubbed into more than a dozen languages and shown all over the world. The series is set in South Wales, and features a variety of post-industrial, rural, urban and seaside landscapes. The pilot episode was filmed in the Aberystwyth area. All twenty-two episodes are available on DVD. Synopsis Philip Madoc plays Detective Chief Inspector Noel Bain, a man who looks back fondly to the days when policing involved chasing villains, playing rugby and drinking beer. However, he has come to realise that contemporary policing imposes dilemmas that no training manual could ever anticipate. He is a man out of time and seeks to protect the old way of life, and what he believes are important traditional values. Bain is a widower who has a tempestuous relationship with his daughter, Hannah. Despite resenting the lack of time her father spent with the family because of police work, Hannah becomes a WPC on the same police force. Bain often sees his position as not just a job; but his raison d'√™tre; meaning that his journey is often an emotional and painful one as the personal and professional universes collide. Bain has a close friendship with police pathologist Professor Margaret Edwards (Sharon Morgan), but his true feelings for her remain ambiguous. Other regular characters include Gillian Elisa Thomas and Geraint Lewis. Joining the regulars in the last series were Bryn F√¥n, Ieuan Rhys, Huw Llyr and Elen Bowman. The series also featured guest characters who were played by, among others, Margaret John, Ioan Gruffudd, Sue Jones-Davies, David Warner, John Rhys-Davies, David Lyn, Archie Panjabi and Si√¢n Phillips. Reception The Windsor Public Library stated that the series drew upon \\"Intricate plots, strongly drawn characters, and gritty authenticity\\", making it a \\"riveting Welsh drama series\\".Windsor Public Library - http://windsor.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1396189016_a_mind_to_kill Eclipse Magazine said of the series; \\"A Mind To Kill is a dark and twisty show... CSI's ancestor. Murder is the most extreme human action and stories sometimes play out against the most extraordinary of circumstances, e.g. a Miners' Strike, when the traditional way of life of the community is already under threat.\\" They continued by stating that; \\"There is a strong psychological element, and as the series proceeds, the stories begin to dig deeper into Bain‚Äôs subconscious. The unresolved death of his wife causes great mental anguish and torment, and his dealings with the people he meets and the crimes he investigates are not always as straightforward as they should be.\\"Eclipse Magazine - http://eclipsemagazine.com/dvd/15098/ Episodes Pilot (1991) Series 1 (1994‚Äî1995) Series 2 (1997) Christmas Special (1998) Series 3 (2001) Series 4 (2002)  References  External links * British crime television series S4C original programming British drama television series 1990s British drama television series 2000s British drama television series Channel 5 (British TV channel) original programming 1994 British television series debuts 2002 British television series endings Television shows set in Wales English-language television shows Detective television series ","title":"A Mind to Kill"},{"id":"19167745","text":"G√©rard Ouellet (17 February 1913 - 3 April 1975) was a member of the House of Commons of Canada.

Hauling-out typically occurs between periods of foraging activity. Rather than remain in the water, pinnipeds haul-out onto land or sea-ice for reasons such as reproduction and rest. Hauling-out is necessary in seals for mating (with the exception of the Baikal seal) and giving birth (although a distinction is generally made between reproductive aggregations, termed \\"rookeries\\", and non-reproductive aggregations, termed \\"haul-outs\\"). Other benefits of hauling-out may include predator avoidance, thermoregulation, social activity, parasite reduction and rest. There is much variation in haul-out patterns among different seal species.Hoelzel, A. Rus. (2002). Marine Mammal Biology: An Evolutionary Approach. Blackwell Publishing. . p. 197. Haul-out sites may be segregated by age and sex within the same species. Many species of pinniped have only a few localized rookeries where they breed, but periodically occupy hundreds of haul-out sites throughout the range. For example, the Australian fur seals breed on only nine islands in Bass Strait but also occupy up to 50 haul-out sites in south-east Australian waters,Gales, Nick; Gales, Nicholas; Hindell, Mark; & Kirkwood, Roger. (2003). Marine Mammals: Fisheries, Tourism and Management Issues. CSIRO Publishing. . p. 259. and Steller sea lions have around 50 rookeries throughout their range, but several hundred haul-out sites. Hauling-out behaviour provides numerous benefits to pinnipeds besides reproduction. This behaviour has been shown to be used for activities such as thermoregulation, predator avoidance, moulting, nursing, and resting. Haul-out frequency, duration, and site location (i.e. sea-ice, floating-ice, and terrestrial) are all influenced by physical constraints (i.e. air temperature, wind speed, and time of day) and biological constraints (i.e. moulting, age, and sex). Variations in hauling-out behaviour exist among pinnipeds for reasons such as geographical location. Examples  Weddell seals  Weddell seal on terrestrial haul-out site. Haul-out sites of Weddell seals are not necessarily geographically distinct from one another and vary due to physical factors (i.e. food availability) and biological factors (i.e. age). Weddell seals are high latitude Antarctic inhabitants, allowing them to haul-out onto ice as adults year round for foraging. Similar to other pinnipeds, Weddell seals haul-out for reasons such as feeding, rest, avoidance of predators, and thermoregulation. Seasonal variation has been indicated to influence the haul-out patterns of this species, environmental factors such as air temperature and wind speed trigger a shift from long-duration diurnal haul-outs to short-duration nocturnal patterns. Following moulting season the number of haul-outs performed increases allowing the seals to benefit from the increased air temperature and thus decreasing the energetic cost of growing new hair. The haul-out patterns of female Weddell seal are heavily influenced by the age of their pups. In the first week post parturition, haul-out frequency is high and females remain hauled-out for longer periods prior to the pups starting to swim. Haul-out frequency decreases as the pups are weaned and mating begins. Walruses Group of walruses on sea-ice haul-out. Walruses tend to occupy both terrestrial and sea ice haul-out sites, alternating between the two depending on resource availability. Walruses haul-out onto land primarily for birthing, moulting, nursing, and resting, meanwhile using sea-ice haul-out sites for foraging and predator avoidance. These physiological factors are correlated with both the duration and frequency of haul-outs among walruses. Sea ice sites are more commonly used for shorter and more frequent haul-outs compared to terrestrial sites, which are commonly used to fulfill more time-consuming requirements (i.e. breeding and birthing). Hauling-out is also used as a method of thermoregulation, therefore it is influenced by various environmental factors such as wind speed, temperature, and even time of day. Accounting for these environmental factors, walruses more frequently haul-out from late morning to early evening and avoid hauling-out during weather periods of intense cold or high winds. Haul-out frequency is at a maximum for walruses during the summer using terrestrial haul-out sites as sea ice sites are then further from foraging grounds. As female walruses haul-out for parturition, the males are territorial of the haul-out site surrounding the female herd. In these instances, hauling-out provides an opportunity for more aggressive and territorial males to mate. Ringed seal Ringed seal on sea-ice haul-out. Ringed seal hauling-out occurs throughout any point in the year, however it reaches a maximum during the spring. In comparison to other pinniped species, ringed seals haul-out with a shorter duration year round. Ringed seals have a diel haul-out pattern in which they spend more time hauled-out out during the night, an uncommon feature among pinnipeds. Hauling- out spikes an increase in the herding behaviour of ringed seals, particularly in the Ladoga subspecies. Subspecies of the ringed seal prefer different haul- out sites depending on their geographical location and environmental constraints. For example, 5 subspecies of ringed seals prefer hauling-out onto land-fast ice, however Phoca hispida ochotensis prefers drifting pack ice, meanwhile Phoca hispida hispida occupies both land-fast ice and far offshore areas of relatively stable ice. The majority of ringed seals however use terrestrial haul-out sites to create birth layers in the snow for newborn seal pups. Harbour seal Harbour seals on intertidal site Harbour seals are the most abundant pinniped in the eastern North Pacific Ocean. Much like other pinnipeds, harbour seals haul-out for reasons such as thermoregulation, breeding, mating, moulting, resting, and foraging. They commonly haul-out onto intertidal ledges, mudflats, beaches, and ice floes year round. Haul-out sites are often revisited on a regular basis by the same herd and are heavily affected by tide height. Harbour seals are likely to move haul-out sites in response to inclement weather conditions (i.e. wind chill and wave size) to more favourable sites in rocky reefs, mudflats, and beaches that are exposed during lower tides. Frequency and duration of the behaviour is at a maxima during early afternoon when lower tides and higher air temperatures are prevalent. During parturition and weaning, females spend more time hauled-out ashore until their pups begin to swim, meanwhile males spend less time hauled- out and maintain aquatic territories instead. Moulting and predation risk also increase the time spent hauled-out. Despite the increased time ashore for females and decreased time ashore or males during birthing and weaning, biological constraints such as age and sex have not been shown to effect harbour seal haul-outs. Both male and female harbour seals of all ages are consistent with time spent hauled-out. Harbour seals commonly inhabit regions susceptible to human disturbances (i.e. industries such as the fishery), a factor that has been studied and shown to alter haul-out patterns. Human disturbances negatively influence the duration and frequency of harbour seal haul-outs, decreasing the occurrence of this behaviour as human interference increases.

It loosely depicts the life of Eug√®ne Fran√ßois Vidocq, a French criminal who reformed and became a famous French Prefect of Police during the Napoleonic era. Plot The rogue (George Sanders) who would later call himself Eug√®ne Fran√ßois Vidocq is born in a prison cell, the twelfth child of a woman who steals a loaf of bread each time she needs shelter to give birth. As the boy grows into a man, he is constantly in and out of jail. As the story begins, he and his cutpurse cellmate and associate, Emile Vernet (Akim Tamiroff), escape using a file hidden in a birthday cake provided by Vernet's aunt Ernestine (Gisela Werbisek). While making their way to Paris, they are hired to pose for a painter (Fritz Leiber), Vidocq as Saint George and Vernet as the dragon. As the church painting nears completion, the pair steal the horse on which Vidocq is posing. In Paris, Uncle Hugo (Vladimir Sokoloff), the head of Vernet's criminal family, decides the safest place for the fugitives is in the army. He has a forger relative provide Vidocq with a fake commission as Lieutenant \\"Rousseau.\\" While in Marseille, waiting to ship out to serve with Napoleon in Egypt, Vidocq encounters a singer named Loretta (Carole Landis). She is intrigued with him, while he is more attracted to her ruby garter. Accompanying her when she goes to meet her boring admirer Richet (Gene Lockhart), Vidocq manages to steal the garter. After two years, Vidocq and Vernet leave the army. Returning to Paris, they make a detour around the church adorned by their likenesses. They come across the jewel-laden Marquise De Pierremont (Alma Kruger). Vidocq wrangles an invitation to her chateau after retrieving her pet monkey from a cemetery (where he also claims to be a relation of a Vidocq buried there). He is a bit alarmed when he discovers that his intended victim's son-in-law is the Minister of Police (Alan Napier), but also enchanted by the official's daughter Therese (Signe Hasso). Unbeknownst to him, she has fallen in love with the image of Saint George, and is greatly disturbed by the painting's uncanny resemblance to their guest. Vidocq and Vernet steal and hide the Marquise's jewels, intending to return for them later. However, when the minister fires Richet, who is now his chief of police, for not recovering the jewels, Vidocq devises a much grander scheme. Through \\"deduction\\", he leads the minister to the hiding place of the jewels, and wins for himself Richet's old job. In that capacity, he gets Vernet's entire band of criminal relatives hired at the Bank of Paris, which he intends to rob. A complication arises when he bumps into Loretta, who turns out to have married Richet. After learning his new identity, Loretta blackmails Vidocq into resuming their relationship. Vidocq tells Vernet to go ahead with the robbery that night. That day, he goes out walking with Therese and her younger sister Mimi. When they are alone, Therese informs him that she has figured out that he stole the jewels. However, she does not care. She is quite willing to follow him, even if it means embarking on a life of crime. Meanwhile, a jealous Richet bursts in on Loretta as his wife waits for Vidocq at a hat store. Richet threatens to kill himself. Instead, in a fit of anger brought on by Loretta's cold response, he shoots and kills her. With that impediment out of the way, Vidocq informs Vernet's family that he has changed his mind; he will hunt them down if they go through with the robbery. Nearly everyone is content with their new jobs at the bank - except Vernet, who ambushes his former friend, forcing Vidocq to kill him. Vidocq confesses his past crimes to the minister and the Marquise. Because he has truly repented and changed, he is forgiven by all of the De Pierremonts and welcomed into the family as he marries Therese.

Early life and education Olowofoyeku was born in May 1917, and he grew up as the last born of a traditional extended family in Ilesha, a town in the west-south-west of what had previously been Northern Nigeria, a protectorate within the British Empire. Ilesha had previously been right on the border with Southern Nigeria, and was near the border with French-ruled Dahomey. In 1914, both British protectorates, together with the Colony of Lagos, were amalgamated as the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria. Olowofoyeku was born about three years after this new colonial entity had been created by the British. His father died a few months before he was born. His mother enrolled him at the age of 5 at Otapete Methodist School and he was baptised there in the Methodist Church in 1924 and assumed the Christian name \\"Daniel\\". In school at Otapete Methodist, Olowofoyeku met classmate, Tai Solarin, then known as Augustus Solarin who became a lifelong friend. They both attended St. Andrew's College, Oyo, from 1936 until 1942. Solarin later said that he was radically changed by Olowofoyeku's final essay in which he made the observation that some of the colonialists were ignorant, and not well-prepared for the duties they were assigned, and therefore had no business running the lives of Nigerians. For this essay, he was punished for challenging the status quo, and suspended from college in his final academic year. However, he sat for and passed the final teacher's examination as an external student a year later. He later dropped the middle name \\"Daniel\\" as protest against his perceived oppression by the colonial authorities. In 1932, Olowofoyeku accepted a starting position as a pupil teacher at Otapete Methodist School, before beginning his teacher training at St. Andrew's College. Teaching career Olowofoyeku taught at Oduduwa College from October 1942 until 1943. His students included Richard Akinjide, later Attorney General of Nigeria. From 1943 until January 1947, he was the Latin teacher at Methodist Boys High School, Lagos. His first appointment as Principal was at Western Boys High School, Benin, from January 1947 until December 1948. During this tenure in 1948, he took and passed the External Intermediate BA degree of the University of London by studying through a correspondence course. Olowofoyeku moved to Ijebu-Ode to take up an appointment as the 3rd Principal of Olu-Iwa College (which changed its name to Adeola Odutola College in 1964), serving from January 1949 until December 1949. Legal career In defence of a lawsuit initiated against him in 1948, Olowofoyeku researched and provided instructions to his defence attorney in court. When the case was decided in his favour, he decided to change career and enter the legal profession, and gained admission into the London School of Economics (LSE) to study law. He left Nigeria in December 1949 and passed the LLB (Bachelor of Laws) in June 1952. He passed the English Bar exams, and was invited to the Bar association (Inner Temple) as a barrister-at-law. He was the first Ijesha man called to the English Bar. He returned to Nigeria just before Christmas in 1952. Political career Olowofoyeku had experienced the social injustices and powerlessness associated with his prejudicial treatment as a student at St. Andrew's College, and was determined to find a political platform to fight against the system that created it. Urged by the nationalistic teachings of Herbert Macaulay, he became acquainted with Nnamdi Azikiwe, leader of the NCNC, through Chief Odeleye Fadahunsi, another Ijesha elder visiting London. Olowofoyeku joined the NCNC in 1952, and became an executive member of the NCNC under Azikiwe in 1954. The Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria was superseded in October 1954 by the Federation of Nigeria, a federal colony which eventually gained extensive self-government within the British Empire. The United Kingdom finally granted the Federation independence as a dominion within the Commonwealth of Nations on 1 October 1960. Olowofoyeku was elected as chairman of Ilesha Urban District Council (IUDC) in 1956, and in the same year won his election to the Western Region's House of Assembly. During this tenure, he sought to modernise Ilesha to the standards he had witnessed being achieved by London County Council during his studies in London. His accomplishments in Ilesha included installation of pipe-borne water, electricity, market development, town planning, road constructions, sanitation and council staff welfare. Olowofoyeku was a member of the NCNC delegates' team to the Nigerian Constitutional Conferences in London of 1957 and 1958, the objectives of which were to seek Nigerian Independence from Britain. He was also elected into the Western House of Assembly in 1956 on the platform of the NCNC representing Ilesha Central Constituency. Olowofoyeku was a member of the NCNC Committee on Africa and Foreign Affairs. He also headed the NCNC Legal Defence Committee, which also included Richard Akinjide, Chief Adeniran Ogunsanya, Kehinde Sofola, and Tunji Ogunbiyi. Olowofoyeku was a distinguished opposition House member even though not a member of Action Group (Nigeria) (AG), the ruling party of Obafemi Awolowo. Awolowo's assessment of the political abilities of Olowofoyeku was that: \\"He [Olowofoyeku] had a good sense of justice and belief in democracy\\". Having gained independence from the British as a dominion on 1 October 1960, the Federation of Nigeria lasted until 1 October 1963, when it became a republic within the Commonwealth called the Federal Republic of Nigeria. In 1963, Olowofoyeku was appointed Minister of Education, replacing Sanya Onabamiro. However, after the creation of the Mid-Western State in July 1963, Olowofoyeku was installed as Attorney General and Minister of Justice of the Western Region from 26 September 1963. He was also at the same time appointed a Queen's Counsel (QC) by the British Government, as recognition of his official legal duties to the Commonwealth. Due to internal political strife within the NCNC and under-representation of the West in the federal cabinet, Olowofoyeku and other Western Nigeria NCNC members in the legislature decided to align themselves with Akintola into the newly formed Nigerian National Democratic Party (NNDP) in 1964. Olowofoyeku's constituents in Ilesha were angry and viewed this move suspiciously and unfavorably. Consequently, his previously staunch support among them quickly vanished. The NCNC and AG now formed a new national alliance, UPGA (United Progressive Grand Alliance) against the ruling NPC/NNDP alliance. When election time came in December 1965, it was payback time. There was chaos throughout the country, particularly in the West and especially in Ilesha. Olowofoyeku escaped an assassin's bullet by a few inches during a campaign rally near Ilesha. In the aftermath of the December 1965 elections, there was a bloody military coup on 15 January 1966, establishing a National Military Government. Olowofoyeku was arrested and taken into custody by the Military Government on 30 January 1966 and detained for six months. He was first detained at Agodi in Ibadan and later transferred to KiriKiri in Lagos. He was allowed very limited family visitation rights throughout his political incarceration at KiriKiri. Olowofoyeku was released after the second counter coup on 29 July 1966 that was carried out by soldiers of Northern Nigerian extraction who replaced the old military regime of Major-General Aguiyi- Ironsi. After being set free, Olowofoyeku vowed never to get involved in partisan politics again. Within weeks of his release in July 1966, he had left Nigeria and departed for Paris, France, to seek rest and refuge. Later legal career On his return to Nigeria late in 1967, Olowofoyeku moved to Lagos and re-opened his law practice in Western House on Broad Street near the Lagos High Court. He continued to practice law for many years, during which time he was one of the first 20 to be appointed as a Senior Advocate of Nigeria (the equivalent of the Queen's Counsel in the UK). Despite being approached by Obafemi Awolowo in 1979 to come and join his new Unity Party of Nigeria (UPN), Olowofoyeku declined. He later relocated his legal practice to his home in Victoria Island, Lagos. Death On 26 March 2003, at the age of 85, Olowofoyeku died. His funeral, which lasted several days, was held partly in the High Court in Lagos, at his main residence in Victoria Island, and at his two homes in Ilesha.A celebration of life.

Biography Timoshenko Aslanides was born on Christmas Eve, 1943, in the Crown Street Women's Hospital, in Sydney, to John Paul Aslanides (1901-1962), a 1925 immigrant to Australia from the Greek community in Kerasus (on the Black Sea coast) and Olive Emma Browne (1910-1993), daughter of a pastoralist family from Lockhart, New South Wales. Aslanides graduated BA (Music) from the University of Sydney in 1967 and B.Ec from the Australian National University in 1976. He began writing poetry after he moved to Canberra in 1972, where he joined the Australian Public Service. His first book of poems, The Greek Connection, won him the British Commonwealth Poetry Prize for 1978 for the best first book of poetry in English published the previous year in the British Commonwealth excluding England; he was the first Australian to win this prize. He has since produced 16 books of poetry. His fourth book of poetry, Australian Things, was awarded joint second prize in the 1988 bicentennial poetry awards for book-length collections. This book was inspired by a remark, in a conversation with his mentor, by Judith Wright, who had written to him in November 1979, inviting him to lunch at her bush-cottage retreat near Braidwood, in southern New South Wales. Aslanides regards the subsequent and enduring friendship with Judith Wright as both an apprenticeship as well as a rewarding artistic relationship for both poets. Because he is Australian-born and Australian-focussed and, since July 1985, a full-time professional Australian poet, he does not (and never has) identified as an \\"ethnic\\" poet; nor does he write \\"multicultural\\" poetry.Timoshenko Aslanides, \\"On My Australian Poetry\\", Quadrant, May 2018, pp. 103‚Äì8. Though he feels that most, if not all of his poetry has its origin in love, the context of this affection is the celebration of the natural and built environments of Australia, and the history and imaginative genius of the people. Timoshenko Aslanides has worked as a full-time, professional poet since July 1985, when he resigned from the Public Service.

Byron is a self-described lazy bastard, who came to London from Belfast in search of gainful employment, which he has found in the form of performing sexual favours on older gay men to supplement his giro. On this occasion, he is joined by his hometown friend Kenny (Mulhern), newly arrived to the Big Smoke after receiving a letter from Byron that doesn't tell the whole story of what he does for a living. This is Kenny's first visit to a gay pub but it's not his last. In fact, Kenny turns out to be better at this gainful employment lark than Byron; except that Kenny is so talented, he accidentally shags men to death. Meanwhile, Byron's work leads him to an encounter with The Desperate Dwarf (Griffiths) with a three- and-a-half inch willie, from whom he liberates the very cattle prod used to kill The Queen (Praed), who, it transpires, became the lover of Golders Green (Godley) because he passed Golders Green's really hard, really long Red Bull test. The Queen was killed on a Friday evening while Golders Green, an otherwise Orthodox Jew, was at Sabbath Services. The plot thickens and the dead gay guy count rises, as more people begin to look for the bread in the bed, not least including The Iron Lady (Sharman) and several accomplices, who manage to find the bed but there is no money in it.

It created such a storm that the film quickly sold out and people had to be turned away at the box office, so the film was given extra viewings to accommodate the demand. During screenings people's reaction to the film was extreme: either they loved it or walked out in disgust. Critical reception of 9 Dead Gay Guys was very negative, earning a Rotten Tomatoes score of 18 out of 100, based upon 22 aggregate reviews. However Dave Kehr wrote for The New York Times that \\"the film strains mightily to be flashy and hip but finishes more in the realm of the merely distasteful,\\" though Andy Klein of Variety stated \\"9 Dead Gay Guys, a dark comedy in the John Waters tradition, takes place in such a cartoonish, good-natured universe it's hard to imagine anyone taking offence.\\" Due to the film's seemingly controversial subject matter the film could only secure a limited release, and subsequently made only $26,377 at the box office. In the film's initial sole theater, the film grossed $3,462 in the opening week. The film won two major awards. The first was the 2002 'Audience Award' for 'Best Feature Film at the Dublin Gay and Lesbian film festival.

Ultimately, Massachusetts voters defeated Question 1 by a wide margin, with approximately 70% opposed versus 30% in favor. Specific provisions This proposed law would have had the following features: * Reduction of the state personal income tax rate to 2.65% for all categories of taxable income for the tax year beginning on or after January 1, 2009. * Elimination of the tax for all tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2010. * The personal income tax to which the initiative would have applied would have been the 'income received or gain realized by individuals and married couples, by estates of deceased persons, by certain trustees and other fiduciaries, by persons who are partners in and receive income from partnerships, by corporate trusts, and by persons who receive income as shareholders of \\"S corporations\\" as defined under federal tax law.' * The proposed law would not have affected the tax due on income or gain realized in a tax year beginning before January 1, 2009. * The proposed law states that if any of its parts were declared invalid, the other parts would stay in effect.

They continue northeasterly through Funk before intersecting and overlapping Nebraska Highway 44 through Axtell. They then continue through Minden, where they intersect Nebraska Highway 10. They continue going northeast through Heartwell, where the road turns due east. At Hastings, U.S. 34 and U.S. 6 intersect U.S. Highway 281, and U.S. 34 then turns north with U.S. 281. U.S. 34 and U.S. 281 then follow a divided highway north to Grand Island, intersecting Interstate 80 south of Grand Island near its crossing of the Platte River. At the southern end of Grand Island, U.S. 34 ends its overlap with U.S. 281 and turns east, overlapping the western segment of Nebraska Highway 2. U.S. 34 and Nebraska Highway 2 continue east through the southern portion of Grand Island, where they briefly enter Merrick County while crossing the Platte River.

It connects the cities of Spring Valley, Stewartville, Rochester, and Lake City. The route in Minnesota is in length. Route description U.S. 63 enters the state in Fillmore County, just north of Chester, Iowa. It travels north to Spring Valley where it becomes concurrent with State Highway 16, following it west for five miles entering Mower County. It continues north through Racine, then into Stewartville, after passing into Olmsted County, where it becomes a divided highway. Immediately after Stewartville, it intersects Interstate 90, near Rochester International Airport. The highway then enters Rochester 1 mile after the I-90 junction, where it is an expressway south of U.S. 52 (slowly becoming a freeway). It then follows U.S. 52 west of downtown Rochester to 75th Street NW, where it departs from U.S. 52. It follows 75th Street eastward to Olmsted County 33, where it continues north from a roundabout. It continues north through Olmsted and Wabasha counties. A short segment of the highway is built to four-lane expressway standards just north of Zumbro Falls. It meets U.S. Highway 61 at Lake City and overlaps it into the city of Red Wing. U.S. 63 turns southeast on State Highway 58 for one block and then turns northeast on 3rd Street. It then curves back northwest to cross over 61, and then reaches the Red Wing Bridge where it crosses the Mississippi River and enters the state of Wisconsin. Nearly all of the route is legally defined as Constitutional Route 59 in the Minnesota Statutes, except for the part between Red Wing and the Mississippi River, which is Legislative Route 161. History U.S. 63 was extended into Minnesota in 1934. The route had previously been marked the year before as U.S. 59, except for the segment running from U.S. 61 to the river crossing, which had been State Highway 58. U.S. 63 was an original 1926 U.S. Route and terminated in Des Moines, Iowa until it was extended north. The U.S. 59 designation was simultaneously reassigned to a new highway running from Laredo, Texas to Pembina, North Dakota. The leg north of Rochester was originally blazed as the Lake City and Rochester Stage Road in 1858. The route was paved when it was marked. In the spring of 2014, it was rerouted to follow U.S. Highway 52 west of downtown Rochester. This makes the route longer, but reduces transit time due to higher speed limits and fewer traffic lights. The segment of the old route 63 between 37th Street NE and 75th Street NE was turned over to Olmsted County, and renamed County route 33. Plans for the change were announced in April, 2012.City to take back Broadway in swap with state - Post-Bulletin http://postbulletin.com/news/stories/display.php?id=1493905 Major intersections Future The Minnesota Department of Transportation also has plans to turn Highway 63 into a controlled-access freeway between U.S. 52 and Interstate 90.

In Missouri, the highway enters the state from Arkansas, just south of Branson. The highway exits the state into Iowa near South Lineville. Route description US 65 enters Missouri between the towns of Omaha, Arkansas and Ridgedale, Missouri. The road is a four-lane expressway, traveling through both Branson and Hollister towards Springfield. Through the Branson area, it is a freeway. North of Branson, the highway intersections with both westbound Route 76 (a freeway spur) and U.S. Route 160. All the way to Highlandville, U.S. 160 is the old alignment of U.S. 65 (until the 1960s). Springfield Just south of Route EE at the Highlandville exit, U.S. 65 returns to freeway status. The freeway is called \\"Schoolcraft Freeway\\" in Springfield, named in honor of Henry Rowe Schoolcraft. Also in Springfield, the highway has junctions with U.S. Route 60 (also known as James River Freeway) and Interstate 44 (I-44). The I-44 interchange includes a flyover ramp connecting northbound U.S. 65 with westbound I-44. Construction is completed that added two at U.S. 60. In September 2011, U.S. 65 became a six-lane divided freeway in Springfield between Interstate 44 and U.S. 60. It was the first six-lane highway in Southwest Missouri. North of Springfield, it returns to a four-lane, non-interstate highway. From Springfield to Buffalo, U.S. 65 has been upgraded as a four-lane non-interstate highway. This project began with the addition of a partial four-lane highway through the Fair Grove area to replace a dangerous traffic light intersection with an overpass. It culminated with the entire length of U.S. 65 becoming a four-lane highway from Springfield to just outside of Buffalo. The project was completed in summer 2010. Through Buffalo, the highway now becomes two lanes with a center left- turn lane. This part of the highway has also seen upgrades in recent years, such as adding rumble strips and extending the middle turn lanes to just outside the city's northern portion. From Buffalo to Preston, entering Hickory County, U.S. 65 remains a two-lane highway and has a four-way intersection with U.S. Route 54. US 65 southbound from US 36 in Chillicothe At Warsaw, the highway crosses over the western end of the Lake of the Ozarks and again becomes a four-lane non-interstate highway at the intersection with Route 7. At Sedalia (where it is called Limit Avenue), it has an intersection with U.S. Route 50 (known locally as Broadway Blvd). At Marshall Junction, north of Sedalia in Saline County, U.S. 65 intersects with both Interstate 70 and U.S. Route 40. In Marshall (where it is called Lexington, Ave), U.S. 65 returns to two-lanes and stays so all the way up to Iowa. At Waverly, the highway becomes concurrent with U.S. Route 24 (which continues to Carrollton). Also in Waverly, U.S. 65 and U.S. 24 both cross the Missouri River on the Waverly Bridge. Further north, the road crosses U.S. Route 36 at Chillicothe and U.S. Route 136 at Princeton. The highway leaves Missouri at South Lineville and enters Iowa. The section of highway from Preston to Marshall Junction has been cited as a good drive for motorcyclists, with its sparsely populated areas and the hilly landscape.

At noon on December 12, 2012, the section of US 71 between Pineville, Missouri and Bannister Road in south Kansas City was also designated as a northern extension of Interstate 49 (I-49). Route description First reassurance marker on US 71 after entering Missouri from Iowa. US 71 enters Missouri in Jane coming from Arkansas. Currently, a new bypass is being built known as the Bella Vista Bypass, to go around Jane and Bella Vista, Arkansas to connect with the freeway section of US 71 near Pineville. At this point, Interstate 49 begins its concurrency with US 71\\\\. I-49 and US 71 pass through many smaller communities before reaching Joplin. In Joplin, I-49 and US 71 interchanges with Interstate 44 and begin a short concurrency from I-44 exits 11 through 18. A few miles east of Joplin, I-49 and US 71 leave I-44 and heads north and enters Carthage. Due to the freeway being built, old sections of the highway have been bypassed and become county roads. I-49 and US 71 pass through Nevada and other communities before reaching the Kansas City area.

History The future of part of the Bella Vista Bypass is on hold. On August 5, 2014, voters in Missouri defeated Amendment 7 at the polls, which would have provided funding various road construction projects in the state. After the measure's defeat, the funding for the connection from the existing southern end of I-49 in Missouri along the Bella Vista Bypass to the state line is in doubt, but Arkansas is moving ahead to construct all but the last connection to the state line. Future In March 2019, the Missouri Highways and Transportation Commission approved the remaining funding needed to complete the Bella Vista Bypass.

Within the State of Nebraska it is a state highway that enters Nebraska on the Kansas state line about south of Dawson and travels north across the extreme eastern portion of the state, to the Nebraska-Iowa border in South Sioux City where it crosses the Missouri River along a concurrency with Interstate 129. The northern of the route generally travels parallel to the Missouri River. The section between the I-680 interchange in Omaha and the Interstate 129 interchange is designated the Lewis & Clark Scenic Byway, one of nine scenic byways in the state. The travel corridor along the Missouri River in Nebraska has always been an important thoroughfare. It was the primary exploration route taken by the Lewis and Clark Expedition as they traveled up the Missouri River in 1804. There are several locations along the US 75 corridor that feature former campsite locations of the expedition. Other cities and towns along the corridor were starting points for travelers and freight headed west on the Oregon Trail. US 75 was one of the original U.S. highways from the initial 1926 plan, however its route has gone through dramatic changes throughout its lifetime. Prior to 1984, the highway left the state in Omaha as it traveled east through the city along the present-day I-480/US 6 corridor across the Missouri River into Iowa. In 1984, with the completion of Interstate 29 in Iowa, a series of transfers between Iowa and Nebraska brought the US 75 designation from the I-29 corridor into Nebraska from Omaha north to replace the routing of US 73 which was truncated back to Dawson at the same time.

The highway travels north through agricultural fields the comes to an intersection with N-8. After crossing the south and north forks of the Big Nemaha River the highway enters Dawson a small village founded as Noraville in 1872 along the Atchison and Nebraska Railroad. The highway continues north out of Dawson and less than later has a junction with the northern terminus of U.S. Route 73. The highway then makes a sweeping turn to jog west before resuming a northerly course as it approaches an intersection with N-4. About later, the highway comes to a junction with N-62. Continuing due north, US 75 travels through the rolling hills of eastern Nebraska before entering the city of Auburn. Here, the highway has an intersection with US 136, the Heritage Scenic Byway. The highway continues north out of Auburn and travels before coming to an intersection with N-67. The two routes run concurrently for before N-67 diverges to the west towards Brock. US 75 maintains its northerly heading for the next before transitioning to a divided highway at an intersection with N-128. The highway then travels past the Nebraska City Municipal Airport as it heads towards a junction with N-2 on the south side of Nebraska City. Here, a business route of US 75 continues north into the city while mainline US 75 turns westerly and runs concurrently with N-2 along the Julius Sterling Morton Beltway as the highway bypasses the city on the southwest side. West of the city, the two highways diverge as N-2 heads west towards Lincoln and US 75 resumes its northerly trek as a standard two- lane highway. Nebraska City to Bellevue Offutt Air Force Base with US 75 along right edge of photo After leaving Nebraska City, the highway has a junction with Business Route US 75 northwest of the city along G Road. From this point, continuing north, US 75 generally runs parallel to, and within of the Missouri River for the duration of length. For the next the highway travels through rural agricultural fields before coming to an intersection with US 34 near Union. Here, US 34 joins up with US 75 and the two highways run concurrently to the north for the next before they come to a junction with N-1 just east of Murray. Continuing north, the concurrent highways travel west of Beaver Lake, then come to a junction with N-66 on the southwest side of Plattsmouth. US 34 formerly turned east into Plattsmouth here to cross the Missouri River into Iowa via a tolled bridge, however a new bridge was opened upstream in October 2014 and US 34 was realigned to utilize the new crossing on the north side of the Platte River near La Platte. As such, US 34 continues concurrent with US 75 along the western side of Plattsmouth, acting as a bypass as the road widens to four lanes. The highway crosses the Platte River then comes to an interchange where US 34 departs to the east along the aforementioned new alignment while US 75 continues north into Bellevue. On the south side of Bellevue, US 75 becomes a limited access freeway known as the Kennedy Freeway. The freeway passes to the west of Offutt Air Force Base just before it comes to an interchange with N-370. Freeway through Omaha Houses of the Minne Lusa Residential Historic District in Omaha West mall of Creighton University with US 75 in the background The freeway continues north through dense residential areas as it enters South Omaha. As the highway passes Chandler Road and bends to the northwest it crosses over the railroad before becoming a depressed freeway just before its interchange with Q Street. Shortly after another interchange, this time with US 275 and N-92. Just later, the highway comes to a complex interchange with I-80 and I-480 near the Hanscom Park area in Midtown Omaha. Here, US 75 joins Interstate 480 where it becomes known as the Gerald Ford Freeway. Together, the two freeways run concurrently past the Gerald R. Ford Birthsite and Gardens, where U.S. President Gerald R. Ford lived for a couple of weeks after his birth in 1913. The freeway continues north towards the newly developed Midtown Crossing at Turner Park. Opened in 2010, it's a seven building, mixed-use development containing luxury condominiums, apartments, and more than of dining, entertainment, and shopping. Here, Interstate 480 departs to the east where it heads into Downtown Omaha before crossing the Missouri River into Council Bluffs. US 75 continues as the North Freeway past Creighton University into North Omaha where it has an incomplete interchange with N-64. The freeway then has an interchange with the Sorensen Parkway and the Storz Expressway which heads east to Eppley Airfield. Shortly after, the freeway becomes a surface four-lane street as it travels through the Miller Park area and the Minne Lusa Residential Historic District, a large single-family residential development that was built by a single firm between 1915 and 1941. The highway then continues north through the Florence neighborhood, one of the oldest cities in Nebraska. Shortly after, the highway turns west just prior to I-680 and runs alongside it for about along McKinley Street before turning north and passing beneath the interstate. Here the highway leaves the city and continues on its path to the north. Lewis and Clark Scenic Byway =Omaha to Sioux City, Iowa= US 75/77 through downtown Winnebago The portion of US 75 north of Omaha to Interstate 129 is designated as the Lewis and Clark Scenic Byway begins. Throughout the remainder of the highway's length parallel to the Missouri River, the highway passes near the locations of former campsites of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. As US 75 continues north beyond the Omaha City Limits, the highway winds its way through rolling hills before entering the Missouri River plain just south of Fort Calhoun. From here, the highway continues its northward travel along the edge of the river plain towards Blair. Here, in Blair, US 75 comes to a junction with US 30, The Lincoln Highway, and together the two routes run concurrently along Washington Street for before coming to an intersection with N-91. Here, US 30 diverges to the southwest towards Fremont while US 75 resumes heading north. About later the highway passes through the small village of Herman and later enters the city of Tekamah where it has an intersection with N-32 just after crossing Tekamah Creek. The highway continues north out of Tekamah, still following the edge of the rolling hills and Missouri River plain passing through rich agricultural fields, for before coming to an intersection with N-51 on the south edge of Decatur just west of the Onawa Materials Yard and Middle Decatur Bend State Wildlife Areas, both enclaves of Nebraska that are situated on the eastern side of the Missouri River and are only accessible via roads in Iowa. US 75 and N-51 run concurrently through Decatur for before N-51 departs to the east to cross the Missouri River into Iowa while US 75 continues north out of town. Heading out of Decatur, the highway climbs back into the rolling hills as it turns northwest into the Omaha Reservation towards the tribal seat of Macy. North of Macy, the highway comes to a junction with N-94 and later intersects US 77 just south of Winnebago. Here the two highways run concurrently to the north as they emerge from the rolling hills back into the Missouri River plain as they pass through the village of Homer. About later, the two-lane highway becomes a four-lane divided highway as it approaches Dakota City. On the west side of Dakota City, the highways intersect N-35 before continuing on to the north. later the highway approaches an interchange with I-129 and US 20 on the southwest side of South Sioux City. Here, US 20 heads west towards O'Neill while US 77 heads north into Sioux City, Iowa. US 75 joins I-129 and US 20 to head east across the southern portion of South Sioux City to the Sergeant Floyd Memorial Bridge which crosses the Missouri River and continues into Iowa. History Lewis and Clark Expedition Prior to the state highway system, travel across Nebraska was accomplished via foot, horseback, and horse-drawn wagons. Many important historical routes passed through or along the present day US 75 corridor. After the acquisition of vast territory in the Louisiana Purchase, President Thomas Jefferson commissioned an expedition to explore and map the newly acquired territory. A select group of U.S. Army volunteers led by Captain Meriweather Lewis and Second Lieutenant William Clark, The Lewis and Clark Expedition, which began on May 14, 1804 near St. Louis, reached southeastern Nebraska in July of that year. As they traveled northwest along the Missouri River the expedition would set up camp at sites on land in present-day Nebraska at several locations. Many of these campsites are recognized by monuments established by the Nebraska Historical Society along the US 75 corridor near the towns of Rulo, Brownville, Plattsmouth, Omaha, Fort Calhoun, Blair, and Jackson. US 75 parallels the Missouri River for the majority of its length in Nebraska and provides access to many historical sites related to the expedition, as such the highway from Omaha north to Interstate 129 is designated the Lewis and Clark Scenic Byway, one of nine scenic byways in the state of Nebraska. Oregon Trail Discovery of gold in Colorado and Montana promoted Nebraska City to a central hub for freight between 1858 and 1865 as thousands of wagons transported supplies via the Nebraska City Cutoff of the Oregon Trail west to Fort Kearny. As the shortest distance between Fort Kearny and the Missouri River, this plowed furrow extended over between Nebraska City and Fort Kearny and during the peak of its use in 1865, over of supplies were shipped before the construction of the Union Pacific Railroad provided a superior means of transportation. United States Numbered Highway System US 75 has existed since the inception of the US Numbered Highway System in 1926. In particular, US 75 originally ran from Galveston, Texas, to the Canadian border near Noyes, Minnesota. Specifically, in Nebraska, the highway followed much of the present day corridor between the Kansas state line and Omaha. In Omaha, US 75 turned east to cross the Missouri River into Iowa where it then turned north to travel on the Iowa side of the river to Sioux City, Iowa. At this same time, US 73 entered Nebraska south of Falls City and ran north through Shubert and Howe before terminating at an intersection with US 75. By 1937, US 73 was realigned to meet US 75 near Dawson. The two highways then ran concurrently north into Omaha where US 75 turned east to cross the Missouri into Iowa. Meanwhile, US 73 continued north to Tekamah where it split into US 73W and US 73E designations. The former traveled west through Craig to Oakland where it met up with US 77 and ran concurrently to south of Winnebago. US 73E ran north through Decatur and Macy meeting up with US 73W and US 77 near Winnebago. Here US 73 and US 77 continued concurrently to South Sioux City. Between 1970 and 1972 the US 73 designation was truncated back to Winnebago removing the concurrency with US 77. US 75 transfer between Iowa and Nebraska The Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 introduced the Interstate Highway System to the United States and the plan called for a highway along the eastern bank of the Missouri River along and parallel to the existing US 75 corridor. Construction began in the late 1950s near Sioux City and Council Bluffs on what would become the Interstate 29 corridor in Iowa. As portions of the new interstate were completed the US 75 designation was moved off its two-lane highway onto the Interstate. In 1984, proposals to AASHTO by the Nebraska Department of Roads recommended truncating the designation of US 73 on its northern end back to Dawson. At the same time, the Iowa Department of Transportation, jointly with NDOR, suggested removing the US 75 designation from the I-29 corridor in Iowa and assigning it to the former US 73 route north of Dawson in Nebraska. The changes were approved during the May 23, 1984 meeting and the transfer was made official on December 5, 1984. Interstate 580 The limited access portion of US 75 north of Interstate 480 is currently known as the North Freeway. In 1976, the Department of Roads applied to the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials to assign this route as Interstate 580. This designation was approved during the July 13, 1976 annual meeting. The official state highway maps from 1980 and 1981-1982 and official state traffic flow maps from 1977 and 1979 also show the Interstate 580 designation along the North Freeway, but it was not present in highway maps after 1982 or traffic flow maps after 1979. Originally, the route was planned to extend north and terminate with Florence Boulevard. Plans from the 1960s extended the highway north through Florence to I-680. The I-580 designation was dropped when the state refused to upgrade the I-480/580 interchange to interstate standards. Part of the original plans to extend the freeway to Florence Boulevard came to fruition when the Storz Expressway met Florence Boulevard at a partial interchange before continuing on to Eppley Airfield.

It was wrongly listed as carcinogenic in the Villejuif leaflet. The rumour started in France and quickly spread across Europe, the Middle East, and Africa The Villejuif leaflet, also known as the Villejuif flyer and the Villejuif list, was a pamphlet which enjoyed wide distribution. The leaflet listed a number of safe food additives with their E numbers as alleged carcinogens. The leaflet caused mass panic in Europe in the late 1970s and 1980s. One of the entries on the list was citric acid (E330). Its name derives from its false claim to have been produced at the hospital in Villejuif. History The earliest known sighting of the leaflet was in February 1976, in the form of a single typewritten page in France. Homemade copies were spread across Europe for a decade in the form of a leaflet or flyer pamphlet that was distributed between friends and apart from citric acid included 16 other chemicals in a list of substances that it called dangerous toxins and carcinogens. The original author of the typewritten list was never found, and the leaflet affected about 7 million people in its uncontrollable propagation. In a survey of 150 housewives, 19% said they have stopped buying these brands, and 69% planned to do so.Anthony Pratkanis, Elliot Aronson, Age of propaganda: the everyday use and abuse of persuasion, Mcmillan, 2001, , pages 111-112 List contents Multiple versions of this leaflet circulated, the exact set of suspect and dangerous substances differing from version to version.

N. Kapferer, president of the Foundation for the Study and Information on Rumors (an organisation in Paris, France) and professor of communication at L'Ecole des Hautes Etudes Commerciales and l'Institut Sup√©rieur des Affaires (a university in France) because of its persistence contrary to all official denials about the safety of citric acid and its wide distribution, as about half of all French housewives had been exposed to it. The resulting scientific paper was published in 1989 in the 53rd volume of the Public Opinion Quarterly, a journal associated with the American Association for Public Opinion Research and published by the University of Chicago Press (now published by the Oxford University Press). According to a 1990 book also written by Jean-No√´l Kapferer, the leaflet drew the attention of experts, who immediately recognised its dubious nature. The leaflet wrongly listed E330, citric acid, as the most dangerous of all carcinogens. Spread The rumour, considered one of the most important experienced in the French society, spread via a translated leaflet in Great Britain, Germany, Italy, the Middle East, and Africa. Journalists working for newspapers distributed the list of alleged carcinogens verbatim; even a 1984 book written by a medical doctor aiming at informing the general public about the dangers of cancer included the substances in the flyer in a list of carcinogens, without checking the flyer's accuracy. False connection with the hospital of Villejuif It was reproduced many times by many individuals as friends sought to inform other friends of the harmful chemicals in their food, and in the course of uncontrolled copying a version of the leaflet included the name of the Villejuif Hospital, making victims to the rumour believe that the list was authorised by it. Even though the hospital (as Gustave-Roussy Institute) denied any association, it was unable to stop the further dissemination of the flyer, which went on from hand to hand until at least 1986 and was passed to elementary schools, organisations, and even various hospitals, while medical schools and pharmacy schools also fell victim to the list because of its (unauthorised and untrue) reference to the well-known hospital of Villejuif. Possible explanations Citric acid is important for a chemical process named Krebs cycle, but Krebs means cancer in German, and it has been suggested that this linguistic confusion may have been responsible for false claims that citric acid is carcinogenic.E330 Citric acid See also * Chemophobia References Urban legends False documents Hoaxes in France Hoaxes in science 1970s hoaxes Villejuif ","title":"Villejuif leaflet"},{"id":"19168381","text":"KMA could refer to: *Kanpur metropolitan area, in India *KMA (AM), a radio station (960 AM) licensed to Shenandoah, Iowa, United States *KMA-FM, a radio station (99.1 FM) licensed to Clarinda, Iowa, United States *KMA (art), a collaboration between media artists Kit Monkman and Tom Wexler * Knoxville Museum of Art in Knoxville, Tennessee *Kent Miners' Association *Koninklijke Militaire Academie, the Royal Dutch Military Academy *Korea Military Academy, South Korea *The Korea Meteorological Administration, South Korea *Korea Medical Association, South Korea *Kursk Magnetic Anomaly *Kerala Mathematical Association, Kerala, India *Korean martial arts *Kumasi Metropolitan Assembly * KMA, IATA airport code of Kerema Airport in Papua New Guinea ","title":"KMA"},{"id":"19168386","text":"The Good Food & Wine Show is Australia's largest consumer exhibition.

Hercynian massifs are olive coloured. Geologic map of the Armorican Massif and surrounding areas. The Armorican Massif (, ) is a geologic massif that covers a large area in the northwest of France, including Brittany, the western part of Normandy and the Pays de la Loire. It is important because it is connected to Dover on the British side of the English Channel and there has been tilting back and forth that has controlled the geography on both sides. Its name comes from the old Armorica, a Gaul area between the Loire and the Seine rivers. The massif is composed of metamorphic and magmatic rocks that were metamorphosed and/or deformed during the Hercynian or Variscan orogeny (400 to 280 million years ago) and the earlier Cadomian orogeny (650 to 550 million years ago). The region was uplifted when the Bay of Biscay opened during the Cretaceous period. The Cantabrian Mountains and the Armorican Massif were then rift shoulders of the Bay of Biscay. The competent old rocks of the Armorican Massif have been eroded to a plateaulike peneplain. The highest summit, the Mont des Avaloirs (Mayenne d√©partement), is just above sea level. The western part of the Armorican Massif (which covers Brittany) are the Monts d'Arr√©e. Geology During the Neoproterozoic, older parts of the Armorican Massif formed the northern margin of the paleocontinent Gondwana. During the Paleozoic era, the Armorican Massif was part of the microcontinent Armorica, which probably also included terranes found in the Vosges, Black Forest and Bohemian Massif further east. Armorica rifted off the northern margin of Gondwana somewhere during the Ordovician or Silurian periods to move northward and collide with Laurussia during the Hercynian orogeny. The oldest rocks of the massif are Neoproterozoic sediments of the Brioverian Supergroup which were deformed and metamorphosed during the Cadomian orogeny. These are overlain by lower Paleozoic (Cambrian to Devonian) (meta-)sediments. The whole sequence was deformed, metamorphosed and intruded by felsic magmas during the Hercynian orogeny. The massif is cut in three by two major late Hercynian southeast-northwest striking shear zones (the North and South Armorican Shear Zones). The divisions are simply called the North, Central and South Armorican Zones. Generally the north was less deformed during the Hercynian orogeny than the south. The South Armorican Zone is considered part of the core of the Hercynian orogeny, comparable to the Moldanubian Zone of southern Germany and central Europe. Late Hercynian granitoid bodies were intruded along the South Armorican Shear Zone. The northern parts of the Armorican Massif have less intrusive rocks, although a small zone in the northwest of Brittany (L√©on Zone) forms an exception. The site of the \\"Roche d'O√´tre\\".

Design and history These guns were originally fitted to the obsolete armored ship SMS Oldenburg, which had been disarmed when it was converted to a target ship about 1912. One obvious change made for land service was the placement of a large counterweight just forward of the trunnions to counteract the preponderance of weight towards the breech. This, although heavy, was simpler than adding equilibrators to perform the same function. Four were fitted in 1918 to the railroad and firing platform mounts (Eisenbahn und Bettungsschiessger√ºst) (E. u. B.) designed for the 24 cm SK L/40 \\"Theodor Karl\\". This was fairly simple, but required an even larger counterweight to compensate for the older gun's shorter barrel and greater weight.Fran√ßois, p. 36 The E. u. B. could fire from any suitable section of track after curved wedges were bolted to the track behind each wheel to absorb any residual recoil after the gun cradle recoiled backwards. It also had a pintle built into the underside of the front of the mount. Two large rollers were fitted to the underside of the mount at the rear. Seven cars could carry a portable metal firing platform (Bettungslafette) that had a central pivot mount and an outer rail. It was assembled with the aid of a derrick or crane, which took between three and five days, and railroad tracks were laid slightly past the firing platform to accommodate the front bogies of the gun. The gun was moved over the firing platform and then lowered into position after the central section of rail was removed. After the gun's pintle was bolted to the firing platform's pivot mount, the entire carriage was jacked up so that the trucks and their sections of rail could be removed. The carriage was then lowered so that the rear rollers rested on the outer track. Concrete versions were also used. It could have up to 360¬∞ of traverse. The E. u. B. mount retained 4¬∞ of on-mount traverse for fine aiming adjustments.Miller, pp. 475-6, 484 Breech, cradle, loading tray and shell tongs of a \\"Theodor Otto\\" Ammunition Ammunition was moved by means of an overhead rail from which a pair of shell tongs lifted up individual shells to be placed in the loading tray fixed to the breech. An extensible rail could be raised and braced in place to allow the tongs to reach shells placed on the ground or in an ammunition car behind the mount.Miller, p. 484 The gun had to be at zero elevation to load and thus it had to be re-aimed after every shot. The \\"Theodor Otto\\" fired several different shells with weights between . It used the German naval system of ammunition, where the base charge was held in a metallic cartridge case and supplemented by another charge in a silk bag which was rammed first.Kosar, p. 42 Combat history Little is known of their service, although the Americans captured one in November 1918.

It formed as an independent, intraoceanic volcanic arc during the Paleozoic and Mesozoic. Stikinia forms the bedrock of numerous volcanoes in the southern portion of the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province (NCVP), a Miocene to Holocene geologic province that has its origins in continental rifting.  Extent  Until recently the Paleozoic rocks that form a non-continuous belt along the western margin of the NCVP (the Stikine assemblage) were only recognized in a restricted area in northern British Columbia, between the Stikine River and Taku River areas. In contrast, Mesozoic Stikinia rocks form a near-continuous belt that extends much farther to the north, leading some authors to question the nature of the unexposed Paleozoic basement north of the Taku River area. The following correlations have significant implications for tectonic reconstructions of the northern Cordillera because they suggest that Stikinia's Paleozoic volcanic- sedimentary basement is more widespread than previously thought.  Formation  On the basis of similar rock types and lithologic associations, six new uranium-lead zircon dates, and the common intrusive relationship with 184‚Äì195 million year old plutons, the Stikine assemblage is correlated with the Boundary Ranges suite, a metamorphosed Paleozoic volcanic assemblage exposed in the Tagish Lake area, north of the Taku River and south of the Yukon‚ÄìBritish Columbia border. The recognition of the Boundary Ranges suite and the Jurassic plutons that intruded it (Tagish Lake suite) as part of Stikinia has implications for the age and character of the Stikinia‚ÄìTracy Arm terrane boundary because the Boundary Ranges and Tagish Lake suites form the footwall of a major Middle Jurassic shear zone that carried the continental margin‚Äìlike rocks of the Tracy Arm terrane in its hanging wall. This correlation also implies that the late Paleozoic basement to the Mesozoic Stikinia arc is not a continental margin assemblage, at least as far north as the British Columbia‚ÄìYukon border, and possibly farther. The Boundary Ranges suite, and therefore the Stikine assemblage, are also tentatively correlated with parts of the Yukon‚ÄìTanana Terrane in Yukon (Aishihik Lake area), parts of the Taku terrane in southeast Alaska, and undivided metamorphic rocks in west- central British Columbia. Differences in the isotopic signatures of these rocks may reflect along-strike changes in the character of the basement rocks of the late Paleozoic Stikinia volcanic arc.

Life Frederick Augustus succeeded his father in Anhalt-Zerbst in 1747, at the age of thirteen. His mother, the Dowager Princess Johanna Elisabeth, acted as regent on his behalf until 1752. He was one of the sovereigns who supported Britain in the American Revolutionary War with soldiers. For this, he received a substantial monetary compensation. In 1776 he granted religious tolerance in his lands. Due to a quarrel with the Kingdom of Prussia, he was forced to flee into exile in Basel and later Luxembourg, where he died.

She had been built as SS West Avenal for the United States Shipping Board (USSB) as part of the West boats, a series of steel-hulled cargo ships built on the West Coast of the United States. West Avenal was launched in October 1918 by the Western Pipe and Steel Company of San Francisco, California, and delivered to the US Navy when she was completed in February 1919. After she was commissioned and had taken on a load of flour, West Avenal sailed to Norfolk, Virginia, where she was decommissioned in early April. Though little is available regarding West Avenals civilian career, she is known from contemporary news account to have visited ports in Spain, Italy, France, Brazil and Uruguay in the early 1920s. In January 1920, West Avenal was rammed by a British cargo ship in New York Harbor and was grounded to prevent her sinking. By late 1928, West Avenal had been abandoned by the USSB, and was scrapped in August 1929.  Design and construction  The West ships were cargo ships of similar size and design built by several shipyards on the West Coast of the United States for the United States Shipping Board (USSB) for emergency use during World War I.

The ship was , and was long (between perpendiculars) and abeam. West Avenal had a steel hull and a deep hold. She displaced 12,200 t, and had a deadweight tonnage of . In common with the first eight ships built by Western Pipe & Steel, West Avenal was powered by a single General Electric steam turbine rated at 2,500 shaft horsepower, that drove a single screw propeller, and moved the ship at a pace. These General Electric turbines proved unreliable and most of the ships powered by them were either lost or scrapped by the end of the 1920s. Later vessels of the same type built by WPS for the USSB were powered by much more reliable Joshua Hendy triple expansion steam engines, and had considerably longer service lives.Mawdsley, pp. 8-10.  Career  West Avenal (ID-3871) was commissioned into the Navy on 1 February with Lieutenant Commander Franz Patterson, USNRF, in command. West Avenal took on an initial load of flour and departed San Francisco on 17 April for New York. She soon developed a steering gear problem and put in at San Diego for repairs. After getting underway again, she transited the Panama Canal and, cutting short her journey, arrived at Norfolk, Virginia, on 4 April. There she was decommissioned the next day and returned to the USSB. West Avenal departed Norfolk on a voyage to Leith, Scotland on 9 April 1919, but was forced to return to port after suffering an engine breakdown. Following repairs, she made several voyages between the East Coast of the United States and various destinations in South America, Spain, France and England. A few mentions of the ship crop up in contemporary news accounts. In August 1919, for example, The New York Times shows West Avenal slated for departure to Buenos Aires, Argentina, on 12 August. The following January, the newspaper reported that West Avenal was rammed by the British Leyland Line cargo ship Lacastrian. Departing New York in a dense fog on the morning of 9 January 1920 for Antwerp, Lacastrian rammed into the port side of West Avenal, which was inbound with a load of onions from Valencia, Spain. The damage was severe enough that West Avenals captain ordered her grounded to avoid sinking in New York Harbor. More than two weeks later, The Washington Post printed a photograph of West Avenal, still grounded off the Red Hook flats. Another report in the Times a year later showed her arrival in Saint-Nazaire, France, on 13 August 1920. In January 1921, The Atlanta Constitution ran a travelogue of a local man who had sailed on West Avenal to South America in August 1919. During his travels, West Avenal had departed the US on 27 August and called at Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands; Rio de Janeiro (where the ship arrived on 24 September)West Avenal arrived at Rio de Janeiro the same day King Albert and Queen Elisabeth of Belgium arrived there. Santos in Brazil; and Montevideo, Uruguay. Another report in The New York Times the following year listed West Avenals arrival in Genoa, Italy, on 19 January 1921. West Avenal underwent further repairs in 1921, after which she was laid up by the USSB in the Staten Island Reserve Fleet 3 Section 1. The vessel was delivered at New York City to the Union Shipbuilding Company of Baltimore, Maryland for scrapping on 29 August 1929.  Notes   References   Bibliography  Mawdsley, Dean L.

It is a formerly all-boys, but now coeducational (since 1979) magnet public high school, the third oldest public secondary school in America (founded 1839 on former Courtland Street in downtown Baltimore, and eventually relocated to the 33rd Street building, its eighth location, nicknamed \\"The Castle on the Hill\\" in 1928). City College is a massive stone structure, with a 150-foot bell tower in the Collegiate Gothic Revival style architecture. A historic and architectural landmark and the capstone of the Baltimore City Public Schools system, the City College boasts many famous successful alumni and distinguished faculty. The academic campus on \\"Collegian Hill\\" replaced '\\"Abbottston'\\" in 1926-1928, the 1870s Victorian- era mansion and hilltop estate of Horace Abbott (1806-1887), the Canton waterfront iron works/foundry owner from the American Civil War era of 1861-1865. When later inherited by his married daughter after his death, the mansion was known as the Gilman-Cate estate. The well known foundry which supplied material for the revolutionary new ironclad warships of the Union Navy, was located at Boston and Hudson Streets.  Lake Montebello  33rd Street ends at Hillen Road and Lake Montebello, an oval artificial retention pond with a surrounding decorative iron-bar fence that is part of the Baltimore City and surrounding Baltimore County and Anne Arundel County metropolitan public water system. The lake is fed by underground conduits from Loch Raven Reservoir, several miles north and the adjacent Montebello Water Filtration Plant, of Italianate style in dark red brick and green tile roofs built 1913.  Former Landmarks   Stadiums  33rd Street passes to the north of an area where two historic stadiums were built in succession. In 1922, Municipal Stadium (also known as \\"Baltimore Stadium\\" and \\"Venerable Stadium\\") was built as a football only bowl on the site of the former larger Venable Park. Municipal Stadium was later only 27 years later, demolished in 1949, and the following year (1950) Memorial Stadium was beginning reconstruction and built in its place with an added upper deck, completed in 1954 for both football and baseball. Memorial Stadium was demolished in 2002. While these stadiums were active, the name \\"33rd Street\\" was synonymous with the professional sports teams that played in this northeast Baltimore neighborhood between Waverly to the west and Coldstream-Homestead-Montebello to the east, and Ednor Gardens-Lakeside to the north, being the homes of major league baseball's Baltimore Orioles (1954 to 1991), the National Football League's Baltimore Colts (1950 and 1953‚Äì1983), the Canadian Football League's Baltimore Stallions (1994 & 1995) and the NFL's Baltimore Ravens (1996 & 1997). Old Municipal and successor Memorial Stadiums also served as an occasional high school and college football \\"home\\" venue for the Terrapins of the University of Maryland at College Park, the Midshipmen of the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis (including hosting the Navy‚ÄìNotre Dame football rivalry and the Army-Navy Game multiple times), and the Bears of nearby Morgan State University. 33rd Street was also home to two of the nation's oldest high school football rivalries, with the annual \\"Turkey Bowl\\" (Calvert Hall College vs. Loyola Blakefield / Loyola High School) and \\"City-Poly Game\\" (Baltimore City College vs. Baltimore Polytechnic Institute) played each year on Thanksgiving Day at Memorial Stadium. The section of 33rd Street in front of the stadium was renamed \\"Babe Ruth Plaza\\" in honor of famous Baltimore baseball player George Herman (\\"Babe\\") Ruth (1895-1948), who played for the Baltimore Orioles, Boston Red Sox, and finally New York Yankees.  Montebello  On the north side of 33rd Street, near the intersection of 33rd and The Alameda, was the Federal-styled mansion and estate of Montebello, named after the European battle. Built in 1799, it originally belonged to Samuel Smith, a famous city merchant/financier, U.S. Representative, U.S. Senator, Mayor and commanding Major General of Maryland State Militia during the War of 1812 and the Battle of Baltimore. It was razed circa 1907.

It is one of the few public schools in the prefecture that does not have a school uniform. Until the 1970s, the school enjoyed prestigious position after Urawa High School and Urawa Ichijo High School. During the 80s and 90s, it was known as one of the best public schools and sent its alumni to best colleges in Japan including Tokyo University. Many applicants to the school are attracted by the no school uniform policy and by the liberal atmosphere that encourages students' independence. Location The school is located in Urawa-ku, Saitama City and situated in a quiet residential area behind the idyllic scene of Minuma. The closest train station, JR Yono Station, is within walking distance: 20 minutes (1.7 kilometers). History In 1934, Urawanishi High School was founded as a female school called . The school changed its name to in 1948. In 1950, Educational Reform abolished the prior policy and restarted the school as a coed institution with the current school name, Urawanishi High School. During this period, the institution was located at the western part of Urawa-ku (former Urawa City). In 1956, the school moved to its current site. This resulted in the inconsistency that the school name, which literally means Urawa Western High School, does not signify the school location. Extracurricular activities Urawanishi's 22 varsity athletic teams and 23 other clubs offer a wide range of opportunities for extracurricular activities. In the past, the school was known for its Soccer Team, which won the national title twice in 1956 and 1965. In recent years, Japanese Archery Team and Basketball Team have won many titles at the prefectural and regional levels.

As a political cartoonist at The Guardian newspaper for 25 years, Gibbard became the longest- serving artist of his type in the publication‚Äôs history.Gibbard at the Guardian: 1969 to 1994, The Guardian, 2005 In addition to his contributions to the Guardian, Gibbard‚Äôs work also featured in the Daily Mirror, the Daily Sketch, The Daily Telegraph, The Sunday Mirror, The London Evening Standard, Time Out and Melody Maker.Biography at the British Cartoon Archive , University of Kent Early life Gibbard was born in Kaiapoi, New Zealand; he grew up in New Zealand and learnt his trade under the tutelage of Gordon Minhinnick (himself influenced by David Low), a former political cartoonist with the New Zealand Herald. After working for a number of New Zealand and Australian publications during the 1960s, Gibbard moved to London and was initially employed by The Daily Telegraph before joining The Guardian in 1969, replacing Bill Papas. At the time he joined, Gibbard was the youngest cartoonist in the paper‚Äôs history at 23. The Guardian (1969‚Äì1994)  While working at The Guardian, Gibbard produced a number of striking cartoons and courted controversy during the Falklands War with a re-working of a Philip Zec cartoon \\"The price of petrol\\" which previously caused uproar during World War II.Published in March 1942 in The Daily Mirror, the cartoon depicted a torpedoed merchant seaman hanging onto a life raft. The caption read: \\"The price of petrol has been increased by one penny: Official.\\" Intended to show that the public should use fuel sparingly as it was costing lives to bring it across the North Atlantic, the illustration angered Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, who contemplated having the paper shut down. Home Secretary, Herbert Morrison viewed the piece as a veiled attack on the ‚Äúprofit-seeking‚Äù oil companies stating: ‚ÄúVery artistically drawn, witty - Goebbels at his best. It is plainly meant to tell seamen not to go to sea to put money in the pockets of the petrol owners.‚Äù from Contentious Cartoon by Dr Tim Benson Responding to the sinking of General Belgrano, on 6 May 1982 the newspaper ran Gibbard's version of the cartoon, re-captioned with the line: \\"The price of sovereignty has increased - official\\". Gibbard later stated: \\"I was unaware of the furore caused by it until I returned home later the following day to barrage of phone calls asking me how I proposed responding to being called a traitor.\\" The cartoon was raised in the House of Commons and was cited as evidence, by the then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher that the British media did not support military action, and rival newspaper The Sun also accused Gibbard and The Guardian of treason: \\"What is it but treason for The Guardian to print a cartoon, showing a British seaman clinging to a raft... isn't that exactly calculated to weaken Britain's resolve at a time when lives have been lost, whatever the justice of her cause?\\" The criticism in turn led to The Sun‚Äôs leader-writer being ejected from the National Union of Journalists for ‚Äúunfraternal behaviour‚Äù. Later life and death Gibbard worked as an animator and produced his own animated political cartoon series Newshound for Granada television. He also provided illustrations for the popular New Zealand social commentary book, The Half Gallon Quarter Acre Pavlova Paradise. Gibbard drew political cartoons for Channel 4's A Week in Politics and for BBC‚Äôs Newsnight and he produced weekly cartoons for political comment show On the Record between 1988 and 1995. He has also contributed to a number of international animated features including The Super Globetrotters, Under Milk Wood and Ivor the Invisible. He died on 10 October 2010 of a pulmonary embolism following a routine operation for knee replacement.

Plot  In the political chaos of Argentina during the final days of Juan Domingo Per√≥n's presidency, a gang of political operatives arrives at the house of Cosme (Reguerraz), a member of the Peronist Youth. Cosme's father has just died of a heart attack and the family is holding a vigil. The gang reveals that Per√≥n has died, news that has not yet reached the public. Their leader, Aldo (Alegre) slowly works on building up Cosme's political fervor, before demanding a favor: they want to swap Per√≥n's body, which they have stolen, with the body of Cosme's father. The idea is to make sure the military authorities never learn about the theft, and to keep Per√≥n's body for themselves as a shrine.

A common example is as follows: On a panel of three judges, only one feels strongly about the decision. One of the two remaining may side with the first judge, leaving the third judge with the option of dissenting on an issue they do not feel strongly about or siding with the majority.Posner, Richard A How Judges Think Harvard University Press 2007 pg 32 Judges dislike dissent for many reasons. Dissent aversion can come from these sources: *It frays collegiality (judges have to work together in the future). *It magnifies the majority opinion. *It is additional work. *It detracts from the significance of their own majority opinions. Dissent is more frequent in US federal courts of appeals where the number of judges is higher. According to some research, this is because the larger the court, the less frequently judges must work with each other and accordingly have less incentive to extend courtesy and favors.Stefanie Lindquist \\"Bureaucratization and Balkanization: The Origins and Effects of Decision Making Norm in the Federal Appellate Courts\\".

Desiderio United States Army Reserve Center on Westminster Drive in Pasadena, California. Organization Although assigned to the Army Reserve, the 140th Military intelligence Battalion was the organic military intelligence battalion of the 40th Infantry Division (Mechanized) of the California Army National Guard. The battalion's numerical designation followed U.S. Army custom of adding 100 to the supported infantry division's number; see also: the 1st Infantry Division's former 101st Military Intelligence Battalion and the 4th Infantry Division's former 104th Military Intelligence Battalion; cf: comparable battalions in armored divisions would have a number 500 greater than the division. The battalion was composed of: * Headquarters & Headquarters Services Company * Company A (Collection & Jamming) * Company B (Intelligence & Surveillance) * Company C (Electronic Warfare) * Detachment D (Long Range Surveillance) [The LRSD was assigned to the California Army National Guard during peacetime.] * 1986‚Äì1989: 307th Military Intelligence Company [The 307th, in Pasadena, was assigned to the 140th only for peacetime command and control]. * 1989‚Äì1995: 651st Military Intelligence Company (Interrogation & Exploitation) (Echelons Above Corps) [The 651st, in Pasadena, was assigned to the 140th only for peacetime command and control]. Training challenges As the 40th Infantry Division's primary wartime trace was to the Eighth United States Army and the defense of South Korea, the 140th Military Intelligence Battalion was configured to specialize in the Korean and Mandarin Chinese languages. Obtaining and retaining language-qualified reserve soldiers in Southern California proved difficult. Modest gains were made with the Army Reserve's institution of the Military Intelligence Special Training Element (MISTE, pronounced \\"misty\\") program, in which military intelligence units, including the 140th, were assigned language-qualified, MOS-qualified reserve soldiers (primarily those with prior active duty service) residing hundreds or thousands of miles away. Given the distance to be traveled, the MISTE soldiers would fly in to drill only bi-monthly, usually at Regional Training Site ‚Äì Intelligence (RTS-I) at Hamilton Army Airfield north of San Francisco, California. The MISTE soldiers participated in annual training with the rest of the battalion. Maintaining technical skills was also a problem, as much of the equipment‚Äîsuch as direction-finding trucks, radio intercept trucks, radio jamming trucks, inter alia‚Äîwas prohibitively expensive for the Army to provide just to have it sit in storage twenty-eight days or more per month. Because of likely damage to streets, the battalion's M113 armored personnel carriers, M577 tactical operations center vehicles and M578 recovery vehicles were stored at Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton; the three-hour round trip negated monthly training on the tracked vehicles. When Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990, the four-year-old battalion was neither adequately manned nor trained for mobilization. Even had the battalion been at full, qualified strength, proficiency in Korean and Mandarin would have been of little use in Southwest Asia. Several of the battalion's reserve soldiers, however, were individually cross-leveled into other units and mobilized for Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm in 1990‚Äì1991. Mission Battalion 140th MI Battalion color The mission of the 140th Military Intelligence Battalion (CEWI) (HD) was to command, control, staff, plan, and supervise its organic and attached companies which provide direct support intelligence, electronic warfare, non-communications intercept & analysis, human intelligence, counterintelligence, and ground surveillance radar support to the 40th Infantry Division. The battalion was organized with the intent of being able to: * Provide command and control of organic, assigned and attached elements in a manner responsive to the needs of the supported battlefield commander. * Exploit the voice, code, and non-communication transmissions collected by intercept teams. * Interrogate enemy prisoners of war (EPWs), defectors, line crossers and other military and civilian personnel of intelligence or counterintelligence interest. * Conduct counterintelligence operations intended to deny hostile intelligence gathering agencies knowledge of friendly forces' dispositions, capabilities, and intentions, and to provide for the security of friendly forces' operations. * Maintain the enemy order of battle, electronic order of battle, and technical data files. * Conduct offensive electronic warfare operations in support of the overall tactical plan. * Conduct tactical deception plans. * Provide limited maintenance, supply, mess, communications, and other logistical and administrative services to sustain operations on the battlefield. * Conduct long range surveillance in support of the division's operations. * Plan and assist in the coordination of battlefield deception operations for the division. HHS Company branch insignia or shoulder sleeve insignia; no \\"HHS\\", \\"HHC\\", \\"HQ\\" or other headquarters designation was authorized at that time. The Headquarters and Headquarters Services Company contained most of the battalion's analysis, supply, and communications personnel, as well as all of the IEW support, administration, vehicle maintenance, communications maintenance, and food service personnel. Accordingly, unlike a stereotypical battalion headquarters company, the HHS Company of a CEWI battalion comprised over half of the battalion's total authorised strength. The company's missions were to: * Provide command, control and administrative support for the battalion. * Provide command and control for assigned and supporting elements, staff planning, and management of assets, * Provide maintenance of communication, electronics, intelligence & electronic warfare (\\"C-E/IEW\\") equipment, mechanical maintenance, and food service for the battalion. * Provide radio telephone, Radioteletype (\\"RATT\\"), radio, and landline communication traffic support. * Provide planning and execution of deception operations in support of the division. * Provide an intelligence & electronic warfare support element (\\"IEWSE\\") as a liaison to each brigade S-2/3. * Conduct analysis of information received from the platoon operations centers (\\"POCs\\") and other sources. The major items of equipment organic to HHS Company included: * AN/TYQ-5 Data Analysis Central * AN/GRC-122 Radio Teletypewriter Set * AN/TSC-87 Communications Terminal * AN/TSC-58 Telegraph Terminal * AN/UYK-71 Intelligence Data Processing Set Alpha Company Alpha Company guidon Company A (Collection and Jamming) was composed of three C&J; platoons, a radio telegraphy team, and a traffic analysis section. Of the three C&J; platoons, one each was concerned with: * Very High Frequency electronic countermeasures, * High frequency & Very High Frequency electronic countermeasures, or * voice collection The major items of equipment organic to Company A included: * AN/TRQ-37 Radio Receiving Set * AN/PRD-11 Radio Receiver Direction Finding Set * AN/MLQ-34 Special Purpose Countermeasure Receiver/Transmitter System * AN/ULQ-19 Responsive Jammer System (RACJAM) * AN/TLQ-17A Special Purpose Countermeasure Set * AN/GRC-122 Radio Teletypewriter Set * OG-181/VRC Ground Based Communications Jamming System (Piranha) Bravo Company Bravo Company guidon Company B (Intelligence and Surveillance) was divided into two very distinctive platoons. The ground surveillance radar platoon had three squads of scouts to carry, install, and utilise ground surveillance radars to observe enemy vehicle traffic. These three squads would provide GSR support to the division's three manoeuvre brigades. The other platoon, known as the operations support element, was composed of two counterintelligence teams and two interrogation teams. The platoon was designed to conduct enemy prisoner of war interrogation and provide limited counterintelligence support to the division. Because an officer could not become qualified in either counterintelligence or human intelligence unless and until he or she completed the respective military intelligence officer advanced course, Company B was unusual in that the operations support platoon was led by a captain. The major items of equipment organic to Company B were AN/PPS-5A Ground Surveillance Radar Sets. Charlie Company Charlie Company guidon Company C (Electronic Warfare) was built around a large signals intelligence (\\"SIGINT\\") processing platoon composed of an analysis section, three non-communication intercept teams and five master control stations. Outside of the platoon was a radio teletypewriter section. Company C's mission was to: * Provide the division with SIGINT support and electronic warfare support measures; and * Provide the division with additional communications intelligence (\\"COMINT\\") and direction finding (\\"DF\\") capabilities. The major items of equipment organic to Company C included: * AN/TSQ-138 Master Control Set * AN/MSQ-103 Special Purpose Receiving Set (Teampack) * AN/GRC-122 Radio Teletypewriter Set Long Range Surveillance Detachment LRSD guidon Detachment D (Long Range Surveillance) was an airborne infantry detachment, designed to parachute far in advance of friendly lines with radios and sufficient provisions to sustain themselves. Once in position, they were to remain camouflaged, while observing enemy activity and other conditions of intelligence value, and report their findings via radio. 651st MI Company 651st MI Company guidon The 651st Military Intelligence Company (Interrogation and Exploitation) (Echelons Above Corps), designed to support a theatre army, was composed of a document exploitation team, a target exploitation team, a technical intelligence section, and six interrogation & exploitation squads in two platoons. The company's mission was to: * Interrogate enemy prisoners of war, officials, defectors, line crossers and other military and civilian personnel having knowledge and/or of interest to intelligence, counterintelligence, technical intelligence, or electronics & communications. * Examine captured material to determine their intelligence value. Disseminate this information to the units within the theatre of operations. * Perform detailed translations of selected foreign documents and media from target languages into English and from English into target languages. Report and disseminate all information. * Develop plans to exploit the information received through captured material, interrogation of enemy prisoners of war, and other intelligence sources. The major items of equipment organic to the 651st MI Company included: * AN/USS-2 Polygraph * AN/TNH-23 Sound Recorder * KS-99 Camera Set Insignia right Coat of Arms Shield: Azure within an orle argent, in base a pyramid of the like and in chief a sun in splendor issuing to base five lightning flashes or and charged with a globe of the like grid-lined of the first. Crest: That for the regiments and separate battalions of the Army Reserve: On a wreath of the colours, argent and azure, the Lexington Minuteman proper. The statue of the Minuteman, Capt. John Parker (Henry Hudson Kitson, sculptor), stands on the Common in Lexington, Massachusetts. Motto Semper Vigil (Latin for always watchful). Distinctive Unit Insignia The distinctive unit insignia is the shield and motto of the coat of arms. Symbolism Oriental blue and silver gray (white) are the colors associated with military intelligence. The sun represents the Greek god Helios who, according to mythology, could bring all secrets to light; surrounding a globe, it represents the unit's worldwide military intelligence mission. The lightning flashes suggest electronic warfare and communication capabilities. The sun and lightning flashes are gold and allude to California, the \\"Golden State,\\" the unit's home area. The pyramid personifies longevity [ironically] and strength. 140 ","title":"140th Military Intelligence Battalion (United States)"},{"id":"19169390","text":"You Suck At Photoshop is a series of online Photoshop tutorials with adult- themed humor designed by Matt Bledsoe and Troy Hitch of the Big Fat Institute for Advanced Interactive Design; hosted at My Damn Channel. The show started as a one-off parody of instructional videos and became popular almost overnight; since its debut in December 2007, the first episode alone has received over 4.7 million views on YouTube, over 600,000 on My Damn Channel, and garnered national attention in Time Magazine. Show format and subject matter Episodes typically star fictional Photoshop user Donnie Hoyle, who demonstrates tools and techniques in Photoshop, usually on a Macintosh computer. Donnie is a person with severe and chronic personal problems relating to his job, his relationships and disintegrating marriage; various legal problems, career and emotional problems; which tend to weave themselves into the narrative to dark comedic effect. Each episode's title card is further distinguished by a different misspelling which can be interpreted as part of the joke of each episode or is spelled so as to suggest an off-color reference. Further clues to Donnie's state of mind can probably be inferred from the ever-changing desktop wallpaper seen during the demonstration. Despite Donnie's rather intractable life problems, he does manage to demonstrate Photoshop CS3 tools and techniques, such as selecting via Color Range, Curves, and Vanishing Point. Originally intended as a one-off series, YSAP went into a second season due to fan demand. The series went into its second season on My Damn Channel on 27 June 2008, and ended on 31 October 2008. The series has had two spinoffs, a five-episode My Damn Channel series known as Sn4tchbuckl3r's Second Chance, and You Suck At Photoshop (TOP SECRET EDITION!), in which Donnie creates his Photoshop will. The series restarted unofficially on 4 April 2012 with a spinoff called You Rock At Photoshop, starring Ronnie Cox. On 25 April 2012, the official start of You Suck At Photoshop started. Awards The series was awarded two Webby awards; for Best How-To and Best Comedy Series ‚Äì People's Voice. It also won the Streamy award for Best Artistic Concept in a Web Series. Characters * Donnie Hoyle (voiced by Troy Hitch) is the series' main character, tutor, and victim. Starting the series as an unhappily married man, desperately unhappy in his job as dumping manager of a waste-management company called Phebco, he relieves stress by making video tutorials of an application he is a master of ‚Äì Adobe Photoshop CS3. He is so angry, though, that he cannot help but let his discontent over his strife-laden marriage, lack of accomplishment and contempt toward other people who don't know Photoshop as well show through. He suffers from self-hatred and bottled up emotions, which he tries to remedy by making tutorials. He's fighting a losing battle against his lifestyle and typically takes it out on the viewer through scornful comments and sarcasm. His friends betray him, and many plan to kill him, such as Sandy and Sn4tchbuckl3r. At the end of the second-season finale, Donnie is apparently shot by an unknown assailant. The creators of the character have this to say about him, from their Time magazine profile: * Sn4tchbuckl3r (voiced by Matt Bledsoe) is the series' major recurring supporting character, and appears to be Donnie's closest friend and a regular co-player of World of Warcraft. He speaks with what appears to be a Hispanic accent, and both taunts Donnie and seems to also function as his only friendly contact with the world at large. His speech is characterized by what would otherwise be expletives that are cleverly replaced by similarly sounding words (e.g. What the Schmidt!) * Sandy Mehglich (unvoiced) is Donnie's internet divorce-rebound love-interest, the next most important recurring character. She is a prominent plot feature in episodes 7, 8, and 9 from the first season, and 16 from the second. She was introduced to Donnie through a request to \\"hot-up\\" her Facebook picture to appeal to, as she put it, \\"college-boy beef loaf\\". Sandy is also encumbered by two adult children who were, through apparently some sort of prolonged physical abuse involving coffee and special restrictive unitards, stunted to about 65% of normal growth and attempt to make a living as semi-professional go-cart drivers, whom Sandy, out of necessity, manages. In contrast to the other characters who are known only by their voices, Sandy is only known by her (rather flawed) face, a Facebook message to Donnie and her Facebook chat session (where she was in an adjoining room) while Donnie was demonstrating brush settings in episode 16. Additional uncredited characters include Donnie's wife (usually heard heckling him in the early episodes), and Donnie's co-workers at Phebco (heard when he had to do a couple of tutorials from his workplace after legal trouble during his divorce caused him to be locked out of his house). Episode guide  Season One Season One of You Suck at Photoshop was presented on My Damn Channel every other week from 21 December 2007 through 4 April 2008. It comprises 10 regular episodes and one season- ending tribute episode. Donnie's life and career trajectory during this series begin with his portrayal as a man who is both desperately unhappy in his job and his marriage, the progress of his life through is divorce and the loss of his job (whether by firing or quitting is not made clear), and his failed attempt to forge another relationship prior to his rather mysterious disappearance at the end of episode 10. * Episode One ‚Äì You Suck at Photoshop: Distort, Warp and Layer Effects: Donnie uses distort and warp to paste a copy of his marriage license over the driver's side of the van in which his wife was conducting a certain infidelity.

Released 21 March 2008.Episode Nine ‚Äì You Suck a Photosack: Curves * Episode Ten ‚Äì You Suck At Photoshop: Vanishing Point: At the end of his rope, a placid Donnie promises \\"something wonderful is going to happen to you\\", and, in his best Dave Bowmanesque voice, shows the viewer how to use Vanishing Point to create a train big enough to take all his friends to a special place ... and then goes there on his own, mysteriously escaping the SWAT team who have come to evict him from his house. Released 4 April 2008.Episode Ten ‚Äì You Suck At Photoshop: Vanishing Point * Season-ending Tribute Episode ‚Äì A Donnie Hoyle Tribute by Sn4tchbuckl3r: Sn4tchbuckler conference-calls with his Horde colleagues jeffb0yardee and pwnsurm0m (represented, respectively, by avatars depicting Mr. T and Ron Jeremy) and exhorts them to use Photoshop (or, maybe, the GIMP) to produce a suitable tribute to Donnie ... then dissolves the Horde. At the end of the episode we see Sn4tchbuckl3r logging into a new site: Peopleburg. This episode referred to a sidebar on the My Damn Channel site which he ostensibly \\"hacked\\" to allow download of the train track landscape seen in Episode 10 as well as a way to upload graphics as part of a Donnie tribute.Season-ending Tribute Episode ‚Äì A Donnie Hoyle Tribute by Sn4tchbuckl3r Season Two Season Two debuted on My Damn Channel on 27 June 2008, with episode No. 11, and new episodes being released once every other week on Friday. As before, Donnie is at war with his lifestyle and the results of the life choices he's made. Despite his apparent sojourn to Peopleburg (as detailed in the short series Sn4tchbuckl3r's Second Chance and the placidity of his attitude in episode No. 10, he is just as stressed and anxious as he was before. The trajectory of this season starts with a losing paternity battle, the losing of which incites Donnie to do something incredibly stupid involving Thai thumb drives and a NERF jart that invoking Stephen Baldwin can't even save him from, and an apparent cross- country flight from Ricky (aka. the guy \\"drilling\\" his wife in the Vanagon in episode 1). Sna4tchbuckl3r and Sandy make returns to the storyline. *You Suck at Photoshock: Smart Objects: in this episode, Donnie demonstrates the use of Smart Objects and how they can make changing multiple copies of a placed images quick and efficient. He does this in order to demonstrate that a certain child is not actually his. This marked the beginning of the \\"Don't Download Ronnie\\" campaign, in which viewers were negatively encouraged not to download a picture of a sperm cell, nicknamed Ronnie in the video lesson, and not to use it in a Photoshop mashup, which would then be posted to a fan gallery at My Damn Channel. Released 27 June 2008. * Episode 12 ‚Äì You Suck at Protoshop: Measurement Log: In this episode, Donnie explores his daddy issues (and, notably, has the scene from Star Wars where Luke finally confronts Darth Vader as his father) with Measurement Log, a tool so obscure that Donnie claims not even the Photoshop developers know it's there. By comparing a photo of himself as a child and his father as an infant Donnie hopes to \\"measure up\\" favorably; Measurement Log allows one-click recording of measurements and exporting of those measurements. The result is less than Donnie had hoped for. Along with more pleas not to download Ronnie, this episode was released on 11 July 2008. * Episode 13 ‚Äì You Phuck at Sotoshop: Displacement: Donnie's courtroom technique leads to tears ... but with Displacement, which can create a map of the texture of the surface, and can map letters realistically onto a wrinkled soccer jersey, Donnie can live the dream digitally. Released 25 July 2008. * Episode 14 ‚Äì You Suck at Photosho: Video Stuff Reall Fast: Donnie Hoyle is in trouble. After being implicated in a crime (of passion) involving the theft of $70,000 worth of Thai thumb drives and a Nerf jart, Donnie doesn't have time to show you how to use the video features of Photoshop CS3, while he attempts to edit himself out of ten seconds of video camera footage. Released 8 August 2008. * Episode 15 ‚Äì You Suck at Phatoshop: Define Pattern: Donnie has had to skip town fast, and is hiding out in a long-stay motel in an undisclosed location. Everything would be tolerable, however, if it wasn't for the human keg-tapping against the bed wall in the next room. Today, Donnie is going to solve his problems with Photoshop, and show you how to create an infinite soundproofing texture using the Define Pattern tool. This episode features the return of Sn4tchbuckl3r. Released 22 August 2008. * Episode 16 ‚Äì You Suck at Photoshop: Define Brush Preset: Still on the run, Donnie has ended up hiding with Sandy and the littlekins, where a freak accident involving some dangerous growth hormones has changed her...a bit. Donnie hides out in the second room and tries to blow off some steam with Photoshop, showing you the best way to define interesting brush presets. Released 25 August 2008. * Episode 17 ‚Äì You Suck at Photoshart: Automate: Photomerge]: The beginning of this episode reveals that Donnie has moved out of Sandy's house, and has apparently stolen some data that he's left on USB Flash Drives, which have been left in different locations around his home city (which is revealed in this episode to be Covington, Kentucky). Donnie uses the Photomerge feature of Photoshop to compile a map of the flash drive's locations, which he then sends on to Sn4tchbuckl3r to recover. Released 19 September 2008. * You Suck At Photoshop Season 2 Sn4tchbuckl3r PSA: Having not found the drives Donnie located on the map for him, Sn4tchbuckl3r produces an appeal to honesty ‚Äì that of Donnie, who may not have been honest about where the drives were stashed, or any \\"Covington area bottom-feeders\\" who may have beaten him to the drives and taken them to put them up for auction on eBay. The video opens with test color bars and the caption Sn4tchbuckl3r PSA/Peopleburg Liberation Front Communication Network, and displays a Peopleburg in flames, the sky filled with billowing red clouds. Even Sn4tch himself seems the worse for wear. An actual drive was put on auction on eBay with Sn4tchBuckl3r's name on the back which matched his description. The auction has since ended. Released 26 September 2008. * Episode 18 ‚Äì You Suck at Phodioshop: Annotations: Donnie explains how to use the text and audio annotation tools by responding to a threat letter he found on his door. The letter informs him he has until the end of the month to leave the person's house. Released 10 October 2008. * Episode 19 ‚Äì You Sulk at Photoshop: Shadows and Light: Donnie starts this video by opening a photo he has made entirely in photoshop that illustrates the mysery and light in his life. He talks about the \\"Ring of Infinite Sorrows\\" (which is coincidentally the name of the guild created in Peopleburg to take out the current authority and also the ring in episode 4 that Donnie removes) and how the ring has changed his life. Near the end of the video, Donnie calls Sn4tchbuckl3r for the first time to inform Sn4tch that has broken their trust by letting the thumb drives get in the hands of people who put the files on the internet. Donnie then shuts down Peopleburg through a script in Photoshop, and the last thing that can be heard from Sn4tchbuckl3r is, \\"I'm going to kill you Donnie Hoyle. I'm going to kill you.\\" At the very end of the video, Donnie zoom in on the photo to see an old man staring at him through one of the castle windows (similar to the end of Episode 15). Released 17 October 2008. * Episode 20 ‚Äì You Sucjk at Photoshop: Distort, Warp, & Layer Effects: Donnie talks about how the past things he has done in Photoshop all were chain reactions that got started by the very first episode. He informs Ricky that he is sorry, and to \\"enjoy my wife.\\" As he is putting the message on the car's driver side window, another voice tells Donnie that they are going to kill him. The mysterious voice is masked using a phaser and a pitch change. A picture of the actor who voices Donnie can be seen in the background. Many clues are revealed as to who the killer is, but they all lead to many different people. At the very end of the video, Donnie says, My name is Donnie...\\", a gunshot is heard, and then the camera cuts to Dane Cook, wounded and saying in the voice of Donnie, \\"...and you suck at Photoshop.\\" There is a small reference to Dane Cook in the second episode of the series. Released 31 October 2008.  Season Three As of 4 April 2012, My Damn Channel has started showing You Suck At Photoshop series, beginning with an offshoot series called You Rock At Photoshop, starting 4-year-old Ronnie Cox, the possible estranged child of Donnie Hoyle. The offshoot series tends to mimic the original in a happier tone voiced by little Ronnie. Following the first episode, two videos affidavits by Robert Davis-Brockweilder Munghj, the legal representative of the \\"late\\" Donnie Hoyle estate, notifying My Damn Channel that they were in violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act for the blatant copy. The second episode of the You Rock At Photoshop started the same as the second episode of You Suck At Photoshop, but involving removing a robot instead of a cat. During the video, Ronnie Cox received a Skype message from Robert Davis-Brockweilder Munghj regarding how Robert was just attacked by a horde of 4-year-old children which he believed were sent to attack him by Ronnie. During the Skype call, you could hear a group of 4-year- olds breaking into the room where Robert was. There was a third affidavit by Robery Davis-Brockweilder Munghj, where he appeared beaten, bounded and his head was covered. In this video he made mention that Donnie Hoyle was alive and he would return. Soon after, the sounds of 4-year-olds entering the room and attacking Robert occurred. On 25 April 2012, the third season of You Suck At Photoshop started, with Donnie Hoyle creating an advertisement for Robert Davis-Brockweilder Munghj as payment for his services.

His career spanned the difficult period when the theatres were closed during the English Civil War and the Interregnum, from 1642 to 1660. According to James Wright's Historia Histrionica (1699), Clun and Charles Hart were boy players together with the King's Men in the years prior to the theatre closure. Clun was a member of a group of English actors who performed on the Continent, mainly in The Hague and Paris, between 1644 and 1646; he was also one of the former King's Men who tried to restart the company in December 1648, despite the parliamentarian regime's hostility to theatre. (The effort was not successful.)Judith Milhous and Robert D. Hume, \\"New Light on English Acting Companies in 1646, 1648, and 1660,\\" Review of English Studies, New Series, Vol. 42 No. 168 (November 1991), pp. 487-509. In the Restoration era, Clun gained particular notice as the Iago to Nicholas Burt's Othello in the earliest Restoration production of Shakespeare's play in 1660. Clun was among the thirteen actors who were initial sharers in the newly organized King's Company in 1661. In addition to Iago, Clun was strongly associated with the roles of Falstaff, Bessus in Beaumont and Fletcher's A King and No King, Smug in The Merry Devil of Edmonton,John Downes, Roscius Anglicanus, London, 1706; reprinted New York, Benjamin Blom, 1968; p. 75. and Subtle in Jonson's The Alchemist. He also played Cacafogo in Fletcher's Rule a Wife and Have a Wife. Clun may have reached the peak of his career in the title role in Fletcher's The Humorous Lieutenant; the King's Company played that drama for twelve days straight when they opened the lavish new Theatre Royal in Drury Lane in 1663. If so, his peak did not last for long: Clun was killed during a robbery near Kentish Town on the night of 2 August 1664. He was wounded in the arm by the thieves, bound hand and foot, and left in a ditch to bleed to death. Samuel Pepys, who had a strong admiration for Clun's acting, visited the spot of the murder three days after it occurred. He also reminisced in his Diary about Clun's skill onstage. (Pepys criticized Michael Mohun, the actor who took over the role of Iago, for not being as good in it as Clun had been.) After Clun's death, an anonymous verse elegy was published in his memory. The poet reminds his readers that Clun's performances in female roles a quarter-century earlier had \\"made us weep, at seeming sorrow swell, / To see and hear like truth a fiction fell.\\" John Aubrey mentioned Clun in his famous Brief Lives. Aubrey wrote that \\"Ben Jonson had one eye lower than the other, and bigger, like Clun, the player; perhaps he begot Clun.\\"Quoted in: Edwin Nunzeger, A Dictionary of Actors and of Others Associated with the Representation of Plays in England Before 1642, New Haven, Yale University Press, 1929; p. 95 (spelling and punctuation modernized).

Background  Li Kui was born in 711, at the end of the reign of Emperor Ruizong. He was from a prominent clan that, by Li Kui's time, was domiciled in Zheng Prefecture (ÈÑ≠Â∑û, in modern Zhengzhou, Henan) but which traced its ancestry to a line of prominent officials of Northern Wei, who in turn traced their ancestry to Li Fan (), a son of Li Gao, the founder of the Sixteen Kingdoms state Western Liang. (The Tang Dynasty imperial clan also traced its ancestry to Li Gao, through Li Gao's second son and successor Li Xin.) After Northern Wei, Li Kui's ancestors served as officials of Sui Dynasty and Tang Dynasty.New Book of Tang, vol. 72. Li Kui was said to be intelligent, dextrous, and studious in his youth, and he was capable in writing.  During Emperor Xuanzong's reign  Toward the end of Emperor Xuanzong's Kaiyuan era (713-741), Li Kui passed the imperial examinations and was made the sheriff of Chenliu County (Èô≥Áïô, in modern Kaifeng, Henan). After he submitted his writing to Emperor Xuanzong, Emperor Xuanzong, apparently impressed, issued an edict allowing him to work at the legislative bureau of government (‰∏≠Êõ∏ÁúÅ, Zhongshu Sheng) on a trial basis. He was subsequently made You Shiyi (), a junior official at the legislative bureau, and then successively served in the higher offices of You Bujue () and Qiju Lang () at the legislative bureau, and then as Zhi Zongzi Biaosu (), the official in charge of receiving and acting on submissions from members of the imperial clan at the ministry of imperial clan affairs (ÂÆóÊ≠£ÂØ∫, Zongzheng Si). Later, he was promoted to be Sixun Yuanwai Lang (), a junior official at the ministry of civil service affairs (ÂêèÈÉ®, Libu), and then the higher office of Kaogong Langzhong () at the ministry of civil service affairs, in charge of evaluating the officials' performance. He was also involved in drafting edicts for Emperor Xuanzong. After the general An Lushan rebelled in 755 and forced Emperor Xuanzong to flee to Jiannan Circuit (ÂäçÂçó, headquartered in modern Chengdu, Sichuan), Li Kui accompanied Emperor Xuanzong to Jiannan and was made Zhongshu Sheren (), a mid-level official at the legislative bureau.  During Emperor Suzong's reign  Emperor Xuanzong's son and crown prince Li Heng, however, did not follow him to Chengdu and instead fled to Lingwu, where he was declared emperor (as Emperor Suzong), an act that Emperor Xuanzong recognized when he heard the news. After Emperor Suzong recaptured and returned to Chang'an in 757, his wife Empress Zhang became a dominating figure at court. She wanted her son Li Zhao () the Prince of Xing, who was only several years old at that point, to be made crown prince. Emperor Suzong, however, was instead considering his oldest son Li Chu the Prince of Cheng, who had contributed much to his campaigns to recapture Chang'an and the eastern capital Luoyang. Emperor Suzong consulted Li Kui and stated to him, \\"The Prince of Cheng is the oldest and had accomplished much. I want to create him crown prince. What do you think, sir?\\" Li Kui got up and bowed to Emperor Suzong, stating: \\"This is great blessing to the state. I am uncontrollably happy.\\" Li Kui's comments affirmed Emperor Suzong's thoughts, and he created Li Chu crown prince in summer 758.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 220. In spring 759, when the officials who wanted to flatter Empress Zhang proposed that she be given a special honorific epithet of Yisheng (ÁøäËÅñ, meaning, \\"one who assists the holy one\\"). When Emperor Suzong consulted Li Kui on whether this was appropriate, Li Kui opposed, pointing out that the only prior instance when such an epithet was given to a living empress was to Empress Wei, the powerful and corrupt wife of Emperor Suzong's granduncle Emperor Zhongzong. After a lunar eclipse -- which indicated divine displeasure with the empress -- occurred around the same time, Emperor Suzong tabled the proposal. By this point, Li Kui also had the additional office of deputy minister of rites (Á¶ÆÈÉ®‰æçÈÉé, Libu Shilang). He was displeased with how the officials in charge of the imperial examinations at the time were making their testing questions test highly obscure facts, and he believed that this led to the selection of examinees who were not necessarily talented or capable in writing. He therefore, at the examinations, made the Confucian classics, histories, and qieyun references available to the examinees for them to look through the books during examination. He was much praised for this reform. It was also said that Li Kui was handsome in appearance and capable in rhetoric. Emperor Suzong once told him, \\"You, sir, are the highest grade in your clan's prominence, in your appearance, and in your writing.\\"Old Book of Tang, vol. 126. Also in spring 759, Emperor Suzong, as a part of his reorganization of his chancellors, removed Miao Jinqing and Wang Yu from their chancellor posts and replaced them with Li Kui, L√º Yin, Li Xian, and Diwu Qi. In Li Kui's case, he was given the post of Zhongshu Shilang (), the deputy head of the legislative bureau, which was not itself a chancellor post, but given the additional de facto chancellor designation of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (), making him a chancellor. He was also put in charge of editing the imperial history. At that time, there were much banditry within the city of Chang'an itself, and the powerful eunuch Li Fuguo wanted to commission several hundred soldiers from part of the imperial guard corps, the Yulin Army (), to patrol the streets at night. Li Kui opposed this, pointing out that the Yulin Army and another part of the imperial guards corps, the Jinwu Guards (), which were already responsible for patrolling the streets, served as counterweights to each other, and allowing the Yulin Army to patrol the streets throw the balance out of whack. Emperor Suzong agreed and tabled Li Fuguo's proposal. Nevertheless, it was also said that Li Kui did not dare to offend Li Fuguo, and despite the fact that Li Kui's clan was prominent, he bowed to Li Fuguo whenever he saw Li Fuguo, and referred to Li Fuguo as \\"Father Five\\" () (as Li Fuguo was fifth in his birth rank). As chancellor, it was said that Li Kui was capable and decisive, but that he was also grasping onto fame and fortune, drawing criticism for doing so. He was also criticized for the fact that his brother Li Jie () was also capable, but during Li Kui's term as chancellor, was stuck at a position that lacked actual power with Li Kui doing nothing about it. Meanwhile, L√º, who was removed from his chancellor position in 760, was sent out to be the military governor (Jiedushi) of Jingnan Circuit (ËçäÂçó, headquartered in modern Jingzhou, Hubei) and was gaining a good reputation at the position. Li Kui, who did not get along with L√º while both were chancellor, was concerned that L√º might return to the capital to be chancellor again, submitted an accusation that L√º, who had recently had proposed having eight prefectures added to his circuit, was overly ambitious; Li Kui also sent officials to L√º's circuit to try to find faults with L√º. When L√º reported this to Emperor Suzong, Emperor Suzong, displeased, demoted Li Kui to be the secretary general of Yuan Prefecture (Ë¢ÅÂ∑û, in modern Yichun, Jiangxi). (Only after Li Kui was demoted was his brother Li Jie promoted.)  During Emperor Daizong's reign  Several years later -- therefore, therefore likely under the reign of Li Chu (whose name had been changed to Li Yu at that point), as Emperor Daizong (Emperor Suzong having died in 762) -- Li Kui was slightly promoted, to be the prefect of She Prefecture (Ê≠ôÂ∑û, in modern Huangshan, Anhui). However, he would soon be trapped by an action from his past. While he was chancellor, Miao Jinqing had once recommended Yuan Zai for promotion. Li Kui, whose own clan was prominent and who looked down on those with humble origins -- which was the case with Yuan Zai -- refused, and stated to Miao:New Book of Tang, vol. 150 . This caused Yuan to have much resentment toward Li Kui. As Yuan became a powerful chancellor during Emperor Daizong's reign, he gave Li Kui an honorable post with little power or salary -- acting Mishu Jian (), the head of the Palace Library -- and then ordered that Li Kui be sent to the region between the Yangtze River and the Huai River, on the excuse that Li Kui was ill and needed to tend to his illness. It was said that because the position lacked salaries and Li Kui lacked savings, his large household became so poor that members even had to beg for food. Li Kui moved from prefecture to prefecture, as he would move whenever the prefect would dishonor him. Only after Yuan was executed in 777 was Li Kui again given a substantive position -- the prefect of Mu Prefecture (Áù¶Â∑û, in modern Hangzhou, Zhejiang). He later returned to Chang'an to serve as the principal of the imperial university (ÂúãÂ≠êÁõ£, Guozi Jian) and minister of rites (Á¶ÆÈÉ®Â∞öÊõ∏, Libu Shangshu).  During Emperor Dezong's reign  Emperor Daizong died in 779 and was succeeded by his son Li Kuo (as Emperor Dezong). Li Kui continued to serve as minister of rites, but the powerful chancellor Lu Qi was jealous of his reputation and seniority. In 783, after the emissary of the Tibetan Empire Qujiazan () arrived in Chang'an to negotiate a border realignment treaty with Tang and after the treaty was completed, at Lu's instigation, Emperor Dezong made Li Kui emissary to the Tibetan Empire to escort Qujiazan back to the Tibetan Empire. Li Kui, then 72, stated to Emperor Dezong, \\"I do not fear going that far a distance, but I am afraid that I would die on the way and not complete my task.\\" Emperor Dezong, who was saddened by the remarks, told Lu, \\"Li Kui is too old.\\" Lu responded, \\"An emissary to a far-away foreign state needs to have a good reputation. Further, if Li Kui, who is this old, is sent as an emissary, then in the future, no official younger than Li Kui would dare to refuse such a task.\\"Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 228. When Li Kui got to the Tibetan Empire, its king Trisong Detsen asked, \\"I heard that there is a Li Kui who is the most able of officials in Tang. Are you that person, lord?\\" Li Kui was afraid that this meant that Trisong Detsen intended to detain him, and therefore responded, \\"That Li Kui would never be willing to come here.\\" On his way of returning from the Tibetan Empire in 784, he died at Feng Prefecture (È≥≥Â∑û, in modern Baoji, Shaanxi). He was buried with honor and given the posthumous name Gong (ÊÅ≠, meaning \\"respectful\\").

There is no consensus on when this phrase first came into use, although it most likely grew out of the Disability Rights Movement that began in the early 1970s. The concept may have started as a cynical play on existing rule sheets, written for audiences without a disability, that were seen as patronizing by civil rights activists. Guidelines Most disability etiquette guidelines seem to be predicated on a simple dictate: \\"Do not assume ...\\" They are written to address real and perceived shortcomings in how society as a whole treats disabled people. These guidelines can be broken down into the several broad categories. \\"Do not assume ...\\": * \\"... a person with a disability either wants or requires assistance.\\" * \\"... rejection of aid is meant as a personal affront.\\" * \\"... upon acceptance of your help, that you know, without being told, what service to perform.\\" * \\"... a person who appears to have one kind of disability also has others.\\" * \\"... a disabled person is dissatisfied with their quality of life, and is thus seeking pity.\\" * \\"... a person with a disability is easily offended.\\" * \\"... that a person who does not appear disabled, or who uses assistive devices intermittently instead of all of the time, is faking or imagining their disability.\\" (See invisible disability.) * \\"... companions accompanying a person with a disability are there strictly to render service.\\" * \\"... a person with a disability will be receptive to personal questions, particularly in a public setting.\\" * \\"... that when a person with a disability is in a public place, that they are being escorted by a caretaker, instead of traveling alone.\\" Each category encompasses specific \\"rules\\". For example, the last two of these would include guidelines such as: * \\"Ask questions of the person with a disability, and not of their companions.\\" * \\"Hand grocery or other receipts to the individual who is paying the bill.\\" * \\"Only ask questions about the person's disability if you know that person.\\" People writing on specific disabilities have given rise to their own unique guidelines. Wheelchair users may, for example, include the rule, \\"do not grab the push handles of a person's wheelchair without permission.\\" Visually impaired people often list a request to, \\"identify yourself when you enter a room.\\" Language Like many other minority groups, disabled people do not always agree on what constitutes politically correct language. However, see the List of disability-related terms with negative connotations and people- first language.

It was opened in February 2004 by American dealer, Aldy Milliken. Milliken Gallery selects exhibitions based on an artist or artwork's conceptual integrity and market-based qualities. It has produced solo exhibitions with Swedish artists such as Felix Gmelin, Kristina Jansson, Lars NIlsson, Tova Mozard, Matti Kallioinen, and Christine √ñdlund, and foreign artists including Tris Vonna-Michell, Lisi Raskin, Olav Westphalen, and Karl Haendel. The gallery juxtaposes solo shows with group exhibitions to introduce the Swedish public to a variety of artists often seen in Biennales and art fairs internationally. For example, Face Your Demons features internationally recognized artists Zsolt Bodoni, Mircea Cantor, Keren Cytter, Jessica Jackson Hutchins, Josiah McElheny, Goshka Macuga, Aleksandra Mir, Alyson Shotz, Magnus Wallin, and Adrian Williams. While some exhibitions have historic value, (such as the exhibit featuring work by KP Brehmer, a contemporary to Joseph Bueys) others delve into issues surrounding the Visual Arts, exploring ideas like the relationship of Art with Craft and Design. Simple, curated by writers/artists Dr. Ronald Jones and Laurie Makela, included artists such as Andrea Zittel, Rirkrit Tiravanija, and early 20th century painter Hilma af Klint.

He has been profoundly deaf since birth and his deafness developed his strong sense of seeing. His independence began at the age of 14 when he started to live alone in Penang.http://www.kosmo.com.my/kosmo/content.asp?y=2009&dt;=0817&pub;=Kosmo&sec;=Rencana_Utama&pg;=ru_01.htm He received his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from Rochester Institute of Technology, New York. He competed in the second season of the Bravo television network's reality television series Work of Art: The Next Great Artist. Life and work Early life In 1992, Lim moved to Penang, Malaysia for high school, Federation School for the Deaf (later known as SMK Pendidikan Khas Persekutuan). Lim graduated from his high school in 1997 took a De Montfort University of United Kingdom program at the Equator Academy of Art in Penang. After more than two years, Lim received a full five-year scholarship to attend Rochester Institute of Technology. While studying at RIT, Lim discovered his passion for design, photography, film and architecture. After his graduation from RIT, Lim settled in New York City. Early work The Recycled Head Anatomy in George Town, Penang In 1998, Lim created his first sculptural installation, The Recycled Head Anatomy with old objects such as bulbs, broken glasses, steel cans, toys, and electronic and plastic media found around the streets of George Town. That sculpture allowed Lim understand about the possibility of transformation and how one cultural object or gesture may turn into another. In 1999, Lim reached out to various organizations and newspapers for a grant to do his first art project, ‚ÄúWhat is in the Deaf‚Äôs Mind?‚Äù with the help of his former teacher, Vicky Teoh. Teoh had spoken to several representatives of the companies by phone for Lim. He received three sponsors, including 500 cans of acrylic colors from the Hai Kuang Sdn. Bhd, a manufacturer of Pelaka paints; old newspapers and grants from the two local newspapers, The Star (Malaysia) and The Sun (Malaysia). Lim directed 80 deaf students of ages 8‚Äì16 to make a big canvas by using old newspapers and to paint their faces and bodies to express their own worlds onto canvas. Recent work Lim has been creating works ranging from paintings and sculptures to interior/architectural models and graphic design to multimedia and art installations and photographs. The solo voyager, who has traveled to more than 33 countries worldwide, often explores themes of heritage preservation, social segregation, mortality, interactive communication, and the politics of identity and culture. His voyages inspired his work which is an investigation of the diversity of human expression, built environment, sociological experience, and cross-cultural experience. The 3(656) in Rochester, New York The 3(656) in Rochester, New York In addition to his artistic pursuits, Lim has participated in heritage-conservation research and gave a lecture of \\"George Town Contemporary\\" at Penang Heritage Centre, George Town, Penang (Pusat Warisan Pulau Pinang) with the help of Khoo Salma. Also, Lim served as an Art Director and Set Designer in US-based film production for short movies. Current status Lim completed the second season of Work of Art: The Next Great Artist. To date, he is the first deaf contestant and star in any of the Bravo's vaunted 43 reality shows including \\"Top Chef\\", \\"Project Runway\\", and \\"The Real Housewives\\".http://galleristny.com/2011/10/work-of-art- recap-episode-1/ Lim was chosen for Prestige Magazine's November 2011 issue cover for The Art Issue. He was commissioned to create new artwork for two lifestyle magazines; Prestige and Esquire, whose the issues published in November 2011. In addition, his transformative portrait work of Julian Assange, was selected by TIME for its Person Of The Year 2010 edition.http://www.timeoutkl.com/art/articles/Five-minutes-with-Leon-Lim In July 2010, Lim was commissioned by the Penang State Government, George Town World Heritage Incorporated, and Penang Global Tourism, to create a new site- specific, public art installation, The Last Chairs for the George Town Festival 2010 inaugurated in conjunction with the UNESCO World Heritage Site's second anniversary. This exhibition marked Penang‚Äôs first public art in its new chapter on Contemporary Art in George Town as well as Lim's first exhibition in his native homeland of Malaysia, after his works have been exhibited in several other countries.http://www.georgetownfestival.com/gtf2011/gtf2010/website/programme_art_01.htm In June 2010, Lim‚Äôs art installations, Silent Story and Discommunicativeness which were exhibited in Washington DC, New York, Seoul and Beijing, were selected again to be part of the inaugural exhibition of the 5th Busan Media Festival in Busan, the second largest city in South Korea. Busan is the home of the Busan Biennale, a well renowned international contemporary art biennale. Lim is one of 17 selected artists from New York City, (including Artist Chuck Close) featured in the 2009 calendar for the Mayor of New York City. Bank of America, Bank of America's Disability Affinity Group, Pitney Bowes and Williams Lea donated their time and effort to help make the calendar a reality. Lim's multimedia installation has been exhibited internationally at Seoul's Total Museum of Contemporary Art, South Korea in July 2008 and Beijing's CAFA Art Museum, China in August 2009. His works have been exhibited at galleries such as the John F. Kennedy Center, Washington DC, the World Financial Center, New York City, Bevier Gallery, Rochester NY and Gallery R, Rochester NY. Lim was commissioned in 2008 to create a permanent art installation, The 3(656) for a study lounge in the new center at Rochester Institute of Technology. The installation is an introduction of Lim's inspiration from the unknown history from the dream of building a college to the reality of a college to Lim's arrival. The grand opening of the installation was launched in May 2008. In an interview with New Straits Times, Lim said, \\"People generally cannot see beyond a deaf person's physical handicap.

Biography Tadeusz Kotz was born in Graban√≥w as Tadeusz Koc on 9 August 1913 to a family of wealthy farmers. After school he entered the cadet flying school in Dƒôblin. Later, he served in the Polish Air Force as a fighter pilot. During the Invasion of Poland in 1939, Kotz fought with the Polish 161st Fighter Escadrille air unit of ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Army. He shot down his first enemy Messerschmitt on 2 September 1939, and also shared in the destruction of a Junkers Ju-86 while piloting a PZL P.11 airplane. On 16 September he shot down a Soviet reconnaissance bomber Polikarpov R-5. After Poland was defeated, Kotz was ordered to evacuate to Romania along with other pilots. He escaped via Yugoslavia and Greece to France, and then to the UK to serve with the Royal Air Force. Commencing in late 1940, Kotz served with No 317, No 308 and No. 303 Squadron, flying the Spitfire. Later, he became a Squadron Leader with No. 303 Squadron. In February 1943 Kotz was shot down in combat with II./JG 26 over Northern France, but evaded capture and returned to England via German occupied France in record timing, Spain and Gibraltar to return to the UK on 21 February 1943.

The aim is the achievement of an adequate and appropriate level of security for IT systems. To reach this goal the BSI recommends \\"well-proven technical, organizational, personnel, and infrastructural safeguards\\". Organizations and federal agencies show their systematic approach to secure their IT systems (e.g. Information Security Management System) by obtaining an ISO/IEC 27001 Certificate on the basis of IT-Grundschutz.  Overview baseline security  The term baseline security signifies standard security measures for typical IT systems. It is used in various contexts with somewhat different meanings. For example: * Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer: Software tool focused on Microsoft operating system and services security * Cisco security baseline: Vendor recommendation focused on network and network device security controls * Nortel baseline security: Set of requirements and best practices with a focus on network operators * ISO/IEC 13335-3 defines a baseline approach to risk management. This standard has been replaced by ISO/IEC 27005, but the baseline approach was not taken over yet into the 2700x series. * There are numerous internal baseline security policies for organizations, * The German BSI has a comprehensive baseline security standard, that is compliant with the ISO/IEC 27000-series  BSI IT baseline protection  The foundation of an IT baseline protection concept is initially not a detailed risk analysis. It proceeds from overall hazards. Consequently, sophisticated classification according to damage extent and probability of occurrence is ignored. Three protection needs categories are established. With their help, the protection needs of the object under investigation can be determined. Based on these, appropriate personnel, technical, organizational and infrastructural security measures are selected from the IT Baseline Protection Catalogs. The Federal Office for Security in Information Technology's IT Baseline Protection Catalogs offer a \\"cookbook recipe\\" for a normal level of protection. Besides probability of occurrence and potential damage extents, implementation costs are also considered. By using the Baseline Protection Catalogs, costly security analyses requiring expert knowledge are dispensed with, since overall hazards are worked with in the beginning. It is possible for the relative layman to identify measures to be taken and to implement them in cooperation with professionals. The BSI grants a baseline protection certificate as confirmation for the successful implementation of baseline protection. In stages 1 and 2, this is based on self declaration. In stage 3, an independent, BSI-licensed auditor completes an audit. Certification process internationalization has been possible since 2006. ISO/IEC 27001 certification can occur simultaneously with IT baseline protection certification. (The ISO/IEC 27001 standard is the successor of BS 7799-2). This process is based on the new BSI security standards. This process carries a development price which has prevailed for some time. Corporations having themselves certified under the BS 7799-2 standard are obliged to carry out a risk assessment. To make it more comfortable, most deviate from the protection needs analysis pursuant to the IT Baseline Protection Catalogs. The advantage is not only conformity with the strict BSI, but also attainment of BS 7799-2 certification. Beyond this, the BSI offers a few help aids like the policy template and the GSTOOL. One data protection component is available, which was produced in cooperation with the German Federal Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information and the state data protection authorities and integrated into the IT Baseline Protection Catalog. This component is not considered, however, in the certification process.  Baseline protection process  The following steps are taken pursuant to the baseline protection process during structure analysis and protection needs analysis: * The IT network is defined. * IT structure analysis is carried out. * Protection needs determination is carried out. * A baseline security check is carried out. * IT baseline protection measures are implemented. Creation occurs in the following steps: * IT structure analysis (survey) * Assessment of protection needs * Selection of actions * Running comparison of nominal and actual.  IT structure analysis  An IT network includes the totality of infrastructural, organizational, personnel, and technical components serving the fulfillment of a task in a particular information processing application area. An IT network can thereby encompass the entire IT character of an institution or individual division, which is partitioned by organizational structures as, for example, a departmental network, or as shared IT applications, for example, a personnel information system. It is necessary to analyze and document the information technological structure in question to generate an IT security concept and especially to apply the IT Baseline Protection Catalogs. Due to today's usually heavily networked IT systems, a network topology plan offers a starting point for the analysis. The following aspects must be taken into consideration: * The available infrastructure, * The organizational and personnel framework for the IT network, * Networked and non-networked IT systems employed in the IT network. * The communications connections between IT systems and externally, * IT applications run within the IT network.  Protection needs determination  The purpose of the protection needs determination is to investigate what protection is sufficient and appropriate for the information and information technology in use. In this connection, the damage to each application and the processed information, which could result from a breach of confidentiality, integrity or availability, is considered. Important in this context is a realistic assessment of the possible follow-on damages. A division into the three protection needs categories \\"low to medium\\", \\"high\\" and \\"very high\\" has proved itself of value. \\"Public\\", \\"internal\\" and \\"secret\\" are often used for confidentiality.  Modelling  Heavily networked IT systems typically characterize information technology in government and business these days. As a rule, therefore, it is advantageous to consider the entire IT system and not just individual systems within the scope of an IT security analysis and concept. To be able to manage this task, it makes sense to logically partition the entire IT system into parts and to separately consider each part or even an IT network. Detailed documentation about its structure is prerequisite for the use of the IT Baseline Protection Catalogs on an IT network. This can be achieved, for example, via the IT structure analysis described above. The IT Baseline Protection Catalog¬ís' components must ultimately be mapped onto the components of the IT network in question in a modelling step.  Baseline security check  The baseline security check is an organisational instrument offering a quick overview of the prevailing IT security level. With the help of interviews, the status quo of an existing IT network (as modelled by IT baseline protection) relative to the number of security measures implemented from the IT Baseline Protection Catalogs are investigated. The result is a catalog in which the implementation status \\"dispensable\\", \\"yes\\", \\"partly\\", or \\"no\\" is entered for each relevant measure. By identifying not yet, or only partially, implemented measures, improvement options for the security of the information technology in question are highlighted. The baseline security check gives information about measures, which are still missing (nominal vs. actual comparison). From this follows what remains to be done to achieve baseline protection through security. Not all measures suggested by this baseline check need to be implemented. Peculiarities are to be taken into account! It could be that several more or less unimportant applications are running on a server, which have lesser protection needs. In their totality, however, these applications are to be provided with a higher level of protection. This is called the (cumulation effect). The applications running on a server determine its need for protection. Several IT applications can run on an IT system. When this occurs, the application with the greatest need for protection determines the IT system¬ís protection category. Conversely, it is conceivable that an IT application with great protection needs does not automatically transfer this to the IT system. This may happen because the IT system is configured redundantly, or because only an inconsequential part is running on it. This is called the (distribution effect). This is the case, for example, with clusters. The baseline security check maps baseline protection measures. This level suffices for low to medium protection needs. This comprises about 80% of all IT systems according to BSI estimates. For systems with high to very high protection needs, risk analysis-based information security concepts, like for example ISO/IEC 27000-series standards, are usually used.  IT Baseline Protection Catalog and standards  During its 2005 restructuring and expansion of the IT Baseline Protection Catalogs, the BSI separated methodology from the IT Baseline Protection Catalog. The BSI 100-1, BSI 100-2, and BSI 100-3 standards contain information about construction of an information security management system (ISMS), the methodology or basic protection approach, and the creation of a security analysis for elevated and very elevated protection needs building on a completed baseline protection investigation. BSI 100-4, the \\"Emergency management\\" standard, is currently in preparation. It contains elements from BS 25999, ITIL Service Continuity Management combined with the relevant IT Baseline Protection Catalog components, and essential aspects for appropriate Business Continuity Management (BCM). Implementing these standards renders certification is possible pursuant to BS 25999-2. The BSI has submitted the BSI 100-4 standards design for online commentary under.Entwurf BSI 100-4 (pdf) The BSI brings its standards into line with international norms like the ISO/IEC 27001 this way.

Assteyn (1607 in Dordrecht - 1669/1677 probably Dordrecht) was a Dutch painter. Bartholomeus Assteyn was the son of a painter from Ghent, Abraham Bartholomeusz. In the year 1631 he became a member in the Dordrecht‚Äôs Saint Lukas painter guild. Assteyn lived with his family in Vriesestraat. In 1651 he was registered as an accountant for the local painter brotherhood. His exact death date is not known; his last authenticated work dates from the year 1669. Assteyn was a productive artist.

Life John Thomas Gilbert was the second son of John Gilbert, an English Protestant, who was Portuguese consul in Dublin, and Marianne Gilbert, an Irish Catholic, daughter of Henry Costello. He was born in Jervis Street, Dublin. His early days were spent at Branackstown, County Meath. He was educated at Bective College, Dublin, and at Prior Park, near Bath, England. He received no university training, as his mother was unwilling for him to attend Trinity College, Dublin - at that time the only university in Dublin. In 1846 his family moved to Blackrock, a Dublin suburb, where he resided until his death, fifty-two years later.Gilbert, Rosa Mulholland. Life of Sir John T.

Aged nineteen, he was elected to the Council of the Celtic Society, and thus became associated with some of the famous writers and orators of the age: Butt, Duffy, Ferguson, Mitchel, O'Hagan, and Smith O'Brien. His essay \\"Historical Literature of Ireland\\" appeared in 1851, and four years later he became a Member of the Royal Irish Academy, and secretary of the Irish Celtic and Archaeological Society, whose members included O'Donovan, O'Curry, Graves, Todd, and Wilde. In 1862 he was awarded the Royal Irish Academy's Cunningham Medal. Taking on the most important posts in the historical and antiquarian societies, he became librarian of the Royal Irish Academy for thirty-four years. In 1891 he married the Irish novelist Rosa Mulholland. He received the honorary degree of LL.D. from the Royal University in 1892, and five years later was knighted for his services to archaeology and history.

War portrays the princess and courtiers of an Italian Renaissance city state setting out for battle. Peace is set in a classical world of order and plenty. It is designed to evoke a sense of beauty rather than illustrate a specific narrative, and depicts a central group of wealthy elegant women dressing while, either side, workmen unload luxurious carpets and ceramics from barges.

The n-back task is a continuous performance task that is commonly used as an assessment in psychology and cognitive neuroscience to measure a part of working memory and working memory capacity.Gazzaniga, Michael S.; Ivry, Richard B.; Mangun, George R. (2009). Cognitive Neuroscience: The Biology of the Mind (2nd ed.). The n-back was introduced by Wayne Kirchner in 1958. Some researchers have argued that n-back training may increase IQ, but evidence is mixed. The task The subject is presented with a sequence of stimuli, and the task consists of indicating when the current stimulus matches the one from n steps earlier in the sequence. The load factor n can be adjusted to make the task more or less difficult. To clarify, the visual n-back test is similar to the classic memory game of \\"Concentration\\". However, instead of different items that are in a fixed location on the game board, there is only one item, that appears in different positions on the game board during each turn. \\"1-N\\" means that you have to remember the position of the item, one turn back. \\"2-N\\" means that you have to remember the position of the item two turns back, and so on. For example, an auditory three-back test could consist of the experimenter reading the following list of letters to the test subject: :T L H C H O C Q L C K L H C Q T R R K C H R The subject is supposed to indicate when the letters marked in bold are read, because those correspond to the letters that were read three steps earlier. The n-back task captures the active part of working memory. When n equals 2 or more, it is not enough to simply keep a representation of recently presented items in mind; the working memory buffer also needs to be updated continuously to keep track of what the current stimulus must be compared to. To accomplish this task, the subject needs to both maintain and manipulate information in working memory. Dual n-back The dual-task n-back task is a variation that was proposed by Susanne Jaeggi et al. in 2003.Jaeggi, S. M., Seewer, R., Nirkko, A. C., Eckstein, D., Schroth, G., Groner, R., et al., (2003). Does excessive memory load attenuate activation in the prefrontal cortex? Load-dependent processing in single and dual tasks: functional magnetic resonance imaging study, Neuroimage 19(2) 210-225. In the dual-task paradigm, two independent sequences are presented simultaneously, typically using different modalities of stimuli, such as one auditory and one visual. Several smart phone apps and online implementations of the Dual N-Back task exist .  Applications   Assessment  The n-back task was developed by Wayne Kirchner for his research into short-term memory; he used it to assess age differences in memory tasks of \\"rapidly changing information\\". =Construct validity= There is some question about the construct validity of the n-back task. While the task has strong face validity and is now in widespread use as a measure of working memory in clinical and experimental settings, there are few studies which explore the convergent validity of the n-back task with other measures of working memory. Those studies have largely revealed weak or modest correlations between individuals' performance on the n-back task and performance on other standard, accepted assessments of working memory. There are two main hypotheses for this weak correlation between the n-back task and other working memory assessments. One proposal is that the n-back task assesses different \\"sub-components\\" of working memory than do other assessments. A more critical explanation is that rather than primarily assessing working memory, performance on the n-back task depends on \\"familiarity- and recognition-based discrimination processes,\\" whereas valid assessments of working memory demand \\"active recall.\\" Whatever the cause of the performance differences between the n-back and other assessments of working memory, some researchers stress the need for further exploration of the construct validity of the n-back task. Performance on the n-back task seems to be more closely correlated with performance on measures of fluid intelligence than it is with performance on other measures of working memory (which is also correlated with performance on measures of fluid intelligence). In the same vein, training on the n-back task appears to improve performance on subsequent fluid intelligence assessments, especially when the training is at a higher n-value.  Treatment  A 2008 research paper claimed that practicing a dual n-back task can increase fluid intelligence (Gf), as measured in several different standard tests.Jaeggi, S. M., Buschkuehl, M., Jonides, J., Perrig, W. J. (2008), Improving fluid intelligence with training on working memory, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, vol. 105 no. 19 This finding received some attention from popular media, including an article in Wired.Alexis Madrigal, Forget Brain Age: Researchers Develop Software That Makes You Smarter, Wired, April 2008 However, a subsequent criticism of the paper's methodology questioned the experiment's validity and took issue with the lack of uniformity in the tests used to evaluate the control and test groups. For example, the progressive nature of Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices (APM) test may have been compromised by modifications of time restrictions (i.e., 10 minutes were allowed to complete a normally 45-minute test). The authors of the original paper later addressed this criticism by citing research indicating that scores in timed administrations of the APM are predictive of scores in untimed administrations. The 2008 study was replicated in 2010 with results indicating that practicing single n-back may be almost equal to dual n-back in increasing the score on tests measuring Gf (fluid intelligence). The single n-back test used was the visual test, leaving out the audio test. In 2011, the same authors showed long-lasting transfer effect in some conditions. Two studies published in 2012 failed to reproduce the effect of dual n-back training on fluid intelligence. These studies found that the effects of training did not transfer to any other cognitive ability tests. In 2014, a meta-analysis of twenty studies showed that n-back training has small but significant effect on Gf and improve it on average for an equivalent of 3-4 points of IQ. In January 2015, this meta-analysis was the subject of a critical review due to small- study effects. A more recent and extended meta-analysis in January 2017 also found that n-back training produces a medium improvement in unrelated n-back training tasks, but a small improvement in unrelated working memory (WM) tasks: The question of whether n-back training produces real-world improvements to working memory remains controversial. =Use in tutoring and rehabilitation= The n-back is now in use outside experimental, clinical, and medical settings. Tutoring companies utilize versions of the task (in conjunction with other cognitive tasks) to allegedly improve the fluid intelligence of their clients. Tutoring companies and psychologists also utilize the task to improve the focus of individuals with ADHD and to rehabilitate sufferers of traumatic brain injury; experiments have found evidence that practice with the task helps these individuals focus for up to eight months following training. However, much debate remains about whether training on the n-back and similar tasks can improve performance in the long run or whether the effects of training are transient, and if the effects of training n-back generalize to general cognitive processing, for instance, to fluid intelligence. Despite the claims of commercial providers, there are some researchers who question whether the results of memory training are transferable. Researchers from the University of Oslo published results of the meta-analytical review analyzing various studies on memory training techniques (including n-back) and concluded that \\"training programs give only near- transfer effects, and there is no convincing evidence that even such near- transfer effects are durable.\\" Neurobiology of n-back task Meta-analysis of 24 n-back neuroimaging studies have shown that during this task the following brain regions are consistently activated: lateral premotor cortex; dorsal cingulate and medial premotor cortex; dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex; frontal poles; and medial and lateral posterior parietal cortex.

XFM, July 02, 2003 Release The narrative is presented as a tour diary for the Northern Irish rock band Ash, but soon reveals itself to be a gorefest. The film features many famous musicians and actors, some playing themselves while others playing specially written characters. The initial idea was given to Shepherd to write a short 'slasher' film for use on the DVD side of the 2002 single release 'Envy'. The film was anticipated by the tabloid and music press but had never officially been released. Due to be released in 2004, to much press hype, Slashed did not appear for reasons unknown. In July 2007, Ash bassist Mark Hamilton let it be known that it was to be uploaded to YouTube as \\"I'm sure some people would want to see Chris Martin getting murdered\\". Initially thought to have been a hoax, a few clips have surfaced over the years to quell the disbelievers. Photos of the filming have also been on Ash and Coldplay websites for years and the long gestation period has not quenched the fans desires to see their favourite artists covered in blood and guts. On May 24, 2010, the first of two Slashed based music videos were released onto the Internet. This six-minute teaser includes scenes featuring Ash, Coldplay, Matt Sharp, Ben Kweller and Charlotte Hatherley.Chris and Jonny's slasher flick appearance unearthed!

Approx 100 people watched mostly Coldplay based scenes, in between narration by Ash's Mark Hamilton and writer Jed Shepherd. There have been internet rumours that based on this screening, there may be an official release at a later date. Cinematic and literary allusions In the film, the supernatural killer is Martha, a young woman murdered on her honeymoon. She comes back from the grave to exact revenge upon a world who destroyed her perfect life. This emulates the narrative of many Japanese Horror which were a big influence on the writer and director. They were also influenced by the films of Troma and many of the sequences employ graphic scenes of gore, nudity and buckets of blood in line with this ethic.

Mary Kassab School In 1916, when the Ottoman authorities ordered the closing of foreign schools, Mary Kassab gathered in her home sixteen boys and girls who were enrolled at the British School and pledged to ensure their continuing education. Parents began to send their children to her, which became the nucleus of Ahliah School. The following year, sixty students were enrolled, and Mary Kassab was authorized to open a national, non-denominational and coeducational school. With the help of her brother Aziz and two of his friends, Boulos Khawli and Anis Makdissi, she formed a board of trustees. The board raised funds from Lebanese and Arab residents and Lebanese emigrants, and were able to purchase the present campus of Ahliah from the Scottish mission. The school embraced the new scouting movement which included all Lebanese children and Alice Abkarios at Ahliah undertook the translation of the scouting rules into Arabic. The Mandate authorities tried to tighten their control over the school and in 1924 they ordered its closing. The students (predominantly girls) organized a rally and walked into the Government Palace to defend the cause of the school before the High Commissioner. The French authorities repealed the decision. Al-Ahliah Girls‚Äô College In 1950, Mary Kassab School became Ahliah Girls‚Äô College. Boys were admitted at the elementary level only. The second principal, Wadad Makdisi Cortas, took office in 1935. A music academy was started, under the leadership of Alexis Boutros. Ahliah's choir represented Lebanon in many capitals of the world, with some one hundred performances on their record. The Ford Foundation equipped the school's science laboratories as a model.  Al Ahliah School in Beirut Situated in the heart of old Beirut, Al-Ahliah found itself at the center of battles during the Lebanese Civil War (1975‚Äì1990) and its buildings sustained heavy damage. The demography of the neighborhood changed dramatically, to include the families of the displaced. Its academic standards also suffered severely because of the departure of many of its faculty and students. For the first and most violent two years of the war, al-Ahliah closed. It reopened in 1977, under the leadership of Mr. Nicholas Zayyat, previously a teacher of mathematics of senior classes at the school. Throughout the war years, the main concerns of Mr. Zayyat together with other members of the school administration were to guarantee the security of students and to preserve the school's buildings and infrastructure. Unable to keep former academic standards, Mr. Zayyat was keen on continuing the humanitarian and patriotic mission of the school by providing education to the numerous severely disadvantaged students and to children of parents reduced by the war to becoming squatters in its vicinity, though often these parents were unable to pay full fees. Eventually wartime Al-Ahliah had 750 students enrolled. By this time it had become coeducational. Despite the dangers and insecurities faced, the idea of moving the school from its historic location was repeatedly rejected by Al-Ahliah's Board of Trustees. Post civil war improvements After the war ended and the country settled back into peaceful times that also witnessed the rebuilding of downtown Beirut, the Board of Trustees of Al- Ahliah began reviving and modernizing its mission. A new principal, Dr. Najla Hamadeh, a graduate of the school's golden age and a member of its Board of Trustees, was appointed to execute its revival. During Hamadeh's tenure (1999‚Äì2005), Al-Ahliah accomplished the following: * changes to the faculty and administration, which led to a considerable improvement in academic standards and services * founding a renewed preschool that employed Montessori techniques and equipment * refurbishing the school buildings, in accordance with Solidere criteria, together with renovation of science laboratories and preschool facilities * closing down the French language section which had been created to satisfy war conditions and needs, in order to focus on building a strong English section, while retaining French as a strong third language * founding an informary, two additional activity halls and a day-care for the infants of faculty and staff * developing a center for students with psychological and educational needs and for remedial and individual academic support Campus The campus consists of two buildings purchased in 1916 from a Scottish mission. The buildings surround an inner courtyard, which serves as a school gathering place and offers space for sports and other activities. Ahliah's buildings were fully renovated in 2003‚Äì2004. The main older building houses the administrative offices on the ground floor. The first floor was completely restored and includes the preschool and the resource room. The second floor has two assembly halls, the information technology lab and the iEARN conference room. Ahliah's second building is a three-winged and three- storied structure equipped with an elevator. The infirmary and elementary school cafeteria are on the ground floor with the elementary classrooms, the teachers‚Äô lounge and the library on the first floor. The second floor houses the middle school classrooms, the photocopy room, the Art room and the Science labs. The secondary school classrooms and teachers‚Äô lounges, the technology lab and the dance hall are located on the third floor. The roof provides additional school-yard space for older students and a cafeteria, servicing secondary school students.

Biography A graduate the √âcole Camondo in Paris with a degree in interior architecture and design, Robert Couturier moved to New York in 1981. He quickly established his own practice, which has been recognized in, among other media, Architectural Digest‚Äôs prestigious annual list of the best decorators and architectural firms in the world. In June 2012, Elle Decor included Mr. Couturier in its A-list Top 60 Designers and British House & Garden named him one of the top 10 foreign decorators. In 1987 while still relatively inexperienced, Mr. Couturier was entrusted by the financier Sir James Goldsmith with what would amount to the single greatest private commission of modern times: the re-conception, execution, and continuous embellishment - down to the last gilded detail - of Goldsmith‚Äôs 20,000-acre kingdom on the Pacific Coast of Mexico. Crowned by a 60,000-square-foot vaulted-and-tile-domed hilltop palace called La Loma, the estate came to encompass vast satellite villas and assorted guest pavilions. He later completed the picture by decorating Goldsmith‚Äôs Boeing 757 (\\"a flying carpet with a motor\\"), his double-width Manhattan townhouse, and his historic French chateau. Two and a half decades later, the New York-based Couturier continues to execute grand-scale commissions in the U.S., Europe, South America, and Russia. Today his name has become synonymous with continental and international style and elegance working with clients such as Anne Hearst and Jay McInerney, Cecile David Weil, Fred Iseman, Frederic Fekkai and Vanity Fair special correspondent Amy Fine Collins. Couturier has contributed to major architecture and design books and, in October 2014, released his first monograph, Robert Couturier: Designing Paradises with Rizzoli New York, showcasing a beautiful range of multifaceted work, from Old World elegance to contemporary design. In his introduction Couturier admits, \\"I‚Äôm completely addicted to luxury. I have no ability for anything else.\\" He lectures widely at galleries and at arts and antique fairs, and participates in charitable and design-industry events. His work has been featured in publications such as Architectural Digest, Vogue, Vanity Fair, Town and Country, the New York Times, Cond√© Nast Traveler, House and Garden, The Robb Report, and Elle D√©cor and Wallstreet Journal. He currently lives in Connecticut with his partner, Jeffrey Morgan.

History The vicariate dates from 4 May 1846. The Capuchin Guglielmo Massaia of the Latin Church was the first vicar Apostolic. He was consecrated Bishop of Cassia, 24 May 1846, and sent on a mission to the Oromo tribes. Only after five years was he able to reach the region of Galla Assandabo, 20 November 1852. Having evangelized the districts of Goudrou, Lagamara, Limmou, Nonna, and Guera, Massaia entered the Kingdom of Kaffa on 4 October 1859, where conversions were abundant. He provided the converted tribes with priests, so that when persecution obliged him to flee, Christianity did not disappear. In 1868, Massaia was at Shewa, where he worked until 1879, and enjoyed the confidence of Menelik II of Ethiopia, who made him his confidential counsellor. In the interval the missions of Kaffa and Guera were administered by his coadjutor Bishop Felicissimo Coccino, who died 26 February 1878. In 1879 Negus John of Abyssinia compelled his vassal Menelik to order Bishop Massaia to return to Europe. The bishop had already been banished seven times, and handed over the government of the vicariate to his coadjutor Bishop Taurin Cahagne, from 14 February 1875 titular Bishop of Adramittium. The mission of Harar was founded by Bishop Taurin, who from 1880 to 1899 worked in this largely Muslim area. He wrote a catechism and works of Christian instruction in the Galla language. The vicariate included the three main districts of Shewa, Kaffa and Harar. For history from 1914 see Roman Catholic Diocese of Djibouti.

The dish is mostly eaten for breakfast or as a midday snack or sometimes as a one-dish meal, often as part of misal pav. It remains a favourite snack since it is easy to make with affordable ingredients and has a good nutritional value. The taste of misal ranges from mildly to extremely spicy. And there are a lot of varieties as well. Misal is also a popular street food. The dish is always served hot. The dish originates from the boundary of Khandesh and Western Maharashtra. Present day Nasik and Ahmednagar districts of Maharashtra.  Ingredients  The ingredients of misal vary widely, and consist of a combination of the following: * Usal, a curry made from matki (moth bean) or watane (dried pea) or even mung beans. * Tarri/kat/sample/rassa, a spicy gravy. This is the heart of the dish and is usually made in many variants identified by colour as \\"kala rassa\\" (black), \\"laal rassa\\"(red), \\"hirwa rassa\\"(green) etc., with the most famous one being tambda-pandhra rassa. The colour of the tarri is imparted by the ingredients used and not by artificial edible food colouring agents. So a green tarri would be made from green chilies and corriander whereas the black tarri would be made from dry roasted bay-leaf and black pepper as main ingredients. The red tarri as expected would have red-chilli powder. * Batata Bhaji (boiled, diced potatoes, spiced with turmeric, chilies, ginger & mustard). * Curd called dahi in Marathi (optional) * Chivda (jaad poha chivda) * Farsan (not required if Chivda is used) * Garnish of onions, tomatoes, coriander, lemon wedge * Pav (Slice or Laadi) Kolhapuri Misal Pav with taak (buttermilk). The ingredients are arranged in multiple tier fashion and served. * The first ingredient to be served is matki or moth bean usal. Usal is sprouted beans cooked with tomatoes and onions. The nutritional value comes from the sprouted beans. * The second layer is Batata bhaaji spread thin over the usal * The third layer is Chivda also spread thin over the Batata Bhaaji. * The fourth layer is a mixture of Onions, tomatoes, coriander and thin Sev. * Tarri or Kat is added to fill up the bowl (more Tarri is served in a separate bowl) * Misal is served with sliced bread or a small loaf, in the dish misal-pav.  Variants  * There is a variant called \\"upwaas misal\\" which can also be eaten in case a person is on a religious fast, typically ganesh chaturthi. It contains food items made from potato, sabudana, peanuts etc. * Mamledar Misal is in Thane City and is usually more spicy. * Puneri Misal is another version which contains pohe. * Katakirr, Masti Misal, Chulivarchi Misal, Bedekar, Shri Krishna and Shree Upahar Gruh are amongst the more popular restaurants serving Misal in Pune * The Kolhapuri version of misal is usually spicy and does not contain pohe and is served with thick slices of bread, not pav. Phadtare misal is famous in Kolhapur. * In the Nasik region, misal is mostly served with a fried papad. * Dahi misal is also one of the widely eaten forms, where curd is added to balance the spicy taste. * Jain misal is another new variant in the misal industry, which does not contain any onion or garlic. Even the matki used is not sprouted, but just soaked. 'masti misal' in Pune is famous for its Jain misal.

In 1943, the Salon de Mai was founded as an Association (declared in 1944) in opposition to Nazi ideology and its condemnation of degenerate art. It founder members were the art critic Gaston Diehl and the painters, sculptors and engravers Henri-Georges Adam, Emmanuel Auricoste, Lucien Coutaud, Robert Couturier, Jacques Despierre (who suggested naming the salon after the month in which its first meetings were held), Marcel Gili, L√©on Gischia, Francis Gruber, Jean Le Moal, Alfred Manessier, Andr√© Marchand, Edouard Pignon, Gustave Singier, Claude Venard and Roger Vieillard, who together formed it direction committee. Several of them (Coutaud, Gischia, Le Moal, Manessier, Marchand, ORAZI, Pignon, Singier) participated in the 1941 exhibition . Under its president Gaston Diehl the first Salon de Mai exhibition took place in the art galerie \\"Pierre Maurs\\" (3, avenue Matignon) from 29 May to 29 June 1945. Its honorary committee was made up of Germain Bazin, Jacques Dupont, Ren√© Huyghe, Bernard Dorival, Michel Florisoone, Pierre Ladou√© and Marc Thiboutet. Its judging panel was headed by Jean Follain. The catalogue of this first Salon had a preface by Gaston Diehl, with texts by Ren√© Bertel√© and Andr√© Rolland de Ren√©ville, poems by Jacques Pr√©vert, Lucien Becker, Andr√© Fr√©naud, Jean Follain and Guillevic. Even after the liberation of Paris, and subsequently of France, logistical problems in the city remained serious and the lack of public spaces was a limitation. Consequently, in 1946 the Salon de Mai was organized on the fourth floor of the famous department store \\"Galeries Lafayettes\\", in 1947 it was held at the art gallery \\"Arts\\" (140, Faubourg Saint-Honor√©), in 1948 at the art gallery Lambert-Marie (22, Place Vend√¥me). Only in 1949 the Salon de Mai was organized in the large rooms of the \\"Palais de New-York\\" (Avenue du Pr√©sident Wilson), which then hosted it until 1954. In the following years, until 1968, it was held at the \\"Mus√©e d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris\\". From 1969 onwards, the Salon de Mai had to deal with major logistical problems, so its exhibition often changed address. The 64th and last Salon de Mai took place from 6 to 11 May 2014 at the \\"Espace Commines\\" (17, rue Commines).

The ship was a project of the Plymouth Company, branch of the proprietary Virginia Company, on land England claimed as belonging to the Virginia Colony. She was the first English-built ship in what is now Maine and possibly in all of the English-colonized areas of North America, and a demonstration of the new colony's ability to build ships. The second and third \\"local\\" pinnaces (Deliverance and Patience) were built soon afterwards in Bermuda following the loss of Sea Venture during the Third Supply. Virginia was built at the mouth of the Kennebec River in what is now Phippsburg, Maine. Little is known about the details of her architecture, but written accounts of the colony and historical records of similar ships suggest that Virginia was a pinnace that displaced about 30 tons and measured somewhat less than long, with a beam of . She had a flush main deck, drew about fully loaded, and had a freeboard of less than .  Background  The Popham Colony, also known as the Sagadahoc Colony, was established in 1607 by the Plymouth Company. It was situated near the present town of Phippsburg, Maine near the mouth of the Sagadahoc River, now the Kennebec River. The expedition's mission was to find gold, the Northwest Passage, a river passage to China, to fish and hunt Beaver for fur and to sell and prove that New World forests could build English ships. During the 12 months the colony existed, the colonists completed one major project: the construction of a 30-ton ship, a pinnace, they called Virginia. It was the first known ship to be built in what would later become the United States of America by Europeans, and the first ship of noteworthy size for which solid evidence exists that she was constructed there. It was also meant to show that the colony could be used for shipbuilding. The choice to build a 'small' pinnace for the Popham Colony was a good one. Able to support at least three different rigs, the 'small' pinnace was very versatile and could be assigned to offshore fishing, the North Atlantic fishing grounds, or readied for a trans-Atlantic journey to England with equal ease.‚ÄúBuilding a Replica of the Virginia.‚Äù Retrieved December 8, 2010. Fred M. Walker and Associates of Tenterdon produced concept drawings, David B. Wyman, Naval Architect developed the working design with important input from Captain Steve Cobb, Shipwright Rob Stevens and Maine's First Ship Historian, John Bradford. Plans were finalized and the Maine's First Ship Project was formed at Bath, Maine in 2007. At this time the term \\"pinnace\\" could mean either a larger full rigged pinnace, or a smaller ship that could be stowed (or towed) and used a ship's tender. Virginia was a pinnace of the smaller type, although perhaps similar to a shallop. Shallops are mentioned as often as the pinnace in earliest records of water craft in the European colonies in North America but is rarely described as a 'ship'. The largest shallops might approach the smallest 'small' pinnaces in size, but average size was much smaller and places the shallop within the category 'boat'.  Design  Virginia would have been about 56 feet long with a beam of 15 feet 5 inches, a flush main deck that drew approximately 6 feet 5 inches fully loaded, a freeboard of less than 2 feet, and weight of approximately 30 tons. Sketches of the replica's hull design and framing are online at the Maine First Ship website.Virginia Drawing Slide Show, n.d. Retrieved December 7, 2010. For ocean voyages, Virginia would likely have been rigged with a square- rigged main mast, a much smaller second mast that was gaff rigged, and a small square sail under the bowsprit. The main mast on many pinnaces would have been large enough to carry a small topsail. Plans for Virginia that include a plausible rigging are available from the Maine Maritime Museum.Catalog of Plans of Historic Boats and Ships at the Maine Maritime Museum, Bath ME, 2008. Retrieved September 1, 2008. For coastal work, Virginia would have used a fore-and-aft rig with a sprit mainsail and one headsail.Sailing Ship Rigs, nd. Retrieved January 26, 2011 How the coastal rigging would have been changed for a cross-Atlantic voyage is not yet fully understood. In John Walker's drawing of Virginia when rigged for a trans Atlantic voyage, an aft-rigged mizzen mast carries a sail that resembles a lateen sail more closely than a spanker. This variety of rigs enabled the 'small' pinnaces of this era for several different assignments. They could be used as fishing boats, storage at anchor, tender to large ships or supply ships that were often towed to their destination by a larger ship.

The ship's first major role came on October 17, 1608, as the Popham Colony was abandoned when Captain James Davis and 45 colonists packed into Virginia to return to England.According to Charles M. Andrews (The Colonial Period of American History, Yale University Press, 1934, I, 92) confirms the return of Virginia to England with Popham colonists, after which she would return to the service of the Virginia Company. John H. Morrison (History of the New York Ship Yards, New York, 1909) corroborates the above and indicates that colonists sailed in her to the colony at Jamestown in 1608.Captain James Davis, 1580-1623: The Early Settlement of New England & Virginia . retrieved September 2, 2008..History of Popham Colony, Retrieved December 18, 2010. Evidence of the Popham Colony remained buried until discovered by Dr. Jeffrey Bain in 1997. Structurally sound after her first ocean crossing, Virginia had more work to do. On May 23, 1609, a new Charter of the Virginia Company, drafted by Francis Bacon, was signed by King James I of England. This Charter granted a vast extension of territory and expanded powers to the Company, spurring a renewed effort to save the remaining colony at Jamestown. Virginia was one of two pinnaces and seven larger ships in the fleet known as the Third Supply. With 500-600 people, the supply mission left Falmouth, Cornwall, England on June 8, 1609, directly for the colony in Virginia by way of the Azores and Bermuda. Virginia and one other pinnace were towed by the 300 ton purpose-built flagship, Sea Venture, which was the first single-timbered merchantman built in England, and also the first dedicated emigration ship. The fleet encountered a powerful three-day hurricane near BermudaWash & NoVa Company - Biographies - James Davis resulting in the loss of two ships, Catch and Sea Venture. Meanwhile, Davis guided Virginia safely to Jamestown, arriving on October 3, 1609. This arrival was six weeks later than the other ships that had not been 'captured' by the Bermuda hurricane of late July, 1609. The long travel time suggests that Virginia may once again have been in tow behind a larger ship, or significantly blown off course, or damaged.Captain James Davis, 1580-1623, The Early Settlement of New England & Virginia by Kerry S. Davis, 2009. Retrieved September 2, 2009. John Smith's refusal to resign the governorship had promoted political divisiveness, and the arrival of the battered fleet's limited supplies and extra mouths was not greeted with enthusiasm. Nonetheless, Davis became the Commander of the Fort Algernon at Point Comfort. Virginia become a safe refuge when Indian hostilities erupted. She was also used to go inland to relieve Fort Algernon and attempt trade with the Powhatan confederacy. During this trip, Davis decapitated two Indians and left their mutilated bodies near the fort. On yet another inland foray, he destroyed a Powhatan village, burnt their corn and killed all men, women and children. Davis was soon in command of three forts. Afterward, Virginia and Davis returned safely to England. The last known details of Virginia were in 1610 when she once again delivered settlers and supplies to the Jamestown Colony under the command of Tomas West. After the return to Jamestown in mid-June, Captain Robert Tyndall was directed to take Virginia to catch fish in the Chesapeake Bay between Cape Henry and Cape Charles. There is no mention of Virginia afterward in known historical records.1606/1607 Voyage To Virginia., Retrieved on Sept.22, 2008 Replica The pinnace Virginia is being reconstructed by an all volunteer group Maine' First Ship just upriver from the site it was originally built.

Before dikes were built, the river was a major source of spring flooding in the Creston valley. Course in length, the Goat River rises in the central Purcell Mountains just west of Mallaindane Pass and flows largely south until meeting Kitchener Creek. From this confluence, it bends southwest towards the towns of Erickson and Creston. Its lower reaches are the route of the southern mainline of the Canadian Pacific Railway and the Crowsnest Highway.

History In the 1860s, the lower Goat River valley became part of the route for the Dewdney Trail, connecting the gold fields of Wild Horse Creek with the coast. Surveyed and constructed by Edgar Dewdney and Walter Moberly, the trail was seen as a countermeasure to American encroachment into the southern Kootenays. The demand for electricity in the growing town of Creston led to the construction of the Goat River Dam in the early 1930s. The concrete arch dam is located five kilometers east of Creston. It operated until the large power projects of the 1950s in the Kootenays reduced the need for the generating station, which suffered from ice buildup in winter and an inconstant water supply.

Life St. Edmund's College, Old Hall Griffiths was born in London, and was the first and only Vicar Apostolic of the London District educated wholly in England. At the age of thirteen he was sent to St. Edmund's College, Old Hall, where he went through the whole course, and was ordained priest in 1814. Four years later he was chosen as president, at the age of 27. He ruled the college for fifteen years, and did much to give the college a sound financial basis. Vicar Apostolic He was then appointed coadjutor to Bishop Bramston, then Vicar Apostolic of the London District. He was consecrated as Titular Bishop of Olena at St. Edmund's College, 28 October 1833. Within three years Bishop Bramston died, and Bishop Griffiths succeeded him.Ward, Bernard. \\"Thomas Griffiths.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 7. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 11 January 2019 A biographical sketch by one of his priests describes Griffiths as \\"...silent, meditative, bland, inoffensive, ever too happy to serve and oblige everyone; patient, enduring, forgiving; unmoved by slights, unkindness, or even insults -a man after God's own heart, full of faith, of hope, of love; not one thing today and another tomorrow, but ever consistent and the same.\\"Father Thomas of St. George's, Southwark. \\"Saint George's and the Late Bishop Griffiths\\", The New Catholic Weekly Magazine, August 28, 1847, p. 266 The agitation for a regular Catholic hierarchy in England became more and more pronounced and as a preliminary measure, in 1840, the four ecclesiastical \\"districts\\" into which England had been divided since the reign of James II of England were subdivided to form eight, Dr. Griffiths retaining the new London District. Soon after this, the Oxford movement and attendant Catholic conversions began: and the immigration of Irish Catholics grew. At the same time the growth of the British colonies, many of which had been until lately ruled as part of the London District, brought him into contact with the government. In all these spheres Griffiths discharged his duties with practical ability; but it was thought that he would not have the breadth of view or experience necessary for initiating the new hierarchy, and (according to Bishop Ullathorne) this was the reason why its establishment was postponed. When Griffiths died, somewhat unexpectedly, in 1847 Ullathorne himself preached the funeral sermon. The body of the deceased prelate was laid temporarily in the vaults of Moorfields Church; but two years later it was removed to St. Edmund's College, where a new chapel by Augustus Pugin was in course of erection, and a special chantry was built to receive the body of Griffiths, to whose initiative the chapel was due. An oil painting of Griffiths is at Archbishop's House, Westminster; another, more modern, at St. Edmund's College.

The name Cayoosh Creek remains on the bridge-sign crossing the stream on BC Highway 99 and continues in use locally to refer to the final reaches of the Seton River, formerly Seton Creek,Tales from Seton Portage, Irene Edwards, self-publ., Lillooet 1976 which prior to the renaming ending at the confluence with Cayoosh Creek. The creek is the namesake of Cayoosh Creek Indian Reserve No. 1,BC Names/GeoBC entry \\"Cayoosh Creek 1 (Indian reserve)\\" one of the main Indian reserves of the Cayoose Creek Indian Band (aka the Sekwelwas First Nation), which lies adjacent to what was renamed the Seton River without local consultation. Course Cayoosh Creek flows generally northeast from sources in the eponymous Cayoosh Range north of Cayoosh Pass to join the Seton River at Lillooet, British Columbia. In local parlance, the 4 kilometre length of the Seton River to its confluence with the Fraser River at the town of Lillooet is referred to as Cayoosh Creek, as is indicated by a Department of Highways sign on the BC Highway 99 bridge crossing it just before the Bridge of the Twenty-Three Camels over the Fraser, which lies immediately upstream of the river's mouth. Cayoosh Canyon Although already 10 km long when it enters Duffey Lake, a long lake which is the focus of its upper basin, at the lake's outflow it begins a rapid descent, carving deeply between the Cayoosh Range and the main Lillooet Ranges to the south. Duffey Lake is named for \\"Sapper Duffy\\", a Lieut. Patrick Duffey (or \\"Duffy\\") or the Royal Engineers, who was assigned to investigate the route of the Cayoosh valley as a possible wagon road from the head of Lillooet Lake to Lillooet, which because of the steep descent westwards from Cayoosh Pass was not gone forward with. The creek's final descent to the confluence with the Seton is a deeper and deeper canyon, narrow and twisting, with the last ridges of the Cayoosh Range forming a rock wall thousands of feet in height, immediately opposite the highway across a very narrow gorge below. The north wall of the canyon was the location of the Golden Cache Mine,BC MINFILE Record Summary No. 092HNW048, GOLDEN CACHE, GEM GROUP which started a small regional rush in 1897-1901 and whose former mill buildings were in the depths of the canyon below the highway and whose workings were reached by ramparts beneath overhangs on the highest part of the canyon wall. Opposite it was the Ample Mine, also a gold mine in the same period.BC MINFILE Record Summary No. 092JNE069, AMPLE (L.335), BEV, GEM (L.525), GOLDMAX, AMPLE GOLDMAX, ARTHUR NOEL, GOLDEN CACHE, COUGAR, AMPLE-GOLDMAX This stretch of the canyon was the site of the hunt for First World War hero-turned-outlaw Frank Gott, who is commemorated by Gott Peak which is on the southern rim of the Cayoosh basin, on the divide separating it from the basin of the Stein River, which parallels it roughly to the south, and which is which is one of Cayoosh Creek's several large southern tributaries. At the bottom of the canyon, as the highway clings to a mountainface some three thousand feet high, ranging from one to two thousand feet to the creek, steep below, there is a small private reservoir formed by a dam where Cayoosh Falls had once been known as Walden North. Walden North was a private estate and scientific research facility and manufacturing installation built by American uranium prospector Vernon Pick. From Cayoosh Falls to the Fraser was the scene of the Cayoosh Gold Rush of the 1880s, in which 300 Chinese gold miners were estimated by the local Government Agent to have taken out around $6 million in gold. The creek's riverbed throughout this stretch was literally turned upside down and remains of Chinese gold-mills and gold-furnaces can be found near the Hydro campsite, as well as piles of washed rocks which are byproducts of Chinese mining methods. \\"Nkoomptch\\" Towering over the lower reaches of the canyon and Walden North as a large BC Hydro-run campground on the creek's final bottomlands near the Seton River, is Mount Brew. Brew is the highest in the northern Lillooet Ranges at 9970'; the elevation of the confluence is about 700', the edge of Brew's summit above, less than a mile to the south, is around 8800'. A buttress of Mount Brew lies to the southeast of the confluence, even closer and overhanging the lower Seton River, and features an 8000' near-sheer wall, while on the north across the Seton River are the last ramparts of Mission Ridge, reaching up to 6000' in this area, which is also the terminus of the Cayoosh Range. The combined gorge-walls of Seton Lake, the Cayoosh Range, Cayoosh Canyon, Mount Brew and its northward buttress, and the last buttress of Mission Ridge, form a large canyon complex ranging from 5000' to 7000' which also is a zone of extreme aridity and high summer temperatures, featuring lizards, cactus, and sagebrush. \\"Nkoomptch\\" is the historical name for this locality historically and means \\"water crossing over\\" in the St'at'imcets language. In this locality, Governor Seymour commissioned one of the Interior's three first flour mills in 1862, the others being at Big Bar 60 km up the Fraser, in times when the Lillooet District produced mostly grain, as a measure to secure food supplies for the Cariboo Gold Rush. A store was also located in this area, operated by Dan Hurley, a Lillooet rancher and hotelier, as this was the route of the wagon road from the foot of Seton Lake, the last water leg of the Douglas Road, into Lillooet.Halfway to the Goldfields: A History of Lillooet, Lorraine Edwards, Sunfire Press, 1972 Cayoosh Creek's last reaches are unusual in that they are bridged by a canal, the Seton Canal, which is part of the last phase of the Bridge River Power Project and feeds a powerhouse on the Fraser just south of the Seton River's confluence. Name There are differing accounts over how the stream acquired its name. \\"Cayoosh\\" is the local form of \\"cayuse\\", and in the Lillooet and Chilcotin regions refers to a particular strain of Indian mountain pony The traditional indigenous name of the stream is said to be Tsammuk and/or Tsho- ha-mous.

The policy was suggested in a period of great anxiety in the US as Cold War tensions were heightened following the Korean War (1950‚Äì53) and the 1949 communist takeover in the Republic of China after the Chinese Civil War. These tensions put great pressure on President Truman to adopt this policy, but ultimately he rejected it fearing that it would pin the USA down in the Far East dealing with a 'secondary enemy' - the People's Republic of China - whilst his real concern, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, would have a free hand in Europe. Truman did however make some attempts to strengthen the American position in the Far East, but not at the expense of Europe. In 1950, the US promised military assistance to the French in the struggle against the Viet Minh in the First Indochina War. In 1951, the United States signed a peace treaty with Japan allowing US troops to remain stationed at Okinawa and tying Japan to the US. Also in the period 1950‚Äì51, US reinforcements were sent to South Korea to strengthen the US military position there. In this period the US navy was also steamed into the Formosa Strait as a deterrent to prevent conflict between the Chinese nationalists who had escaped to the island of Formosa (Taiwan) and the Chinese communists in mainland China.H.

He was also involved in cement manufacture. He was briefly a pioneer in prefab housing but that industry was destined to use timber, not concrete plates.  Early life  Stone was born on in Sydney,NSW BDM Index: 764/1876 the son of John Jasper Stone, Civil Engineer, and Caroline Smith. He served a 'cadetship' with his father, then worked for the Roads and Bridges Branch of the Public Works Department for about seven years, after which he joined the Sewerage Construction Department. Three years later, in 1900, he joined the newly formed Sydney Harbour Trust as Chief Design Engineer. In 1907 he entered private practice as 'Consulting Engineer and Structural Architect, specialising in Reinforced Concrete'.

Alsop In 1909 Stone applied for a patent for 'improvements relating to storage chambers' such as silos, using precast concrete plates with integral edge beams, these edges being formed with flanges and gussets to assist in their assembly. Stone set up a precasting plant in Emu Plains NSW, for the manufacture of reinforced concrete houses, silos, water troughs, bins and other products. The system he developed was used for the construction of a five-roomed cottage (heritage listed but since then demolished) at 2 Railway Street, Emu Plains and for a large house of two storeys in Iandra (7 Windermere Avenue, Northmead) for George Henry Greene,Australian Dictionary of Biography: \\"Greene, George Henry (1838‚Äì1911)\\" member of the Legislative Council of New South Wales (listed on the Baulkham Hills LEP). Stone also built other houses and silos. On Greene's property, he also built a stable and a motor garage, a large silo surmounted by a water tank, and single-storey bachelor's quarters, completed in 1910 and known locally as Iandra Castle.  Stone and Siddeley  In 1912 Stone entered a partnership with Ernest J. Siddeley, in which Stone was the driving design force while Siddeley was the project manager who executed the works. Edward Giles Stone adopted the Consid√®re system for reinforcing concrete and the partnership produced some remarkable buildings and structures using this system, notably the Dennys Lascelles Austin wool store at Geelong, the Barwon Sewerage Aqueduct, Floating Pontoons at Circular Quay and the Breakwater at Glenelg.See also the article in the Commonwealth Engineer Stone and his partner Siddeley designed and constructed the concrete structures on the Mortlake Gas Works in Sydney including the coal and coke bunkers, the tunnel to take the Telpher system under the retorts, as well as the Power House. Stone is seen as an important early user of reinforced concrete of interest due to his use of the Consid√®re system. Elements of the Consid√®re system, notably the helical wrapping later became accepted reinforcing practice but at the time of Stone was working, the approach was novel. Lewis considers \\"the most innovative form of reinforcement used in Australia was that of the Frenchman Armand-Gabriel Consid√®re.\\" The Consid√®re system worked on the basic principle of the reinforcement of compression members with heavy spiral reinforcing bars, much heavier than would be necessary for a simple ligature. Consid√®re's compression members were usually circular or polygonal in section, and he introduced spiral winding in other zones of compression, such as the haunches of beams, where they were angled up on the slope. The development of reinforced concrete and its application in Australia has been discussed by various authors.Fraser, D. J. 1985. Early Reinforced Concrete in New South Wales (1895‚Äì1915). Multi-Disciplinary Engineering Transactions of the Institution of Engineers, Australia IX:82‚Äì91 Lewis, M. B. Editor. 1988. Two hundred years of concrete in Australia. North Sydney: Concrete Institute of Australia. Of the various patented systems, the Monier system was implemented in NSW by Carter, Gummow & Co from 1895 followed by its implementation in Victoria by Monash and Anderson from 1905 (see Sir John Monash. Miles Lewis has noted \\"The reason why few engineers were active is that the technology was riddled with patents, and that the Monier company in particular tried to give the impression that they had the sole rights to reinforced concrete.Lewis, M. B. pers. com. March 2004 However, Stone was not merely important because of his application of a reinforcing system in Australia, from some of his known works Stone was an innovative and daring designer of concrete structures. The partnership of Stone and Siddeley was an important rival to the practice of Monash and Anderson. Opinions seem to vary as to the cause of the practice's demise. The breakwater at Glenelg was never completed and there was a dispute with the South Australian government. Stone had some unfortunate associations with cement production in Tasmania (possibly at the Goliath works) and at Port Kembla.  Early Designs in Reinforced Concrete  It is interesting, when comparing Edward Giles Stone's work with that of his contemporaries such as John Monash and others, that Stone combined the innovation of reinforced concrete with some spectacular designs of which the Dennys Lascelles Austin wool store, and the Barwon Sewer Auqeduct, seem to have been the most prominent. The status of these two works attests to Stone's prominence as an innovative designer of reinforced concrete structures being at the time (early 20th century) one of the leading designers in the world working in reinforced concrete (but probably he wasn't known outside Australia). Edward Giles Stone's legacy can be seen through the heritage listing of two of his greatest works. The Barwon Sewer Aqueduct The aqueduct was built between 1913 and 1915. It is a reinforced concrete truss structure, in a form derived from the Firth of Forth rail bridge in Scotland, with a typical span of 53.7m and an overall length of 756m. Both the maximum span and the overall length are far in excess of any other Australian reinforced concrete structure of the time). The truss form is most unusual in concrete, very few being built anywhere in the world. The structure is significant at the National level as an early, unique and innovative use of reinforced concrete. The structure which has remarkable aesthetic and technical qualities is dramatically situated in the landscape of the Barwon River floodplain near Breakwater, Geelong. The site is included on the Victorian Heritage Register (VHR Number: H0895) Victorian Heritage Register, VHR Number: H0895 \\"Ovoid Sewer Aqueduct over Barwon River\\" and the Register of National Estate (RNE 16061) See also the non-statutory National Trust of Australia (Victoria) Register (B5779)National Trust Register: B5779 \\"Ovoid Sewer Aqueduct\\" (Preceeding text based on the entry in the Australian Heritage Places inventory) In 2004, the Aqueduct was nominated to the National Heritage List. Following assessment by the Australian Heritage Council the nomination was not adopted by the Minister. Barwon Water has applied to Heritage Victoria for a permit to remove four of the 14 spans of the heritage-listed Ovoid Sewer Aqueduct, as these had been rapidly deteriorating in condition since the 1970s ( www.heritage.vic.gov.au/permits/currently-advertised-permits ). In considering the Aqueduct's future, Barwon Water has investigated options for ensuring public safety and improving public access to the Barwon River and the surrounding land; as well as attempting to balance heritage values with the management of costs for customers\\". The former Dennys Lascelles Austin Concrete Woolstore This was a series of buildings in Geelong built in stages from 1872. The final major extension to the buildings was the so-called Bow String Truss building, which was started in 1910. The architect and engineer was Edward Giles Stone. The builder of the concrete woolstore was J C Taylor and Sons although much of the construction was by day labour. The building was a very early and innovative use of reinforced concrete. Of particular note are the daringly large trusses on the top floor, which provided a clear space of 55m x 52m, an important consideration for the Dennys' style of selling wool at the place of storage and display. Not only was this by a very big margin the largest reinforced concrete roof span in the world, but also it was assembled with enormous ingenuity. The great span was achieved by adopting the principles of bridge design, and in fact copying the form of a major bridge at Plougastel in Brittany designed by Consid√®re in his position at the Ponts et Chauss√©es. The trusses were, in fact, paired with the sawtooth roof passing through them. They followed the Consid√®re patent in form and method of reinforcing. The precast panels of the roof were also notable. (Their 1915 US Patent Application \\"Process of molding plastics\\" provides an insight into how they achieved such high quality precast panels.) The site is registered on the Victorian Heritage Register (VHR Number: H0587) Victorian Heritage Register, VHR Number: H0587 \\"Bow Truss Building (Demolished)\\" and was included on the Register of The National Estate (RNE 19070). See also the non-statutory National Trust of Australia (Victoria) Register (B4710)National Trust Register: B4710 \\"Dennys Lascelles Concrete Woolstore (Bow Truss)\\" The building was nominated for world heritage listing due to its exceptional characteristics relating to the pioneering use of reinforced concrete. The world heritage nomination had been supported by international referees who had assessed the application. Unfortunately this building was demolished, in controversial circumstances, in 1990. (This text based on the entry in the Australian Heritage Places inventory ) The 1917 Coastal Traders Proposal \\"The Argus\\" of Friday 8 June 1917 p6\\"Shipbuilding, Concrete Vessels\\", The Argus, Friday 8 June 1917 p6 reports a proposal of Stone's to construct a fleet of concrete ships. The paper reported \\"Mr. E. G. Stone, of Messrs. Stone and Siddeley, engineers and contractors, has put before the Prime Minister a proposal to construct a 4,000 ton concrete vessel within seven months, and after that, if the work is organised on a large enough scale, to maintain an output of one similar vessel a week\\" \\"The vessels would be built of concrete, with a framework of steel bars, which can easily be obtained. Messrs. Thompson Brothers, of Castlemaine, and other engineering firms have offered to supply the necessary engines within the specified time. They will be internal combustion engines, of the semi- Diesel type, and the vessels will be capable of a speed of 10 knots an hour. A greater speed could be attained, but it would not justify the expense. The vessels will be purely cargo-carriers, of course. My firm has offered to back my opinion that the vessels will be seaworthy and satisfactory, by a guarantee of ¬£10,000, and Messrs Thompson Brothers will back their engines\\" There is no evidence that any of these proposed vessels were constructed. Stone and Tasmanian Cement Stone was one of the founders of Tasmanian Cement Pty Ltd in 1922. The initial plant was to be near Hobart but Stone became interested in the Railton site because of nearby oil shale. He formulated an invention to use the exhaust gases from the cement kiln to distil oil from the oil shale. Erection of plant began in late 1923 or early 1924. Stone was the managing director but without salary. He received shares for his part in founding the company and assignment of his inventions and patents. The company was short of money in 1924 and persuaded Dorman, Long & Company (who had secured the contract to build the Sydney Harbour Bridge to take up shares in the venture. In 1925 the company was still short of money and the president (Sir Hugh Bell) of Dorman, Long visited Tasmania and Dorman, Long again agreed to put in money but on condition they took over management. Stone was asked to resign as managing director. The board (including L Ennis of Dorman, Long) then decided to sack Stone as construction engineer. It was evident that Stone's oil shale plant did not work. The cement plant was changed from oil firing to pulverised coal firing. The first cement was produced in 1926 and supplied to Hume Pipe Company of Melbourne. The company was reformed in July 1928 as Goliath Portland Cement with 5 directors including one from Dorman, Long (L Ennis) and one from Hume Pipe Company (T S Nettlefold). The company still operates today. Because of the problems with Stone's technology and Tasmanian Cement Pty. Ltd, Dorman, Long had to buy their cement from Kandos for the harbour bridge.Mckay, P. 1977, History of the Cement Industry to 1939 ‚Äì An Essay, July 1977 Cement and Concrete Association of Australia. Another cement works associated with E.G. Stone is believed to have been the \\"Never Been Beaten Lime & Cement Works\\" at Deep Creek, Narrabeen on the Northern Beaches of Sydney which may have operated c1941-1955. Further research into these works is ongoing.

Adapting their name from New York theatre La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club, they released three singles and two albums and worked as backing singers on a number of recordings for other artists. History The original members Madeleine Davis, Patricia Shockley and Kathy Bartney, all hailing from the United States of America, had settled in Germany in the late 1970s where they had done various session work. While singing backing vocals on ex-Silver Convention singer Ramona Wulf's album Shake What Yo Mama Give Ya, they were introduced to producer Frank Farian by guitarist Mats Bj√∂rklund. He hired them for backing Precious Wilson on her debut album On the Race Track (1980) - at this time they had not yet adapted the collective name La Mama. Impressed with their harmonies, Farian also used La Mama to demo new songs for Boney M. - even doing one Boney M. recording, \\"Gadda-Da-Vida\\" with La Mama and himself doing all the vocals. Also several tracks on Boney M.'s 1981 album Boonoonoonoos (\\"Silly Confusion\\" in particular, \\"Don't Kill the World\\" and \\"Malaika\\") featured La Mama's uncredited backing vocals. First single \\"Elephant Funk\\" / \\"In and Out\\" (1982) l-r: Kathy Bartney, Madeleine Davis, Patricia Shockley While production on Precious Wilson's second album began late 1981, La Mama also commenced work on their first album, produced by Dietmar Kawohl and Mats Bj√∂rklund. The Double A-side single \\"Elephant Funk\\" / \\"In and Out\\" was released in February 1982 (\\"In and Out\\" being the A-side on the 12\\" single) followed by a cover version of \\"Chanson D'Amour\\" a few months later. Neither single performed well commercially and the LP release was postponed. While Madeleine Davis had contributed lyrics for Precious Wilson's single \\"I Don't Know\\", the group also did backing vocals on Boney M.'s \\"Going Back West\\". When their third single was released in December 1982, a cover of Labelle's \\"Voulez-Vous Coucher Avec Moi (Lady Marmelade)\\", lead singer Kathy Bartney had left the group after disagreements with Frank Farian, and when the group's LP Voulez-Vous Coucher Avec La Mama was released in January 1983, it sank without much notice. Meanwhile Farian started to use the vocals of singer Judy Cheeks - who had been signed to Ariola Records between 1977 and 1980. It must however be noticed that Judy Cheeks wasn't a member of La Mama. Farian just used her vocals on various projects together with Madeleine Davis and Patricia Shockley. Farian had Madeleine Davis and Patricia Shockley of La Mama together with Judy Cheeks record a medley of contemporary hits for an Aerobics album Aerobic Fitness Dancing with instructions by Sydne Rome - the album topped the German charts early 1983 and had Farian remix the album without Sydne Rome's vocals for an unsuccessful album project MAD - For Dancin' in the summer of 1983. 1983 album \\"Voulez-Vous Coucher Avec La Mama\\" Also during 1983, La Mama once again contributed uncredited backing vocals to Boney M.'s seventh album Ten Thousand Lightyears on the tracks \\"I Feel Good\\", \\"Barbarella Fortuneteller\\" and \\"The Alibama\\". By the end of the year, Precious Wilson's final album for Hansa, Funky Fingers - a medley-album of popular R&B;, soul and disco classics - was released. The first edition of the album credited just Precious Wilson while the second edition credited Precious Wilson & La Mama. Lacking any promotion by the record company, the album was unsuccessful and quickly disappeared. During 1984, La Mama backed Boney M. on the single \\"Happy Song\\" and participated as a part of Frank Farian Corporation on the benefit single \\"Mother and Child Reunion\\" early 1985. At this time ex-Silver Convention member Rhonda Heath stepped in for session work on Boney M.'s final album Eye Dance on which Madeleine Davis and Patricia Shockley of La Mama also took part. They sang the choruses on the tracks \\"Todos Buenos\\" and \\"Give It Up\\". Before the group finally split, Patricia Shockley and Rhonda Heath furthermore sang additional backing vocals on Far Corporation's hit single, a cover version of Led Zeppelin's \\"Stairway to Heaven\\". In 1989, Madeleine Davis received a phone call by Boney M. member Maizie Williams who invited her to take the place of original lead singer Liz Mitchell who had just left the group. Davis appeared in the group's official video of \\"The Summer Mega Mix\\", toured extensively with the group and also sang on their 1989 single \\"Everybody Wants to Dance Like Josephine Baker\\", not produced nor approved by Farian and subsequently withdrawn. Madeleine Davis now lives in Georgia, US, and works as a jazz singer.

On October 25 1899, the railway began permanent passenger and freight services. The Jokioinen Railway was the second privately owned narrow gauge railway opened for common carrier services in Finland. The railway ran from the Finnish State Railways Humppila station via Jokioinen to Forssa. The main- line length of the gauge railway was . In Forssa an electric railway of Forssa Oy connected with the Jokioinen Railway. Motive power The original motive power of the Jokioinen Railway was two American tank steam locomotives (Nos. 1 and 2) which were built in 1897 by H. K. Porter in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania. These locomotives were in operation for over 50 years until 1948. In 1900, the Railway bought another American steam locomotive from the Baldwin Locomotive Works, and it was given number 3. This locomotive was soon found to be too heavy for the light 17 kg/m rails of the railway, and it was sold to Estonia. In 1922 the railway purchased a small tank locomotive made by Lokomo in Tampere, Finland; in 1937 it bought a large tank locomotive made by Henschel in Kassel, Germany. This locomotive had to be given to the Soviet Union as a penalty fee for late war reparation payments in 1945. To replace the Henschel lost to the Soviet Union, the railway ordered two new locomotives from S. A. Les Ateliers M√©tallurgiques Nivelles Division de Tubize in Belgium. These locomotives were delivered in 1947 and 1948 and given numbers 4 and 5. During the 1950s and 1960s, the last years of the railway, trains were powered by a roster of four diesel locomotives. These locomotives were Move 21 models, manufactured by Valmet Airplane factory in Tampere, Finland. Originally, this type of locomotive was meant as a war payment to Soviet Union. Passenger traffic Beginning in the 1930s, all passenger traffic on the Jokioinen Railway was carried in railcars. Two railcars ran on the Jokioinen Railway. The first railcar ran from 1930 to 1932 and the second ran from 1932 to 1942. The railway had three passenger coaches. These coaches were built by Hietalahti Shipyard in Helsinki on top of frames and trucks manufactured by Leeds Forge Company in England. Freight traffic The Jokioinen Railway had a total of about one hundred freight cars. Most of these were manufactured at the end of the 1800s in England and Finland and were in use throughout the time the railway operated, from 1898 to 1974. In 1960 more freight cars were bought from the Loviisa‚ÄìVesij√§rvi railway when it was re-gauged to broad gauge Freight traffic was the principal traffic on the railway from the very beginning until its closure. Originally the railway was built to serve the needs of the expanding industries in Jokioinen and Forssa. The best year for freight traffic was 1940, during the short peace between the Winter War and the Continuation War, when a total of 90,000 tons of freight was carried on the Railway. The top year for passenger traffic was just after the Wars in 1945, when an annual total of 402,254 passengers was carried on the railway. Decline In the 1940s, the Jokioinen Railway faced growing competition from increasing road traffic. The war had slowed this competition down, but within 10 years passenger traffic had ended. The last passenger trains were withdrawn in 1954 and the railway started to use highway buses for its passenger services. Freight service continued for another 20 years. The Jokioinen Railway was able to stay competitive much longer than other narrow gauge railways in Finland because it used transporter wagons from the 1930s until end of services on the railway. With these pallet wagons, the broad () gauge VR freight cars could be transported on the narrow gauge railway. This way the slow and expensive transfer of freight at Humppila station could be avoided. By the end of the 1960s, however, the railway began to show signs of old age and wear. The track and the rolling stock were almost all more than 70 years old and large investments would have been needed to compete against the growing automobile and truck use, but the railway's owners were no longer willing to invest any more money in it. The last revenue freight train of the Jokioinen Railway ran on March 31, 1974, from Humppila to Forssa. In the same year of the railway between Forssa and Jokioinen was torn up and in 1975 the line between Minki√∂ and Humppila was also lifted. Today the remaining 7-kilometre line Minki√∂‚ÄìJokioinen and the rebuilt 8-kilometre line Minki√∂‚ÄìHumppila is operated by the Jokioinen Museum Railway.

Following Harless' birth, his mother contracted pneumonia, and died aged 21, when Harless was four months old. Harless recalled that his father \\"felt he couldn't keep all three\\" of his children and remarried once again, bringing Harless' older brother with him to a farm in South Point, Ohio, while his sister was raised by a relative in Charleston, and Harless was adopted by one of his aunts. He was raised by the sister of his late mother, Rosa, and her husband, George Erastus Ellis. They lived first in Mallory, in Logan County, but later moved to Gilbert, in Mingo County, when Harless was two years old. Harless attended Gilbert High School, from which he graduated in 1937. He had planned to later attend Marshall University in Huntington, however he was not able to afford the cost of this. He worked first at a local garage, and at a wrecker service, before working for several years at Red Jacket Coal Company, where he worked for his first six months with the cleaning of steel and machines, and keeping the production line free of falling slate. He worked then with dumping coal at a nearby mine for six months, before being transferred to the company's engineering department, where he stayed for a period of six years. He saved up a sum of $500 while working at Red Jacket, and gave up mining in 1947, to become a part-owner and manager of a Gilbert saw-mill. He laid the foundation for Gilbert Lumber Company, with the help of what he later recalled as \\"$500 and a one-horse sawmill.\\" Business career International Industries In 1947, Harless founded the Gilbert Lumber Company, where he produced mining equipment with the help of his sawmill. That same year, he also founded International Industries, which he grew over the years into a multimillion-dollar conglomerate. Harless served as president of Gilbert Lumber Company, until 1966, when he sold the company to Georgia- Pacific, who had offered to buy the company, as well as Harless' timber rights in the area, the previous year. As part of the contract signed with Georgia- Pacific, Harless was barred from conducting lumber business in the area for a period of 10 years, and instead established lumber businesses elsewhere. He expanded internationally, and set up operations in Brazil, as well as Guatemala. His sawmill operation in Brazil was located in the town of Abaetetuba, and its lumber was shipped via a vessel owned by Harless to a division of his company Gilbert Imported Hardwoods in Mobile, Alabama. He founded International Resources, a subsidiary of International Industries that operated in the coal industry, in 1966, and entered the mining industry that same year. International Industries was Harless' primary business entity, and as of March 2008 it was made up of more than 15 different companies. It was based primarily in natural resources such as coal mining and timber, but which also included the manufacturing, hotel and real estate industries. Its business was divided into three main sections, including International Resources, Inc. (coal mining and marketing company L&K; Coal), Gilco Lumber, Inc. (lumber production and distribution), and Benson International, Inc. (manufacturing of trailers and truck bodies), and had operations in five states serving domestic and international customers. He sold the conglomerate in 2007, and it was acquired by International Resource Partners, a limited partnership of Lightfoot Capital Partners, on June 12. Harless remained as chairman of the company past its acquisition by Lightfoot Capital Partners, however, and is known to have served until at least 2011, at which point the company was sold again. He transferred the ownership of Gilco Lumber Company to businessman Everett Hannah in 2009. Banking career In 1973, Harless formed Gilbert Bank & Trust, which was the first bank in Gilbert since the bankruptcy of the previous one in 1929. Harless served as chairman of the bank starting that same year, and remained until 1987, at which point Gilbert Bank & Trust merged into the Matewan National Bank. Harless was a director of Matewan both prior to and after the merger. Harless was also chairman of the American National Bank of Logan in the 1980s, chairman of Guyan Bancshares, Inc. from 1984 to 1987, and a director of the National Bank of West Virginia in Morgantown. In 1984, he offered to buy the National Bank of Logan together with one his partners, for a prize of US$18 million. Board memberships In March 1968, Harless was named to the board of trustees of non-profit healthcare system Appalachian Regional Hospitals. He was reelected to the board in 1973, as well as 1975, and is known to have served as its chairman in 1976. As of late 1977, Harless was no longer serving as chairman, however he continued to serve as a member of the board of Appalachian Regional Hospitals. In 1977, Harless was elected to the board of directors of C&P; Telephone. As of 1987, he was still serving as a director of the company. In May 2001 he was appointed to the Massey Energy board of directors, where he served as the chairman of the Public and Environmental Policy Committee, and as a member of the Governance Committee. Originally elected to serve on the board until 2006, he announced his premature resignation in February 2005. University board memberships Harless was a member of the board of the West Virginia University Foundation for a total of 19 years, and served as chairman from 1982 to 1985. He was serving as the board's vice chairman as of 1976, and is known to have been a member until at least 2004. In 1979, Harless was appointed to the university's advisory board. From 1985 to 1989, Harless was a member of the board of trustees of Davis & Elkins College. Harless was a former chairman of the board of advisors of Marshall University. Having been a member since at least 1988, he was elected chairman in 1989, for the term 1989‚Äì1990. He was still serving as chairman of the board in 1991, and was reelected again that same year. As of 1996, Harless was no longer serving as chairman of the board. He was elected member of the Marshall University Foundation in 1990, where he is known to have served in 1997, as well as 2001. In 2004 he was described as a former member of the foundation.  Political career  Early state career  In 1958, Harless was reported to be serving as chairman of the Governor's Forest Fire Prevention Conference, where he served alongside future circuit judge Kenneth Keller Hall among others. Harless was also a member of the West Virginia Forest Industries Committee, where he is known to have served as chairman in 1958. Harless was still serving as a member of the committee in 1962, and was reappointed as member in 1967. In 1959, he was elected chairman of the Extension Service Committee of Mingo County. In the 1960s, Harless served two terms as mayor of his hometown of Gilbert. Starting in 1959, he was reelected to the office in 1961, and served until his defeat in June 1963. He served as a member of the People's Party, of which he was also a former chairman. During his tenure, he oversaw the March 1963 flood that impacted the area.  Later state career  Harless was a former member of the board of trustees of the University System of West Virginia. Having first been appointed by governor Gaston Caperton in June 1989, together with members such as tax commissioner David Hardesty and district court judge Robert Maxwell, he declined the appointment, in order to protest Caperton's handling of the ongoing coal wildcat strikes. At the same time, he also resigned from West Virginia Roundtable Inc., an economic development group he had helped form in 1984 together with Caperton and other business leaders. Harless was serving as its vice chairman and as a member of the board of directors, and cited the same reasons for his resignation as that of his resignation from the University System of West Virginia. The strikes were part of the strikes against Pittston Coal, and were initiated at Harless' operations following his refusal to sign a national contract signed by the United Mine Workers with the Bituminous Coal Operators Association. As a result, Harless non-union operation Hampden Coal Company was subject to repeated stone throwings and stormings of guardhouses, as well as damage to several vehicles at the operation. Harless expressed dissatisfaction with governor Caperton's and the state police's handling of the violent pickets that occurred, and stated that although he had initially hoped that Caperton would be \\"the best governor this state has ever had,\\" he had written in his letter of resignation that he was \\"sorely disappointed\\" in his handling of the strikes. Harless eventually accepted another appointment to the state's university system board of directors, and took office on January 1, 1999. In the 1980s, Harless was a major financial contributor to West Virginia governor Arch Moore, and served as chairman of Moore's Governor's Management Task Force II. He praised the governor for his plan to introduce a tax of 4 cents per hour worked that would be in place for a period of 5 years, in order to pay off the unemployment benefit debt owed by West Virginia to the federal government. Harless considered this a relief on the burden placed on employers, and argued that payroll taxes prevented the economic development of West Virginia. Following Moore's federal conviction however, Harless chose not to speak openly about his earlier support of Moore. During the 1996 gubernatorial election, he was an important backer of Republican candidate Cecil H. Underwood, whose upset victory was largely attributed to Harless' early support for him. In the 2004 gubernatorial election, Harless initially supported his childhood friend Dan Moore, who was seeking the Republican nomination. In the general election, however, Harless voiced his support for Democratic candidate Joe Manchin, and later also his Democratic successor Earl Ray Tomblin. Ahead of the 2006 U.S. senate election, Harless made financial contributions to Republican primary candidate Hiram Lewis, as well as Democratic incumbent Robert Byrd. He was a financial contributor to West Virginia State Senate candidates, the West Virginia Republican Party, and politicians of both the Republican and Democratic Party.  Federal politics  Harless was a candidate for delegate to the 1956 Republican National Convention. He positioned himself as a \\"real Eisenhower candidate,\\" and as a supporter of Helen F. Holt and Chapman Revercomb. He was aligned with the faction of the state Republican Party opposed to the leadership of party boss Walter S. Hallanan, whom he blamed for the domination of the Democratic Party in the state since Hallanan became leader in 1928. Harless was an early supporter of the 2000 presidential campaign of George W. Bush and opponent of Democratic nominee Al Gore. Gore, who was known for his prominent environmental activism, was commonly referred to in West Virginia as an environmental extremist, and Harless feared that a Gore administration would put an end to mountaintop removal mining. He argued that Gore's policies would destroy West Virginia's coal-heavy economy. Leading up to the election, Harless served as finance chair of the George W. Bush campaign in West Virginia, and was credited by prominent Republicans Ken Mehlman and Karl Rove of helping Bush win the traditionally Democratic state of West Virginia. In an upset victory, that came to be described by The Wall Street Journal as a \\"political coup,\\" Harless successfully helped break a long-standing tradition of Democratic victories in the state, and West Virginia's five electoral votes ultimately gave Bush the majority needed to win the election. The political fundraising campaign organized by Harless raised US$275,000 for the Bush campaign, five times more than Al Gore collected statewide. His fundraising earned him the title of Bush Pioneer, and he was described by The New York Times as \\"the state's most prolific Republican fund-raiser.\\" Harless served as a presidential elector for the 2000 presidential election. He expressed dissatisfaction with the Electoral College system however, calling it a \\"terrible strain on the democracy.\\" In 2002, Harless was appointed by president Bush to the United States Air Force Academy Board of Visitors. He also served on the Bush Transition Energy Advisory Team. In 2004, he served again as West Virginia finance chair of Bush's presidential campaign. He was a vocal opponent of Bush's Democratic challenger John Kerry, and described his liberal views as \\"contrary to what West Virginians believe.\\" Harless introduced Bush to the crowd at the West Virginia Coal Association annual meeting on July 31, 2008. In the speech given by Bush, he remarked that Harless \\"came down to the governor's mansion, came down just to take a sniff.\\" Starting in 2011, Harless made political donations to Mitt Romney's campaign for president ahead of the 2012 election. Beliefs and activism Conservatism Harless described himself as a conservative both politically and religiously, and was an opponent of many liberal views, including same-sex marriage and abortions. He was described by the Bluefield Daily Telegraph] as a \\"strong advocate of his faith,\\" and disapproved of the \\"gradual turn [away] from God and prayer\\" that he observed of his nation. He expressed concern over efforts to remove the phrase \\"under God\\" from the Pledge of Allegiance of the United States, and questioned a decision by Concord University to replace the traditional prayer with meditation at its 2003 graduation ceremony. He claimed that welfare had \\"absolutely ruined the initiative of the people,\\" and as chairman of Appalachian Regional Hospitals stated that while he believed in providing healthcare to patients \\"without regard to their ability to pay,\\" the cost of providing free hospital care to those unable to pay had created an economic deficit that needed to be covered by new sources of revenue. Localism Harless was a proponent of keeping the lumber harvested in West Virginia contained within the state, in order to create jobs for the people of West Virginia. He described liberal arts colleges as being just as important as engineering colleges, and sought to encourage younger generations of West Virginians to remain in the state, and to prevent talented students from emigrating elsewhere. He expressed dissatisfaction with changes for the worse made by political leaders in the state, and noted that he had seen several opportunities for advancement that had not been pursued, as leaders had \\"put self ahead.\\" Following the departure of West Virginia University president Gene Budig to another university of a similar size, Harless recognized that Budig had been offered \\"a much more attractive salary\\" for his transfer, and became an advocate for a policy that would allow private donations to supplement the salaries of university administrators in the state, in order to \\"attract and keep the type of leadership\\" that he described as necessary for institutions of higher education. He criticized the state funding of administrative salaries, and called on state officials to improve the salaries of public university staff, arguing that the existing salaries did not sufficiently prevent talented administrators from moving to states where they were able to earn more. As part of his initiative, Harless contributed $21,000 to the yearly salary of West Virginia University president E. Gordon Gee, first as an anonymous donor before later revealing his identity. His contribution faced criticism from employees at the university, however, who argued that the contribution of funds from an anonymous donor could be subject to a potential conflict of interest. Environmental skepticism On a number of occasions, Harless criticized several statements and claims made by environmentalists. He was a prominent critic of Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore, and argued that his environmentalist policies would destroy West Virginia‚Äôs coal industries. In 1994, he accused laws advocated by environmentalists of hindering the ability to mine coal in coal-dependent areas like McDowell County, however he also at the same time recognized the factor of depletion in coal mining, and advocated for preparing coal-heavy regions for \\"a future when the coal would be gone.\\" Regarding his views on environmental policies, Harless was described as having \\"a coal baron's talent for exploiting natural resources and an environmentalist's belief in making them sustainable,\\" and said of himself that he believed in \\"protecting nature as much as you can, [but nature is] put here by our maker for our use.\\" In regards to his role as a timber operator in Brazil, Harless claimed that environmentalists were \\"dead wrong\\" on the issue of exploitation of South American resources, and argued that the deforestation in the area was caused by the burning of land for farming, rather than by the forestry industry, and claimed that only \\"about four or five out of two hundred\\" wood species in the Amazon basin were economically merchantable. Harless was a supporter of mountaintop removal mining, and praised the method of coal mining for the resulting flat surfaces that Harless described as beneficial to the mountainous landscape of West Virginia. He described the terrain of his home state as \\"unfortunate\\" and as having \\"no room on which to build housing,\\" and in 1975 made plans to construct a large housing estate and shopping center on a local mountaintop with the help of mountaintop removal mining, noting also that the construction of the estate could not be afforded without extracting the coal in the mountain. Labor unions Although described as an \\"outspoken opponent of labor unions,\\" Harless stated himself that he had \\"nothing against unions,\\" and that his concerns with them mostly had to do with labor leaders, as well as work rules and productivity, rather than the wages of workers. In a 1964 incident however, Harless blamed recurring labor disputes for being the cause of the shutdown of a West Virginia woodworking factory of which he served as chairman. Harless said that these had chased away many prominent management staffers, which along with failed attempts to resolve the disputes had led to the plant's shutdown. Harless attributed the frequent labor disputes to demands for higher wages made by trade unions, and argued that the plant would have been better off had it not invested in the retraining of unemployed coal miners. In 1983, Harless withdrew from Bituminous Coal Operators Association, following disagreements with a contract that had been negotiated by UMW chairman Richard Trumka and the chairman of Consolidation Coal Company. He regarded the contract as giving too much power to unions, and believed it to have been designed in order to put smaller unionized coal operations like his own out of business. Harless had previously been a member of UMW in his youth, and had agreed to contracts negotiated by UMW and BCOA since he first entered the mining industry in 1966. Awards and recognitions Harless was inducted into the West Virginia Coal Hall of Fame in 1998. The West Virginia Mining and Reclamation Association named him the Coal Man of the Year in 1976. In 1983, the Charleston Gazette- Mail named Harless West Virginian of the Year. In 2001 he was named to the West Virginia Business Hall of Fame. Personal life Harless was described by U.S. senator Joe Manchin as a \\"dear personal friend,\\" and was said to have had a \\"tight bond\\" with businessman James Justice Sr., the father of future West Virginia governor Jim Justice. On Christmas Eve of 2013, Harless health began to suddenly weaken, and Harless died, following a brief illness, on January 1, 2014 at his home in Gilbert, West Virginia, aged 94. His death was acknowledged by West Virginia senators Jay Rockefeller and Joe Manchin, governor Earl Ray Tomblin and attorney general Patrick Morrisey, as well as representative Nick Rahall and the state Republican Party. Statements were also issued by university presidents Stephen J. Kopp, of Marshall University, and E. Gordon Gee, of West Virginia University. Representative Shelley Moore Capito, secretary of state Natalie Tennant and America's Got Talent winner Landau Eugene Murphy Jr. spoke of Harless' death via the website Twitter.

Mondegreen released his third and self-titled album in September 2012. Shelflife Records released the album in the United States. AllMusic gave it 4,5/5 stars and called it \\"a quiet masterpiece ... flawlessly written and performed, and produced with uncommon skill and grace - it's likely one of the best singer/songwriter records of 2012, and most any year that came before\\". The album was co-produced and mixed by Ian Catt, best known for his work with Saint Etienne. Mondegreen has played shows in the United States, the United Kingdom, China, Japan, Italy and Norway. He has featured in articles in Pitchfork, NME, Under The Radar, Spin and more. The surname is based on Lady Mondegreen, a character of myth and legend. Jon Carroll, columnist for the San Francisco Chronicle, periodically runs a story which gives the truth about \\"Mondegreen\\". A mondegreen is a mishearing of the lyrics of popular songs. The name itself comes from Carroll's mishearing of a line in a song from his youth, about a valiant man who villains killed \\"and laid him on the green\\". He heard this as \\"Lady Mondegreen\\". American writer, Sylvia Wright, coined the term in her essay \\"The Death of Lady Mondegreen,\\" published in Harper's Magazine in November 1954.

T.204-1957 The Devonshire Hunting Tapestries are a group of four magnificent Flemish tapestries dating from the mid-fifteenth century. These enormous works, each over 3 metres wide, depict men and women in fashionable dress of the early fifteenth century hunting in a forest. The tapestries formerly belonged to the Dukes of Devonshire, but in 1957 were accepted by HM Government in lieu of tax payable on the estate of the 10th Duke of Devonshire and allocated to the Victoria and Albert Museum, where they remain. The 6th Duke described using his 'spare' tapestry to insulate the Long Gallery at Hardwick Hall in the 1840s, a practice which saved these rare Gothic hangings from being discarded. The tapestries depict a Deer Hunt, Falconry, a Swan and Otter Hunt and a Boar and Bear Hunt. The hunt was a particularly powerful theme and would have been a familiar pastime to many of the high-born individuals and families who owned tapestries. Hunting was both a stylized sport and an important source of the only meats considered noble. This detail is from the Boar and Bear Hunt Tapestry, made in the 1420s, and shows men carrying special boar-spears, which have cross-bars designed to stop the charge of the boar and keep its deadly tusks at arm's length. Much of the charm of these scenes lies in the elaborate costume detail. The lady crossing the stream on the lower right has 'Monte le Desire' inscribed on her flowing sleeve. This is the opening line of a popular song of the period. The practice of embellishing one's clothes with such words was a medieval equivalent of having a stylish slogan printed on a T-shirt except that, in the tapestry, weaving on a horizontal loom has reversed the letters. The dress of the participants is of the type worn at court, particularly that of Burgundy, which had control of the tapestry-weaving areas in the southern Netherlands. It is unlikely that any serious hunting took place in such restricting and exotic clothes.

This was a contravention of Irish neutrality and was not publicised at the time. Background When the Second World War broke out in September 1939, Ireland remained neutral, in accordance with its pre-declared neutrality policy. The Battle of the Atlantic commenced soon after war was declared. German U-boats attacked Allied shipping convoys in the Atlantic Ocean, where hundreds of ships were sunk and thousands of lives lost, resulting in a very serious situation for the Allied forces. In December 1940, a survey was carried out on Lough Erne with a view to having flying boat bases built there. This was the most westerly point in the United Kingdom from where planes could patrol the Atlantic and offer some protection to the shipping convoys against the dreaded U-boats. Early in 1941, the first flying boats were based on Lough Erne. They were not permitted to fly over the territory of Ireland. This meant that they had first to fly northwards, then change their flight path and go west. Some limited protection could be given to the convoys coming to the UK from the US and Canada, the same protection could be given by American-based aircraft. Still, there was a gap where the U-boats could create havoc unhindered. This mid-Atlantic area was known as the Black Gap. Ireland came under extreme pressure from the British and even the USA, who at this time were themselves neutral, to dispense with its neutrality policy and join with the Allies. A meeting took place in January 1941 between √âamon de Valera and Sir John Maffey, the British representative in Dublin. An agreement was reached whereby the Lough Erne-based flying boats were permitted to fly across a stretch of neutral territory from Belleek in County Fermanagh to Ballyshannon in County Donegal and thereby gain access to the Atlantic Ocean. This agreement was concluded in The Cranborne Report. To pacify the Germans, these aircraft were supposed to follow a defined route and then only on air/sea rescue missions. This flight path became known as 'The Donegal Corridor'. The original agreement and rules were soon changed and the flying boats went on missions to the mid-Atlantic, to the west coast of France and to Iceland to protect convoys on those routes. This was a turning point in the Battle of the Atlantic which was the longest battle of the Second World War. Some nine U-boats were confirmed as having been sunk by the Lough Erne Sunderland and Catalina flying boats and many others so badly damaged that they had to return to base in France. Location Between Lough Melvin in Co Leitrim and the River Erne in Co Donegal, Co Donegal narrows and separates the Northern Irish Co Fermanagh from Donegal Bay and the Atlantic. The long Corridor was between Belleek and the coast beyond Ballyshannon, along the course of the River Erne The base itself was at RAF Castle Archdale. Use The first official flight along the Corridor was on 21 February 1941 by No. 240 Squadron RAF's Supermarine Stranraer flying boats. Conditions of the concession included that flights should be made at a \\"good height\\" and that aircraft should not fly over the military camp at Finner; these conditions appear to have been ignored by both sides. A notable episode was when a Consolidated Catalina flying boat from No. 209 Squadron RAF based at Lough Erne observed and pinpointed the German battleship Bismarck in 1941, a stroke of tactical intelligence that helped lead to the warship's destruction. By the end of the war, 320 men had died in 41 missions by flying boats based at Lough Erne. In 2007, memorial plaques were unveiled in Counties Donegal and Fermanagh.

It was established in 2004,and covers an area of 125.000 ha. Much of the park is forested with Atlas cedar.Anthony Ham, Paula Hardy and Alison Bing. 2007 Ifrane National Park is one of the few remaining habitats for the Barbary macaque, Macaca sylvanus; this primate prehistorically had a much broader range in North Africa, but currently survives as an endangered species in narrowly restricted and fragmented habitats.C. Michael Hogan. 2008 Creation Ifrane National Park was conceived in 1994 and established in October 2004 due to many reasons such as the existence of remarkable species in the territory, the presence of internationally important ecosystems, and the increase of human activity and resource exploitation. Since the 1990s, Morocco got involved in the conception of strategies that can help in protecting the environment and biodiversity through projects and conventions such as Ramsar. Ifrane National Park is one of the strategies that the Moroccan state came up with in order to demonstrate the importance of its forests and ecosystems. Territory The park initially covered an area of 53800 ha, and got enlarged in April 2008 so as to currently cover 125.000 ha. The zone encompasses some of the most ecologically sensitive areas such as wetlands and high-altitude forests. It is believed that the park's altitude varies between 1300 and 2400 meters including the cedar forest located in the province of Ifrane. It was stated that the park contains 1/10 of the Atlas Cedar in the world, 1/4 of the world's population of the Barbary Macaque, and two Ramsar sites: the two lakes Afennourir and Tifounassine. Additionally, included in Ifrane National Park's territory are the following 'daiyat', as in lakes, and forests: * Dait Aoua * Dait Hachlaf * Dait Ifrah * Tallount * Kharzouza * Ain Kahla Objectives The park was created with these three intentions: * protecting biodiversity and ecosystems * raising awareness of the environment and eco-tourism * sustainable development of natural resources Natural Reserve The park constitutes a very important natural reserve to Morocco since it is biologically and geologically diverse. Flora The area has 1015 different plant species including the Atlas Cedar (Cedrus Atlantica), the Evergreen Oak (Quercus Ilex), the Algerian Oak (Quercus Canariensis), the Maritime Pine (Pinus Pinaster), and the Spanish Juniper (Juniperus Thunifera). Other tree species that exist in the park include the Montpellier maple, the yew, and the holly. File:C√®dre de l'Atlas.JPGCedrus atlantica in the Park File:Ifrane 080.jpgQuercus canariensis Fauna The park contains a rich fauna. It constitutes a natural living environment for the endangered monkey species the Barbary Macaque. Moreover, in the park one can find wild Barbary boars, the golden Jackal, the Serval, the Caracal, and the Common Genet. In addition, the park is a place where various bird species keep showing up. In fact, Afennourir Lake is a Ramsar Site where you can find a shelter for bird-watching. The bird species that can be found in the lake include coots, also called Fulica, snipes, and egrets.

He was apparently an ancient Roman astronomer. Although, from Augustine's brief and second-hand account, we can know very little of his life or works, he was cited as an authoritative astronomical observer from antiquity. According to Augustine's De Civitate Dei contra Paganos, Varro (116 BC ‚Äì 27 BC) the Roman scholar and writer, cited Adrastus and Dion as authorities for the dating of an astronomical phenomenon involving Venus, describing them as mathematici nobiles (distinguished astronomers, or possibly astrologers). Again according to Augustine, Varro recorded this in his work De gente populi Romani.Augustine. De Civitate Dei. Book XXI, Chapter 8 Although Varro's writing is now lost, Augustine quoted from it: Augustine used these ancient astronomical reports to further his what has been called his \\"epistemic theory of miracles\\". Here, Augustine argued that if Varro called the phenomenon that Adrastus and Dion reported, a \\"portent\\", then it could not be contrary to nature, but must simply be inexplicable under our current understanding of nature.
