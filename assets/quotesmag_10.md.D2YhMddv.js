She is currently a member of the Virginia Senate for the 11th District, representing Amelia County, the city of Colonial Heights, and part of Chesterfield County. On February 17, 2020, Chase announced her run for Governor of Virginia in 2021, making her the first ever female Republican candidate for governor in Virginia. Early life and education Chase was born in Sheffield, Alabama to Dorsey and Tena Freeman. She grew up in the community of Bon Air, Virginia, and attended Chesterfield County Public Schools. After graduating from Monacan High School in 1988, she went on to attend Virginia Tech. In 1992, she graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Business, majoring in Corporate Finance and Business Management. Professional career Since June 2013, Chase has worked as an Independent Division Leader with Primerica Financial Services. Prior to that, she served in management roles at First North American National Bank, Signet Bankcard (now Capital One), the Virginia Student Assistance Authorities and the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. Political career Chase first became involved in local politics due to a zoning issue that affected her neighborhood, serving on a steering committee that would ultimately succeed in blocking the proposed zoning change. She then went on to serve as the Chesterfield County Coordinator for Attorney General candidate Ken Cuccinelli, Deputy Volunteer Coordinator for the McDonnell Inaugural Committee and as Political Director for then-Congressman Eric Cantor (2010) and Randy Forbes (2012). Chase was briefly the Campaign Manager for Congressman Dave Brat following his defeat of Cantor in the 2014 primary. From 2010 to 2014, Chase ran a campaign management firm that sought to help grassroots conservatives run for office. Her clients included 2010 U.S. Senate Candidate Jamie Radtke, Congressman Randy Forbes (VA-4), 2013 Republican Lt. Governor Candidate Susan Stimpson, 2014 Republican Congressional Candidate Dave Brat (VA-7), the Women for Ken PAC, and many other local and state legislators and elected officials.  Virginia State Senate On July 10, 2014, Chase filed to run for the Republican nomination in Virginia's 11th State Senate District. Her primary opponents were incumbent Senator Stephen H. Martin and businessman Barry Moore. She defeated both challengers and went on to face Democrat Wayne Powell in the general election. At the general election on November 3, 2015, Chase defeated Powell by a wide margin to become the district's Senator-Elect. She assumed office on January 13, 2016. On November 22, 2019, Chase announced that she will no longer caucus with the Republicans in the State Senate in 2020, although she still is a Republican state Senator. Her reason for doing so was the supposed broken and failed Republican leadership and lack of transparency. Election results    Controversies = Wearing a firearm in session  On January 15, 2019, Chase openly carried a .38 caliber firearm in a custom holster while presenting bills to a Senate committee. She said \\"it‚Äôs a deterrent for over- exuberant folks\\" in explaining why she openly carried a loaded firearm into the Senate committee meeting.  Cursing at Capitol Police officer over a parking spot  On March 22, 2019, Chase reportedly became \\"irate\\" and used supposed profanities at Capitol Police officers after being told that she was not allowed to park in the secured Pedestrian Plaza on Bank Street where she would park at times during session.  Comments about rape  In a post on Facebook about the Second Amendment, which was made on Tuesday, July 2, 2019, she said \\"[i]t‚Äôs those who are naive and unprepared that end up raped. Sorry. But I‚Äôm not going to be a statistic.\\" This statement of hers was subject to considerable backlash. Many people asserted that her comment was insensitive to the predicament of recovery that many rape victims undergo and other people asserted that she was blaming victims. In response to the public criticism, Chase posted a video to the same Facebook page as the one that she used to make the comment about rape. She did not apologize in the video and she said that her reply was \\"taken out of context.\\" She also attacked her critics as \\"trolls\\".  Confederate monuments  Chase opposes removing the Robert E. Lee Monument in Richmond, Virginia, which has become a flashpoint of protests in recent times. \\"Removing the Robert E. Lee statue is a cowardly capitulation to the looters and domestic terrorists.\\" Chase further stated that the removal of Confederate statues is an \\"overt effort to erase all white history.\\" See also * 2020 VCDL Lobby Day References *  Additional sources  1969 births 21st-century American women politicians 21st-century American politicians Living people People from Bon Air, Virginia People from Midlothian, Virginia People from Sheffield, Alabama Virginia Republicans Virginia Tech alumni Women state legislators in Virginia ","title":"Amanda Chase"},{"id":"48456283","text":"Woodcut of an actor delivering the prologue of L'Amfiparnaso, Venice 1597 L'Amfiparnaso is a madrigal comedy by composer Orazio Vecchi. It was published in Venice in 1597.  Composition history  Madrigal comedy, or Commedia harmonica (as known in the 16th century Italian vernacular) was a genre that flourished briefly from 1590 for about twenty years, previous to the first operas. Some of them were collections of pieces, while others used commedia dell'arte characters and told a full story through the medium of three or five-voice ensemble. The two principal composers were Adriano Banchieri and Orazio Vecchi, both contemporaries of Claudio Monteverdi.  Performance history  Although in the dedication Vecchi describes the dedicatee, Alessandro D'Este, as having heard a performance of L'Amfiparnaso, the date of the premiere is unknown. In 1844 historian Fran√ßois-Joseph F√©tis proposed a date of 1594 for the work's premiere, but this was based on incorrect assumptions about the early history of opera and Vecchi's place in it.Paul Schleuse, \\"A Tale Completed in the Mind: Genre and Imitation in L'Amfiparnaso (1597),\\" Journal of Musicology 29 (2012) pp. 108-115. http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/jm.2012.29.2.101 Characters Pantalone - central figure of Commedia dell'arte Doctor Gratiano - the old man Captain Cardon Lovers - Isabella, Lucio, Lelio, Nisa The Zanni - Pedrolino, Zanni, Francatrippa, Frulla  Synopsis  Act 1 Scene 1. Pantalone is smitten by the charms of the courtesan Hortensia, but the ungrateful woman is not interested in the old man's affections. Scene 2. Lelio is doubtful about the feelings of his beloved Nisa, and concludes from her present of a flower that there is little love in her for him. Scene 3. Pantalone promises his daughter Isabella to doctor Gratiano, because he likes the clumsy fellow, who answers badly and listens even worse. Act 2 Scene 1. Because he believes that his beloved Isabella is in love with Captain Cardone, in utter jealousy Lucio announces to jump in the abyss. Scene 2. Cardone quarrels with Zane, because after many hints he won't understand him, but he rather confuses him so that his answers are strange. Nevertheless, eventually he knocks on Isabella's door. Scene 3. Isabella pretends to be in love with the Spanish Captain, so that when she dies she would more hurt his insatiable desires. Scene 4. As soon as the Captain is gone Isabella bursts out lamenting for Lucio. She draws courageously a dagger to depart from life. Scene 5. Frulla persuades Isabella not to thrust the dagger by announcing her that her lover Lucio is still alive. Act 3 Scene 1. As the wedding contract between Pantalone and Gratiano has been agreed now, they joyfully start planning the festivities. Scene 2. With a melting and enamoured voice the Doctor sings a gracious madrigal under the balcony of his lovely bride. Scene 3. Francatrippa goes to the Jews to pawn a hangmat. He knocks at the door and a noise is heard of many voices in unspeakable languages. Scene 4. From a distance the faithful lovers meet rejoicing in their presence, pledging to be true till death. Scene 5. Everybody is now content and happy. Isabella and Lucio are wed and a great exchange of valuable gifts is displayed.  Recordings  Many recordings of L'Amfiparnaso exist with a variety of performance style choices. A 2003 DVD recording by I Fagiolini, directed by Robert Hollingworth, chooses to forego any text or scene, but does however introduce each piece with an English introduction narrated by Simon Callow. Numerous recordings exist using multiple numbers of singers and drastically different choices of accompaniment.  References  * \\"L'Amfiparnaso (1597) (The Twin Peaks of Parnassus)\\". DVD 2004.

Between 1968 and 1971, he worked at the Dunedin Public Art Gallery as an assistant director. In 1972, he joined the newly amalgamated Waikato Museum and Art Gallery. There he curated the 1973 exhibition Taranaki Saw it All: The Story of Te Whiti O Rongomai of Parihaka, ‚Äòstepping into a cross-cultural role that few had undertaken in the gallery environment of the time.‚Äô In 1974, Mack began four years at the East West Centre in Honolulu as a Senior Fellow and visiting Research Associate. He then worked as a project manager for the Queen Elizabeth II Arts Council in the late 1970s. Dowse Art Museum James Mack was the director of The Dowse Art Museum in Lower Hutt between 1981 and 1988. Art historian Douglas Lloyd Jenkins writes 'Under the directorship of James Mack...The Dowse Art Museum in Lower Hutt championed New Zealand craft and repositioned the gallery as a repository of decorative rather than fine arts.' Mack redefined The Dowse's collection policy so that the focus was upon building a nationally and internationally significant collection of craft and applied art, including ceramics, jewellery, glass and textile art. The Dowse also programmed exhibitions that celebrated a range of craft artists and their practices, such as Pakohe in 1986, which celebrated master craftsmen working in stone. National Museum In 1988, Mack moved into a public services role at the National Museum (now the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa). Mack curated Treasures of the Underworld, a glass and clay exhibition created for the New Zealand pavilion at the 1992 Seville Expo. The exhibition featured 48 works by top New Zealand craft practitioners and was themed to celebrate the 500th anniversary of Christopher Columbus‚Äô first voyage to America. Later life Mack retired to the Wairarapa, establishing a small gallery in Featherston. At the age of 60, he changed his name to Galvan Macnamara, his father's name.

The film stars Michael Cera, Samuel L. Jackson, Ricky Gervais, George Takei, Gabriel Iglesias, Djimon Hounsou, Michelle Yeoh, Mel B and Brooks himself.  Plot Hank (Michael Cera), a scrappy dog who dreams of becoming a samurai, arrives in a strange land entirely inhabited by cats. Hank meets the nefarious warlord Ika Chu (Ricky Gervais), who hustles an unwitting Hank into becoming the samurai for the town of Kakamucho where Hank meets Jimbo (Samuel L. Jackson), a once great cat samurai who reluctantly takes Hank under his wing and teaches him what being a samurai really means. Forging the first real friendship between a cat and a dog, the two set off on a journey to save the town of Kakamucho from the evil Ika Chu, and ultimately, Hank learns what it means to become a true samurai.  Cast  * Michael Cera as Hank, the eager dreamer: From fumbling fido to fearless friend, Hank becomes a true samurai, loyal to his new pack and true to himself. * Samuel L. Jackson as Jimbo, the reluctant mentor: Once famed, now shamed. Thanks to his home-brewed catnip, this former Kyoto Kat (the fastest sword in the East) is now the cockeyed cat of Kakamucho. Jimbo reluctantly mentors Hank. Through their friendship, this lost cat finds himself. * Ricky Gervais as Ika Chu, the sneaky bad cat: Deputy Senior Executive Regional Warlord of the Shogun. An all-around baddie whose dreams of a newfangled litter-box system (the first flushable toilet) is threatened by the town of Kakamucho. * Heavenly Joy Jerkins as Emiko, the girl who believes: This plucky young kitten becomes the first real champion of the new dog in town, Hank. A natural warrior in training, this pint-sized puff can turn into a white-hot ball of feline fury when least expected. * Djimon Hounsou as Sumo, the gentle giant. This towering tabby may fight with brute force, but Sumo is just a \\"prawn in the sea of life.\\" Dragged into combat by the bad cats around him, Sumo is won over by Hank‚Äôs kindness and finds enlightenment on his journey. * Mel Brooks as Shogun, the misguided but benevolent supreme leader. What the Shogun lacks in stature, he makes up for in empathy, teaching that tolerance goes a long way in solving seemingly big problems. * George Takei as Ohga, Ika‚Äôs henchman and number-one goon. * Gabriel Iglesias as Chuck, one of Kakamucho's cat citizens. * Michelle Yeoh as Yuki, Emiko's over-protective mom. * Aasif Mandvi as Ichiro, one of Kakamucho's cat citizens. * Sandra Tsing Loh as Little Mama * Mel B as The Giraffe (cameo) * Randy Orton as Teddy (cameo) Production According to documents filed at UK's Companies House the film's producers Yair Landau and Susan Purcell resigned as directors of the production company Blazing Productions Limited on July 5, 2017. Arc Productions were contracted to provide the bulk of the animation production services on Blazing Samurai. Grosvenor Park Media Fund LP had provided a loan facility of up to $45.3 million to Arc Productions. According to an article dated August 2, 2016 entitled \\"Samurai Film Delivered Final Blow to Arc Productions\\" in The Globe and Mail, following an e-mail on July 26, 2016 from GFM Films to Grosvenor, Grosvenor called in their loan and forced Arc into receivership. On August 2, 2016 GFM posted the following message on its website \\"We received news late yesterday that Toronto-based Arc Productions has been placed into an interim receivership by its lender. Arc Productions were contracted last year to provide the bulk of the animation production services on Blazing Samurai. Blazing Samurai is supported by strong financial partners in China & the UK who have been advised of these developments today. We're doing everything we can to transition to a new animation facility as quickly as possible and to meet our current production schedule. The Blazing production team in Los Angeles will continue in full operation during this transition period.\\" No updates on GFM's website since this date so it is not clear whether GFM has managed to transition to a new animation facility. According to Hardman & Co., the budget for Blazing Samurai was ¬£23m and Ober Private Clients assisted in the financing of this film through an EIS fund raise. The breakdown of financing was ¬£5m EIS raise; debt finance of ¬£12m; a ¬£5m investment from a Chinese Distributor plus Canadian Film Council Tax credits which made up the balance. Hardman & Co. credits Ober Private Clients to \\"attracting top talent to this film, with the starring actors being rewarded on the film profitability rather than taking a more traditional fee. Keeping costs as low as possible is imperative given that it is impossible to predict the success rates of films\\". On February 5, 2015, Open Road Films acquired the US rights to Mass Animation's animated film Blazing Samurai scheduling it for an April 14, 2017 release. Chris Bailey was hired to direct the film based on the script by Ed Stone & Nate Hopper. The film is being produced by Rob Minkoff through Flying Tigers Entertainment, Yair Landau and Susan Purcell through Mass Animation, with GFM Films handling international sales. Sony Pictures International acquired rights to some international countries. On August 7, 2020, Align has taken control of the film.https://www.animationmagazine.net/features/blazing-samurai-gains-finance- ally-in-align/  Release  Blazing Samurai was scheduled to release on April 14, 2017 but Open Road Films has postponed the film's release to August 4, 2017, then May 11, 2018, then indefinitely. In November 2019 Screen Daily said the film was fully funded after years of troubled production, with companies such as Aniventure and Cinesite Animation having joined the production of the film, and with a new director to be named and tentative 2021 release date.

It was built in 1922 by F W Webb. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The Brooweena War Memorial was erected by the residents of the Woocoo Shire in late 1922. It is not known who designed the monument but it was produced by Maryborough monumental masonry firm F W Webb. The marble and sandstone memorial honours the 39 local men who served during the First World War including the 10 fallen. A later set of plates records the 43 local men and women who served in the Second World War. The strength of Brooweena's patriotic support during the First World War was remarkable. It funded an ambulance for France and has another memorial (a privately funded bridge) south of the town. The size of the digger memorial is large in comparison to the size of the town. Australia, and Queensland in particular, had few civic monuments before the First World War. The memorials erected in its wake became our first national monuments, recording the devastating impact of the war on a young nation. Australia lost 60 000 from a population of about 4 million, representing one in five of those who served. No previous or subsequent war has made such an impact on the nation. Even before the end of the war, memorials became a spontaneous and highly visible expression of national grief. To those who erected them, they were as sacred as grave sites, substitute graves for the Australians whose bodies lay in battlefield cemeteries in Europe and the Middle East. British policy decreed that the Empire war dead were to be buried where they fell. The word \\"cenotaph\\", commonly applied to war memorials at the time, literally means \\"empty tomb\\". Australian war memorials are distinctive in that they commemorate not only the dead. Australians were proud that their first great national army, unlike other belligerent armies, was composed entirely of volunteers, men worthy of honour whether or not they made the supreme sacrifice. Many memorials honour all who served from a locality, not just the dead, providing valuable evidence of community involvement in the war. Such evidence is not readily obtainable from military records, or from state or national listings, where names are categorised alphabetically or by military unit. Australian war memorials are also valuable evidence of imperial and national loyalties, at the time, not seen as conflicting; the skills of local stonemasons, metalworkers and architects; and of popular taste. In Queensland, the soldier statue was the popular choice of memorial, whereas the obelisk predominated in the southern states, possibly a reflection of Queensland's larger working-class population and a lesser involvement of architects. Many of the First World War monuments have been updated to record local involvement in later conflicts, and some have fallen victim to unsympathetic re-location and repair. Although there are many different types of memorials in Queensland, the digger statue is the most common. It was the most popular choice of communities responsible for erecting the memorials, embodying the ANZAC Spirit and representing the qualities of the ideal Australian: loyalty, courage, youth, innocence and masculinity. The digger was a phenomenon peculiar to Queensland, perhaps due to the fact that other states had followed Britain's lead and established Advisory Boards made up of architects and artists, prior to the erection of war memorials. The digger statue was not highly regarded by artists and architects who were involved in the design of relatively few Queensland memorials. Most statues were constructed by local masonry firms, although some were by artists or imported. The origin of this digger memorial is unclear. The pedestal is of a style not found elsewhere in Queensland and the inscription is also considered to be unusual. The monument originally stood in front of St Mary's Church of England about three miles from Brooweena on the Maryborough-Biggenden Road in Teebar (now within Boompa). It was unveiled there on Saturday 6 January 1923 by Major-General Thomas William Glasgow. Prompted by fears of vandalism, it was moved to its present location in late 1992.  Description  War memorial in the grounds of the Woocoo Historical Museum, 2008 The First World War Memorial is situated in the grounds of The Woocoo Historical Museum. It comprises an unusually designed pedestal surmounted by a digger statue. The sandstone memorial sits on a concrete base step. Above this are three smooth- faced sandstone steps, two of which are the same width, separated by a thinner step. On the front face of the two larger steps are leaded marble plaques bearing the names of the men and women who served in the Second World War. The uppermost step is capped with a cyma recta moulding from which the square pedestal projects. Marble plates are located on the side and front faces of the pedestal and bear an inscription in the form of a verse, the names of the 10 local men who fell and the 39 others who served in the First World War. Semi-circular hood-moulds are located over the top of each plaque. A series of moulded steps sit above this, on which the digger statue stands. The digger statue stands with his head erect and his hands resting on top of a rifle which is in the reversed position and rests on the top of the right boot. A tree stump support is located behind and to the right side of the statue.  Heritage listing  Brooweena War Memorial was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. War Memorials are important in demonstrating the pattern of Queensland's history as they are representative of a recurrent theme that involved most communities throughout the state. They provide evidence of an era of widespread Australian patriotism and nationalism, particularly during and following the First World War. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. This particular statue is of aesthetic value, both for its prominence as a landmark in the town and for its unusual pedestal design and inscription. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The monuments manifest a unique documentary record and are demonstrative of popular taste in the inter-war period. Erected in 1922, the memorial at Brooweena demonstrates the principal characteristics of a commemorative structure erected as an enduring record of a major historical event. This is achieved through the use of appropriate materials and design elements. As a digger statue it is representative of the most popular form of memorial in Queensland. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. This particular statue is of aesthetic value, both for its prominence as a landmark in the town and for its unusual pedestal design and inscription. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. It has a strong association with the community as evidence of the impact of a major historic event. This memorial is also significant as evidence of the extraordinary patriotism of the people of Brooweena.

It was designed by Lawrence Stevens Smith and built in 1921 by Frederick William Webb. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The Brooweena War Memorial Bridge was officially opened on 21 May 1921 by local clergyman the Rev Hardingham. Mrs A Brown, whose son was among the fallen, performed the unveiling of the honour roll. The memorial honours the 9 local men who fell during the First World War. Australia, and Queensland in particular, had few civic monuments before the First World War. The memorials erected in its wake became our first national monuments, recording the devastating impact of the war on a young nation. Australia lost 60 000 from a population of about 4 million, representing one in five of those who served. No previous or subsequent war has made such an impact on the nation. Even before the end of the war, memorials became a spontaneous and highly visible expression of national grief. To those who erected them, they were as sacred as grave sites, substitute graves for the Australians whose bodies lay in battlefield cemeteries in Europe and the Middle East. British policy decreed that the Empire war dead were to be buried where they fell. The word \\"cenotaph\\", commonly applied to war memorials at the time, literally means \\"empty tomb\\". Australian war memorials are distinctive in that they commemorate not only the dead. Australians were proud that their first great national army, unlike other belligerent armies, was composed entirely of volunteers, men worthy of honour whether or not they made the supreme sacrifice. Many memorials honour all who served from a locality, not just the dead, providing valuable evidence of community involvement in the war. Such evidence is not readily obtainable from military records, or from state or national listings, where names are categorised alphabetically or by military unit. Australian war memorials are also valuable evidence of imperial and national loyalties, at the time, not seen as conflicting; the skills of local stonemasons, metalworkers and architects; and of popular taste. In Queensland, the soldier statue was the popular choice of memorial, whereas the obelisk predominated in the southern states, possibly a reflection of Queensland's larger working-class population and a lesser involvement of architects. Many of the First World War monuments have been updated to record local involvement in later conflicts, and some have fallen victim to unsympathetic re-location and repair. Although there were many different types of memorials throughout Queensland, this is the only known example of a memorial bridge. It was designed and funded by Lawrence Stevens Smith of Mount Joseph station and, apart from the masonry piers, was constructed by his station hands, some of whom were returned soldiers. The masonry work was carried out by F W Webb of Maryborough. Although the Smiths lost no sons in the First World War, they still wished to make their own commemorative gesture. Upon completion of the bridge, it was handed over to the Woocoo Shire Council. This is indicative of the strength of Brooweena's patriotic support during the First World War. The residents of the town and surrounding district funded an ambulance in France and another memorial (the Brooweena War Memorial) in the form of a digger statue is located in the town. The bridge remained in use until a new structure was built in 1972. Shortly after this date, Mr Smith jnr erected a commemorative cairn explaining the significance of the bridge. It remains as a local attraction within the area.  Description  The First World War Memorial Bridge is located south of Brooweena on the Brooweena-Woolooga Road. Apart from the memorial pillars, it is a typical country bridge located in a treed landscape. It is constructed of timber and is supported by piers to form a slight arch over a small creek. A simple white painted timber balustrade runs between the pairs of pillars located at either end. The white painted sandstone pillars sit on stepped bases and have pedimented entablatures. On the approach side of each pillar are leaded marble plaques. Those at the northern approach bear the names of the nine local men who fell and the theatres of war where they died on one side, and the names of the 38 local soldiers who returned on the other. The pillars at the southern approach display the dates of the First World War.  Heritage listing  The War Memorial Bridge at Brooweena was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. War Memorials are important in demonstrating the pattern of Queensland's history as they are representative of a recurrent theme that involved most communities throughout the state. They provide evidence of an era of widespread Australian patriotism and nationalism, particularly during and following the First World War. The monuments manifest a unique documentary record and are demonstrative of popular taste in the inter-war period. Opened in 1921, the memorial bridge at Brooweena was erected as an enduring record of a major historical event. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. It is rare as the only known privately erected memorial bridge in Queensland and possibly in Australia. The use of a bridge as a memorial to the First World War is uncommon in Queensland. There is only one other known example, however, it was publicly erected. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. It is rare as the only known privately erected memorial bridge in Queensland and possibly in Australia. The use of a bridge as a memorial to the First World War is uncommon in Queensland. There is only one other known example, however, it was publicly erected. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Bridge has a strong and continuing association with the community as evidence of the impact of a major historic event. This memorial is of particular significance as evidence of the extraordinary patriotism of the people of Brooweena and specifically with the Smith family who were responsible for its construction.

It was built . It is also known as Price Property. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 28 April 2000.  History  The Allan Slab Hut at Doongul Creek, via Torbanlea is a basic, hand-built hardwood structure built sometime in the first decade of the twentieth century by Henry Price, an emigrant miner from Wales, as the home for his family. Henry Price arrived by ship in Maryborough sometime around the turn of the century and was followed some time later by his wife Esther Ann Price and her daughter Blodwen Comely Evans Price. It is believed that the family squatted on their small selection before formally selecting the land in 1913. The possibilities for self sufficiency offered by this selection of one hundred and sixty five acres and three roods, would have brought greater economic stability and autonomy than Esther Price had ever known. Illiterate and twice widowed by mining accidents in Wales, Esther married Henry Price in her middle age and emigrated to Australia with her daughter. Their lives were typical of poor migrants who came to Australia and eked out a living on small marginal selections. The slab hut was the first house the family had ever owned and Henry built it himself from hardwood felled, or already fallen, on the property, possibly ironbark or stringybark. Esther was a midwife and in Wales had lived in a tiny urban cottage with her brother and five lodgers. She had to acquire a range of new skills to deal with life in rural Queensland. She cooked outdoors at an uncovered hearth and worked five acres of market gardens to raise a small income. Her daughter, Blodwen married Archibald Allan, a miner from Howard in 1912 and raised her surviving five children on the property in a former school building, brought to the site from Upper Doongul sometime in the 1920s. A number of the children were born on the property with Esther in attendance as midwife. Archibald Allan travelled by bicycle to work ten- and twelve-hour days, six days a week in nearby coal mines to support the family after Henry Price's death. Esther and Blodwen sold vegetables in Howard to supplement his wages which were barely enough to feed the family and the sons hunted for wild birds to provide some protein in their diet. Esther was known in the district as a \\"wise woman\\", someone who would assist women in having their babies and it is likely that she traded her midwifery skills for other goods or services. Midwives, both trained and untrained, provided the primary care for birthing women in Queensland until the 1930s and homebirthing continued as a more common practice in rural areas than urban. The mines in the Torbanlea district were a source of opportunity for migrants and yet the conditions for miners were such that financial security was still difficult to attain. Coal was first discovered in the Burrum River region in 1863 and mining was well underway by the turn of the century. There were three producing mines - Burrum, Riverbank and Torbanlea, which in 1900 produced about one fifth of the Colony's total production. The Burrum Colliery run by Queensland Collieries Company Limited was by far the biggest operation in the district and was the stimulus for the founding of the town of Howard. The managing Rankin family had instituted a rule of \\"paternal despotism\\" and the fine house \\"Brooklyn\\" that the company built for them in Howard stands in stark contrast to the hand-built timber hut of the Allan family. The Burrum coal mines were the last to be unionised in Queensland, conditions were notoriously bad and average wages were a shilling a day. Miners were paid by the ton, used pick and shovel and were never certain that they would have work the next day. Mining was the only local source of employment and the mine operators dictated the terms of employment. A small number of favoured permanent miners were provided with a miner's hut, a four- roomed stringybark cottage, of which there were fourteen in Torbanlea. Families had an average of eleven children and whilst most miners usually had only one meal a day, they endeavoured to provide two meals a day for their children. In this context, the construction of the slab hut was something of an achievement. The building method is an improvised version of fencing construction techniques used to construct a basic dwelling of hardwood slabs nailed and wired to posts and rails. It demonstrates the family's need to make do with what they could find or afford, rather than reflecting a tradition of craftmanship or even bush carpentry. Many mining families in the district lived in dwellings constructed of posts, flattened kerosene tins and hessian sacks and strained economic circumstances meant that many families were not able to hold on to their selections. In fact, the Allan family property is now an isolated piece of freehold land within an area of former selections that reverted to Crown land when previous owners were unable to sustain a living. The resilience and tenacity that was necessary for the Allan and Price families to be able to hang on to their selection and indeed consolidate and develop it, is demonstrated by the length of time that the hut was used as a dwelling. Esther Price lived in the slab hut until she died in 1936. She planted a fig tree that now shelters the hut, which is situated amongst the remnant evidence of the orchards and market gardens that once surrounded it. Three other trees have been planted on the property to commemorate members of the family, two figs and a crow's ash. The slab hut has subsequently been used as a fowlhouse and for general storage and is currently not used.  Description  The Allan Slab Hut is a small structure, approximately three metres by four metres in plan, located on a property in the vicinity of Doongul Creek, west of Torbanlea. It has a simple rectangular form, a pitched roof and a lean-to addition on the northern side. A large fig tree is located to the north, along with remnants of former fences and hitching rails. The walls are constructed of vertical hardwood slabs that have been shaped with an axe or adze. The slabs have been dressed at the top and bottom to conform to a regular depth and are connected to top and bottom plates with either nails or lengths of twisted wire. Rails have been checked into round corner posts and there is also a central round post in each of the long sides of the hut. The floor is formed from ant-bed and although now covered with dust, is clearly discernible. An entry door is located on the eastern wall, it has a fanlight space above that is covered with corrugated iron. In the eastern end of the southern wall the slabs have been cut at about two-thirds height to form a long window-like opening. This has now been boarded up with horizontal boards. A galvanised, corrugated iron water tank is also situated against the southern wall. The corrugated iron sheeting and roof battens have been replaced, however, some of the roof structure consists of hewn rafters. The gable ends are infilled with horizontal timber boards. The lean-to on the northern side also appears to be more recent. It is roughly constructed of a mixture of round and hewn rafters. The plate supporting the roof structure has been simply nailed or wired to the slab wall and the other edge of the roof is supported by three large round timber posts. The western end of the lean-to space has been enclosed with horizontal sheets of corrugated iron and the northern wall is enclosed with chicken wire. An exterior hearth formed of a semi-circle of river stones located at the western end of the hut is now covered with dirt and can only be seen in times of heavy rain. Beyond the fig tree on the northern side is a small waterhole. The former orchard area lies beyond this, with a single Chinese Date tree surviving.

The street defines the southern boundary of Copenhagen's Latin Quarter. Most of the buildings in the street date from the years after the Copenhagen Fire of 1795. History The name Vestergade (\\"West Street\\") testifies Gammeltorv's original status as the most important square in Copenhagen. In the Middle Ages, Vestergade was Copenhagen's main street, linking the square with the Western City Gate at its western end. The north side of the street was lined with guesthouses. The city gate was moved a little further to the south in 1668 but Vestergade maintained its role as the principal entrance road for traffic coming from the west. The street was completely destroyed in the Copenhagen Fire of 1728 and again in the Fire of 1795. The courtyard of the inn \\"The Rose\\" at No. 4, painting by Theodor Philipsen In 1865, Vestergade was home to a total of 17 inns and guesthouses. The number then began to decline, both as a result of the decommissioning of the city's fortifications, the increased importance of the railway and the large and modern hotels that opened on Vester Voldgade in the 1880s. In 1877, nine inns were left in the street and in 1888 the number had dropped to seven: Sj√¶lland (\\"Zealand\\"), Rosen (\\"The Rose\\"), Vinhuset (\\"The Wine House\\"), Tre Hjorter (\\"Three Deer\\"), Garverg√•rden (\\"The Tannery\\"), Garderg√•rden (\\"The (Royal) Guards' House\\") and Kronen (\\"The Crown\\"). In 1894 the number was down to five and by 1929 only Tre Hjorter was left. Vestergade photographed by Johannes Hauerslev in 1909 Both in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s, it was proposed to widen the street and make it more straight but each time it was stopped by opposition from citizens and organisations. Notable buildings and structures Vestergade 8 DIS - Study Abroad in Scandinavia is based at No. 7. No. 12 is the former guesthouse Tre Hjorter (\\"Three Deer\\"). Garderg√•rden at No. 18 is another former guesthouse. It received its current name when it was rented out to the Royal Horse Guards . The complex had room for 77 and was replaced by the new Royal Horse Guards Barracks at Frederiksholms Kanal in 1792 when it had become too small. The buildings were then again used as a guesthouse until the late 19th century. 14-year-old Hans Christian Andersen stayed the first couple of weeks at Garderg√•rden when he first arrived in Copenhagen. The Metropol department store (Vestergade 9/Kattesundet 3/Frederiksberggade 16) was built in 1906-08 to design by Anton Rosen. In 1924, the Jugenstil building was converted into a theatre by Viggo Jacobsen and Albert Oppenheim. Painted shutter from Vestergade 5: A farmer smoking a clay pipe The C. W Obel House at No. 2 was built as a combined inn and brewery in 1797. The property was acquired by the C.W. Obel tobacco manufacturing company in 1937. The company commissioned Frits Schlegel to design a five- storey warehouse and office building in the courtyard. The company, now the investment company of the C. W. Obel Family Foundation, is still based in the building. No. 5, which is also from the 1790s, was built for another leading tobacco manufacturer, Christian Augustinus, whose company was later merged with C. W. Obel.

Following his uncle Sinibaldo's election as , Opizzo was appointed the Catholic Church's patriarch of Antioch (probably in 1247 and possibly serving as long as the fall of Antioch in 1268). Life Opizzo was born to the Fieschi, the Genovese dynasty of the counts of Lavagna, sometime in the first part of the 13th century.. His parentage is uncertain, although certain church records suggest his father was Tedisio Fieschi. His paternal uncle Sinibaldo was elected in 1243. In October 1245, Opizzo was dispatched to end the conflict between Eastern Pomerania and the Teutonic Order. The Latin patriarch of Antioch, Alberto Brescia Rezzato, died during the Council of Lyon and sometime before 22 July 1246 Pope Innocent named his nephew to succeed him. In October 1247, Opizzo was named apostolic delegate to the Seventh Crusade but he did not leave Genoa for the east until mid-1248. By then, he had secured papal approval of his authority over all bishops suffragan to the Greek patriarch of his city; upon arriving in Antioch, he excommunicated Euthymius, who was forced to flee. In late 1248, amid the Seventh Crusade, Opizzo requested help from the French king following raids by the Turcomans; Louis granted the bishop and his lord Bohemond 600 crossbowmen but no knights, out of \\"fear that the army might break up and that it would prove impossible to reassemble it at the scheduled time.\\" A papal letter of 7 November 1252 directed him to recognize that Prince Bohemond had reached the age of majority and no longer required the regency of his mother, Luciana Segni. Letters of 30 March 1254 granted him the church of Nicosia and‚Äîon account of the expenses occasioned by his visits to the Roman Curia where he was a professor of law‚Äîa portion of the income of the late bishop of Norwich and half the subsidies being directed to the aid of Antioch. He was at Acre in October 1254. Innocent IV's successor recognized Opizzo's continued service as papal legate in the region on 23 March 1255. When he was elected as patriarch of Jerusalem by its three canons, however, Alexander saw fit to quash the result, instead appointing the bishop of Verdun on the 9th of April. By the 17th of December, owing to the continued destruction within his territory, Opizzo was able to receive a promise to receive the first vacant position within the principalities of Antioch or Cyprus: this was made good by his receipt of the church of Limassol on Cyprus on February 21 of the next year. On 28 January 1256, the bishops of Tortosa and Tripoli were ordered to provide Opizzo with the funds previously deposited with the Templars and Hospitallers by On September 6, however, he was stripped of his jurisdiction over Nicosia. Under Alexander IV's successor , Opizzo received the income of the priory of St Lazarus of Tripoli on 13 January 1262. By 1264, Opizzo was being represented in Antioch by a vicar and he was apparently not present in the city when it fell with great bloodshed to Baibars, the sultan of Egypt, on 15 April 1268. Pope Nicholas III named him director of the church of Trani on 1 April 1288. Pope Nicholas IV named him administrator of the diocese of Genoa on 4 June 1288, causing him to surrender Trani by November 5. Supposedly, he supported the failed uprising on 1 January 1289; afterwards, he remained in his office but fled the city, daily administration being left to his vicar Bartolomeo da Reggio. He died in or shortly after 1291. Another one of Innocent's nephews, Ottobuono, served in various deaconries before his election as in 1276.

The large scale of public construction during the Flavian Dynasty (69-96 AD) led to the city being named Flavia Philippopolis. In 172, a second wall was built to encompass part of the city which had already extended out of the Three Hills into the valley, but leaving other parts outside. It became the provincial capital of Thrace in the early 3rd century. In about 250 the Battle of Philippopolis involved a long siege by the Goths led by their ruler Cniva and after betrayal by a disgruntled citizen who showed them where to scale the walls,Further Dexippus (2) By Christopher P Jones, https://www.academia.edu/11913736/Further_Dexippus_online_ the city was burnedhttp://archaeologyinbulgaria.com/2018/03/28/archaeologists-find-traces- of-251-ad-invasion-of-roman-empire-by-goths-during-digs-at-antiquity-odeon-in- bulgarias-plovdiv/ and 100,000 of its citizens died or were taken captive according to Ammianus Marcellinus. It prospered again in the 4th century like many cities in the region. However, it was destroyed again by Attila's Huns in 441‚Äì2 and by the Goths of Theodoric Strabo in 471.Roman Plovdiv: History Middle Ages During the Third Crusade, Frederick I camped in Philippopolis from 26 August to 5 November 1189.

Mateev, \\"–ñ–∞–Ω–µ—Ç 45\\", Plovdiv, 1999, Hellenistic period The initial planning and construction of Philippopolis started during Philip II's rule (359‚Äì336 BC) and continued during the reign of Alexander the Great and the Diadochi. Some authors assume that the first stage of the construction of Philippopolis ended around 500 BC. The town originally built on the hills was extended to the plain. Archaeologists confirmed that the Hippodamian plan was applied to Philippopolis as in other ancient towns like Miletus, Ephesus, Alexandria and Olynthus.Trakia, V.Velkov, Plovdiv, 1976 Hellenistic Philippopolis had a network of orthogonal gravel streets. Some of the streets had pavements, curbs and cambers to accommodate rain water drainage. The intersecting streets formed the rectangular city blocks (insulae) with residential and public buildings. A great number of public structures were built in Philippopolis such as theatre, stadium, agora, temples, thermae. The first city wall of Philippopolis was built as early as the 4th century BC and fragments of this fortification system are visible today on the northern and northwest slopes of Nebet Tepe. The wall was provided with small gates that led to passages or tunnels inside the rock through which steps reached the northern foot of the hill. Despite the unstable political and economic environment from the 4th century BC to the 1st century BC, large-scale urban planning and complex construction techniques were implemented in Philippopolis. The urban planning model from the Hellenistic period was strictly followed and developed after the city became part of the Roman empire. Roman period Forum Theatre Roman Odeon Southern gate Philippopolis Hellenistic and Roman walls Extensive renovation and large-scale construction took place after 46 AD in order to meet the growing needs of the population. A characteristic of the buildings in Roman Philippopolis was their large scale and lavish decoration which expressed the greatness and influence of the Roman Empire. The Romans continued the legacy left by the Greek architects of Philippopolis; the unit of measure used by the Romans (the Roman foot - 296 mm) coincided almost entirely with the Attica step used in the Hellenistic period thus allowing them to easily follow the initial urban planning model of the town without making significant alterations. In the Roman era the built-up area of Philippopolis in the plain totalled . It included around 150 insulae each with a width of 1 actus (35.5 m) and length of 2 actus (71 m). The existing street network was renovated and expanded with water supply and sewer system beneath it. The area of the road network amounted to 100,000 sq.m. The streets were paved with large granite slabs. The width of the streets was 15 Roman feet (4.4 m) while the width of the main streets reached 30 Roman feet (8.9 m). In the 2nd c. AD, the area north of the forum was enhanced and important public buildings from the Hellenistic period like the theatre, the stadium, the agora, treasury and odeon were rebuilt and expanded. In 172, according to an inscription found in the East Gate area from the reign of Emperor Marcus Aurelius, the city walls were strengthened and extended around the city in the plain in the areas to the east and west of the three hills, including, unusually, the stadium. Part of this wall can be seen today under Djumaya Square, next to the Stadium. However the wall was also built across part of the city lying to the south of the forum leaving many buildings outside the protection of the walls. Eventually this area became derelict and was used as a cemetery where early Christian tombs have been discovered.http://archaeologyinbulgaria.com/2019/07/12/30-year-old-roman- womans-grave-found-in-bulgarias-plovdiv-near-discovery-site-of-tomb-with- jesus-christ-murals/#more-13013 The odeon was built as a Hellenistic bouleterion, or council chamber, and underwent four reconstructions between the 1st and 4th centuries for use as a small theatre. Stadium excavations Evidence of the 250/1 destruction by the Goths has been discovered around the Odeon. After the Gothic invasions changes were made particularly noticeable in the East Gate complex, which had a triumphal arch in honour of Hadrian. The gate of the previous period was abandoned and a new route was added to the wall and the archway from the 2nd century was included. Recent excavations have revealed a 1st c. triumphal arch, only the 2nd in Bulgaria.http://archaeologyinbulgaria.com/2018/05/07/archaeologists-find-1st- century-ad-roman-triumphal-arch-from-ancient-philipopolis-in-bulgarias- plovdiv/ =Aqueducts= The Roman aqueduct on Komatevsko Shose The Roman aqueduct bridge in Plovdiv is the only one standing today in Bulgaria. Three aqueducts of 22 km length supplied mainly the lower part of the city, while the hills relied on wells and rainwater tanks. The aqueducts run parallel to each other in the neighbourhood of the suburb of Komatevo at separation of 30-40m, one a pipeline of clay pipes and two partially overhead aqueducts.Ivan Tsvarov: The Aqueducts in the Bulgarian Lands 2-4th c.

The source of the water supply network was three waterfalls on the slopes of the Rhodope Mountains, two in the Marata locality near today's village of and one in the Kaynitsite locality near the present town of Kuklen. The catchments at Markovo are well researched; one of them is an underground reservoir measuring 13 √ó 7 m, partially destroyed; the second is a complex tunnel system: a central gallery and side branches. It is not fully investigated, but the length of one of the lateral branches is 76 m. The distribution network in the city itself is located under the streets, with pipelines along all north-south streets, but only under a few in east-west directions. Street pipelines are built with clay pipes, with branches to separate houses and fountains with lead. The pipelines led to many public fountains and fountains which, although not found, are known from many sculptural fragments. The total water flow is estimated at around 43,000 cubic metres per day.

Description Eucalyptus socialis is a mallee that typically grows to a height of , but can reach as high as , and forms a lignotuber. The canopy is about wide. It usually has rough, grey bark on the trunk and smooth dull grey bark that is shed in long ribbons above. Young plants and coppice regrowth have stems that are square in cross-section and leaves that are dull green to greyish, egg- shaped to lance-shaped or elliptical, long and wide. Adult leaves are arranged alternately, the same dull green or greyish colour on both sides, lance- shaped, long and wide, tapering to a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of between seven and thirteen on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are oval to spindle-shaped, long and wide with a conical, beaked or horn- shaped operculum long. Flowering occurs in most months and the flowers are white to pale yellow. The fruit is a woody urn-shaped to shortened spherical capsule long and wide with the valves enclosed but with the remains of the style protruding but fragile. Taxonomy Eucalyptus socialis was first formally described by Friedrich Anton Wilhelm Miquel in 1856 in the journal Nederlandsch Kruidkundig Archief, from an unpublished description by Ferdinand von Mueller. The species name socialis a Latin word meaning \\"friendly\\", alluding to this species being associated with other eucalypt species as part of mallee communities. In 2005, Dean Nicolle described four subspecies of E. socialis and the names are accepted by the Australian Plant Census as at December 2019: * Eucalyptus socialis subsp. eucentrica (L.A.S.Johnson & K.D.Hill) D.Nicolle is distinguished from the other subspecies by the waxy coating on its branchlets and flower buds and by the dull bluish colour of its adult leaves; * Eucalyptus socialis F.Muell. ex Miq. subsp. socialis has smaller leaves, buds and fruit than the other subspecies and creamy white flowers; * Eucalyptus socialis subsp. victoriensis D.Nicolle has larger leaves, flower buds and fruit than the other subspecies and cream to pale yellow flowers; * Eucalyptus socialis subsp. viridans D.Nicolle is mainly distinguished by its green, rather than bluish green leaves. E. socialis and E. gillii have undergone extensive hybridisation in parts of the Barrier Range of New South Wales. Distribution It is one of the most widespread mallee species in Australia. In Western Australia it is found on calcareous flats and rocky scree slopes in the Pilbara and Goldfields-Esperance regions where it grows in red-grey loam over limestone. It is also found through much of South Australia, particularly in southern areas such as the Eyre Peninsula, Gawler Range, Flinders Ranges and Adelaide foothills where it is common. The range extends into the southern part of the Northern Territory, where it is found in the Alice Springs region and into parts of Queensland where it is found in open woodlands, where it often occurs with E. dumosa, E. gracilis and E. leptophylla. In New South Wales it is found west from Condoblin with a sporadic distribution from Wilcannia. In these areas it is found in mallee shrubland communities on red aeolian sands. In Victoria it is found in the north west of the state. Ecology Following bushfires the species can resprout basally and has a mortality rate of less than 30% when 100% of leaves are scorched. Uses E. socialis is suitable to produce large amounts of biomass, able to make per hectare per year. In wheatbelt regions it is also beneficial as the tree will reduce salinity, give shade to stock, act as a windbreak and reduce erosion. Traditional uses Indigenous Australians used the tree for making bowls and medicines from the leaves, shields and spears from the bark and obtained water from roots. Use in horticulture The plant is sold commercially and is noted for its ability to grow in poor soils. It is very attractive to bees and butterflies who use the nectar for food from spring to summer during flowering. It is drought- and salt-tolerant and will grow in full sun in well-drained soils. It is slow-growing but used in revegetation projects and as a small garden tree.

The division distinguished itself in the intense defensive fighting around the village of Ponyri during the Battle of Kursk. It was credited with the liberation of the town of Novozybkov on September 25, 1943. After battling its way through eastern Belarus during the autumn and winter of 1943‚Äì44, and then helping complete its liberation during Operation Bagration, it was moved to East Prussia, where it took part in the Battle of K√∂nigsberg in the spring of 1945, ending the war on the Baltic coast near the Zemland Peninsula. In the course of these campaigns the 307th compiled a battle record to rival a Guards unit (which it narrowly missed out on) but was nevertheless disbanded on the second-last day of 1945.  Formation  The division began organizing at Ivanovo in the Moscow Military District on July 12, 1941, and was at the front by the middle of the next month.

The division would remain in that Front, apart from one month, until March, 1943, and in that Army until July of the same year. During this entire period the division remained in the same general part of the front, between Voronezh and Tula-Oryol.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 70 When it first arrived at the front, the division operated as a separate formation, but by September 1 it had been subordinated to 45th Rifle Corps.David M. Glantz, Barbarossa Derailed, Vol. 2, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2012, pp. 116, 406 Gen. A.I. Yeryomenko, the Army commander, began ordering counterstrokes on August 27 against German forces of Second Panzer Group that had recently captured Starodub. Over the following weeks the rifle divisions of 13th Army launched numerous attacks with limited armor support against the German flank in what was clearly an uneven contest to try to disrupt the enemy armored drive south to encircle the Red Army forces defending Kiev. In these actions the 45th Rifle Corps made little progress while suffering significant losses, and on September 7 Yeryomenko wrote: 13th Army was too far south to be caught up in Operation Typhoon, but instead was gradually pushed eastward during October and November by the south flank forces of Army Group Center until it reached the area of Yelets. On November 5, Colonel Terentev handed command of the division to Col. Grigorii Semyonovich Lazko. After the German advance was halted at Moscow, Marshal S.K. Timoshenko led a counteroffensive by 3rd and 13th Armies against those same forces, driving them westward during December.Michael Jones, The Retreat: Hitler's First Defeat, John Murray (Publishers), London, 2009, pp. 142, 175 During 1942 the front in this sector was stable, with both sides committing their major forces elsewhere. This changed in the aftermath of Stalingrad. Soviet formations on the southern half of the front exploited the victory by thrusting westward, and on February 12, 1943, the 307th was pushing northwards from the area of Kursk in the general direction of Oryol, but a week later had been brought to a halt.Glantz, After Stalingrad, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2009, pp. 249, 270 As was the case with many other successful Red Army formations during this period, the division was considered for elevation to Guards status, but the following report from the chief of the 13th Army's political department dashed that chance: Even this scathing report did not prevent Lazko from being promoted to the rank of Major General on February 22. The division would miss out on the distinction of Guard status, but would compile a worthy record nevertheless, beginning with its next battle.  Battle of Kursk  The 307th's February advance came to a halt several kilometres north of the village of Ponyri. During the following months the division fortified its positions, first as a matter of course, then more intensively as Stavka began to expect a German summer offensive against the Kursk salient. Stavka was entirely correct.Robin Cross, The Battle of Kursk, Penguin Books, London, 1993, p. 91 In March, 13th Army was transferred to Gen K.K. Rokossovsky's Central Front. Just days before the battle began, General Lazko was replaced by Maj. Gen. Mikhail Yenshin, and the division became part of the second echelon of the 29th Rifle Corps.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 70 As the battle began on July 5, the 307th strongly contested elements of the German 9th Army, particularly the 9th and 18th Panzer Divisions, both in the village and Hill 253.5 on its outskirts in what was described as the \\"Stalingrad of the Kursk Salient\\". Counter-attacks by elements of the division were backed by the 129th Tank Brigade and the 1454th SU Regiment (SU-122s).Vasiliy Krysov, Panzer Destroyer, trans. V. Kroupnik, ed. Stuart Britton, Pen & Sword Books, Ltd., Barnsley, UK, 2010, p. 40 The highest ground was denied to the Germans by the 1023rd Rifle Regiment. Back- and-forth fighting went on for several days, and while the Soviet forces were not able to immediately retake the village, the German thrust had been stymied far short of its goal, with significant losses, giving the Red Army, and the 307th, the victory, also at a large cost.Cross, pp. 187‚Äì88. Note that Cross misnames the 1023rd Rifle Regiment as the 1032nd. The latter regiment was in the 293rd Rifle Division.  Advance  Following the German defeat at Kursk, Central Front began advancing westward out of the salient. On July 21, the 307th was transferred to the 70th Army, and about a month later to the 48th Army, moving to the 42nd Rifle Corps.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 70 During the Front's advance westwards towards the Dniepr the division distinguished itself in the liberation of the city of Novozybkov: Battles for Belarus By the start of October, Rokossovski's Front had arrived along the Sozh River, as well as part of the Dniepr south of the Sozh. His next objectives were the cities of Gomel and Rechitsa. The preliminary plan for the offensive called for 65th Army's 19th Rifle Corps to begin an attack against the German XXXV Army Corps' defenses at Gomel on October 7. Following a regrouping, 48th Army's 307th, 102nd and 194th Rifle Divisions would join the offensive as soon as possible, with the other four divisions of the Army to follow. This regrouping transferred the first three divisions into the bridgehead at Loev, (the confluence of the Dniepr and the Sozh) between October 8 and 14. Soon after this the 307th was moved to the 42nd Rifle Corps, which was in the first echelon on a 5-kilometre-wide sector between the village of Bushatin and the Dniepr.Glantz, Battle for Belorussia, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2016, pp. 103‚Äì04, 106, 175, 179 The Gomel-Rechitsa Offensive was launched from the Loev bridgehead early on November 10 on a front of 38 km. In three days of fighting the forces of 48th and 65th Armies managed to tear a gap 15-kilometres wide and from 8 ‚Äì 12-kilometres deep in the German defenses, and were halfway to Rechitsa. By November 16 the 307th had reached as far as Sviridovichi. Over the next four days, 42nd Corps drove XXXV Corps back into Rechitsa, and on November 20 the Germans evacuated the city, crossing to the east bank of the Dniepr under pressure from the rifle Corps and 1st Guards Tank Corps to the north. Army Group Center's southern defenses were in a state of crisis by this point, and Ninth Army had been forced out of Gomel. As the German retreat continued, 42nd Corps also crossed the Dniepr and linked up with the rest of 48th Army.Glantz, Battle for Belorussia, pp. 181‚Äì86, 200 In December the division was transferred to 29th Rifle Corps, still in 48th Army.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1944, p. 14 In January, Rokossovsky planned another offensive to continue his drive towards Parichi and, in the best case, Bobruisk. Beginning on January 16, 29th and 42nd Corps, along with a corps of 65th Army and backed by two separate tank regiments and the SU-76s of 1897th SU Regiment,Sharp, \\"Red Hammers\\", Soviet Self-Propelled Artillery and Lend Lease Armor 1941 ‚Äì 1945, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. XII, Nafziger, 1998, p. 91 were to attack on a 15-kilometre-wide sector from Shatsilki on the Berezina River southwestward to Zherd Station on the Shatsilki ‚Äì Kalinkovichi rail line. They faced the German 253rd Infantry Division and roughly half of the 36th Infantry Division. On the overall attack sector the Red Army had, with reserves, about a 3 to 1 advantage in infantry, but was weak in armor. The 307th was on the right of its Corps, east of Shatsilki. From the outset, the two Rifle Corps struggled to penetrate the German forward defenses. After six days of intense fighting, 48th Army's shock group managed to advance between five and ten kilometres on a front of roughly 20 km. Shatsilki fell to the 217th Rifle Division on January 21, and the rest of 29th Corps was regrouped and ordered to attack northward toward Chirkovichi and Molcha, 8‚Äì13 km northwest of Shatsilki, beginning on January 24.Glantz, Battle for Belorussia, pp. 482‚Äì86, 490 This renewed attack caught the Germans off-balance as they were preparing new defenses. In four more days of heavy fighting the 307th captured the German strongpoint at Repishche. Then, with flank support from the 73rd and 137th Rifle Divisions, it forced the 253rd Infantry to retreat with most of its remaining forces to the Chirka River. By day's end on January 27 the most advanced elements of 48th Army were just 15 km from the outskirts of Parichi. But this had come at a cost, and Rokossovsky called a temporary halt on that date, with the offensive to resume on February 2. The new effort made only limited gains in four days of combat, and another halt was called on February 6. On those last two days the division took in 1,500 infantry replacements from the Far East.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 70 Shortly thereafter the 307th was shifted to 25th Rifle Corps, which was holding the line along the Berezina. On February 24, following a short but intense artillery preparation, 25th Corps launched an attack across the river. The division was in the center on the Iashchitsy sector and almost immediately ran into enemy strongpoints at Dubrova and Antonovka which were only overcome after three days of hard fighting; the flanking divisions faced the same sort of difficulties. Early on the 26th the battle was reinforced by two divisions of 53rd Rifle Corps, specifically by 41st Rifle Division on the 307th's sector, and by the next day the strongpoints were taken and the German 45th Infantry Division was falling back to an intermediate line 4 ‚Äì 10 km to the rear. The 307th pursued towards Korotkovichi but bogged down there in the new German defenses. This offensive was halted on February 29 after an advance of from 2 ‚Äì 18 km on a 20 km front. This marked the end of Rokossovsky's winter offensives.Glantz, Battle for Belorussia, pp. 491‚Äì92, 499, 504, 517‚Äì21 In March the division was transferred to the 19th Rifle Corps of 50th Army,Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1944, p. 101 still in the 1st Belorussian Front, but in April the 50th Army was itself transferred to 2nd Belorussian Front in the buildup to Operation Bagration. From April until July the division was not assigned to any corps.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1944, pp. 131, 162, 192 On the third day of Bagration, Maj. Gen. Vasilii Nikitich Dalmatov took command of the division from General Yenshin, and would remain in that post for the duration of the war; at the same time, Yenshin took over Dalmatov's 362nd Rifle Division. On July 9 the 307th was released to 49th Army from Front reserve. It was tasked, along with 38th Rifle Corps and five other separate rifle divisions, plus three NKVD border regiments, to methodically comb through the forested areas east of Minsk with light air support. This was a search and destroy mission against enemy groups that had not yet surrendered. This operation ended on July 13,Soviet General Staff, Operation Bagration, ed. & trans. R.W. Harrision, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2016, Kindle ed., vol. 2, pt. 1, ch. 4 after which the division returned to 50th Army. The 307th would remain in 50th Army for the duration, for most of that time in the 81st Rifle Corps.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 70 On September 1 the division was recognized for its role in the Osovets Offensive with the award of the Order of Suvorov, 2nd Class. Into Germany In February, 1945, 50th Army was shifted to 3rd Belorussian Front as the war was grinding to a halt in East Prussia. The division would take part in the Siege of K√∂nigsberg, and would later join the Zemland Group of Forces, clearing the remaining German elements from the Baltic coast.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 70 On April 5, the day before the final battle for the city began, the division was awarded the Order of the Red Banner for the capture of Bia≈Ça Piska and other nearby towns, and its general record of service. On the same day, it was also awarded the Order of Kutuzov, 2nd degree, for its role in the capture of Wormditt, Melzak, and the surrounding area. When the war ended, the men and women of the division carried a title to rival most Guards divisions: 307th Rifle, Novozybkov, Order of the Red Banner, Order of Suvorov, Order of Kutuzov Division.

Overview Hazaribagh district is spread over a part of the Chota Nagpur Plateau. The central plateau, averaging a height of , occupies the central part of the district. On all sides, except on the western side, it is surrounded by the lower plateau, averaging a height of , the surface being undulating. In the north and the north-west the lower plateau forms a fairly level tableland till the ghats, when the height drops to about and slopes down gradually. The Damodar and the Barakar form the two main watersheds in the district. DVC has constructed the Konar Dam across the Konar River. It is a forested district with cultivation as the main occupation of the people. Coal is the main mineral found in this district. China clay is also found in this district. Inaugurating the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana in 2016, Raghubar Das, Chief Minister of Jharkhand, had indicated that there were 23 lakh BPL families in Jharkhand. There was a plan to bring the BPL proportion in the total population down to 35%. Maoist activities Right from its inception in 2000. Jharkhand was a ‚Äúlaboratory‚Äù for Naxalites to experiment with their ideas of establishing a parallel government. As of 2005, 16 of the 22 districts in the state, including Hazaribagh district, was transformed into a ‚Äúguerrilla zone‚Äù. The movement was not restricted to armed operations but included kangaroo courts called Jan adalats, elected village bodies and people's police. Jharkhand, with a dense forest cover over a large part of the state, offers a favourable terrain for the Naxalites to build their bases and operate. Annual fatalities in Jharkhand were 117 in 2003 and 150 in 2004. In 2013 Jharkhand was considered one of the two states in the country most affected by Left wing extremism and Jharkhand police set up an exclusive cell to deal with Maoist activities. However, in the same year, when Jharkhand police identified 13 focus areas for combating Maoist extremism, Hazaribagh district was not one of them.

It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 12 October 2002 but delisted in 2015.  History  SS Marloo SS Marloo was a steel steamer of 2628 tons owned by the Adelaide Steamship Company. Formerly the \\"Francesco Crispi\\", it was built at Newcastle upon Tyne, England in 1891. In September 1914, SS Marloo was steaming from Mackay to Brisbane when she hit a submerged danger on Sandy Cape Shoal off Fraser Island. She was taking on water fast, so the captain steered the ship and deliberately beached it on Fraser Island about north of Waddy Point on 27 September 1914. The crew and all 38 passengers were rescued. A subsequent enquiry found the ship's captain was at fault for not exercising sufficient care and attention in navigation in an area of known dangers. Most of the steamer's cargo was salvaged before a north-easterly gale frustrated attempts to refloat her and she soon went to pieces. The remains of the Marloo have been blasted to recover brass. Over the years, some of the wreckage became disassociated from the main wreck, which led to a listing on the Queensland Heritage Register in 2002 in an attempt to protect the disassociated wreckage. However, in 2015, it was delisted from the Queensland Heritage Register as the Australian Government's Shipwreck Act now provides adequate protection for the sites containing relics of shipwrecks.  Description  The wreck of the SS Marloo are located on the beach about northwest of Waddy Point on Fraser Island in about of water. The remains are located below the surface and are sometimes exposed due to tidal events and erosion. The remains were last exposed in October 2002.  Heritage listing  The SS Marloo was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 12 October 2002; it was declared by regulation of the Queensland Heritage Act 1992 (see Section 8 of the Queensland Heritage Regulation 2003) to be a protected area.

It is found in western North America ranging from California to Alaska, where it grows as a plant pathogen on conifer trees, particularly fir, spruce, and hemlock. Fruit bodies of the fungus comprise overlapping pore-bearing plates, measuring collectively up to wide, deep, and thick. Their color ranges from bright orange to salmon orange on the upper surface of the cap and stipe, with a yellow pore surface on the cap underside. Spores are egg-shaped, smooth, hyaline (translucent), and measure 6.5‚Äì8.0 by 4.0‚Äì5.0 Œºm. The species was described as new to science in 2001 by mycologists Harold H. Burdsall and Mark T. Banik. The type collection was made in Kenai Peninsula, Alaska, in October 1999. L. conifericola is distinguished from other Laetiporus species by its growth on conifers. Until its confirmation as a distinct species, it was frequently misidentified as the eastern North American species L. sulphureus, which grows on hardwoods. L. conifericola is generally considered edible, but some people have reported having gastrointestinal upset after consuming the fungus. Young specimens with soft flesh, or the fresh margins of older fruit bodies are best for eating, and thorough cooking is recommended.

History Bun towers During the mid-Qing Dynasty, a pandemic spread through villages in Cheung Chau and caused a lot of deaths. As a result, villagers decided to gather before Pak Tai and pray, and later on were instructed to set up altars and say mass to scare the evil spirits away. Afterwards, islanders built temples to show gratitude to Pak Tai's blessings, viewing him as the guardian of the village. As years went by, the annual Cheung Chau Bun Festival became a tradition. Villagers dressed up as gods to vanquish evil. The ping on bun was used to build the bun towers (three towers that stood 18 metres tall made of a huge number of buns) during the festival. Buns were to be distributed to the villagers after prayers and used to offer sacrifice to Gods and ghosts.‰ΩïËÄÄÁîüÔºå„ÄäÈ¶ôÊ∏ØÈ¢®‰øóÂèäÁØÄ‰ª§ÊñáÂåñ„Äã(È¶ôÊ∏ØÔºöÊòéÂ†±) 78-79 È†Å The villagers believed that eating hot ping on bun helps ward off disease, and that spreading powdered ping on buns in the sea can help to calm the ocean. Ingredients Ping on bun originated in Hong Kong. Its major ingredients include low-protein flour, lotus seed paste as well as sugar. It is best served hot or at room temperature. There are also some special flavours such as red and green bean. Cultural influence More than 48,000 tourists go to Cheung Chau during the bun festival. The distribution of ping on buns outside the Pak Tai Temple attract a hundred people queuing from the morning. Guo Jin Kee, a shop selling Ping On Bun, sold more than 10,000 Ping On Buns a day while there were long queues outside the shop in the morning. Tourists have to wait for half an hour to buy fresh Ping On Buns. Kwong Koon Wan, who earned more than $10,000 by selling a variety of ping on bun-themed souvenirs, said the bun cushions and fans were popular among tourists and expected that he could earn more than $30,000. Social issue =Food safety On 24 May 2015, Yee Ma Bakery on Sun Hing Street in Cheung Chau was found to sell ping on buns that contain the carcinogenic food dye ‚ÄòRed 2G‚Äô, which is a forbidden dye that cannot be used in the food producing process. The bakery was accused of violating the Food Safety Ordinance. Mr. Wan, owner of the shop, claimed that the same food dye was used for three years and the bun packages clearly list out the name as well as information of the agency and that the food dye is a legal product. Despite all the defences, they had no choice but to throw away hundreds of Ping On Buns, causing a large sum of material fees loss. Food waste As ping on bun is made by with fresh ingredients, it will spoil easily. During Cheung Chau Bun Festival 2015, nearly 10,000 buns spoiled. Because of the heavy rain and the hot weather, the buns of the three bun mountain became moldy and even caused some sour smell and odours. There are thousands of bun pieces left on the ground during the festival.I-cable.com.Retrieved 25 May, 2015 Originally, the Cheung Chau council managed to distribute all the buns of the bun mountains to the public. As the buns were spoilt, the Cheung Chau council obtained help from two bakeries and bought buns from all the bakeries from Cheung Chau directly in a bid to solving the problem. The representative of Cheung Chau bakery Kam Kwok said that the rising cost of making the bun such as the rent, the cost of ingredients, the cost of packaging etc. has increased. Therefore, the price of the bun increased from $6 to $7.

These backbone carbons are quaternary centers. As such, the cyclic side group lies perpendicular to the plane of the polymer chain, creating a looping structure. These rings are bulky structures which sterically hinder the polymers and prevent them from packing tightly. They also restrict the rotational range of motion of the polymer chain, creating a rigid backbone. As a result of their unique structures, these polymers have notably high thermal stability and solubility.Vasilii V. Korshak, Svetlana V. Vinogradova, Yacob S. Vygodskii: Cardo Polymers. In: Journal of Macromolecular Science, Part C: Polymer Reviews. 11, 1974, S. 45‚Äì142, There have been recent advances made in the applications of cardo polymers to membranes used for gas separation and transport.  Properties  Cardo polymers possess high thermal stability, (i.e., a high glass transition temperature), and high solubility. Rigid polymers with large segments have increased glass transition temperatures. The quaternary carbon and bulky ring structure of cardo polymers result in a highly rigid structure, since there are significant restraints on the rotational motion of the polymer bonds. Solubility generally increases with a decrease in rigidity. This is usually problematic because increasing solubility and increasing thermal stability are often in conflict with each other. However, the addition of a cardo group increases solubility because the bulky structure creates steric hindrance, preventing the polymer chain from packing tightly. This loose packing offers more surface area for the polymer to interact with the solvent, increasing the solubility. Polymers with more polar cardo groups are more soluble that those with less polar groups. Not only are interactions between polar components on the polymer backbone and the solvent occurring, but also interactions between polar components of the cardo group and the solvent. The net interactions are what give cardo polymers their high solubility.  Synthesis  The chemical structure of the repeat unit of a cardo aromatic polyester, with a bisphenol structure incorporated in the backbone The synthesis of cardo polymers utilizes the same techniques as most polymer synthesis. However, the bulky, and often non-polar cardo monomers do offer some challenges, requiring unique synthetic tactics.  Aromatic Polyesters  Cardo aromatic polyesters form a type of cardo polymer in which an ester group is incorporated in the backbone of the polymer chain and the ester groups are separated by an aromatic ring. A common form of cardo aromatic polyesters are ones in which bisphenol is incorporated into the monomers. These polymers can be synthesized via polycondensation. The hydroxyl groups coming off the bisphenol component of the monomers can react with acid chlorides, producing hydrochloric acid as a byproduct. This synthesis is commonly carried out via interfacial polycondensation. However, low temperature and high temperature solution polycondensation conditions are also used. High molecular weight cardo aromatic polyesters can also be achieved via low temperature, acceptor catalytic polycondensation methods. The structure of some monomers used to construct cardo aromatic polyamides  Aromatic Polyamides  Cardo aromatic polyamides have amides incorporated into the backbone, separated by aromatic rings. The aromatic diamines have a low basicity that provides additional challenges to synthesis. Notably, they cannot be synthesized via melt polycondensation. The diamines are not polar enough to dissolve in water, making interfacial polycondensation methods challenging; there has been success from 4‚Äô,4‚Äù -diphenyl phthalide dicarboxylic chloride and aliphatic diamines as the two phases of the solutions in where the polycondensation can occur at their interface. More commonly, these polymers are synthesized from low temperature solution polycondensation via a reaction with acid chlorides, producing hydrochloric acid as a byproduct. These reactions are done under basic conditions in aprotic solvents, often in the presence of an inorganic salt, such as calcium chloride, to increase solubility.  Polyimides  The two-step synthesis scheme for a cardo polyimide Polyimides are polymers made up of imide group is incorporated into the monomers, with the imide existing in the backbone of the chain. These can be synthesized by either a one-step route or a two-step route. The two-step route involves first reacting the diamine monomer with an acid chloride or carboxylic acid to form a polygamic acid. Heating the polygamic acid then results in cyclodehydration, forming the imide. Alternatively, the synthesis can be carried out in one step in which chain grown and ring closure happen simultaneously. This reaction occurs at high temperatures in organic solvents including cresol, nitrobenzene, benzonitrile, and sulfolane. The diamide is dissolved, and then dianhydrides are added to the solution before the temperature is raised. The reaction is raised to temperatures within the range of 100-200 degrees Celsius and quenched with methanol. This one step synthesis produces higher molecular weight polymer chains than the two step synthesis and is now the preferred method.  Application to gas transport  The only application of cardo polymers currently being investigated in great detail involves, the use of cardo polymers in the development of thin membranes for gas transport and separation. In general, as the amount of free volume in a material increases, the higher the gas permeability. Also, with increased rigidity of the polymer comes an increase in the gas selectivity. Cardo polymers have a great deal of free volume since their bulky structure prevents tight packing, and a rigid backbone since the rings restrict rotational motion. Thus, cardo polymers act as a highly permeable, yet selective membrane material. To further increase permeability, many of the cardo polymers produced for gas transport have additional large side groups, such as tert-butyl groups, increasing the free volume of the material. Intermolecular forces play a key role in finding a balance between high permeability and high permselectivity. Specifically, strong intermolecular attractions arising from hydrogen bonding greatly inhibit the mobility of segments of the polymer chains resulting in a rigid, densely packed structure relative to a cardo polymer with only minor intermolecular interactions. These tightly packed, rigid structures decrease the gas permeability of the polymers by restricting the rate at which the gas can diffuse through the membrane. However, this effect is much stronger on large gas molecules such as oxygen and nitrogen compared to small gas molecules. This effect results in an increased permselectivity where the membrane will restrict the transport of large gas molecule, favoring that of small gas molecules. These gas transport membranes must be ultra-thin and are most commonly obtained via a phase inversion process. This process requires the polymer to be soluble in organic solvents. The process worksby first dissolving the polymers in solution. The solution is then placed on a glass plate and the plate is submerged in a liquid coagulation medium. During the transfer process, some solvent evaporation occurs, but mostly on the surface of the membrane. This results in the region exposed to the air being more concentrated and forming a skin layer. The structure of these asymmetric membranes include a porous sub structure and a denser external skin structure. The high solubility of cardo polymers means these membranes can be easily produced.

They were built from 1866 to 1870. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 30 March 2001.  History  The twin timber lighthouses, and lightkeeper's residence at North Bluff, were constructed in 1866 to designs prepared by the Office of the Colonial Architect, Charles Tiffin. A second residence was constructed at Middle Bluff in 1868. Up until 10 December 1859, the colony of New South Wales extended as far north as Cape York Peninsula. In 1859, the new colony of Queensland acquired over of coastline which had few safety features in place, and became responsible for all navigation lights and harbours along this coastline. At the time the only lighthouse which existed was Cape Moreton Light at Cape Moreton by the New South Wales Government in 1857. By 1859, Maryborough, first settled in 1847, was already operating as a port of some importance. The main export was wool from the inland areas. Migrant ships were also coming into Maryborough. Ships coming into Maryborough had to enter through Hervey Bay, an area full of sandbanks, on which ships could easily become stranded. A channel, with a minimum of over five metres of water at low tide, ran down the middle of the Bay, past the east of Woody Island, along Fraser Island and into the Mary River. In 1862, the Queensland government had appointed a Portmaster, Commander George Poynter Heath and had passed the Marine Board Act 1862. GP Heath (1830‚Äì1921) was born at Hanworth, in Norfolk, England. Late in 1859 as a lieutenant, he applied for the government post of marine surveyor in the new colony of Queensland and was appointed. In his thirty-three tenure of office in what became the sub-department of harbours, lighthouses and pilots, Heath was responsible for supervising the opening of 13 new ports, establishing 33 lighthouses, 6 lightships and 150 small lights and marking the inner route of the Great Barrier Reef. In November 1887 he retired from public service because of ill health and later returned to England. In the two years following the establishment of the Marine Board Act 1862, due to a lack of funds to spend on marine safety, activity concentrated on dealing with pilots and harbour lights, The issue of coastal lights was not taken up until 25 May 1864, when Members of the Queensland Legislative Assembly moved that a Select Committee be appointed to inquiry into and report upon the state of the harbours and rivers in the colony. The Committee consisted of Messrs Arthur Macalister, John Douglas, Gordon Sandeman, Robert Cribb, Henry Challinor and Joshua Peter Bell and convened for the first time on 27 May 1864. The Committee widened the terms of reference to include the question of the necessity of additional lighthouses on the coast of Australia, within the colony of Queensland. In a \\"Notice to Mariners\\" in the Queensland Government Gazette, in 1865, mention was made of the Burrum River which formed part of Hervey Bay, and that, when property beaconed and buoyed, the river would be easy steamers and small craft to navigate. In the same year, orders were sent for two lights for Hervey's Bay, as Hervey Bay was then known. Towers for fourth order, fixed (non-flashing) lights on Woody Island were completed by contract in 1866 and the lanterns were placed and fixed by the pilot's boat crew in 1867. Bringing the lenses and holophotes down from Maryborough and getting them up into the lanterns and finally adjusting them, took around ten days. A call for tenders for the construction of lighthouses and a lightkeeper's cottage on Woody Island was advertised in the Maryborough Chronicle on 26 May 1866. Plans and specifications for the buildings were available in the Harbor Office in Maryborough. It is likely that the design for the lighthouses and the original lightkeeper's cottage at North Bluff was prepared by the Office of the Colonial Architect, Charles Tiffin. The Office prepared the specifications for the cottage at Middle Bluff two years later (1868). The plans were likely to have been overseen by Robert Ferguson. Ferguson was employed by Tiffin as a temporary foreman of works from 1864‚Äì1870, where, in 1867, wrote specifications for and oversaw construction of the lighthouses at Bustard Head and Sandy Cape. John Simpson was appointed as the first lightkeeper of Woody Island and the lighthouses became operational on 1 October 1867. The two lights were considered as one unit, twin lights that lined up with each other. In the Government Gazette in 1867, Portmaster, GP Heath described how the lights operated together in order to guide vessels through Hervey Bay: > When entering Hervey's Bay, steer so as to pass one or two miles of the > Fairway Buoy, until the two lights on Woody Island are visible, and a > brought into line. Steer with the lights in one ...until the two lights are > almost on the same level ... keep a look-out for the red buoy ... On > sighting the buoy, steer ... [directions given] ... for the red buoy off the > Woody Island Spit ... When the lights are seen to become red at the same > time, a vessel is about one-third of distance from the spit across the > channel ... From thence, steer to pass ... as usual ... until the high light > [Middle Bluff light] is obscured ... Steer SSW until the light again opens > out as a bright light ... from which a course must be ... shaped for the > river heads.. One of the lighthouse keepers' homes on Woody Island, circa 1906 Initially, a keeper's house was built at North Bluff. The main light was positioned south at Middle Bluff, however, keeper's quarters were not constructed at Middle Bluff until 1868. Both lights had signal masts and a storage shed was built on the beach at Middle Bluff, on the eastern side of the island, to store kerosene for the lighthouse along with other provisions. The lamps and burners were the first of that size and description ever constructed for petroleum oil, and burnt with great certainty and less variation of flame than other petroleum burners. The Portmaster was concerned, however, as to whether he was justified in having only one lightkeeper on the island, considering its nearness to Fraser Island. The lights were two nautical miles apart, over a bad road, and the keeper, while at one light, left his family unprotected near the other lighthouse. Also, in the case of sudden illness, there was no person able to light the distant light, which might have led to very serious results. The issue regarding the safety of the lightkeeper and his family was resolved in 1868, when an assistant lightkeeper was stationed at the upper lighthouse (North Bluff) and a house built nearby. The contract for the cottage for the assistant lightkeeper went to Messrs Pawson and Humberstone for ¬£127, and was built from drawings and specifications prepared by the Office of the Colonial Architect, Charles Tiffin. The telegraph line was completed to Woody Island about 1870, thus allowing the lightkeeper at the lower lights to communicate the approach of vessels from the northward, and the assistant, the approach of those from the southward. The Portmaster proposed a line of telegraph between Woody Island and Maryborough, not only on account of any accident which might happen to the lights or lightkeeper, and as an instalment of the line which must eventually be carried on to Sandy Cape when the lighthouse was established there, but as a consequence to vessels arriving in Hervey Bay, or passing through the Great Sandy Strait, and wishing to communicate with Maryborough or any other station without going the thirty miles up the river and back again unnecessarily. In 1870, the telegraph line was established and Woody Island was connected to the mainland and Maryborough. The line crossed underwater from Urangan and was carried on iron poles imported from England up to the Middle Bluff lighthouse. In 1903, the telegraph line was connected to the Sandy Cape Lightstation from the Middle Bluff light. The line was carried on iron poles down to the eastern shore of the Island to a point known as Jefferies Beach, where the cable again went underwater to Fraser Island. In 1871, Woody Island was listed as a reserve for the Queensland Acclimatisation Society. This reserve was in place until 1959. During their time of association on the Island, the Society introduced several pairs of rabbits in 1866. Rabbits remained on Woody Island until 1952 when myxomatosis was carried to the island via mosquitoes and the rabbit population was killed off. Also, in 1871, one of the lightkeepers, Mr Sheridan, introduced 200 coconut trees to Woody Island, of only one of which has survived. The first lightkeeper, John Simpson, remained at Woody Island until 1870, when he was transferred to the Sandy Cape Lightstation. Simpson's replacement was Peter Hardie, lightkeeper, who remained on Woody Island until 1897. In 1883, Hardie's daughter, Sarah May Hardie, died of lung congestion and was buried south of North Bluff. It is thought that a number of other unmarked graves are located in the area. During the period when the lighthouses were operational, Woody Island was predominantly cleared of vegetation, this enabled a clear view to the lights and the signal masts from the mainland. Today, regrowth covers much of Woody Island. The North Bluff light was converted to an unwatched automatic light on 21 June 1937 running on gas. The keeper was no longer employed but remained in the house. The North Bluff Lighthouse was closed on 17 June 1959, at the same time, the Middle Bluff Lighthouse was automated, running on gas. In April 1960, Woody Island was gazetted as a national park. The gazettal of Little Woody Island as a national park followed in February 1977. Following the automation of the Middle Bluff Lighthouse in 1959, the keepers' residences at Middle and North Bluff were demolished during the 1960s. In 1985, Middle Bluff Lighthouse was converted to solar power, only to be closed two years later in 1987. Some maintenance and conservation work has been undertaken in the last few years by the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service, particularly to the Middle Bluff Lighthouse. With reasonably easy access to Woody Island from nearby Hervey Bay, school and other tour groups are regular visitors to the island.  Description  Woody Island Falls within the Great Sandy approximately five kilometres due east of Urangan, between Fraser Island and the mainland. The island has an area of about 660 hectares of undulating terrain and is approximately eleven kilometres long by three kilometres wide. The island is heavily timbered with hardwood species. A central ridge divides the island, rising to about above sea level. The slope is easy on the landward or western side and falls steeply to seaward, culminating in an abrupt and discontinuous rocky escarpment towards the north which extends for about nine and a half kilometres. A small sandy beach is located towards the southern seaward point. The ground cover consists of sparse native grasses on two old lighthouse clearings and dune flats, with very little cover through the higher and timbered areas. The two lighthouse clearings are located at Middle Bluff and North Bluff. The lighthouses are no longer operational.  Middle Bluff Lighthouse and surrounding area  The Middle Bluff lighthouse is relatively intact. It has a hardwood timber frame clad with timber weatherboards. The lamp and prisms have been removed and the lamp room glass has been replaced with plastic. The second landing window has been replaced with an aluminium one, while the lower landing window has been removed and built over. A steel mesh grill has been installed in the lighthouse. Internally, a timber ladder leads from the lower section to the upper section, or lamp room, of the lighthouse. A smaller opening then leads to the deck of the lighthouse. The timber deck and iron railings are intact and in good condition. The position where the light was placed in the lamp room is also evident. The remains of the lightkeeper's residence are located a few metres to the north of the lighthouse. The residence was removed in the 1960s and the remains are predominantly timber boards. Some of the stone paving surrounding the keeper's residence is discernible to the east of the lighthouse, however, it is not particularly clear at ground level and is better viewed from the deck of the lighthouse.  North Bluff Lighthouse and surrounding area  The North Bluff lighthouse is in a more dilapidated state than the Middle Bluff light. Similar to the Middle Bluff lighthouse, the North Bluff light has a frame of timber hardwood. Much of the timber weatherboard cladding is coming away from the frame. Nothing remains of the lamp room. Most of the timber deck and iron railings are evident, particularly on the northern side of the lighthouse, though some of the railings have fallen to the ground. The lighthouse is surrounded by timber posts which were once part of a fence, constructed in the 1950s. The timber remains of the assistant lightkeeper's residence are located about four hundred metres to the south of the North Bluff light. Unlike the paving at the Middle Bluff light, the stone paving surrounding the position where the residence was located at North Bluff is very clear. The square position of the house is evident and the remains of a wood-fired stove remain. Glass, ceramic and other items found by the various tour groups, particularly school groups, have been placed in a large mound on the stone paving. About twenty metres to the south of the residence is a large mature tree near a brick-lined depression which housed toilet facilities.  Site of Signal Mast, North Bluff  The site of the Signal Mast is located to about up a slight incline to the west of the former residence site. The site is defined by a circular rock-lined area with the remains of the Signal Mast in the middle. The signal mast is no longer extant with only a circular metal base with the remains of a coat of black pitch in situ.  Rock-lined Track  The remains of the track are extant at Middle Bluff, the track, however, is not particularly clear. Following the path north the North Bluff lighthouse, the track becomes clearer. At one point, the track disappears and reappears further along. The rock-lined track runs for approximately four kilometres, apart from the section (of around one kilometre) where it disappears.  Telegraph Line  The remains of the telegraph line include the first line [1870] which ran along the western side of Woody Island to the mainland at Urangan and on to Maryborough and the second line [1903] which ran along the eastern side from Jeffries Beach across to Fraser Island and the Sandy Cape Lightstation. The remains include the cast iron poles, some with cross arms and glass insulators still intact.  Graves Site  The grave of Sarah May Hardie is located on the eastern side of Woody Island south of the North Bluff light. It is a concrete headstone with the words \\"SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF SARAH MAY HARDIE WHO DEPARTED THIS LIFE AUG. 8 1883 AGED 19 YEARS \\"KEPT\\",\\" engraved on it. It is surrounded by a recently constructed painted, timber, picket fence. The remains of the original fence are located near the grave. The original fence posts are timber with decorative, chamfered tops. A number of other unmarked graves are thought to be located in the same area as Sarah Hardie's grave. The exact location of these, however, is not clear. There are reputedly nine graves on Woody Island.  Gas Shed and Gas Pipeline  The kerosene shed is a single storey, timber framed shed, with a gable roof clad with recent corrugated, galvanised iron, with a skillion roof extension. At the rear [western] elevation, the building has a small, copper [painted white] piping. This piping was laid underground and extended up the ridge to the Middle Bluff lighthouse. The copper pipeline is still extant and visible is some places along the track leading to the Middle Bluff lighthouse. The pipeline is surrounded by square, fibro sheeting.  Heritage listing  The Woody Island Lighthouses were listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 30 March 2001 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Constructed in 1866, while not forming part of the major lighthouses constructed along the Queensland coast from the late 1860s to 1890, the Woody Island Lighthouses are significant in demonstrating Queensland's history, occupying an integral part in understanding the establishment of maritime navigational aids along the Queensland coast, and reflects the growth and development of Queensland after its separation from New South Wales. The site survives as an important illustration of the early industrial development of Queensland, and of the settlement of the Maryborough/Hervey Bay in particular, and the geographical importance of the area for maritime and communication purposes. The Woody Island Lighthouses and Ancillary Buildings Site is associated with Commander George Poynter Heath, the first Portmaster of Queensland (1862‚Äì1890), a significant figure in the development of the Queensland lighthouse service. Heath was responsible for supervising the opening of 13 new ports, establishing 33 lighthouses, 6 lightships and 150 small lights and marking the inner route through the Barrier Reef. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The Woody Island lighthouses are further significant as rare examples of twin lighthouses constructed along the Queensland coast. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history. With further archaeological and historical research and analysis, the place has the potential to reveal important information about Queensland's history and early maritime technology and to reveal further information about infrastructure and other grave sites associated with the lightstation and with the history of Woody Island. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Constructed using an octagonal, timber-framed tower clad with weatherboards, the Woody Island lighthouses are significant as early examples of this type of construction, typically found in Queensland. The use of timber framing (usually clad with iron) was even more frequent following the construction of the Lady Elliot Island Lighthouse in 1873. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The ambience of the lighthouses, including the ruins and the overgrown vegetation, combined with their distinctive positions on the Island, overlooking Hervey Bay, the Great Sandy Strait and neighbouring Fraser Island and Little Woody Island, creates a strong aesthetic appeal which has attracted public interest and has invited \\"exploration\\", for many years. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. For the Hervey Bay and Maryborough communities, the place has a strong association with their heritage. The Woody Island Lighthouses are especially significant for its strong association with the life of the lightkeepers, their families and maintenance and stores people, who contributed to the continuum of a system dedicated to the single aim of maintaining the navigational aids for a period of nearly 120 years.

Battle of Kursk  The north shoulder of the Kursk salient was defended by 13th Army of Gen. K.K. Rokossovsky's Central Front in the first line. On April 21, Rokossovsky was ordered by STAVKA to evacuate the civilian population from the frontal zone to a depth of 25 km, including Ponyri, so as to adapt the evacuated towns, villages and settlements for defense.Dr. Boris Sokolov, Marshal K.K. Rokossovsky, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2015, p. 242 The first attacks on Ponyri came from the air on the first morning of the battle. Rokossovsky had anticipated that the main German 9th Army attack would come straight down the rail line, but in fact it struck somewhat farther west, and he scrambled to get reserves into place.

It is found in cooler temperate areas of China and Japan, where it grows on logs and stumps of hardwood trees, especially oak. The fruit body of the fungus comprises large masses of overlapping reddish-orange caps with a cream-colored pore surface on the underside. Taxonomy The fungus was described as new to science in 2010 by Japanese mycologists Yuko Ota and Tsutomu Hattori. The type collection was made on Mount Kurikoma, in Miyagi Prefecture, Japan, where the fungus was found fruiting on a trunk of oak. Molecular analysis of DNA sequences confirmed that the taxon is a unique species within the genus Laetiporus. The specific epithet cremeiporus refers to the cream-colored pores on the cap underside. Description The fruit body of the fungus comprises overlapping light orange to reddish-orange fan- shaped plates that individually measure up to wide by long. Collectively, the entire fruit body can reach a size of or more. The color of the caps fades to pale brown in age. The pore surface on the cap underside are yellowish-white to cream colored initially, sometimes becoming pinkish in age. Pores are small, numbering two to four per millimeter; they are circular at first but become more angular as the fruit body matures.

The book examines the traditional role of stereotypes and their functions in the rhetoric of colonialism, offering a critical analysis of images of the \\"Good Indian\\"‚Äîminority figures who enforce the dominant group's norms. All of these, FitzGerald argues, are variations of Defoe's Carib character Friday from his 1719 novel Robinson Crusoe.

Powered by their own Unreal Engine 4, the game started pay-to-play early access in March 2016, and free-to-play access to its open beta started in February 2017. Epic Games shut down its servers on April 27, 2018. Gameplay Paragon was a third-person multiplayer online battle arena video game. The maps featured in the game were symmetrical, and bases were located at the two opposite ends of a map. Players were tasked with defeating the enemy team by destroying the core in their base. They had the ability to reach their opponents' bases through the three lanes featured in each map. Each lane was protected by defensive towers that protected the bases by attacking any incoming enemies that stood within its range automatically. Lanes consisted of two towers and an inhibitor; destroying all of these allowed a team to spawn more powerful minions in that lane and directly attack the enemy core. Between lanes were jungles, inside which players could find additional resources for their teams. Jungles were separated from lanes by fog walls that players could not see other players through. In a match, ten players were divided into two teams. Each player assumed control of a \\"Hero.\\" Each hero had their own basic attack and possessed a set of four abilities composed of active attacks or maneuvers or passive buffs that helped them or their teammates. Different heroes had different skills and weapons. For instance, TwinBlast, an offensive hero, primarily fires two pistols and throws grenades, while Muriel, a defensive hero, aids her allies with a shield. Heroes came in ranged and melee classes. Each hero had an ultimate ability; for example, ranged hero Murdock can fire a massive laser with infinite range. Both teams had minions, which jog toward their opponents' bases and support the heroes. Super Minions entered the lanes upon destroying the enemy inhibitors. When players killed an enemy hero or minion or destroy an enemy tower, they gained experience and gold. Experience allowed players to level up and unlock or upgrade abilities. Just before a match started, players could choose a deck of cards that allows players to use gold to purchase upgrades such as health boosts and strength-enhancing artifacts for their heroes. Players could use a default deck or build their own when not playing a match. Cards and decks were divided into five different affinities. Each deck had two affinities, and had to contain cards with either of those affinities. Chests (loot boxes), which contained cards, could be earned through rewards from completing matches. Players could also use real- world currency to boost their reputation points and experience points. According to Epic, the game was not pay-to-win. As a result, players may only purchase cosmetic items with real-world currency or coins found within loot chests. The game also featured a replay system, which allowed players to spectate matches. The game regularly added new heroes and edited the main battle map through updates. Development Paragon was in development at Epic Games. According to executive producer John Wasilczyk, the team was given the chance to \\"make anything\\" and had a lot of creative freedom when they started the project. One of the main goals for developing the game was to introduce action elements into the genre. To achieve this, the game features gameplay similar to a third-person shooter, and the in-game characters were designed to possess mobility skills. For example, characters like Khaimera have the ability to leap and strike while Kallari possesses the ability to do a double backflip. The team also focused on verticality while developing the game's maps, which allowed them to turn the moments shown in MOBA CGI's trailers into an actual gameplay experience. According to Steve Superville, the game's creative director, the maps were designed to \\"[shape] like a bowl\\" so that players can look across the map easily when they respawn, observe the battle situation and plan their attacks strategically. The card system was designed to make the game more accessible for new players, simplify the traditional item system, and create more strategic choices. According to Epic, it is a feature that can help the game to differentiate itself from its competitors. Epic also transferred some of the resources for making Fortnite to Paragons development. Esports were under consideration, with Wasilczyk saying that it would depend on the demand of the community and the game's popularity. Paragon was set to be a non-boxed game released by Epic. According to Superville, the team were excited about the change as this format allows them to receive responses from the community and make adjustments immediately. The game was announced on November 3, 2015, and the first gameplay trailer debuted at PlayStation Experience 2015. The game entered early access on March 18, 2016, for PlayStation 4 and Microsoft Windows, with cross-platform play common in most matches. While the product was free-to-play, payment was required for early access to the game before the open beta release on August 16, 2016. The early access version of the game had three versions: Founder's Pack, Challenger Packs, and Master Packs, all of which featured cosmetic items, additional boosts, and upgrades. At the start of the early access version, the game contained thirteen characters. Epic promised that new characters would be added to the game for free one by one every three weeks and that they did not fix the roster size. A retail PS4 version titled Essentials Edition, which adds multiple in-game items, was also set to be released alongside the game's digital free-to-play version, and released on June 7, 2016. Upon release of Epic's Fortnites \\"Battle Royale\\" mode in late 2017, Epic decided to reduce the development team supporting the game in favor of Fortnite, as Paragon's limited growth did not meet expectations. Ultimately, in January 2018, Epic announced they would be closing down Paragon by April of that year, providing full refunds to all players. Following the cancellation of Paragon on March 19, 2018, developer Epic Games, and the owner of Unreal Engine, announced that it would release all $17,000,000 worth of game assets for free use by anyone working with the Unreal Engine 4, via the Unreal Engine Marketplace. The first wave of released content included 20 characters, with their respective skins, animations, VFX and dialogue, along with over 1,500 environment components.

It is kind of Maqtal al-Husayn (Arabic: ŸÖŸÇÿ™ŸÑ ÿßŸÑÿ≠ÿ≥ŸäŸÜ), narrating the Battle of Karbala, the death of Husayn ibn Ali, and subsequent events.  Title  The root of Lohoof is Lahaf (Arabic: ŸÑŸáŸÅ), which means \\"sighs of sorrow\\".  Author  Radhi ud-Deen Ali ibn Musa ibn Tawus (1193‚Äì1266 AD), often called Sayyed Ibn Tawus (Arabic: ÿ≥€åÿØ ÿßÿ®ŸÜ ÿ∑ÿßŸàŸàÿ≥), was a Shia jurist, theologian and historian. He was descended from Hasan ibn Ali through his father and from Husayn ibn Ali through his mother. It is said that he met the twelfth Shia Imam, Muhammad al-Mahdi (869‚Äì941), who, according to Shia belief, was or is living in occultation. Ibn Tawus is known for his library and his numerous works, which are still available in their original form and are considered good sources for learning about the concerns and teachings of Muslim scholars at the end of the Abbasid era.  Background  Sayyed Ibn Tawus had authored the book titled Mesbah-u-Zaer (Arabic: ŸÖÿµÿ®ÿßÿ≠ ÿßŸÑÿ≤ÿß€åÿ±) about pilgrims (Arabic: ÿ≤€åÿßÿ±ÿ™) to the holy shrine of Muhammad, prophet of Islam, and the twelve Imams. After a while, ibn Tawus decided to write a biographical essay about Husayn ibn Ali, the Battle of Karbala and its immediate aftermath; he named this essay \\"Lohoof\\". The essential information was collected in this book.  Context  Lohoof includes sections on Husayn ibn Ali, the Battle of Karbala, and its aftermath, in three parts: # The events that occurred just before the day of Ashura (10th of Muharram of 61 AH); # The events that occurred in the evening before Ashura, and during the day of Ashura; # The events that occurred after the day of Ashura, with regard to Husayn ibn Ali, his family, and his enemies. In the preface to the book we see this statement: \\"The importance of books such as Lohoof lies in its right, just, and authentic references and accurate narrations, which reveal the history of the 14th century.\\"  Sources used  The following sources were used by ibn Tawus in the writing of Lohoof: * Iqab al-a'mal of Ibn Babawayh * The reasons for Imamah of Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari. Several sources that ibn Tawus did not explicitly name but apparently used are: * Kitab al-fotuh of Ahmad ibn A'tham * Maqtal al-Husayn of Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi * Amali of Ahmed ibn Ibrahim Hasani Zaydi * Al-Irshad of Al-Shaykh Al-Mufid  Reception  Anyone who has written about the killing of Husayn ibn Ali has most certainly consulted Lohoof, which are actually adventures narrated by Sayyed ibn Tawus. In Lohoof, ibn Tawus writes about the most important events of the Battle of Karbala, such as the decision to return the captured family of Muhammad, prophet of Islam, to Karbala on Arba'een. Sayyed ibn Tawus collected some texts about the killing of Husayn ibn Ali. He emphasized that Husayn ibn Ali was aware of his killing at Karbala. The following statement had been included in most versions of Lohoof: \\"Certainly Allah had wanted to see him killed and women captured\\".

The vehicle, derived from the Hermes spacecraft developed by the European Space Agency, was planned to be built, launched, and operated by Swiss Space Systems. The spaceplane was planned to launch from an Airbus A300 aircraft named S3 Zero Gravity Airliner. Once at altitude, the spaceplane was planned to separate from the aircraft and ignite an NK-39 engine developed by the Russian Federal Space Agency. After fuel depletion at about 80 kilometers altitude, the plane was planned to release its payload before gliding back and landing on Earth. The launch vehicle was planned to also have low Earth orbit capability when launched in conjunction with an expendable upper stage. Swiss Space Systems has contracted the Russian firm RKK Energia to develop the upper stage. With an upper stage, the spacecraft was planned to be able to launch a 250 kilogram payload into orbit. Swiss Space Systems claimed that the spaceplane could cost about one fourth than current suborbital launch costs. The spaceplane was notionally targeted to have its first test launch by 2017. However, following financial trouble, the company was declared bankrupt in a Swiss civil court, ending its operations.  Development  Swiss Space Systems announced in 2015 that the airplane was planned to begin test flights in 2016. Additionally, by Spring 2016 the company plans to begin drop testing of the spaceplane, which would include dropping a scaled-down boilerplate spacecraft which would autonomously land in an airport. As of September 2014, test firings of the engine were expected to begin in late 2015. The company also partnered with Bauman Moscow State Technical University in 2013. According to Explore Deep Space, this partnership was planned to \\"enable the exchange of academicals between Russia and Switzerland\\".  Missions = Formerly planned  *CleanSpace One, a 30 kilogram satellite designed to demonstrate technologies for space junk removal.  Completed  No missions of the spaceplane were completed.  Future plans = Human spaceflight  In 2013, Swiss Space Systems declared their intention to eventually upgrade the spaceplane for human spaceflight. The company also announced a partnership with Thales Alenia Space for the design and construction of a pressurized compartment for the spaceplane's occupants. The company announced its intention to use a derivative of SOAR as a new high-speed passenger transport system instead of a space tourism vehicle. According to Pascal Jaussi, CEO of the corporation, \\"Far from wishing to launch into the space tourism market, we want rather to establish a new mode of air travel based on our satellite launch model that was planned to allow spaceports on different continents to be reached in an hour.\\"  Expansion  The company created multiple subsidiaries to support a network of launch and landing sites, with locations in the United States, United Arab Emirates, and Croatia. A subsidiary of the company, S3 USA Operations Inc, was formed in early 2014. The company planned to use the retired Space Shuttle landing site at Kennedy Space Center for the operation of SOAR. In 2015, Swiss Space Systems announced a partnership with the financial institution D&B; Group to create a joint subsidiary named S3 Middle East. This partnership, according to Satellite Today, was planned to allow the company to attempt SOAR launch certification in the United Arab Emirates. In March 2016 Amin Forati opened a bank guarantee of US$30 million in favour of S3 through his company D&B; Groups, but such a large sum failed to save S3 from bankruptcy. Forati in September fled Dubai and in November two criminal cases for fraud were opened in UAE against him.

He is one of the best-known composers outside of Haiti. Biography Justin Elie was born in Cap-Ha√Øtien. He studied piano with Ermine Faubert from 1889 to 1894 and he joined the Institution Saint-Louis de Gonzague in Port-au-Prince in 1894. In 1895, he migrated to France and enrolled at the Cours Masset, a preparatory school for the Conservatoire de Paris in Paris. He meets Antoine Fran√ßois Marmontel before his death in 1898. In 1901, Justin Elie was admitted to the Conservatoire de Paris. He studied with Charles-Wilfrid de B√©riot for piano, √âmile Pessard for harmony, and Paul Vidal for the musical composition. Return to the Americas In 1905 he returned to Haiti, where he met his colleague Ludovic Lamothe, composer and musician like himself, with which he will play and make a tour of major cities. Latin America In 1909 and 1910, he toured Latin America and has given recitals in many of the islands Caribbean (Cuba, Cura√ßao, Jamaica, Puerto Rico, Saint Thomas) and South America (Venezuela). In 1916, he also recorded his own Dance Tropical\\" on Piano roll for the Aeolian Company of New York's Duo-Art system. Like Ludovic Lamothe, Justin Elie was reintroducing the m√©ringue. It became a national symbol and a form of resistance to the US occupation, the country suffered since 1915. Ludovic Lamothe drew from African roots to express the meringue, while Justin Elie instead turned to the Amerindian past of Saint-Domingue. He composed several m√©ringues: Le Chant du Barde Indien et La Mort de l'Indien (Song of the Indian bard and The Death of the Indian). In 1920, he composed M√©ringue Populaire. The influence of Vodou is also present in the Elie's compositions, such as in Cl√©op√¢tre, poetry drama set in four arrays. United States On 12 September 1922, Elie left Haiti for the United States and settled in New York. He contacted the publishers of music and publish new partitions, such as L√©gende Cr√©ole, Pri√®re du soir, Invocation No. 2; Ismao-o !; Les Chants de la montagne No. 1; Nostalgie: Les Chants de la montagne No. 2; Nocturne: Les Chants de la montagne No. 3; Kiskeya. Elie's adaptations of Haitian melodies into miniatures led him to various performances in international concert venues, notably in the Carnegie Hall where he performed with his duet dancer called Hasoutra in 1923. In 1925, he composed the frames of silent films, including The Phantom of the Opera (Somers), and in 1931, the generic of a New York radio show, The Lure of the Tropics. Deaths Elie died suddenly of a cerebral hemorrhage on 3 December 1931 when he was composing Fantaisie Tropicale in New York City. His body was returned to Haiti. Notable works *Suite Babylon: 1.

There have been numerous examples found on sites of the Roman Empire, including taverns and houses, as well as on pottery of the time. In many cases the graffiti tend toward the rude, with a line etched into the basilica in Pompeii reading \\"Lucilla made money from her body,\\" phallic images, as well as erotic pictures. Studying the graffiti left behind from the Roman Period can give a better understanding of the daily life and attitudes of the Roman people with conclusions drawn about how everyday Romans talked, where they spent their time, and their interactions within those spaces. Graffiti samples Inscriptions cover a range of topics from poems, advertisements, political statements, to greetings. There are two forms of graffiti: painted inscriptions (usually public notices) and inscribed inscriptions (spontaneous messages). Pompeii Over 11,000 graffiti samples have been uncovered in the excavations of Pompeii. Archaeologists have been studying and recording graffiti in Pompeii since the 1800s. These documentations remain the best evidence of over 90 percent of recorded graffiti from the area, which has not survived the elements.Ohlson, Kristin. \\"Reading the Writing on Pompeii's Walls.\\" Smithsonian, 26 July 2010. Web. 3 Nov. 2015. =House of Maius Castricius= Sample of poetry from stairwell of House of Maius Castricius, Pompeii This domestic residence shows that ancient graffiti was not limited to the public sphere, as graffiti is in modern day. This site, discovered in the 1960s, has benefited from preservation efforts, leaving the graffiti samples in their original context and remain legible. There is a unique feature of eleven graffiti containing multiple lines of poetry. For the most part, the poems are arranged vertically and respect the space of the others. This mix of original work and common phases are not a miscellaneous group because of the number and composition; instead, it appears that a conversation has formed.Benefiel, Rebecca R. \\"Dialogues of Ancient Graffiti in the House of Maius Castricius in Pompeii.\\" American Journal of Archaeology 114.1 (2010): 59-101. Web. 3 Nov. 2015. One passage on the staircase reads: > vasia quae rapui, quaeris formosa puella accipe quae rapui non ego solus; > ama. quisquis amat valeat Which translates to: > Beautiful girl, you seek the kisses that I stole. Receive what I was not > alone in taking; love. Whoever loves, may she fare well. =Outside the shop of Fabius Ululitremulus= Three inscriptions referring to the opening line of the Aeneid An example here demonstrates a familiarity with Virgil and hexameter verse. On the doorpost of the shop near pictures of Aeneas and Romulus is written: > Fullones ululamque cano, non arma virumque. Translating to: > I sing of cloth-launderers and an owl, not arms and a man. The owl is a signifier of Minerva, the goddess who has been said to be protector over the profession of fullones. Mary Beard notes that there are more than fifty examples of graffiti referring to Virgil in Pompeii alone, but also notes that the majority of the references are to the opening lines of Book 1 or Book 2 of the Aeneid, suggesting that these lines may have been widely known in the fashion \\"To be, or not to be\\" is known today. Dialogues Inscription diaologue Graffiti is often meant to be seen and expects to be read. A dialogue is formed between the reader and the inscription and can be simple as they speak directly to the readers in forms such as \\"if anyone sits here, let him read this before everything else‚Ä¶\\" as well as \\"He who writes this is in love‚Ä¶ and I who reads this am a prick.\\" There are also dialogues where one passage answers another. These responses take the forms of greetings, insults, prayers, etc. > Successus textor amat coponiaes ancilla(m) nomine Hiredem quae quidem illum > non curat sed ille rogat illa com(m)iseretur scribit rivalis vale Translates to: > Successus the weaver is in love with the slave of the Innkeeper, whose name > is Iris. She doesn't care about him at all, but he asks that she take pity > on him. A rival wrote this A response to this translates to: > You're so jealous you're bursting. Don't tear down someone more handsome‚Äï a > guy who could beat you up and who is good-looking. Games and riddles Word squares (magic square) and riddles are also common forms of the culture of graffiti. These show a level of mental agility and flexibility of language.Benefiel, Rebecca R. \\"Magic Squares, Alphabet Jumbles, Riddles and More: The Culture of Word-Games among the Graffiti of Pompeii.\\" The Muse at Play. Vol. 305. Berlin, Boston: De Gruyter, 2012. 65-80. Web. 4 Nov. 2015. Children Examples of handwritten alphabets are common graffiti in Pompeii and could be evidence of children practicing their alphabet. This lends to the argument that children were responsible for much of the graffiti. However, the height of the inscriptions and location may contradict this. Commentary Writing around 100 AD, Plutarch wrote of graffiti: \\"There is nothing written in them which is either useful or pleasing ‚Äì only so-and-so 'remembers' so-and-so, and 'wishes him the best', and is 'the best of his friends', and many things full of such ridiculousness\\". 21st- century scholars have found more to study and enjoy in the visual art and intertextuality of Roman graffiti. More than simply text and thought, Roman graffiti give insight into the use of space and how people interacted within it. Studying the motivation behind the marks reveals a trend for the graffiti to be located where people spend time and pass most frequently as they move through a space. Common places for graffiti are staircases, central peristyle, and vestibule. The use of graffiti by Romans has been said to be very different from the defacing trends of modern day, with the text blending into the walls and rooms by respecting the frescoes and decoration with the use of small letters. In this way, the environment influences the graffiti by subject and organization, and the graffiti in turn changes and influences the environment. Studying graffiti Typical techniques when studying graffiti include drawing each inscription and taking photographs if special attention is required. When only a shadow of the engravings are visible to the naked eye, other methods of observance are needed to decipher the engravings. 3D laser profilometry Using 3D laser profilometry to analyze the roughness of a surface, archaeologists have been able to determine the tools used in engraving. This technique merged with photographs taken with oblique light, different lighting conditions, and results from electrostatic detection devices have increased the readability of illegible inscriptions.Montani, Isabelle, et al. \\"Analysis of Roman Pottery Graffiti by High Resolution Capture and 3D Laser Profilometry.\\" Journal of Archaeological Science 39.11 (2012): 3349.Web See also * Lupanar (Pompeii) * Alexamenos graffito * Memes References Graffiti and unauthorised signage Ancient Roman art Latin inscriptions Textual scholarship ","title":"Roman graffiti"},{"id":"48457403","text":"Laetiporus huroniensis is a species of polypore fungus in the family Fomitopsidaceae.

Club History  Cricket at Aligarh Muslim University started in 1878 when the mathematics professor, Rama Shankar Mishra, founded a cricket club, whose members were expected to wear a uniform of blue flannel coat, shirt, knickerbockers and cap. The club didn't at first thrive. It was not till Theodore Beck arrived in 1883 that real interest in cricket and sports began. The club toured Simla, Patiala and Bombay and performed very well. In 1884 Theodore Beck took the club on a tour round the Punjab including a match against Government College, Lahore. When Indian team toured England in 1922, three players came from Aligarh. In the year 1903 Oxford University Authentics visited India and played a two-day match at Aligarh. The match ended in a draw. On 18 & 19 February 1927 the club played a first-class match against Marylebone Cricket Club at Willingdon Cricket Ground, Aligarh and lost. Nazir Ali also played for the club. Aligarh Eleven won two consecutive matches against the Parsees cricket team. These two matches were held at Aligarh under the captainship of Khwaja M. Abdullah of Jalandhar.

This match was against the team of His Highness Maharaja Bhupinder Singh of Patiala. His Highness's team included J. T. Hearne (Middlesex) and W. Brockwell (Surrey). His Highness Maharajadhiraj Sir Bhupendra Singh, ruler of the erstwhile Patiala State, used to bring Patiala, British players of fame to play with and to coach his team players. He invited in his team J. T. Hearne (Middlesex), W. Brockwell (Surrey), C. B. Fry and Frank Tarrant.

Indies Empire style (Dutch: Indisch Rijksstijl) is an architectural style that flourished in the colonial Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia) between the middle of the 18th century and the end of the 19th century. The style is an imitation of neoclassical Empire Style which was popular in mid-19th-century France. Conformed to the tropical setting of Indonesia, the style became known in the Dutch East Indies as Indies Empire style. History=Rise of the Indies Empire style The development of the Indies Empire style is strongly related with the Indies culture, a society of mixed descendants which developed in the Dutch East Indies. Indies people associated themselves with high status and expressed themselves by building opulent country houses usually associated with European aristocrats. Many of these country houses appeared in the periphery of Batavia around the middle of 17th-century, the architectural style of which reached its peak when it merged completely with the Javanese local architecture, a new style known as the Old Indies style. With the arrival of Herman Willem Daendels in early 19th-century, the development of the architectural style of these country houses took a different course. Daendels was a former colonel- general of Louis Bonaparte from France. At that time, a neoclassical architectural movement named Empire Style was popular in France. When Daendels was made the Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies, he made Empire Style popular in the Dutch East Indies. Conformed with the tropical architecture of Indonesia, the style became known as the Indies Empire Style. Textile Museum in Jakarta, an example of a later period of Indies Empire style with the additions of corrugated steel shades. By the end of 19th-century, clubhouses and playhouses were built in big cities of the Indies such as Batavia, Semarang and Surabaya; most were built following the Indies Empire style trend. City development at the end of 19th-century also influenced the form of Indies Empire style. The lack of available space in city centers required modification of typical Indies Empire styled houses. Stone columns were replaced with wooden or narrow iron columns, usually imported from the Netherlands. Also changing was the additions of corrugated steel shades supported by cast iron consoles to protect the windows and the front porch from rainwater and sun. Examples of Indies Empire style houses from this later period are the Jakarta Textile Museum and some houses in Jalan Bubutan, Surabaya. In the 19th century, the Indies Empire style is considered a representative of the \\"uptown\\" of Batavia, the area south of the \\"downtown\\" Kota Tua. Indies Empire Style is described as a trend in which houses were built in \\"...one storey with large gardens, with front and back galleries and high and wide halls; houses with hanging roofs where shade, air and coolness were the dominant privileges...\\", compared with the earlier Dutch style houses in Kota Tua, described as houses with \\"...high dark rooms with the beamed ceilings, the white painted walls and the red tiled floors.\\" Decline Indies Empire style flourished until early 20th century, when the style was met with criticism. Indies Empire style in Indonesia was not a work of a professional architect, but a design of the building supervisor (opzichter). Modern academics such as architects Berlage and Moojen considered the Indies Empire style buildings to be low in quality; which led to a renaissance of architectural style which sought a new unique identity specially attributed to the culture of Dutch Indies. Later a new style emerged, known as the New Indies Style, a modern movement and a branch of Dutch Rationalism which at the end replaced the Indies Empire style. Characteristics Istana Merdeka, a typical residential building in early Indies Empire style. Indies Empire style is essentially Empire Style conformed into the tropical setting of the Dutch East Indies. Similar with the Empire Style, Indies Empire Style made an eclectic use of antique motifs ‚Äì usually Greco-Roman ‚Äì to imitate an imperial colonial dynasty. Few buildings in the Indies make reference to the Gothic style e.g. the residence of Raden Saleh. Layout is symmetrical, with high ceiling, thick walls, and marble floor. Buildings often have a front (voorgalerij) and rear gallery (achtergalerij), flanked with Greek columns. This front and rear porticos are very spacious compared with its original European-style to improve cross ventilation into the interior as well as protecting it from intense tropical heat and rain ‚Äì a European attempt to imitate the local pringgitan, a Javanese veranda with a bamboo bench where people may sleep during a hot noon. Furniture may be placed in the portico. An afternoon dance party or a card game are usually held in the portico, a tradition which mimics a French tradition more than a Dutch or Javanese tradition. An Indies Empire Style building has a symmetrical layout and composition. It consists of a main building, sometimes with additional pavilions situated at both sides of the main building. The main building contains a central hall which connects both the front and rear portico as well as various rooms inside. A gallery connects the main building with a service building which contains rooms for slaves, storage, kitchen, and other service facilities. The whole compound is situated in a large piece of land with spacious gardens at the front, rear, and sides of the main building. Tropical palm trees usually decorate this landscaping. Examples Spacious rear gallery of Istana Bogor was used to hold social events, a typical feature in Indies Empire style.

It was built in 1921. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The Howard War Memorial was unveiled on the 17 December 1921 by local war hero and politician, Colonel Colin Rankin (father of Queensland's first woman Senator, Dame Annabelle Rankin). The pedestal was produced by Maryborough monumental mason, John T Satchwill, and the statue was imported from Italy. The memorial honours the 37 local soldiers who died during the First World War. Later plates honour the two soldiers who fell during the Second World War and one who fell during the Korean War. In 1918, a Howard and Burrum district memorial committee was established to raise funds for a war memorial. They were assisted by the ladies of the Red Cross in raising approximately . Australia, and Queensland in particular, had few civic monuments before the First World War. The memorials erected in its wake became our first national monuments, recording the devastating impact of the war on a young nation. Australia lost 60,000 from a population of about 4 million, representing one in five of those who served. No previous or subsequent war has made such an impact on the nation. Even before the end of the war, memorials became a spontaneous and highly visible expression of national grief. To those who erected them, they were as sacred as grave sites, substitute graves for the Australians whose bodies lay in battlefield cemeteries in Europe and the Middle East. British policy decreed that the Empire war dead were to be buried where they fell. The word \\"cenotaph\\", commonly applied to war memorials at the time, literally means \\"empty tomb\\". Australian war memorials are distinctive in that they commemorate not only the dead. Australians were proud that their first great national army, unlike other belligerent armies, was composed entirely of volunteers, men worthy of honour whether or not they made the supreme sacrifice. Many memorials honour all who served from a locality, not just the dead, providing valuable evidence of community involvement in the war. Such evidence is not readily obtainable from military records, or from state or national listings, where names are categorised alphabetically or by military unit. Australian war memorials are also valuable evidence of imperial and national loyalties, at the time, not seen as conflicting; the skills of local stonemasons, metalworkers and architects; and of popular taste. In Queensland, the digger statue was the popular choice of memorial, whereas the obelisk predominated in the southern states, possibly a reflection of Queensland's larger working-class population and a lesser involvement of architects. Many of the First World War monuments have been updated to record local involvement in later conflicts, and some have fallen victim to unsympathetic re-location and repair. Although there are many different types of memorials in Queensland, the digger statue is the most common. It was the most popular choice of communities responsible for erecting the memorials, embodying the ANZAC spirit and representing the qualities of the ideal Australian: loyalty, courage, youth, innocence and masculinity. The digger was a phenomenon peculiar to Queensland, perhaps due to the fact that other states had followed Britain's lead and established Advisory Boards made up of architects and artists, prior to the erection of war memorials. The digger statue was not highly regarded by artists and architects who were involved in the design of relatively few Queensland memorials. Most statues were constructed by local masonry firms, although some were by artists or imported. The statue at Howard was imported from Italy and is unique in that no concessions have been made to the appearance of an Australian soldier. The statue is depicted in full Italian Alpino uniform and accoutrements, including badges. The demarcation of the rank of Sergeant is unique to this memorial. It is also one of only two in Queensland to include a back pack, the other being the Bundaberg War Memorial. However, newspaper reports of the unveiling described the statue as an Australian soldier.  Description  The First World War Memorial is located in a prominent location facing the intersection of William and Steley Streets. It is surrounded by a low green painted fence of cast iron posts with decorative finials joined by circular rails. The sandstone and Italian marble memorial comprises a pedestal surmounted by a digger statue. It sits on three steps of red painted concrete which are surmounted by a base step of smooth- faced sandstone with chamfered corners. Above this are two more steps, each capped with cyma recta moulding. On the front face of each step is a leaded marble plaque. The pedestal itself comprises recessed square plates with leaded marble plaques on each face bearing the names of the 37 local soldiers who died in the First World War, including two who died in camp. There are also leaded plates listing those who fell in later wars; two in the Second World War, and one in the Korean War. At each corner is an engaged column with Doric order capitals and bases and fluting to the lower half. These support a small cornice, capped with a larger frieze and cornice. The digger statue stands on a base above the cornice and stands erect with the right foot forward and a tree stump for support. The life-sized statue is of Italian marble. The dress is that of an Italian-Alpino soldier, and his features are also Italian in nature.  Heritage listing  Howard War Memorial was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. War Memorials are important in demonstrating the pattern of Queensland's history as they are representative of a recurrent theme that involved most communities throughout the state. They provide evidence of an era of widespread Australian patriotism and nationalism, particularly during and following the First World War. It also has a special association with monumental mason, John T Satchwill as an example of his work. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. However, it is also highly significant as an example of an imported statue which was in no way modified for its Australian purchasers. Demarcation of rank is unique among soldier statues in Queensland and the inclusion of a backpack rare occurring elsewhere only on Bundaberg's war memorial. This statue is the most notably alien of all the imported statues on Queensland war memorials. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The monuments manifest a unique documentary record and are demonstrative of popular taste in the inter-war period. Erected in 1921, the memorial at Howard demonstrates the principal characteristics of a commemorative structure erected as an enduring record of a major historical event. This is achieved through the use of appropriate materials and design elements. As a digger statue it is representative of the most popular form of memorial in Queensland. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The Howard memorial is of aesthetic significance both as a landmark and for its high degree of workmanship and design. It occupies a prominent corner, providing a focus for the entire town. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The memorial has a strong association with the community as evidence of the impact of a major historic event. It also has a special association with monumental mason, John T Satchwill as an example of his work.

Biography Born in 1934 in Bafia, Eboussi Boulaga earned his high school diploma from the Akono Minor Seminary (South Cameroon), before joining the Society of Jesus (Jesuits) in 1955. He was ordained as a priest in 1969, and became an official member of the Society of Jesus in 1973. He became known as a polemical figure, for example in his book Bantou probl√©matique (1968), and in his theological stance, notably in La d√©mission (1974), which caused an outcry in ecclesiastical circles; this latter publication called for the organised departure of missionaries. Three years later, he published La Crise du Muntu, which tackled questions of authenticity and tradition, a particularly fashionable topic in the 1970s. In 1980, he decided to leave the Jesuits and asked to return to secular life. Boulaga's departure from sacerdotal and religious life was the product of a carefully matured decision; he claimed to have \\"lost his faith\\" since 1969. A year later, he published Christianisme sans f√©tiche, which questions the dogmatic and metaphysical assumptions of Catholicism in a colonial context. Boulaga has a Bachelors in Theology from the University of Lyon, and a Doctor of Philosophy and of Letters, and was a teacher in Abidjan, then professor at the University of Yaound√©. In the 1980s, Boulaga became active in associations for the defence of human rights. He published works, first on theology, and then on politics. From 1994 to his death, he was a professor at the Catholic University of Central Africa.

Following a college career that included representing Japan at the 2008 World University Baseball Championship, Shibata was drafted by the Tigers in 2008 and made his first-team debut for the club in the following year. After having regular playing time in the Tigers' first team early in his career, his opportunities have reduced in recent years due to injury and the emergence of younger players. Early life Shibata started playing baseball when he was in the fourth grade of elementary school. In junior high school he played for the Yahata Eagles in the Japan Boys League. He attended Fukuoka Jyoto High School and became the starting center fielder for the school's baseball club in the autumn of his second year. In his third year, he helped the school advance to the quarter finals of the 2004 Japanese High School Baseball Invitational Tournament, playing alongside Takuma Sadaoka and Ken Nishimura. Shibata attended International Budo University and twice led the Chiba University League in batting average, including a .500 average in the spring 2008 league. In his final year he was selected to represent Japan in the 2008 World University Baseball Championship held in the Czech Republic. In June 2008 it was reported that the Hanshin Tigers were considering drafting Shibata at the end of the year and he was billed as \\"Akahoshi Jr.\\" due to his foot speed. Shibata was drafted by the Tigers in the second round of the rookie draft in October 2008. Hiroki Uemoto, who played with Shibata in the Japan representative side, was drafted by the Tigers in the third round, and Shibata's high school teammate Nishimura was selected by the Tigers in the fourth round. Professional career=2009 Shibata was assigned uniform #2 and was expected to start his rookie season in the first- team squad. However, poor form during the pre-season saw him start the year in the Hanshin farm team in the Western League. He spent the year with the second-team squad, where he registered a .320 batting average in 76 games and was selected for the Western League's all-star team. He was called up to Hanshin's first-team squad on 26 September and made his debut on the same day against the Chunichi Dragons, entering the game as a pinch runner and grounding out in his only at bat. In seven games for the first team he failed to record a safe hit in five at bats, although he batted in one run with a sacrifice fly. 2010 During the off-season Shibata gave up uniform #2 for Kenji Johjima, who joined Hanshin from the Seattle Mariners; Shibata took uniform #00 that was previously worn by the retiring Shuta Tanaka. In February 2010 Shibata suffered a broken bone in his hand during a practice match against the Hokkaido Nippon Ham Fighters, but recovered in time for the opening match of the Western league season on April 10. His unremarkable performance for the farm team coupled with Hanshin's strong batting lineup meant he was not called up to the first team at any time during the year. 2011 Shibata started the 2011 in the first-team squad, competing against Shunsuke Fujikawa for the starting centerfield position. In the first half of the year Shibata was mainly used as a pinch runner and to strengthen the team's defence late in games. However, in the second half of the year he replaced Fujikawa as the starting centerfielder and batted second in the lineup. He appeared in a total of 104 matches and had a batting average of .271. 2012 Shibata started the 2012 season as the starting centerfielder and early in the season appeared as the starter against right-handed pitchers, with Yamato Maeda starting matches against left-handers. However his batting struggled compared to Maeda, hitting only .223 in his first 45 games. He started matches less as the year progressed, with stints in the farm team also. He finished the year with 73 first-team appearances and a batting average of .234. He spent part of the off-season with the Canberra Cavalry in the Australian Baseball League with Hanshin teammates Masanori Fujihara and Hirokazu Shiranita. 2013 Shibata's opportunities to play in Hanshin's first team were reduced in 2013 due to Matt Murton, Maeda and Kosuke Fukudome forming a stable outfield lineup, however he was called up to the first team in May after Fukudome suffered an injury. On May 22, in his second start of the year, he hit his first career home run against the Chiba Lotte Marines at Chiba Marine Stadium. On 3 June, in a match against the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks in his native Fukuoka Prefecture and with his family in the stands, he batted in the game winning runs and was recognized with his first solo post-match \\"hero interview\\". Whilst enjoying his career-best batting average of .297, Shibata injured his foot sliding into second base on a steal and was removed from the first-team roster the following day. He was unable to make his return to the first-team roster until September and finished the year with a batting average of .229 in 36 games. 2014 In 2014 Shibata only appeared in 27 first-team games and his batting average fell to .179. For Hanshin's farm team he batted .257 in 59 games. At the end of the season his contract salary for the following year was reduced 13% to 10 million yen. 2015 Shibata's opportunities remained limited in 2015 due to the emergence of young outfielders Hayata Ito and Taiga Egoshi. He finished the season having appeared in only 20 first-team games and batting .190. He fared better in the Western league however, hitting two home runs and batting with an average of .352 in 60 games. Playing Style Whilst in university Shibata was noted for his foot speed (50m in 5.7 seconds) and ability to throw long distances (110m). Early in his career he was noted for \\"hitting whatever came\\", but adapted to the variation used by professional pitchers after receiving advice from the Hanshin batting coaches. He has also been described as having \\"baseball smarts\\" that complement his speed. In the 2013‚Äì14 and 2014‚Äì15 off seasons he had personal training sessions with Major League player Nori Aoki, a fellow left-handed outfielder; Shibata has said he is trying to learn from Aoki and adopt his style. Private life Shibata married a 24-year-old woman in June 2012 and their first daughter was born in June 2013.

The meeting was the first between the political leaders of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait since the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1950 and the first since the meeting between Chiang Kai-shek and Mao Zedong in Chongqing during the Double Tenth Agreement in August 1945. Background Map showing Chinese territories governed by the PRC and the ROC. The size of minor islands has been exaggerated in this map for ease of visibility. During his 2012 presidential campaign, Ma Ying-jeou had stated in November 2011 that if reelected, he would \\"absolutely never meet with mainland leaders over the future four years\\". However, Ma's administration had repeatedly proposed a meeting between him and Xi Jinping since November 2012, after Xi was elected General Secretary of the Communist Party of China (Paramount leader). The 2015 meeting was proposed by Taiwan Affairs Office (TAO) Director Zhang Zhijun during a discussion on cross-strait affairs with Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Minister Andrew Hsia in Guangzhou, China in October 2015. Initially, Hsia proposed that the meeting take place during the APEC Philippines 2015 in Manila, Philippines. However, Zhang found the recommendation to be unsuitable. Later, Hsia suggested the meeting occur in Singapore, where the Wang‚ÄìKoo summit was held on 27‚Äì29 April 1993, the first cross-strait negotiation after a meeting one year earlier in British Hong Kong. Details of the meeting were leaked by Taiwanese newspaper Liberty Times on 3 November 2015, and were officially confirmed over the following days. Preparation Due to the political dispute between the two governments, officials on both sides agreed that the ROC leader and PRC leader would address each other as \\"mister\\" () and that they would participate as \\"Leader of Taiwan\\" and \\"Leader of Mainland China\\" respectively. Journalists from Taiwan ‚Äì a country accustomed to using Minguo calendar years since the founding of the Republic of China in 1912 ‚Äì had to be reissued with identification sporting a date based on the Gregorian calendar system preferred in Mainland China. The ROC Presidential Office stated that Ma intended for this meeting to \\"consolidate peace and maintain the status quo.\\" President Ma and a group of his top advisors, including Presidential Office Secretary-General Tseng Yung-chuan and Deputy Secretary- General Hsiao Hsu-tsen (), National Security Council Secretary-General Kao Hua-chu and advisor Chiu Kun-Shuan, MAC Minister Andrew Hsia and Deputy Minister Wu Mei-hung, attended the meeting with him. Reporters from around the world began setting up their equipment at the Shangri-La Hotel on 5 November. Hotel staff restricted media to the meeting's main venue, the Shangri-La's ballroom. Media attendance of the meeting was limited to 400 personnel due to security concerns. Guest access to the ballroom had been barred beginning from 2 a.m. local time on 7 November. Meeting chronology=Leaders' arrival in Singapore On 5 November 2015, Xi Jinping, the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China and President of the People's Republic of China, departed from Beijing to Vietnam as his first state visit to the nation at the invitation of General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam, Nguy·ªÖn Ph√∫ Tr·ªçng and President Tr∆∞∆°ng T·∫•n Sang. Xi continued his state visit to Singapore and arrived at the island nation on 6 November 2015 with his wife Peng Liyuan. Ma Ying-jeou took a chartered flight operated by China Airlines from Taipei Songshan Airport to Singapore on the day of the meeting. His aircraft was escorted by Republic of China Air Force fighter jets. After landing at Singapore Changi Airport at 10:30 am, Ma headed to the Four Seasons Hotel briefly where he was greeted by members of the Taiwan Business Association before meeting Xi. Meeting Meeting between Ma Ying-jeou and Xi Jinping after the handshake. At 3:00 pm Singapore Time, the leaders met at the Shangri-La Hotel Singapore and shook hands for about a minute in front of the assembled press. After the handshake, Xi and Ma respectively gave speeches. With a 30-second delay, the CCTV broadcast Xi's speech to the PRC and truncated transmission immediately after their president had finished; Ma's speech was not broadcast. However, NetEase, which was carrying the CCTV feed, immediately switched to Phoenix Television to broadcast Ma's speech to the Chinese audience. The closed-door talks followed at 3:20 pm. Post-meeting press conference Post-meeting press conference from Taiwan side. After the meeting, representative of the People's Republic of China, Taiwan Affairs Office Director Zhang Zhijun, conveyed words from Xi that the meeting was a new page in history for cross-strait relations. He reiterated Xi's four points to Ma, which are adhering to the 1992 Consensus, developing cross-strait peace, expanding the effects of the prosperity to more public segments and cooperatively pursuing the Chinese renaissance. Zhang added that Xi agreed to establish the cross-strait hotline that can help both sides communicate with each other, avoid miscalculation and also to deal during emergencies and important matters. Taiwan's participation in the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank was also encouraged. Xi told Ma that both sides are one family, emphasizing the same cultural and blood lineages of both sides of the Taiwan Strait and the improved relations over the past seven years. Ma told Xi that both sides should respect each other's value and way of life, and stating his five remarks, which are consolidating the 1992 Consensus, downgrading tension by solving problems peacefully and establishing cooperative efforts to revitalize the Chinese nation. Ma began a press conference at 4:50 pm, during which he highlighted the importance of the fine details of the 1992 Consensus. Pointing out that the atmosphere of the meeting was harmonious, Ma said that Xi's words were conducive to the practicalities of cross-strait matters. He said that both sides talked about consolidating the 1992 Consensus, and adherence to the One-China policy, but maintained that both sides are free to interpret its meaning. However, he mentioned that the 1992 Consensus was reached on the basis of \\"different interpretation\\" of \\"One China\\", not \\"two Chinas, one China and one Taiwan, or Taiwan independence,\\" none of which are permitted under the ROC Constitution. Dinner In the evening after the meeting, both leaders had dinner at the hotel. They were served crayfish, fried asparagus and spicy noodles and split the bill upon finishing the meal. Xi and Ma sat next to each other at a round table to avoid having someone sitting in the host position at the head of a rectangular table. They were served with liquor from Kinmen, site of the Battle of Guningtou during the Chinese Civil War and the First and Second Taiwan Strait Crises, to represent the state of cross-strait exchanges turning from war to peace. The two Kaoliang wine bottles presented by Kao Hua-chu (ROC) were produced in 1990, the year the Kinmen Agreement was signed. They also drank moutai, and rice wine produced in Matsu. Gifts were also exchanged. Xi Jinping gave Ma Ying- jeou an artwork by Mainland Chinese painter Liu Dawei (ÂàòÂ§ß‰∏∫/ÂäâÂ§ßÁÇ∫). Xi received a ceramic Formosan blue magpie by Lee Kuo-chin (ÊùéÂúãÊ¨Ω L«ê Gu√≥qƒ´n) from Ma, meant to exemplify the uniqueness of Taiwan. Reactions=Republic of China (Taiwan)Ma administration and the ruling party= KMT legislator Lai Shyh-bao conducting a press conference on the eve of the meeting. During an international news conference prior to the meeting, President Ma said that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait should continue to mitigate their animosity, avoid deviating from the right path and expand exchanges and cooperation. He asserted that the meeting was not for his legacy or for improving the popularity of the Kuomintang, but for the good of the next generation. Foreign Minister David Lin said the Ma‚ÄìXi meeting will focus on cross-strait peace and stability without involving any political negotiations nor leading to any downgrading of Taiwan's status, but that it would be held under the principle of equality and dignity with proper courtesy. The Kuomintang described the meeting as a \\"milestone\\" in Cross-Strait relations. =Opposition parties= There was a sense of betrayal among many Taiwanese as Ma Ying-jeou in late 2011 had promised that he would \\"absolutely never meet with mainland leaders over the next four years\\". Presidential candidate and incumbent chairwoman of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Tsai Ing-wen called the proposed meeting a manipulation of the January elections and described the decision- making process as opaque. She added that the meeting has caused a wave of questions and public doubts as people have grown to mistrust the administration's plan for cross-strait relations. The Liberty Times echoed Tsai's concerns that parliament and the public had been excluded from the decision-making. After the meeting, Tsai criticized President Ma for making no reference to preserving Taiwan's democracy and freedom. She maintained that only the upcoming elections can decide Taiwan's future. The youth division of the Taiwan Solidarity Union, formerly the third largest political party in Taiwan, threw colored smoke bombs over the cordons surrounding the Presidential Office Building. Third-force party leaders opposed the meeting. New Power Party (NPP) Chairman Huang Kuo-chang accused Ma of attempting to burnish his legacy at the expense of changing the direction of national security policy, and trampling on Taiwan's democracy and sovereignty by bypassing the Legislative Yuan. He argued that Ma's trip would violate his 2011 promises in which Ma said that he would not meet with Chinese leaders if re-elected. Social Democratic Party chairman Fan Yun said \\"Ma doesn't have any mandate for surprising us with this meeting ‚Äì ever since last year's Sunflower Movement, it has been clear that the handling of cross-strait relations by the governing party is not trusted by the people.\\" Green Party Taiwan co-convener Lee Ken-cheng added it was not clear whether Ma had made concessions to arrange the meeting. Lee further stated that calling a meeting about 70 days before the general elections, made it \\"obvious that China wants to use this to interfere with Taiwan's elections.\\" =Civil society= The Chinese National Federation of Industries, Taipei Chamber of Commerce, and Allied Association for Science Park Industries, all of which are Taiwanese business organizations, expressed support for the meeting, which is perceived to help improve Taiwan's economic prospects. Others such as a number of intellectuals and legal experts in Taiwan published articles calling on the Legislative Yuan to initiate impeachment proceedings against Ma, as they argue the handling of the meeting has violated the requirements of the due Constitutional procedures. Some scholars also asked for the intervention of the legislative body and the Constitutional Court to prevent Ma from attending the meeting. On the summit day, hundreds of angry protesters walked along a three-kilometer route from the Ministry of Economic Affairs building to the Presidential Office, condemning Ma's warm exchange with many fearing that Taiwan's democracy is being excessively influenced by China. \\"I believe this is getting to the level of treason.\\" said Lin Hsiu-hsin, vice chairman of the Taiwan Association of University Professors. Protests also occurred at the Legislative Yuan and Taipei Songshan Airport. People's Republic of China (Mainland) TAO Director Zhang Zhijun said that the scheduled meeting between the two sides is a milestone in cross-strait relations, would help enhance trust across the Taiwan Strait and consolidate common political background, and the meeting would also push forward peaceful development of cross-strait relations and safeguard peace and stability in the region. Singapore The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that the meeting is a milestone in the history of cross-strait relations since 1949. As a close and longstanding friend of both Mainland China and Taiwan, Singapore was happy to facilitate and be the venue for their direct dialogue. United Kingdom Lord Chris Patten, the Conservative politician who became the last governor of Hong Kong, said that the meeting was clearly set up to confer advantage to the Kuomintang in the forthcoming presidential elections. He however added that \\"peaceful reunification of the mainland and Taiwan remains unlikely, unless it takes place ‚Äì as China continues to promise ‚Äì on the basis of one country, two systems. But the Taiwanese cannot be very reassured by what they see happening today in Hong Kong, which was promised the same thing before its return to China in 1997.\\" Alt URL United States U.S. State Department spokesperson Elizabeth Trudeau stated that the U.S. expected \\"constructive dialogue\\" to occur, though no statements were announced upon the conclusion of the meeting. Former National Security Council member Evan Medeiros credited the warming of relations that led to the meeting to U.S. President Barack Obama's \\"pivot to Asia.\\"  References  External links  Coverage of the meeting by the South China Morning Post Cross-Strait relations 2015 in Taiwan 2015 in China 2015 in Singapore 2015 in international relations November 2015 events in Asia 2015 conferences Xi Jinping ","title":"Ma‚ÄìXi meeting"},{"id":"48457618","text":"Stay the Night is a 1992 American television crime-drama mini-series directed by Harry Winer and starring Barbara Hershey.David Hiltbrand (April 27, 1992). \\"Picks and Pans Review: Stay the Night\\".

SAP-Pakistan promotes citizens alliances, women's participation in political processes, peace and conflict prevention and aims at creating demand for access to social services and rights. SAP-Pakistan's‚Äô strengths are in its work in communities, human development, advocating for rights and system reforms. SAP-Pakistan is one of the leading and well experienced national organization in Pakistan with significant contribution in the areas of promoting public accountability and people's voices for good and responsive governance and pro-poor policies. SAP-Pakistan's struggle for a transparent and accountable governance model encompasses a broad array of diverse practices. There are several core elements that remain crucial and manifest in its approach. These include; accessing information; making the voice of citizens heard and engaging in the processes of negotiation for reform. It has a demonstrated capability of leading large advocacy campaigns, actions and programs in all four provinces and FATA. This network includes more than 2500 community groups and various civil society organizations. Through one of its initiatives for democracy and governance SAP-PK is present in 5000 villages working with cross sections of society especially with rural poor including women and non-Muslims. SAP-Pakistan's advocacy approach includes generating relevant information in public domain and various forms of direct-state interaction including community level meetings with government officials or indirect mediated forms of consultation and negotiations involving key stakeholders. As a result of this approach and subsequent practices, SAP-PK has achieved various successes and created a huge potential in four major dimensions i.e. citizen-state bridging mechanisms; attitudes and capacities of citizens and civil society actors; attitudes and capacities of state actors; an enabling environment. At present most of SAP-Pakistan's community groups, networks and advocacy alliances at provincial and national level are actively engaged in making the government and elected representatives to the account for their policies and decisions.  Organization  SAP-PK derives its name from a regional network, i.e. South Asia Partnership. This is a volunteer network of participatory development- support organizations operating under the same name and for the same purposes in Canada and four South Asian countries, Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. It has some presence in India as well, through a partnership among three organizations. All these organizations, as well as the Sri-Lanka Center for Development Facilitation collectively form SAP-International. The six national organizations; Peace and Regional Cooperation, Gender and Development, Democratic Governance, Poverty and Sustainable Livelihood, Human Security and Safe Environment and Conflict Resolutions are core themes of SAP- PK. They work together in the context of a common charter.  Relationships  SAP-Pakistan is an active member of various global forums that promote regional and global alliances of citizens and their organizations, to help advance regional and national agendas of common initiatives to strengthen the capacity of civil society. This includes peasants and rural workers, women, religious minorities and other marginalized groups. Since 1987 SAP-PK has worked with more than 10 funders and spent approximately PKR 1800 million on its different development programs and campaigns. Its main funders include Department for International Development (DFID) (or UK-Aid), Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC), Oxfam, Pakistan Poverty Alleviation Fund (PPAF), Church World Service (CWS), European Commission (EC) / European Union (EU), Agha Khan University (AKU), The Asia Foundation, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), 26 Canadian NGOs supported community projects and local philanthropists. In recent years SAP-PK has started exploring funders especially building its local resource base. Some successes have been made to raise local funds. Its program portfolio and funding base also reflects that it has successfully reached out to several active external and local funding sources.  Programs  SAP-Pakistan's work includes programs on poverty alleviation, agriculture development, livestock and dairy development, building rural infrastructure and creating livelihood solutions for the rural poor. The organization claims their development schemes have benefited around 3.5 million people, mainly women, ultra poor, landless, home-based workers and other marginalized groups. Their rural development models include efficient use of irrigation and transformed community schemes, in nearly 150 villages in the districts Layyah, Rajanpur, D.I.Khan, Gawadar, Ormara, Khyber Agency, Bhakkar and many more. SAP-Pakistan's work has been extensively monitored and evaluated by its main funders including DFID, CIDA, SDC, EU and PPAF and many others. Most of these evaluation and monitoring missions have endorsed its achievements and contribution to the marginalized sections of the society and its participatory, transparent and accountable management style. Outreach: SAP-Pakistan has four provincial offices with multiple strategic partners in numerous districts across the country. These well-established partner organizations and networks are aligned with SAP-PK's development vision and strategic direction, and also extend their full support to operate as support centers for smaller organizations and communities. This approach has enabled SAP-Pakistan to manage extensive networks and communities without incurring high operational and administrative costs. SAP-PK has a national Secretariat in Lahore. SAP-Pakistan has a large network of community groups, peasants and workers groups (PWGs) in 5000 villages (in all, four provinces and FATA/PATA), district and provincial level networks of these community groups, an advocacy network comprising 3000 civil society organizations and 1550 trained social activists who have undergone more than year-long training with SAP-PK. SAP- Pakistan has been actively working with government at district, provincial and federal levels. It has served on different committees and board constituted by the government such as Social Action Program, Social Welfare Department, Planning Commission and Rural Development and Devolution and Ministry of Information. SAP-Pakistan is a gender sensitive and responsive organization that follows gender justice policies and values in all its organizational, programme and field operations. Its governing bodies and staff composition reflects affirmative gender treatment with clear preference for women and other marginalized groups.

It was built in 1909. It is also known as Doolong Farm. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 11 March 2011.  History  Colonsay (formerly known as Doolong Farm) at Kawungan in Hervey Bay stands on of a former farm selected by a Danish immigrant in 1879. The existing structures were built during the first half of the 20th century, the high point of dairying in Queensland, and they illustrate past dairy farming practices in the Wide Bay region. The farm complex includes a residence, a slab barn with early hand milking dairy, a separator shed/cream house, two piggeries and a 1940s walk-through electrified dairy with yards. European settlement at Hervey Bay began with the establishment of the pastoral run Dalgaroom () in the mid 1850s, and timbergetting commenced in the district in the mid 1860s. Under the Crown Lands Alienation Act (1868) the entire Wide Bay region was declared a settled area and large land holdings were no longer permitted. Dalgaroom run was reduced to and renamed Toogoom, while the balance of the land was set aside for a railway reserve. From 1870 the Toogoom run was resumed and cut into blocks for sale. Many selectors around Hervey Bay were Danish immigrants, arriving from 1871 as part of an assisted migration scheme. Farms in the Pialba area grew fruit, maize and potatoes, but they did not prosper beyond a subsistence level until the railway from Colton to Pialba opened in December 1896. Another crop grown by local selectors was sugar. Four small sugar mills operated at Pialba in the 1880s, including a mill opened in 1883 by Hansen and Jorgensen, just southeast of Colonsay farm. Although all the Pialba mills had closed by 1889, following the opening of the railway to Pialba the district became a major supplier of cane to the Maryborough Sugar Factory, Mount Bauple Central Mill, Doolbi Mill and Isis Central Mill. Besides sugar, a potential source of income for local farmers was dairy farming, which did not develop as a major industry in Queensland until the early 20th century. Initially, Queensland pastoralists or local farmers kept a few cows for domestic purposes, and small dairy operations supplied milk and butter to limited local markets. However, a combination of introduced grass species, technological advances, improved transportation networks and government encouragement through legislation encouraged the rise of commercial dairy farming in Queensland. The advent of mechanical cream separators in Australia in the 1880s, the Babcock butterfat test in the 1890s, government grading of butter and the start of refrigerated shipping from Brisbane in 1884 also helped to encourage dairying. In addition, the spread of Queensland's railway network meant that some cream could be easily transported to butter factories and butter could be carried from the factories to ports for export. A further impetus for dairying was the Co-operative movement, where producers held shares in the enterprises that processed and sold their product. In 1926 about 78% of Queensland's milk production went into making butter, and in 1928 about 10% of Queensland's population was largely dependent on the dairy industry. By 1929 the Wide Bay district (of which Hervey Bay was a part) was the second highest milk producer after the Moreton District. However, when the dairy industry declined in Queensland from the 1950s onwards, due to increased competition, a loss of butter markets and higher overheads, many farmers either switched to bulk milk production or left the industry. While some old dairies were upgraded by those farmers who remained in the industry, the rest were demolished, used for storage or left derelict. In the Pialba district in the 1890s cream separators were too expensive for individual farmers to buy, and as a result a creamery opened at Aalborg (named after the town in Denmark, now known as Nikenbah). Creameries separated the cream from milk, so the cream could then be sent to a butter factory, and the farmers could take the remaining skim milk home to feed to their calves or pigs. Due to this process pig farming became a common adjunct to dairy farming. In 1901 a butter factory opened at Maryborough and Pialba farmers were able to buy their own cream separators from the factory, on credit against future payments for their cream. Both sugar and cream have been produced on Colonsay, a farm which was first established by Anders Jensen. Born in Aalborg, Denmark in 1848 Jensen had fought in the Second Schleswig War of 1864. He arrived in Queensland on 4 March 1871 on the ship Reichstag out of Hamburg, along with 328 other immigrants, mostly Danes and Germans. Of the 6400 Danes in Australia by 1891, about half lived in Queensland, and as skilled farmers they played an important role in the Australian dairy industry. Jensen married Magdalena (Madeline) Mortensen in Maryborough in 1872 and in January 1879 he applied to lease land in the parish of Urangan, County of March, under the Crown Lands Alienation Act (1876). Jensen resided on this selection, located about northeast of Aalborg, from March 1879 and Portion number 1212, of , was surveyed in May of that year. The survey map indicated that the land was covered with \\"heavy forest\\" in the north and \\"scrub\\" in the south. Portion 1212 was inspected in June 1883, and a rough map produced from this inspection shows that Jensen's house was situated in the south- east corner of the selection. This was a four roomed house, built with pine palings and covered with pine shingles. Other structures included a kitchen, fowl house, stable, pig house, and underground tank. Out of a total of of scrub cleared and burnt, five acres of land were planted with sugar cane, and the rest was planted with corn, potatoes and fruit trees. The uncultivated land was used for cattle and horses. Jensen applied to purchase his selection of 2nd Class pastoral land in November 1883. A Deed of Grant was registered to Jensen in February 1884, and later that month the farm was transferred to James Buchanan. Jensen repurchased the farm from Buchanan's widow early in 1902, and later that year he sold of the farm (in the southeast corner, which included the site of his first house) to Hans Jorgensen. Anders Jensen is listed in the Queensland Post Office Directory as a farmer at Pialba from 1900 to 1910 and when his wife Magdalena died in June 1906 Anders is listed on her death certificate as living at Doolong Farm, Urangan. Anders died in 1923. Doolong farm was sold to Alexander Macpherson, a railway guard, in late 1909. According to the Macpherson family the current farmhouse was built around this time, using timber from the property. While the current house was being constructed the Macphersons lived in another house (built by either Buchanan or Jensen) located very close by, but this later burnt down. A joint title for Alexander Macpherson and his son Alexander Macpherson junior was registered in February 1913, and the latter received full title to the land in February 1925. Both men and their wives lived in the house for several years prior to the younger Macpherson's sole ownership of the farm, and louvres were added to the front veranda to form a sitting area for the younger couple. At this time sugar was grown on the southern part of the farm, while the front was used for grazing. The slab barn southeast of the house, with its handmilking bails at its east side, was most likely built by the Macphersons. Alexander Macpherson junior died in April 1944, and the farm was transferred to Harold Spall in 1945 and then to Heinrich Steinhardt in 1949. Steinhardt grew sugar cane, ran a small dairy herd, and grew some small crops and melons. The paling fence in front of the house may have been built during his occupation, and the \\"walk-through\\" electrified dairy north of the house was probably built in the 1940s, either by Spall or Steinhardt. The old walk-through style of dairy has now been superseded within the dairy industry by herringbone or rotary-style dairies. Later owners of the farm included Herbert and Marjorie Dunn (1952) and Thomas and Rose Cornwell (1954). Walker and Jean Redman owned the farm briefly in 1968, and moved the dairy cows to another property, before the farm was resold to Marshall John McFie and Mavis Joan McFie, who moved in later that year. After the McFies purchased the farm (which they named after the McFie clan's ancestral home, the island of Colonsay off the west coast of Scotland) they made some changes to the house, including enclosing the southeast verandah with casement windows and weatherboards, and relining the walls of the enclosed southwest verandah adjacent to the kitchen. Small residential blocks were subdivided off the farm for the McFie's children in 1984, 1986 and 1994, along with some land for road purposes, and by 2008 the farm covered . It is now used for beef cattle, and is slowly being enveloped by new housing estates as the urban area of Hervey Bay expands.  Description  Colonsay Farm is located on Doolong Road, at Kawungan in the southern portion of the city of Hervey Bay, and the farm buildings are accessed by a track that runs south from Doolong Road. The 1940s dairy sits about north of the house. The separator shed is about south-east of the house, under a large tree. The slab barn is about south-east of the house, and two piggeries are located just to the south of the barn. The 1940s dairy is a rectangular timber building, partly open to the east. It has single-skin walls clad with weatherboards and a gabled roof clad with metal sheets which extends to cover a small verandah to the north-east. The building is divided into three sections by two internal walls lined with vertical boards. From north to south these include: a hay storage room with a doorway to the east, and corrugated iron cladding to part of the west wall; a \\"walk-through\\" style bail section open to the yards to the east, with four bails and four exit doors in the west wall, along with stainless steel milk lines above the bails; and the milk room, containing a cream separator, milk cooling equipment, power board, electric motor and other machinery, two benches, wash trough and doors to the east and south. Floors are formed in concrete. Yards lie to the northeast and north of the dairy and are enclosed with timber post and rail fences. There is a concrete water tank to the south of the building. The house is highset on timber stumps, with an understorey screened with timber battens. The basic plan of the house, which faces to the northeast, consists of a pyramid roofed central section which houses three bedrooms and a lounge, and a kitchen/bathroom wing which extends southwest from the northern rear corner of the house. There are verandahs to the northeast, southeast and southwest. The northwest end of the northeast verandah has been enclosed with weatherboards and timber louvres, and the southeast verandah is enclosed with weatherboards and casement windows to form several small rooms. The L-shaped southwest verandah is enclosed with fibrous cement sheeting, and the section of this verandah along the southeast side of the kitchen wing has become a dining room. There is a stove recess clad with corrugated metal sheeting at the southwest end of the kitchen. An internal stairway runs from the enclosed southwest verandah down to the understorey. Internal walls are lined with vertical timber boards. The separator shed/cream house is a small, windowless, timber-framed structure clad with weatherboards. It is located under a large fig tree, stands on a concrete slab and has a steeply pitched roof clad with corrugated metal sheeting. There is a doorway on the south side and ventilation gaps with wire netting at the top of each wall. Inside the shed are some timber shelves fixed to the wall studs. The slab barn is a gable roofed structure with two skillion roofed side rooms, to the east and west. Large round timber posts form the frame of the building, and the walls of the central gabled section are clad in corrugated metal sheeting. The walls of the skillion side sections to the east and west are constructed with vertical timber slabs and some corrugated metal sheeting. The eastern skillion section contains four cow bails formed by timber posts and rails. At the head of the bails small hatches are cut into the wall, enabling the cows to be fed chaff prepared in the centre section of the barn. The two piggeries stand south of the slab barn, with timber yards and low shelters consisting of timber frames with skillion roofs clad with corrugated metal sheeting. Structures on the site which are not considered to be of heritage significance include: a vehicle shed located between the slab barn and the house; and two open vehicle sheds located south-east of the house, just east of the separator shed.  Heritage listing  Colonsay Farm (formerly Doolong Farm) was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 11 March 2011 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Colonsay Farm is an intact example of a small, early 20th century family dairy farm. It provides important evidence of the development of dairying in the Wide Bay District, a region which became the second highest milk producing area in Queensland. Dairy farming was once an important and widespread agricultural activity in Queensland, with about 10% of Queensland's population being largely dependent on the dairy industry by 1928. The two types of dairy sheds on the farm, the handmilking bails in the slab barn, and the later \\"walk-through\\" dairy with electrically operated milking machines, demonstrate two phases in the evolution of dairy farming technology in Queensland. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. Colonsay Farm demonstrates a way of life, a function and a land use that was once common but is now uncommon. Small scale dairying was once a common means of earning regular income for farmers in rural areas of Queensland, particularly in the Wide Bay and Burnett region. After dairying declined in Queensland, many older dairy buildings were destroyed, abandoned or adapted for storage as farmers either left the industry or upgraded their buildings. Farm complexes such as Colonsay, which still contain all the intact main elements of a pre-1950 dairy farm, such as a house, walk-through dairy, piggery, and separator shed or cream house, are increasingly uncommon. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Colonsay Farm is an intact example of a small, family-operated dairy farm, developed in the early 20th century. Comprising a house with a fenced front yard, an early 20th century slab barn with cow bails, a 1940s walk-through dairy with yards, a separator shed/cream house under a large fig (ficus) tree and two piggeries, it includes many of the principal characteristics of an early dairy farm.

Most of the rocks went through honeycomb weathering, block disintegration and granular disintegration.  Loaf Rock  noneThe Loaf Rock is a stack, which is a coastal erosional landform. It was originally the headland of Chi Ma Hang, where cracks formed after rapid hydraulic erosion. The cracks enlarged and formed a cave. When it was further eroded, an arch was formed. Once the overhanging part of the sea arch collapsed, a free-standing stack was left over, which was the loaf-like Loaf Rock.  Rock of the Ringing Bell  noneRock of the Ringing Bell is a tor which looks like a ringing bell. It is located near the Fa Peng Rock. Honeycomb weathering takes place on Rock of the Ringing Bell. Salt sprays from seawater dissolved chemical materials in the rock and so produced a honeycomb look.  Eagle Rock  noneThe Eagle Rock is located near Fa Peng Rock. It looks like an eagle standing on the coast facing to the South China Sea.  Fa Peng Rock  noneFa Peng (vase) Rock is one of the most famous tor in Hong Kong. The rocks were originally below the ground surface. As the main rock type in Cheung Chau is granite, chemical weathering can easily take place. Due to the presence of deep weathering profiles, granite layer on the top turned into fine-sized soil by spheroidal weathering, and granite on the bottom turned into big, rounded corestones. When the overlying soil was removed by external medium such as wind and rain, the corestone piled up and formed this vase-looking tor. Honeycomb weathering has also been taking place on Fa Peng Rock ongoingly.  Human Head Rock  none Human Head Rock is the most famous rock along the path. From the side view, the rock bears the outline of a human face. Honeycomb weathering takes place on Human Head Rock. Deep pits like honeycombs are found on the surface of the rock due to solution of chemical materials by water. In addition, granular disintegration takes place. It is a kind of physical weathering. As different minerals expand and contract at variable rates during daytime and nighttime, different minerals may lose grains by repeated expansion and contraction. Grains are then finally scattered at the base of rocks.  Rock of the Skull  none Rock of the Skull is located near Human Head Rock. It resembles the skull with hollows at the positions of the eyes formed by honeycomb weathering and granular disintegration.  Yuk Saai Shek  noneYuk Saai (imperial jade seal) Shek is located at the end of the Mini Great Wall. Honeycomb weathering and granular disintegration take place.  Tortoise Rock  noneTortoise Rock is located beneath the Zombie Rock. Block disintegration took place in which the rock broke apart like slices of bread by physical weathering. It occurred in well-jointed rocks and an environment which large diurnal range of temperature. After repeated expansion and contraction, joints enlarged causing large masses to split away from the main rock.

Background The first electric garage door opener was created in 1921 by C.G. Johnson. He realized there was a problem with garage doors being in the way when needed to be opened and found a solution that would change the way Americans lift garage doors forever. He called it the \\"upward lifting garage door.\\" At the time that this invention was made many people were exchanging horses and buggies were begging for a more efficient way to do it. Therefore, C.G. Johnson created the \\"upward lifting garage door\\" that lifted up and completely out of the way and would take up no space since it was going up instead of side to side. Use With the use of Universal Receivers it can be used in everyday life by helping the average homeowner lift garage doors. This is used to open/close or turn on/off devices or large pieces of machinery. As for large companies this is also a necessity when importing or exporting goods. It would take a lot of labor to manually lift huge garage doors and open heavy gates. Another example are electric gate openers. This can be used for electric gate openers in a neighborhood complex for security. Instead, of having someone manually drive to the front of their neighborhood when a guest arrives a code may be given so that every time the code is inputted the gate doors will open automatically.

At least 37 people were killed, including the crew of six. One adult passenger and a baby girl were the only survivors. The crash is the deadliest aviation accident to have occurred in South Sudan since independence in 2011. Accident The aircraft was operating a cargo flight from Juba International Airport to Paloich Airport in the extreme northeastern South Sudan, an oil field. It departed Juba's runway 13 but impacted a hill about past the runway end and came to rest on the banks of the White Nile. Authorities in South Sudan reported that the aircraft was overloaded, with most of the passengers being oil workers. The government spokesman of South Sudan said that there were at least 18 people on board. Early reports of the number killed varied, but the total now stands at 37, according to South Sudan's Minister of Transportation, Kuong Danhier Gatluak. The crew of the plane comprised five Armenians and one Russian. There were initially three survivors, passenger Wuor Arop and an unrelated 13-month-old baby girl whom he had cradled, together with a third, reported to be a crew member, who later died in hospital. It is common for the security services to place family members on cargo planes to Paloich even if they are not on the manifest, according to Kenyi Galla, assistant operations manager for Combined Air Services, a company that operates chartered flights across South Sudan.

She specializes in African American literary cultural performance studies, especially 19th century and trans-Atlantic culture. She is a rock music lover and has attributed her research interests in black performance to being a fan of rock music since a very young age. She has written two books, Bodies in Dissent: Spectacular Performances of Race and Freedom, 1850‚Äì1910 (Duke University Press, 2006) and Jeff Buckley‚Äôs Grace (Continuum, 2005). She is currently working on her third book, titled Subterranean Blues: Black Women and Sound Subcultures- from Minstrelsy through the New Millennium (Harvard University Press).  Early life  Brooks was born in Redwood City, CA in 1968. Her parents moved to the San Francisco Bay Area in 1950. Brooks' father earned a B.A. in History and an M.A. in Education at the University of California. Brooks is the youngest of three children: her brother is seventeen years older and her sister is ten years older. Brooks received a BA in English from University of California, Berkeley and an MA and a PhD (June 1997) in English from the University of California, Los Angeles.  Interest in black performance  Brooks's interest in black performance was developed from her passion for rock music since she was a child. She frequently turns to music criticism to find out how a rocker's music was different from others, and how a piece of music was influenced by culture to embody greater issues like cultural heterogeneity, race and gender. Because of her passion in black rock music and substantial exposure to African American literature by her family,.  Performance studies  One of Brooks's research interests is exploring the significance of performance in the expression of black subjectivity. Brooks‚Äô definition of performance studies: ‚ÄúTo me, performance studies is a discipline that enables you to radically contextualize how we think about the production of culture and, as a black feminist scholar it enables me to think about the body and the corporeal as being central to our understanding of cultural production. So, what is performance studies? It‚Äôs thinking about embodiment as somehow enriching our understanding of text‚Äù. White audiences of the 19th and 20th centuries often perceived aspects of African American experience to be shaped by the perspective of white subjectivity, as their education was given and thus influenced by institutions led mostly by white people. Brooks believes that black experience is shaped less by whites but by black radicalism. She ascribes black performance to a comprehensive understanding of black cultural production. In her book, Bodies in Dissent: Spectacular Performances of Race and Freedom, 1850‚Äì1910, Brooks describes how, in the performance of The escape, A leap for freedom, the black protagonist William Wells Brown performs acts that both figuratively and explicitly resists the repressive institution. As the performing body embodies black radicalism itself, performance studies to Brooks is a significant way of understanding black cultural production.  Major works = Bodies in Dissent: Spectacular Performances of Race and Freedom, 1850‚Äì1910  Bodies in Dissent: Spectacular Performances of Race and Freedom, 1850‚Äì1910 (Duke University Press, 2006) is Brooks‚Äô major work on performance studies. The book seeks to explore the way black protagonists embody African American experiences as they assert subjectivity by resisting the racial institution and creating black identities through performance. Henry Box Brown emerges from a box. One chapter of the book- ‚ÄúThe Escape Artist‚Äù- examines Henry Box Brown's performance of his escape from slavery. Brown was a slave in Virginia before he escaped to the free state of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1850 by shipping himself in a box in which he hid for 27 hours. He wrote a narrative, Narrative of the life of Henry Box Brown, on his early life and his extraordinary escape from slavery. He was later invited to give stage performances of his escape story in England. Brooks describes Brown's performance of his ‚Äútraveling entrapment‚Äù in the box as ‚Äúa metaphor of physical resistance to the antebellum period‚Äôs rigorous literal and figurative colonization of black bodies‚Äù. ‚ÄúLiteral colonization‚Äù is the institution's enslavement of Brown's body and ‚Äúfigurative colonization‚Äù is its simultaneous deprivation of his subjectivity. Brown begins to undergo his ‚Äúself-making‚Äù process when the inevitable enslavement of his family evoked his desire for liberation and self-determination. Singing is a significant tool of resistance in Brown's performance. Improvising on biblical verse to create his celebratory hymns, Brown's songs essentially express his hope and ecstasy for deliverance by God. In this sense, Brown subverts the institutional colonization of his blackness by utilizing sacred songs to create a transcendent free world. Taking advantage of the institutional belief that African Americans are incapable of subjectivity-guided actions, Brown and his friends plotted his escape. They came up with a creative means of shipping Brown in a box. At the climax of the performance, Brown emerges from the box after its arrival in Philadelphia and became a free man. The emergence is symbolic of Brown's self-actualization as he is now a free man with subjectivity and the ability to determine his identity. = Reception = Bodies in Dissent is generally praised to have given a rich account of how African Americans use performance to express resistance against oppression by the white-dominant institution during the 19th and 20th centuries. Nevertheless, critic Sin√©ad Moynihan argues that Brooks fails to ‚Äúdemarcate the exact limits of the term ‚Äúperformance‚Äù‚Äù, which threatens to ‚Äúrender (the study) both everything and nothing‚Äù. The book won The Errol Hill Award for Outstanding Scholarship on African American Performance from ASTR.  Jeff Buckley‚Äôs Grace  Jeff Buckley‚Äôs Grace is a short non-fiction that examines Jeff Buckley's musical development from his early career to the release of his only full-length studio album. Brooks discovered Buckley's music while in graduate school. The inspiration of Jeff Buckley‚Äôs Grace comes from Brooks‚Äô amusement at the white artist's ability to sing like different artists at different times: ‚ÄúI was amazed that this young, stunningly handsome white guy from Southern California could sing like Nina Simone one minute and sound like Robert Plant the next‚Äù. Brooks notes Buckley's music as being shaped by a ‚Äú‚Äúwild elixir of discordant musical and cultural influences‚Äù, from Nina Simone and Billie Holiday to Led Zeppelin and Queen to Emily Dickinson and Toni Morrison‚Äù. In Brooks's words, Buckley embodied ‚Äúcultural heterogeneity‚Äù and transformed the music of the 70s, 80s, and 90s into a distinct kind of music.

He served successively as China's Minister of Labour, First Party Secretary (top leader) of his native Shaanxi Province, and a Vice Chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). He was implicated in the Liu Zhidan incident in the 1960s, and was persecuted and imprisoned for five years during the Cultural Revolution. Early life and revolution Ma Wenrui was born on November 4, 1912, into a well-off family in Zizhou County, Shaanxi Province. His mother died when he was only four. When he was 14, he began studying Marxism. He joined the Communist Youth League of China in 1926, and participated in various student movements. He then worked in revolutionary agitation in his home province. In 1935, at age 23, he was instrumental in the founding of two soviets in Shaanxi. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, he worked in northern Shaanxi near the Communist base in Yan'an, and studied military science at Counter- Japanese Military and Political University. He was one of the major leaders of the Northwest Bureau of the Communist Party, and an early follower of Xi Zhongxun. Minister of Labour and persecution After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Ma was elected an alternate member of the 8th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. He was appointed Minister of Labour in 1954. In 1962, Kang Sheng accused Li Jiantong's biographical novel about the Communist martyr Liu Zhidan as an \\"anti-Party conspiracy\\", and Ma became implicated merely because Li had interviewed him and written his name in her notebook. The three main victims, Xi Zhongxun, Jia Tuofu, and Liu Jingfan, were labelled the \\"Xi-Jia-Liu anti-Party group\\". At the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, Jia died in 1967 after repeated struggle sessions. Ma was then elevated to become a main conspirator of the group, now renamed \\"Xi-Ma-Liu clique\\", and subject to severe persecution. He was arrested in January 1968 and spent five years imprisoned at a military garrison. Post-Cultural Revolution Ma was politically rehabilitated in 1977, after the end of the Cultural Revolution, and returned to work as the deputy chair of the State Planning Commission, and Vice President of the Central Party School. In December 1978, when the Shaanxi First Party Secretary Wang Renzhong was promoted to vice premier, Ma returned to Shaanxi to succeed Wang as the province's top leader. His major contributions to his home province include the restoration of the Xi'an City Wall and the construction of the Xi'an Xianyang International Airport. He was a full member of the 11th and 12th CPC Central Committees. He was elevated to the mostly ceremonial position of the Vice-Chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in May 1984 and served until 1993, when he retired from politics. In 1990, Ma, together with Peng Zhen, founded the Foundation for Research into the Yan'an Spirit; Ma served as its inaugural president. Ma died on January 3, 2004, in Beijing. His last words were \\"I miss Yan'an\\".

Internet+Government \\"Internet + Government\\" (also known as Internet government, digital government, online government and connected government) consists of the digital interactions between the government and citizens, government and government agencies, government and employees, and government and the commerce.(Jeong, 2007) With the help of this new strategy, governments can enable anyone visiting a city website to communicate and interact with city employees via the Internet. As for ordinary people, they can access to government affairs, learn about concerned information and express their attitudes toward government. Moreover, government work such as permanent residence registration, careers guidance can be done via the internet. Internet+Agriculture \\"Internet + Agriculture\\" makes it possible to precisely know the climate, the land and all the other large data analysis for agricultural purposes. In addition, the farmers can use the Internet to acquire updated information about the price and the demand for their production. Influences and outlook Apart from Chinese government‚Äôs goal of upgrading China into a \\"powerful industrial country\\", the \\"Internet Plus\\" strategy will, most importantly, produce new economic forms and create suitable environment for the general public to make innovations or start their own business. Moreover, according to the official statement, the plan exerts a profound influence on adapting to information economy, rebuilding innovation system, intriguing creativity, cultivating emerging industry and public service pattern. Limitations and challenges A first challenge to the Internet Plus plan is that, precisely, if it‚Äôs government- powered in China, it means going through all the ladder of central, provincial and local barons. Another argument from the South China Morning Post edited in Hong Kong writes that \\"Beijing needs to address censorship before any new strategy can be expected to have an impact\\", adding that \\"we all know the key thing about the internet is freedom. If Beijing misses the point and continues to censor access to information, Premier Li‚Äôs new Internet Plus strategy will probably just get more Chinese to shop online rather than have any significant and long-term impact on the country‚Äôs long-awaited economic transformation.\\" On top of that, while Chinese government filter a lot of access to information, the relationship between Internet Plus and freedom of speech online is doubted by some people.

He was best known as the first provincial party chief in China elected by an internal democratic process, when he became Communist Party Secretary of Shaanxi in 1984. Considered an associate of Hu Yaobang, Bai fell out of favour in 1987 and was removed from his position. Early life Bai was born in Suide County, Shaanxi Province on February 19, 1926, the second son of schoolteacher and small businessman Bai Xingping (). In 1939, during the Second Sino-Japanese War, he joined Communist fighters in Yan'an, beginning his career as a revolutionary. He taught elementary school in rural Shaanxi and worked as a secretary to local party leaders. He joined the Communist Party of China in April 1942. Early People's Republic and Cultural Revolution After the foundation of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Bai began a career as a functionary in the Communist Youth League of China (CYL), working under the provincial CYL leader at the time, Hu Yaobang. Thereafter he led rural work in a provincial commission, and was also named deputy party chief of Hanzhong prefecture. During the Cultural Revolution, Bai was purged for his association with Hu Yaobang and was also labelled an associate of purged party veterans Peng Dehuai and Xi Zhongxun. Bai was placed in solitary confinement, and spent time working as a janitor. He also developed colon cancer. He resumed normal work in 1972, continuing to lead work in rural affairs. Reform era After the end of the Cultural Revolution, Bai visited the United States in the summer of 1978, as a member of the Chinese delegation. In February 1979, Bai was named vice-governor of Shaanxi, then in 1983, a member of the provincial Party Standing Committee. In August 1984, the Communist Party leadership conducted an unprecedented experiment in Shaanxi as part of wider economic and political reforms taking place around the country. An expanded session of the provincial party committee was held, during which more than 300 people, mainly officials at the county level or above, were allowed to elect the party chief of Shaanxi by secret ballot. Bai emerged the winner out of a total of 13 candidates, becoming the first provincial party chief to be elected through this experimental democratic process. As a result he was featured in a People's Daily story on November 18, 1984, as part of the party's \\"bold experimentation with cadre reforms\\", and also received coverage in international media. In September 1985, he became a member of the 12th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. The democratic experiment was short-lived, however. As Bai's patron Hu Yaobang was forced to resign in January 1987, Bai became collateral damage, and was himself forced out of office in September. The party never gave any justification for Bai's ousting. During his three-year tenure in Shaanxi, he was mostly known for spearheading Hu's economic reform activities. From 1988 to 1998, Bai served as a member of the Standing Committee of the 7th and 8th Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). He retired in March 1998. Bai died on January 15, 2015 in Xi'an, at the age of 88.

History and mission The CINC Guard CO at Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall in Virginia The original Commander-in- Chief's Guard, from which Company A claims nominal lineage, was authorized on March 11, 1776 and organized the next day at Cambridge, Massachusetts as the bodyguard and personal escort to Gen. George Washington. To the consternation of the revolutionary government in Philadelphia, it came to be referred to as \\"His Excellency's Guard\\" and \\"Washington's Life Guard\\"; in April 1777 the Second Continental Congress warned that the use of such monikers in official communications was prohibited. The Commander-in-Chief's Guard had a fluctuating strength that normally hovered between 180 and 250 men and was disbanded on November, 15 1783. The 3rd Infantry Regiment, of which Company A is part, was activated on June 3, 1784 and deactivated in 1946. In 1948 the regiment was reactivated and tasked with the military defense of the District of Columbia. The former \\"ceremonial detachment\\" of the Military District of Washington, a company-sized public duties unit, was reassigned to the 3rd Infantry Regiment as Company A, 4th Battalion. In December 1973, in preparation for celebrations of the U.S. bicentennial, Company A was designated the Commander-in-Chief's Guard and took its current form. In its public duties role, the Commander-in-Chief's Guard supports general officer retirement ceremonies, state arrivals, and the presidential inauguration.

A clothing item similar in function to today's panties was called dari sokgot (), which was a wide band of cloth pulled through in between the legs and tied with ribbons at the waist. Above this came the lowest layer of underskirts, called soksokgot (). One of these layers was a mujigi chima (), which itself was sewn of several layers at knee-length, its function was to give shape and volume to the chima, raising it. Above this a daesyum chima () was added. Noble women also wore a noreunbaji (), a kind of additional underpants. Male undergarments were significantly simpler, under the pants a pair of sokgoui (), underpants were worn, while jeoksam () came under the jeogori in winter, and was worn on its own in summer.

It is the second of three interrelated compositions in MacMillan's Easter triptych Triduum commissioned by the London Symphony Orchestra. The piece was first performed at the Barbican Centre on October 3, 1996 by the cellist Mstislav Rostropovich and the London Symphony Orchestra under the conductor Colin Davis. The work is dedicated to Mstislav Rostropovich. Composition The Cello Concerto has a duration of roughly 41 minutes and is composed in three movements: #The Mockery #The Reproaches #Dearest Wood and Dearest Iron Instrumentation The work is composed for solo cello and an orchestra comprising two flutes (2nd doubling piccolo), two oboes, two clarinets, (2nd doubling E-flat clarinet and bass clarinet), bassoon, contrabassoon, four horns, three trumpets, three trombones, tuba, timpani, three percussionists, piano (doubling celesta), harp, and strings. Reception Robert Cowan of The Independent wrote, \\"MacMillan's Concerto extends the 'dialogue of extremes' that has proved a pivotal aspect of his earlier work. It opens with a bang, and keeps the soloist busily employed virtually for the duration. It is, in a word, a 'real' Cello Concerto - lyrical, combative, rich in dialogue and scored with a skill that suggests innovative imagination and a marked respect for tradition.\\" BBC Music Magazine also praised the concerto, writing, \\"One may feel that some of the effects MacMillan uses ‚Äì the overlaid screaming brass fanfares, the extensive use of percussion ‚Äì are excessive, but they are contained within a tautly argued, tightly structured whole, and possessed of a thrillingly direct ‚Äì and profoundly affecting ‚Äì musicality. I defy anyone not to be moved by this music, whether for its considerable emotional impact or purely the artistry of its musical structures.\\" Arnold Whittall of Gramophone further opined: See also *List of compositions by James MacMillan References Concertos by James MacMillan 1996 compositions MacMillan Music commissioned by the London Symphony Orchestra ","title":"Cello Concerto (MacMillan)"},{"id":"48458609","text":"Doryodes fusselli is a moth of the family Erebidae first described by J.

The length of the forewings is 12‚Äì17 mm for males and 16 mm for females. Adults are slightly larger than Doryodes bistrialis, but noticeably smaller (especially females) than Doryodes spadaria. The medial chocolate stripe on the forewing is broader than in D. bistrialis, but narrower than that of D. spadaria. Spring males are larger than those of the summer and fall generations, so they are more easily confused with D. spadaria. The hindwing is white, without the buff coloring of D. spadaria. In late summer some males of D. spadaria can have white hindwings, but size ranges for the two species do not overlap in this generation. The hindwings are white with a very faint buffy tone. Adults are on wing from April to October. Larvae have been reared on the leaves of Spartina alterniflora and fresh and wilted Bermuda grass.

In 2015, the couple were also canonized as saints, becoming the first spouses in the church's history to be canonized as a couple. Early life=Louis Martin Louis Joseph Aloys Stanislaus Martin was the third of five children of Pierre-Fran√ßois Martin and Marie- Anne-Fanny Boureau. All his siblings died before reaching age 30. Although Louis intended to become a monk, wishing to enter the Augustinian Great St. Bernard Monastery, he was rejected because he did not succeed at learning Latin. Later he decided to become a watchmaker and studied his craft in Rennes and in Strasbourg. Az√©lie-Marie Gu√©rin Az√©lie-Marie Gu√©rin was born in Gandelain, near Saint-Denis-sur-Sarthon, Orne, France. She was the second daughter of Isidore Gu√©rin and Louise-Jeanne Mac√©. She had an older sister, Marie-Louise, who became a Visitandine nun, and a younger brother, Isidore, who was a pharmacist. Her maternal family was from the Madr√©, in the neighbouring department of Mayenne, where her grandfather, Louis Mac√©, was baptised on 16 March 1778. Z√©lie wanted to become a nun, but was turned away by the Sisters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul due to respiratory difficulties and recurrent headaches. She then prayed for God to give her many children and that they would be consecrated to God. She later decided to become a lacemaker, manufacturing Alen√ßon lace. She fell in love with the watchmaker Louis Martin in 1858 and married him, only three months later, on 12 July 1858, at the Basilica of Notre-Dame in Alen√ßon. Z√©lie's business became so successful that, in 1870, Louis sold his watchmaking business to go into partnership with her. Marriage and family Although the couple lived celibately for ten months after their wedding, they decided to consummate their marriage after a spiritual director encouraged them to do so.Louis et Zelie Martin: une saintete pour tous les temps, by Jean Clapier. Paris, Presses de la Renaissance, 2009, pp. 89-90 They would later have nine children, though only five daughters would survive infancy: #Marie Louise (22 February 1860 ‚Äì 19 January 1940), as a nun, Sister Marie of the Sacred Heart, Carmelite at Lisieux; #Marie Pauline (7 September 1861 ‚Äì 28 July 1951), as a nun, Mother Agn√®s of Jesus, Carmelite at Lisieux; #Marie L√©onie (3 June 1863 ‚Äì 16 June 1941), as a nun, Sister Fran√ßoise-Th√©r√®se, Visitandine at Caen; candidate for sainthood since January 2015; #Marie H√©l√®ne (3 October 1864 ‚Äì 22 February 1870); #Joseph Louis (20 September 1866 ‚Äì 14 February 1867); #Joseph Jean-Baptiste (19 December 1867 ‚Äì 24 August 1868); #Marie C√©line (28 April 1869 ‚Äì 25 February 1959), as a nun, Sister Genevi√®ve of the most Holy Face, Carmelite at Lisieux; #Marie M√©lanie-Th√©r√®se (16 August 1870 ‚Äì 8 October 1870); #Marie Fran√ßoise-Th√©r√®se (2 January 1873 ‚Äì 30 September 1897), as a nun, Sister Th√©r√®se of the Child Jesus and of the Holy Face, Carmelite at Lisieux, canonised in 1925. As a father, Louis loved nature with a deep sentimental enthusiasm. It was from him that Th√©r√®se inherited her passion for flowers and meadows, and for her native landscape, clouds, thunderstorms, the sea and the stars. He made pilgrimages to Chartres and Lourdes, went to Germany and Austria, travelled twice to Rome and even to Constantinople, and planned, but did not live to carry out, a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. Along with this desire for adventure was an impulse towards withdrawal; in Lisieux Louis arranged a little den for himself high up in the attic, a true monastic cell for praying, reading and meditation. Even his daughters were allowed to enter it only if they wished spiritual converse and self-examination. As in a monastery, he divided the day into worship, garden work and relaxation. As a jeweller and watchmaker, Louis loved the precious things with which he dealt. To his daughters he gave touching and na√Øve pet names: Marie was his \\"diamond\\", Pauline his \\"noble pearl\\", C√©line \\"the bold and fearless one\\", and \\"the guardian angel\\". Th√©r√®se was his \\"little queen ... to whom all treasures belonged\\". Death Z√©lie died of breast cancer on 28 August 1877 in Alen√ßon, aged 45, leaving her husband and daughters. Her funeral was held in the basilica where she had married Louis. A few weeks later, Louis sold her lacemaking business and their house along Rue St. Blaise, and moved to Lisieux, Normandy, where Z√©lie's brother Isidore Gu√©rin, a pharmacist, lived with his wife and two daughters. After Z√©lie's death, Marie(Louise), Pauline, Th√©r√®se (Fran√ßoise-Th√©r√®se), and C√©line all became Carmelite nuns, along with a cousin, Marie Gu√©rin. L√©onie became a Visitandine nun at Caen after leaving the Poor Clares. In 1889 Louis suffered two paralyzing strokes followed by cerebral arteriosclerosis, and was hospitalised for three years at the Bon Sauveur Asylum in Caen.

Canonization Relics of Louis and Marie-Az√©lie Gu√©rin Martin at Saint Patrick Church (Columbus, Ohio) Louis and Z√©lie were declared \\"venerable\\" on 26 March 1994 by Pope John Paul II. They were beatified on 19 October 2008 by Jos√© Saraiva Cardinal Martins, the legate of Pope Benedict XVI in the Basilica of Saint Th√©r√®se, Lisieux. A few months earlier, the Catholic Church had recognized the miracle of Pietro Schilir√≤, an Italian child cured of lung trouble at their intercession. For Louis and Z√©lie to be canonized, the Church needed to find that God worked a second miracle at their intercession.Canonization tapestry in 2015. On 7 January 2013, Carlos Osoro Sierra, Archbishop of Valencia, presided at the opening of the canonical process to inquire into the healing in 2008 of a girl named Carmen, who was born in Valencia four days before Louis and Z√©lie were beatified. Eight doctors testified that there was no scientific explanation for her cure. The diocesan tribunal held its closing session on 21 May 2013, and the file was sent to Rome for review by the Congregation for the Causes of Saints. On 3 March 2015 Angelo Cardinal Amato announced informally that Louis and Z√©lie Martin would be declared saints during the Synod of Bishops. The Congregation accepted and promulgated the miracle on 18 March 2015. On 26 June 2015, Miracle of Life in Valencia, a film produced by the Archdiocese of Valencia about the canonization miracle was released online in English. The next day, at a consistory of cardinals in Rome, Pope Francis approved the decree for the canonization of Louis and Z√©lie Martin and announced that the ceremony would take place in October in Rome. On 18 October 2015, Louis and Az√©lie-Marie Martin were canonized as saints by Pope Francis.

It is located on the left bank of the Rhine, a few paces downstream of the city's first bridge across the river. Early history Before the railways were built, the Rhine was the most important trade artery in western Europe, and Basel was the principal terminal point at its southern end. Beside the transshipment jetties where merchandise was off-loaded from the boats on the northeast bank of the river, there was already a guest house, identified in 1255 as \\"domus zem blumen in vico crucis\\" \\"(House of Flowers at the cross street)\\", which was probably a decade or so after the ferry crossings of the river were complemented at this point by a road bridge. However, the guest house and adjacent buildings had to be demolished after the 1356 earthquake. The first surviving record of a hotel on this site with its modern name dates from 1681, where the \\"Drei K√∂nige\\" Inn was identified as a place where itinerant merchants lodged. The name \\"Drei K√∂nige\\" means \\"Three kings\\" and is a popular name for city hotels in Switzerland and southern Germany. It is thought to be a reference to the Magi (popularly, \\"Three Kings\\") who visited Jesus shortly after His birth: the Magi, like the merchants who stayed overnight in medieval hotels, were notable for the precious merchandise they carried with them. In 1841‚Äì42 the entire site was acquired by Johann Jakob Senn, hitherto a successful master tailor who foresaw possibilities for a massive expansion in leisure travel that would follow from the revolutions in transportation brought about by the river steamer and the coming of the railways. Senn demolished the hotel and had it rebuilt in a much more luxurious style, employing the fashionable Basel architect to design what would later be seen as an early example of Belle √âpoque architecture. The rebuilt hotel reopened on 16 February 1844. From then on it would present itself as a \\"Grand Hotel\\", with a guest list that included many leading figures from the worlds of politics and the arts. Later history In 1915 the southern block of the hotel building was sold to the Basler Kantonalbank and renovated appropriately. Twenty-three years later, in 1938, the bankers moved out and this building became the City Tourist Information Office. In 2004 the hotel, together with the block that had been separated off and sold to the bank in 1915, was acquired by entrepreneur and dental implants magnate Thomas Straumann. The hotel was closed down for two years while it was comprehensively rebuilt, incorporating the southern block and with a view to recapturing as much as possible the reality of the 1844 original, but only insofar as this was possible without abandoning the more modern luxury features considered appropriate for the 21st century. The hotel reopened on 20 March 2006. In 2012 Straumann announced that he was looking for a buyer for the hotel. Disappointingly, a suitable buyer had still not been found two years later, and in December 2014 it was announced that the hotel was no longer for sale. Celebrity clientele Political leaders who have stayed at the hotel include Willy Brandt, Helmut Schmidt, Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing, and the Dalai Lama. Heads of state claimed as guests include King Farouk of Egypt and Queen Elizabeth II. In 1798 Napoleon Bonaparte had a business lunch here with Basel officials \\"to discuss French-Swiss relations\\". A more recent guest was Britain's General Montgomery. Guests from the worlds of the arts and literature have included Voltaire, Jean-Paul Sartre, Charles Dickens, Herbert von Karajan, Duke Ellington, and Marc Chagall. Theodor Herzl stayed at the hotel in August 1897 while attending the First Zionist Congress.It is no dream, Jerusalem Post The American scientist and philosopher Charles S. Peirce stayed there in January 1870. The composer and conductor Pierre Boulez was awakened by police at six in the morning in his room at the Hotel Les Trois Rois late in 2001; the officers confiscated his passport and disappeared. In 1967, Boulez had given an interview to Der Spiegel in which he said that \\"the opera houses should be blown up\\". The law enforcement officials picked up on it during a routine check of hotel guest registrations. The passport was returned after a few days.

It allows for developers to send push data from servers to Windows Phone applications. The MPNS is natively supported on applications that target the Windows Phone 8 Operating System. Microsoft announced the Windows Notification Service for Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8.1 in 2011, effectively replacing the MPNS with this service. The MPNS can be used on applications that are installed on Windows Phone 8.1 if the source code is migrated to a Microsoft Silverlight application, modified to target Windows Phone 8.1, and was already registered to use the MPNS before the upgrade. Technical details=Implementation The MPNS is natively designed for use with Windows Phone 8 applications that implement the service. It allows for developers to send toast notifications, as well as update the tile image and flip notification text on the application's Windows Metro start screen tile. This is accomplished by developers by sending POST messages to the MPNS server network with the request and relevant content. A user typically must allow for data or notifications to be received before an application will register with the MPNS for notification data. The MPNS can be implemented to send notification data using an encrypted channel if the developer purchases an SSL certificate from a third-party provider and uploads its private key and certificate data to their Microsoft Developer Portal account. Otherwise, the MPNS can be implemented to send notification data using an unencrypted channel. Applications that utilize unencrypted channels have rate and size limitations with all notification requests and content that is updated or displayed to the device. These limits can be lifted by purchasing an SSL certificate and switching to utilize MPNS encryption. Architecture The MPNS consists of servers and internal interfaces that maintain and store Channel URI Identifiers and device information, authenticate POST requests received from developer servers, and enqueue and deliver requested data to mobile devices. When an application registers for data and notifications, it receives a unique Channel URI Identifiers from the MPNS network. This identifier is used by the application developer's third- party server to reference the device that the particular data delivery request will be sent to. After the mobile device receives its Channel URI Identifier, it is then sent to the developer's server to be stored. When a server sends a POST message to the MPNS network for data delivery, the Channel URI Identifier is included within the message payload, along with the data to deliver, and any parameter options specified. The MPNS network will authenticate the identifier, and enqueue the data for delivery to the mobile device.

In 1864, the infantry section of the 1st Bengal Military Battalion was taken into the line as a regular infantry battalion of the Bengal Army as the 45th (Rattray's Sikhs) Regiment of Native Infantry, and the cavalry section was disbanded, and Habib Khan thereafter retired and left for home. He was a recipient of the Indian Mutiny Medal. Later life On retirement, Habib Khan came back to Hazara area, and also entered into extensive litigation against the Punjab Government , to obtain restitution of a number of his properties, and in settling the affairs of his considerable estates.Hazara District Gazetteer, 1883-84, p 81-82 In 1872, he was made a JP and a Kursi Nasheen for the Talokar Haripur area, and also given the personal title of Nawab-Bahadur and awarded the CSI. and received a 'Jangi Inam' (war/veteran soldier's allowance). Govt of Indian Gazette notices, Calcutta 1872, 1875 Between 1868 and 1880 he assisted senior officers in the management of Frontier affairs along the Hazara hills, receiving certificates of commendation from Sir Herbert Benjamin Edwardes and NG Waterfield, Commissioner of the Peshawar Division. Habib Khan actively supported the Muslim liberal reformer Sir Syed Ahmad Khan and his movement to educate Muslim youth according to the contemporary modern standards, what was later to develop into the Aligarh Movement; and along with the likes of Nawab Muhammad Hayat Khan and other Punjabi and Pashtun leaders, he made significant contributions towards this cause. It was claimed that, \\"unlike many narrow- minded and bigoted Muslim chiefs\\" he was a person of eclectic views and followed a liberal, tolerant Sufic perspective,maintaining 'close life-long friendships with his old Sikh and Hindu colleagues-in-arms'. Among his children, two sons, Khan-sahib Abdul Majid Khan Tarin, OBE, and Abdul Latif Khan Tarin, IDSM, were notable.

History= South Africa  In 2015, MMM began operating in South Africa with the same business model as MMM-2011, claiming a \\"30% per month\\" return through a \\"social financial network\\". The group was identified as a possible pyramid scheme by the National Consumer Commission and accounts of clients were later frozen by Capitec Bank. In response to mounting criticism and official investigations by state authorities in 2016, supporters of the South African MMM scheme staged a protest march in Johannesburg. and had started up again in late November 2016.  Nigeria  In November 2015, MMM launched a website targeting the Nigerian audience, also claiming a \\"30% per month\\" return including other acquirable bonuses. The entity was self-described as a \\"mutual aid fund where ordinary people help each other.\\" 2.4 million people had signed up by late 2016, with the country's unemployed as primary targets. Nigeria's Economic and Financial Crimes Commission confirmed that it was monitoring the scheme. On December 13, shortly after celebrating its first anniversary amid a festive mood from some members, MMM Nigeria announced the freezing of all members' accounts due to what it called \\"systems overload and the negative attention brought on by the Government and mass media\\". This led to wide spread panic in the nation and even attempted suicides. On December 14, LASEMA (Lagos State Emergency Management Agency) of Lagos State pleaded with Lagosians to dial their emergency number if they spot anyone trying to commit suicide. LASEMA took this action due to the number of suicides MMM caused in Russia In 2017, the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG) in Nigeria warned all members against participating in MMM It was said that some RCCG church pastors were promoters of the scheme from the beginning more than one year ago when MMM made its entry.http://www.financialwatchngr.com/2016/10/31/outrage-rccg- induce-church-members-register-mmm-nigeria/title=Outrage as RCCG Induce Church Members to register for MMM Nigeria By January 2017, hundreds of other similar Ponzi schemes jumped into the ever-widening Ponzi industry in Nigeria, amid reports that MMM had crashed in December 2016. Some of these schemes include ABCDonor, Twinkas, Ultimate Cycler etc., with rates offered soaring anything up to 200%. All these imitators seek to outdo MMM Nigeria by offering extremely generous rates, creating a cascading effect on the sector. MMM Nigeria reopened on January 13, 2017, but has been plagued by grievances from participants concerning delayed or unfulfilled payments. This has been attributed to spiraling fear sweeping amongst participants, some of whom have moved to new Ponzi schemes. On February 11, 2017, MMM Nigeria announced the lifting of withdrawal limits on the 2017 mavro (i.e. mavros paid for in 2017 could be withdrawn without limits) while no specific limit for 2016 mavro was stated.http://www.vanguardngr.com/2017/02/mmm-nigeria-coming-back- normal/title= MMM nigeria coming back to normal This aimed to encourage new participants to enter, giving old members some assurance of getting back their money. However, this has not allayed the fears of some old members especially after MMM told them that to get back their pre-2017 money they should add new money and the more money they add the better the chances of recovering their old money. In its tweet releases, MMM claimed that programmers will be working towards implementing the release of 3x the amount paid in as new contribution from the old mavros. The tweets however don't say when this will be done. MMM Nigeria has made some charity and humanitarian donations to the Nigeria Society like donations to internally displaced people's camps and hospitalized patients, but critics hold that this is a stunt to regain credibility after disappointing existing investors whose money got stuck in the scheme. This strategy of image-cleaning, according to critics, seeks to hoodwink and attract new unsuspecting recruits and use their money to pay off the stranded existing investors. Ponzi schemes rely on new contributions to pay existing contributors which make them unreliable since it cannot continue attracting new contributions forever in the required numbers and rates (numbers which actually accelerate quickly at exponential rates with every new level of recruitment). Even if the whole population becomes participants this shows there is a limit beyond which no further recruitment is possible or recruitment begins to slow down sharply enough to cripple the scheme's paying ability. Therefore, the scheme is ultimately doomed to fail and it is only a matter of when, not if. Some believers in MMM however adopt varying responses to critics; \\"After all nothing lasts forever\\",\\"MMM is an insurance company without guarantee or insurance\\" hence sighting many public listed companies, pension/mutual funds that did not pay back anything to investors,\\"it is a gamble,so no guarantees\\", \\"It is a Communist ideology the capitalist won't understand\\". In view of the rumored suicides of victims and financial losses to victims of up to 18 billion Naira (or $60m as of March 2017), questions have been raised why there has not been a serious media or government effort to push back against the faceless new schemes multiplying willy-nilly in Nigeria on a daily basis, as most of these barely last more than 3 months with consequent heavy distress to many. It is still not clear to many participants how the media come about the figure of losses. Many old participants still believe that all contributions were made to and fro fellow participants. hence it should not be counted as a loss as the terms of association is clear, \\"Mutual Donation Aid\\". On 22 February 2017 MMM Nigeria released a news through personal Office, that all the suggestions of the participants will be considered for implementation: all bonuses acquired in 2016 will be frozen and the growth of 2016 30% mavro stopped.  Zimbabwe  In July 2015, MMM East Africa, launched subsidiary \\"MMM Global Zimbabwe\\" targeting the Zimbabwe population. MMM offered its participants \\"30% per month\\" return on all investments. It soon became widely popular in urban areas of Zimbabwe. The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe warned its citizens to stay clear of the program as it could be a fraudulent scheme. On September 2016, MMM Global Zimbabwe issued a freeze on all accounts, speculations suggest that this occurred due to a fall in number of participants. On 5 September 2016, all MMM accounts were unfrozen, and members were encouraged by MMM to continue \\"investing\\" their money, however the MMM unfreeze came with a catch; Members would get an 80% loss of their available funds should they decide to withdraw their funds. This made some participants let their funds remain in the program while others withdrew their funds to suffer an 80% loss of their money \\"invested\\". This affected 66,000 Zimbabweans and caused some economic instability.  China  The scheme began in China in 2015 and collapsed in early 2016. In January 2016, the Chinese government banned MMM on the grounds that it was a pyramid scheme and was not registered in the country (since a fraudulent scheme cannot be registered).  Ghana  In November 2016, MMM was launched in Ghana. Kenya In October 2016, it was reported that MMM entered Kenya and opened a local subsidiary. MMM Kenya offers similar terms to participants as in other countries, including a monthly 30% interest rate to contributors to the scheme.http://www.nation.co.ke/news/Russian-fraudster-sets-up-pyramid-scheme- in-Kenya/1056-3428676-mksht9/title= Russian fraudster sets up pyramid scheme in Kenya In December 2016, the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK), without mentioning MMM Kenya, issued a warning that \\"virtual currencies such as bitcoins are not legal tender in Kenya\\" It further said \\"no protection exists in the event that the platform that exchanges or holds the virtual currency fails or goes out of business.\\" The entry of MMM Kenya has raised fears of a replay of misfortunes that hit Kenyans in 2007 when 148,784 investors lost 8 billion Ksh to 270 fraudulent pyramids and ponzis. A parliamentary report indicated that there was a spate of suicides, stress-related illnesses and family breakups as a result of the losses and directors of the companies stashed some of the proceeds in tax havens such as in Panama.http://www.nation.co.ke/news/1056-3146138-73v4hsz/index.htmltitle=How the masterminds of pyramid schemes duped thousands into parting with their money In April 2017, CBK warned the public against investing money in pyramids and unlicensed financial institutions, noting that there was a big comeback of new creations of pyramids. It said \\" ‚ÄúSuch entities entice members of the public to place money with them and promise quick and abnormally high returns on their money or acquisition of non-existent properties.‚Äù Brazil In December 2015, it was reported that MMM entered Brazil and opened a local subsidiary. MMM Brazil offers similar terms to participants as in other countries, including a monthly interest rate of 50% for contributors to the scheme.

The concerto was the first of four that Spohr would compose in his lifetime, all of which were dedicated to the German clarinet virtuoso Johann Simon Hermstedt. Spohr was inspired to write the concerto after meeting Hermstedt in Sondershausen and performing the Mozart Clarinet Quintet with him, with Spohr playing the first violin part. Spohr began work on the Concerto No. 1 soon after, and finished it in January 1809. While Spohr was familiar with the range of the clarinet, he was not aware of its limitations and was willing to alter the score according to Hermstedt's advice. However, Hermstedt liked the score the way it was and decided to alter his own instrument to be able to play the piece. The result was an instrument with thirteen keys instead of the usual five.Warsop, Keith. \\"Clarinet Concerto No 1 in C Minor, Op 26 (Spohr) - from CDA67509 - Hyperion Records - MP3 and Lossless Downloads.\\" Clarinet Concerto No 1 in C Minor, Op 26 (Spohr) - from CDA67509 - Hyperion Records - MP3 and Lossless Downloads.

The first 50 Shaun sculptures appeared in London from 28 March to 31 May 2015, with a further 70 Shaun sculptures appearing in Bristol from 6 July to 31 August 2015. The charity project aims to raise funds for sick children in hospitals across the UK, with funds from the London trail supporting Wallace & Gromit‚Äôs Children‚Äôs Charity, and funds from the Bristol trail supporting Wallace & Gromit‚Äôs Grand Appeal, the Bristol Children's Hospital Charity. It follows on from Gromit Unleashed, a charity arts trail which saw 80 sculptures of Gromit placed on the streets of Bristol in 2013, raising ¬£2.3 million at auction for The Grand Appeal. Shaun the Sheep Created by Nick Park of Aardman Animations, Shaun the Sheep is an unusually clever sheep who first appeared in the 1995 Oscar-winning short film A Close Shave, helping Wallace and Gromit to rescue his flock from being turned into dog food by a malfunctioning robotic dog. In 2007 he was given his own stop-motion animated television series, and in 2015 he starred in a feature-length movie, titled Shaun the Sheep the Movie. In 2014 he was voted the nation's favourite children's television character in a poll conducted by the Radio Times and the British Film Institute. Shaun in the City London Trail On 24 March 2015, Shaun in the City launched to the public and press in London. A number of sculptures were driven across Tower Bridge and London Bridge on a trailer drawn by a tractor. Nick Park, creator of Shaun the Sheep, was also in attendance, helping to unveil more sculptures in a sheep pen near the Thames. The 50 London sculptures were designed by a number of artists and celebrities including David Gandy, Dame Zandra Rhodes, and brands such as Cath Kidston and Hello Kitty. They were placed in famous locations and green spaces around the capital including Trafalgar Square, Tower Bridge, The London Eye, Covent Garden, St. James's Park, and The Shard. The charity also launched a dedicated Shaun in the City Youtube Channel, showing films promoting the trails and app, interviews with celebrity designers including David Gandy, and behind-the- scenes videos of artists at work. Shaun in the City Bristol Trail The Bristol trail launched on 2 July 2015, with Shaun the Sheep creator Nick Park driving a vintage tractor across Clifton Suspension Bridge, pulling a trailer containing several sculptures. The 70 sculptures were then distributed around the city for the beginning of the trail on 6 July, with locations including Bristol Temple Meads station, Bristol Harbourside, Clifton Suspension Bridge, Staple Hill, and Bedminster. Designs were again contributed by artists and celebrities, with VIP designs including Bagpuss Shaun by Bagpuss creator Peter Firmin, and Sheepish, a giant pink poodle created by fashion designer Wayne Hemingway. Aardman Directors Nick Park and Peter Lord also designed Shaun sculptures. The charity organisers also created the Shaun in the City: Nature Explorer, a booklet of activities intended to get young children engaging with nature and learning about the environment as they visited six sculptures in green locations throughout Bristol during the trail. Shaun in the City: Sheep Spotter App Wallace & Gromit's Grand Appeal and the digital team at Aardman Animations developed an interactive app called Shaun in the City: Sheep Spotter for the two trails, available for Apple and Android devices. Within 24 hours of release the app took the number one spot in the Apple iTunes App Store chart for paid-for apps. By the middle of the Bristol trail over 1,000,000 sculptures had been ticked off using the app, which also allowed visitors to complete special trails, learn about the sculptures and artists, and earn interactive trophies. Great Sheep Round Up Exhibitions Following the end of the Bristol trail, all 120 Shaun sculptures from both the London and Bristol trails were united for two special 'Great Sheep Round Up' exhibitions, the first in Bristol at The Mall at Cribbs Causeway, and the second in London's Covent Garden. There was extremely high public demand for tickets for the Bristol exhibition, with over 25,000 visitors attending over the course of nine days. Auction On 8 October 2015 all 120 sculptures were auctioned to raise money for sick children in hospitals across the UK, in a special evening hosted by Sotheby's auctioneer and TV presenter Tim Wonnacott. Money raised from the London sculptures benefited Wallace & Gromit's Children's Charity, and money raised from the Bristol sculptures benefited The Grand Appeal, the Bristol Children's Hospital Charity. 5 miniature Shauns ‚Äì ‚ÄòLittle Princess‚Äô, ‚ÄòJetsetter‚Äô, ‚ÄòCatch of the Day‚Äô, and two Shauns decorated by young patients in Bristol ‚Äì were also auctioned in aid of Bristol Children's Hospital. The auction raised ¬£1,087,900 in total for the two charities. The Shaun sculpture which attracted the highest bid on the night was ‚ÄòGlobetrotter‚Äô by Sarah Matthews, selling for ¬£28,000. ‚ÄòSparkles the Unicorn‚Äô by Emily Golden was also the subject of a bidding war, finally selling for ¬£25,000.

S. Satyaranjan. Inculturation and the practicalities Timotheas belonged to the Lutheran Danish Santal Mission (Northern Evangelical Lutheran Church). In the 1960s, an unexpected turn of events took place relating to the issue of inculturation. Although Timotheas had his schooling at the Mission schools established by the Danish Santal Mission which was founded in 1867,G√ºnther Gassmann, Mark W. Oldenburg, Historical Dictionary of Lutheranism, Second Edition, Scarecrow, Lanham, 2011, p.112. where he grew on strong Christian ethics and enrolled for theological studies at the Santal Theological College, Dumka district and later at the Protestant Regional Seminary in Bangalore where he completed graduate studies in theology (Bachelor of Divinity), returning to his alma mater in 1970 to resume teaching when J. T. Krogh still happened to be the Principal. This was the 1960s when the Second Vatican Council had concluded and Papal encyclicals were issued concerning the local cultures and their adaptation in the Christian liturgy. Rev. Fr. D. S. Amalorpavadass who pitched for inculturation at the Second Vatican Council found that his appeals had been met. However, back at the Santal Theological College, the Lutherans were yet to adapt the local traditions into the Christian liturgy. During that period, Timotheas Hembrom took a couple of his students to a Santali wedding where they happened to participate in music and dance which involved the playing of Santal music using the Tamak' and Tumdak'. The Danish Santali Mission (Northern Evangelical Lutheran Church) took a rigid stance debarring not only Timotheas Hembrom but even those students who accompanied him. In the ensuing student unfriendly environment, the Principal, J. T. Krogh voiced his apprehension at the decision of the Council of the Northern Evangelical Lutheran Church and left the College taking along with him the five debarred students as well as his debarred colleague Timotheas and joined en masse in the Church of North India-led Bishop‚Äôs College, Calcutta. The students continued their studies at the Bishop‚Äôs College, Calcutta, Timotheas Hembrom was sent by the College for postgraduate studies to Bangalore while J. T. KroghDansk Biografisk Leksikon (Danish Biographic Lexicon), 2011 was accommodated into the FacultyDanish Mission Photo Archives, Folder 114 at the Bishop‚Äôs College, Calcutta. Timotheas continued to be grateful to the Lutheran Danish Santal Mission (Northern Evangelical Lutheran Church) and rather attributed the circumstances to lack of understanding at that point of time. The issue of inculturation, also referred to as indigenization took a dominant role in the scholarly meetings of the Society for Biblical Studies in India in which Timotheas also happens to be a member. Successive biennial conclaves of the Old Testament and New Testament scholars of the Protestant, Orthodox, Catholic and Charismatic traditions discussed whether it is possible to interpret the Bible in an Indian way. Rev. Fr. Joseph Pathrapankal, Rev. Dr. E. C. John, Rev. Fr. Matthew Vellanickal and other members of the scholarly society contributed immensely to the Indian interpretation and adopting of traditional forms in worship. Year's later, Biblical scholars also published Indian Interpretation of the Bible in 2000 honouring Rev. Fr. Joseph Pathrapankal. Similarly, Comparative religion scholars of the Indian seminaries began to adopt the native traditions and particularly the Indian ethos in Christian liturgy. Ecclesiastical ministry=Benagaria Timotheas was a Teacher at his alma mater, the Santal Theological College, Benagaria and started his ecclesiastical teaching ministry. After a two-year break during 1968-1970 to upgrade his academics at Bangalore, he returned to the BenagariaRuby Hembrom, The Santals and the Bodding Paradox, paper presented at the Paul Olaf Bodding Symposium during 3‚Äì5 November 2015 at the University of Oslo. and taught again during 1970-1971. Cherrapunji After Timotheas specialised in Old Testament, he proceeded to the Chera Theological College, Cherrapunji where he taught from 1973-1977. Kolkata After a stint of four years at Cherrapunji, Timotheas moved to the Bishop‚Äôs College, Kolkata and was Professor of Old Testament from 1977. His other colleagues at the Seminary included the renowned Religions Scholar, Yisu Das Tiwari.Ravi Tiwari, Yisu Das: Witness of a Convert, ISPCK, New Delhi, 2000.

Origins  Julia Becerra Malvar was born in the family palace in Salcedo (Pontevedra, Galicia, Spain) on 9 April 1892. On her father's side, she was related to the Becerra family. Her father, Manuel Becerra, together with other Galician noblemen, gifted King Alfonso XIII the Island of Cortegada. Both her uncle and her grandfather, her parental relatives, were Ministers of the Republic Government. On her mother's side, she was related to Archbishop Malvar and to the famous writer Emilia Pardo Baz√°n. The marriage had five children, their names were Mercedes, Teresa, Josefina, Julia and Joaqu√≠n.  Childhood  Julia Becerra came from a noble family from Galicia. She grew up in an environment that encouraged her political interests and her admiration for her homeland, Galicia. When she was young, she lived in Pontevedra. She spent her summer time in Barrantes, a little village in the province of Pontevedra, where her family owned a palace(Pazo de Barrantes) Julia and her sisters did not go to school, however they had a private teacher at home. Julia had an original personality. She was very intelligent, open-minded, funny although naughty. When she was ten years old she traveled to Paris to take care of her aunt. She lived there for six years. She went to Paris to study hat design, opera, piano and moreover, dress making. One of her childhood anecdotes was told by her granddaughter, Maria Cristina Cebri√°n Sagarriga. When Julia was a child she wrote a false note to her nanny saying: \\"Give me twenty \\"duros\\" or I will detonate the bomb\\", because the nanny did not let her get out of the Salcedo Palace. After that, the nanny sent a telegram to her parents saying: \\"There is a bomb. I am leaving.\\" This is just an example of her many pranks as a child.  Early adulthood  Julia did not go to college because women could not go in those days. When she was 12 years old she went to Paris to look after her aunt. There, she studied singing at the conservatoire. She also studied dressmaking and hat design. In 1910, when she was going to make her debut at the Milan's Scala, her father brought her back to Spain because he did not want her to be a singer. In revenge, Julia married Vicente Sagarriga, three months after she met him. They met in a racecourse in Madrid Julia was 18 years old and Vicente was 22. Before her first daughter was born, she wanted to move to Santiago de Compostela because she wanted her daughter to be Galician. Her hobbies were music and gardening, also she liked cooking and designing clothes for herself and her family. She never had a job she was paid for, but she was a nurse at the World War II. Moreover, she sang for charitable causes. She defended Galicia's culture and language. Besides she was a feminist. This ideology was unusual in the society of that time.  Late adulthood  Julia Becerra Malvar met Vicente Sagarriga at the racecourses in Madrid. He was a rich landowner from Valencia. He was the earl of Creixell and also he was a lawyer. Three months after they met, when Julia was eighteen and Vicente was twenty-two, they married. Her parents gave them the Barrantes Palace. They had two children. Julia was born on 9 June 1911 and Cristina on 6 September 1920. In the winter, they used to live in Madrid and in the summer they would go to Barrantes for the holiday. However, when the earl of Creixell fell ill with tuberculosis, in 1933, they decided moved into the Barrantes Palace. He died on 11 May 1935. Julia was married for the second time to Frank Eric Arbenz. He was Swiss and he was the delegate of the International Red Cross in Spain. During the Second World War Julia went around Europe with her second husband. She helped in the humanitarian work, hospitals and refugee camps. As it was told by her granddaughter Cristina Cebri√°n, Julia was really impressed by all the technological and medical advances that she could see at the American hospitals. When the war was finished, Eric and Julia came back to Spain. The hardest years for Julia started when her son-in-law, Jaime Cebri√°n, died in 1962. Three years later her second husband died too. However, the worst moment of her life was when her two daughters and two grandsons died in a traffic accident in 1967. Julia suffered so much. However, because of her inner strength, she was able to go forward with her family. According to her granddaughter Cristina, who was pregnant at that time, Julia did not let them wallow in their misery, instead she forced them to go on with their lives.  Social and political life  Julia grew up in an atmosphere which encouraged her political interests and her adoration for her home village. When she was little she had a lot of influences which drove her to her interest in politics. On her father' side she had relatives who were ministers of the nation during the first and the second republic. However, her father, who was the mayor of Pontevedra, was a monarchic man. She was educated by particular teachers, as in that time very few women received some type of education. Later, she liked music but her parents thought that she could have a more important occupation. When she became an adult and a married woman, she was a woman anticipated to her time, she was very liberal, independent and very interested in politics and her home village, Barrantes. Consequently, when she was married her parents gave her \\"El Pazo de Barrantes\\" where she spent all the summers. She was very interested in the people from Barrantes, the farmers, the poverty, the insolation and so on. Her friends had a political ideology which helped her to define her own ideology; that is, a mixture of pro-Galician feeling, pro-land reform movement and conservative ideas. Due to all these ideas she met Ram√≥n Cabanillas, Camb√≥ and Jos√© S√°nchez Guerra. On 25 September 1930, several important galician intellectuals and Julia met in Pazo de Barrantes to write a document which demanded the rights of Galicia. This is known as the Barrantes agreement (Pacto de Barrantes). This contract was signed by Ram√≥n Cabanillas, Paz Andrade, Basilio √Ålvarez and others..... except Julia because she was a woman. This caused her to have problems with her family and some of her politician friends. During the Primo de Rivera dictatorship, Julia Becerra, a woman with strong democratic convictions, was as dissatisfied with the dictatorship as her friend Jos√© S√°nchez Guerra. Otherwise she had a good relationship with the general Primo de Rivera. As a consequence we can tell she was an open-minded woman, because she was friends with very different people. Julia, countess of Creixel, was always between the devil and the deep blue sea because although she was in favour of the Republic, she was a friend of the king Alfonso XIII too. Besides the people who met in Barrantes were not in favour of the republican regime because the contract was judged in a very different way outside Barrantes. After the republic reclamation Julia participated more in politics, for instance she ran as a deputy in the province of Pontevedra, although she was not elected. During the Spanish Civil war she had a lot of contacts in the republican party, so she helped a lot of people who had their lives in danger.She contributed to saving a considerable number of lives thanks to her links to the organization \\"Socorro Blanco\\" The Spanish Civil war was a hard time for everybody. Her granddaughter Cristina Cebri√°n explains that thanks to the Barrantes Palace¬¥s house keepers, Julia and her family never lacked food or money because they kept all her shares despite the war. Some years later, she renounced to give up politics when the Civil war finished with the democracy in Spain.  Later life  Julia spent the final years of her life in Spain, in Barrantes to be precise, after performing humanitarian works around Europe during W.W.II. She liked talking with her neighbours, in particular she was very interested in town problems. Although she liked singing and playing the piano for her family, Julia also loved working in the fields, specially during the grape harvest. She used to work elbow to elbow with the country people. Julia spoke Galician with them, even though she usually spoke Spanish and French with her family. Something very special for her was to visit the Mosteiro Fair (A Feira de Mosteiro) where people traded with cattle. Besides she also liked discussing prices with the traders. During 1962, Julia lived through a hard time,when her son-in-law Jaime Cebri√°n died. However, in 1965 the situation was made worse when her second husband, Arbenz, died. Although the hardest was in 1967, when her two daughters and two of her grandchildren died in a car accident. She was sad in her later life because she had painful losses in her family. People who remember her talk about her strength and about her bravery despite her disgrace. She gave a lot of courage to her grandchildren so that they could get over their mothers' death. It should be mentioned that she donated a great part of her land so that the local school was built, just because she loved Barrantes and its inhabitants very much. The school is called nowadays CPI Julia Becerra Malvar in her honour. In her last years, she went blind, which changed her life considerably. Julia died on 27 April 1974 in Madrid, when she was 82. She had a very interesting although hard life, in particular when her daughters died. In spite of her many achievements, she is not a well-known character of the 20th century in Galicia. On May 2009, her ashes were moved to the Barrantes cemetery.  Bibliography  *√Ålvarez, Patricia: \\"El pacto de Barrantes y su musa: Julia Becerra Malvar\\".

She worked for the Signals Intelligence Service and National Security Agency from 1943 until 1976. Biography Juanita Morris was born in 1924 in Morven, North Carolina. She began studying at Western Carolina University in 1942. She left in early 1943 to join the war effort; she volunteered at a recruitment office in Charlotte, North Carolina, and in April she was sent to Arlington Hall, the headquarters of the Signals Intelligence Service, in Arlington, Virginia. She began training in cryptanalysis while waiting for her security clearance but was later transferred to an administrative library role. She remained interested in cryptanalysis, however, and joined a group that met outside of work to study a complex, unbroken German code system; as a result, she was assigned official code-related tasks. She was successful in breaking a German one-time pad cipher, and by the end of the war she had been promoted from code clerk to a head of office. She planned to return to Western Carolina University at the end of the war, but her supervisor asked her to remain with the SIS. She agreed on the condition that she was given a more complicated job. In 1948, she married fellow civil servant Warren Moody. Moody was promoted to the National Security Agency's research and development department after the war, where she became involved in computational cryptanalysis and analytic machines. Through the 1950s, she was a supervisor of Soviet analytic affairs and in the early 1960s was the head of signals intelligence operations to gather information about Cuba in Operation Mongoose as the chief of the Office of Non-Communist Nations. She oversaw the NSA's responses to the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962 and was responsible for deciding what information relating to the crisis would be collected, processed and released. She was promoted to higher positions in the NSA throughout the 1960s and early 1970s but became the focus of controversy in 1975 when she was called to testify in front of a Senate committee that was investigating abuses of power in federal intelligence agencies. Her name was widely associated with the investigation in the press, but the NSA later clarified that she was not involved in any abuses of power and that her involvement in the investigation was as a spokesperson. In 1975, Moody was awarded the inaugural National Intelligence Medal of Achievement. She retired from the NSA the following year after 33 years of working for the agency. She was inducted into the NSA Hall of Honor in 2003.

Taxonomy The species epithet honours Philip Barker Webb, a botanist from the 19th century. The type is kept at the herbarium of the Liverpool Museum. In the 1998 Flora Republicae popularis Sinicae A. R. Li classifies R. webbianum in section Rheum together with R. compactum, R. likiangense and R. wittrockii. Description Habitus Rheum webbianum is a perennial herbaceous plant which grows from in height. It has a stout, hollow stem bearing the inflorescence, this is finely sulcate (with many fine fissures in profile) and glabrous (hairless) or covered in papilla (papilliferous) on the surface of its upper part. This plant is very variable, especially in the leaf size and plant height. Leaf of Rheum webbianum in the Giardino Botanico Alpino Viote. Leaves It has a stout, long petiole on its basal leaves which is shorter than blade and papilliferous. Leaves are leathery, and green on the upper side and muricate on the lower, or papillose or glabrous. The shape of the leaf blade is entire, orbicular, cordate (heart- shaped), reniform-cordate to reniform (kidney-shaped) in shape, long (more usually ), from (more usually ) wide, and with the blade shorter than wide. The leaf blade has five to 7, nearly basal, main veins. The apex (tip) of the leaf blade is obtuse (rounded) or subacute (slightly pointed), the margin is slightly sinuolate (wavy), and the base is broadly cordate. The upper leaves on the inflorescence stem are smaller and are ovate in shape. Flowers The inflorescence is a large, diffusely branched (once or twice), densely-flowered panicle up to 1m tall, with the flower clusters usually axillary, less commonly terminal (at the end of the racemes). The small flowers have no bracts, are pale yellowish in colour, have a diameter of , have a filiform (wiry), 3-5mm long pedicel which is jointed below middle, and have elliptic- shaped tepals. Fruit The winged fruit is notched (slightly retuse) on both ends; the wings are broad, approximately 3.5mm wide, and with longitudinal veins near their margins. The fruit is broadly oblong/ellipsoid or orbicular in shape, 8-12mm across, approximately as long as wide. The seeds are narrowly ovoid-ellipsoid in shape, approximately 4mm wide. Karyotypy R. webbianum populations apparently are found in both diploid and tetraploid forms, having a chromosome count of 2n=22 or 2n=44. It is suspected that this infraspecific karyotypic diversity indicates the existence of one or more cryptic species, despite the different forms being phenotypically identical, because the polyploid forms would essentially be reproductively isolated. Similar species According to the 2003 key in the Flora of China, this species is distinguished from other entire-leaved rhubarbs in China with leaves having a wavy or crisped margin; R. wittrockii, R. rhabarbarum, R. australe and R. hotaoense, by having less than 1 cm-sized fruit, yellow-white flowers, and a wider than long leaf blade with a reniform-cordate to cordate shape. In many characters, it is most similar to R. rhabarbarum and R. hotaoense. Distribution This species is present in Pakistan (Gilgit-Baltistan, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa), India (Kashmir, Uttarakhand), western Nepal and southwest Tibet. Rheum webbianum habitus It is very common in the Himalayas. Ecology=Habitat In Pakistan it grows on slopes at an elevation of above sea level. In Tibet it is known from slopes at 3500-3600m elevation. In Nepal it grows at altitudes of 2400-4200m. In India it is known from elevations of 2400-4300m. Life cycle It flowers extending from June through September in Pakistan. It flowers June to July in India. It fruits August to September in Tibet. Local names In Pakistan it is known as chotal in the Gilgit region, and ishpar in the Chitral valley. An Urdu name is ravand chini. In Hindi it is called the following names: hind-revand-chini (Indian rhubarb), archa or atis. In Marathi it is known as ladakirevanda-chini. It is called padam chalnu in Nepal. In Chinese it is known as È°ªÂº•Â§ßÈªÑ, xu mi da huang. Uses Like Rheum australe, the roots of this species are harvested from the wild to make the drug Indian rhubarb; this was formerly an important drug in Western medicine, and is still used in Unani medicine. In Pakistan locals eat the leaf stalk cooked as in the West. The root is used as a purgative. In the Chitral valley the stems of the unripe inflorescence and leaf stalks are also eaten raw for the taste. Poor children collect the plant from the wild to sell in the market for money.

He gave the character a more authorial style, and a more Brazilian identity.  Career  Canini' first job was at age 21, for Rio Grande do Sul state's Secretary of Education and Culture, doing illustrations for the children's magazine Cacique. When the publication ceased, Canini kept doing engineering technical drawings until he completed ten years as a civil servant, a thing he despised. He also collaborated for the newspaper Correio do Povo, TV Piratini and alternative publications. In 1967 Canini was invited by a Methodist pastor (Rev. Willian Schisler Filho - Dico), to be an illustrator for the children's magazine Bem-Te-Vi, and moved to S√£o Paulo. Two years later, he got an opportunity to work for Editora Abril, first in the magazine Recreio, and then Disney comics.  Canini's Jos√© Carioca  In the beginning of the 1970s, Jos√© Carioca stories in Brazil were limited to reissues of 1940-1950 American- made strips, or adaptations of another characters' strips, like Mickey or Donald Duck. Canini, back to Porto Alegre, started to draw Jos√© Carioca's stories. Canini adapted the character to a more modern setting, changing the character's suit and bow tie for a T-shirt. Together with other artists and writers he helped bring the ambiance of the story to a perceived more authentic Brazilian context. But it was Canini's simple, loose and economical drawing style that departed his creations from Disney's standards. Canini's stories were not credited, but he always put his name in-story on background adverts and products. Canini drew Jos√© Carioca for five years, creating some 135 stories, some also written by himself, until publishers say that his drawing style was departing away too much from the Disney style, not selling as well as before and finally cancelling the production. Canini kept drawing comics, creating original characters like the cowboy Kaktus Kid, he psychiatrist Dr. Fraud, and the Brazilian native Tibica.

Built about 1880, it is the only surviving one-room schoolhouse in the rural community, and also served for a time as its town hall. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2013. Description and history The Marsh School is located in central Prospect, on the west side of Bangor Road (United States Route 1A) on the southern fringe of the town's dispersed rural village center, and in front of Maple Grove Cemetery, whose entrance lies just to the north. The school is a small single-story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, wooden clapboard siding, and a granite foundation. A small shed- roof addition projects from the rear of the southern side. The main facade, facing east, is three bays wide, with the entrance in the left bay, and sash windows in the other two bays and at the attic level. The north and west sides are characterized by bands of sash windows; the north side has a secondary entrance at its far western end. The interior of the main block has an entry hall and closet across the front, and a single large classroom, which still retains some original features. The addition, originally built to house a woodshed and privy, was probably rebuilt in the 1960s, and now houses a bathroom and furnace. This building as traditionally been given a construction date of 1836, but architectural styling and workmanship suggest it is more likely that it was built sometime after the American Civil War, with a possible reuse of older materials from an earlier building. With an estimated construction date of 1880, it would be the third schoolhouse built by the town, a function it served until 1963. During this time, it was also used as a polling place and site for town meetings. In 1961 the town consolidated its schools with neighboring Verona, and its other surviving district school was demolished. The present building, closed as a school in 1963, was refurbished with new floors and other alterations, and continued to be used for town offices and meetings for several decades. It now stands vacant.

The band have released four EPs and their debut album Very Rarely Say Die was released on 1 April 2016. They have toured throughout the UK, Ireland, Europe and the west coast of the US. Formation The seed of the band formed when drummer Jed Laidlaw was visiting a bar called Le Surfing, based at Estagnot beach near Hossegor, to visit a friend he had met whilst teaching surfing in the Canary Islands. That night, singer Rory Williams was performing in the bar, where he also worked washing dishes. He had moved there a year earlier on his way to Biarritz to surf. They hit it off and decided to start a band to make some money over the winter season, alongside friends Robin Windram (guitar) and Pete Harper (bass). They originally formed a covers band called The Cheerleaders, relocating to the French Alps for the winter to perform for the young snowboard crowd in the three valleys, basing themselves predominantly in the towns of Tignes and Val d‚ÄôIsere. After performing sometimes up to three shows a day in the various bars of the ski resorts, and becoming known for their raucous shows and unusual choices of songs, ranging from Queens of the Stone Age, to Kanye West, they decided to write their own material. On relocating back to Hossegor for the summer they changed their name to Sunset Sons and spent every Friday in a local dance studio writing songs. Laidlaw sent some demos to former Sony Music executive Steve Milbourne, who had been Laidlaw's label manager when he drummed in a previous band. Milbourne was looking for a new management project at the time. He flew to Hossegor to see them perform four songs in a tiny bar, and was impressed by the crowd's reaction. Milbourne helped them record their debut demo EP in a house they rented in Hossegor over the winter, with producer James Lewis. They named it Le Surfing, after the bar where they met. Le Surfing was self-released on 20 February 2014 and climbed to number 6 in the iTunes Rock Chart. This caught the attention of record companies and publishers. Milbourne was keen that the band be seen in their natural habitat, so arranged a tour of the French Alps, and a subsequent tour of surf towns in the UK, refusing to play any major cities. 2014‚Äìpresent In April 2014 the track \\"She Wants\\" gained the accolade of ‚ÄòNext Hype‚Äô from Zane Lowe, and was added to BBC Radio 1's ‚ÄòIntroducing‚Äô playlist. In June 2014 the band signed to Polydor Records, Vagrant Records and Kobalt Music. Summer 2014 saw them play on the BBC Introducing stage at Reading & Leeds festival amongst others. Their first official release, the No Bad Days EP (produced by James Lewis) was released on 28 October 2014. It went to #1 in the iTunes Rock Chart, and lead track \\"Remember\\" was added to BBC Radio 1's ‚ÄòIn New Music We Trust‚Äô playlist. In January 2015, the band were nominated for the BBC Sound of 2015 and MTV Brand New 2015 and were named #1 XFM's Great X-Pectations for 2015. At this time the band played a sold-out show at Hoxton Bar & Kitchen, London, and received a four star live review in The Times newspaper. This was followed by a sold out UK tour in February/March. Their second official release, The Fall Line EP (produced by Catherine Marks) was released on March 9, 2015. It went to #1 in the iTunes Rock Chart, and lead track \\"Medicine\\" was BBC Radio 1's track of the day and added to the ‚ÄôC-List‚Äô. In March 2015 the band went to Nashville to begin recording their debut album with producer Jacquire King (Kings of Leon, Tom Waits, Of Monsters and Men). The band performed another sold out UK tour in April 2015, including London Scala. In summer 2015 the band performed at Glastonbury Festival (John Peel Stage), earning a side of stage visit from Michael Eavis. They also performed at Isle of Wight Festival, T in The Park, Boardmasters, and Reading & Leeds, as well as major festivals across Europe including Hurricane, Southside, Arenal Festival. Their third EP release, She Wants (produced by Catherine Marks and Jacquire King), was released on 23 July 2015. The lead track was a re-recording of \\"She Wants\\" from their original demo EP. The track was named Radio 1's \\"Track of the Day\\". On 9 August 2015, the band said they were re-working their debut album, admitting that they got some of the tracks back from their time in Nashville and they could have been better, and that they would re-record certain things with an aim to finish it by end of summer 2015. In October 2015 the band joined Imagine Dragons as the main support for their European arena tour, covering 35 dates through Germany, France, Belgium, United Kingdom, Ireland, Spain, The Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, Italy and Switzerland. The band said it was a 'massive compliment' to be asked. On 8 October 2015 the band headlined the music segment of the World Surf League event Quiksilver Pro France. Their tracks \\"Blondie\\" and \\"Come Easy\\" were used as the highlight background music for the event. They released a single, \\"On The Road\\" (produced by Jacquire King, a re-recording of the original demo), on 16 October 2015 through the French Exit label, to support the Imagine Dragons tour. In January 2016 the band announced their debut album, Very Rarely Say Die, to be released on 1 April 2016. On 18 April 2016 the band headlined surf and music festival Goldcoast Oceanfest in Croyde, Devon. In August 2016 it was announced the band had been nominated for Best Live Act at the 2016 AIM (Association of Independent Music) Awards, alongside Wolf Alice, Babymetal, Caravan Palace and Courteeners. In January 2018 it was announced guitarist Robin Windram had left the band to concentrate on his family. At the same time the band announced they had been in the studio with producer Catherine Marks, an EP The River was released in 2018 and the band supported Nothing But Thieves on their UK tour. In August 2019 the band announced their second album Blood Rush D√©j√† Vu, also produced by Catherine Marks, would be released on 1 November 2019 with a UK headline tour to follow. Their songs \\"Remember\\" and \\"Medicine\\" are included in the video game Guitar Hero Live. The band appeared on a BBC Radio 1 show on 27 October 2015 to talk about music video games. In an interview with The Sound Lab in November 2019, the band stated they would be touring extensively and performing at as many festivals in the summer as possible. They also stated that new music would not be too far away, with shorter periods between new releases than with previous singles.

Constructed in the Dravidian style of architecture, the temple is believed to have been expanded during the 18th century with the images excavated from Kalugumalai. The core temple has a rock-cut architecture exemplary of early Pandyan Art. The other portions of Kalugumalai houses the 8th century Kalugumalai Jain Beds and Vettuvan Koil, an unfinished Shiva temple. The temple has a gateway leading to a pillared hall and the sanctum. The temple is open from 5:30 am ‚Äì 12:30 pm and 4:30 - 9 pm. Four daily rituals and many yearly festivals are held at the temple, of which the ten-day Vaikasi Visagam, 13-day Kanthasasti festival, ten-day Thaipoosam festival and the 13-day Panguni Uthiram festival being the most prominent. The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu. Legend Sculpture on the ceiling of the temple As per Hindu legend, the temple is associated with the period of Ramayana. Ravana, the demon king, while abducting Sita, the consort of Rama, killed Jatayu, the eagle. Rama did the final rites for Jatayu, who informed Rama about the abduction before his life ended. Jatayu's brother Sambathi, who was also called Kazhugumahamunivar, was worried about the repercussions of him not doing his karma, the final rites of his brother. Rama advised him to do his penance at Gajamukaparvatham and taking holy dip in the tank. Ages passed by and the time arrived when Muruga was pursuing to slay Surapadman, another demon. Tharukasuran, the brother of Surapadman, was troubling the sages in the region. Murugan slayed Tharukasuran and was resting at Kazhugumalai. Sambathi was assisting Murugan and he also indicated the hideout of Surapadman, whom Murugan slayed subsequently. Pleased with his devotion, Murugan gave salvation. The place came to be known as Kazhugumalai since the sage Kazhugumahamunivar resided here. Architecture The temple is located in Kalugumalai, a rockyhill in Thoothukudi district in southern Tamil Nadu. The sanctum of the temple is approached through a pillared hall near the gateway. The temple tank is located outside the temple. The sanctum is built in a rock- cut cave, which houses the image of Murugan in the form of Kazhugachalamurthi in seated posture. The sanctum faces West and the image of the presiding deity is tall. The image is sported with six hands with one of them holding Vel (divine spear), his left leg over the shoulder of the peacock and right is left hanging. There are separate shrines of his consorts Valli facing South and Deivanai facing North. There is a separate shrine for Shiva and Parvathi and all the Parsvatah Devatas (attendant deities) associated with Shiva temples. Usually in Murugan temples, his vehicle peacock would be heading towards his right, but it is sported on to the left of Murugan in this temple. It is believed that Indra, the king of celestial deities, appeared as peacock to worship Murugan. The image of the peacock is hence covered during the festivals. The other portions of Kalugumalai houses the 8th century Kalugumalai Jain Beds and Vettuvan Koil, an unfinished Shiva temple. History and religious significance Image of the temple tank The images of the presiding deity was excavated from the Southwestern corner of Kalugumalai. The images were installed and the leading pillared halls were constructed during the 18th century. The temple finds mention in Kanthapuranam, a work by Kachiappar. Kachiappar mentions that there are only three sacred temples of Murugan where he faces the South and this is the only temple where he faces south and also in seated posture. The temple was under the control of Ettaiyapuram Zamindar under 1954. The Raja gifted the village to the temple and formed five streets around the temple to enable the temple car to pass easily. He also allocated a middle street for the temple priests. During the Panguni Uthiram festival procession, the elongated conflict between two castes in the region, namely, Nadars and Maravars resulted in a riots, popularly called Kalugumalai riots of 1895. A total of ten people were killed, many injured and the temple car and other property in the region were destroyed. In modern times, the temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu. Festival The temple priests perform the pooja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. There are weekly, monthly and fortnightly rituals performed in the temple. The temple is open from 5:30 am ‚Äì 12:30 pm and 6 - 9 pm on all days except during festive occasions when it has extended timings. The major festivals of the temple include the ten-day Vaikasi Visagam celebrated during the Tamil month of Vaikasi (May - June), 13 day Kanthasasti festival, Ten day Thaipoosam festival celebrated during the Tamil month of Thai (January - February) and the 13 day Panguni Uthiram festival during Panguni (March - April). Kalugumalai was chosen in the plan to be included as a rural tourism site in Incredible India campaign by the Tourism Ministry of the Government of India. As a part of the campaign the ministry allocated 10 million to develop the infrastructure around the region in 2008. The tourist inflow to the town increased to 3,000 persons per month during 2009 from 400 per month during the previous years.

It is located on the southern edge of Brockwell Park. It comprises 306 dwellings, a mixture of four, three and two-bedroom houses, and one-bedroom apartments. It was designed at the end of the 1960s by the Lambeth Borough Council Architect Edward Hollamby and second architect Roger Westman, and built at the start of the 1970s. In 2012 Lambeth Council proposed demolishing the estate, to replace the terraced houses by apartment blocks. Most of the apartments would then be for sale to the private sector. The residents, those in Lambeth who wish to prevent the gentrification of the borough, and those who want to conserve what they believe to be important architectural heritage, are campaigning to prevent its demolition. Its design was inspired by the social reformers who advocated, and showed the benefit of providing houses with gardens for those who can only afford to rent. It was a reaction to the failure of council estates of multi-storey apartment blocks to provide a good family homes. Westman and Hollamby's innovative design showed how it was possible using low rise dwellings, to achieve the same residential density as estate of multi- storey apartment blocks; and how pedestrianizing the estate allowed much better use of the space between the dwellings, as this space could be used for gardens rather than car parks and access roads.  History  The 1969 Lambeth Council was controlled by the Conservative Party. The Conservatives, at that time, believed that the council should provide homes for all those who could not afford to buy a house. In inner London, in the 1950s and 1960s, estates with multi-storey apartment blocks provided the dominant architectural model for council housing. The seminal study Family and Kinship in East London showed that such apartments did not prove as satisfactory a family home as a house with a garden. By the 1970s many councils were returning to building houses, rather than multi-storey apartment blocks, and Lambeth Council was a leader in this trend. As Borough Architect, Ted Hollamby had designed different types of council dwellings, tower blocks, tenements, houses. He 'passionately believed that council housing should be as good, if not better than private housing'. His design for Cressingham Gardens was informed by failure of multi-storey tower blocks to provide good family homes. He was also aware of the importance of gardens in enhancing the quality of life of the residents of a dwelling, His design for Cressingham Gardens ensured 'every home its splash of greenery and colour'. In recognizing the importance of gardens, he was following an English tradition of the garden city and garden suburbs. In 1969 Ted Hollamby submitted his team's design for Cressingham Gardens to the Housing Committee. The deputy chairman of the housing committee was Sir John Major. The committee recognized the exceptional importance of the innovative design and minuted 'congratulations to Cressingham‚Äôs architects on their ‚Äòbold and imaginative scheme'. The initial contract for the building estate was for ¬£1.58 million, or approximately ¬£5,500 per dwelling. If the retail price index is used to convert to 2015 prices the costs are: ¬£24 million for the build, with a cost per dwelling of ¬£80,000. The building of Cressingham Gardens was interrupted by a national building strike, and the contractors terminated the contract. In 1970 Lambeth Council became Labour controlled. To complete the estate, the new housing committee, on the advice of Ken Livingstone, who was deputy chairman, authorized the use direct labour. Building the three hundred dwellings took seven years.  Urban design innovations  The estate is built at very high residential density, over 250 persons/hectare (100/ acre). In order to provide this residential density in an estate of low rise dwellings, rather than an estate of multi-storey apartment blocks, Roger Westman had to produce a number of urban design innovations. ;Underground car park on edge of the estate:The car park for Cressingham Gardens is on the edge of the estate next to the main road. This means that cars do not enter the estate. The car park is underneath a tenement block, consequently no residential land area is for the use of cars. At the time, the standard urban design practice was to provide garages in the centre of an estate. This makes inefficient use of residential land area, as roads and pavements are needed throughout an estate. ;Front doors open onto pedestrian only area:In Cressingham Gardens the front doors of dwellings open on to pedestrian only avenues and pathways. This allows efficient use of residential land area, as pathways can be much narrower than roads with pavements. Experience has shown that there are substantial social benefits from having front doors open onto a pedestrian area. The most important of these is that the pedestrianized space provides a safe play area for small children. ;Small front gardens:Tenant maintained frontageRoger Westman designed the small front garden area of dwellings on the estate, in some cases no more than a flower pot on a railing. The occupier of a dwelling controls this garden frontage; and although the plot is tiny, many of the residents have been able create great garden displays. :In a council estate of multi- storey apartment blocks the frontage is normally maintained by a management company, appointed by the council, not the residents, and where there are gardens, key access is required, which means they are infrequently used. :Having a very small front garden frontage makes efficient use on residential land, as the distance between the rows of terrace houses can be reduced to a few metres. This could have led to gloomy narrow alleyways, but Ted Hollamby avoided this by specifying low pitched factory style roofs for the terraced houses. ;Small back gardens:Westman also mades ure that each house on the estate had a (very) small back garden. Again this allows for efficient use of residential land. It is advantageous as it encourages the resident of a house to use the garden space efficiently. In the long thin back gardens, common on London estates, the land at the back is often unused, or used as scrap heap. In high latitudes, back gardens can contribute to the healthy development of pre-school children. Children can suffer from not spending sufficient time outside as sun light is needed to make vitamin D. Inadequate vitamin D leads to poor bone development and rickets. The housing crisis in London has led to an increasing number families living in apartments with no access to out door play areas for children. It is therefore unsurprising that rickets has returned.  Design failings  Lambeth Council give design failings, and the expense of bringing the estate up to modern standards, as the justification for its planned demolition. These failings are said to be a consequence of the innovative design for the estate, but the consequence only occurs as a result of the negligence of the council to do necessary maintenance. In particular, rather than repairing and refurbishing six homes imperilled by a single incidence of subsidence, they were been bricked up in 1999 and left vacant ever since. The council-appointed consulting structural engineers identified the following problems: ;Poor thermal insulation:The late 1960s was age of cheap energy, consequently the dwellings on the estate were not designed to be energy efficient. Some gains have been made through estate-wide programmes to install cavity wall insulation and double-glazed window units. There is a particular problem with the roofs. In order to allow light into the four metre wide pathways between rows of terraces, the roof lines are low, and there are no lofts. This makes upgrading the roof installation more costly than the same job on a standard house. ;High maintenance guttering scheme:To simplify the drainage of the pathways and avenues, Ted Hollamby did not use the standard design of external guttering for the roofs, with multiple drain pipes along a terrace. Instead he designed gutters which were integral with the roof leading to one drain pipe at the end of the terrace. This simplified land drainage of the paths and avenues. Supposedly the maintenance costs for this scheme are higher than for traditional guttering methods, but this has not been proven, and integral guttering used in Europe and the US over the last half century does not carry a maintenance premium over and above conventional guttering. Ted Hollamby did not foresee the abolition of property taxes, and shrinking of the council tax base, and the sale of council houses and reduction in the council rental income. The consequential reduction in the council maintenance budgets, has meant that the requirement to clear the gutters frequently, has not been fulfilled. On a number of occasions the gutters have got blocked and overflowed, which has let to damage to some of the brickwork. ;Inadequate land drainage:The water from the gutters overflows on to the avenues and pathways of the estate. The land drains for these were not designed to cope with the unexpected flow. This has led to water penetration and some structural damage to some of the buildings on the estate.  Successful design features  Although the estate has not always been properly maintained, it has enabled a high quality of life for its residents. Ted Hollamby wanted to ensure that design of the estate led to a community developing, In this he was successful. 'Overwhelmingly, residents talk of their friendly neighbours and the estate‚Äôs strong sense of community ‚Äì they look out for each other, keep an eye on each other‚Äôs children'. The social mix of residents in Cressingham Gardens is the same as in the sink estates of Lambeth. The probable cause of the community spirit is that the pedestrianized avenues of the estate provide an area for friendly, neighbourly social interactions. It is these social interactions have led to a mutually supportive community amongst the ethnically and socially diverse residents on the estate. The good indication of mutual cooperation between those on the estate is seen in the YouTube video they produced as part of their campaign to save their estate, their homes, and their community. There are three areas where its innovative urban design has resulted in improvement over an estate of multi-storey apartment blocks. ;Reduced crime:Ted Hollamby insisted that kitchen windows overlooked the pathways and avenues of the estate, and that front doors faced each other across the avenues. This is a far more effective anti crime measure than CCTV cameras, and prefigured the now ubiquitous \\"Safer by Design\\" strategies of urban architects and planners. In a multi-storey apartment block, unobserved corridors, walkways, and stairwells can create a high crime area. This was illustrated by the crime rate on the Broadwater Farm estate. However, regeneration, which eliminated the unobserved stairwells and walkways, transformed the estate into a low crime area. ;Reduced traffic:Ted Hollamby's placing of the underground car park beside the road and not in the estate provides the public good of reduced traffic. As car owning residents always have to walk, at least to the car park, they will always consider completing the trip on foot, bike or public transport. When the car is outside the front door there is a natural tendency to make car the first choice for any journey, and this generates traffic. ;Supportive neighbourhood community:Pedestrianisation has promoted social contact between neighbours and this has let to mutually supportive community developing. This is also a public good, as neighbours can help each other out, reducing the demand for child care services, health care service, and social services.  Redevelopment plans  Lambeth Council have stated that it would cost ¬£9.4 million (¬£30,000 per dwelling) to fix the structural defects on the estate. They further state that the ¬£30,000 per dwelling to do the necessary repairs is three times what they can afford. Instead they are proposing to redevelop the site in partnership with a property developer. The developer would pay for the site by agreeing to build apartments for social housing. Creating the vacant building plot required, will entail, demolishing all the dwellings, bulldozing the gardens and felling the trees on the site. On the cleared site multi-storey apartment blocks would be built. There will be more dwellings, 464 apartments will replace 306 houses, and apartments; but new development will be mostly one and two bedroom apartments, there will be no four bedroom houses with gardens. Hence the residential density in terms of bedrooms per hectare will approximately the same. A minority of the new dwellings will be for rent, the aspiration is 40%, the majority will be for sale to private buyers. What makes it profitable for a property developer to knock down 306 council houses and build 190 new apartments to replace them, is that he can sell 274 apartments. The site is a prime location. It has direct access to Brockwell Park and good transport links with Gatwick Airport and St Pancras International. In such a location a developer could plan on selling a two bedroom apartment for between half and three quarters of a million pounds. In a similar scheme in at the Heygate Estate, Elephant and Castle, a one bedroom apartment sells for ¬£569,000, and a two bedroom apartment for ¬£801,000. The apartments for sale in the redeveloped Cressingham Gardens will not be affordable for the vast majority of people who work for a living in London. The median earned annual income in London is ¬£34,000. This means an apartment in the redeveloped Cressingham Gardens would be for sale at nearly fifteen times median earned income. From the sale of 274 apartments the developer could plan on a revenue of over ¬£137 million. Provided the apartments can be built for less than ¬£300,000 each, a profit can be made. It would seem, that because the council cannot afford ¬£30,000 for repairing and refurbishing a property, a property developer has to be brought in, resulting in an initial loss of 306 dwellings built for letting at an affordable rent, and a permanent loss of over hundred such dwellings.  Gated development  In order for the maximum value of the site to be realised, the proposed development will be a gated community. There is now a generic design for such developments. The apartments for private sale are in a tower block on top of a car park. Entrance to the car park is through a barred gate, managed remotely by a security company. This was the standard design on display at the MIPIM property fair. The block for social housing has a separate entrance, which will tend to prevent social interaction between private owners and social housing tenants. The redevelopment controversy  Lambeth Council claim that the plan to demolish council houses is to enable more council dwellings to be built. They say that 'London is faced with the greatest housing crisis since the Second World War', They also say that they are paying for 1,800 families to live in temporary accommodation, they have on their books 1,300 families living in severely overcrowded conditions, and 20,000, families on their waiting list. Lambeth Council say that inaction is not an option, and that in contribution to solving the housing crisis they are committed to proving a thousand new dwellings at council rent levels over the next four years. The council say they could achieve this objective through a process of estate regeneration (sic). It is not clear if the proposed 1,000 new dwellings will provide a net increase in dwellings available in Lambeth at council rent levels. There are many people in council dwellings, in Brixton, Lambeth Walk, and Stockwell who do not trust the council, they fear that the council is engaged in a policy of gentrification, and the real aim of the redevelopment is to increase property values in the borough, to the benefit of owner occupiers in Herne Hill, West Dulwich, and Streatham. Those renting from the council fear that tenants who lose their homes in redevelopment projects will be relocated out of the borough, and building the new dwellings to allow them to return, will be delayed indefinitely. The families in Cressingham Gardens fear that when they are evicted from their house with a garden, the alternative accommodation offered will be an apartment in a tower block on a sink estate, a possibility not precluded by the Council's 'Tenants - Key guarantees' document. The overwhelming majority of residents on the estate fear that they will lose the friendly and helpful neighbours and the benefit of living in mutually supportive community.  Judicial review  On 17 July 2015 the high court ruled that Eva Bokrosova's request for judicial review of Lambeth Council decision to only consider options for demolishing Cressingham Gardens. The court was told that Lambeth Council originally consulted on five options: * Option 1 - Refurbishing the estate and bringing all council tenant homes up to decent homes standard, including the six void flats that have stood empty for over 16 years; * Option 2 and 3 - Refurbishing as in Option 1, plus infilling to create new homes. * Option 4 - Partial demolition of the estate, with the net extra in new build homes sold at top market price * Option 5 - Full demolition and rebuilding of the estate At the High Court Mr Justice Holman granted permission to allow Ms Bokrosova to challenge Lambeth Council‚Äôs decision to ‚Äòabruptly close down‚Äô consultation on options 1-3, options which were strongly supported by residents. On November 24 Mrs Justice Elisabeth Laing ruled that the decision to remove options 1, 2 and 3 from the consultation was unlawful.  The case for listed status  Cressingham Gardens is shown in Open House London. This is billed as London's greatest architectural festival, on which great architecture from all periods is on display for free. On a tour of the estate were those interested in great architecture. They were told that an application had been made for Cressingham Gardens to be granted listed status, and the application had been unsuccessful. Tour members were astonished as they had seen buildings which had been given listed status, which were of far less merit than Cressingham Gardens. Their view was that a strong case could, and should be made for giving Cressingham Gardens listed status, and backing obtained for the application from those with influence. Listed building status is granted under two headings: Historical interest and important architectural model. The case is that Cressingham Gardens deserves listing under both categories.  Historical importance  Social reforming English urban planners have recognized the importance of providing houses with gardens to families who rent their homes. Cadbury's homes in Bournville were the first. The most influential was Sir Ebenezer Howard with his proposal for Garden cities, which provided the model for Welwyn Garden City and the post war new towns. The most idealistic were the Barnetts in their design for Hampstead Garden Suburb. In all these places the original buildings had to be given listed status to prevent them being demolished by property developers and replaced by apartment blocks. There is an arguable case that innovation of building houses, intended for rent, with very small gardens, in a pedestrianized estate, so that a high residential density can be achieved, is as important an historical advance as the innovations of the garden city movement, and Cressingham Gardens should be given listed status to preserve the first instance of this important innovation in urban design.  Architectural model  The combination of Roger Westman's urban design innovations in Cressingham Gardens created an architectural model, the Council garden estate, a pedestrianized estate of houses with gardens, in which all the properties are let at council rent levels. As a pioneer of green architecture, Westman wished for more green spaces in London's maily concrete social housing projects. This has since become an important model for inner city housing, as the model allows very high residential densities, and it has been shown to enable a high quality of life for residents.

The enhanced signal-to-noise ratio becomes obvious while an impulse-like signal (3) becomes directly evident in the HFIM picture whereas it is not visible in the 2-dimensional diagram. HFIM, acronym for high- frequency-impulse-measurement, is a type of measurement technique in acoustics, where structure-borne sound signals are detected and processed with certain emphasis on short-lived signals as they are indicative for crack formation in a solid body, mostly steel. The basic idea is to use mathematical signal processing methods such as Fourier analysis in combination with suitable computer hardware to allow for real-time measurements of acoustic signal amplitudes as well as their distribution in frequency space. The main benefit of this technique is the enhanced signal-to-noise ratio when it comes to the separation of acoustic emission from a certain source and other, unwanted contamination by any kinds of noise. The technique is therefore mostly applied in industrial production processes, e.g. cold forming or machining, where a 100 percent quality control is required or in condition monitoring for e.g. quantifying tool wear.  Physical basics  High- frequency-impulse measurement is an algorithm for obtaining frequency information of any structure- or air-borne sound source on the basis of discrete signal transformations. This is mostly done using [Fourier series] to quantify the distribution of the energy content of a sound signal in frequency space. On the software side, the tool used for this is the fast Fourier transform (FFT) implementation of this mathematical transformation. This allows, in combination with specific hardware, to directly obtain frequency information so that this is accessible in-line, e.g. during a production process. Contrary to classical, off-line frequency analysis methods, the signal is not unfolded before transformation but is directly fed into the FFT computation. Single events, such as cracks, are hence depicted as extremely short-lived signals covering the entire frequency range (the Fourier transform of a single impulse is a signal covering the entire observed frequency space). Therefore, such single events are easily separable from other noises, even if they are much more energetic.  Applications  Because of its in-line capabilities, HFIM is mostly applied in industrial production processes when it comes to high quality standards e.g. for auto parts that are relevant for crash behavior of a car: * Cold forming: In cold forming applications, HFIM is mostly used to detect cracks during the forming process. Since such cracks are vastly due to stress in the manufactured part, the spontaneous formation of a crack is accompanied by a very sharp, impulse-like signal in the HFIM process landscape which can easily be separated from other noise. Therefore, HFIM is the standard technology for crack detection in the automotive sector all over the world. * Machining: In many machining applications, HFIM is used to either monitor the status of tool wear and hence enable pedicitive maintenance or to prevent chatter. * Plastic injection molding: Here, HFIM is used to monitor the status of the molds which are usually very complex. In particular, breaking off of small pins or other parts of the mold can be detected in-line. * Welding: In contrast to most classical monitoring systems for the welding process which usually measure currents or voltages on the welding device, HFIM measures the energy acting directly on the welded workpiece. That allows for detection of various weld imperfactions such as burn-through. There are also several applications of HFIM devices in materials science laboratories where the exact timing of crack formation is relevant, for instance when determining the plasticity of a new kind of steel.

In 1887, Walls was president of Middlesbrough Trades Council. In 1887, William Snow, secretary of the blastfurnacemen's union in Cumberland, was incapacitated through illness, and Walls travelled to Workington in an attempt to resolve a dispute there. Following a fall in the price of iron, local employers had cut wages. Walls believed that the price of iron would quickly recover, and recommended that trade unionists accept a deal where they would receive a 5% reduction in pay if it did not recover, but no reduction if it did. As he hoped, the price rebounded within a week, and wages were restored to their earlier level. Following this success, the Cumberland blastfurnacemen joined with those of Cleveland to form a new National Union of Blastfurnacemen, and Walls led negotiations which agreed an eight-hour working day in 1890.

The territory is divided into 32 parishes and in 2011 there were 35,000 Lebanese Maronite Catholics. History Until the eighteenth century the Maronite Patriarchate was formally divided into eparchies: in fact the bishops were all considered as auxiliary of the Patriarch, the only true leader of the Maronite nation. The bishops of Laodicea, like other Maronite bishops, in fact, had only the title of their home, and pursues not any real jurisdiction and do not even have a place to reside. The Synod of Mount Lebanon in 1736, which at the request of Propaganda Fide decided the canonical erection of the Maronite diocese, gave no consideration to Laodicea, which therefore continued to be the seat of a titular bishop. The territories that were formally part of Laodicea were subdued by the synod of authority of the Tripoli Eparchs.

Having lived in Serbia, Bosnia and Dalmatia, he composed numerous tunes in Serbian folk (\\"Stani, stani Ibar vodo\\"), Bosnian Sevdalinka (\\"U lijepom starom gradu Vi≈°egradu\\") and Dalmatian (\\"Kad si bila mala, Mare\\") popular styles. He composed several hundred songs, and many of them remain popular standards to this day, although Nedoviƒá's authorship is not universally known. Biography Dragi≈°a Nedoviƒá was born on 20 July 1916 in Kragujevac, in central Serbia. His parents, Andrija and Gina, had nine children ‚Äî five sons and three daughters, three of whom having died early. As the family was poor, Nedoviƒá left his home in 1932 as a 16-year-old and worked as a traveling musician across Serbia, Bosnia, and Dalmatia. Self-taught but talented, he was quick to adapt to local styles and created numerous tunes, which quickly became popular and picked up by other orchestras. As he did not make recordings or published the songs through recording houses, his authorship of many of those songs was often forgotten and revealed only later, through research. To this day, many of them are considered \\"traditional\\" in the eyes of the general public. After years of roaming, he returned to his hometown Kragujevac and continued writing. A man of inspiration, he would inscribe lyrics as they came to him, on paper notes, envelopes or handkerchiefs. During the German occupation of Serbia in World War II, Nedoviƒá was arrested along with many citizens in the Kragujevac massacre on 21 October 1941. However, he was spared as a famous writer and deported into the Dormagen detention camp in Germany, where he would spend the rest of the war. When he returned from the detention, he found that most of his lyrics were lost. Undeterred, he continued on songwriting. With several fellow composers, he formed the \\"First union of composers and writers of songs and dances with popular motives\\". Nedoviƒá's health, however, worsened, as he contracted tuberculosis in 1950. As an homage to the disease, he wrote the song Pluƒáa su mi bolna, zdravlja vi≈°e nemam ('My Lungs Hurt, My Health Has Gone'), performed by Zaim Imamoviƒá. It got soon banned for public performance, as it allegedly caused several suicides by people suffering from the then-incurable disease. However, Nedoviƒá was saved by peniciline treatment, only to discover that he had a severe heart condition as well. Nedoviƒá died from a heart attack in his hometown Kragujevac on 31 January 1966. He is buried in the city cemetery, in a common grave with his two brothers Dragoljub and Lazar, both of them died relatively young. He had two children, son Aleksandar and daughter Rada.

The Centre aims to address contemporary social issues of public interest, carrying out authoritative, research on central social issues which draws upon interdisciplinary expertise in economics, politics and sociology and related disciplines such as social policy. A particular focus is on examining social progress in Britain and to this aim, the Centre has undertaken research covering topics including crime, education, social capital, life expectancy, corruption, food insecurity and Beveridge‚Äôs ‚Äòfive giants‚Äô. The Centre also undertakes research on inequalities, including those relating to gender, ethnicity and class. The Centre has a strong emphasis on interdisciplinary work and rigorous methods, ranging from quantitative research to field experiments. It has undertaken collaborative work with the UK Department for Communities and Local Government. CSI's research is independent and non-partisan; as such, it has no political affiliation or leaning. The Centre is counselled by an advisory board whose members work in research, policy and the private sector. Unusually for an academic research group, the Centre has a strong emphasis on engaging and disseminating its research beyond traditional academic outputs to communicate the results of its activities in an accessible way to non- technical audiences, including policy-makers and the public more generally.

Biography He was born on 6 October 1955 in Pula, in an Istro-Romanian family originating from an unspecified village on the ƒÜiƒáarija hill. He graduated from Pula Technical School, and from 1978 till death he worked at Uljanik Electric Machines and Equipment Factory (TESU), where he eventually became a head of a department; he was a trade-union representative for the Trade Unions of Istria, Kvarner and Dalmatia, and he actively organized and participated in workers‚Äô protests. He joined KUD Idijoti in 1985, four years after the band's formation, and due to his charisma, stage persona and sincere anti-fascist convictions he soon became one of the best known and most important punk singers in former Yugoslavia. He participated in numerous concerts throughout former Yugoslavia and abroad. His last performance took place in Zeleni gaj in Slovenia, on 26 February 2011.

Director Andrej Korovljev is in the process of making a documentary about Tusta's life and work. Quotations * Hundreds of examples have made me even more convinced that the title of the album \\"Stupidity is Indestructible\\" was perfectly correct. It is just that, in the meantime, I have become more tolerant towards stupidity and I accept it as a part of human existence. People have the right to be stupid, it cannot be abolished by decree. Aside from that, there are worse things: egoism, malice, sadism, terrorism, for example, it‚Äôs quite a long list... It doesn‚Äôt mean there are no smart people, good ideas, ingenious deeds and healthy things in this world. There are, of course, but when it comes to stupidity ‚Äì it is something very hard to uproot. * I have come to the realisation that political change can only be achieved by political means and political work, not by singing. Each activity has its own implements. You plough with a plough, you fight a war with a gun, you carry out restrictions with laws. Songs against war do not stop wars, singing about poverty doesn‚Äôt enrich the poor (perhaps the author of the song, ha, ha), songs about corruption do not prevent corruption. So, what do songs resolve? Nothing, for the most part.

Biography  Abu Torab's father was Mirza Morteza, who was a former court official, and his mother was a daughter of the former Safavid king (shah) Sultan Husayn (r. 1694-1722). On May 1750, the Chahar Lang chieftain Ali Mardan Khan Bakhtiari and the Zand chieftain Karim Khan stormed the gates of Isfahan‚Äîits governor Abu'l-Fath Khan Bakhtiari and other prominent residents assembled to protect the fortress of the city, but agreed to surrender and collaborate with them after Ali Mardan's reasonable proposals.

Life Se√±aris was born in 1965 and she obtained a degree in biology at the Central University of Venezuela and her doctorate in 2001 at the University of Santiago de Compostela in Spain. She is interested in the fauna of Venezuela, in particular the Guayana Region where table-top mountains called tepuis provide habitats for endemic plant and animal species: some amphibians are known only from a single tepuy.

Prior to his election in 2015, Wecht had served on the Superior Court of Pennsylvania since 2011, when he was elected to a 10-year term. Early life and education He was born in Baltimore, Maryland, on May 20, 1962. Wecht is the son of Cyril Wecht, a nationally-recognized pathologist and former Allegheny County medical examiner, known for famously disagreeing with the single-bullet theory in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. His mother spent the first six years of her life living under Nazi occupation in Norway. Wecht graduated from the Shady Side Academy in 1980. He then attended Yale College, where he was elected to the Phi Beta Kappa Society and graduated with the distinction summa cum laude for his studies in history and political science in 1984. Wecht then attended Yale Law School where he served on the Yale Law Journal and graduated in 1987. He clerked for federal judge George MacKinnon in Washington, D.C. and worked as an associate at Williams & Connolly. Career Before his election to the Superior Court in 2011, Wecht served in Allegheny County government, holding elected executive and judicial offices since 1998. Wecht served as Allegheny County's elected register of wills and clerk of orphans' court from 1998 to 2003, and then trial judge from February 2003 until January 2012, working extensively in the civil and family divisions. From 2009 to 2011, he served an administrative judge of the Family Division, where he was credited for implementing several reforms, including a conflict counsel program for juvenile delinquency cases, and a unified family court, in which the same jurist guides a family through its entire experience with the court. Wecht ran as a Democrat for Pennsylvania Supreme Court in 2015, and was part of a Democratic sweep of all three court vacancies, along with Kevin Dougherty and Christine Donohue. They defeated Republican candidates Judith Olsen, Michael George, and Anne Covey in a campaign that has been described by media outlets and advocacy groups as the \\"most expensive judicial election in U.S. history\\". Wecht campaigned on a \\"five-point plan\\" to improve transparency and ethical standards in the Pennsylvania judiciary, calling for a ban on nepotism and gifts to judges, \\"mandatory ethics training\\" for judges, a requirement that judges state for the record why they are recusing themselves from a case, and the implementation of cameras in the courtroom except in the cases of child abuse and juvenile cases. In August 2018, Wecht partially concurred when the majority found that the criminal conviction of a rapper for making a song entitled \\"Fuck the Police\\" did not violate the First Amendment to the United States Constitution because the song was found to contain true threats..

HMS Oakham Castle was a Royal Navy corvette of the Castle class. Built as a convoy escort during the Second World War, it later became a weather ship before being scrapped in 1977. Design and construction The Castle-class corvettes were an improved and enlarged derivative of the earlier Flower-class corvettes, which was intended to be built by shipyards that could not build the larger and more capable frigates. The greater length of the Castles gave made them better seaboats than the Flowers, which were not originally designed for ocean escort work. Large numbers (96 in total) were ordered in late 1942 and early 1943 from shipyards in the United Kingdom and Canada, but Allied successes in the Battle of the Atlantic meant that the requirement for escorts was reduced, and many ships (including all the Canadian ones) were cancelled. The Castles were long overall, at the waterline and between perpendiculars. Beam was and draught was aft at full load. Displacement was about standard and full load. Two Admiralty Three-drum water tube boilers fed steam to a Vertical Triple Expansion Engine rated at which drove a single propeller shaft. This gave a speed of . 480 tons of oil were carried, giving a range of at . The ships had a main gun armament of a single QF 4-inch Mk XIX dual-purpose gun, backed up by two twin and two single Oerlikon 20 mm cannon. Anti-submarine armament consisted of a single triple-barrelled Squid anti-submarine mortar with 81 charges backed up by two depth charge throwers and a single depth charge rail, with 15 depth charges carried. Type 272 or Type 277 surface search radar was fitted, as was high- frequency direction finding (HF/DF) gear. The ships' sonar outfit was Type 145 and Type 147B. Oakham Castle was one of 13 Castle-class corvettes ordered on 19 December 1942. The ship was laid down at A & J Inglis's Glasgow shipyard on 30 November 1943, launched on 20 July 1944, and completed on 10 December 1944. Career On entering service, Oakham Castle was employed on convoy escort duty in the North Atlantic. In 1948, Oakham Castle joined the 2nd Training Squadron based at Portland Harbour, continuing to serve in this duty until December 1950, when she was reduced to reserve at Devonport. Oakham Castle was refitted in 1953, and then was laid up in a preserved condition at South Shields. The ship was transferred to the Met Office in 1957, and was converted to a Weather ship by James Lamont & Co. at Greenock. On 16 May 1958 the ship was renamed Weather Reporter by Lord Hurcomb.

Maine Department of Internal Fisheries and Wildlife. Retrieved November 3, 2015. largely undeveloped lake located entirely in the town of Woolwich, Maine. Geography Nequasset is a coastal warm-water lake. The shore of the lake is mostly rocky, with multiple sand beaches scattered in coves across the lake. The largest of these beaches is located on the north shore, often referred to as \\"Sandy Beach\\" by locals. Multiple rocky points can be found along the shoreline, with at least one small rock island located along the eastern shore. Although the lake's deepest point is , the vast majority of the lake does not reach this depth. The southern end of the lake averages deep and the northern end is much shallower, with few locations deeper than . The lakebed is mostly sand and gravel, though it is covered by a thick layer of branches and leaves due to the lack of development along the shorelines. The water temperature is at surface level and at . The lake has very low oxygen levels at its deepest points. Fish ladder and alewives Nequasset Lake is home to a commercial alewife fishery. Originally built in 1955, the fish ladder found on Nequasset Brook allows for fish to pass into the lake to spawn while also allowing for fish to be harvested. By 2011 the original fish ladder was in inadequate shape. In 2014 a new fish ladder was installed on the site of the old ladder to allow for easier fish passage.\\"Nequasset Fish Ladder Restoration\\" Kennebec Estuary Land Trust. Retrieved November 3, 2015. In 2015 Nequasset lake had an estimated run of 300,666 alewives. View of smoke house below fish ladder. Fishery Nequasset Lake is home to the fish of a typical warm-water lake. These include largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, chain pickerel, white perch, yellow perch, pumpkinseed sunfish, redbreast sunfish, hornpout, eel, and a variety of baitfish. Anglers report largemouth bass in the range of 2‚Äì4 pounds with the occasional 5-pound or bigger fish. Bass fishing is most productive in Nequasset Lake from late spring to early fall, with peak fishing in midsummer. The Maine Department of Inland Fisheries & Wildlife annually stocks the lake with brown trout to provide winter anglers with cold-water gamefish during the ice-fishing season. Because of low oxygen levels at the lake's deepest points and high temperatures in shallow water, it is unlikely that any trout hold over into the summer months. Trout can however be caught in the first weeks after iceout. Public access Nequasset Lake can be accessed off of Old Stage Road at its northern inlet or at Nequasset Park off of George Wright Road at its southern outlet. Access on the north end is limited by a bridge, which can make passage in a motorized boat difficult when the water level is high. Nequasset Lake is prohibited to motorboats of greater than 10 horsepower because it is a public water supply. Trails leading to rocky points on multiple parts of the lake are present and allow for productive bank fishing. Water supply Nequasset Lake is the principal water supply for the Bath Water District, which serves the city of Bath and the southern portion of Woolwich. The lake's water is supplied to 15,000 people in 3,000 homes and buildings. The Bath Water District's pump station is a large brick building situated on the southwest end of the lake. It is the only major structure located on the body of water.

After winning his first two races as a two-year-old, the horse recorded only one in from fifteen starts over the next two years. In 2015 however, he showed marked improvement to become one of the best horses in Japan, winning six races including the Takarazuka Kinen and the autumn edition of the Tenno Sho. He was voted Best Older Male Horse in the JRA Awards for 2015. Background Lovely Day is a dark bay or brown horse with a white star bred in Japan by his owner Makoto Kaneko. His sire, King Kamehameha was one of the best Japanese colts of his generation, beating a field including Heart's Cry and Daiwa Major in the 2004 Japanese Derby. His other winners as a breeding stallion include Lord Kanaloa, Rose Kingdom (Japan Cup), Belshazzar (Japan Cup Dirt), Rulership (Queen Elizabeth II Cup) and Apapane. Lovely Day's dam won one race, the Listed Sweetpea Stakes from five starts in 2002 and 2003. The colt was sent into training with Yasutoshi Ikee, previously best known for handling Orfevre. Racing career=2012: two-year-old season Lovely Day began his racing career by winning a maiden race over 1800 metres at Kokura Racecourse on 19 August 2012. Four weeks later at Hanshin Racecourse he followed up in the Nojiku Stakes over the same distance, beating Sammaru Home. In November he was dropped in distance but moved up in class for the Grade II Keio Hai Nisai Stakes over 1400 metres at Tokyo Racecourse and finished second of the sixteen runners behind A Shin Top. On his final appearance of the season the colt contested Japan's most prestigious race for juveniles, the Grade I Asahi Hai Futurity Stakes over 1600 metres at Nakayama Racecourse in December and finished seventh, four and a half lengths behind Logotype. 2013: three- year-old season As a three-year-old in 2013, Lovely Day failed to win in seven starts. After finishing fifth in the Grade III Arlington Cup on his seasonal debut he finished down the field in the Grade III Mainichi Hai and the Grade I Satsuki Sho before running seventh behind Kizuna in the Tokyo Yushun. He was then matched against older horses and finished second to the six-year-old Meisho Naruto in a handicap race at Kokura in August. After a three-month break he returned to finish second to Curren Mirotic in the Grade II Kinko Sho at Chukyo Racecourse and ended his season by finishing twelfth behind his stablemate Orfevre in the Arima Kinen. 2014: four-year-old season Lovely Day began his third season by finishing third in the Group III Chunichi Shimbun Hai at Chukyo. He was then dropped in class and recorded his first victory in nineteen months when he won the Metropolitan Stakes over 2400 metres at Tokyo on 26 April. The horse failed to reach the first three in his remaining four races that year: he finished fifth in a handicap at Tokyo in June, sixth in a similar event at Fukushima Racecourse in July, fifth at Tokyo in November and fourth to Last Impact in the Kinko Sho in December. 2015: five-year-old season Having won only one minor race in the last two seasons, Lovely Day began the 2015 season in the Grade III Nikkan Sports Sho Nakayama Kimpai over 2000 metres at Nakayama on 4 January. Ridden by the Irish jockey Fran Berry he recorded his first important victory as he defeated Logotype by one and a quarter lengths in a record time of 1:57.80. On 15 February at Kyoto Racecourse he started third favourite behind Harp Star and Kizuna in the Grade II Kyoto Kinen over 2200 metres. Ridden for the only time by Keita Tosaki he overtook the pace-setting Suzuka Deevious to win a nose with Kizuna a neck away in third. His trainer commented \\"This was an ideal race for him today. He got a smooth run after a good break, and held on during a strong duel\\". In his next two races he finished sixth behind Gold Ship in the Hanshin Daishoten and eighth behind the same horse in the spring edition of the Tenno Sho. On 6 June Lovely Day was partnered by Yasunari Iwata when he contested the Naruo Kinen over 2000 metres at Hanshin and started 3/1 second favourite behind the six-year-old Air Saumur who had won the race in the previous year. He won by two lengths from Majesty Hearts, with Azuma Shuttle taking third ahead of Air Saumur. Twenty-two days after his win in the Naruo Kinen, Lovely Day returned to Grade I class for the first time since 2012 when he contested one of Japan's most prestigious races, the Takarazuka Kinen over 2200 metres at Hanshin. Gold Ship started favourite ahead of Lachesis (Queen Elizabeth II Commemorative Cup), Nuovo Record (Yushun Himba), One And Only (Tokyo Yushun) and Curren Mirotic (Kinko Sho) with Lovely Day the 13.2/1 sixth choice in a sixteen-runner field. The other runners included the 2014 Kikuka Sho winner Toho Jackal. Ridden by Yuga Kawada, he overcame a wide draw to take the lead 200 metres from the finish and recorded his first success at the highest level as he won by a neck from the five-year-old mare Denim And Ruby with the outsider Shonan Pandora taking third ahead of Toho Jackal. After the race Kawada commented \\"I was able to position him behind the front-runner with ease, as the pace was slow, and tried to race him with good rhythm. I was a bit worried about the track, but he responded really well. I was aware of the mare closing in and prayed that he could fend her off\\". After a summer break, Lovely Day returned to action in the Grade II Kyoto Daishoten on 12 October. He was again partnered by Kawada and started 2.1/1 favourite against nine opponents. Lachesis, One And Only and Curren Mirotic were again in opposition, but his most serious rival in the betting was Sounds of Earth who had finished runner-up to Toho Jackal in the Kikuka Sho. Lovely Day recorded his third consecutive victory as he won by one and a quarter lengths from Sounds of Earth, with Curren Mirotic half a lengths away in third. On 1 November Lovely Day, ridden by Suguru Hamanaka started 2.4/1 favourite for the autumn edition of the Tenno Sho over 2000 metres at Tokyo Racecourse. Old rivals in the field were Shonan Pandora, Last Impact, One And Only and Curren Mirotic whilst the other contenders included A Shin Hikari (Mainichi Okan), Decipher (Sapporo Kinen), Isla Bonita (2014 Japanese champion three-year-old colt), Spielberg (winner of the race in 2014) and the three-year-olds Ambitious and Satono Crown (third to Duramente in the Tokyo Yushun). Lovely Day raced in fourth before moving forward on the final turn and taking the lead in the straight. He defeated the fast-finishing outsider Staphanos by half a length, with Isla Bonita taking third ahead of Shonan Pandora and Ambitious. His trainer Ikee commented \\"We still have future races to think about so he wasn't completely tuned up, but for a second autumn start, he was in good form. The horse has developed beautifully and has entered his prime. We have the Japan Cup in mind as his next start. We'll carefully prepare him race by race\\". For his last two races of the season, Lovely Day was stepped up in distance to contest the Japan Cup over 2400 metres and the Arima Kinen over 2500 metres. In the Japan Cup at Tokyo Racecourse on 29 November he started favourite in an eighteen- runner field which included challengers from France, Britain and Germany. In a closely contested finish he was beaten into third place by Shonan Pandora and Last Impact. In the Arima Kinen on 27 December he started second choice in the betting behind Gold Ship. In another close finish he came home in fifth place behind Gold Actor, Sounds of Earth, Kitasan Black and Marialite, beaten less than two lengths by the winner. 2016: six-year-old season Lovely Day remained in training at six and began his campaign in the Shinkei Osaka Hai on 3 April. He started the 2/1 favourite and finished fourth behind Ambitious, Kitasan Black and Shonan Pandora. He was then sent to Hong Kong for the Queen Elizabeth II Cup on 24 April and started the 1.9/1 favourite. He was sent into the lead from the start by the locally based jockey Jo√£o Moreira but was overtaken in the straight and finished fourth behind Werther, Military Attack and Blazing Speed. Lovely Day returned to Japan and in June he attempted to repeat his 2015 success in the Takarazuka Kinen. Starting at odds of 10.6/1 he tracked the leaders for most of the way but was unable to quicken in the straight and finished fourth behind Marialite, Duramente and Kitasan Black. After the summer break, Lovely Day returned in the Kyoto Daishoten on 10 October and finished a close third behind Kitasan Black and Admire Deus. In the Tenno Sho he ran disappointingly and came home unplaced. On his final start he ran for the second time at Sha Tin Racecourse in Hong Kong and finished fourth to Beauty Only in the Hong Kong Cup on 11 December. Assessment and awards In the 2015 JRA Awards Lovely Day was nominated in two categories. In the poll for Japanese Horse of the Year he received 55 votes, making him runner-up to the miler Maurice. He did however, beat Maurice by 174 votes to 114 to be to take the title of Best Older Male Horse. In the 2015 World's Best Racehorse Rankings Lovely Day was given a rating of 121, making him the 27th best racehorse in the world. Stud record At the end of his racing career Lovely Day was retired to become a breeding stallion at the Breeders Stallion Station in Hokkaido. In his first season at stud he sired 101 registered foals.

Education and early life Jane Elizabeth Parker was born in 1960 in Great Britain and completed her undergraduate degree at the University of Bradford in applied Biology in 1983. She went on to earn her PhD in 1986 from Swansea University on protein synthesis in Euglena. Career and research Following her PhD, she was a postdoctoral researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Plant Breeding Research. Throughout the 1990s, she worked at the Sainsbury Laboratory at the John Innes Centre in the Norwich Research Park, at Norwich, England, but left in August 2001, with her husband, Dr. George Coupland to take up a post as an independent researcher at Cologne's Max Planck Institute. In 2002, Parker was awarded a Sofja Kovalevskaja Prize to continue her research into plant immune responses. She researches how plants defend themselves from disease-causing microorganisms. Her work involves isolating the genes which trigger innate defence mechanisms and combines genetics with molecular biology to evaluate how plants are able to avoid disease. Her research has discovered that there are multiple layers of defence but that a protein, called EDS1, which combines with other proteins to form complexes, is the initial trigger. The immune response varies depending on whether the complex formed is developed from combining with the protein PAD4 or SAG101 to initiate the response to disease resistance. Since 2009, Parker has been an associate professor at the Institute of Genetics University of Cologne in Germany. In 2013, she was elected a member of the Academy of Sciences Leopoldina.

Before his election in 2015, Dougherty had served on the Pennsylvania Court of Common Pleas in Philadelphia since 2001, serving as an administrative judge of the trial division. He had been appointed to the bench by Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge in 2001, and was elected to the first of two 10-year terms later that year, receiving the most vote among 14 candidates. After his election, he requested to be assigned to the family division, where he felt he could have the most significant societal impact, and has prided himself on helping families and children during his judicial career. Dougherty became Supervising Judge of the Juvenile Division of Philadelphia Family Court in 2003. There he implemented reforms like easing access to the court and what he called a \\"changing of the culture\\" among a judiciary of mostly older judges. He received 78 percent of the vote when he ran for retention in 2011, and received support from both Democrats and Republicans. Dougherty graduated from the Antioch School of Law in Washington, D.C. in 1988, and is a graduate of Temple University. He ran as a Democrat for Pennsylvania Supreme Court in 2015, and was part of a Democratic sweep of all three court vacancies, along with David Wecht, and Christine Donohue. They defeated Republican candidates Judith Olsen, Michael George, and Anne Covey, in a campaign that saw more than $15 million in donations from special interests. Dougherty received a \\"recommended\\" rating from the Pennsylvania Bar Association, and received strong support from organized labor groups, in part due to Dougherty's relationship with his brother, indicted Philadelphia labor leader John J. \\"Johnny Doc\\" Dougherty. Dougherty was the campaign's top fundraiser, raising more than $3.5 million. Dougherty grew up in South Philadelphia in what he described as a \\"very blue-collar, working-class neighborhood\\", and was the first from his family to graduate college, working three part-time jobs as he attended Temple.

It is found throughout coastal California and in south- western Oregon as far north as Douglas County. It is widely distributed in southern California. It is found in many habitats such as coastal chaparral, mountain forest, mountain-desert transition zone, and occasionally in the deserts from sea level to at least 2000 meters. The wingspan is about 29.5‚Äì35 mm. The forewings are granular mossy green, occasionally yellowish green, with a mottled dark-grey to black and light-green pattern that obscures all but the darkest parts of the lines and spots. The darkest areas are a small patch at the base of the trailing edge of the wing, the cell and fold in the medial area, a bar on the costa preceding the subterminal line, and terminal area opposite the reniform spot. The relatively small reniform spot and round orbicular spot are filled with peripheral whitish and central green scales. The basal, antemedial and postmedial lines are double, black filled with green, and the subterminal line is green. All are sinuous and appear incomplete. The hindwings are light brown grey with a darker border. Adults are on wing from April to early July. The larvae feed on Nemophila, Pholistoma auritium, Lilja and Lithophragma species.

Funded by AK Print, Afriscan, Badge It!, Ish Ramkissoon Surveys and aided by the university's department of Drama & Performance Studies, the production focused on reaching students via 'South African-ising' the play and locating the monologues in a South African socio-cultural and political context. AS the play is located in an American context, the actresses felt that the text should be tweaked so as to show a bit more of an African vibe. For this purpose, the director was accepting of the fact that a lot of the actresses added in South African references such as events, words in isiZulu and commentary on current affairs in South Africa. Male students from the university were eager to help and they did help in terms of administration, lighting, sound, advertising as well as merchandise and ticket sales. The show was sold out for all performance nights and the proceeds went to the Advice Desk for the Abused in Durban. The university hopes to make the play an annual event.

In the first year, the GOH worked together with Taiwan Women‚Äôs Link and the Taipei Association of Women‚Äôs Rights to stage a bilingual Chinese-English performance of the play. Since 2006, the GOH has staged the monologues with its own staff performing the roles. The GOH is an NGO that offers services to women and girls who are victims of domestic violence and sexual abuse. By playing out the stage roles, the GOH employees say they are able to identify more closely with their clients. In the 2012 show, GOH employees were joined by the Barefoot Alice theater group ‚Äì a group of actresses who were victims of sexual abuse or domestic violence in the past, and who came up through one of the GOH‚Äôs counseling centers. The actors performed ‚Äúplayback‚Äù improvised skits of stories told by members of the audience.

It is built on the remains of a Napoleonic defense system consisting of Fort Terlincthun and a sea fort, opposite the tip of the cape, of which only the foundations remain.  The Napoleonic camp of Boulogne  The Fort de Terlincthun was a simple mound of earth surrounded by a stone wall built by Napoleon I between 1806 and 1808. There is nothing of it left today.

Coast Battery  Former barracks A S√©r√© de Rivi√®res system fortification was completed on the site in 1879, with three other forts: * The battery of Cape Alprech (Le Portel) * The battery of Mount Couppes (Le Portel) * The battery (Boulogne-sur-Mer). They are all built on the same pattern (a barracks, a powder magazine, 2 or 3 shelters, 3-6 platforms for cannon and a well) and are surrounded by a stone wall and a dry moat. Together they protected the port of Boulogne. Between the world wars, the battery of la Cr√®che was modernized. The old armament was replaced by four 194 mm guns (Mle 1902) each having two ammunition bunkers. The perimeter wall was partially demolished to make room for them. During the First World War the fort defended the port of Boulogne-sur-Mer which played a strategic role in supply and in evacuation of the wounded. Gun emplacement overlooking the sea During the Second World War, the fort was the scene of heavy fighting. The French destroyer Chacal was sunk off Portel while trying to stop the German advance. The German Navy took possession of the premises, concreted three French emplacements and replaced the weapons with 105 mm guns. The fort was liberated September 22, 1944, by the Queen's Own Rifles Canadian regiment.

Before she began field work, Edlund was often ill and was frequently confined to bed as a child. She said that she took up botany because she thought that she \\"shouldn't study anything I'd have to chase\\". She began work with a United Nations team tasked with producing an inventory of plants and animals in the far north. She worked in the Canadian Arctic for the Geological Survey of Canada (GSC) from 1974 to 1994, when she was forced to retire due to a problem with an inflamed appendix which was not diagnosed in time and wound up affecting her short term memory. Edlund was an expert on plant distribution patterns in the Arctic. She also published a book on Common arctic wildflowers of the Northwest Territories which she illustrated with her own watercolours. Edlund made extensive collections of plants across the Canadian Arctic. More than 5,000 of these collections are housed in the National Herbarium of Canada at the Canadian Museum of Nature. At the end of her professional career, she managed the High Arctic Global Change Observatory for the GSC.

The character was played by Jon Peyton-Price from the character's introduction 1985 until 1996, and by James Alexandrou from 1996 until 2007. When Alexandrou took over the role, the character was seen more regularly and was featured in prominent storylines such as sleeping with his neighbour Sonia Jackson (Natalie Cassidy) and getting her pregnant with their daughter Bex; accidentally killing his friend Jamie Mitchell (Jack Ryder) after running him over in his car, which results in Martin being imprisoned for Jamie's death and subsequently feuding with the latter's godfather Phil (Steve McFadden); enduring a problematic marriage with Sonia after their wedding; and coping with the deaths of both his brother Mark (Todd Carty) and their mother Pauline (Wendy Richard). Alexandrou quit the role in 2006, and Martin departed on 2 February 2007. In October 2014, it was announced that series producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins decided to reintroduce Martin, with the role being recast to James Bye and Martin returned on 5 December 2014. He took a break from the show on 2 August 2019 as part of Stacey's temporary exit storyline but returned on 4 October 2019. Since his return in 2014, Martin has divorced Sonia; married Stacey Branning (Lacey Turner); finding out that Stacey's baby Arthur is actually the son of his best friend Kush Kazemi (Davood Ghadami); surviving a bus crash; a brief stint in prison for assaulting a police officer, the premature birth of his daughter Hope Fowler; briefly separating with Stacey after discovering her one-night stand with her former father-in- law Max Branning (Jake Wood); feuding with Stacey's cousin Kat Moon (Jessie Wallace) and his friend Kush over the custody of Arthur; dealing with Bex's disappearance and attempted suicide; being blackmailed by Ben Mitchell (Max Bowden) into committing crimes for him, ending his marriage to Stacey in attempts to protect her and their children against the death threats made towards them by Ben, a one-night stand with Stacey's best friend Ruby Allen (Louisa Lytton), descending into crime, being involved in a hit-and-run accident, kidnapping Keanu Taylor (Danny Walters) and faking his death with Linda Carter (Kellie Bright), briefly reuniting with his ex-wife Sonia and starting a relationship with Ruby. Storylines=1985‚Äì2007 When Pauline and Arthur tell Pauline's mother Lou Beale (Anna Wing) that Pauline is pregnant, Lou is furious because they have two teenage children, Mark Fowler (David Scarboro) and Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully), and Arthur is unemployed. Lou gives them the choice of either giving the child up for adoption, having an abortion or the family moving out of her home, but she is won round when the family organise a holiday for her to Clacton. The baby's first christening is postponed when he is diagnosed with gastroenteritis and Lou is delighted when he is finally christened Martin Albert Fowler. When Pauline discovers Arthur had an affair with Christine Hewitt (Elizabeth Power), she bans Arthur from seeing Martin, but they reconcile. Arthur dies when Martin is ten, Martin then befriends a small gang of young criminals from his local school; a series of petty thefts, burglaries and vandalism that culminates in him being arrested. Martin is placed under the supervision of a social worker. Martin has a brief relationship with Nicky di Marco (Carly Hillman), but she refuses to have sex with him. Martin turns to Sonia Jackson (Natalie Cassidy) after Nicky dumps him. Sonia is feeling vulnerable, and after getting drunk, they lose their virginities to each other; she becomes pregnant. Sonia gives birth to daughter Chloe Jackson and she decides to give Chloe up for adoption. When she names Martin as the father, a feud erupts between the Jacksons and the Fowlers, with Pauline demanding custody of the baby instead of her being adopted. This leads to a court hearing where Sonia asks that baby Chloe be returned to her and she will raise her with her boyfriend, Jamie Mitchell (Jack Ryder), if Martin asks for custody with Pauline to support him. However, the judge rules that the adoption should go ahead when Martin admits that he does not want to be a father. Martin's deviancy continues when he takes drugs provided by Nick Cotton (John Altman), which leads to Martin's brother Mark (now Todd Carty) taking revenge and leaving Nick temporarily paralysed. Martin receives a six-month prison sentence after driving the car that hit Jamie, causing his death. However, he only serves two months, being let out early for good behaviour. Once released, Martin resumes his criminal lifestyle by robbing a shop, blackmailing Kareena Ferreira (Pooja Shah) and growing cannabis in his late father's shed, assisted by his best friend, Asif Malik (Ashvin Luximon). This leads to family friend Derek Harkinson (Ian Lavender) taking the blame when the police find out, as Martin cannot risk trouble with the law, due to his previous convictions. It is not until Martin is confronted and forgiven by a bereaved Sonia that he finally begins to feel remorse for his actions and attempts to reform himself. After a few brief relationships, including a one-night stand with Kelly Taylor (Brooke Kinsella), Martin begins growing close to Sonia, and they fall in love. After Sonia helps him come to terms with the death of his brother, Martin decides to propose marriage. Amidst constant interference from Pauline, Martin and Sonia decide to elope. The newlyweds move in with Pauline but she puts constant strain on their marriage with her meddling. Several months later, Martin unwittingly puts his marriage in jeopardy when he encounters Sarah Cairns (Alison Pargeter). After passing out drunk at Sarah's house, she claims that Martin slept with her and begins stalking him. When Martin physically threatens her, she calls the police and has him arrested before revealing their \\"affair\\" to Sonia. Sarah's plan is thwarted however, as Sonia refuses to leave her husband. After admitting that their affair is a lie, Sarah stabs Martin with a kitchen knife but Sonia hits her over the head with Pauline's fruit bowl. Sarah is committed to a mental institution and Martin and Sonia put the incident behind them. Pauline's influence over Martin starts putting a strain on his marriage. Things worsen when Sonia finds out that Martin and Pauline have been visiting her and Martin's daughter (now named Rebecca) against her wishes. Their marriage breaks down, due to Sonia's affair with a fellow student, Naomi Julien (Petra Letang). Martin is devastated but she soon regrets it when Martin is given custody of their daughter following the death of her legal guardian and they frequently exclude her from Rebecca's life. Martin tries to move on by dating Carly Wicks (Kellie Shirley) briefly, stirring up some jealousy in Sonia. Immediately after they divorce, they begin to regret it and sleep together. They then secretly reunite and hope to keep it from Pauline but she eventually finds out and they argue. Pauline prepares to leave but the house catches fire, and Martin saves her. Pauline then claims that she is dying from a brain tumour. In fact, she is faking it to make sure that Martin ends his relationship with Sonia, which he eventually does. However, Martin is stunned when it is revealed that Pauline has been lying. When Martin discovers that his mother is leaving for the United States on Christmas Day, he tries to persuade her to stay, but her decision is final. On Christmas Day, Martin proposes to Sonia again and she accepts, but later that day he discovers his mother's dead body in the Square. Martin believes Joe murdered her, but Sonia confesses that she is responsible, as she had hit her earlier. After they fight, the police arrive and Sonia is arrested on suspicion of murder. She is released and he forbids her to see Rebecca. Pauline's post-mortem results are announced and Martin is told that Pauline's death was caused by a severe blow to the head. Sonia goes on the run with Rebecca, leaving Martin devastated. He tries to find them to no avail and when he hears Phil Mitchell helped Sonia and Rebecca escape, he kidnaps Phil's son Ben (Charlie Jones) and holds him on the rail bridge. Phil manages to convince Martin to let Ben go. Sonia and Rebecca soon return and Martin calls the police to arrest her. It is later revealed that Joe killed Pauline. When Pauline's will is read, she gives Martin possession of the house but only if he does not live with Sonia. Martin and Sonia reunite anyway and they, Rebecca and Pauline's dog, Betty, leave Walford together. It is later revealed they are touring the US, staying with Martin's sister, Michelle. Sonia returns to Walford alone for her sister Bianca Jackson's (Patsy Palmer) wedding. Initially Sonia says that Martin and Rebecca are fine, but then tells her mother Carol Jackson (Lindsey Coulson) that she and Martin are having problems in their marriage. Sonia reveals that she and Rebecca are living in Dagenham and that Martin now has a new girlfriend in Manchester. Sonia returns to Walford and admits that she and Martin still have marital problems. 2014‚Äì Martin returns to Walford to support Sonia on the evening of her Fat Blasters' Christmas party, but arrives late and discovers she has collapsed due to complications with a gastric band she got in Bulgaria. Sonia tells Martin that she had the operation as she felt he was not attracted to her any longer and he later recognises that they do not love each other and they separate, with Martin returning to Dagenham. Martin returns to Walford for the wedding of his cousin Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt). He, Stacey Branning (Lacey Turner) and Kush Kazemi (Davood Ghadami) discover Nick's dead body at number 23 (recreating the first ever scene of EastEnders). After agreeing not to speak of the matter, they discover that Nick's mother Dot Branning (June Brown) has called the police and confessed that she has killed him. After walking Stacey home, he tries to kiss her but she rejects him. He later returns while Ian and his wife Jane Beale (Laurie Brett) are on their honeymoon, staying at their house and catches Cindy Williams (Mimi Keene) having sex with Liam Butcher (James Forde) and decides to keep an eye on her. He manages to convince his and Sonia's daughter, now calling herself Bex (Jasmine Armfield) to come to Walford, where she reveals her new look as a Goth. He also attends Donna Yates' (Lisa Hammond) birthday party with Kush and their friends from football. He tries to kiss Donna for a bet but ends up getting into a fight with Arthur \\"Fatboy\\" Chubb (Ricky Norwood). He also confides in Kush that he thinks he and Sonia could get their marriage back on track but then spots Sonia kissing her new girlfriend, Tina Carter (Luisa Bradshaw-White). He later argues with Sonia in The Vic after revealing the truth about her and Tina and tells Bex that Sonia is a lesbian, making her reject Sonia. After Martin and Sonia have a meaningful conversation about their relationship, he sends Bex to live with Sonia. It is later revealed that Martin is homeless and sleeping in the back of his van. Alfie Moon (Shane Richie) tells Ian of Martin's troubles and Martin moves in with Ian and later tells Sonia that he has lost their house in Dagenham. After filing for divorce, Martin rents a flat with Stacey and her daughter Lily Branning (Aine Garvey) and they start dating, which gets serious despite Stacey's lingering feelings for Kush. Their relationship progresses as Martin and Sonia's divorce comes through and Martin researches bipolar disorder. When Martin finds out that Stacey is pregnant, he initially wants her to book a termination but later supports her decision to keep the baby. She discovers he is planning to propose and says she does not want to marry again, so he proposes a commitment without marriage, and she accepts. Stacey is electrocuted by a faulty socket that Lee Carter (Danny-Boy Hatchard) failed to repair properly so Martin punches him and threatens to kill him if the baby dies as a result. At the hospital, Martin finds out she is okay and the baby is a boy. When Stacey is discharged, Martin announces to everyone in The Vic that the baby is a boy and invites Lee and Whitney to join him, Stacey, Kush, and Shabnam Masood (Rakhee Thakrar) for lunch. He apologises for hitting Lee and forgives him for the incident. Shabnam discovers that Martin is not the father of Stacey's baby, but she and Kush decide not to tell Martin. When Stacey's son is born on Christmas Eve, Martin names him Arthur Fowler, after his father. Two weeks later, Kat Moon (Jessie Wallace) discovers that Martin is not Arthur's father and when Stacey and Arthur go missing, Martin and Kush grow concerned and try to find her. Martin eventually finds Stacey on the roof of The Vic. She claims that Arthur is the son of God and that God will rescue them from what she thinks are demons. Martin, believing it is a symptom of her unmedicated bipolar, goes along with what her and convinces her to come home with him. On the day of Charlie's funeral, Stacey is upset that she did not get to the church so God could give her a message. She does not allow Martin near Arthur and smashes glass cups to protect them. When Stacey goes to Kush and Shabnam's for safety, Martin persuades her that she is safe with him. He takes her to hospital and after Stacey speaks to a psychologist, Martin learns that there are no mother and baby units and that Stacey will have to be sectioned. Martin breaks the news to Stacey and is later informed Stacey is suffering from postpartum psychosis. When Martin visits Stacey, he realises that she needs to see Arthur and tries to find a hospital with a mother and baby unit. Kush convinces Martin to have a night out and deliberately leaves his phone behind. When Martin returns, he discovers he missed a call about a mother and baby unit and has missed out. Martin punches Kush and they fight, leading Kush to admit that he has ruined everything. Martin travels to find another mother and baby unit the following day, taking Arthur with him while doing so. Sonia and Bex learn that Martin and Arthur were involved in a car crash on their way home. Martin discharges himself from hospital, worried that he will miss Stacey's medical review but he has already missed it. He visits Stacey after discovering she has chosen to stay in hospital, where she says that everyone is better off without her, asking him to raise Arthur and Lily the way she wanted. He realises she feels that way because she is in hospital, and vows to break her out. Stacey refuses and the doctor tells him to go home and rest. Martin finds a mother and baby unit for Stacey in Essex and takes her and Arthur there. A nurse hands him a letter Stacey left behind and he reads it at home, discovering that Arthur is Kush's son. He visits Stacey and tells her he knows the truth. She begs for his forgiveness, but he leaves and goes to America, returning a few weeks later. He sees Kush and immediately punches him. He tells Sonia he is only collecting his belongings. When under pressure by those denouncing him for abandoning Arthur, Martin publicly reveals that Kush is Arthur's father. As Martin is about to leave for the airport, Kush promises to be a good father but assures Martin that he will always be the real father no matter what, Martin goes to the mother and baby unit and reunites with Stacey and Arthur. During Stacey's first home visit, Martin is annoyed when Stacey's half-brother Kyle Slater (Riley Carter Millington) returns but after Kyle tells Stacey he is transgender, she invites Kyle to live with them and Martin, not knowing the truth, reluctantly agrees. When Martin and Stacey reconcile, Stacey proposes to Martin and he accepts. They also tell Kush that he can be a part of Arthur's life, but Kush later says he no longer wants this. When Kat stops paying Stacey's rent, Martin sets up his own market stall but some of his merchandise is faulty and he is forced to issue refunds, though is unable to get a refund himself. Andy Flynn (Jack Derges) assists Martin by getting him some work in Sunderland for two weeks. Martin accepts this, but when he returns, Stacey is underwhelmed with the funds he has collected; he insists more is being transferred soon. Andy later tells Martin he knows he was fired from the job and is lying to Stacey. Andy tells Stacey, so Martin explains that he was underqualified for the position. Martin asks Andy for more work, so Andy says that 40 toilets were delivered in error to the flats he is renovating and they could sell them and split the profits. Martin agrees and with Stacey and Kyle's help, they successfully steal them. When Stacey learns her cousin Belinda Peacock (Carli Norris) is trying to sell them back to Jack, Martin, Stacey, Kyle and Belinda put them back. Following Peggy Mitchell's (Barbara Windsor) death, Stacey tells Martin she cannot get married, but she changes her mind. Martin and Stacey marry at the registry office. When Sonia moves away, Bex moves in with Martin and Stacey and the family then move into Sonia's old house, but Kyle and Belinda then both move away. Later, Martin is furious when he finds out that Bex's boyfriend and Kush's younger brother, Shakil Kazemi (Shaheen Jafargholi) has ended his relationship with Bex immediately after having sex with her. He attacks Shakil in the market and announces his actions to everyone but this humiliates Bex. He apologises to Bex and Stacey and later comforts Bex. Martin is unhappy when Stacey's former flame Max Branning (Jake Wood) returns to Walford after being wrongly accused of murdering Lucy Beale (Hetti Bywater) and he and Stacey grow close. Martin tells Stacey he is worried about Max's motives for coming back and informs her that Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) bribed the juror of Max's trial to find him guilty, which Stacey later tells Max. Martin discovers that the market is being moved and attempts to get the market traders to strike. A bus crashes into the market and Martin is trapped under it. He tells Stacey he loves her, presuming he will not survive, but is rescued by a group of people who lift the bus so he can be moved. At the hospital, Martin agrees to having a baby with Stacey. Bex starts to be bullied at school when a nude photo that Shakil took of himself and sent to Bex is distributed around the school from Bex's phone, though Louise Mitchell (Tilly Keeper), Alexandra D'Costa (Sydney Craven) and Madison Drake (Seraphina Beh) are the ones who sent it. Shakil's friend Keegan Baker (Zack Morris) takes revenge by distributing a pornographic clip with Bex's face imposed on the model's body, which Martin eventually discovers. The police become involved as the video is considered an indecent image of a minor, and the photo of Shakil is discovered. Bex takes the blame for it, covering for Alexandra and Madison, who have threatened her. When Martin sees Carmel and Shakil at the school, Martin brands Shakil dirty and threatens violence against him if he ever sees him again. Martin then grounds Bex due to her actions, and refuses to let Carmel see Arthur due to Shakil's behaviour, prompting a fight between him, Kush, Carmel, and Stacey at their house. The police then arrive, and reveal the news that Bex also had topless selfies of herself on her phone, which though she had deleted and not shared, were backed up to the cloud. Martin's phone is also confiscated as a result. Devastated, he insists that Bex will not be allowed to have her phone back and that she is banned from social media. However, Bex soon becomes a victim of bullying at the hands of Alexandra and Madison. Martin soon starts to talk to Bex and reminds her about how being responsible for Jamie's death has made him the person he is now and that she should not let anyone talk negatively about her no matter the situation. Bex starts a relationship with Preston Cooper (Martin Anzor), Michelle's former teenage student from America, not knowing that Michelle is having a secret relationship with him, which is the main cause of losing contact with her own family. Bex eventually discovers their affair and publicly exposes them. A disgusted Martin disowns Michelle as a result and bans her from his life. Stacey attempts to get Martin and Michelle to reconcile but this fails. Stacey also tells Martin she is pregnant. Sonia arrives back in Walford after Bex phones her in tears due to her bullying and Bex tells her family what has happened with Madison and Alexandra. Sonia tells Martin she wants Bex to live with her, but Bex stays with Martin and Stacey. During a Walford in Bloom event, a gas leak causes an explosion in the Square and Martin panics when he cannot find Stacey. He attempts to push past a police officer but when they try and hold him back, Martin pushes one over, resulting in him getting arrested just as it is revealed that Stacey is safe. Martin receives a four-week sentence, two weeks of which he must spend in prison. When Stacey visits him in prison, she is horrified to find that Martin has bruises on his torso, as a result of bullying. While Martin is in prison, Stacey discovers that Arthur is at high risk of having Brugada's Syndrome, a heart condition inherited from Kush. This results in Stacey being disorganised and short-tempered. Martin returns home to find Stacey arguing with Carmel after the former has hurt Lily. Martin is worried when Stacey tells him about Arthur's health risk. When he sees what this is doing to Stacey, he confides in Michelle that their unborn baby could be the biggest mistake of their lives. Stacey overhears and angrily tells Martin to leave if he is not able to love Arthur and Lily and their unborn child the same. However, Martin assures Stacey that he will love all their kids equally. Martin, Kush, Carmel and Stacey are agitated when Arthur has to be hospitalised when Bex finds him in a lifeless state. Carmel is alarmed to find that Arthur fainted due to consuming Stacey's bipolar pills. She is horrified to discover that Arthur has bruises on his arm, although this is from other kids yanking him at the hospital. Lily tells Carmel that Stacey caused Arthur's bruises, prompting Carmel to inform Social Services. However, Carmel soon realises her mistake. After an unsuccessful attempt from Carmel at resting the issue, Social Services turn up at Martin and Stacey's house and inform them that Lily and Arthur need to be removed for the night, leaving Martin and Stacey heart-broken. The couple eventually get Arthur back, but Stacey is enraged when Carmel admits that she phoned Social Services, and the two women have another altercation that leads to the premature birth of their daughter, Hope. When Max is rejected by the community for conning people out of their businesses for the redevelopment of the Square, Stacey is one of the few people that offers him support. She invites him to stay in their house, much to Martin's displeasure. His insecurity leads to him telling Stacey that Max is not welcome in the house. On Christmas Eve, Stacey and Max have sex. When Stacey sees Max's daughters, Lauren (Jacqueline Jossa) and Abi (Lorna Fitzgerald), fall from The Vic roof, she is instantly reminded of her former husband Bradley Branning's (Charlie Clements) death. Martin tries to calm her down, and though he suspects something happened between Stacey and Max, he tells Stacey they should carry on as normal. However, Stacey says that if they do not talk, their relationship cannot survive, so she admits to having sex with Max, later explaining that she did so as she and Martin never have time for themselves and she is left to manage the house. Martin refuses to talk to Stacey about it so it does not ruin Christmas for their children and that he will not accept blame for her actions, saying she should leave if it is going to destroy their family. However, Martin later decides to make up with Stacey after speaking to Ted Murray (Christopher Timothy), but finds the house empty and a goodbye note from Stacey, saying she is leaving Walford with Lily, Arthur and Hope to stay with her mother Jean Slater (Gillian Wright). A dejected Martin ends up spending New Year's Eve alone in his house and the next day, confronts Max about sleeping with Stacey but declines to punch him, saying revenge doesn't help. However, Martin later punches Max but admits that he still doesn't feel right about it and that he only did it for Carmel, whom Max also used and slept with. Stacey returns a few weeks later and when Stacey is out, Martin accuses her of being with Max when it turns out she is not with Whitney. Stacey and Martin argue and when Martin suggests Stacey was with Max due to Abi's death, she slaps him. Stacey thinks the marriage is broken and tells Martin he should move out, accusing him of hurting her; he is hurt Stacey does not regard Lily and Arthur as his children, but he angrily throws her out and exposes her affair with Max. Martin keeps the children inside, away from Stacey, though the pair support each other briefly when Lily holds Hope by the upstairs window, asking for Stacey. Martin rejects Stacey when she says the children need her and he decides he will not let Stacey near the children. Martin decides to go for custody and when Kush finds out, he urges Stacey and Martin to resolve their problems, but he has a turn. Martin meets with Stacey to attempt to fix their marriage, but Martin decides to give up, but offers Stacey contact and Stacey contacts Ryan to help her, however she decides to call Whitney and asking her help. Whitney lets Stacey into the house and a locksmith changes the locks, devastating Martin. Martin is not happy when Stacey seemingly changes her mind about Martin looking after the children for the night, but he refuses to look after Hope when Stacey offers as he suspects she will see Max. A woman named Hayley (Katie Jarvis) takes photos of Martin and Stacey and her neighbour Arshad Ahmed (Madhav Sharma) stops Stacey from taking her children to Brighton when she argues with Martin, but Martin finds out from Jean that Stacey had not planned to go to Brighton. Martin and Stacey take Arthur out to see a show to sort out access and Martin is annoyed that Stacey has invited Kush, deciding that it has to be that way and Martin decides to file for divorce, despite Kush figuring out that Stacey may have enjoyed herself with Martin without his presence. Stacey arranges a childcare rota as an apology to Martin, but after sending an email to his solicitor to file for divorce, Martin attempts to delete his solicitor's email to Stacey, but Stacey seemingly accepts his apology, though later she contacts someone and decides to involve her solicitor. Stacey is devastated when Mo Harris (Laila Morse) returns to Walford with the news Kat is dead and Martin sets up a crowdfunding page for Kat's funeral as Stacey cannot afford it. Stacey thanks Martin and kisses him, which then turns to passion between them. Creation and development=Introduction (1985) In the first episode, it is revealed that Pauline Fowler (Wendy Richard), aged 40, is pregnant with her third child. The character's pregnancy quickly became a prominent storyline within the series. Pauline, against her mother Lou Beale (Anna Wing)'s opposition, is determined to keep the baby.Brake, Colin, p. 28 The storyline was used to spread a public message on the increased risk of genetic defects in late pregnancies, with Pauline undergoing amniocentesis tests.Wiggins, p. 118 The storyline culminates with the birth of the serial's first baby, Martin, in August 1985. Characterisation Martin started out as a \\"quiet child\\", but later grew into a \\"hooligan\\" who was always getting into trouble. In spite of his special status as baby of the Fowler family, Martin wasn't cushioned from the harsh realities of life. He grew up in the shadow of his father's mental breakdown and imprisonment, his parents' temporary separation, the premature death of his father and later his brother's death from an AIDS related illness. Indeed, it was Arthur's death that sent Martin over the edge, taking him down the path of petty crime. Departure (2007) On 15 April 2006, it was reported that Alexandrou had decided to leave EastEnders. Speaking of his decision, Alexandrou said, \\"I've decided to leave the show to experience other aspects of my industry. Having just turned 21, I feel it is an appropriate time to leave.\\" A spokesperson for the BBC said, \\"James has been a fantastic member of the cast and he goes with our best wishes.\\" Another said, \\"James has been a much loved cast member for the last 10 years. We'll miss him greatly but wish him all the best for the future.\\" Alexandrou also reported that he would like to return to EastEnders at some point in the future. \\"I owe everything to the show\\" he said, \\"I would love to come back one day, that is, if EastEnders will have me.\\" Producers reported that the door would be left open for his return. It was initially reported that Martin would remain on the show until August 2007, however the character departed in February 2007 to tie in with his wife Sonia's (Natalie Cassidy) exit. Return and recast (2014) On 12 October 2014, it was announced that James Bye has taken over the role. Executive producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins explained that the recast took place with Alexandrou's blessing. He also said, \\"Our casting executive Julia Crampsie has found a genuine relatable London bloke in the talented James Byewe are sure that viewers old and new will soon warm to Martin Fowler's charms as he returns home to Walford.\\" Lee Ryan also auditioned for the role of Martin in 2014 and read for the role with Lacey Turner, who portrays Martin's love interest Stacey Branning.

His character first appeared in the series on 18 October 1994, and became EastEnders longest-serving pet, before being killed off on 15 August 2008. Although the character is male, he has been played primarily by three female dogs: Zenna, her daughter Chancer, and her granddaughter Kyte. A fourth dog briefly served as a replacement for Zenna in 1996, when she was given time off from the show to have a litter of puppies. Wellard was briefly written out of the series under executive producer Matthew Robinson, but returned when Robinson was succeeded by John Yorke. Wellard's owners for the majority of his duration in the soap were Robbie Jackson and Gus Smith. He was voted \\"Best Pet\\" at the 2008 Digital Spy Soap Awards, and named the UK's favourite soap opera pet in a 2009 Inside Soap poll. Wellard was a fan favourite, and although a storyline that saw him threatened with euthanasia for biting local caf√© owner Ian Beale was poorly received by critics, his death drew generally favourable reviews. Storylines In October 1994, Walford resident Robbie Jackson (Dean Gaffney) takes in a dog he assumes to be a stray, naming him Wellard. The dog's owner, Mr Hammond, locates him and demands him back, but Wellard later returns to Albert Square of his own accord. Robbie realises he has been mistreated and has run away. Mr Hammond admits to neglecting Wellard, and allows Robbie to keep him. Wellard fathers puppies with Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp) and Nigel Bates's (Paul Bradley) greyhound, Frieda; however, the puppies are stillborn. When Robbie begins a relationship with a woman allergic to dogs, she gives him the ultimatum of choosing between her and Wellard: Robbie chooses Wellard. Several years later, when Robbie is due to leave Walford to live in India, Wellard is run over, delaying Robbie's departure. He is cared for by Robbie's sister Sonia (Natalie Cassidy), who gives him to her friend Gus (Mohammed George) after Robbie's departure. When Gus is involved in a minibus crash, Wellard is able to save his owner by leading him to a spot from where he can call the emergency services. Wellard is reported to the police when he bites local caf√© owner Ian Beale on the buttocks. He is taken away, with the possibility that he will be euthanised, but Gus and Deano Wicks (Matt Di Angelo) launch a campaign to save him, under the moniker \\"Walford One Owed Freedom\\" (WOOF). When Wellard is put on trial, Ian's partner Jane (Laurie Brett) presents character witness statements for the dog, written by Ian's children, Lucy (Melissa Suffield) and Peter (Thomas Law). Wellard is found guilty, but as a result of the statements, Gus is allowed to take him home as long as he keeps him on a lead at all times. When Gus leaves Walford to travel with his girlfriend Keisha (Suzie McGrath), he leaves Wellard with his friend Mickey Miller (Joe Swash). Mickey sells Wellard to Vinnie Monks (Bobby Davro), who intends to give him to his girlfriend Shirley Carter (Linda Henry). When it transpires Shirley does not want him, Vinnie gives Wellard to the Jackson family. Bianca Jackson (Patsy Palmer) feeds Wellard a chocolate, causing him to suffer from theobromine poisoning. He has to be euthanised, is cremated, and has his ashes scattered on the local allotment. Development Wellard's name is a portmanteau of \\"well hard\\", meaning \\"very tough\\". The character was originally played by a Belgian Shepherd (Tervuren) named Zenna, who was cast at the age of one. Producers had envisioned Wellard as a \\"rough, tough mongrel\\", and Zenna's owner, dog-handler Gill Raddings, explained: \\"She had the look they wanted and the ability to do what was needed on command.\\" EastEnders producers were initially unaware that Zenna was female, and had to find a canine double to serve as temporary replacement in 1996 when it transpired that she was pregnant, going on to deliver 10 puppies. Zenna was retired in 1998, as she was \\"losing her looks\\". Zenna was replaced in the soap by her daughter Chancer, who was in turn succeeded by her own daughter, Kyte. Kyte played Wellard for seven years, longer than Zenna and Chancer. The dog, whose pedigree name is Minka Kyte, came to the soap from Raddings' company Stunt Dogs, along with another EastEnders dog, Terence. She had previous experience in the television and film industry, having appeared on A Touch of Frost, The Jonny Vaughan Show, 102 Dalmatians and Gladiator. Raddings revealed that Kyte came to understand the words \\"action\\" and \\"cut\\", meaning the director would sometimes have to give an alternate cue such as \\"go\\" during scenes featuring Wellard, as the dog would become instantly alert upon hearing the usual commands, which appeared incongruous in scenes which called for Wellard to be relaxed. Kyte worked closely with Mohammed George, who played Wellard's owner Gus. George was afraid of dogs as a child, but after working with Kyte for three years, commented that they were so close he \\"sometimes [felt] like [her] dad.\\" Wellard was briefly written out of the show under executive producer Matthew Robinson, but returned in 2000, when Robinson was succeeded by John Yorke. A show insider commented: \\"Wellard just disappeared. It seemed odd because Robbie loved that dog and never noticed it had gone.\\" An EastEnders spokesman stated of his return: \\"John Yorke believes Wellard should be an integral part of Robbie's character.\\" When a 2005 storyline saw Wellard threatened with euthanasia for biting local caf√© owner Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt), James Desborough of The People suggested that EastEnders producers were hoping to emulate the success of a storyline from rival soap opera Coronation Street, which saw fans protest the arrest of character Deirdre Rachid (Anne Kirkbride), going as far as to lobby the UK Parliament for her release. Desborough deemed the storyline \\"bizarre\\" and accused the BBC of being \\"desperate to boost flagging ratings\\". An EastEnders spokesman responded that it was simply \\"a funny story which we hope the nation will get behind.\\" In June 2008, it was reported that Wellard was to be killed off. A show insider explained: \\"Wellard has been a much-loved character and everyone will be sad to see him go. But if you think about it, Wellard was not a puppy when he arrived on Albert Square, so he would be over 100 in dog years by now. It makes sense for him to bow out of the show gracefully.\\" Raddings commented: \\"I used to take Kyte on set everyday but I found the scenes when Wellard was put down too hard to watch so I asked someone else to take her to filming.\\" At the time of his death, Wellard had been in EastEnders for 14 years, making him one of the show's longest-running characters, and its longest-serving pet. Reception Wellard was voted \\"Best Pet\\" at the 2008 Digital Spy Soap Awards. His death storyline was nominated in the \\"Tearjerker\\" category at the 2008 All About Soap Bubble Awards. In 2009, a poll by magazine Inside Soap named Wellard as the UK's favourite soap opera pet. He came second in a poll to find Britain's favourite TV pet in April 2006, losing to Lassie and in March 2008 was named the fifth best dog on television by Anna Pickard of The Guardian, behind Bouncer from Neighbours, Willy from EastEnders, Lassie and Dogtanian. It was noted in The People in July 1997 that Wellard was \\"a firm favourite with the soap's fans\\". The dogs received fanmail from viewers hailing them as the best actors on EastEnders. Mohammed George played Wellard's owner Gus Smith. The storyline which saw Gus campaign to free Wellard when he was detained under the Dangerous Dogs Act was poorly received by critics. Zenna, Chancer and Kyte were occasional targets of professional jealousy from their human co-stars, and some television critics have suggested that Wellard was a better character than his owner, Robbie. When Michael Greco commented in 2002 that Wellard received better scripts than his character, Beppe di Marco, the Sunday Mirror Ian Hyland wrote: \\"He should try being Robbie Jackson. Wellard gets better scripts and better girls than him.\\" Similarly, Garry Bushell of The People compared EastEnders with rival soap Coronation Street following a 2003 scheduling clash, observing: \\"ITV had Richard Hillman's heavyweight murder confession. BBC1 gave us Robbie Jackson's heart-to-heart with Wellard. (Don't scoff ‚Äì it's tough to play moving scenes with a dumb and soppy creature, but Wellard rose to the occasion.)\\". Derek McGovern of The Mirror criticised Gaffney's acting ability, observing: \\"Outside of Lassie movies I haven't seen a dog consistently steal scenes off a human the way Wellard used to pinch them from Dean.\\" Gemma Bissix appeared in the show as a child actor from 1993 to 1998, playing Clare Bates. She commented on her return in 2008 that as a child, the dogs playing Wellard were better paid than she was. When Emma Barton, who played Honey Mitchell, was axed from the soap later that year, she spoke of her dismay that Wellard's death was being marketed as a bigger storyline than her character's exit. Roz Laws of the Sunday Mercury called it \\"particularly galling\\" that Barton's exit was upstaged by Wellard's death. Hyland was critical of the 2003 storyline which saw Robbie leave EastEnders to move to Mumbai with his girlfriend Nita (Bindya Solanki) and her son Anish (Ali Zahoor). He explained that the aspect of the storyline which upset him most was Wellard being run over \\"so the scriptwriters could engineer the inevitable last-minute dash to the airport\\", questioning: \\"What's Wellard ever done to deserve that?\\" The storyline which saw Wellard threatened with euthanasia after biting Ian Beale received negative reviews from critics, deemed \\"bizarre\\" by James Desborough of The People, and the \\"longest, most tedious ever soap storyline\\" by Jim Shelley of The Mirror. Bushell simply wrote: \\"Wellard bit Ian Beale. Which one needs the Tetanus jab?\\" Tim Teeman of The Times called it the \\"daftest\\" storyline of the year, comparing it to a similarly ill-received and long-running storyline given to the unpopular Ferreira family. Wellard's death drew generally favourable reviews from critics. The Guardian Nancy Banks-Smith deemed Wellard to have \\"died with great dignity [...] Not, as a lesser dog might, making a meal of it.\\" Grace Dent, also of The Guardian, wrote that she was an \\"emotional mess\\" when Wellard was euthanised, calling him \\"one of the true old guard of EastEnders\\". Andy Bollen of the Sunday Mail deemed it a shame Wellard had been killed off, calling him \\"the most convincing actor on the soap\\", while The Mirror Maeve Quigley called Wellard's death sadder than that of human character Jase Dyer (Stephen Lord) shortly afterwards. Wise similarly opined that Wellard upstaged most of the cast, and that his death was more of a \\"tear-jerker\\" than the return of Jim Branning (John Bardon) who had been absent after suffering from a stroke. The Mirror Kevin O'Sullivan commented: \\"a canine Oscar to the hound who played Wellard ‚Äì the pedigree chum whose sad demise after 14 years of fouling Walford's pavements was genuinely moving.\\" Shelley wrote that it signified the \\"[d]eath of the best actor in the show\\", and the South Wales Echo published the obituary: In contrast, however, Laws felt that EastEnders was becoming too depressing, noting that Wellard's death came at the same time Jase was murdered and Honey and her husband Billy (Perry Fenwick) broke up, writing: \\"I feel like slitting my wrists when I tune in now. [...] There's only so much gritty realism we can take in our soaps, and EastEnders is really overloading us at the moment.\\" In 2013, Digital Spy's Naomi Gordon opined that Wellard's death was one of the eight \\"saddest fictional dog deaths\\", saying \\"There wasn't a dry eye in the house.\\" Impact on popular culture Wellard is considered a \\"celebrity\\" dog, and during his EastEnders tenure, the dogs playing him would occasionally make personal appearances at events, including the dog-show Crufts in 1998, a fundraising appeal for the Victoria Animal Hospital in London in 2000, and the first All About Dogs Day at Notcutts garden centre in August 2008. Satirical impression series Dead Ringers referenced Wellard in a 2004 episode, running the continuity announcement: \\"Later on ITV1, new drama featuring the latest EastEnders star we've signed up for a ridiculous advance. Yes Wellard the dog is Barker, a cop on the edge with a drink problem and distemper.\\" For Red Nose Day 2007, Aardman Animations created a Creature Comforts-style short featuring Wellard asking for money for Comic Relief, along with selling his offspring and being put in prison. In January 2012, Wellard appeared (with Dean Gaffney) on Big Brother's Bit on the Side.

Tao is renowned for his witty and humorous teaching style. \\"Philosophy of Love\\" and \\"Death and Immorality\\" are popular courses among students in the Chinese University of Hong Kong.  \\"Philosophy of Love\\"  \\"Analyze love in a solemn philosophical way\\" () is what Tao aimed to do when he started the course \\"Philosophy of Love\\". In philosophy, topics like freedom, death and democracy are widely discussed in depth. Yet, people rarely interpret 'love' in philosophy, probably because philosophers are not experienced in love, and that they like to talk about the love in ethics and morality, but not the love between people. Also, it is difficult for philosophers to analyze ‚ÄúLove‚Äù as it cannot be explained by theories or other rather rational methods. Therefore, Tao aspired to fill the vacuum in philosophy by investigating the unexplored topic of love.  \\"Death and Immorality\\"  Though death is much discussed in the field of philosophy, it is not brought up to a great concern in Hong Kong, because 'death' is a traditional Chinese taboo word, where people do not usually mention it in public but keep it as a topic to be discussed in private. Being diagnosed with nephrosis at an early age, Tao particularly sympathizes with the topic of 'death' where he constantly suffers from pain. Since the 1990s, he has been teaching the course ‚ÄúDeath and Immorality‚Äù and keep modifying it. At first, he attempted to categorize deaths conscientiously, such as chronic disease, suicide, sudden death. Recent years, he switched to a more relaxing and interactive teaching style, in which he would talk about the unfortunate death of male or female protagonists in romantic story, invite masters in Buddhism to share a religious view of death and organize a workshop for students to feel death. Tao has been teaching this course for over twenty years, he concluded his insights about death in a University talk, he said ‚ÄúWhen people talk about death, it is very easy for them to view it as ‚Äòothers‚Äô death, thus neglect its personal meaning. In fact, death is the reflection of humans on their own existence, we should treat it as a memory of life and let it be our motivation to live, it might change your views on the world\\" ().  Writing style  Tao uses terse and clear language to illustrate complex philosophical theories in both Chinese and Western world to readers, such as metaphysics, phenomenal and neo-Confucianism. Since Tao mainly writes about Philosophical theories, he keeps his language in an objective manner and seldom reveals personal feelings in his works. His works are well-structured and served as introductory books to beginners in Philosophy. For instance, in his most up- to-date book Post-80s¬∑The Blind Spot of Love (), incorporated simple ideas in Philosophy, Psychology, and Sociology in analysing the development of mentality in the post-1980s generation. Hence, portrays the phenomenon of love in the post-1980s generation and unlocks their sentimental world. Though Tao uses plain words, his works are poetic and lively, which challenge the perception that Philosophy is meant to be solemn. In The Foreignness of Philosophy () , the famous line \\"Foreignness is the oblivion over a long period of time, they do not know who they are as being long in their bustling real-life. \\" () reflects Tao's use of simple yet beautiful Chinese in explaining Phenomenon in Philosophy. \\"I existed, life in here, it has no beginning or an end, it cannot be depended upon something else, it is the most natural and primitive bounce; it is filled with passion, that needs to be expressed entirely\\" (), gives readers a vivid impression of the excitement in possessing life.

Fausto Orsomarso (regional councillor in Calabria elected with the PdL and re-elected with the new Forza Italia) was appointed coordinator, Pasquale Viespoli (a former senator of the PdL, FLI and National Cohesion) president. Fini did not participate in the party's first press conference and Alemanno was silent, but the symbol was registered by Roberto Menia (a close ally of Fini and former coordinator of FLI), Marco Cerreto (a close ally of Alemanno and splinter from FdI) and Giuseppe Scopelliti (a former President of Calabria who left the PdL in order to join the New Centre-Right in 2013).http://www.agenparl.com/napoli-destra-nasce- azione-nazionale/http://www.iltempo.it/politica/2015/11/10/azione-nazionale-e- la-nuova-an-dei- quarantenni-1.1477426http://www.ilmessaggero.it/PRIMOPIANO/POLITICA/destra_alemanno_meloni/notizie/1670140.shtmlhttp://www.secoloditalia.it/2015/11/nasce- azione-nazionale-per-destra-autonoma-plurale/http://www.romapost.it/roma- elezioni-nasce-azione-nazionale-e-ce-anche- alemanno/http://www.barbadillo.it/49463-destre-nasce-azione-nazionale-i- quarantenni-piu-viespoli-scoppelliti-e-menia/ AN and The Right, Storace's own party, merged into the National Movement for Sovereignty in February 2017.http://www.secoloditalia.it/2017/02/movimento-nazionale-per-la-sovranita- gli-interventi-al-congresso/ The new party elected Alemanno secretary, Menia deputy secretary and Scopelliti coordinator of the national board.http://www.ilgiornaleditalia.org/news/politica/885595/Ecco-il-Movimento- Nazionale-per-la.html However, neither Orsomarso, who had joined the FdI a month earlier,http://lacnews24.it/23921/politica/orsomarso-molla-scopelliti- aderisce-fdi-ultimo-atto-diaspora- destra.htmlhttp://sibarinet.it/index.php/notizie/19-politica/11534-fausto- orsomarso-e-giovanni-dima-aderiscono-a-fratelli-d-italia nor Viespoli joined. Ideology National Action included people with very different political sensibilities, despite being mostly former members of National Alliance. In fact, over the years, Fini had become a staunch Europeanist and much of a social liberal when it came to abortion, LGBT issues, euthanasia, immigration and separation of church and state (in 2010 he broke with Berlusconi and launched his own Future and Freedom party), while Alemanno had always been a representative of the Social Right, whose program included traditional values and suspicion of the free market, and opposed the Euro (he remained a member of the PdL until 2013, after which he briefly joined FdI). According to Fini's remarks, the new AN would be a bulwark of the moderate right as opposed to the one represented by FdI and Lega Nord,http://www.liberadestra.com/fini-sono- pronto-lavorare-per-una-nuova-destra-anti-le-pen-e-di-governo-il-leader- ancora-non-ce/http://www.liberadestra.com/e-ora-un-confronto-di-idee-e-non-di- insulti/ the old AN's nemesis. The party's credo was, however, quite traditional and socially conservative. AN wanted to \\"guarantee Italians first\\", supported life \\"from conception to natural death\\", gave emphasis to Italian sovereignty (and unity), and took a critical approach toward the European Union in its current form.http://www.azionenazionale.it/il-movimento Leadership *Coordinator: Fausto Orsomarso (2015‚Äì2017) *President: Pasquale Viespoli (2015‚Äì2017) External links *Official website References Defunct nationalist parties in Italy Political parties established in 2015 Political parties disestablished in 2017 Defunct political parties in Italy ","title":"National Action (Italy)"},{"id":"48460676","text":"Gregory Eskin (, born 5 December 1936) is a Russian-Israeli-American mathematician, specializing in partial differential equations.homepage of Gregory Eskin at UCLA Department Mathematics (links to recent preprints) Eskin received in 1963 his Ph.D. (Russian candidate's degree) from Moscow State University with thesis advisor Georgiy Shilov.

History  The ship was built by Armstrong, Whitworth & Company, Low Walker Yard and launched in 1917. Along with her sister ships and , they were the first vessels to offer regular transport between Britain and continental Europe for rail freight vehicles. They were ordered by the British Army to provide rail freight transport from the military Port Richborough to the continent to sustain the war effort. They had four sets of rails along the train deck and used a link span to load when in harbour. After their use by the British Army ended in 1922, they were purchased by the Great Eastern Railway and moved to Harwich where the landing stage was re-erected to provide a service to Zeebrugge in conjunction with the Belgian Government through a joint company, the Great Eastern Train Ferry Company. The Great Eastern Railway was taken over by the London and North Eastern Railway company in 1923 with its interest in the Great Eastern Train Ferry Company. The new service was inaugurated on 24 April 1924 by the Duke of Kent. On 13 December 1924 she collided with two lighters in the river near Antwerp but the incident was without loss of life. In 1934, the Great Eastern Train Ferry Company was liquidated and she was bought by the London and North Eastern Railway. In 1940 she was requisitioned by the Royal Navy and renamed Iris. She assisted with the evacuation of the Channel Islands. In 1941 she was converted to a Landing Craft Carrier, and the twin funnels were incorporated into a single stack. In 1942 she was renamed again to Princess Iris. In 1946 she returned to the London and North Eastern Railway and renamed Essex Ferry. She was in service with British Railways from 1948 until 1956 when she was withdrawn from service, renamed Essex Ferry II and then scrapped in 1957.

Jebsen rose to prominence as moderator of his show KenFM with the public broadcaster Rundfunk Berlin-Brandenburg (RBB). After an email with anti-semitic remarks by him became public, he was fired for violating RBB's journalistic standards. Jebsen subsequently launched his own web-portal and YouTube channel also named KenFM. There he mainly publishes \\"alternative views\\" and conspiracy theories, such as about the 9/11 attack and the Coronavirus pandemic.  TV and radio show presenter = First assignments  Ken Jebsen volunteered from 1987 to 1991 under the pseudonym Keks for the private broadcaster Radio Neufunkland in the city of Reutlingen, followed by a job as a reporter at Deutsche Welle TV, where he attracted attention for his spontaneous attitude and his feature banana microphone. In 1994 he secured himself the post of the presenter for a weekly late-night-show at the ZDF, a premier public-service TV broadcaster. Again a reporter, he worked for the Radio 4U show of the largest local Berlin broadcaster SFB. Around this time he landed his first assignment in the morning show team, the Radiofritzen at Radio Fritz. His last brief seasonal tenure took place in 1999 as he joined the team of hosts of the current morning show of ProSieben, a major private TV network.  Radio Fritz and dismissal  Ken Jebsen at the Radio Fritz studio in 2005 From 2001 until 2011 Ken Jebsen served as the host of the popular radio show KenFM at Radio Fritz of the public broadcaster Rundfunk Berlin-Brandenburg (RBB). In 2007, Ken Jebsen and Susanne W√ºndisch won the European CIVIS Radio Prize, awarded in the category Short Programme for their work Irgendwo dazwischen: Portrait of a Young Kurdish Woman in Berlin, broadcast on March 16, 2006 by RBB. The film depicts a young Kurdish teacher and choreographer, born and raised in Berlin, performing the daring and delicate balancing act of living in between both, her traditional Islamic culture and the modern western lifestyle. In early November 2011, an email of Ken Jebsen was published by author Henryk M. Broder, who criticized it for containing anti-Semitic statements. In the email, Jebsen states among other remarks that he knows \\"who invented the Holocaust as a PR stunt\\", he insinuates a connection between Joseph Goebbels, PR-pioneer Edward Bernays, the CIA as well as rich \\"Jews\\" such as Henry Kissinger. RBB initially defended Jebsen against the allegation and on November 9 it was decided to carry on with Ken Jebsen, who was instructed to \\"sensibly check future political issues\\". However, on 23 November 2011 RBB suspended his show and he was eventually dismissed after it had been surmised, that he had violated the broadcaster's journalistic standards on a number of occasions. Although he did not deny having written the email, Jebsen has repeatedly dismissed any allegations of Antisemitism as absurd.  Internet portal  In spring 2012 Jebsen launched his own internet portal named KenFM, which is funded entirely through donations. KenFM mainly publishes \\"alternative viewpoints\\" on contemporary issues and news. The portal is mostly known for publishing a wide range of conspiracy theories. This includes conspiracy theories about the 9/11 attack, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation or the COVID-19 pandemic.  Criticism  Ken Jebsen and the KenFM outlet are regularly subjected to harsh criticism. During his early days after the dismissal from the RBB, he was defended by some commenters. For example, some authors like Evelyn Hecht- Galinski argued that criticism has \\"gone beyond all measures\\" with respect to the fact that the wider debate on the Holocaust, antisemitism and related subjects requires restraint and a high degree of decency in Germany. However, with KenFM mainly publishing disproved conspiracy theories, mainstream media warns of the danger of his disinformation spreading, especially in the light of serious topics such as the Covid-19 pandemic. Since 2014 Ken Jebsen is a keynote speaker at the Vigils for Peace events (). The Vigils for Peace have been criticized for being a gathering place of right-wing populists, nationalists, conspiracy theorists, and anti-semites. In 2017 Ken Jebsen received the Cologne Charlemagne Prize awarded by the \\"Neue Rheinische Zeitung\\" blog for dedicated engagement in literature and journalism. A public awarding event at the Berlin Babylon Theater planned for December 14, 2017 was cancelled upon political protests, that effected an intervention of the city's Culture department.  Personal life  Ken Jebsen was born in 1966 in Krefeld H√ºls as Kayvan Soufi Siavash to a German mother from Hamburg and an Iranian father. As his birth name was obviously too difficult to understand and to pronounce for the majority of the German radio audience, he decided to adopt the stage name Ken Jebsen. The surname supposedly echoes his mothers maiden name. However, according to his own biographical account at Radio Fritz, his birth name was Moustafa Kashefi and he was born on board of a commercial jetliner while traversing Iranian airspace. In a detailed interview with Mathias Br√∂ckers, Jebsen refuted his self-made \\"absurd bio\\" and dismissed it as an easily recognizable joke. Ken Jebsen has three children and lives in Berlin.

It is believed that the son was able to finish the Murugan temple at the foothills, but the father's work on this temple was incomplete. Another variant of the legend states that the father wanted his son to take time to learn the tricks to start his work. Foregoing the orders of the father, the son started chiselling in the inner chamber. Hearing the sound and raged by the disobedience, the father killed the son. There two literal Tamil meanings to Vettuvan Koil, one of which means \\"Heaven of sculptors\\", while the other means the temple of slayer. History Sculpture in the temple The temple is believed to have been built during 8th century around 800 AD. The hill was under the control of Ettaiyapuram Zamindar until 1954. The Raja gifted the village to the Kalugasalamoorthy Temple and formed five streets around the temple to enable the temple car to pass easily. He also allocated a middle street for the temple priests. During the Panguni Uthiram festival procession, the elongated conflict between two castes in the region, namely, Nadars and Maravars resulted in a riots, popularly called Kalugumalai riots of 1895. A total of ten people were killed, many injured and the temple car and other property in the region were destroyed. The sculptures in Vettuvan Koil and the Kalugumalai Jain Beds were not affected during the riots. Architecture The temple is located in Kalugumalai, a rockyhill in Thoothukudi district in southern Tamil Nadu. The temple is carved out from a single rock in a rectangular portion measuring in depth. The carvings in the temple show the top portion of the temple, with an unfinished bottom. The sculptures and the carvings are indicative of Pandyan art during the period. The granite rock looks like a blooming lotus, with hills surrounding it on three sides. The vimana (ceiling over the sanctum) has niches of Parsavadevatas, the attendant deities of Shiva, like ganas, Dakshinamurthy depicted playing a mridanga, Siva with his consort Uma, dancers, various niches of Nandi (the sacred bull of Shiva) and animals like monkeys and lions. Historian Sivaramamurti believes that this is the only place where Dakshinamurthy is depicted playing the Mridanga (a percussion instrument), while in all other places, he is depicted playing Veena. Epigrapher like V. Vedachalam believes that there is a spontaneity in the sculptures indicating of natural human movements like in the Shiva and Uma sculpture where they seem to be talking like common folks. The other portions of Kalugumalai houses the 8th century Jaina Abode and Kalugasalamoorthy Temple, an unfinished Shiva temple. Historians have equated the temple with similar temples across India based on the monolithic classification. Historian K.V. Soundara Rajan believes that the temple is similar in architecture to that of Virupaksha Temple at Karnataka by Vikramaditya II during 734‚Äì44, Kanchi Kailasanathar Temple built by Narasimhavarman II during 685‚Äì705 AD and Kailasa temple, Ellora by Krishna I during 756‚Äì77. Some historians believe that the similarities in the architecture are indicative of the political relations between the Pallavas, Rashtrakutas and Chalukyas, which is highly debatable. alt= Culture Vettuvan Koil is maintained and administered by Department of Archaeology of the Government of Tamil Nadu as a protected monument. Kalugumalai was chosen in the plan to be included as a rural tourism site in Incredible India campaign by the Tourism Ministry of the Government of India. As a part of the campaign the ministry allocated 10 million to develop the infrastructure around the region in 2008. The tourist inflow to the town increased to 3,000 persons per month during 2009 from 400 per month during the previous years.

Its leader was Stefano Fassina. In June 2015 Fassina, a long-time critic of Matteo Renzi, leader of the Democratic Party (PD) and Prime Minister, left the party, followed by his long-time ally Monica Gregori. In July, during a convention, Fassina launched Future to the Left, which aimed at being an embryonic new party to the left of the PD, open to other Democratic splinters, such as those gathered in Giuseppe Civati's Possible, and Left Ecology Freedom (SEL), a political party led by Nichi Vendola. In November one senator (Corradino Mineo) and three deputies (Alfredo D'Attorre, Carlo Galli and Vincenzo Folino) left the PD in protest at Renzi, in order to join the new Italian Left together with Fassina and Monica Gregori of Future to the Left. D'Attorre, who holds a doctorate in philosophy from the Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies, wrote a manifesto for a new \\"labour\\" party, which was signed also by the other five MPs and, among other things, read: \\"The genetic mutation of the PD, born as central force of the Italian centre-left, is unfortunately already completed. The Renzi experience and the introduced mutations won't be a parenthesis. They have already altered in a irreversible way the perception of the PD and its function in the collective imagination.\\" It was also announced that, by the end of the month, joint left-wing parliamentary groups, including SEL, Future to the Left and some splinters of the Five Star Movement, will be formed. Civati, for his part, decided to not take part in the effort. In February 2016 Future to the Left took part to Italian Left's constituent assembly in Rome, where it was announced that the group will be established as a full-fledged party in December. During the assembly, another splinter from the PD, Giovanna Martelli, joined SI, declaring that she needed to \\"go back to the roots\\".

Smithers Hughes (1905‚Äì1987) was an American botanist who developed improved strains of the Valencia orange, a sweet orange that is grown in the United States mainly for the production of commercial orange juice. She was the first woman inducted into the Florida Agricultural Hall of Fame and was also named to the Florida Women's Hall of Fame and the Florida Citrus Hall of Fame. Biography Valencia oranges on the tree. Lena B. Smithers was born June 8, 1905, in Elgin, Tennessee. She earned degrees from both the University of Tennessee and Wayne State University, Michigan, after which she taught school for a time. In 1931, she and her husband Ausker Hughes, a chemist, moved to Lake County, Florida, where they both worked on citrus research. By 1935, they had 75 acres of test groves under production. Together they developed a number of new orange strains that are precursors of widely planted present-day varieties, working especially with nucellar seedlings of Parson Brown and Valencia oranges. After Ausker died in 1944, Hughes continued the breeding research on her own, eventually settling near Orlando in Orange County. This research led to improved, virus-free varieties of the Valencia orange, which had originally been developed by American agronomist William Wolfskill in the mid-19th century. These virus-free strains were used to produce budwood for growers with such success that by 1983, her Hughes Valencia bud line made up some 60 percent of all Valencia oranges propagated for cultivation in Florida. Her work on Valencia oranges has been called \\"one of the most significant citrus developments\\" to originate in Orange County, then one of the nation's major orange-growing regions. She was the first woman member of the Orange County Citrus Extension Advisory Committee‚Äîserving ten years in that capacity‚Äîand likewise the first woman member of the Growers Administrative Committee. In 1960, using money from sales of her Hughes Valencia budwood, Hughes set up the Hughes Memorial Foundation to provide horticulture scholarships at both the University of Florida and Florida Southern College in Lakeland. She was inducted into the Florida Women's Hall of Fame in 1984 and in 1986 became the first woman named to the Florida Agricultural Hall of Fame. In a pair of bad winter freezes in 1984 and 1985, Hughes's last 150 acres of oranges were wiped out and she decided not to replant, knowing that it would take ten years before she could turn a profit and suspecting she did not have that much time left. She died on December 19, 1987. Five years later she was inducted into the Florida Citrus Hall of Fame.

Built about 1895, it is a surviving reminder of the city's railroad-related economic past, built in a distinctive tetrahedral shape to accommodate nearby railroad lines. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. Description and history The Howard Hardware Storehouse is located on the far eastern side of the island formed by the Connecticut River to the east, and the Bellows Falls Canal to the west. It is set north of Bridge Street, east of a modern service station, which separates it from the Adams Gristmill Warehouse, another historic rail- related storage facility. Immediately to its north runs the railroad line of the Boston and Maine Railroad, shortly before it crosses the river into New Hampshire. To its west runs the curving route of a former railroad siding, the tracks now removed, that gave access to the rail yard on the north end of the island. Because of these two lines, the building has a tetrahedral rather than rectangular shape. It is a 1-1/2 story frame structure, with a gable roof and clapboard siding. It is mounted on granite piers, and is oriented with its primary gabled facade facing the former siding to the west. This facade, and the eastern one, each have a single sliding freight door made of beaded vertical boarding; there are also two freight doors on the long north facade. The warehouse was built about 1895, and was originally attached to a coal shed and second storehouse (neither still standing) that belonged to the hardware and farm supply business of L.G. and C.E. Howard, whose retail location was in the main square of Bellows Falls. This location provided easy means for the business to offload goods shipped by rail, and transport them to its store. The building is one of a small number of surviving vernacular commercial structures related to Bellows Falls' railroad-influenced past. According to Cutter's New England Families Genealogical and Memorial (1914), L.G. Howard was born in Lunenberg, Mass in 1822 and was by trade a blacksmith. In 1848, Luther came to Bellows Falls to work in a livery stable, returning to Massachusetts some years later to furnish wood to locomotives and to run a lumber business in Paxton, Mass. In 1877, he returned to Bellows Falls and began working with his son Charles Elliott as hardware dealers. He later was selectman, the first president of the New Bellows Falls Building Association, and a major property owner in Bellows Falls, including the Hotel Windham. Charles was treasurer of the village for 15 years, represented the town in the state legislature, and vice president of the Bellows Falls Trust Company and the Rockingham Hospital Association. In 1895, Luther gave the village of Bellows Falls ten thousand dollars as a memorial to his wife to assist the poor of the village; the Sarah Burr Howard Memorial Fund was dissolved in 2013.

The University of Wisconsin‚ÄìRiver Falls was founded in 1874. The University of Wisconsin‚ÄìRiver Falls' main purpose when first created was to prepare people to have careers in teaching. Over time the demand for more studies increased and UWRF incorporated liberal and fine arts. The University of Wisconsin‚ÄìRiver Falls became a part of the University of Wisconsin system in 1971. In 1897 the Normal school was destroyed by a fire and only a half of day of classes was missed due to the community opening up churches, rooms, and other places to meet so classes could continue. Wisconsin State Standards for Teaching There are ten standards for a licensure to become a teacher in the state of Wisconsin. Teachers must know the subject of subjects they are teaching. This not only means a teacher knows detail of the concepts being taught, but also can apply them to situations appealing to students, helping them to learn better. Teachers also must know how a child grows. Some children take longer to grow and learn things. Teachers should understand that students learn differently. This means that teachers should realize that there are many types of learning styles and cater to all of the learning styles students show in their classroom. Teachers must know how to teach the subject they are teaching. Teachers need to know how to manage a classroom. Teachers need to communicate with others and be able to change their lesson plans to cater to the students they have each year. Teachers know how to test their students and also can assess themselves. Lastly, teachers should be connected with other teachers in their community. Location The university is located thirty minutes from the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul. Students that attend this university get multiple experience of diversity through the different rural, suburban, and urban schools near the area. This university also makes it available that upon completion of a bachelor's degree a graduate will receive their Wisconsin teacher's license. One of the big advantages of going to UWRF means that there is a smaller teacher to student ratio so students have a more personal experience with their professors and feel taken care of. Programs The teaching program at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìRiver Falls offers a variety of majors and minors. These include many departments on campus from dance to art education to areas such as chemistry or economics. The teaching program offers degrees in early childhood, elementary, and secondary education. These three degrees prepare students to become excellent practitioners in their field. The University of Wisconsin‚ÄìRiver Falls is the only public university in the country that has a Montessori graduate program for elementary education. River Falls also is one of two in the nation to offer a graduate-level Montessori program in early childhood education. Common Core The Common Core is supported and thoroughly taught and explained in the teaching program at the University of Wisconsin River Falls. The reason the Common Core is incorporated into the courses is due to the fact that it is being implemented in schools more and more each day. The practices the Common Core outlines are used everyday now in most classrooms and most students do not know how to teach without learning them while taking the main teaching courses in college. Therefore, it is important to include the Common Core as a part of the teaching program because it is imperative to preparing a student to become a great teacher.

At first it was thought Gliniewicz was killed by three unknown assailants, but after two months of investigation officials concluded that Gliniewicz had actually committed suicide after realizing that his many years of criminal activity would soon be exposed. It later was found that he had attempted to arrange the murder of a village administrator who was positioned to uncover his malfeasance. Background Fox Lake, population 10,600, is a village in Grant and Antioch townships in Lake County and Burton Township in McHenry County, Illinois. Gliniewicz, a United States Army veteran, joined the Fox Lake Police Department in 1985. At the time of his death, he was a lieutenant and was scheduled to retire in a month. He was in the United States Army Reserve from 1981 until 2007, leaving with the rank of first sergeant. Incident At 7:52 a.m. on September 1, 2015, Gliniewicz radioed that he was pursuing three men at an abandoned cement plant. After he was found dead later that day, a manhunt was launched for these three men, involving some 400 law enforcement officers on foot, vehicles and horseback. Thousands of people attended Gliniewicz's funeral and Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner ordered flags to half-staff. Many early reactions blamed Gliniewicz's death on a \\"war on cops\\" and Black Lives Matter. Investigation In early September, Joseph Battaglia, a former Chicago police officer, began calling police agencies and media outlets insisting that Gliniewicz had shot himself intentionally. On September 13, Battaglia was charged with disorderly conduct after threatening officials for not declaring Gliniewicz' death a suicide. An investigation concluded that Gliniewicz had been embezzling money for at least seven years from the Fox Lake Police Explorer program (which mentored young people hoping to become law enforcement officers) and believed this embezzlement was about to be exposed, and that his death had been a \\"carefully staged suicide.\\" He had earlier tried to induce someone to kill a village administrator conducting a financial audit of the program. The investigation discovered other serious incidents involving Gliniewicz, including threatening an emergency dispatcher with a gun, allegations of sexual harassment, and numerous suspensions. On January 27, 2016, Gliniewicz's wife was indicted on four counts of disbursing charitable funds without authority and for personal benefit, and two counts of money laundering;Goudie, Chuck Hope, Leah (January 27, 2016). \\"Grand Jury Indicts Fox Lake Officer Widow Melodie Gliniewicz\\", WLS-TV.

History The ship was built by Armstrong, Whitworth & Company Ltd, Low Walker and launched in 1917. Along with her sister ships and , they were the first vessels to offer regular transport between Britain and continental Europe for rail freight vehicles. They were ordered by the British Army to provide rail freight transport from Richborough harbour to the continent to sustain the war effort. They had four sets of rails along the train deck and used a link span to load when in harbour. On 1 February 1919 she was involved in the rescue of British and American soldiers from the American transport Narrangansett which had gone ashore on Bembridge Point, Isle of Wight. In March 1922 she was sent to Ireland to expedite the transfer of surplus Army motor transport. She made several voyages from Cork and Dublin to Liverpool but was back at Plymouth in December. After their use by the British Army ended in 1922, they were purchased by the Great Eastern Railway The Great Eastern Railway was taken over by the London and North Eastern Railway company in 1923 with its interest in the Great Eastern Train Ferry Company. The new service was inaugurated on 24 April 1924 by Prince George, Duke of Kent. In November 1928 the journey from Zeebrugge to Harwich was delayed by a gale and took 23 hours rather than the usual 7 and a half.

Constructed in rock cut architecture, the unfinished temple is believed to have been built during the reign of Pandyan king Parantaka Nedunjadaiya (768-800 CE). The rock-cut architecture at Kalugumalai is an exemplary specimen of Pandyan art. The other portions of Kalugumalai houses the 8th century unfinished Shiva temple, Vettuvan Koil and Kalugasalamoorthy Temple, a Murugan temple at the foothills. There are approximately 150 niches in the bed, that includes images of Gomateshwara, Parshvanatha and other Tirthankaras of the Jainism. The Jain beds are maintained and administered by Department of Archaeology of the Government of Tamil Nadu as a protected monument. History The temple is believed to have been built during 8th century around 800 AD during the reign of Pandya king Parantaka Nedunjadaiya (768-800 CE). Historians believe that the rock cut carvings and the caves are indicative of dwelling of Digambara sect of Jainism in the region. During modern times, some of the Digambaras attempted replacing the idol of Murugan in the lower cave temple with that of Mahavira. The inscriptions in the bed indicate the position of Jain religious women in the society compared to their male counterparts. There are women higher in the monastic order and they travelled to lot of places. There are twenty one religious places mentioned where these women travelled, out of which eleven have been deciphered - one being Kalugumalai itself, five in Ramanathapuram district, one in Tirupanthuruthi in Kanchipuram district, four in Tirucheranm in Kanyakumari district. Some historians believe that Jains promoted education during the early Pandyan Empire. It is understood from the inscriptions that the Pandyan rulers developed an education centre like a Jain University near Kanyakumari exclusively for women. This led to the conclusion that Jainism had more influence on the people in the region than Buddhism. As per the inscriptions, there were around 8,000 Jains living in the regions around Madurai. Jain Yakshini Ambika The hill was under the control of Ettaiyapuram Zamindar until 1954. The Raja gifted the village to the Kalugasalamoorthy Temple and formed five streets around the temple to enable the temple car to pass easily. He also allocated a middle street for the temple priests. During the Panguni Uthiram festival procession, the elongated conflict between two castes in the region, namely, Nadars and Maravars resulted in a riots, popularly called Kalugumalai riots of 1895. A total of ten people were killed, many injured and the temple car and other property in the region were destroyed. The sculptures in Kalugumalai Jain beds and the Jain abode were not affected during the riots. Architecture The temple is in Kalugumalai, a rocky hill in Thoothukudi district in southern Tamil Nadu. The sculptures and the carvings are indicative of Pandyan art during the period. The granite rock looks like a blooming lotus, with hills surrounding it on three sides. There are approximately 150 niches in the bed, that includes images of Gomateshwara, Parshvanatha and other Tirthankaras of the Jainism. Culture Kalugumalai Jain beds is maintained and administered by Department of Archaeology of the Government of Tamil Nadu as a protected monument. Kalugumalai was chosen in the plan to be included as a rural tourism site in Incredible India campaign by the Tourism Ministry of the Government of India. As a part of the campaign the ministry allocated 10 million to develop the infrastructure around the region in 2008. The tourist inflow to the town increased to 3,000 persons per month during 2009 from 400 per month during the previous years.

Their recordings were popular worldwide for a time, although touring outside their Portland, Oregon base was limited. History The Castle Jazz Band started in 1944, part of a West Coast revival of traditional jazz that rebelled against modern jazz. It was named after the Castle, a roadhouse tavern south of Portland (although at the time the group worked there they were simply called \\"Monte Ballou and his Orchestra.\\") The band was a cooperative venture that never paid its members. It was led by banjoist Monte Ballou. The first recordings took place March 28 and April 16, 1944, and their first issue was limited to 200 copies. Wartime and employment difficulties ensured the band would not record again until 1947, but this recording was more widely distributed and garnered the nationwide attention of jazz fans and garnered critical acclaim. Ballou changed from guitar to banjo for the 1947 recording, and this, plus a change from string bass to tuba, had a significant effect on the band's sound. The most famous lineup was formed in 1948, and played music at the Jantzen Beach Amusement Park in Portland, dressed as various characters. They were regulars at the Rathskeller Cafe in 1948, and then moved to a more upscale location, the Sportsman Club, where they were a draw not only locally, but also from the traditional jazz fanbase in San Francisco. Their heyday was from 1949 to 1951. This time period included being a featured group at the 1949 Dixieland Jubilee concert, and a series of recordings on the Castle Records label that began in 1944. Trumpet player Don Kinch claimed one of these records, Floating Down the Old Green River sold more than a million copies. George Bruns left in 1950 to join the Turk Murphy band, and was replaced by initially by George Phillips (who had worked and recorded in the earlier edition of the band), and then by Rod Levitt. Levitt was considered too modern for the band and found it difficult to fit in. The cooperative band broke up in 1951, and Ballou formed a new version of the band that performed in a club he bought called the Diamond Horseshoe, in good part due to the success of the Castle Records releases. Ballou sold the club in 1954 and disbanded Castle in order to briefly join forces with Doc Evans. After his time with Evans Ballou reformed the group and continued to work various venues in the Portland area in addition to private engagements. Members of the 1949-50 band were reassembled in the late 1950s to make two LPs for the Good Time Jazz record label. In the early 1960s, Ballou led the band for a steady engagement in the Roaring 20s club in Harvey Dick's Hoyt Hotel, but when that ended in 1966 Ballou found it difficult to find another steady engagement for the group. He continued to perform sporadically in the Portland area, often as a single act as he had done in his younger days. Periodically he would assemble a six or seven piece for concerts and recordings, including sessions in 1968 and 1972. Style The Castle Jazz Band was an all-white traditional jazz ensemble. It was composed of top-notch musicians who considered themselves neo-traditionalists; as such they rejected big band music as over-arranged and Bebop as the domain of \\"drug-addicted crackpots\\". Castle stuck to what they considered the roots of jazz, consisting of trumpet, clarinet, trombone, tuba, drums, banjo and piano. There were no saxophones or strings. They aimed to emulate the music of Jelly Roll Morton and King Oliver The band was reviewed as \\"rousing\\" and having the ability to impart \\"fire\\" to \\"cornier\\" numbers. Of importance to the band's success was the \\"rhythm and enthusiasm\\" of Ballou, and Kinch's trumpet which could evoke Bix Beiderbecke. Also important was the \\"hell of a good time\\" the band was able to communicate. Individual solos were limited in the Castle band, usually to just a bridge. They were considered to be a \\"superior, authentic, two-beat\\" band. The band was well-rehearsed, but did not come off as overly polished. Of greatest importance was blending of the ensemble work, or as Kinch put it, \\"It's your sound that matters.\\" Impact The Castle Jazz Band was Portland's most popular jazz group, both locally and internationally. In the late 1940s, they were among four groups which were leading the traditional jazz movement on the West coast. George Avakian stated that the band made Oregon \\"a better place to live\\" and considered them the acme of semi-professional jazz groups at the time. Castle Records Castle 8, When the Saints Go Marching In Castle Records was founded to release the band's records. The first recording, from 1944, was issued in a quantity limited to 200 copies, and a second release was even more limited at 50 copies. The label's first issues were primitive sounding, but as recording engineer Harry Fosbury continued, the sound quality improved. In addition to the Castle Jazz Band, Castle Records also released four piano solos by Lee Stafford. The recordings for the label took place between 1944 and 1950.

Vanita asks \\"Why should the state's refusal to recognise a union as marriage mean that the union is not a marriage?\\" Vanita emphasises the history of recognition of same-sex love, and notes that, based on her expert knowledge of ancient Indian texts, same-sex love and relationships are \\"deeply rooted in Indian culture\\". Vanita discusses the cultural and legal implications of same- sex marriage in India and the West. Reception In India Today Sonya Dutta Choudhury praised the book, describing it as \\"impeccably scholarly\\" and a \\"persuasive case\\". However, whilst praising the academic value of the book, Choudhury also wrote that \\"The book with its wide and wandering thesis is an excellent handbook for the activist or the student of gender. For the rest, reading Alan Hollinghurst's lyrical prose or Jeanette Winterson's intense drama is an infinitely more enjoyable way of recognising the reality of same- sex love and a consequent case for marriage\\" Terry Castle, Professor at Stanford University and editor of The Literature of Lesbianism also gave a positive review, describing the book as \\"absorbing\\" and noting how it \\"shows how subtly and imaginatively Indian attitudes toward same-sex unions have evolved over the centuries-and offers a marvelously global perspective characterised by profound historical understanding, impeccable scholarship, and a rare and delightful precision of feeling\\" References 2005 non-fiction books LGBT literature in India Books about same- sex marriage 2000s LGBT literature ","title":"Love's Rite"},{"id":"48461361","text":"Classroom Assessment Techniques, also referred to as CATs, are strategies educators use to gauge how well students are comprehending key points during a lesson or a course. The techniques are meant to be a type of formative assessment that also allow teachers to make adjustments to a lesson based on students' needs. CATs are most commonly ungraded, unanimous, and are conducted during class time. Background The incorporation of classroom assessment techniques is an age-old concept which teachers have been using and practicing for years. Whether a teacher uses a technique learned in training, or simply a strategy conjured up on their own, teachers need to know if their methods are successful and many feel that the desire to understand students' comprehension is instinctive. Despite this innate characteristic among teachers, the first real attempt to document such techniques for teachers didn't appear until 1988, when K. Patricia Cross and Thomas A. Angelo published ‚ÄúClassroom Assessment Techniques: A Handbook for Faculty‚Äù. Benefits for teachers By using feedback attained through CATs, teachers gain insight into which concepts their students understand the best and which ones are most confusing. They can then use this information to decide when there needs to be more instruction, and when the class is ready to move on to the next topic. In this way, teachers are able to meet the needs of their students most effectively. These techniques can also help teachers understand the ways their students learn the best, as well as alert teachers when a certain teaching approach is not working very well. Other benefits include flexibility and timeliness. Many of the techniques, although not all, can be used in a variety of ways. They can be adapted to fit large or small class sizes, or modified depending on what subject matter is being taught; they can be used to assess students' recall or critical thinking skills. Also, CATs require very little time, if any, to be set aside - most of the activities can be conducted during regular instruction time. Benefits for students Classroom Assessment Techniques allow students a chance to see how they are progressing over time. Along with that, it shows students that their feedback can make a difference in what and how they learn, which in turn could lead students to take more ownership of their education. Students have reported that they feel more involved in the learning process when these techniques are used in the classroom because it requires them to focus on what they're learning ‚Äì they become active participants rather than passive learners. The integration of CATs in the classroom can also serve as an example for how learning is an ongoing, highly adaptable process. Examples=Background Knowledge Probe The Background Knowledge Probe consists of a few simple questions (and perhaps a couple focused ones) asked typically before the start of a unit or when introducing a new important topic. The purpose of this questionnaire is to inform the teacher of how much prior knowledge students have on a specific subject matter. This will help the teacher figure out an effective starting point for the lesson as well as an appropriate level of instruction. While this strategy is most often used as an introduction to a lesson, it can also be beneficial halfway through and at the end to see what the students have learned. This particular technique can be easily modified to fit any subject matter ‚Äì history, science, math, English, music, and so on. For example, a question that might be found on a Background Knowledge Probe questionnaire would be: \\"Explain what you know about the Louisiana Purchase.\\" Traffic Light Cards The teacher distributes one red card and one green card to each student. Then, during the lesson while instruction is taking place, students can hold up either card to show how well they understand. If the teacher sees his or her students holding up all green cards, they know to continue their lesson. If the students are holding up red cards, the teacher knows that something was unclear and needs to be discussed further. This type of immediate feedback is helpful for the teacher to see how well students are learning, and it also gives the students an opportunity to engage and take control of their learning. This technique is typically practiced in elementary classrooms, although it can also be effective at the middle school and high school grade levels. Another version of traffic light card has been recently developed in higher education. A few minutes before the end of lecture, students ‚Äútraffic light‚Äù given topics on a notecard, in which their understanding is high (green), partial (yellow), or low (red). The results are used by the instructors to give appropriate review in the next lecture and help students gain better understanding in the content. Muddiest Point The Muddiest Point is another general CAT that can be used for any subject in any grade level. When using this technique, the teacher instructs students to briefly state what part of the lesson or assignment was most confusing for them. This allows the teacher to figure out which areas need to be reiterated. Reviewing every area that each student felt was unclear is a lot of work, and teachers may find themselves simply teaching the entire lesson all over again. As an alternative, teachers should focus on the top two or three most common responses. This technique also requires students to learn how to articulate their confusion, a useful skill.  What‚Äôs the Principle?  This method is effective in courses that call for problem-solving. Students determine the nature of the problem and decide on the theory to apply.  Problem Recognition Task  The rationale is to pinpoint issues that can be solved effectively using teaching methods in the classroom. The students must name the technique that suits the problem without solving said concern.  Student Generated Test Questions  These questions may be utilized one or two weeks before an examination. The teacher writes broad guidelines about the types of questions for the tests and shares them with students so they can answer at least one or two of these questions expected to appear on the actual exams.  Classroom Opinion Polls  The teacher formulates brief two up to four items of questionnaires in helping find out opinions of students about issues related to the course.  Memory Matrix  This is a fundamental two- dimensional illustration or table. The rectangle is divided into rows and columns to systematize information as well as define relationships. It helps evaluate the students‚Äô recollection of vital course content and skills in organizing information into different categories the teacher supplies.

Along with her sister ships and , they were the first vessels to offer regular transport between Britain and continental Europe for rail freight vehicles. They were ordered by the British Army to provide rail freight transport from Richborough harbour to the continent to sustain the war effort. They had four sets of rails along the train deck and used a link span to load when in harbour. On 1 February 1919 she was involved in the rescue of British and American soldiers from the American transport Narrangansett which had gone ashore on Bembridge Point, Isle of Wight. After their use by the British Army ended in 1922, they were purchased by the Great Eastern Railway The Great Eastern Railway was taken over by the London and North Eastern Railway company in 1923 with its interest in the Great Eastern Train Ferry Company. The new service was inaugurated on 24 April 1924 by Prince George, Duke of Kent. In 1934, the Great Eastern Train Ferry Company was liquidated and she was bought by the London and North Eastern Railway. In 1940 she was requisitioned by the Royal Navy and renamed HMS Daffodil. In 1941 was converted to a Landing Craft carrier. She was sunk on 18 March 1945 off Dieppe, Seine Maritime, France.

He was signed by the Seattle Seahawks as an undrafted free agent in 2015. He played college football at Ohio State. Early years Smith attended Paul Harding High School, where he received All-state and player of the year honors as a senior. He graduated after rushing 1,000 times for a SAC conference career rushing record of 6,625 yards and 66 touchdowns. As a senior, he also was an All-conference basketball player and was a part of the state's runner-up 4 √ó 100 metres relay team. College career Smith accepted a football scholarship from Ohio State University as a highly rated recruit. As a redshirt freshman, he appeared in 10 games, opening the season against the University of Akron with 18 carries for 74 yards and one touchdown. The next week against the University of Toledo he started to show a fumble problem, diminishing the coaching staff confidence in him. His production was limited the rest of the season behind Dan Herron, Carlos Hyde and Jordan Hall. He registered 29 carries for 116 yards and one touchdown, while playing mainly on special teams. He was also suspended after missing the team flight to the 2012 Gator Bowl. As a sophomore, he was a backup behind Hyde and Jordan, appearing in 12 games with 32 carries for 215 yards and two touchdowns. He led the team in kickoff returns (13), total return yards (303) and return average (23.3). His best game came against Penn State University, tallying 4 carries for 48 yards. As a junior, he was suspended for an undisclosed offseason incident for the season opener against the University at Buffalo. He fell back in the running back rotation behind Hyde, Jordan, Dontre Wilson and Ezekiel Elliott. He recorded 22 carries for 117 yards (5.3-yard average) and one touchdown. As a senior, he missed most of spring camp for academic reasons. He still emerged as the team's goal line running back behind sophomore starter Elliott, posting 24 carries for 101 yards and 4 touchdowns, while also contributing on special teams. On October 27, he was dismissed from the football team after a failed drug test and decided to declare for the NFL Draft. He finished his college career with 549 rushing yards on 107 carries with ten touchdowns. Professional career=Seattle Seahawks Smith was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Seattle Seahawks after the 2015 NFL Draft on May 2. He was waived on September 5 and signed to the practice squad the next day. On October 10, he was promoted to the active roster to provide depth while running backs Marshawn Lynch and Fred Jackson recovered from injuries. He played in one game against the Cincinnati Bengals, rushing for five yards on two carries. He was released on October 13. Dallas Cowboys2015 season= On October 14, 2015, he was claimed off waivers by the Dallas Cowboys. He became the third-string running back after Joseph Randle was released on November 3. He appeared in 10 games, playing mainly on special teams and having one kickoff return for 26 yards. =2016 season= In 2016, Smith was moved to fullback during OTAs, although he did not have the traditional size and body. He competed with converted linebacker Keith Smith for the position and both made the team, although Rod was used only for special teams purposes. On November 3, after injuries to Morris Claiborne and Barry Church, the Cowboys were forced to release him to make room for cornerback Leon McFadden. Smith was re-signed to the practice squad two days later. At the time, he was tied for second on the team with four special teams tackles. =2017 season= Smith with the Cowboys in 2017 Smith signed a reserve/future contract with the Cowboys on January 16, 2017. In 2017, he returned to running back behind Ezekiel Elliott, Alfred Morris, and Darren McFadden. During the preseason, he was moved up to third-string because of his improved play and production on special teams. On September 17, in week 2 against the Denver Broncos, Smith had his first two carries with the Cowboys, which went for eight yards during a 42‚Äì17 defeat. When Elliott was suspended for six games for violating the league‚Äôs personal conduct policy, Smith ended up earning more playing time behind Alfred Morris. On Thanksgiving Day against the Los Angeles Chargers, Smith scored his first professional touchdown on a 2-yard rush. He finished the game with 41 rushing yards, a rushing touchdown, and seven receiving yards. During Week 13 against the Washington Redskins, Smith ran for 27 yards and a touchdown as the Cowboys won by a score of 38-14. In the next game against the New York Giants, Smith had 47 rushing yards and a touchdown along with 113 receiving yards, including an 81-yard touchdown reception, helping secure a 30-10 win. During Week 15 against the Oakland Raiders, Smith rushed for 13 yards and a touchdown as the Cowboys narrowly won by a score of 20-17. When Elliott returned from his suspension in Week 16 against the Seattle Seahawks, Smith's productivity dropped since he only rushed for 10 yards in that game. He was declared inactive for the last game against the Philadelphia Eagles, after battling an illness and a sore back. Smith finished the season with 55 carries for 232 yards, 4 rushing touchdowns, 19 receptions, 202 receiving yards, and a receiving touchdown. =2018 season= Smith wasn‚Äôt a factor on offense as the backup running back, but maintained his role as a core special teams player. His most action on offense came in the season finale against the New York Giants, registering 12 carries for 35 yards and one touchdown, when starter Ezekiel Elliott sat out to rest for the playoffs. His numbers decreased from the previous season to 44 carries for 127 yards and one touchdown. New York Giants On May 8, 2019, Smith signed with the New York Giants. He was placed on injured reserve on August 31, 2019. He was released from injured reserve with an injury settlement on September 10.

Harbison (1904-1989) was an American entomologist and the curator of entomology at the San Diego Natural History Museum from 1942 to 1969. An avid field naturalist and researcher, Harbison influenced a generation of San Diego-born scientists in many fields of natural history through the Junior Naturalist program at the museum.  Biography  Charles Francis Harbison was born on January 12, 1904 in National City, California to Carrie Lincoln Floyd and David F. Harbison. He was descended from San Diego County pioneer families: his paternal grandfather, John S. Harbison, was a commercially successful beekeeper; his maternal grandfather, Ira Floyd, was among the earliest settlers (a fruit rancher) in National City, south of San Diego. Harbison grew up in National City and (briefly) in the Imperial Valley, where his father was a farmer and poultry rancher and provided sightseeing tours into Baja California. After a year attending San Diego State College, Harbison moved to Los Angeles and worked in the Los Angeles School‚Äôs Division of Nature Study for five years, attending classes at the University of California southern branch (now UCLA). He went on to study entomology at the University of California, Berkeley, under Professors E.O. Essig, S. B. Freeborn, and W. B. Herms and invertebrate zoology under Joseph Grinnell, taking his B.A. degree in 1933. Harbison returned to San Diego following the death of his father. In 1934, Harbison was hired (via WPA funding) by the Entomology Department of the San Diego Natural History Museum. Throughout the Depression, Harbison maintained the museum‚Äôs entomology collections and participated in many of the museum‚Äôs research expeditions, including field work in Baja California, Organ Pipe National Monument (working as assistant to zoologist and Curator of Birds and Mammals Laurence M. Huey), and other sites in southwestern Arizona. From 1939 to 1949, Harbison conducted nature study programs at the museum for the San Diego City Schools. In 1943, when the U.S. Navy occupied the museum, Harbison moved part of the entomology collection and his junior naturalist educational materials to the Brooklyn Grammar School in San Diego, maintaining a ‚ÄúChildren‚Äôs Museum,‚Äù teaching, and leading field trips for young naturalists throughout the war. After the war, Harbison resumed his research expeditions, studying insects (especially Odonata) and plants of Baja California, and focused his collecting on the Ca√±on del Cantil (Cantillas and its north fork, Tajo Ca√±on) in the Sierra de Juarez. Harbison participated in extended research trips from 1952 to 1968, including five visits to Guadalupe Island, Mexico and the 1958 Scripps Institution of Oceanography expedition to Barro Colorado Island, Panama, and Clipperton Island, Mexico. On Clipperton Island (a desolate atoll 900 miles south of Baja California), Harbison found 13 orders of insects as well as spiders and other arthropods. In 1962, Harbison was a member of the Belvedere Expedition to the Gulf of California, an important ecological survey of 32 islands; on that expedition, he amassed a collection of 10,000 arthropod specimens for the museum. While Harbison‚Äôs scientific publications are limited in number, the variety of his natural history interests is reflected in the patronyms proposed in his honor, including those of two plants, Verbena harbisonii Moldenke, 1940 (now Glandularia lilacina), and Astragalus harbisonii Barneby, 1953; a mouse, Peromyscus guardia harbisoni Banks, 1967; a bee, Centris harbisoni Snelling, 1974; a butterfly, Euphyes vestris harbisoni Brown and McGuire, 1983; a yucca skipper, Megathymus yuccae harbisoni J. & T.

A pre- assessment, is a way to save teachers time within the classroom when teaching new material. It is a great way to find out more about the students, what they are interested in and how they learn best. There are many types of best teaching practices. One of them is pre-assessment, which helps teachers better understand their students when preparing lessons, and activities to better fit the students in the class. Pre-assessment is a test that can be administered at the beginning of the school year and before new units. The same test may also be used for the post-assessment. Pre-assessment also helps the teacher learn student's interests and individual learning styles of each student. There are many ways to differentiate instruction for students that will help students take in information in multiple ways. All this information can be organized in a way to help the students and teachers have an easier school year. It can take place at the beginning of the school year and also before each unit. Differentiated instruction Some teachers assume best practices in their classroom, include such things as students sitting on the floor, listening to music, drawing, being loud or being quiet but doing so as a class. Because these students are doing these things as a class it is not differentiated Instruction. Amy Benjamin writes differentiated instruction is a \\"variety of classroom practices that allow for differences in students' learning styles, interests, prior knowledge, socialization needs and comfort zones\\".Benjamin, Amy. 2003. Differentiated instruction: A guide for Elementary School Teachers. Larchmont, NY: Eye on Education. To learn students individual needs we as teachers need to assess those students and pre-assessment can to be done at the beginning of the school year and to identify students learning modalities, interests and readiness for content. Modalities There are two types of modality theories; one is learning styles theory, the other is multiple intelligence. Learning style theory suggests that learning styles differ from student to student. A few examples of learning styles are active learners, verbal learners, and reflective learners. Learning styles theory is highly criticized and lacks empirical evidence to support it. Another type of modality is multiple intelligence, which was created by Howard Gardner. He takes a physiological approach to multiple intelligence by breaking it into eight categories. These categories help teachers understand the different types of diverse learning abilities. First is logical/mathematical which means the student learns better with logic, reasoning and numbers. Verbal/ Linguistic is another way that the students' strengths are with words and language. Another type is visual/spatial in which a student would rather use graphs, charts and drawings. Students who enjoy sound, rhymes, and music are musical/rhythmical learners. Bodily/kinesthetic learners are better with their hands and have better control over their bodily motions. Another type is Naturalist/Environmental, these students are sensitive, nurturing and like to use all five sense. The seventh is interpersonal, a type of student who communicates well and can be an extrovert. Last, students who can self-reflect and are introverts they are intrapersonal learners. Multiple intelligence is a great way to separate students out and learn their best learning modality. Interests During pre-assessment, teachers have to learn about students' interests and readiness for the content in order to help motivate the students. However, students have to be the ones who motivate themselves. We as teachers have to grab their attention by utilizing what we know about their interests. Once we know the students interests we can integrate it into the lesson plans. Lynda Rice uses the example that if a student has trouble writing complete sentences use his interests to help him become motivated. A way to do that is by incorporating the students favorite things, which in this case was a superhero. The student was told to write conversation bubbles between other superheroes or even the villains. This helped him become motivated to write complete sentences. Readiness for content The purpose of pre-assessment of readiness is to find out what the students know and don't know to help plan your lessons to your specific students each year. Every year teacher's students are different. You may not be able to teach the same units the same way because of the classes readiness. At the beginning of the year and before new units it would be best to do a pre-assessment of the students to see what they know. The teachers should also give parents an evaluation in the beginning of the year because they know their child best. Planning and preparing for a class day is difficult, having these pre-assessments done will help you spend more time teaching students what they don't know and just refreshing them on what they do already do know. For example, if you are going to be starting a new unit in math, how to add and subtract. Just by asking the students \\"What does addition mean?\\", \\"What does subtraction mean\\" and, \\"Do they relate to each other?\\", the teacher would be able to know that the students had a good basic knowledge of the information and could start on application-based activities. Doing pre-assessment before each unit could help teachers using their time teaching students new information and save time by not teaching them what they may already know with remediation. There are many examples of ways to determine the classes understanding of different subjects. They can be used with formative and summative assessments not just pre- assessment. Once the teacher has decided on the next unit of study they can have the students trace their hands on a piece of paper. On one hand they can write 5 things they already know about the subjects and on the other hand they can write what they wish to know about the subject. This can be done with partners or individually. Teachers can use this to plan the unit and could also use it as another activity by having the students research and answer their own questions. Teachers can also create a worksheet or use note cards to have the students do as homework to get into the classroom the next day. Just asking them \\"What do you know about the topic?\\", \\"Is this topic interesting to you?\\". Another way is to give the class a test and go over the answers with them, allowing them to correct their own test and find prior knowledge. Using end-of-unit tests can be a great thing for the students; it helps them recognize the important parts of the upcoming unit. There are many ways to find out what students know about subjects that will help you better prepare and spend time wisely within the classroom.Rice, L. (2013). Pre-Assessment. In Common sense assessment in the classroom (pp. 25-46). Huntington Beach, CA: Shell Education. Evaluating Pre-assessment should always be evaluated but never with grades (Rice, 2013). Teachers should use checkmarks, symbols and highlighter to help find where the students need the most instruction. These assessments should be used to create teachers lesson plans and help the teacher find the best approach for the new unit. The best way to assess is to use graphic organizers, which will be described greater detail below. Evaluation is an ongoing process throughout the school year. As the students learn and grow so will their knowledge and abilities.Hall, T. (2002). Differentiated instruction. Wakefield, MA: National Center on. There was a study done about India curriculum and that evaluated the effectiveness of pre- and post- assessment. Overall the findings showed that pre- and post assessment had a positive effect on the students learning. The student had increased their average score 11% from the pre-assessment to post. In pre- assessment they were given a subjective method of asking what they already know or do not know about the subject. They also were given an assessment that was an objective method that asked yes/no questions. For example, was the information was easy to understand, useful, and well organized.Jin, Byoungho, & Bennur, Shubhapriya. (2012). Curriculum Internationalization Focusing on India: Pre- And Post-Assessment of Student Learning. Journal of Teaching in International Business, 23(1), 31-45. Organizing data Graphic organizers may be the best way to organize the data from pre-assessment. Making a prescription for differentiation sheet is a great way to do that. It incorporates all the data into four categories, such as learning styles, multiple intelligences, interests and readiness for content. Each student would have here own sheet filled out and can be used for planning lessons throughout the year. These are great for students who are bored, or unmotivated. These sheets can also be used for creating groups for the class and finding students that may work well together. Teachers must also organize their classroom management and delivery strategies to effectively operate a classroom with differentiated instruction. Learning cycle To summarize pre-assessment is a great way to start off the school year, whether it is a test or a worksheet is up to the teacher. For starting a new unit having it be a pre-test would be in the best interest of the students and the teacher. This way the teachers can use the same test for the pre- and post-assessment. This will allow students to know what will be on the test and also allow teachers to know what they need to spend more time on. One option you may decide to add onto the pre-assessment of a new unit would be a choice of \\"I do not know\\". Showing the student that it is all right to not know the correct answer. After the pre-assessment is complete teachers need to evaluate and organize that data, and create or adjust their lesson plan. Teachers may use the pre- assessment from the beginning of the year to create groups for projects or create a new activity based on the students interests. Once the students are taught and are ready to be assessed again the teacher may make a new test or use the pre-assessment again. Pre-assessment can be used in many ways and can be effective in any classroom if used properly.

It was held to protest segregation laws and racial inequality and was one of several protests held during the month of June. It attracted veteran protesters from out of town, such as Ivanhoe Donaldson, Avon Rollins, Robert Zellner and Dorthy Miller (Zellner) of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. The events received widespread criticism from national media, especially for the subsequent trials overseen by Judge Archibald M. Aiken. During the day thirty- eight protesters were arrested and jailed for their participation in the protests. In response fifty protesters gathered at the city jail to hold a prayer vigil that evening. Participants at the vigil were attacked by the town's police and deputized citizens using billy clubs and water hoses. Sixty- five people were taken to the town's African-American hospital as a result of the events of that day. Forty-seven of the victims were people attending the prayer vigil. Martin Luther King Jr. visited Danville to support the demonstrators on July 11, 1963, but chose not to hold a march. Judge Aiken began trying the arrested protesters on June 17. His handling of the cases of those arrested has received criticism from several people and organizations such as the United States Department of Justice. During the trials Aiken refused to give out bills of particulars or grant continuances or bail. He also announced guilty verdicts from a pre-typed script and made it nearly, if not completely, impossible for the defendants to appeal their sentences.

It is used to assign tasks, track project progress, manage calendars, share documents, and manage other work, using a tabular user interface.  Features  Smartsheet is used to collaborate on project timelines, documents, calendars, tasks, and other works. According to IDG, it is \\"part office productivity, part project management, part document sharing... [it] is trying to be the central hub for how people work.\\" Smartsheet competes with Microsoft Project. It combines some of the functionality of Microsoft Project, Excel, Access and SharePoint. According to Forbes, Smartsheet has \\"a relatively simple\\" user interface. The interface centers on \\"smartsheets,\\" which are similar to spreadsheets typically found in Microsoft Excel. Each smartsheet can have its rows expanded or collapsed to see individual tasks or large-scale project progress respectively. Tasks can be sorted by deadline, priority or the person assigned to them. If a spreadsheet contains dates, Smartsheet creates a calendar view. Each row in a smartsheet may have files attached to it, emails stored within it, and a discussion board associated with it. When a new smartsheet is created, notifications are pushed out to staff to populate its rows and columns. As information is updated, other smartsheets tracking the same task, project or data-point are updated automatically. The service also has alerts for when a task deadline is coming up, and keeps track of document versions. Smartsheet can import data from Microsoft Office or Google applications. It integrates with Salesforce.com, Dropbox and Amazon Web Services. There is also a Smartsheet mobile app for Android and iOS operating systems. The service is offered on a subscription basis with no free tiers.  History  Smartsheet's original user interface in 2006 Smartsheet was developed in 2005 and introduced to the public in 2006. According to the company's co-founder, Brent Frei, initial adoption was slow because the offering was too difficult to use. At the end of its first year, it had only 10,000 users. The company began making changes to the SmartSheet in 2008, eventually cutting 60 percent of its features for the purpose of making it more user-friendly. Following the 2010 launch of the redesign, the adoption grew to 1 million users at 20,000 organizations by 2012. Integration with Office 365 and Microsoft Azure were added in 2014. In October, the Account Map tool was introduced, which uses an algorithm to visualize the flow of work across groups of employees. In August 2014, version 2.0 of the Smartsheet iOS app was introduced. The spreadsheet- like user, which was part of the web service, was introduced to the iOS app in this version; the developers have not been able to build this feature in the mobile version before. In 2015, Smartsheet started introducing closer integrations with Microsoft Office products, following the changes Microsoft was made in their products to work better with third-party software. In January 2015, Smartsheet added support for Azure Active Directory, Microsoft's cloud-based directory service that allowed users to log into products like Excel and Smartsheet with the same login. This allowed users to make changes to smartsheets directly from Microsoft Outlook. In 2016, Smartsheet introduced Sights, a configurable dashboard that shows metrics such as how a team is performing against key performance indicators.

History  In January 2008, Luke Robinson, who is from Texas, and his two dogs made a cross-country journey in honor of his Great Pyrenees, Malcolm, who died of bone cancer in 2004. He walked his two other dogs, Hudson and Murphy, from Austin, Texas to Boston, Massachusetts, town to town, to educate others on canine cancer. They started a nationwide grassroots movement. \\"Mr. Robinson had a vision: 2,000,000 dogs walking simultaneously all across the United States for cancer.

Canine cancer Along with humans, companion animals can develop cancer too. They can get brain, breast, bone & lung cancer; lymphoma and melanoma, as well as others. Scientists have discovered that the cells are biologically comparable. With comparative oncology studies, more companion animals have access to the drug candidates available. The National Canine Cancer Foundation has a list of canine cancers. Puppy Up! walks Puppy Up! walks are 2 mile walks that fundraise for cancer research as well as promote awareness of canine cancers. Members from the community where a walk is being held are able to volunteer at the event by helping set up and other tasks for the event.

Life=Early life Shin Dong-yup was born on August 18, 1930, in Buyeo, South Chungcheong Province, Korea. In 1944, he graduated from Buyeo Elementary School at the head of his class and then attended Jeonju Normal School. The tuition, room and board were paid by the Korean government. According to the book, National Poet Shin Dong-yup by the poet Kim Eung-gyo, his father, Shin Yeon-sun, discovered his talent for writing. Despite their poverty, his father taught him how to write when Shin Dong-yup was six years old. School life In 1948, Shin Dong-yup was expelled from the Normal School as a consequence of student protests against Syngman Rhee, and in particular for disagreeing with the South Korean president's land reform policy and inaction on liquidating pro-Japanese assets. He was transferred to teach at an elementary school in Buyeo, as he was already certified as a teacher. However, he quit his job and entered Dankook University, majoring in history. His father was a judicial scrivener, but he could not support his son financially with his low pay, so he had to sell his farm. Korean War Shin Dong-yup had to return to his hometown when the Korean War broke out in 1950. The North Korean People's Army took over Buyeo on July 15, 1950. The North Korean People's Army intended to implement communist land reform. Shin Dong-yup was not interested in political issues, but he was employed by the Democratic and National Youth Alliance and worked there until late September 1950. The army exploited his knowledge of organization and business. He agreed with communist ideas regarding social reforms, although he was an anarchist. He was drafted into the National Defense Corps in late 1950. After the dissolution of the army, he caught liver distoma from eating crabs. Debut as a writer In 1953, Shin Dong-yup applied to become an air force candidate and passed. However, after graduation from Dankook University, he remained unassigned to a billet. He then moved to Donam-dong, Seongbuk-gu, Seoul, and opened a secondhand bookstore near his home. At that time, Shin Dong-yup met his future wife, In Byung-sun, who was a senior at Ewha Girls' High School. He married In Byung-sun and they returned to his hometown. In Byung-sun opened a boutique in Buyeo to overcome poverty, and Shin Dong-yup was assigned to Joosan Agriculture High School in Boryeong, South Chungcheong Province. He quit teaching because of tuberculosis, and fell into reading and writing after he sent his wife and children to stay with his wife's parents. In 1959, he won The Chosun Ilbo annual spring literary contest with The Talking Ploughman's Earth, and he made his debut as a writer under his pen name, Seok Lim. He recovered from tuberculosis and started working at Education Criticism Publisher in Seoul. He wrote Student Revolution collection of poems and protested in the April Revolution. This is why Shin Dong-yup is often referenced as the \\"April Revolution poet\\" by many writers. He was able to write \\"Who Said Who Looked Up At The Sky\\" and \\"Husk, Be Gone\\" based on his experiences in the April Revolution. In 1961, he was hired as a teacher for an evening section at the Myung-Sung Girls' High School, where he immersed himself in writing poems. He graduated from Konkuk University's graduate school with a master's degree in Korean Literature in 1964. In 1963, he published a poetry collection, Asanyeo, and an epic poem, Keumkang. His liver distoma worsened, and this eventually turned into liver cancer. He died at age 38 on April 7, 1969. Education * Buyeo Elementary school * Jeonju Normal school * Dankook University * Konkuk University graduate school Poems Shin Dong-yup published many poems such as \\"Husk, Be Gone\\", which criticized the opportunists swept up by democratic power and also \\"March\\", \\"Farm\\", and \\"The Sky We Saw\\". He wrote epic poems, including The Talking Ploughman's Earth, Woman's Life, and more than ten critiques. In 1989, his poem \\"On the hills and mountains\\" was included in middle school textbooks. The following is a Korean to English translation of his most famous poem, \\"Husk, Be Gone\\".

Following a bomb attack by an activist from the party, the NF was dissolved in 1979 and succeeded by the National People's Party (Nasjonalt Folkeparti, NF), which itself was dissolved in 1991 after several leading members had received long prison sentences. The NF had around 1,400 members at its peak. History The NF was founded in 1975 as a successor to the minor National Youth League (Nasjonal Ungdomsfylking, NUF), affiliated with former members of Nasjonal Samling. It was founded by a young generation of neo-Nazis, nationalists and anti-communists, and areas of focus included opposition to immigration, fight against the Workers' Communist Party as well as \\"American finance capital\\", and Holocaust denial. After being prevented from registering publicly as a political party, and following repeated attacks from anti-fascists, the group turned towards violence and terrorism which garnered much media attention. The party had links to the French National Front and the World Anti-Communist League (WACL). The 12th WACL general conference in Paraguay in 1979 was attended by a delegate from the party, whose journey was reportedly subsidised by the leader of the Arab delegation Sheikh Ahmed Salah Jamjoom. Some members of the party reportedly fought with Rhodesian Security Forces in the Rhodesian Bush War. The NF was dissolved in 1979 after an activist from the group threw a homemade bomb against the annual May Day demonstration, leaving two people wounded. Not long after the party was succeeded by the National People's Party, effectively the same party. Opposition to immigration became its main focus. Bl√ºcher however stepped down as leader in 1981 to pursue extreme-right connections abroad. On 13 June 1985 a young activist from the party detonated a bomb outside an Oslo Ahmadiyya mosque. Several of the party's leading members received prison sentences in the aftermath of the bombing for various activist offences. The party was dissolved in 1991, and remaining members were encouraged to join the Fatherland Party.

He was then shot dead by university police. Mohammad's history was put under investigation by federal authorities due to questions raised about possible lone-wolf terrorism. The Federal Bureau of Investigation concluded that Mohammad was inspired to commit the attack by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS), and that the attack was an act of lone-wolf terrorism. Attack The attack began at about 8:00 a.m. Pacific Time, and was over in about fifteen minutes. The first attacks took place near the center of campus, inside a classroom at the Classroom and Office Building, then continued outside the building until Mohammad was shot by UC Merced police officers. Two of the victims were airlifted to hospital; two were treated on campus for minor injuries. Merced County Sheriff Vern Warnke stated that the weapon used in the attack was a hunting knife between 8 and 10 inches in length. The planned attack (see below) was thwarted by a student, Tyler Patton, and construction worker, Byron Price, who was working in a nearby hallway. During Mohammad's initial attack, Patton attacked him with classroom furniture, disrupting the attack. Mohammad then tried to flee the room and ran into Price as Price was entering. Mohammad stabbed him in the side, then ran out of the room and down the stairs, attempting to stab more students as he fled. He then rushed out of the building and attacked a member of the University staff, stabbing her several times. Mohammad then fled across the Scholar's Lane pedestrian bridge at the center of campus, where two campus police officers gave chase, then shot and killed him. According to Price, Mohammad \\"looked scared\\" during the attack, but in addition to seeing fear \\"in his eyes,\\" Price said, \\"He also looked like he was having fun... He was smiling.\\" An investigation found that the police had acted properly in shooting the attacker when he refused to drop his weapon and, instead, lunged at one of them. Victims The stabbing victims included two students; one staff member; and Byron Price, an employee of a construction company who was at work on a building renovation when the stabbing began. All four victims suffered from non-life-threatening injuries, and are expected to recover. Perpetrator The attacker was identified as Faisal Mohammad, 18, a first- year student from Santa Clara. He graduated from Wilcox High School in 2015. The attacker's name had not been released on the day of the attack to give authorities time to contact the next of kin. Mohammad was born in the United States. Authorities have found no indication that he suffered from mental illness. High school friends described him as a \\"pleasant, quiet boy\\" who enjoyed going to a mosque. The backpack Mohammad was carrying contained \\"zip- tie handcuffs, two clear bags containing petroleum jelly, a night-vision scope, a safety hammer, two rolls of duct tape.\\" The sheriff described the hammer as a \\"device used to break windows\\". Investigation The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) was brought into the investigation. On March 17, 2016, the FBI concluded that Mohammad was inspired by ISIS and that the attack was an instance of lone-wolf terrorism. ISIS propaganda was found on Mohammad's computer, and he was also found to have visited extremist websites in the days preceding the attack. Mohammad left a manifesto in his pocket, detailing his plans. His original plan had been to use the tape to bind the other students to their desks and report the situation to police, steal a gun from a responding police officer, and use it to murder students who had refused to include him in their study group. He had also planned to cut someone's head off. He intended to spread the petroleum jelly on the floor to make responding police slip and fall while he stole their guns. Merced County Sheriff Vern Warnke initially said that although the manifesto made several references to Allah, the attack had nothing to do with religion or terrorism, and Mohammad was motivated by anger over being excluded from the study group. Sheriff Warnke later amended his comments to state that new information had come to light on November 7, which had led to the Merced County Sheriff's Department handing formal control over the investigation to UC Merced and the FBI. A law enforcement official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to the Merced Sun-Star newspaper, stated that the style of clothing worn by the attacker, along with websites he had visited and a printout of an Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS) flag found among his possessions, all contributed to the decision to hand control of the investigation to federal authorities. The FBI categorically denies it was aware of any \\"derogatory information\\" about Mohammad or that he had been the subject of any federal investigation prior to the stabbing. On December 11, Mohammad's roommate described him to federal investigators as \\"a loner and an extreme Muslim\\", also stating that he was not surprised by the incident. The roommate also recalled an incident when a friend had asked Mohammad what would happen if he touched the mat Mohammad used for praying and Mohammad had replied, \\"I will kill you.\\" References 2015 crimes in California Attacks in the United States in 2015 Attacks on universities and colleges in the United States Deaths by firearm in California Islamic terrorism in California Knife attacks Mass stabbings in the United States November 2015 crimes November 2015 events in the United States Stabbing attacks in 2015 Terrorist incidents in the United States in 2015 Terrorist incidents involving knife attacks Merced ","title":"University of California, Merced stabbing attack"},{"id":"48462118","text":"Single steel drilling caisson is a drill barge that was built for year- round oil exploration in shallow ice-covered waters in the Beaufort Sea. The unit, initially named SSDC and later shortened to SDC, was converted from an old oil tanker (Ujigawa Maru, later World Saga) in the early 1980s. It has been used to drill a total of eight oil wells on both Canadian and U.S. continental shelves, the most recent in 2006.  Description  The hull of the single steel drilling caisson, which consists of the forward two thirds of the hull of a very large crude carrier, is long and wide, and measures from keel to main deck. The original 80,000-tonne drilling unit sits on top of a 35,000-tonne submersible barge that acts as an artificial steel berm when the unit is lowered to the seafloor using water ballast. While on location, a box- type skirt prevents it from sliding sideways and an air injection system helps to overcome the suction effect during de-ballasting. The unit has six Caterpillar D399 diesel generators rated at 1,000hp each for onboard power generation, but since it has no propulsion of its own, it has to be towed to location. On the topside, the single steel drilling caisson has a standard 20,000 square feet land rig. The drilling mast and substructure have a rated capacity of 1,300,000lbs and can be skidded to drill a well to the maximum depth of through any of the four moon pools. Internally, the drilling unit can hold enough supplies to drill three to five wells depending on the well depth. In addition to drilling equipment, the topside includes two cranes, a helicopter platform, and accommodation for 90 workers.Arctic thaw. New Technology Magazine, December 2005.  History = 1971‚Äì1982  Ujigawa Maru, the oil tanker that would one day be converted into an Arctic drilling unit, was built by Kawasaki Heavy Industries in Sakaide, Japan. The ship was laid down on 21 July 1971, launched on 24 January 1972 and completed on 20 April 1972. At 232,134 tons deadweight, the single-hulled Ujigawa Maru was classified as a very large crude carrier (VLCC) with an overall length of and a beam of . The ship was propelled by a single fixed pitch propeller driven by a double-reduction steam turbine, giving it a service speed of . In 1977, Ujigawa Maru was acquired by Fawley Tankers Ltd (today part of BW Group) and renamed World Saga.  1982‚Äì2006  In the early 1980s, Canadian Marine Drilling (Canmar), the drilling subsidiary of Dome Petroleum, purchased World Saga with the intention of converting the oil tanker to an ice-resistant mobile offshore drilling unit that could continue exploratory drilling operations in the Beaufort Sea beyond the short open-water season. Previously, the company had utilized drillships that had been winterized for arctic conditions, but existing mooring and dynamic positioning systems could not keep the vessel in place in moving first-year ice. This limited station- keeping ability shortened the drilling season in the Beaufort Sea to about 100 days which was not sufficient to drill and test a typical well within one summer season. An alternative approach was to use artificial islands, either dredged islands with gradually sloping sides or sand-filled concrete structures resting on a subsea gravel berm. While caisson-retained islands were considered to be the most appropriate and cost-effective way to extend the drilling season in the Beaufort Sea, relocating them was time-consuming and expensive as the structure had to be completely reconstructed every time it was moved to a new drilling location. The new drilling unit was intended to overcome these limitations.Hippman, A. and Kelly, W. (1985): The Single Steel Drilling Caisson: A New Arctic Drilling Unit. Journal of Petroleum Technology, Volume 37, Issue 12. Society of Petroleum Engineers. World Saga was taken to Hitachi Zosen shipyard in Sakai, Japan, where all but the forward two-thirds of the tanker's hull were scrapped.Proposed Diapir Field Lease Offering, June 1984: Final Environmental Impact Statement, Volume 1. U.S. Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service, Alaska OCS Region. March 1984. Page IV-25. The remaining section was reinforced with 7,000 tonnes of additional steel and strengthened against ice with 13,000 tonnes of concrete that formed a thick inner hull. A new 4,000-ton topside with drilling derrick, cranes, helipad and accommodation block was installed on top of the ice-strengthened hull.Fitzpatrick, J. (1983): The Single Steel Drilling Caisson: A Novel Approach to Bottom-Founded Structures in Arctic Waters. SPE Annual Technical Conference and Exhibition, 5-8 October, San Francisco, California. Society of Petroleum Engineers, 1983. The drilling unit was given the name SSDC, short for single steel drilling caisson. After the conversion was complete, SSDC was towed to the Bering Sea. In October 1982, the drilling unit arrived to Dome Petroleum's Uviluk P-66 site and was lowered onto a man-made submerged berm in of water. The drilling began on 10 November and was completed on 21 May 1983.Callow, L. (2012): Oil and Gas Exploration & Development Activity Forecast, Canadian Beaufort Sea 2012 ‚Äì 2027. LTLC Consulting in association with Salmo Consulting Inc. April 2012. By January 1983, a grounded ice rubble pile had formed around the SSDC, protecting it from direct ice contact.Timco, G.W. and Johnston, M.E.

During the winter of 1983‚Äì1984, SSDC was used to drill an exploratory well at the Kogyuk N-67 site for Gulf Canada Resources Ltd. in of water. On 25 September 1983, before the drilling had begun, the unit was impacted by a multi-year ice floe with an estimated diameter of and thickness of . While the impact was clearly felt on the rig, no structural damage or movement relative to the seafloor was detected. The drilling of the well began on 28 October 1983 and was completed on 30 January 1984. On 25 June 1984, during the ice break-up, SSDC was impacted again by a large second-year ice floe, estimated to be in size and in thickness. During the winter, a grounded rubble field had again formed around the unit, shielding it from the colliding ice floe. After the first two seasons, it was found out that constructing a perfectly flat underwater gravel berm at every drilling location was very time-consuming. In August 1986, before being deployed in the American part of the Beaufort Sea, SSDC was mated with a submersible barge named MAT built by Hitachi Zosen. A layer of high density polyurethane foam between the two units ensured an even contact. The use of artificial steel berm removed the need to prepare the seafloor for drilling operations and made the unit capable of operating year-round in water depths between and in a wide variety of soil conditions. SSDC and MAT have not been separated since. In September 1986, SSDC was deployed at the Phoenix site in Harrison Bay, Alaska. The water depth was and the top of the MAT was below surface. Drilling of the well for Tenneco Oil Exploration Company began on 23 September and ended on 19 December 1986. In the following year, the rig was moved to the Aurora site, where it drilled another well for Tenneco in of water between 2 November 1987 and 30 August 1988.Beaufort Sea Exploration Wells. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management. Afterwards, SSDC was towed back to Canadian waters and stored in the sheltered waters of Thetis Bay near Herschel Island for two winters.Rig set for Herschel Island. Northern News Services. In 1990, SSDC returned to the Alaska and began drilling a well for ARCO Alaska at the Fireweed site in of water on 19 October 1990. The well was finished on 25 December 1990 and already on 11 January 1991 a second well for ARCO Alaska was spud at the Cabot site in of water. After the well was completed on 26 February 1992, SSDC was placed in long-term storage (\\"cold stacked\\") at Port Clarence, Alaska, where it would not be trapped in Beaufort Sea ice if work could be found elsewhere.SDC drill ship returns to Beaufort Sea. Petroleum News, December 2001, page 5. The Cabot well was also the last one drilled by SSDC under Canadian ownership. In 1997, Amoco sold Canmar's former fleet of drilling units and offshore icebreakers to an international consortium of shipping companies.Barker, A. and Timco, G.

She took part in three campaigns before captured her. She then served the Royal Navy until broken up in 1804. French service Bordelais departed Bordeaux in December 1798 under Jean-Fran√ßois Thibaut, returning in February 1799. Her command then passed to Jean-Baptiste Darrigrand, who cruised from February to through June. At the beginning of June Bordelais left Pasajes in company with Grand D√©cid√© and . They planned to intercept a convoy from Brazil, send their prizes to Pasajes, and then return there. It is not clear that they were at all successful, and in any case captured Courageaux on 26 June. Thibaut resumed command from July to August. In August, Jacques Moreau took command of Bordelais. Her armament was upgraded she departed for a cruise. Capture On 11 October 1799 R√©volutionnaire was off the Irish coast when she sighted a strange sail. R√©volutionnaire chased her quarry in a heavy gale for nine and a half hours over a distance of 114 miles (i.e., a rate of 12 miles per hour). When captured, the quarry turned out to be Bordelais, of Bordeaux. She was pierced for 26 guns but carried sixteen 12-pounder guns and eight 36-pounder carronades. She had a crew of 202 men. She had been cruising from Passage for 19 days during which time she had captured two vessels, an American ship carrying a cargo of tobacco, and a Portuguese ship sailing from Cork with provisions. Twysden, in an attempt to interest the Admiralty in purchasing her, described Bordelais as \\"a most beautiful new Ship, well calculated for His Majesty's Service; was the largest, and esteemed the fastest sailing Privateer out of France.\\" Bordelais arrived at Plymouth on 24 November. Four hundred French prisoners from and Bourdelaise landed at Plymouth on the same day.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 2, p.542. The Admiralty took Bordelais into service as the sixth-rate post ship Bordelais. HMS Bordelais Bordelais stayed at Plymouth until April 1800, undergoing fitting out. Captain Thomas Manby commissioned her in January 1800. On 15 July, Bordelais captured the French vessel Phoenix. , , and shared with Bordelais by agreement, as did . At some point, on a trip to Ireland the Bordelais foundered on a sandbank; Manby managed to refloat her by throwing everything possible overboard and she limped back to Plymouth. Bordelais spent a short period spent blockading the port of Flushing. She proved unsuited to the task, being long, narrow, and low in the water, and consequently so wet her crew sickened. She therefore was ordered back to Spithead. In December Manby sailed Bordelais for the Jamaica Station, in company with Andromache as escorts to a large convoy. A gale dispersed the convoy near Cape Finisterre and Bordelais was sent to the west of Barbados to look for stragglers. On her way she recaptured two of the stragglers ( and ) that had already fallen prey to French privateers. The French privateer Mouche had captured Aurora, Redman, master, as she was near the Western Islands. Mouche also captured Adventure, Finlay, master.LL 24 March 1801, ‚Ññ4136. Bordelaise encountered Adventure, which only struck on 8 January 1801 after a long chase. From her Mandby found out that Mouche had captured Aurora too, and had sent her to Teneriffe. He sailed there and intercepted Aurora on 10 January as she arrived. On 28 January 1801 Bordelais encountered three French vessels, two large brigs and a schooner, off Barbados. The three were to windward and started to chase Bordelais. Mandy shortened sail to give the enemy a better chance to catch up, which they did around sunset. Mandby then turned Bordelais and engaged the larger of the brigs at a range of ten yards. The other two French vessels held off when they realized could fire her carronades on both broadsides. After about 30 minutes the larger brig struck Robert Barrie, First Lieutenant of Bordelais, took possession of the brig, which turned out to be the 18-gun gun brig Curieuse. Curieuse was pierced for 20 guns and carried eighteen long 9-pounders. She had a crew of 168 men under the command of Captain G. Radelet. Victor \\"Hughes\\", governor of Cayenne, had dispatched the three vessels some 28 days earlier to intercept the outward-bound West Indies merchant fleet. In the engagement Bordelais had one man killed and seven wounded, generally lightly. Curieuse had some 50 men killed and wounded. Radelet survived for a few hours but eventually died from having lost both legs. About an hour after the British took possession, Bordelais started to sink. Manby ordered everyone off her, but 21 British sailors delayed because they were extricating the French wounded. Most of the rescuers were themselves rescued, but seven drowned. Dealing with the situation, securing 120 French prisoners, and repairing sails and rigging delayed Bordelais until 8p.m. She then set off after the two French vessels that had fled but was unable to find them in the night. In intercepting the three French vessels Manby helped protect the convoy from further predation. Reportedly, the French brig that escaped was Mutine, of sixteen 6-pounder guns and 156 men under the command of J. Reybaud, and the schooner Esp√©rance, of six 4-pounder guns and 52 men under the command of Captain Haywood.James (1837), Vol. 3, pp.136-7. From Barbados Bordelais made her way to Jamaica via Martinique. She then cruised the Mona Passage, where apparently she did great damage to the local trade. In one case a cutting out expedition at Aguadilla Bay by boats from Bordelais and another British vessel cut out a vessel that Manby turned into a tender; this vessel was lost with all hands shortly thereafter.A key function of a tender was resupply, that is, shuttling back-and-forth between her vessel's base and the vessel herself with fresh food, water, etc. However, frequently tenders cruised independently. In a second attack at Aguadilla an attempt to cut out a schooner there ended in failure, but no casualties. The cannon fire from the Spanish defences did so much damage to Bordelais that she had to return to Port Royal for repairs. Next, Bordelais cut out a small sloop with a cargo of wood from a small harbour on the coast of Puerto Rico. Manby cleared her and fitted her out as a tender. He put his second lieutenant James Gordon in command and gave him a crew of seven men and two boys. Shortly thereafter, a French privateer of one gun and 60 men captured Gordon and his sloop. The privateer took her prize into a small port near Aux Cayes. There they found another sloop, with a cargo of salt, that Bordelais captured the night before, and that the French had already recaptured, together with her prize crew of a midshipman and four men. The port was under the control of the Haitian government of Toussaint Louverture, which threw the crew of the privateer into prison. The men from Bordelais spent four months in prison but were well treated, with Gordon and the midshipman being permitted to move freely on parole. Eventually all were released to a cartel under the command of Captain Kelpoisson, the commander of the port of Aux Cayes, and the only Frenchman in a position of authority. The British arrived at Port Royal (except for one man who had died), where they found out that the war was over. They returned to Bordelais, where Gordon was able to sit down in the officers' mess before any of his fellow officers even knew that he had returned. On 23 October Barrie replaced Manby. This was a temporary appointment as Barrie was still a lieutenant. Bourdelais arrived in Portsmouth on 18 January 1802 at the same time as Barrie's promotion to commander was announced.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 7, p.91. Then on 29 April 1802 Captain John Hayes replaced Barrie. One source has Commander Barrie as captain of Bourdelais in July 1802,Naval Chronicle, Vol. 40. Appendix. but this seems to be in error.

Alcohol in Indonesia refers to the alcohol industry, alcohol consumption and laws related to alcohol in the South East Asian country of Indonesia. Indonesia is a Muslim majority country, yet it is also a pluralist, democratic and secular nation. These social and demographic conditions led to Islamic parties and pressure groups pushing the government to restrict alcohol consumption and trade, while the government carefully considers the rights of non-Muslims and consenting adults to consume alcohol, and estimates the possible alcohol ban effects on Indonesian tourism and the economy. Currently, there are no alcohol bans being enforced in Indonesia, with the exception of Aceh. Since 2014, anyone found consuming alcohol or breaching the codes on moral conduct, whether residents or visitors to Aceh, could face between six and nine cane lashes. In other parts of Indonesia, to appease the Islamic parties and pressure groups, the government agreed to apply mild restriction measures on alcohol, which includes high taxation and limited bans. Indonesia is among the countries that apply high taxes on imported alcoholic beverages; in 2015, import tax on alcohol jumped to 150%. Also in 2015, the Indonesian government banned the sale of alcohol from minimarkets and small shops, with the exception of Bali province, though sale was allowed in supermarkets, restaurants, bars, clubs and hotels. Nevertheless, in more cosmopolitan Indonesian cities like Jakarta, Medan and Surabaya, and also in tourism hotspots such as Bali, Yogyakarta and Batam, alcohol beverages are readily available, yet with higher prices, owing to the high tax applied upon alcoholic beverages. In February 2016, Indonesian Malt Beverage Producers Association (GIMMI) called the House of Representatives to draft for comprehensive regulations on the chain of production and the marketing of alcoholic beverages, instead of total prohibition. History and traditions Arak Bali as souvenir. Since ancient times, local alcoholic beverages were developed by natives in the archipelago. Some panels in 9th century Borobudur bas-reliefs depicted drink vendors, warung (small restaurant), and there is a panel depicting a building with people drinking (possibly alcoholic beverages), dancing and having fun, seeming to depict a tavern or lodging house. According to a Chinese source, Yingya Shenglan (c. 15th century) the people of Java in Majapahit kingdom drank wine made from palm sap called tuak (palm wine). However, by the 16th century Islam began to supplant Hinduism and Buddhism as the major religion in Indonesia. Since then, as a Muslim-majority country, Indonesian Muslims share Islamic dietary laws that prohibit alcoholic beverages. Nevertheless, the local alcohol-drinking culture still survives, at least among less-religious members of society and among the non-Muslim community. Certain ethno-cultural regions which are predominantly Christian are known for their affinity to alcohol-drinking traditions; such as the Batak, Torajan, Minahasan and Ambonese. Indonesia has its own traditional alcoholic beverages prepared by fermenting rice grain, gluten, sugar palm sap, and coconuts. According to culinary expert William Wongso, the culture of drinking distilled alcohol was never strong in Indonesia, with only a few regions having developed it. Ballo traditional alcohol beverage from Toraja, South Sulawesi. In the Batak community in North Sumatra, tuak (palm liquor) is a compulsory drink in the celebrations and became a tradition in the community. Batak tribes are predominantly of Christian Protestant faith, yet some of its clans are Muslim. A traditional Batak bar serving tuak is called a lapo tuak. In the Toraja lands of South Sulawesi, their version of tuak ‚Äî made from fermented sugar palm sap, is called ballo. In Torajan traditional ceremonies, rituals and celebrations, ballo is always served, either as a prerequisite for the ritual; as an offering for ancestral spirits, as well as for drinks for guests. Ballo is also commonly consumed by the neighboring Bugis ethnic group. In the Minahasa region of North Sulawesi, an almost identical palm liquor, also made from sugar palm sap, is called saguer. In Nusa Tenggara and Maluku Islands the people also drink palm wine, locally known as sopi. Also in the Minahasa region, the people drink a highly alcoholic drink called cap tikus (lit. \\"rodent brand\\"). Cap tikus is made from distilled saguer or sopi (palm wine), which increases its alcohol content. The origin of cap tikus brand is unclear. It is suggested that circa 1820s, prior to the 1830 Java War, the KNIL Minahasan legion found and bought distilled saguer or sopi sold in blue bottles embossed with the image of mouse sold by a Chinese merchant in Fort Amsterdam in Manado. Today however, because of poor regulation on alcohol production in this region, this traditional home-made cap tikus industry is considered as an illegal beverage, due to the high prevalence of mortal alcohol poisoning. Eagle brand Balinese brem (5% alcohol). Bottled brem bali (Balinese rice wine) and arrack are popular beverages in the Hindu-majority island of Bali. Brem is a brownish colored liquor with 5% alcohol. It is also exported to Japan and China. For Balinese people it has a religious significance too. Brem, arak and tuak are required for tabuhan (offerings) to the gods. In Solo, Central Java, ciu, a local adaptation of Chinese wine, made from cider molasses of sugarcane is well known. It is linked to Solo's history as a sugar plantation and production center in colonial times. The Dutch Colonial state was established in Indonesia in the 1800s. The colonial Dutch brought their European drinking culture to the East Indies, most prominently with beer. The Heineken beer company established its brewery factory in Surabaya in 1929 during the Dutch colonial rule of Indonesia. By the 1960s, Indonesians developed their own local brands of beer, which included Bintang Beer (nationalized from Heineken) and Anker Beer. In April 2019, East Nusa Tenggara Provincial Government supports the legal aspect of production and distribution of sopi, a local traditional alcoholic beverage. This policy is very likely to make sopi the first fully supported alcoholic product by the local government in Indonesia. Regulation A Presidential regulation signed by Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono in 2013 gave legal cover to distribution of alcohol, it classified alcoholic beverages in Indonesia in three categories. Drinks having an alcohol percentage less than 5% (A class), 5%‚Äì20% (B class) and more than 20% (C class). It was replacement of the 1997 decree after the Supreme Court abolished it following appeals from hard-line religious groups like the Islamic Defenders Front. The 2012 court ruling came after a draft bill proposed by the United Development Party (PPP) to completely ban the sale, production and consumption of alcohol in Indonesia. However, the 2013 presidential regulation was welcomed by travel agencies in the wake of the harmful effects of the proposed draft on tourism. Prices of wine and spirits in Indonesia increased by 140.5% and 154.4% respectively between 2009 and 2014. In 2015 the government further hiked the import tariff on wine and spirits which nearly doubled the price of alcoholic beverages. Industry and products A beer assortment in Bali; Carlsberg, Bali Hai, Bintang and Anker. Some foreign companies which sell alcohol in Indonesia are Diageo, Pernod Ricard, Remy Cointreau and Bacardi. PT Multi Bintang is the largest domestic brewery of Indonesia. As per market experts, because of various regulations, alcohol sales are declining in Indonesia. Bintang Beer of Multi Bintang brewery is the largest selling beer of Indonesia. Multi Bintang is a subsidiary of Heineken Asia Pacific. In 2011, Bintang Beer won the Gold Medal for the Lager Beer Category and was awarded 'Champion Beer 2011' at the world's class beer competition, the Brewing Industry International Award (BIIA 2011) in London. In 2014 Bintang Radler was introduced which was the first flavored beer produced domestically in Indonesia. Other major beer producers are Delta Djakarta known for its Anker Beer, and PT Bali Hai Brewery Indonesia known for its Bali Hai, an affiliate to an Asian brewery, which also produced under license other brands including San Miguel Beer, Asahi beer and Lowenbrau beer (non-alcoholic). In 2012, 'Drum Green Label' whisky of Astidama Distillery won Gold Medal in the Spirit International Prestige (SIP) Awards held in the USA. It became the first whisky from Indonesia to get international recognition. Illegal alcohol The high prices of alcohol beverages in Indonesia, caused by high taxation and restriction, has led to cases of illegal alcohol in the country. As the legal and imported alcoholic beverages become unaffordable, locals turn to illegal bootlegged alcohol for a cheaper drink. These illegal alcoholic drinks are known in Indonesian as alkohol oplosan (lit. \\"solved alcohol\\") and account for over 80% of the alcohol consumed in Indonesia. These illicitly produced liquors which are traditionally home-made, are considered illegal by Indonesian law, due to the high incidence of deadly alcohol poisoning. The lapen liquor from Yogyakarta for example, is made from industrial alcohol of 85% volume mixed with water with a 1:4 or 5 alcohol to water ratio; then mixed with fruit essence as a flavoring agent. In February 2010, 16 people died and 5 lapen sellers were arrested in Yogyakarta, due to alcohol poisoning and illicit alcohol production. In September 2010, three Russian Sukhoi fighter technicians died in Makassar from methanol poisoning in their drinks. Yogyakarta residents were again affected by badly made alcohol in 2016.https://www.bbc.com/news/world- asia-35519438 Other traditionally made alcoholic spirits such as Solo's ciu, Manado's cap tikus, and some Balinese arrack are known as illegal alcohol, also due to the high incidence of alcohol poisoning.

Swanson was the first African American to attend the University of Virginia. He graduated from Howard University in 1945 with a Bachelor's degree in political science and then from the Howard University School of Law in 1948 with an LL.B. (now Juris Doctor). After law school, Swanson clerked for the Richmond, Virginia law firm Hill, Martin, & Robinson and then for attorney Jerry L. Williams in Danville, Virginia. In 1949, Swanson applied to the LL.M. program at the University of Virginia School of Law to pursue graduate work. He had recently opened his own law firm in Martinsville, Virginia, and wrote to the UVA Law Committee on Admissions that his \\"primary reason\\" for applying to the law school's LL.M. program was his \\"desire to teach.\\" On January 12, 1950, the UVA law faculty voted to admit Swanson to the law school, and they sent the matter to UVA President Colgate Darden for a final decision.UVA Law Faculty Meeting Minutes, Papers of the Dean, UVA Law Library Special Collections The University's Board of Visitors rejected Swanson's application on July 14, 1950 with the claim that his admission would violate Virginia state laws and the state constitution. Swanson filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Virginia to gain admission to the law school for the fall 1950 term. The firm of Hill, Martin, & Robinson and the Virginia chapter of the NAACP, including Thurgood Marshall, served as Swanson's legal counsel. Chief Justice John J. Parker of the Fourth United States Circuit Court of Appeals, Federal District Judge John Paul, and Circuit Appeals Judge Morris A. Soper presided over the ensuing case, Swanson v. Rector & Visitors of Univ. of Va. On September 5, 1950, the court ruled in favor of Swanson's admission to the UVA School of Law on the grounds that he was a qualified applicant and that UVA was the only institution in the state at which Swanson could pursue a graduate degree in law.Judgment at 3, Swanson v. Rector & Visitors of Univ. of Va., No. 30 (W.D. Va. Sept. 5, 1950). Swanson registered for classes as a graduate student in the law school on September 15, 1950. This case laid the foundation for desegregation at the University of Virginia. During his UVA Law residency, Swanson took law classes and worked closely with his advisers on the law faculty to develop a topic for his LL.M. thesis. He lived in a segregated Charlottesville, and while most law students lived close to the UVA Grounds, Swanson lived more than a mile away at the Carver Inn in the black neighborhood of Vinegar Hill. Despite facing a climate of racial prejudice at UVA, Swanson took initiative to be an active participant in University life beyond his graduate work. He attended football games and was a season ticket holder to the University's Tuesday Evening Concert Group. Swanson was a member of the University's integrated YMCA and helped organize that group's Committee for Racial Understanding. Further, under the terms of the Supreme Court's McLaurin decision, Swanson's victory in enrolling at UVA forced all UVA- sponsored events to be non-segregated, such as Ralph Bunche's prominent talk to the UVA Law Student Legal Forum in 1951. In 1951, Swanson completed the one-year of residency that his graduate program required and returned to practicing law in Martinsville. He worked on his thesis into 1952, all while working as an attorney, but he did not submit a final paper within the two- year deadline and did not receive his LL.M. degree. In 1957, Swanson opened a law firm in Alexandria, Virginia, and in 1961, he took a position with the IRS. Swanson retired from the IRS in 1984. He died in 1992. In 2016, Swanson's historic court victory was commemorated with the installation of a plaque at the former courthouse, now the current downtown location of the Jefferson- Madison Regional Library.

She disappeared mysteriously in the Caribbean in early 1812, and became the subject of a ghost ship legend. Privateer In 1807, shipowner Tiesset commissioned Duc de Dantzig under Captain Jean-Pierre Antoine Duchenne, with 14 guns and 50 men.

Duc de Dantzig took possession of William & Henry the next day.LL n¬∞4288. Duchenne had to sue, successfully, for his share in the capture of William & Henry. Baclin eventually received a share of 220,250.21 francs. That there seem to be no reports of captures after the first until 1811 suggests that prior to October 1810 she may have simply sailed as a letter of marque rather than as a private man-of-war. In October 1810, Fran√ßois Aregnaudeau assumed command of Duc de Dantzig. On 20 November he captured Ceres, on 4 December the British , and a few days later the American Cantone and the British Jane in the Gulf of Mexico. Lloyd's List reported that the capture of Bonetta, Cock, master, took place off Sombrero, Anguilla as Bonetta was sailing from Guadeloupe to Charleston. It further reported that Duke of Dantzick was armed with fourteen 18-pounder carronades and had a crew of 100 men. Duke had recently captured Industry, Moore, master, which was sailing from St Kitts to Wilmington, and the Spanish three-masted schooner General Romana carrying dry goods from Cadiz to Vera Cruz. Duke of Dantzick destroyed both.LL 29 January 1811, ‚Ññ4532. However, Bonetta arrived at Cadiz on 30 January 1811, and not in French possession. Aregnaudeau had put a prize crew of ten of his men, plus two Spaniards and two Portuguese on Bonetta. On 22 December the Spaniards and Portuguese attacked the Frenchmen, killed three, and took possession of the ship.LL 1 March 1811, ‚Ññ4541.

Jane had been sailing from Savannah to Liverpool when she was captured.LL n¬∞ 4548. Damaged by a heavy sea, Duc de Dantzig had to throw her guns overboard to remain afloat and returned to harbour. She set sail again on 18 June 1811. On 22 July 1811 Duc de Dantzig captured the merchantman while Lady Penrhyn was sailing from London to Grenada. Duc de Dantzig set Lady Penrhyn on fire, scuttling her. LL reported that the privateer Duc de Dantzig, of 14 guns (18-pounder carronades) and 128 men, of Nantes, had captured Thames, J. Clark, master, on 17 July, and Lady Penrhyn, Burgess, master on 22 July. Thames had been sailing from London to St Vincent's, and Lady Penrhyn from London to Grenada. Both vessels were in ballast, and Duc de Danzig burnt them after taking off the people on board them. She then captured the schooner Ann, which had set out from Barbados to Demerara. Duc de Dantzig put her prisoners aboard Ann and let her proceed; Ann arrived at Barbados on 26 July.LL n¬∞ 4594. , Barry, master, arrived at Jamaica on 23 July. On 29 June, as she was sailing from Cork she had encountered the privateer Duc de Danzig off Ushant.

Duc de Dantzig had captured a Spanish ship and an English packet three days earlier.LL, n¬∞ 4600. On 28 August, Duc de Dantzig arrived in New York with a British prize that the US government seized. By October 1811, Aregnaudeau had captured Planter, from London, Tottenham, and a Spanish schooner. On 1 September Duc de Dantzig captured Tobago, Paterson, master, off St Bartholomew's. Tobago was sailing from Guadeloupe and St Bartholemew's to New Brunswick when Duc de Dantzig captured and burnt her.LL, 6 December 1811, n¬∞ 4621.

Aregnaudeau and Duc de Dantzig were last heard of on 13 December 1811, when the privateer Gazelle reached Morlaix and reported on her activities. Fate After the last mention of her, Duc de Dantzig disappeared without a trace. She might have been cruising in the Atlantic or in the Caribbean at the time, and either been sunk in a night encounter against a British frigate, or in a tropical cyclone. Napol√©on Gallois later relayed the legend that an unspecified French frigate had encountered the wreck of Duc de Dantzig drifting at sea, covered with dried blood and the putrefying corpses of her crew, many crucified to the masts or the deck. There were no signs that she had been in a recent battle: no new shot holes, and her sails and rigging were intact. Some blood-stained papers found in the captain's cabin identified her captain as Fran√ßois Aregnaudeau. The crew of the frigate set the brig ablaze.

The Boulogne camp may designate two military camps around Boulogne-sur-Mer in France.  First camp  The first camp was prepared by Julius Caesar, in 54 BCto prepare the fleet for his second expedition to Britain. One hypothesis is that Julius Caesar set up his camp at the current location of the old City of Boulogne-sur-Mer. Some historians believe that the Old City was built on the camp; at a vicinity to Itius port which he cites in Chapter IV of its Gallic Wars : : Caesar returns in Hither Gaul, and from there to the army. When he got there, he visited all neighborhoods, and finds that the singular activity of the soldiers had managed, despite extreme shortages of all things, to build about six hundred ships of the form described above and twenty eight galleys, all ready for sea in a few days. After giving praise to soldiers and those who had led the work, he instructs his intentions and ordered them to go all the Itius port, where he knew the ride in Brittany is very convenient, the distance this island to the mainland being only thirty thousand steps.  Second camp  thumb Telegram of General Soult Napoleon informing him that the English squadron is still before Boulogne, June 12, 1804. Archives nationales. The second camp was established by Bonaparte (Napoleon 1st) in 1803, and continued by Napoleon until 1805. This was where he assembled the \\"Grand Army\\", or Army of the ocean, to invade Britain. On May 16, 1803, the British, without previous declaration of war, seized a hundred French and Batavian ships. France declared war on England then. Bonaparte then chose Boulogne-sur-Mer as a base for attacks against England. The Boulogne camp housed about 60,000 soldiers in 1805, it was divided into two large camps : * one was on the left bank of the Liana, near d'Outreau, * the other was in the area of Vallon Terlincthun and the plateau of the tour d'Order. At the top of the cliff were the command barracks, including that of Napoleon, but the headquarters was located at Castle of Pont-de-Briques. The Boulogne camp is behind the construction of the magazine. We can especially note the work done in 1841 in the context of strengthening the protection of places: Construction of a wall in stone, paving of the courtyard and a gatehouse and a lightning rod. Powder belonged to the artillery and was paid in 1835 by the Indirect Taxation Administration. The latter are sites of gunpowder and hunting weapons. When Second World War came, the powder bunker was certainly exploited by the Germans who reinforced the site, as evidenced by bunker there. At the end of the conflict, the magazine was abandoned to become a real ruin until the day when the city decided to restore it. The inauguration took place in 1990.

However, its power began to diminish during the 1970s, with some of the clubs chapters \\"patching over\\" to the Outlaws MC in 1977. The remaining chapters would eventually become members of the Hells Angels along with most of the other major outlaw clubs in Ontario. Early history The founding chapter of the first iteration of Satan's Choice was established during the late 1950s in Toronto, usually hanging around \\"Aida's\\", a downtown restaurant. This version of Satan's Choice was small in size, only numbering about 45 members, and had a very casual, non-criminal focus at the time. This club would disband in 1962, but went on to serve as the namesake for a group of four other motorcycle clubs which came together as the new Satan's Choice in 1965, namely the Phantom Riders, the Canadian Lancers, the Throttle Twisters, and the Wild Ones. In 1962, the Satan's Choice club led by Don Norris were forced to disband following attacks from the rival Black Diamond Riders club who humiliated them by beating up in street fights and stealing their patches. Bernie Guindon of the Phantom Riders decided to use the name and patch of the disbanded club because he knew it would enrage the Black Diamond Riders. Ever since a brawl in 1962 that saw the Black Diamond Riders defeat the Golden Hawk Riders that Guindon belonged to at the time, it has been his mission to seek vengeance on the Black Diamond Riders. Former Phantom Riders president Bernie Guindon would become the president of this newer, larger version of Satan's Choice, and would later become their national president as the group expanded. Guindon had promoted the merger of the four clubs to end the attacks of the Black Diamond Riders, arguing if the four clubs were united, it would have such an overwhelming numerical superiority that it would ensure that the Black Diamond Riders would not dare attack them anymore. Guindon received permission from Norris to use the name and patch of the former Satan's Choice. In the outlaw biker subculture, using the name and patch of a former club without permission is seen as very rude. The group regulated itself somewhat differently from most motorcycle clubs such as the Hells Angels, using a series of bylaws instead of a single written constitution or charter. Criminalization and expansion This new Satan's Choice started out much the same as the original, a group of young men simply wishing to escape from society and its rigid norms and expectations. Satan's Choice members were not serious criminals, if they committed any crimes at all. In 1965 a documentary, Satan's Choice about the newly founded club directed by Donald Shebib appeared, making the club famous in Toronto. Charismatic and handsome, Guindon was the \\"star\\" of the documentary. Prior to the 1960s, Toronto had a very staid image of \\"Toronto the Good\\", a city whose people were mostly hard- working, conservative God-fearing Protestants of British descent, a bastion of Victorian values that was prosperous, safe and well run, but also rather boring and conventional. In the 1960s, it was common for young people to Toronto to embrace a \\"hip\\" image, choosing ways of life that were quite contrary to the traditional Anglo-Protestant Victorian values that had previously defined Toronto, which were viewed by the young people as conformist, dull and stifling. The outlaw biker subculture came to be seen as a symbol of rebellion and freedom with many of the younger people having a very romantic and idealized image of the bikers, who were admired for their \\"authenticity\\". Bikers were viewed as dangerous men who were however \\"cool\\" and \\"hip\\" in their rejection of \\"Toronto the Good\\" values. One young woman interviewed in the documentary said she liked riding with Satan's Choice because they were \\"not phony\\" and were \\"real\\". The Ontario outlaw biker subculture was violent, but in the 1960s the violence was usually limited to brawls and it was most unusual for bikers to kill each other. The unwillingness of outlaw bikers to testify against one another in court following their code made it difficult for the authorities to prosecute them for their frequent street fights, which contributed to their \\"cool\\" image as men who successfully broke the law. Shebib said of Satan's Choice in 1965: \\"It was a lot of booze, broads, and bikes. It wasn't organized crime as it became. But I don't think you wanted to cross them\\". On 25 September 1965, Guindon held the first national convention of Satan's Choice at a farmhouse in Markham Township just outside of Toronto, which was also attended by the Vagabonds club. Amid much riotous drinking in a barn where the convention was being held, 23 police officers raided the barn about midnight, but came under a shower of empty beer bottles, forcing them to retreat. The police had not left behind any men to guard their cars which were parked outside of the barn, and as a result while the police were being showered with bottles, some of the bikers had trashed the parked police cruisers, ripped out the radios and punctured their tyres, forcing the policemen to walk back to the station. At about 4: 00 am, the enraged police returned with a greater force of 84 officers who engaged in a fierce brawl with the bikers. On their second attempt, the police had plastic shields that allowed them to advance on the barn despite the shower of empty beer bottles being thrown at them. The police arrested 55 bikers plus 9 women who also attending the party. The police smashed up the motorcycles of the bikers in retaliation for the damage done to their cruisers. Journalists who saw the scene the next morning described it as looking like a war zone. The incident at the barn in Markham attracted much media attention, as did the fact that the police seized at the barn a mixture of weapons such as sawed-off shotguns, handguns, axes and bike chains together with an immense quantity of alcohol and marijuana. Arrested together with Guindon at the barn were his second wife Barbara Ann and his right-hand man Howard Berry. On Sunday morning as those arrested were taken into the Don jail, there were a number of journalists from the local television stations present and the bikers blew kisses to the cameras. On Monday after the Saturday night raid, the arrested bikers were taken to a courthouse, which became the most popular \\"tourist attraction\\" in Toronto that day as one journalist from the The Globe and Mail newspaper described it with a large crowd waiting outside the courthouse, many of whom were high school students who were there to cheer on the bikers as they were marched into the courthouse to be fined. In the end, the judge fined Satan's Choice a thousand dollars, most of it in the form of $10 dollars fines for each individual for being present in a place where alcohol was being illegally served plus $3.50 fine for court costs. The Markham incident was not considered a triumph for the forces of law and order with public opinion on the side of the bikers, who were felt to be victims of excessive force. By the end of 1965, Guindon had emerged as something of a celebrity in Toronto while Satan's Choice had become the most best known and largest outlaw biker club in Canada. Towards the end of the 1960s and into the 1970s, the group slowly developed into an outlaw motorcycle club as a result of the large potential profits from criminal activities. While they were involved in a number of criminal activities that were typical for biker gangs, such as robbery, theft, assault, and running prostitution rings, they were notably deeply involved in drug production and trafficking. The club operated a number of drug labs out of remote cabins in Northern Ontario, with production focusing especially on PCP and methamphetamines, better known in the area as \\"Canadian Blue\\". This success emboldened elements of Satan's Choice, in particular their Toronto chapter, into sparking a gang war with two rival Toronto biker gangs, the Black Diamond Riders MC and the Vagabonds MC. However, the rest of the group's chapters met and ended the war, making peace with the two rival groups and disciplining the leaders of the Toronto chapter. During this time period the Satan's choice had grown rapidly, reaching their peak strength in 1977, with about 200 members across 13 chapters in Ontario and Quebec. Guindon recruited an university drop-out turned chef, Howard Doyle Berry, aka \\"Pigpen\\", of Peterborough into Satan's Choice, who became his principle lieutenant. To compensate for his solidly respectable middle-class background, the former Classics student Berry embraced a slovenly, disheveled look and purposely led a life of poor hygiene, hence the unflattering moniker \\"Pigpen\\". Berry liked to offend and disgust people via such antics such as vomiting over new members; attaching the remains of a dead skunk he found on the road to his Satan's Choice jacket; and bringing and eating his own feces when invited to dine with other Choice members. Through Guindon found Berry repulsive, his willingness to do anything made him useful and he came to serve as his principle enforcer. One former Satan's Choice member Cecil Kirby wrote in his 1986 memoirs Mafia Enforcer that Satan's Choice members specialized in seducing the female clerks who operated the Ontario Provincial Police's computers and were always willing to share information from the computers with their boyfriends. Kirby stated that there was one clerk who had access to the most classified information and: > \\"Club members carried her number in their wallets. If a member was worried > about the cops, all he had to do was call her number, and she'd access the > police computer to see if there were any warrants on him. When we spotted a > rival gang member, we'd also use her to see if there were any outstanding > fugitive warrants on him. If there were, we'd have someone in the club call > up the cops and tip them off where that rival was and who was with him. It > was a good way of avoiding trouble and getting rid of rival gang members. We > could also check out anybody's criminal record through that computer. This > helped us spot people trying to infiltrate us from rival gangs or the cops\\". Kirby concluded that Satan's Choice \\"had the upper hand in Toronto because we had the best intelligence network around. We were able to move on the other gangs faster than they could move on us because we had such good sources and good information on the habits of the other gangs\\". Alliance with the Outlaws MC In 1975, Satan's Choice began an alliance with the Outlaws MC, one of the largest international outlaw motorcycle clubs. The benefits of such a relationship worked to the advantage of both groups. Satan's Choice gained access to a larger support network of clubs throughout the United States and beyond, opening the club to new business opportunities and possibly even reinforcements in the event of another club war. Meanwhile, the Outlaws gained a strong presence in Ontario, precluding any expansion by the Hells Angels into the region. Furthermore, the Outlaws gained a way to challenge the supremacy of the Hells Angels in Quebec through access to the Montreal chapter of Satan's Choice. This led the Montreal chapter and their Outlaw allies into open conflict with the Hells Angels-backed Popeyes Motorcycle Club, resulting in a number of casualties on both sides. Kirby was present when \\"Pigpen\\" Berry opened fire on the clubhouse of the Popeyes Motorcycle Club with a sawed off Lee‚ÄìEnfield .303 rifle with a ten round clip, saying \\"It was like a cannon going off\\". Not long after this, in 1976, the club's leader Bernie Guindon would be incarcerated on drug charges, further diminishing the gang's power. This would soon lead to the fracturing of newly weakened Satan's Choice, when in July 1977, the Ottawa, St. Catharines, Windsor, and Montreal chapters fully abandoned Satan's Choice in favour of the much larger Outlaws. In 1977, Guindon was described in media reports as being furious with Garnet \\"Mother\\" McEwen, the man he appointed as interim national president for having engineered the \\"patch over\\". From within the Millhaven prison, Guindon placed a bounty on McEwen, promising to pay $10, 000 dollars as the reward for killing McEwen. Guindon spent hours punching his bed in fury as he wished his bed was McEwen. Satan's Choice lost the chapters in Montreal, Hamilton, St. Catherine's, Sault St. Marie, Windsor, London, Ottawa, Kingston and part of the Toronto chapter to the Outlaws. When Guindon was released early from prison for good behavior in 1984, all Satan's Choice had left were the chapters in Thunder Bay, Kitchener, Oshawa, and Toronto. The way his supposed allies, the Outlaws, poached several chapters away from him while he was in prison caused Guindon to have a lasting grunge against the Outlaws and during the subsequent struggle between the Hells Angels and the Outlaws, Guindon was to lean in a pro-Angel neutrality. The Port Hope 8 case The Golden Hawk Riders of Port Hope were a small club of 7 members, and were considering \\"patching over\\" to join the Outlaws. In the aftermath of the split of 1977, relations between the Outlaws and Satan's Choice were very unfriendly. Several members of Satan' Choice warned the Golden Hawk Riders, including their sergeant-at-arms, Bill \\"Heavy\\" Matiyek, who had a reputation as a hothead, not to go through with the planned \\"patch over\\", a demand that Matiyek rejected. Port Hope is a small town close to Oshawa and an Outlaw chapter in Port Hope would threaten the profits from the drug trade enjoyed by the Satan's Choice Oshawa chapter. Port Hope is less than a half a hour away by automobile from Oshawa. A confrontation took place between members of the Golden Hawk Riders and the Outlaws vs. members of Satan's Choice on 18 October 1978 in the bar- room of the Queen's Hotel in Port Hope. Matiyek who was drunk and high on marijuana and amphetamines was talking about shooting the Satan's Choice members in the Queen's Hotel bar-room, leading them to call for help, causing Lorne Campbell of the Choice's Toronto chapter to come to their aid. Campbell heard that Matiyek had a gun and brought along a gun. The confrontation in the bar-room ended with guns being drawn and Campbell shooting and killing Matiyek at about 10:55 pm. Campbell claims that Matiyek had reached for his gun first, leading him to open fire. Much of the police investigation was slapdash with the detectives taking no fingerprints from the crime scene while interviewing the witnesses as a group instead of individually. Subsequently, four Choice members were charged with Matiyek's murder, but not Campbell. Ultimately eight members of Satan's Choice were charged with the murder. During the trial, Campbell testified that he had killed Matiyek and the eight accused were innocent. Some of the evidence that emerged during the trial such as the fact that the same bullet that killed Matiyek was found lodged inside of the body of one of the accused, Steve \\"Nutty\\" Comeau, supported the defense. The defense lawyers argued that Comeau could not have possibly fired the same bullet went through Matiyek's head that also ended in his side, leading the prosecution to change its thesis midway through the trial to now claim that there had been two gunmen instead of one as first claimed. The conviction of the six of eight accused for Matiyek's murder despite Campbell's testimony on the witness stand that he had killed him was highly controversial in 1979 and remains so. The Port Hope case became the subject of a best-selling 1988 book Conspiracy of Brothers by the American journalist Mick Lowe and the 1990 protest song Justice in Ontario by the American singer Steve Earle. The lawyers for one of the Satan's Choice members convicted of Matiyek's murder, David \\"Tee Hee\\" Hoffmann, were able in 1981 to prove on the basis of police intercepts of Hoffmann's telephone calls that he was making phone calls in Kitchener on the night of 18 October 1978 and thus was not in Port Hope as the prosecution had claimed at the trial. The fact that the police had these intercepts all long was controversial and Lowe feels that Hoffmann should never had been charged with Matiyek's murder, let alone convicted. One of the Satan's Choice members convicted of Matiyek's murder, Richard Sauv√©, became a noted prisoners' rights activist who in 1993 won a decade long legal fight ending at the Supreme Court of Canada to give prisoners the right to vote. Increasing pressure on Satan's Choice In the decades following the alignment of Satan's Choice with the Outlaws, particularly the late 1980s and 1990s, the club would eventually find itself falling into a steady decline in both numbers and influence. One of the reasons for this was a renewed effort by law enforcement, particularly in Ontario, to prosecute the club for their criminal activities. An early example of this was a series of police raids in 1984 that seized two small-caliber handguns, marijuana & marijuana oil, and a small amount of cocaine from 4 private residences in Scarborough. On 19 November 1984, Guindon was released on parole for good behavior and despite his parole conditions, resumed his association with his club. Guindon went to Windsor to beat up Bill Hulko, the former president of the Choice chapter who had gone over to the Outlaws in 1977. Putting his boxing skills to good use, Guindon recalled: \\"I soaked him right in the fucking head...He did nothing...I just wanted to see where his balls were. He didn't have his balls that fucking day\\". Between 1985‚Äì1988, Guindon opened up four new chapters in Ontario, adding about 95 new members. By the 1980s, Satan's Choice had moved into selling cocaine and a pipeline was opened to move cocaine from Toronto to Alberta, where many oil workers used cocaine to ease the tedium of their jobs. Rival gangs would also begin to target the club, as evidenced by the bombing of the Satan's Choice clubhouse on Kintyre Avenue in Toronto on 1 August 1995. In 1995, Satan's Choice made an alliance with the Diablos, a club led by a former Choice member, Frank Lenti, resulting in a biker war in the summer of 1995 with the Loners, a club founded by Lenti who had been expelled from it the previous year. On 25 August 1995, Lenti was badly wounded by a bomb planted in his car, which marked the end of the biker war. The mayor of Toronto, Barbara Hall, unaware that the war was over, attempted to ban all outlaw bikers from Toronto. Her attempt to shut down the Satan's Choice clubhouse in Toronto proved impossible due to the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, leading her to try to have the city of Toronto buy the clubhouse in order to shut it down. The Choice set an absurdly high price for the clubhouse, which caused much controversy in Toronto when Hall indicated her willingness to pay it. The controversy is believed to have been a factor in Hall's defeat in her 1997 reelection bid. Making matters worse, the club was in just the next year targeted by a major police operation dubbed Project Dismantle, which involved almost 300 officers from the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP), as well as the municipal police forces of Halton, Durham, Hamilton-Wentworth, Waterloo, Sudbury, and Metropolitan Toronto. The result of the raids included the seizure of marijuana plants and hydroponic equipment valued at 11 million dollars, as well as more than $125 000 cash and over $265 000 worth of other drugs including Cocaine. The police forces also seized a variety of firearms, including 12 handguns, 5 non-restricted rifles, and 7 restricted weapons such as automatic pistols, sawed-off shotguns, and even machine guns such as a World War 2-era Bren gun and tripod. In Sudbury the operation specifically targeted the local chapter of Satan's Choice and members of the Hamilton chapter, which all but wiped these chapters out. This specific part of the operation involved a police surveillance operation that caught the members of the club discussing the bombing of a strip club who had disrespected several members of the club. Many of the members of these chapters found themselves in prison or otherwise leaving the club, with the Sudbury chapter being reduced to just 3 full members from the peak of 8 members and 2 \\"hangarounds\\". Unfortunately for those involved with Project Dismantle, no convictions were ever given as a result of the charges and arrests stemming from this operation. This was partly as a result of most of the wiretap evidence being excluded after Justice John McDonald of the Ontario Superior Court found that a senior OPP detective lied to five different Superior Court justices to get the wiretaps approved in addition to destroying other evidence. Ion Croitoru, a thuggish professional wrestler and the president of Satan's Choice Hamilton chapter responded to Project Dismantle by blowing up a police station in Sudbury on 15 December 1996. Len Isnor of the OPP's Anti-Biker Unit was not impressed with Croitoru, calling him \\"just stupid\\". However, Croitoru's career in professional wrestling made him a local celebrity in Hamilton and to a lesser extent elsewhere in Ontario. By contrast, Isnor described Michel Dub√©, the president of the Choice's Sudbury chapter, as one of the most dangerous outlaw bikers in Ontario, a man with a \\"crazed look\\" in his eyes that reminded many of Charles Manson. It was apparently Croitoru's intention to blow up the Solid Gold strip club because he and Dub√© had been refused admittance earlier that year, but Dub√© diverted the plan into blowing up the police station instead. According to those who knew him, Dub√©'s fondest wish was to attach a powerful bomb to a loaded fuel tanker and to drive it in a suicide attack into a police station in order to kill himself and as many policemen as possible. The bombing occurred at 2 am just after a Christmas party and only one police dispatcher was wounded by the blast. The bombing of the police station resulted in Isnor ordering a general crackdown on Satan's Choice, arresting all of them. Croitoru was convicted of trafficking in steroids and for having the bomb built while Dub√© who was facing charges of two counts of murder plus charges relating to the bombing hanged himself in jail. Alliance and merger with the Hells Angels The arrangement with the Outlaws also resulted in Satan's Choice becoming a target of the Hells Angels, who happened to be the Outlaws' main rivals. The Hells Angels had for decades been prevented from expanding from Quebec into Ontario by the Outlaws. The split of 1977 caused Satan's Choice to favor the Angels against the Outlaws. However, Guindon whose Canadian nationalism was described as \\"almost a mania\\" repeatedly turned down offers all through the 1990s made by Hells Angels' national president Walter Stadnick to have Satan's Choice \\"patch over\\" to the Hells Angels. Guindon who besides for being an outlaw biker had also been a professional boxer and by the late 1990s he was beginning to suffer from brain damage caused by his boxing career. Increasing Andre Wattel, the president of the Choice's Kitchener chapter began to exercise leadership and Wattel unlike Guindon was much more open to joining the Hells Angels. Satan's Choice, under their new club president Andre Wattel, decided to join the Hells Angels and abandon their own club's identity and autonomy because it would mutually benefit their criminal enterprises. Satan's Choice, along with most of the other major Ontario biker gangs, including the Loners, Lobos, and Para-Dice Riders, \\"patched over\\" to the Hells Angels on December 29, 2000. This overnight placed the Hells Angels in a position of dominance in Ontario, and in effect put an end to any independent existence of the Satan's Choice Motorcycle Club. However, many former member of Satan's Choice would remain active criminals after the club was dismantled, such as the former president of the Hamilton chapter Ion Croitoru, who would be charged but not convicted of the murder of Lynn and Fred Gilbank in January 2005. The Outlaws would later find their Ontario operations crippled by \\"Project Retire\\", an undertaking by Ontario police targeting the club. In July 2017, a new biker gang calling themselves Satan's Choice emerged using the same patch, but otherwise not connected to Satan's Choice. Donny Peterson, the leader of the Hells Angels, used his Facebook page to attack the new club, writing: \\"Those who take a patch from a respected club, one that has history, courage, who has paid their dues, died, done time and all the rest...like what are you thinking? You are pretenders\\". Lorne Campbell stated that it was \\"insult\\" for the new club to use the name and patch of the former Satan's Choice and predicated violence. A spokesman for the group stated that they were considering changing their name. Filmography * Satan's Choice (1965). National Film Board of Canada. Directed by Donald Shebib.

Design and development The Astra-Protopescu, designed by Lieutenant-Colonel Stefan Protopopescu and built by the Romanian aircraft maker Astra at Arad was intended as a reconnaissance aircraft. It was a biplane with constant chord wings, straight-edged and slightly swept at about 2¬∞. Their tips were rounded. The lower wing was a little shorter and smaller in area, providing 47% of the total. The structure of the wings, like that of the rest of the aircraft, was entirely wood and they were each built around two spars. It was a single bay biplane with significant stagger; the wings were relatively displaced horizontally by and separated vertically by . The bay was formed by a parallel pair of interplane struts on each side, together with bracing wires; each pair of struts leaned forwards because of the stagger and also slightly outwards. The central upper wing was joined to the upper fuselage by cabane struts. These leaned outwards at the front and rear of the wing, the latter supplemented with a central, transverse inverted V-pair. Only the upper wing carried the long ailerons which occupied about 60% of the span. Its engine was a Hispano-Suiza 8F water-cooled V-8 with its radiator in the nose. The fuselage was basically of rectangular cross-section, though the upper fuselage was formed by a curved decking. The pilot's open cockpit was under the upper wing trailing edge; both the upper and lower trailing edges had cut-outs to improve his view. The observer/gunner sat in a second cockpit immediately behind the pilot, equipped with dual controls as well as cameras and radio. Three machine guns could also be mounted there. The fuselage tapered aft to conventional, unbalanced tail surfaces with a continuously curved tailplane and elevators positioned near the top of the fuselage. The fin and rudder were also smoothly curved together; the latter extended to the keel and worked in a rounded elevator cut-out. The Astra-Protopopescu had a conventional, fixed tailskid undercarriage. A short V-form strut was attached to each lower fuselage longeron, joined by a cross-piece at their apexes, above which a single axle bearing the main wheels was rubber sprung. The wooden tailskid was also rubber sprung. The exact date of the first flight of the Astra-Protopopescu is not known but its tests had been concluded by June 1925. Though the results were satisfactory and exceeded the parameters set by the Romanian Ministry for War, no orders are known to have followed.

Early life Roland Franklin was born in 1926 into an affluent and influential British Jewish family. His father, Ellis Arthur Franklin (1894‚Äì1964), was a merchant banker. His sister was Rosalind Franklin, the scientist whose research led to discovery of the structure of DNA. His brother is the bibliographer Colin Ellis Franklin. Banking and Business career Franklin is a merchant banker, and a former director of Keyser Ullman, the British merchant bank that failed in the 1973-74 banking crisis. He had a long business partnership with the corporate raider James Goldsmith. As Goldsmith began winding down his US operations in 1987, Roland Franklin set up the Pembridge group together with his son Martin E. Franklin. Together they undertook a series of transactions between 1987 and 1989, the largest of which was the $1.3 billion hostile takeover of the Dickinson Robinson Group (DRG). Roland Franklin appointed his son as the chief executive officer of DRG, with the goal of breaking up the conglomerate via a series of asset sales. Roland Franklin retired from active business in 1991, leaving Martin Franklin and Ian Ashken to oversee the final DRG asset sales. In 1992 they returned to the US with the intention of using their experience at DRG to build, rather than break up companies. Defence of Israel In June 2015, Franklin published an opinion piece in j., a Northern California Jewish newspaper, arguing that the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, also known as the Iran nuclear deal, would be \\"the first step on the path to World War III.\\" He went on to compare U.S. President Barack Obama to British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain prior to World War II, suggesting, \\"Obama is betraying Israel.\\".

Plot summary Chu Ju lives in China near the Gan River with her parents and her grandmother. When she is fourteen, her mother gets pregnant and her whole family hopes the baby will be a boy. At this time in China, the law states that each family may only have two children, and tradition says that each family must have a son. However, a baby girl is born, and so Chu Ju's father and grandmother both agree that the baby girl must be sent away to make room for a son, although Chu Ju's mother begs to be able to keep her baby. Chu Ju develops a love for her new sister, so she decides to make a sacrifice. Chu Ju runs away secretly. This way, her parents will only have one daughter, her new baby sister, Hua. First, Chu Ju gets a job on a fishing boat cleaning fish and mending nets. After that, she gets a job working with silk worms, but she and the other girls who work there are treated horribly. Chu Ju eventually writes a letter in protest of their unfair treatment, since she is the only one who knows how to write (her parents paid for her schooling, even though girls didn't normally receive educations). The girls are treated somewhat better, but Chu Ju loses her job. Subsequently, Chu Ju meets a woman named Han Na and gets a job helping her with her rice paddies. Han Na comes to love Chu Ju as a daughter, so when she dies, Han Na leaves land for Chu Ju. Four years after she secretly left home, Chu Ju decides to go home to visit her family. Her parents are overjoyed to see her. Chu Ju is relieved to see that her little sister, Hua, is safe and was not sent away. Chu Ju's mother has also had another baby when she was away.

Freeman, published between 1867 and 1879. Recognised by critics as a major work of scholarship on its first publication, it has since proved unpopular with readers, many of whom were put off by its enormous length and copious detail. Academics have often criticized it for its heavily Whig treatment of the subject, and its glorification of Anglo-Saxon political and social institutions at the expense of their feudal successors, but its influence has nevertheless been profound, many Anglo-Norman historians of modern times having come around to some of Freeman's main conclusions. Composition and publication Freeman first wrote about the Conquest while he was still a student at Oxford, where his 1846 essay \\"The Effects of the Conquest of England by the Normans\\" was submitted for, but failed to win, a prize. In 1859 and 1865 he published lengthy reviews of the last two volumes of Sir Francis Palgrave's History of Normandy and of England. Exploring his points of agreement and disagreement with Palgrave Freeman decided to embark on his own history of the Conquest, reasoning that its approaching 800th anniversary might well make such a work popular. He believed that he had so completely worked out his own position on the historical controversies involved that \\"there will be little more to do than write down what is already in my head\\". He began work on the History on 7 December 1865, writing to a friend that it was a book \\"which I can do easier than anybody else, as I have worked so much at the subject for twenty years past\\". In the event, Freeman's decision to trace the remoter causes of the Conquest in much greater detail than he had originally planned put paid to all hopes of bringing his history down to William the Conqueror's accession in time for the octocentenary. His first volume, taking the story as far as the death of Harthacnut, appeared in 1867; subsequent volumes in 1868, 1869 and 1871 dealt with the reigns of Edward the Confessor, Harold Godwinson and William the Conqueror respectively; and an 1876 volume explored the consequences of the Conquest in later reigns, with a final index volume in 1879. Freeman later issued two revised editions. Freeman aimed his History at both specialists and non-specialists. In an 1867 letter he wrote that > I have to make my text a narrative which I hope may be intelligible to girls > and curates, and in an appendix to discuss the evidence for each point in a > way which I hope may be satisfactory to Gneist and Stubbs. He drew on the massive corpus of primary sources published over the previous eighty years, and on the works of 19th-century historians, particularly Augustin Thierry, Sharon Turner, Sir Francis Palgrave, and J. M. Lappenberg, but he felt it unnecessary to search out manuscript material and never went to either the British Museum Library or the Public Record Office, preferring his own well-stocked bookshelves. He also corresponded with scholars such as J. R. Green, James Bryce, W. F. Hook, W. R. W. Stephens, and especially William Stubbs, for whom he always professed the greatest admiration, as did Stubbs of him. A contemporary rhyme went: > See, ladling butter from alternate tubs > Stubbs butters Freeman, Freeman butters Stubbs. Frank Barlow summarised Freeman's qualifications to write such a history: > a good knowledge of languages, including Anglo-Saxon, and an interest in > field archaeology and architecture, with the ability to sketch buildings and > their features. He was much involved in politics and not unreasonably > regarded participation in government as useful training for a > historian‚Ä¶Above all, he had tremendous zest. Marjorie Chibnall added that in his knowledge of medieval chronicles Freeman had no rival. As a set-off to this list Barlow noted Freeman's dogmatism, pugnacity and indifference to various subjects he considered irrelevant to his survey of 11th century England: theology, philosophy, and most of the arts. Freeman went on to publish a history of The Reign of William Rufus (1882), in two volumes. He also wrote a series of works on the Anglo-Saxon and Norman periods aimed at a popular readership: Old English History for Children, a work he had had in mind since before he began the History of the Norman Conquest, was published in 1869; A Short History of the Norman Conquest in 1880; and William the Conqueror in 1888. In 1974 J. W. Burrow produced an abridged edition of the History of the Norman Conquest of England. Themes Freeman was a man of deeply held convictions, which he expounded in the History of the Norman Conquest and other works with vigour and enthusiasm. These included the belief, common to many thinkers of his generation, in the superiority of those peoples that spoke Indo-European languages, especially the Greek, Roman and Germanic peoples, and in their genetic cousinhood; also in the purely Teutonic nature of the English nation. He asserted that the Anglo-Saxon invaders of England had largely killed or driven out the original Celtic inhabitants, though he admitted that \\"the women would doubtless be largely spared\\", an exception which fatally flawed his argument. His conviction of the racial purity of the Anglo-Saxon people was highly influential on later generations of writers. His enthusiasm for Anglo-Saxondom knew few bounds when it came to their social and political institutions, and to his greatest heroes. These included Alfred the Great, Earl Godwin and Harold Godwinson, though he also began increasingly to admire William for his policy of protecting his revolution by retaining Old English institutions wherever possible. Freeman placed much greater faith in Anglo-Saxon historical writings than in the Norman chronicles, which he considered vitiated by sycophancy to the Norman court. He had learned from Thomas Arnold a belief in the continuous and cyclical nature of history in general. Taking his cue from Francis Palgrave, Freeman applied this to early medieval history by making the thoroughly Whiggish claim that the first parliaments of the reigns of Henry III and Edward I had brought the country back to something like the Anglo- Saxon institution of the Witenaƒ°emot, or national council, and that the constitution of the country had evolved through the Conquest period rather than being entirely remade. An unbroken line thus connected the Witenaƒ°emot with Victorian democracy. This all had the effect of diminishing the significance of his own subject, since it meant that 1066 had for Freeman \\"not the importance either of a beginning or of an ending, but the importance of a turning point\\". Hammering the point home, he wrote that, > I cannot too often repeat, for the saying is the very summing up of the > whole history, that the Norman Conquest was not the wiping out of the > constitution, the laws, the language, the national life, of Englishmen. Reception The book's sales were healthy, but never so great as Freeman had hoped. Doubtless this was partly caused by the sheer off-putting size of his books, but perhaps also by the fact that his historical prejudices were quite out in the open, leading readers to wonder whether his conclusions could be trusted. Reviews of the History were respectful and in most cases favourable, though some reservations were expressed. The Gentleman's Magazine, for example, noted the harshness with which Freeman treated his opponents and his \\"unmistakably strong belief in the correctness of his own views\\", but agreed with many of them, excepting only his insistence on spelling Anglo-Saxon personal names (Ecgberht, √Ülfred etc.) in unmodernized form. The Saturday Review, the North American Review and the Literary World all agreed in regretting Freeman's indifference to social history, as opposed to political and military history. The Month, a Catholic magazine, objected only to Freeman's outspokenly Protestant opinions on the \\"abject superstition\\" of some of the medieval saints, and bade him keep a civil tongue in his head on this point. The Edinburgh Review reached a more ambivalent verdict than most. It praised him for finding a middle line between the conflicting views of Thierry and Palgrave on the importance of the Conquest, and acknowledged that on many important points \\"Mr. Freeman has pronounced a judgment which will be accepted as conclusive by all historical scholars\\", but it devoted much space to its impatience with Freeman's enthusiasm for Anglo-Saxon institutions and for his particular heroes. Chambers's Cyclop√¶dia of English Literature told a wide readership that the History was \\"among the great works of the present century\\". But in the later years of Freeman's life the book's reputation was injured by a series of attacks levelled on it by the genealogist and local historian J. H. Round. Round brought against Freeman the same kind of aggressively pedantic nit-picking that Freeman himself had been used to bring against other historians. Round was neither interested in nor knowledgeable about Anglo-Saxon history, but had \\"an instinctive feeling that in England our consecutive political history does, in a sense, begin with the Norman conquest\\". Part of his motivation was political: as a Conservative who detested Freeman's Liberalism he reached the damning verdict that Freeman \\"was a democrat first, and historian afterwards\\". Freeman and his supporters responded to Round's criticisms, but Round did not give up the attack. \\"Truth cannot be silenced, facts cannot be obscured\\", he wrote. \\"I appeal, sure of my ground, to the verdict of historical scholars, awaiting, with confidence and calm, the inevitable triumph of the truth.\\" Many of his attacks on Freeman were well placed, and their effect was to turn a whole generation of scholars against him, while to the general reading public, as Freeman himself acknowledged, \\"I seem to be either unknown or a subject for mockery\\". After Freeman's death in 1892 critical opinion slowly began to change. In 1906 Thomas Hodgkin, without endorsing the accuracy of Freeman's History, called it \\"the great quarry from which all later builders will hew their blocks for building\\", and as the 20th century advanced the tide continued to turn as academics examined Freeman's Norman Conquest with renewed interest, even if the general public did not. The historian D. J. A. Matthew considered it \\"one of the most cited but least read historical monuments written on any historical subject.\\" One exception was General George S. Patton, who in 1944 read Freeman's History in advance of the D-Day landings, hoping to learn where to conduct a campaign in Normandy by studying William the Conqueror's choice of roads. In 1953 David Douglas wrote that > as a detailed narrative of the Norman Conquest, Freeman's book has never > been superseded, and it is those best versed in the history of eleventh- > century England who are most conscious of its value. Frank Barlow saw Freeman's influence as being profound. Modern historians, Frank Stenton and Ann Williams among them, have again come to share some of his beliefs, including the existence of a degree of historical continuity across the Norman Conquest, and to view English and Norman events in the broader context of European history. In 1967 R. Allen Brown called the History \\"a notorious high-water mark in studies of 1066\\". In the present century Anthony Brundage and Richard A. Cosgrove have been more reprehensive, writing that the History‚Äôs > organization, judgments, and style strike the modern reader as well over the > top: uncritical and injudicious, remorselessly detailed, and a prose that > adored long, languid sentences. They nevertheless admit that > Even after knowledge of their shortcomings [is] taken into consideration, > his conclusions remain a powerful voice on behalf of a nation whose past and > present gloried in liberty, democracy and constitutional government and they acknowledge that Freeman's views on the English national identity have had a lasting influence.

The story combines paranormal abilities with themes of space and time travel. The underlying theme is intolerance of ordinary people towards those with unusual abilities. The novel is notable for long passages meditating on power, fear, and prejudice in people. The protagonist finds himself caught between people pursuing commercial power, some exploiting fear and anger for personal reasons, and others attempting to overthrow what they regard as evil institutions in the name of a greater good, but using questionable methods. There is a discussion with a Catholic priest on the nature of superstition, good, and evil. In the end the hero must create a new path for some to follow to escape persecution, while leaving the rest of humanity to deal with the world they have created. Time is the Simplest Thing was nominated, under its original title The Fisherman, for the 1962 Hugo Award for Best Novel, which was won by Stranger in a Strange Land. Plot The prologue of the novel relates how humanity gives up the dream of space travel, which is too difficult and dangerous and offers too little benefit, only to discover that there is another way to explore the universe. Some people possess the ability to travel with their minds to other worlds. Helped by new technology, they can explore another planet far across the galaxy while their bodies remain on Earth. Shep Blaine is an explorer working for Fishhook, an organization exploiting paranormal powers to explore planets around other stars. Because of anti-paranormal prejudice in the US, Fishhook operates in northern Mexico. Explorers spend time in \\"star machines\\", which are boxes shaped and decorated to stimulate the mind to leave the body and explore the universe. They are accompanied by a small machine that can record experiences and gather physical samples. Some explorers have returned with minds affected by what they encountered. Those explorers have disappeared and never been heard from again. Blaine returns from one expedition having encountered an intelligence that looks like a large pink blob sitting immobile in a room open to the sky. The blob greets him telepathically with the message \\"Hi pal! I trade with you my mind.\\" Blaine immediately feels the alien mind alongside his own. Returning to his body, he knows he must get away before the recording of his trip is checked. However he is impeded, first by Kirby Rand, Fishhook's head of security, and then by a friend who persuades him to go to a high society cocktail party. Realizing that fleeing to the US is the obvious thing to do, he goes along with this, since Fishhook would not risk the scandal of arresting him at the party, and he might find an opportunity to do something his pursuers are not likely to expect. At the party he meets Harriet Quimby, an investigative reporter who reveals herself to be a telepath. She knows he is in trouble and tells him to discreetly leave the party and meet her outside. His pursuers are waiting for him, but he escapes them as, for some reason, time slows down enabling him to slip past. Harriet uses her knowledge of back roads, practiced for situations like this, to escape with him. In the United States, he is separated from Harriet by local townspeople who identify him as a witch and intend to hang him. Again, something unexpected happens to the flow of time, placing him a short time in the past, which is a ghostly, decaying shadow of the world. He is able to walk out of the town before returning to normal time. He encounters Riley, an old man nursing a decrepit pickup truck on a journey north. They travel together for a while, discussing the state of the world. Fishhook is operating a commercial monopoly on the science and technology found in the galaxy, disrupting commerce and daily life while people lapse into superstition and hatred of paranormals. Some paranormals are retaliating by using their powers to terrorize people. They meet a group of young levitators who fly around at night. Riley shoots at them with a shotgun, but Blaine tries to make peace using his telepathy. He bonds with one young girl, Anita. He becomes separated from Riley, and enters a trance which results in him returning to visit the alien, who he calls the Pinkness. The Pinkness is far older than the human race, and has been traveling the universe, exchanging minds with beings of all kinds. Blaine settles in to learn from the Pinkness, but is abruptly returned to his body which has been in a coma for days. He is in hospital next to Riley, who is severely injured. Harriet shows up with Godfrey Stone, one of the travelers who disappeared. He claimed to have seen a world free of evil, and was sent to an isolated institution where he could have lived in comfort. He escaped, as did Lambert Finn, another explorer who found a place of total evil and became obsessed with eliminating Fishhook and all paranormal people. Harriet reveals that Riley was transporting a stolen \\"star machine\\" for Stone, but intended to give it to Finn for use in his campaign. Stone is killed by an unknown assailant, and the star machine is held by the police. Again Blaine is able to manipulate time, removing the star machine to the future, which is a formless void. Having done this, he is confronted by Kirby Rand, who has been tracking Blaine and the stolen machine. Fishhook is determined to maintain its monopoly at all costs. Finn is playing into their hands by keeping the technology illegal in the US. Blaine is about to be returned to Fishhook when he uses another part of the alien knowledge to escape. Confronting Finn, he uses his ultimate weapon: he trades minds with Finn. Finn is driven insane by the presence in his own mind of all the things he hates and fears. With Finn's mental state in his own mind, Blaine discovers that Finn had been secretly encouraging groups of paranormals to unleash a night of terror on Halloween, in order to turn the rest of the population against them. He leaves to spread a warning among the paranormals, but in the process is trapped in an icy storm and almost freezes to death. Ironically the horrors that Finn experienced, and that drove him to try to eliminate all paranormals, contained a clue to the ability to travel to other stars physically as well as mentally. Blaine uses this to find an Earth-like planet and travel there to escape the storm. He passes this knowledge to the other paranormals in the hope that they can escape the coming witch hunts. Returning to Finn he finds that the man has committed suicide. He decides to remain on Earth until all the paranormals have made it to safety.

In the quantum mechanics the domain space of the wave functions \\\\psi is the classical configuration space \\\\mathbb{R}^3. In classical field theory, the configuration space of the field is an infinite-dimensional space. The single point denoted A in this space is represented by the set of functions A_I (\\\\vec{x}) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^3 where \\\\vec{x} \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^3 and I represents an index set. In quantum field theory, it is expected that the Hilbert space is also the L^2 space on the configuration space of the field, which is infinite dimensional, with respect to some Borel measure naturally defined. However, it is often hard to define a concrete Borel measure on the classical configuration space, since the integral theory on infinite dimensional space is involved.Y. Choquet-Bruhat, C. Dewitt-Morette, M. Dillard-Bleick, Analysis, Manifold, and Physics, (North-Holland Publishing Company, 1977). Thus the intuitive expectation should be modified, and the concept of quantum configuration space should be introduced as a suitable enlargement of the classical configuration space so that an infinite dimensional measure, often a cylindrical measure, can be well defined on it. In quantum field theory, the quantum configuration space, the domain of the wave functions \\\\Psi, is larger than the classical configuration space. While in the classical theory we can restrict ourselves to suitably smooth fields, in quantum field theory we are forced to allow distributional field configurations. In fact, in quantum field theory physically interesting measures are concentrated on distributional configurations. That physically interesting measures are concentrated on distributional fields is the reason why in quantum theory fields arise as operator-valued distributions.Conceptual Foundations of Quantum Field Theory By Tian Yu Cao The example of a scalar field can be found in the references A.

Composition=Background MacMillan described the conception of the piece in the score program notes, writing: Structure The Piano Concerto No. 3 has a duration of roughly 25 minutes and is composed in five connected sections: #Baptisma Iesu Christi #Miraculum in Cana #Proclamatio Regni Dei #Transfiguratio Domini Nostri #Institutio Eucharistiae Instrumentation The work is scored for solo piano and an orchestra comprising three flutes (3rd doubling piccolo), two oboes, cor anglais, three clarinets (3rd doubling bass clarinet), two bassoons, contrabassoon, four horns, three trumpets, three trombones (3rd on bass trombone), tuba, timpani, three percussionists, harp, and strings. Reception Reviewing the world premiere, Larry Fuchsberg of the Star Tribune praised the concerto, writing, \\"The work, all 25 minutes of it, is a wild ride, overflowing with color and incident -- turbulent, incantatory and, at moments, luminous.\\" Reviewing a 2013 performance of the work with the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra, Mark Gresham of ArtsATL described the piece as \\"virtuosic for both pianist and orchestra\\" and described the audience's overall reaction, remarking: Jay Nordlinger of The New Criterion also lauded the piece, writing, \\"Though only twenty-five minutes, the concerto felt a little long to me. Does it have a 'heavenly length,' as would befit a religious concerto? I'm not sure. I look forward to hearing the concerto again. What is beyond doubt is that James MacMillan is a serious composer who loves music and has important things to say. He does not write frivolously‚Äîexcept when frivolity is called for!‚Äîand he writes well.\\" See also *List of compositions by James MacMillan References Concertos by James MacMillan 2008 compositions MacMillan 3 Music commissioned by the Minnesota Orchestra ","title":"Piano Concerto No. 3 (MacMillan)"},{"id":"48462711","title":"1992 Bulgarian Cup Final"},{"id":"48462728","text":"Charles Genty (17 June 1876, Jargeau, Loiret - 11 January 1956, Paris, France) was a French painter, illustrator, and caricaturist.

In 2013, she became the inaugural Billy and Audrey L. Wilder Professor in Tumor Immunotherapy. Research Yu and her team were the first to identify [as a critical regulator in processes influencing tumor cell growth and survival. They examined activation of the STAT3 protein, and determined that it helps to create an environment supportive of the tumor cell, protecting it from nearby immune cells. By examining and understanding STAT3's role in tumor angiogenesis and immune evasion, they have also identified a possible molecular target for cancer therapy. Stat3 siRNA is used to disable STAT3 production, while CpG binds to the tumor cells and stimulates immune cells. In this way, CpG-Stat3 siRNA can turn off the defense mechanism of cancerous cells and prompt the immune system to attack them. Using mice as an animal model, Yu is studying the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme and B-cell lymphoma, particularly aggressive tumors that are resistant to standard forms of treatment. trials with human patients were being planned.

It was built in 1853. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 30 April 1997.  History  The headstone and lone grave located near the junction of Tinana Creek and the Mary River adjacent to Cran Road known as Commissioner for Crown Lands John Carne Bidwill's grave site is a significant place in the history of the Maryborough region. It marks the final resting place for John Carne Bidwill who was Commissioner for Crown Lands from 1849-52. Bidwill played an important role in the early development of the Wide Bay region, acting as Police Magistrate, Harbour Master, and registrar for Births, Deaths and Marriages. Bidwill was however first and foremost a talented botanist and natural historian. He is believed to have introduced certain fruits, such as the mango, into Australia. Bidwill took specimen examples of the Bunya Bunya pine (Araucaria bidwillii) to London in 1843, a seedling of which was bought by Kew Gardens. During exploration of the Brisbane Valley and areas to the north in 1841 he found examples of a giant Australian water lily (Nymphaea gigantea). He was involved in experiments to hybridise gladioli, hibiscus and amaryllis. Bidwill's hibiscus crosses were the first scientifically created examples in Australia. John Carne Bidwill was born in Exeter, England, in February 1815. His father was a merchant. It is thought that his interest in botany was stimulated by two famous nearby nurseries owned by Veitch and Luscombe, Pince & Co. The Luscombe nursery was growing Australian plants in the 1830s. In 1832 Bidwill sailed aboard the \\"Exmouth\\" for Canada. After spending two years there he returned to England. In 1838 Bidwill and his sister Elizabeth sailed for Sydney to establish a branch of the family merchandising business in New South Wales. At the end of 1838 John Bidwill applied for a 2000-acre grant of land to the west of Sydney. However increasing costs per acre of land, a result of the pastoral boom in New South Wales in the period of the late 1830s, saw Bidwill withdraw his application. Bidwill at this time sent back to England his first collection of Australian seeds, which were raised into plants at Joseph Knights Chelsea Nursery. Bidwill left for New Zealand, arriving there in early 1839. He established two branches of the family business at Tauranga and Rotorua. Bidwill walked to Rotorua, collecting plant specimen's along the way. Two species were named after him resulting from his collecting through New Zealand, Halocarpus bidwilli and Brachyglottis bidwilli. His experiences in New Zealand saw him publish Rambles in New Zealand (1841). Bidwill returned to New South Wales, and sent the best of his New Zealand collection to John Lindley at the London Horticultural Society. Lindley did not publish Bidwill's work, and credited Ernst Diefenbach instead with his Bidwill's discoveries (Bidwill was to receive posthumous recognition). John Bidwill returned to New Zealand in 1840 with his brother to build up the family business, and to continue his explorations and expand his botanical collection. Specimens from this period are kept at the Hooker Herbarium, Kew Gardens. Bidwill returned to Sydney in 1841 and worked with Joseph Hooker son of the eminent botanist. Colonial Secretary Alexander Mcleay also requested during this period that Bidwill undertake the collection of native fruits for study. In furtherance of family business John Bidwill travelled to Moreton Bay in 1841, and began exploring to the north. He climbed the Glass House Mountains, and described a jasmine found on Mount Beerwah. It was known for a short time as Jasminum Bidwillii. Bidwill had also established a close relationship with the King and MacArthur families, and described and named a small orchid Dendrobium kingianum, which was named in honour of his friend Phillip Parker King. In 1841 Bidwill began work as an assistant in the Sydney Botanical Gardens, and also became a member of the Australia Club. Bidwill sailed to England in 1843, auctioneering off botanical specimens collected in Australia, as well as his gladioli hybrids. Bidwill returned to Australia in 1844, in company with his other sister Mary. On his return voyage he brought back to Australia specimens of bananas, apples, passionfruit and apricots. After his return he established his own nursery (thought to have been at Camden). Examples of his camellias are still grown in the Camden area. He also continued his experimentation on hybridising gladioli. Later in 1844 he again returned to New Zealand, sailing on to Tahiti. He attempted to establish a passionfruit plantation in Tahiti, which failed. He sent living examples of Tahitian orchids to England, but these were misdirected and sent instead to his father. Bidwill was appointed in mid 1847 to the position of Government Botanist and Director of the Sydney Botanical Gardens, by Colonial Secretary Earl Grey. Charles Moore was appointed to this position as a result of a bureaucratic mistake in London, and arrived to take up this position in January 1848. Bidwill acted in the capacity of Botanist and Director until the end of 1847. Bidwill then took his case to the Governor and requested that he be considered for any Crown Lands Commissioner's position then being created. He was appointed Commissioner for Crown Lands in November 1848 and confirmed Commissioner for the Wide Bay region. Bidwill travelled from Sydney to Brisbane on the Tamar arriving at Wide Bay village in December 1848. Bidwill after his arrival established a residence for himself on the banks of Tinana Creek, near the junction of the Mary River and the creek. His residence was some six kilometres down stream from the Wide Bay village. The village itself was renamed Maryborough in 1849, and subsequently proclaimed a township on 2 February 1851. Bidwill had erected for himself a cottage, stables and a barracks for his assistants in the Crown Lands work. The name Tinana, given by Bidwill to his residence and gardens as well as the creek nearby, is thought to have been inspired by the Maori leader Tinanah. The garden that Bidwill established was extensive, and during his time as Commissioner, Bidwill continued to collect and grow botanical specimen's as well as to experiment and grow fruit and vegetable plants. He continued forwarding plants to Kew Gardens. Bidwill however was unable to act as an efficient administrator in his job as Crown Lands Commissioner. In July 1849 Bidwill was involved in an altercation with John Daniel Mactaggart of Kilkivan station, a result of a remark made by Bidwill accusing him of selling sly grog to his workers. Mactaggart challenged Bidwill to a duel, which was refused. Mactaggart struck Bidwill with a stock whip demanding satisfaction. A charge of assault was brought against Mactaggart by Bidwill, and the case was heard in Brisbane in May 1850. Mactaggart was found guilty and sentenced to imprisonment. Bidwill was noted as sometimes exhibiting irrational behaviour during his term as Crown Lands Commissioner. He was considered a \\"harsh master\\", and disciplinarian. An employee of Bidwill's, George Dart who was later to become a well known identity in the commerce and social life of Maryborough claimed that Bidwill resorted on one occasion to purchasing and setting a man trap to halt the stealing of poultry, gardens and livestock by local Aboriginal groups. According to Dart the trap did catch an Aboriginal raiding the house garden, and the extent of injuries led to the \\"mercy\\" killing of the individual by one of Bidwill's workers. Bidwill himself shot at local Aboriginals on several occasions in an attempt to prevent their pilfering. On another occasion Bidwill chose not to intervene in the murder of a local Aboriginal that was committed by a settler George Fueber in the Maryborough settlement. The shooting was witnessed by Bidwill outside of Richard Palmer's Inn. He chose not to act intervene in the matter despite the fact that he was Chief Magistrate for the Wide Bay, and was therefore responsible for policing. Bidwill's property featured two gardens, the larger was at the junction of Tinana Creek and the Mary River. This featured most of the botanic and fruit specimens. The Commissioner's living quarters were situated at a higher elevation to the west of the \\"lower garden\\" and featured a \\"house garden\\" supplying pumpkins, sweet potatoes and yams. In 1852 he was ordered to mark a tree line for the use of drays, and to speed up the transport of prisoners from Maryborough to Brisbane. A more circuitous route then in use required five days of travelling between the two centres. Bidwill set out with horses and a dray from Tinana Creek and five other men. They cut a straight track through to Tahiti station, near Tiaro. Along the watershed of Tinana Creek the party followed a spur that divided Tinana Creek from the Mary River, and then travelled through the area of what later became Gympie. A temporary bridge was built over the Mary River in this area, and during its construction Bidwill was credited by George Dart with locating traces of gold, fifteen years before James Nash found the Gympie gold field. The party then proceeded further south in the direction of the Glasshouse Mountains marking the tree line. The party came across evidence of the remains of the large scale killing of a stolen flock of sheep taken from Marodian station near Miva. The group camped near this location for several days, when the cook of the party informed Bidwill that rations were running short. Bidwill believing that the party were near Durundur station decided to cut through the scrub with an assistant, Slade, to get rations. Both men's rations were exhausted in two days. For the next sixteen days Bidwill and Slade existed off snails, and edible roots identified by Bidwill. A party of Aboriginals rescued the starving men near Durundur station. The privations of the eighteen days, including eight without food severely affected Bidwill's health. Bidwill stayed for several weeks recuperating, before setting off for Brisbane in weakened state. Doctors in Brisbane sent him on to Sydney for further treatment. He returned to Maryborough, but despite the attendance of three doctors, one from Gayndah and two from Maryborough, died on the 16 March 1853 at the age of 38. He was buried amongst the plants of his botanical garden (\\"lower garden\\"). Cause of death was attributed to a severe kidney complaint. A Bunya pine was planted at each corner of his grave to mark its position. His brother Charles came from New Zealand to collect his personal effects, all other items of Bidwill's were auctioned. In 1854 Sir Charles Moore and Walter Hill (curator of Brisbane Botanical Gardens) made a collection of specimens from Bidwill's garden. Surviving trees from the collection are thought to be a Bunya Pine and Sausage Tree in Queen's Park, Maryborough. Other specimens were sent to Brisbane, Rockhampton and Ipswich. A lychee tree thought to be a surviving specimen from Bidwill's \\"lower\\" garden survives near the bank of Tinana Creek, approximately from the grave. Conservation work was carried out on this headstone in 1988. A sandstone headstone identifies the grave. John Carne Bidwill despite his enthusiasm and drive for botanical collecting and study is today largely an unknown figure in the history of Queensland, New South Wales and in the history of the South Pacific. The suburb of Bidwill in Maryborough, and a Parish near Maryborough are named after him, as well as the suburb of Bidwill in Sydney. Ten Australian and three New Zealand plant species are also named after him. Altogether thirty plants carry his name.  Description  Commissioner Bidwill's Grave is located on a rise, adjoining a sugar cane paddock, to the south of the junction of Tinana Creek and the Mary River, adjacent to Cran Road, Tinana. The grave has a gabled sandstone headstone, with two large diagonal breaks, which has been reconstructed with a compressed fibrous cement sheet fixed to the back and a concrete base. A lychee tree is located to the west of the grave.  Heritage listing  Commissioner Bidwill's Grave was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 30 April 1997 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Commissioner for Crown Lands John Carne Bidwill's grave, located near the junction of Tinana Creek and the Mary River adjacent to Cran Road, is important in demonstrating the growth of the Wide Bay district and the role of the first Commissioner for Crown Lands in the pre-separation period of Queensland history. It also marks the burial location of the first person commissioned to mark a new direct tree line for transport between the Maryborough-Wide Bay area and Brisbane replacing a more circuitous route via the Brisbane Valley. The grave and adjacent Lychee tree are the last surviving evidence of the residence and gardens that Bidwill created during the period of 1849-52 during his appointment as Crown Lands Commissioner in the Wide Bay district. Bidwill chose to establish his living quarters six kilometres downstream from the original village of Wide Bay and named the creek junctioning with the Mary River at this location, Tinana. He also established a large botanical garden for the growing of specimen plants on the property. Bidwill himself was an active and prolific collector and grower of botanical specimens, as well as hybridiser of flowering plants. Specimens collected by him during travels in Australia, New Zealand and the South Pacific are kept in the Kew Gardens collection. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The grave marks the burial location of the first Commissioner for Crown Lands appointed to the Wide Bay region in 1849, John Carne Bidwill. In the early years of the Wide Bay area (1849‚Äì52) Bidwill played an important role in its establishment. As the Crown Lands commissioner his duties included administration of the licences issued for Crown Lands, but also acting as Police Magistrate, Harbour Master, and registrar for Births, Deaths and Marriages. After his death in 1853 Bidwill was buried in the botanical garden he created, of which reportedly only one fruit tree, a Lychee, remains.

As of 2019, the entrance fee is free. Description Bentleyville is a free light display in Duluth, Minnesota. It is a non-profit organization open every day from November 23rd through December 28, 2019, from 5:00 pm to 9:00 pm on weekdays, and 5:00 pm to 10:00 pm on Fridays and Saturdays. It takes at least half an hour to walk through, depending on the weather, and complimentary hot cocoa, cookies, popcorn and marshmallows are available to all guests. There are 15 different fire pits that you can stop at to warm up about halfway through the lights. Kids are also able to stop and visit Santa through December 24; children aged 10 and under receive a new knit hat and bag of cookies. Bentleyville is also the official drop off site for new unwrapped toys and nonperishable food items for the Salvation Army. Food and toys donated at Bentleyville are distributed to 7 communities: Duluth, Cloquet, Virginia, Grand Rapids, Hibbing, International Falls, MN and Superior, WI. History Nathan Bentley first decorated his home with lights in Esko, Minnesota in 2001. He added more and more lights for the next two years to make his display bigger every year, eventually Bentley's house was known as \\"the house with all of the lights in Esko.\\" By 2003, Bentley transformed his house from a drive by to a walk through, with Santa visiting on the weekends. One of Bentley's friends eventually started referring to his house as Bentleyville (a play on words from Dr. Seuss's \\"Whoville\\"). Bentleyville \\"Tour of lights\\" was born. In 2004, the Bentleys moved from Esko to Cloquet, Minnesota. To get people and the usual visitors to come out to see it, Bentley built a larger and brighter display. He built a 78' x 24' entrance made with 45,000 lights to greet people. There were over 500 lit-up snowflakes hung from trees all over his property; dozens of displays were created and many were added every year. School groups and community musicians were added to add live entertainment. Fire pits were put in for visitors to gather around, warm up and roast marshmallows. Santa starting showing up every night as a permanent guest. Kids who came to visit Santa got a free winter hat and a bag of cookies. Eventually a building was constructed, where inside, free cookies, coffee and apple cider were offered. This became known as \\"The Cookie House\\". The \\"Popcorn House\\" was added soon after for visitors to enjoy free popcorn while walking through the lights. Move to Duluth The popularity of Bentleyville grew and so did the traffic. The Bentleys lived on a dead-end country road so there wasn't much room to park. After two years and 35,000 visitors, Bentley decided he needed to build parking lots in fields nearby with buses bringing the visitors to the entrance. In 2008, with 5 years of hosting Bentleyville at his houses, Bentley took a year off to think about how everything was working and to make it better. In the fall, the Duluth City Mayor, Don Ness, called Bentley asking if he would bring Bentleyville to Bayfront Park in Duluth, Minnesota for a year trial. Ness thought Bayfront Park was a perfect fit for Bentleyville. Bentley asked his original team members to organize the Christmas light show. He needed 600 volunteers and 10 weeks to help set up. Opening day On Friday, November 27, 2009 Bentleyville turned on its millions of lights for thousands of visitors for the first time in Bayfront Park. There was over 150,000 visitors that came to enjoy the sounds and lights of winter. Expansion On January 8, 2010 Bentleyville announced that it had decided to return to Bayfront Park for the next three years. Those three years helped with a lot of expansion in Bentleyville with adding the famous 128 foot lit up, animated tree as the main piece, right in the center of Bentleyville. Every year more and more displays were added, in 2011 Dino Land, a gift shop, more light tunnels, heaters in the line for Santa Claus, and a new home for Mrs. Claus was added. In 2012, Santa skydived into Bentleyville on opening night, visitors welcomed Thomas the Tank Engine in the displays, and the attendance made it to over 206,000 people.

Mrs. Martin. Scene breakdown and summary=Act 1Scene 1= Demetrius has just taken over the throne (as an impostor who is impersonating the dead son of the last king) and he has married Marina. The play begins in celebration of the marriage and Demetrius tells his subjects that he forgives everyone who supported the previous king and he will grant every request on this day. Zueski approaches Demetrius and forces himself to be kind to Demetrius even though he views him as a usurper. Zueski asks that his lover, Zarrianna, be released to him. She was held as prisoner by Demetrius after her family resisted Demetrius rulership. Demetrius grants Zueski's request, and asks that Zarrianna be brought to court before him. Sophia, enters and feigns happiness to see Demetrius. She knows that he is not her son, yet she goes along with his ruse as a self-protecting measure. Zueski arrives with Zarrianna. Demetrius is openly attracted to Zarrianna, and he commands her to attend Marina in the palace until the time of the wedding. Zueski is horrified at the notion of Zarrianna staying near Demetrius, but she assures him that she will be loyal to him and she will not succumb to sexual assault. Zueski reveals to Bosman Demetrius true identity as an impostor. Zueski in fact saw the real Demetrius die of wounds and witnessed the burial, but he did not want to be the sole voice to discover the current usurper's identity in what seemed to be a time of national unity. The details of the usurpation are revealed. After King Basivolitz's son Theodore died, the uncle Boris killed the other son, Demetrius, and took the throne. He imprisoned Sophia in a monastery, where she was kept until this day. The king of Poland and the Vaivode (Manzeck) helped to orchestrate the arrival of the impostor Demetrius; Boris was killed by the invading army, the gates of Moscow were opened to the impostor; the wife and sons of Boris were killed; Zueski took Zarrianna away to a monastery for safety. Zueski points out that he is now the nearest kin to the late Basivolitz and he will speak out against Demetrius with Sophia's help. =Scene 2= Basilius, Zaporjus, and Rureck suspect that Demetrius is an impostor and a tyrant, and the plan to gain the support of Sophia and the public before taking action. Manzeck complains that Demetrius is slighting his daughter, Marina, and he worries that Demetrius may divorce her. Act 2Scene 1= Alexander returns in disguise to the palace and finds his bride, Marina, married to Demetrius. It is revealed that Manzeck is behind Marina's marriage to Demetrius, as he tried to convince Marina to forget Alexander and he even forged a letter claiming that Alexander had married a German woman. Demetrius is convinced of Marina's innocence, and it is pointed out that the consummation of Marina and Demetrius's vows will not occur until the next day. =Scene 2= Demetrius tyranny increases and he plans to divorce Marina, and threatens to cut off her head if she doesn't quietly obey and leave. He also plans to convince Zarrianna to marry him. She has resisted him thus far, and if this continues, he plans to use force. =Scene 3= Demetrius walks in to find Zueski and Zarrianna together, and he is outraged, calling for Zueski's execution. Zarrianna tries to plead for Zueski's life and she begs to be killed with him, all to no avail. Zarrianna finally prevails with Demetrius, warning him that she could never love one who was so cruel to Zueski, and Demetrius calls back the guard to stay the execution order‚Äîonly to hear that it has already been carried out. Zarrianna is horrified and outraged, and she reveals that she and Zueski were already married. Zarrianna rails against Demetrius, telling him that she will never love him and that the only way she will forgive him is if he kills himself in front of her. Demetrius offers her the throne and warns her that he will rape her if she resists. Act 3Scene 1= Marina refuses to be quietly divorced from Demetrius: she would rather die than give up her dignity. Alexander appears as a pilgrim in disguise and Manzeck's deception is revealed to her. He asks that she come away with him to his father's court, and Marina seeks advice from her father. Demetrius is angry that Marina will not resign her title (and agree to divorce), threatening her with death. She threatens the rage of her father, and she is imprisoned. Demetrius orders that the Cossacks troops be made ready for battle. =Scene 2= Manzeck encounters Alexander and deeply regrets his actions, finally realizing that Demetrius is a usurper. Alexander and Manzeck encounter Zueski, whom they are happy to find still alive. Zueski tells them that Bosman (commander of the castle) is ready to hand the castle over to them. The men plan to overthrow Demetrius and to show the people that the usurper lacks the figure of a cross on his arm (something that the true Demetrius had). Act 4Scene 1= Zarrianna and Marina are in captivity together, and Zarrianna dreads the possibility of rape while Marina dreads death. Zueski and Alexander arrive in disguise, explaining Zueski's escape. Marina reminds Alexander that she is legitimately married to Demetrius and that she will not tolerate Alexander killing him‚Äîeven though she doesn't love Demetrius. Demetrius approaches, and‚Äîon Zueski's advice‚ÄîZarrianna feigns some affection for Demetrius in order to save Marina. Demetrius becomes hopeful, and Zarrianna asks that he not kill Marina until she has more time to decide whether she will give up her title. Demetrius agrees and departs. =Scene 2= Bosman warns Sophia that Demetrius plans to kill her, asking that she identity Demetrius as an impostor to the people. The time is now ripe for her to point out his falseness, now that the people are ready to revolt against his cruelty. Sophia agrees, regretting that she didn't betray him out earlier. Demetrius commands Bosman to kill Sophia and Marina‚Äîand to make it look like Mariana killed herself so as not to obstruct Zarrianna's relations with the king. Bosman ostensibly agrees, and Demetrius plans to kill Bosman after he carries out these executions. Act 5Scene 1= The revolt begins. Bosman's troops have taken control of the palace, but Demetrius has escaped to the city with a small army. News reaches Demetrius that doom is impending and he plans to rape Zarrianna, promising to have Mariana over to Carclos. Carclos goes to Marina and Zarrianna in disguise, and they agree to follow to see Zueski, Alexander, and Manzeck. The women arrive to find they were tricked and led to Demetrius. Demetrius and Carclos plan to rape the women before their enemies can storm this area of the palace. The women are horrified, wishing for death, and they are dragged off. Zueski, Alexander, and Manzeck arrive just as the women call for help from Providence, and they kill Demetrius and Carclos. The lovers are reunited (Alexander and Marina; Zueski and Zarrianna), and Manzeck blesses his daughter's new union. The people assert that they will follow Zueski as their new rightful ruler as long as Sophia agrees that Demetrius was an impostor; she does so. Everyone salutes Zueski. Marina requests that Demetrius be decently buried, which Zueski grants. ReferencesBibliography * Burling, William J. A Checklist of New Plays and Entertainments on the London Stage, 1700-1737.

It is commonly associated in fashion as a trend that originated from the artwork of Dutch painter, Piet Mondrian. However, other experts argue whether his artwork is the true origin of color- blocking. History Mondrian dresses by Yves Saint Laurent It's widely believed by most historians that Piet Mondrian, an artist that lived around 1900, whose paintings were a collection of stark lines and flat squares, inspired this current color-blocking trend. Mondrian valued simplicity and therefore experimented with how far he could simplify his work, maximizing simplicity while still maintaining recognizable, although abstract, geometric shapes. Mondrian later named this style of painting Neo-Plasticism. In Piet Mondrian's Neoplasticism movement, his art directly inspired the fashion world, as well as home d√©cor and baked goods. Although Mondrian is said to be the key figure of the modern art movement, there are others that believe the credit for this trend lies with Georges Seurat and Claude Monet. However sources report that it is Piet Mondrian who inspired other designers such as Yves Saint Laurent to create the famous Mondrian Dresses. Before Mondrian's aesthetic overtook the fashion world, pop art's materialization in the 50s opened America's eyes to a more vibrant but structured world. Pop Art incorporated the same clean lines and solid colors that Piet Mondrian's work encompassed. Proponents of the Georges Seurat and Monet origin theory claim that this novel acceptance lead to the color-blocking revolution. Mondrian's Neo-Plasticism aesthetic evolved through the decades, coming to include aspects such as synthetic color and a strong imposed structure in the 1960s. The color-blocking trend took off in the 60s as fashion designers like Yves Saint Laurent adopted this revolutionary aesthetic. It wasn't long before this new trend was reaching as far as London; the youth of London began wearing ensembles that would come to be known as mod fashion. Mod fashion much resembled the artistic style of Piet Mondrian; mismatched, solid color separates that were composed of blocks in different hues. Colour-blocking resurfaced in the 2010s as a trend in domestic interior design. Although some argue that color-blocking is a thing in the past, high fashion figures and enthusiasts believe that this retro trend continues to thrive as a result of the hipster generation who revive the trend and turn it into something seen as fashion-forward. Process In the fashion world, the process of color- blocking refers to wearing blocks of colors. Color-blocking is different from how people usually dress because the colors in the outfit are considered louder, or colors that clash. Fashion figures explain color-blocking as wearing multiple articles of solid-colored clothing in a single outfit. Traditional color-blocking consists of putting together two or three different, but complementary colors together in one outfit. It is also considered color-blocking even if the colors are not direct opposites on the color wheel. For example, yellow and orange are right next to each other, but adding purple (a color on the opposite of the wheel) creates a color-blocked outfit. Rules Fashion icons, designers, and figures have developed rules that go along with the art of color-blocking. Basic rules for color-blocking are centered on the colour theory. The colour theory states that there are unwritten rules in color-blocking such as not wearing too many colors together at once, and balancing an outfit with a neutral such as grey. Benefits Since color-blocking is an abstract form of art, it is easy to create illusions for accentuating body shapes, making people look taller and thinner. Color-blocking provides versatility to clothing that other trends and styles don't provide. Interior design Color-blocking has recently spilled over into home d√©cor and interior design. This trend takes the same idea in home design that is does in fashion: the colors are paired with no concern of matching. In the home color-blocking is used mainly in room d√©cor and walls. D√©cor clashing with each other, or in more mild cases the opposite colors complement each other to provide an interesting and refreshing atmosphere in a room.

The author, a Boston-based music critic and columnist, described the book as one that not only tells the story of Scott Miller and his bands Game Theory and The Loud Family, but also explores \\"the college and indie-rock explosion of the 1980s and 1990s,\\" and how some influential artists \\"managed to fall through the cracks.\\" Milano, who had long believed that the quality of Miller's work was \\"way out of sync with the amount of recognition he got,\\" began to contemplate writing the book soon after Miller's suicide in April 2013. Miller's death brought to the forefront Milano's feeling that it was \\"a bit of a crime\\" that Miller had never adequately been recognized during his lifetime. Explaining his motivations for writing the book, Milano stated, \\"Like a lot of people I was pretty shaken up by his sudden and self-inflicted death in 2013, and thought he should be honored in some way... there‚Äôs some earthshaking music here that I have to tell people about.\\" Citing comparisons to Big Star and Nick Drake in a 2016 interview, Milano expressed his hopes and expectation that Miller's music will be rediscovered, bringing Miller \\"after-the-fact acclaim.\\" The book's release coincided with an expanded reissue of the 1987 Game Theory album Lolita Nation, part of a series of reissues by Omnivore Recordings of Miller's long out-of-print Game Theory albums. An initial book proposal, focusing primarily on Lolita Nation, was submitted by Milano to the editors of the 33‚Öì book series. The proposal was rejected with \\"enough encouragement\\" that Milano decided to go further with the project, to research and write a full-scale biography, and \\"try to get a handle on who Scott was and how that played into the music he made.\\" The front cover, designed by Betsy Lescosky, echoes design elements used by Miller in numerous Game Theory album covers, including a distinctive bold italic font, with an oversized capital \\"G\\" framing a photo by Ana Morales of Miller performing with The Loud Family. Critical reception According to the Austin Chronicle, the biography's \\"no-nonsense\\" narrative never bogs down, using interviews to make the case for Miller's \\"two decades of genius.\\" Salons Annie Zaleski noted that the book was not sad but rather \\"humorous at times, and it brought to life why [Miller's] music was so compelling and smart.\\" References Books about musicians Biographies about musicians 2015 non-fiction books Scott Miller (pop musician) Books about rock music ","title":"Don't All Thank Me at Once"},{"id":"48462961","text":"Eze Nri Bu√≠f√® was the third king of Nri Kingdom after succeeding Eze Nri N√†m√≥ke.
