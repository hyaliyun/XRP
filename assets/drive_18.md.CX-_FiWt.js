Background John J. Keetch, a fire researcher in the southeast, wrote that \\"One of the prime objectives of the National Fire Danger Rating System (NFDRS) is to provide as accurate a measure as possible of the relative seriousness of burning conditions and thereby, NFDRS can serve as an aid to fire control programs.\\"Keetch, John J; Byram, George. 1968. A drought index for forest fire control. Res. Paper SE-38. Asheville, NC: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Southeastern Forest Experiment Station. 32 pp. (Revised 1988). In 1954 there were eight different Fire danger rating systems in use across the United States. Better communication and better transportation were beginning to make mutual assistance agreements between fire control agencies more practical than in the past. State compacts, and in the case of the Federal government, interagency and interregional agreements were bringing fire control teams together from widely separated areas of the county. It became necessary to establish a national system for estimating Fire danger and fire behavior to improve and simplify communications among all people concerned with wildland fire. Work on a national rating system began in 1959. By 1961, the basic structure for a four-phase rating system had been outlined and the fire phase (spread phase) was ready for field testing. However, since the remaining phases of the rating system - ignition, risk, and fuel energy - were not available, a number of fire control agencies preferred to remain with the systems then in use. Adaptations, interpretations, and additions to the spread phase quickly followed, making it obvious that the spread phase was not uniformly applicable across the country. More research followed and in 1965 a research project headquartered in Seattle was established to provide a fresh look at the needs and requirements for a national, fire-danger, rating system. After canvassing many fire control agencies across the country, the Seattle research group recommended new directions for research that would lead to the development of a complete, comprehensive, National Fire-Danger Rating System. A target date of 1972 was established for getting a complete system ready for operational use. In 1970, a preliminary version of the system was tested at field sites in Arizona and New Mexico. In 1971, an improved version of the system was used operationally in the Southwest. Field trials were also conducted elsewhere across the country at stations from Maine to California and from Florida to Alaska. The system then became operational nationwide in 1972.National Fire Danger Rating System (NFDRS) / John Wiley & Sons, Inc. http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/0471743984.vse8649/abstract When work started in 1968 on the NFDRS a framework was constructed. A philosophy had to be adopted in order to allow the development of the system to proceed. NFDRS provides a uniform consistent system that possesses standards which agencies with wildfire suppression responsibility can apply and interpret. NFDRS characterizes expected burning conditions for areas of 10,000 to 100,000 ac (4000 to 40,000 ha). The system has a low resolution.Burgan, Robert E. 1988. 1988 revisions to the 1978 National Fire-Danger Rating System. Res. Pap. SE-273. Asheville, NC: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Southeastern Forest Experiment Station. 39 pp. http://www.treesearch.fs.fed.us/pubs/593 * Considers initiating fires only. * Considers containment as opposed to extinguishment. * Relates containment job to flame length. * The ratings are to be interpretable and meaningful. * Ratings are to be used in combination. * Ratings are to be linear and relative. * Ratings between fuel models are comparable. * Ratings are for the worst case in the Fire Danger Rating Area. Types of fires NFDRS recognizes four types of fires:https://www.nwcg.gov/sites/default/files/products/pms932.pdf # Ground Fires burn in natural litter, duff, roots or sometimes high organic soils. Once started they are very difficult to detect and control. # Surface Fires burn in grasses and low shrubs (up to 4.ft tall) or in the lower branches of trees. Surface fires may move rapidly. Ease of control depends upon the fuel involved. # Crown Fires burn in the tops of trees. Once started, they are very difficult to control since wind plays an important role in crown fires. # Spotting Fires can be produced by crown fires as well as wind and topography conditions. Large burning embers are thrown ahead of the main fire. Once spotting begins, the fire will be very difficult to control. Structure NFDRS is a complex set of equations with user-defined constants and measured variables to calculate the daily index and components that can be used for decision support. A Fire Danger Rating level.takes into account current and antecedent weather, fuel types, and live and dead fuel moisture (Deeming and others 1977, Bradshaw and others 1984). Preparedness Classes The bottom line of the National Fire Danger Rating System in the day-to-day operation of a fire prevention and suppression program is the staffing class. The staffing class is sometimes referred to as the action class, adjective class, precaution class, preparedness class, or the Industrial Fire Precaution Level (IFPL). The assumption behind staffing levels is that the continuum of fire danger can be divided into discrete intervals to which preplanned management actions are keyed. In other words, for each staffing level or adjective class, there should be a management action that addresses the dispatch of suppression resources that constitutes an appropriate level of response. Staffing levels, or adjective class ratings, are ways of linking fire danger information to fire management decisions. The designations for the various class or staffing levels are numerical (I to IV), or adjective (Low to Extreme). The first step in establishing staffing levels is the selection by the state or federal land management agency of an NFDRS component or index that best describes the total fire problems in their protection area. Both state and federal land management agencies in Washington use the Energy Release Component (ERC) to determine staffing levels or adjective class ratings for the general public. From statistical analysis of historical fire weather data, agencies were able to determine various percentiles in the distribution of historical ERC data that serve as breakpoints for various fire management decisions. Land management agencies in Washington use the 90th and 97th percentile of the ERC as a basis for determining staffing levels. In Western Washington, the 90th and 97th percentiles in the ERC frequency distribution are 44 BTUs per square foot and 55 BTUs per square foot. Outputs The output section of the NFDRS structure chart is the components or simply the outputs that are based in fire behavior description.but expressed in the broader context of fire danger rating.http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/sew/fire/olm/nfdr_com.htm # Spread Component - Displays a value numerically equivalent to the predicted forward rate of spread of a head fire in feet per minute. It is a function of fuel model characteristics, live fuel moistures, the 0 to dead fuel moisture (heavily weighted to the 1-hour timelag fuels), wind speed and slope class. It is highly variable from relative humidity, wind, and live fuel moisture. # Ignition Component - Displays the probability of a firebrand causing an ignition requiring a suppression action. # Keetch-Byram drought index # Burning Index - An NFDRS index relating to the flame length at the head of the fire, it is an estimate of the potential difficulty of fire control as a function of how fast and how hot a fire could burn. It has been scaled so that the value, divided by 10, predicts the flame length at the head of a fire. For example, an index of 75 would predict a flame length of . It is a function of the Spread Component and the Energy Release Component and has moderate variability. It is sensitive to fuel models.and can trace seasonal trends reasonably well for models with heavy dead or live components. Because it uses wind and relative humidity, it is also very sensitive to weather observation errors.http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/sew/fire/olm/nfdr_ind.htm Adjective Class Levels Fire Danger is expressed using these levels.https://gacc.nifc.gov/rmcc/predictive/nfdrs_gaining_understanding.pdf Gaining and Understanding of the National Fire Danger Rating System. NWCG PMS 932 July 2002 # LOW - Fuels do not ignite readily from small firebrands although a more intense heat source, such as lightning, may start fires in duff or light fuels. # MODERATE - Fires can start from most accidental causes, but with the exception of lightning fires in some areas, the number of starts is generally low. # HIGH - All fine dead fuels ignite readily and fires start easily from most causes. # VERY HIGH - Fires start easily from all causes and, immediately after ignition, spread rapidly and increase quickly in intensity. # EXTREME - Fires start quickly, spread furiously, and burn intensely. All fires are potentially serious.

He received considerable public attention in 1963 when he appeared for the prosecution in the Great Train Robbery trial. In 1964, James was asked to chair the statutory inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the Metropolitan Police's Detective Sergeant Harold Challenor's being able to plant evidence and assault suspects.Parliamentary anser mentioning appointment of James as chair of inquiry In 1965 he was appointed a High Court Judge, assigned to the Queen's Bench Division. He received the customary knighthood on his appointment. He was elected to an honorary fellowship of Jesus College in 1972. He was promoted to the Court of Appeal in 1973 and was sworn as a member of the Privy Council accordingly. He had a reputation as a hard-working judge. When he was a member of the Court of Appeal, it was once said (albeit with some exaggeration) that James made more decisions on criminal cases than the rest of his fellow judges put together, when taking into account decisions made without open court hearings. He was a member of the Parole Board from its foundation in 1967 to 1970 (serving as deputy-chairman in 1970). He chaired the 1971 Tribunal of Enquiry into the failure of the Vehicle and General Insurance Company.

History The station signed on in September 1952 as WRAP, a daytimer at 1050 kHz, powered at only 500 watts.Broadcasting Yearbook 1953 page 303 It was required to sign-off at sunset to avoid interfering with other radio stations on AM 1050, primarily XEG in Monterrey, Mexico. In 1956, another Norfolk daytimer, 860 WCAV, left the air, allowing WRAP to relocate to AM 850. On the new frequency, WRAP could broadcast around the clock. The daytime power was increased to 5,000 watts and the nighttime power to 1,000 watts.Broadcasting Yearbook 1957 page 268 WRAP was programmed to Norfolk's African-American community. Its call sign used the word \\"RAP,\\" an African-American English word for \\"talk\\" or \\"discussion.\\" (It would be several decades before \\"rap\\" began referring to a musical style.) An advertisement in the 1957 edition of Broadcasting Yearbook, using the descriptions of the era, said \\"Survey figures show the most Negroes in the Norfolk area listen most to WRAP.\\" It added that WRAP, at 850 kilocycles, was \\"the only all-Negro station in Norfolk.\\" For more on the history of the station, see WRAP (Norfolk). In 1987, WRAP was acquired by local cable TV company Clinton Cablevision (later Sinclair Telecable).Broadcasting Yearbook 1991 page D-247 The new owner flipped the format to talk. The call sign was changed to WNIS, standing for News and Information Station. The R&B; format and WRAP call letters moved to AM 1350 in nearby Portsmouth (now gospel- formatted WGPL). WNIS picked up programming from ABC Talkradio, NBC Talknet and the Mutual Broadcasting System's Larry King Show. The host who launched the new format was Gordon Hammett, a New York City radio veteran who had more than 40 years in the industry with stints that included WNBC, WMCA, and WNEW. He started a club called the Tidewater Talkers for his loyal listeners. His guests ranged from Sen. John Warner to Al Goldstein. In July 1997, WNIS and its sister station, WTAR, switched dial positions. WNIS moved to AM 790, while WTAR took over the 850 kHz spot on the dial.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 1998 page D-461 850 has the stronger signal, broadcasting at 50,000 watts by day, the highest power authorized for commercial AM stations by the Federal Communications Commission.

In present terms Epsom, Leatherhead and Ewell are almost uniformly called towns: for example at the county level of local government when it considers service provision and population analysis -- the first two were granted market town status in the Middle Ages.

The majority of its area forms the modern Borough of Elmbridge, with the remainder forming part of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames in Greater London. History Elmbridge appears in the Domesday Book of 1086 as Amelebrige an area used for strategic, secular purposes with a Hundred Court where local wealthy and powerful figures met about once a month.Surrey domesday book It also had in early centuries a small number of owners who attempted to charge and collect rent of all of the owners of the main manageable medieval asset in the country, the manors. =Etymology= The name refers to a bridge over the River Mole, which was originally called the River Emel Plea Rolls of the Court of Common Pleas: CP 40/561; http://aalt.law.uh.edu/AALT2/H4/CP40no561/bCP40no561dorses/IMG_1051.htm; 5th entry, line 6 or Amele, a word possibly meaning 'misty' and later had the alternate form Emlyn; the bridge may have been between Hersham and Esher and specifically close to the crossing of today's A244 road. Elmbridge's name thus did not derive from elm trees which appeared on the Surbiton Urban District Council municipal arms and continue in the Elmbridge municipal arms. =Scope= Parishes within the hundred were: *Cobham *Esher *East and West Molesey (the divide occurred during the heyday of the hundred's economic significance). *Stoke D'Abernon *Thames Ditton (part containing the manors of Imber Court and Weston which with common land formed/forms Weston Green) *Walton-on-Thames *Weybridge At times it also included: *Tolworth and Chessington. Surbiton had an elm tree on its crest as its area once lay within the Elmbridge hundred.Civic heraldry =Use and decline= Its economic unity was shattered like most hundreds given the rise of smaller manors and newer manors which came to form the main, manageable agricultural asset throughout the country. It occupied just less than the central to north-west twelfth of the county. The Victoria County History collated the medieval documents such as feet of fines and using these supports a date of about 1200, which would tie it in the grant of a liberty by King John, as when it passed to the borough of Kingston to be held \\"at fee farm\\" being kept farmed and free from (land that was never cultivatable, termed waste). In 1280 it was said to be in the hands of their tenant Reginald de Imworth, with whose manor of Imworth it descended until 1499, when Richard Ardern died seised of the manor of Imworth and half the hundred, held of (i.e. under and subject to a rent to) the men of Kingston. Within the hundred there were several exempt jurisdictions. In 1253 John D'Abernon was successful in his claim to view of frankpledge in Stoke D'Abernon, and Avelina, daughter of Geoffrey de Cruce and wife of Roger de Legh, also claimed the right in Walton. In a Subsidy Roll of about 1334 the area was valued at ¬£24 0s. 6d, although it is not clear if this was a collective tax demand figure of the manors of the hundred.

The Slocan Valley is located in the Selkirk Mountains which were created 200 million years ago, during the Jurassic period. History The valley has been the home of the Sinixt people since time immemorial. When silver was discovered near Sandon in the 1890s, thousands of prospectors arrived in the valley, but by 1910, many of the small towns had become deserted. Larger silver-base metals mines produced through the 1970s e.g. the Ottawa mineOttawa mine and the Arlington mine on Springer Creek and the Enterprise mine on the namesake creek. Since then, a legacy of settlement from people disaffected with government has occurred in the Slocan Valley. A group of pacifists, the Doukhobors (originally a Russian sect of Christianity) arrived to farm in nearby Brilliant in 1908 and later spread into the Slocan Valley. During the Second World War, a policy of Japanese Canadian Internment saw many Japanese Canadians (including a young David Suzuki) re-located to internment camps in the valley, some of whom have stayed. In 1967 self-proclaimed war resisters of the Vietnam War, attracted to the Green Power movement (see Maclean's Magazine May 1968) and welcomed by the existing contingent of Russian pacifists, started making the valley their home. Since the 1970s, the population has steadily increased as telecommuters, commuters, people interested in a rural lifestyle and the children of earlier immigrants have worked to make themselves a suitable home. Tourism The Slocan Valley is a stop spot for tourists. Popular activities include mountain biking, rafting on the Slocan River, back country skiing, rock climbing at the Slocan Bluffs, and access to the Valhalla Provincial Park.

A former second baseman who appeared in 200 Major League Baseball games for the Pittsburgh Pirates (1948‚Äì49; 1951), Basgall became a longtime member of the Los Angeles Dodgers' organization who served as the bench and infield coach for Hall of Fame managers Walter Alston and Tommy Lasorda for 14 seasons (1973‚Äì86). During that time, he worked with four National League pennant winners (, , and ), as well as the 1981 World Series-champion Dodgers. During his playing career, Basgall stood tall, weighed and threw and batted right- handed. Playing career Basgall was born in Pfeifer, Kansas, graduated from high school there, and attended Sterling College. He signed with the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1942, the first year of the United States' involvement in World War II. After one season in the minors, he served in the U. S. Army for three yearsBaseball in Wartime before resuming his baseball career in 1946 with the Double-A Fort Worth Cats of the Texas League. In December 1947, the Dodgers traded Basgall to the Pirates, where he played one full season () and parts of two others ( and ). In 1949, he was the Pirates' starting second baseman for 98 of the club's 154 games. But Basgall's MLB playing career was hampered by poor offensive production; he batted only .216, .218 and .209 in his three years in the majors, with 110 total hits. Pittsburgh sent him to the top-level Hollywood Stars of the Pacific Coast League in 1952, and he spent four years in the PCL before starting his managing and coaching career. Manager, coach and scout After managing farm teams in the Pirates' organization from 1956‚Äì58, he returned to the Dodgers as a scout and minor league infield instructor in 1959, serving a dozen years in that role before becoming the Dodgers' Double-A manager in 1971.

It was released in August for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360; Mafia II: Director's Cut was released by Feral Interactive in December 2011. The game is a sequel to 2002's Mafia and the second installment in the Mafia series. Set within the fictional Empire Bay (based on New York City, as well as aspects of Chicago, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Boston and Detroit) during the 1940s and 1950s, the story follows Sicillian-American mobster and war veteran Vito Scaletta, who becomes involved in a power struggle among the city's Mafia crime families while attempting to pay back his father's debts and secure a better lifestyle. The game is played from a third-person perspective and its world is navigated on-foot or by vehicle. The player character's criminal activities may incite a response from law enforcement agencies, measured by a \\"wanted\\" system that governs the aggression of their response. Development began in 2003, soon after the release of the first Mafia game. At release, Mafia II received generally positive reviews from critics, with praise particularly directed at the story, though the restrictive world design was criticized. Its successor, Mafia III, was released in 2016. A remastered version of the game, entitled Mafia II: Definitive Edition, was developed by d3t Limited and Hangar 13, and released by 2K Games on 19 May 2020. The Definitive Edition was also included in the Mafia: Trilogy pack, released on 25 September 2020. Gameplay The player character engaging in a gunfight with the authorities. Police awareness in the game works in a similar manner as with the previous game, although the player can now bribe after committing an offense. However running from the authorities will still result in them shooting the player. The game is set in the 1940s‚Äìearly 1950s era of Empire Bay, a fictional city based on New York City, Chicago, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Boston and Detroit.Interview: 2K Czech discusses 'Mafia II' There are 50 vehicles in the game as well as licensed music from the era. Depending on the weather during the course of the game, vehicles handle differently. For example, during the early chapters in winter, vehicles are more likely to slip on the road due to the ice. Many firearms from the previous game return, such as the Thompson submachine gun and Colt 1911, as well as a pump-action shotgun. New World War II‚Äìera weapons, the MG 42 and the Beretta Model 38, also appear in the game. Interacting with objects in the environment involves two action buttons: a standard action and a \\"violent\\" action (for example, when stealing a car, the player may choose to either pick its lock or break the window glass), used in context-sensitive situations. A map is included as in the original Mafia game, but the checkpoint system has been completely overhauled. New controls include a cover system that allows the player to take cover behind objects (such as generators, walls and large crates) and shoot enemies, rather than just entering an arbitrary crouch pose behind them. This feature provides tactical support against enemies and has become a crucial technique of the genre. The game's cutscenes are created by the game engine in real-time. For example, if the player is riding in a car and a cutscene starts, the player will be driving the same car with the same condition (damaged or intact) and will be wearing the same clothes. There are exceptions, however, such as the opening sequence and the cutscene that depicts the Empire Arms Hotel explosion in Chapter 10, which are pre-rendered video clips. The game features three different in-game radio stations (Empire Central Radio, Empire Classic Radio and Delta Radio) with licensed music, news, and commercials. The radio stations include music from different genres including rock and roll, big band, rhythm and blues and doo-wop, with licensed songs by Chuck Berry, The Everly Brothers, Dean Martin, Little Richard, Muddy Waters, Buddy Holly & The Crickets, Bing Crosby, Bill Haley & His Comets, The Chordettes, Ritchie Valens, Bo Diddley, Ricky Nelson, Eddie Cochran, The Champs, The Drifters, The Fleetwoods, Screamin' Jay Hawkins, Nat King Cole, The Chords, and The Andrews Sisters. Synopsis alt= =Setting= Set nearly a decade after the first game, Mafia II takes place between two distinct time periods ‚Äî the mid-1940s, and the early 1950s ‚Äî within the fictional U.S. city of Empire Bay; the game's first chapter takes place in an unnamed town within Sicily, while the sixth is set within a prison somewhere outside Empire Bay. The city is situated on the United States' eastern coastline and divided by a river, and consists of several districts, including wealthy suburbs, slums and tenement blocks for the city's different immigrant races, including Irish, African-American, Chinese, and Italian, and large-scale industrial complexes, with the city supported by a large port, a railroad station, a major prison outside its city limits, several parks, and a collection of shopping malls and supermarkets. The game's main story sees the city divided between a number of criminal outfits, including three mafia families‚Äîthe Falcone family, Vinci family, and Clemente family‚Äîa Chinese Triad outfit, the Irish Mob, and several street gangs. The city's design, including the architectural styles, cultures, public transportation and landmarks, are influenced from real-life American cities, including New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Boston and Detroit, from within the two respective time periods used in the game. Two of the game's DLC packs, The Betrayal of Jimmy and Jimmy's Vendetta, also take place in the early 1950s, but in a different canon, as the setting features mostly new gangs and characters. The third DLC, Joe's Adventures, is set during the events of the main storyline and bridges the gap between the two time periods. =Plot= In 1943, Sicilian immigrant Vito Scaletta is arrested during a robbery and opts to join the United States Army to avoid jail. During Operation Husky, he is captured by the Italians, but watches in awe as his would-be executioners surrender to the Allies on the orders of a local Mafia boss. After returning home to Empire Bay in early 1945 due to an injury he sustained, Vito reunites with his childhood friend Joe Barbaro, who supplies him with counterfeit discharge papers, and learns that his late father left his family in debt to a loan shark. He briefly works for his father's former employer Derek Pappalardo, who then recommends him to Henry Tomasino, a made man in the Clemente crime family, due to his own connections with Joe. Working alongside Joe for both Henry and caporegime Luca Gurino, Vito secures enough money to pay off his father's debt, but is arrested for the theft and sale of ration stamps and sentenced to ten years in prison. While imprisoned, he befriends Leo Galante, the consigliere of Don Frank Vinci, but learns his mother passed away and all the money he obtained is spent on her funeral. In 1951, Vito is released early thanks to his connections to Leo. Reuniting with Joe, the pair work their way up the ranks of the Falcone family, led by Don Carlo Falcone and his underboss Eddie Scarpa. After Vito rescues two of Carlo's men from Luca, whom he leaves for dead, he earns Carlo's respect, who makes him and Joe made men within his organisation, allowing them to secure a better lifestyle. Not long after, learning that the Clementes are conducting drug operations, against the traditions of the Commission, Carlo orders Vito and Joe to assassinate Don Alberto Clemente. Following the hit, Henry approaches Eddie through Vito in search for new employment, and is ordered to kill Leo. Although Vito warns Leo and helps him escape the city, the Falcones nevertheless welcome Henry into the family. Vito finds his personal life falling into a turmoil after his sister Francesca distances herself from him because of his mobster lifestyle, and his house is destroyed in a firebombing by the Irish Mob. To rebuild his fortunes, Vito joins Joe and Henry to profit from the sale of heroin bought from the city's Triads. However, Carlo, who is also conducting drug operations behind the Commission's back, learns about this and demands a cut of their profits. When Vito and Joe go meet with Henry to discuss the matter, they witness him being publicly executed by the Triads, who then escape with their money. In retaliation, the pair kill Triad enforcer Zhe Yun Wong, despite his claims that Henry was a federal informant, but fail to retrieve the money. In debt to loan shark Bruno Levine, whose money they borrowed for the heroin deal, Vito and Joe take on jobs to pay off the debt, including the assassination of retired mobster Tommy Angelo. Vito also kills Derek after learning he ordered his father's murder. When the Vinci family kidnaps and tortures Joe, Vito saves him, but the pair learn that their actions have sparked war between the Mafia and the Triads. After paying off his debt to Bruno (revealed to be the same loan shark his father was indebted to), Vito is called by Carlo to the planetarium for a meeting. On the way there, Leo and Triad boss Mr. Chu pick him up and the former chastises Vito for the problems he caused, before revealing that Carlo wants to kill Vito for vouching for Henry, who was indeed an informant. However, grateful to Vito for saving his life, Leo has arranged a deal with the Commission and the Triads to spare Vito if he kills Carlo, who is also marked for dead because of his ambitions to become the sole mob boss in Empire Bay and his involvement with drugs, which caused the conflict in the first place. At the planetarium, Vito discovers that Carlo offered to make Joe a caporegime if he killed him, but the latter refuses and sides with Vito, helping him kill Carlo. Afterwards, Vito leaves with Leo to celebrate, while Joe is driven off in a separate car, leading Vito to ask where he is being taken. Leo reveals that their deal did not cover Joe, much to Vito's shock, who watches helplessly as his friend is taken away to whatever fate awaits him. Development Preliminary work on Mafia II began in 2004; the work on the script began in 2003. Originally intended for a PlayStation 2 and Xbox release, the game was moved to the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in 2005, following difficulties with the developer of the game engine. It was officially revealed in August 2007 at the Leipzig Games Convention. A playable version of the game was achieved in 2007 or 2008. Mafia II was expected to release in late 2009, but was delayed until its release in August 2010. A promotional trailer was released for the game in August 2007. A second trailer was released on the Spike VGA show on 14 December 2008. An extended version of the trailer was released on 15 January with an extra 30 seconds of cut scene footage. The first gameplay footage debuted on GameSpot on 17 April 2009 as part of an interview with Mafia IIs producer, Denby Grace. The video shows driving and gunplay aspects to gameplay as well as portraying the physics engine. A third trailer was uploaded to the website on 28 May 2009. From 1 June 2009, four short videos are to be added to the Mafia II website. The first of these is called \\"The Art of Persuasion\\" and features the song \\"Mercy, Mr Percy\\" by the female singer Varetta Dillard. Another video was released featuring footage from the mission \\"The Buzzsaw\\". The video reveals the fate of \\"The Fat Man\\" who appeared in the earlier trailers. On 27 March 2010, a new trailer was released showcasing the PhysX- based cloth and physics system used in the game. On 3 August 2010, Sheridyn Fisher, the face of Playboy Swim 2010, became the official ambassador for Mafia II. Sheridyn's involvement with Mafia II highlights the agreement between 2K Games and Playboy magazine to use 50 of their vintage covers and Centerfolds in Mafia II as part of the in-game collectibles integration. A demo for the game was released on 10 August 2010 on Steam, Xbox Live Marketplace and PlayStation Network. Release Mafia II was released on 24 August 2010 in North America, 26 August in Australia, and 27 August internationally. =Pre-order bonuses= On 26 May 2010 four content packs were offered as pre-order bonuses in America and European countries, each one available through different retailers. The Vegas Pack containing two additional cars and suits for Vito and the War Hero Pack containing two military-style vehicles and suits was available from GameStop and EBGames. The Renegade Pack containing two sports cars and two jackets was available from Amazon and the Greaser Pack featuring two hot-rods and two suits were available to Best Buy customers. These pre-order packs are available for purchase as game add-ons on the PlayStation Network, Xbox Live and Steam. On 26 May 2010, a collector's edition was announced for Mafia II. =PlayStation 3 version= The PlayStation 3 version became subject to controversy on 2K's Mafia II forums when 2K's interactive marketing manager Elizabeth Tobey stated that the PlayStation 3 version would be missing certain graphical details that were present in the Windows and Xbox 360 versions including three dimensional grass, pools of blood forming under dead bodies and realistic cloth physics. These details were said to be present in earlier builds of the game, but had to be removed to increase the game's frame rate. Upon release, the PlayStation 3 version received the same or higher review scores than the Xbox 360 version from Destructoid and Nowgamer (sites that review the game on multiple platforms rather than the normal practice of reviewing a single platform) due to additional content. =Downloadable content= Three downloadable content (DLC) packs were released for the game: The Betrayal of Jimmy is the first DLC pack, announced by Sony on 15 June 2010 at E3 2010. It was initially released exclusively to the PlayStation 3 as a free add-on to the base game, before being later ported to the other platforms. Set in a different canon from the base game, the story follows a gun-for-hire named Jimmy, who works for both the Irish Mob and Gravina crime family to undermine rival gangs, before being set up by his employers and arrested. Missions are structured in a non-linear manner like Grand Theft Auto, and include a score attack feature in which players earn points for doing certain actions; both features would return in the second and third DLC. Jimmy's Vendetta is the second DLC pack for the game. It was released on PlayStation Network, Xbox Live Marketplace, and Steam on 7 September 2010. The story picks up from the events of \\"The Betrayal of Jimmy\\", as Jimmy escapes from prison and exacts revenge on those who framed him. Joe's Adventures is the third and final DLC, released on 23 November 2010. The story bridges the gap between the two time periods in the base game's story, and features Joe Barbaro as the protagonist, who is forced to leave Empire Bay for five years due to a hit put on him by Luca Gurino, but returns in 1950 and works his way up the ranks of the Falcone family, in the process uncovering a plot to overthrow Don Carlo Falcone by the family's then- underboss. The DLC combines standard missions with score-based, open world missions. It is estimated to provide eight hours of gameplay. = Alternative editions = Mafia II: Collector's Edition is a steelbook which includes 9 items: Made Man Pack (two classic luxury automobiles and two ‚Äúmade man‚Äù suits, including a vintage tuxedo), Art Book (photo album-style about the design process of the game), CD of the Orchestral Soundtrack (recorded by the Prague FILMHarmonic Orchestra), and a Map of Empire Bay.

The game is a prequel to Mafia II and takes place in 1938, bridging the gap between Mafia and Mafia II. The story centers around Marco Russetto, a soldato in the Salieri crime family and the nephew of the family's gunsmith Vincenzo, who travels to Empire Bay in search for Tommy Angelo, who betrayed the family and was responsible for its downfall. Along the way, he finds work for Falcone family, with Don Carlo Falcone promising to help find Tommy, but Marco soon becomes caught too deep in the power struggle between Empire Bay's Mafia families and risks not only failing to find Tommy, but also losing his own life. =Definitive Edition= A remastered version of Mafia II with updated graphics titled Mafia II: Definitive Edition was released on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Microsoft Windows on 19 May 2020. The owners of the original Steam version had their copy of the game updated to Definitive Edition at no additional cost.https://mafiagame.com/news/mafia-ii-definitive- edition-out-now The Definitive Edition, which includes all of the story expansion and style packs, was developed by D3T Ltd. The Definitive Edition was later included in the Mafia: Trilogy pack, which was released on 25 September 2020 and also includes a remake of the first game, titled Mafia: Definitive Edition, and a version of Mafia III comprised with all story expansion packs. Reception =Critical response= The original release of Mafia II received \\"generally favorable reviews\\" from critics, while the Definitive Edition remaster received \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Greg Miller of IGN gave the game 7/10, calling it \\"a solid little game that'll give you a fun ride ‚Äì just don't expect the world.\\" Kevin VanOrd of GameSpot gave it 8.5 and stated: \\"Mafia IIs exciting action and uncompromising mob story make for an impressive and violent adventure.\\" Matt Bertz of Game Informer gave it a 9.0/10, writing that \\"in an era when video games are moving away from relying on cinematics for storytelling, Mafia II draws on the rich mobster film history to weave a gripping drama about family, friendship, loyalty, betrayal, and pragmatism.\\" The most negative review came from John Teti of Eurogamer who gave the game a 4/10 and wrote that \\"Mafia II gets the last word by destroying the myth that the mafia is interesting at all. It contends that the mob world is a hell of boredom populated by aggressively stupid automatons. These drones wake up each morning, carry out a series of repetitious tasks, and return home.\\" Zero Punctuation Ben Croshaw called the game \\"generic\\", and noted the main characters' similarities with the main characters of Grand Theft Auto IV, but criticised the lack of features prevalent in other sandbox games. He also criticised the mundane parts of the game, such as driving, making the game feel \\"unnecessarily padded\\". Controversies =Removed content= There was a significant amount of content removed from the final release of Mafia II. This removed content includes cut storylines, locations, characters, game modes, melee weapons and stores; various players have found leftover remnants for all of these features in the game's files. There was particular controversy caused when a car-destruction mission from the main game, as previewed at Gamescom 2009, was removed from the final release, and ended up re-appearing in the Joe's Adventures DLC, leading fans to question whether content had been removed from the main game to create additional content. =Reactions from mob victims and civic groups= Sonia Alfano, a member of the European Parliament and president of Italy's association for the families of Mafia victims, called for the game to be banned. Alfano's father Beppe was murdered by the Mafia in 1993. Take-Two Interactive quickly responded to the issue, stating that the game's depiction of the American Mafia was no different from organized crime films such as The Godfather. They also responded to allegations of racism from Unico National, who claimed that the game portrayed Italian-Americans unfairly and \\"indoctrinating\\" youth into violent stereotypes. Mafia II has the most profanity in a video game, particularly the word fuck, which is spoken 397 times, beating previous record holder, The House of the Dead: Overkill. On 22 August 2015, digital sales of the PC version of Mafia II were suspended on Steam and other digital retailers for unexplained reasons. The game was restored to Steam on 1 June 2016. Sequel On 28 July 2015, 2K Games announced the sequel Mafia III. The game, which was released on 7 October 2016, takes place in the city of \\"New Bordeaux\\", based on New Orleans, Louisiana, in 1968, seventeen years after the events in Mafia II. The protagonist, Lincoln Clay, is a black veteran of the Vietnam War, who returns home to find that his former gang is facing problems. The developers stated that they wanted to stray away from traditional Italian mob characters from the first two Mafia games in this installment, although the game still features an Italian Mafia family that serve as the game's main antagonists. The game features several callbacks to Mafia II, including the return of Vito Scaletta, who plays a supporting role in the game.

Brooding birds Pelicans in the Danube delta The species of brooding birds occurring in the Danube Delta were classified into 12 main biotopes, the classification criterion being represented by the nesting place where they show the greatest relative density. As to their dynamics, the brooding birds include: 44 sedentary species and 132 migratory ones. The great number of migratory species is explained by the optimal conditions of nesting and especially of feeding the deltaic biotopes are providing in the warm season of the year. This phenomenon is also supported by the presence ‚Äì in different deltaic biotopes as against the common ones ‚Äì of some species, which in the rest of their area cover other life environments. Non-breeding birds The species of non-brooding deltaic birds were classified into the biotopes they visit while resting on the Danube Delta's territory and they are connected to by the way these biotopes are providing their food. The ornithological biotopes of the Danube Delta belong to three well-individualized habitats, namely the aquatic, the amphibian and the terrestrial ones. The non-brooding species include: 35 winter species visit the Danube Delta only in winter; 46 passage species which cross the delta's territory only in spring and in autumn; 6 erratic ones which irregularly show up in different biotopes and 11 accidental species. The number of biotopes increases from the aquatic to the terrestrial environment, while their dimensions follow an inverse proportionality, as they are smaller in the terrestrial and larger in the amphibian and aquatic environments. Geographical origin According to their geographical origin, the delta birds contain the following types: arctic species (27); Siberian (32); European (108); Mediterranean (29); Mongolian (33); Chinese (2). The transpalearctic type contains 43 species. For Romania's latitude ‚Äì delta included ‚Äì the north-originating species (Arctic and Siberian) appear as winter-and passage birds, while the south-originating species (European, Mediterranean and Mongolian) are met with as sedentary and summer species. Further comments upon the manner birds migrate - namely the causes, which start on migration - and upon the way they orient themselves during migration, resulted in the hypothesis of the \\"inner time\\" and \\"inner space\\", which, along with their known senses, allow the migratory birds to perfect the migratory act in time and space. An interesting ethologic aspect appearing enhanced by the conditions of the Danube Delta (especially by the floods) is represented by egg laying in common nests. Thus, as a consequence of the general lack of egg-laying places, especially at flood time when a great part of the aquatic- species nests are flooded, the birds this way affected go on laying eggs in alien nests either belonging to the same species or to species of the same families. The following up of the tropic regime of the deltaic birds according to its origin had in view to know the food cycles, especially as final production represented by birds, the classification of these latter in categories with aquatic, mixed and respectively terrestrial nutritive regimes. In this respect, the delta birds appear as having a trophic regime of predominantly aquatic origin owing to the huge quantity the nutritive biomass of this milieu is produced in the Danube Delta in the warm season of the year. While the sedentary species generally close their trophic chains at the delta's level, the migratory, the passage, and the wintertime species annually carry away from the Danube Delta a great part of the nutritive biomass accumulated while resting in this territory. As far as the habitats are concerned, the species of the aquatic ones almost exclusivity feed from the aquatic millennium, while those living in the terrestrial habitat hardly have 50 per cent terrestrial food, the remainder having a mixed and aquatic origin. Many species owe their presence or existence in the delta ‚Äì in rather high densities as compared to the rest of the area ‚Äì just to this food richness. The contrast created between the great food abundance available as compared to the existence for some species of plenty of sites for nest location resulted in the simple and mixed form of colonial nesting. Such an observation and interpretation of the colonial nesting origin in the Danube Delta may constitute an argument for properly explaining the colonial nesting phenomenon in different regions or the globe.

It was geographically consonant with the southern two thirds of Borough of Reigate and Banstead together with two parishes in Tandridge and fractions of former parishes in the London Borough of Croydon and Borough of Crawley, West Sussex. Accordingly, it included the medieval-established town of Reigate with its motte castle and land which become the towns of Redhill and Horley. Scope The Reigate hundred included the parishes of: Betchworth, Burstow, Buckland, Charlwood, Chipstead, Gatton, Horley, Leigh, Merstham, Nutfield and Reigate.British History online In the Domesday Book of 1086, the hundred was known as Cherchefelle; in 1199 it became known as Reigate. Reigate Castle lay within the Reigate hundred Demise Urban and rural sanitary districts alongside earlier poor law unions were organised to reflect the Industrial Revolution in a less manorial and parochial, patchy way in the 19th century. By the end of that century, civil parishes had subsumed the remaining civil functions of the vestry of each parish in the region, and many new functions such as road laying were passed to Surrey County Council which, with central government bodies, took on their remaining purpose, that of national and local poor relief taxation.. Modern settlements and administration The division of land amounts to the southern two-thirds of the borough of Reigate and Banstead subjected to reduced boundaries losing approximately 4.7 square kilometres (plus the loss of outlying easterly Burstow and Nutfield to Tandridge and loss of Gatwick Airport to West Sussex much of which was in Horley and Charlwood) -- in 1933 a relatively large of Chipstead and of Merstham in the north were lost to elevated Coulsdon within Greater London.Chipstead CP at Vision of Britain The History of Parliament Trust, University of Portsmouth and others.Merstham CP at Vision of Britain The History of Parliament Trust, University of Portsmouth and others. As with Chipstead, Coulsdon is in an upper valley and plateau of the North Downs however has more railway stations and is a post town. It is the least dense former parish in the London Borough of Croydon. Horley has become the town of the south of the borough and one of the four towns shown the borough logo -- Reigate and Redhill are in the historic hundred, leaving Banstead to the north which was not. The post and railway town of Redhill (RH postcode area) which did not exist in the early 19th century has become during the 20th century and beyond a major town on land formerly in Reigate and Merstham, expanding into the latter into the 21st century with little buffer between the three settlements today; the three forming a conurbation keeping boundaries close to the far side of the Greensand Ridge and North Downs, to the south and north respectively. Even in the 19th century rural and a rotten borough, Gatton apart from Upper Gatton within the M25 has become part of Reigate and of Redhill, indivisible from those towns while retaining Gatton Park occupied by a co-educational independent school, The Royal Alexandra and Albert School. A fraction of its land has been opened up to the public by the National Trust but is now approximately half residential land in Reigate and Redhill. Burstow's main settlement and 'village' today has become what was once its medium-sized hamlet or neighbourhood of 'Smallfield' and it has spawned an entirely independent village since the early 20th century, Outwood, Surrey. Salfords and Earlswood are a village and suburb to Redhill-Reigate, which occupy former fields and woodland of Horley and Reigate. Brockham, from the 1900s a hamlet of village size, was formally created a civil parish from the western of Betchworth in 1933.

It is endemic to the archipelago of Socotra in Yemen. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical dry forests and subtropical or tropical dry shrubland. Scottish botanist Isaac Bayley Balfour described this species in 1884 from material collected from the Yemeni island of Socotra, where he recorded it was common. The species name is derived from the Latin adjective arbusculus \\"small tree\\". Two subspecies are recognised. Balfour had visited Socotra in 1880 and collected many plants. Within the large genus Euphorbia it is classified in the subgenus Euphorbia section Tirucalli. The nominate subspecies arbuscula has a tree-like habit, reaching 6 m (20 ft) tall. It has cylindrical greyish green branches. Subspecies montana is smaller, reaching 2 m (7 ft) in height. There are leaves only on the newest shoots, the plants' other greener branches photosynthesise sunlight instead. The leaflets are eaten by goats, both when the leaves are dried out and when they are green and fresh. For that reason, this species is often planted near settlements. Herders who seek to harvest food for their herd should avoid chopping off whole branches, or violently beating the branches to knock off the leaflets, in which case the plant is less likely to recover. This plant flowers during the hot, dry season and is able to survive severe drought, assuming it is not abused by herders. Its pores close during the day, to minimize transpirational water-loss, as part of its crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM).Brown, Gary and Mies, Bruno.

It was founded by Micha≈Ç Kruszka in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in June 1888. History Kruszka had come to the United States in 1880 and relocated in 1883 to Milwaukee, where he became an insurance salesman. His real calling in life, however, was journalism, and he attempted to begin a Polish-language weekly Tygodnik Anonsowy (Advertising Weekly), soon followed by another weekly, Krytyka. With backing from a group of Polish labor leaders, Kruszka began a daily paper, Dziennik Polski, in 1887. All three papers failed financially in relatively short order. After borrowing $125 from friends, Kruszka made one final attempt with another daily called Kuryer Polski the following year. The paper proved to be a success. Kruszka died on December 2, 1918. Editorial views Kruszka was passionate in his political views and used the Kuryer as a springboard for his ideas. He advocated labor reforms, independence for partitioned Poland, and representation for Poles within the local Roman Catholic Church hierarchy. His half-brother Wac≈Çaw Kruszka, a priest, was a frequent contributor to the paper. The aggressive Kuryer editorials eventually put it at odds with Milwaukee Archbishop Sebastian Gebhard Messmer. In 1906, Archbishop Messmer and his allies funded an alternative paper, Nowiny Polskie, which was more sympathetic to the official positions of the church. The new paper received endorsement from the Milwaukee Archdiocese, as well as from Pope Pius X himself, as the proper source of news and opinion for Milwaukee's Polish community. Micha≈Ç Kruszka was, of course, outraged. The battles between the two Polish-language papers became bitter and personal. The Kuryer attacked Nowiny's editor Father Bolesaus Goral as a drunk and alluded to improper sexual conduct by the priest. The Kuryer began to refer to the paper as the Nowiny Niemiecki (German News), a reference to those who dominated the Catholic Church in Milwaukee. Polish priests sympathetic to the Nowiny blasted the Kuryer from the pulpit, and criticized Kruszka's decision to send his daughter to public, instead of Catholic, school. The Milwaukee Polish Church War was in full swing. On February 12, 1912, in a pastoral letter, Archbishop Messmer declared that anyone reading the Kuryer or the Dziennik Narodowy, Kruszka's paper in Chicago, would be denied sacramental absolution for their sins: \\"Should any such Catholic dare to go to confession and communion without confessing or telling to the priest that they still read or subscribe to the papers mentioned, let them understand that ‚Ä¶ they commit horrible sacrilege.\\" Kruszka filed a lawsuit in Wisconsin courts stating that the Archdiocese had severely damaged his business financially by this order. He lost the suit as the courts ruled that: \\"Recommending to the members what they should read under pain of expulsion of church communion is within the jurisdiction of every pastor and prelate of every church.\\" With the appointment of Father Edward Koz≈Çowski as Auxiliary Bishop in Milwaukee, the conflict between the Kuryer and Archdiocese eventually subsided. Despite the sanctions from the church, the Kuryer continued to outsell the Nowiny by a large margin. The Kuryer continued to publish until its closure on September 23, 1962.

Accessed 2008-01-16. His father was an immigrant from Ireland who had served on the Northumberland, the ship which took Napoleon into exile on St. Helena. MacGahan moved to St. Louis, where he worked briefly as a teacher and as a journalist. There he met his cousin,\\"MacGahan, Januarius Aloysius\\", in Concise Dictionary of American Biography (1964), New York: Scribner's. General Philip Sheridan, a Civil War hero also of Irish parentage, who convinced him to study law in Europe. He sailed to Brussels in December 1868. MacGahan did not get a law degree, but he discovered that he had a gift for languages, learning French and German. He ran short of money and was about to return to America in 1870 when the Franco-Prussian War broke out. Sheridan happened to be an observer with the German Army, and he used his influence to persuade the European editor of the New York Herald to hire MacGahan as a war correspondent with the French Army. In France, Russia and Central Asia MacGahan's vivid articles from the front lines describing the stunning defeat of the French Army won him a large following, and many of his dispatches to the Herald were reprinted by European newspapers. By the age of twenty-seven, he was a celebrity. When the war ended, he interviewed French leader L√©on Gambetta and Victor Hugo, and, in March 1871, he hurried to Paris and was one of the first foreign correspondents to report on the uprising of the Paris Commune. He was arrested by the French military and nearly executed, and was only rescued through the intervention of the U.S. Minister to France. In 1871 MacGahan was assigned as the Herald's correspondent to St. Petersburg. He learned Russian, mingled with the Russian military and nobility, covered the Russian tour of General William Tecumseh Sherman and met his future wife, Varvara Elagina, whom he married in 1873. He learned in 1873 that Russia was planning to invade the khanate of Khiva, in Central Asia. Defying a Russian ban of foreign correspondents, he crossed the Kyzyl-Kum desert on horseback and witnessed the surrender of the city of Khiva to the Russian Army. There he met a Russian Lieutenant Colonel, Mikhail Skobelev, who later became famous as Russian commander during the Russian-Turkish War of 1877‚Äì78. MacGahan described his adventures in a popular book, Campaigning on the Oxus and the fall of Khiva (1874). MacGahan was also married to the daughter of an old Russian noble family. In 1874 he spent ten months in Spain, covering the Third Carlist War. In 1875, he voyaged with British explorer Sir Allan William Young on his steam yacht on an expedition to try to find the Northwest Passage from the Atlantic to the Pacific. The expedition got as far as Peel Sound in the Canadian Arctic before it met pack ice and was forced to return.  Investigation of Turkish atrocities in Bulgaria (1876)  In 1876 MacGahan quarreled with James Gordon Bennett Jr., the publisher of the New York Herald, and left the newspaper. He was invited by his friend, Eugene Schuyler, the American Consul-General in Constantinople, to investigate reports of large- scale atrocities committed by the Turkish Army following the failure of an attempted uprising by Bulgarian nationalists in April 1876. (See April Uprising.) MacGahan obtained a commission from the Daily News, then the leading liberal newspaper in England, and left for Bulgaria on July 23, 1876. He became a member of the American investigation commission of the US Consul- General in Constantinople, Eugene Schuyler, together with the Constantinople correspondent of K√∂lnische Zeitung, German journalist Karl Schneider (1854‚Äì1945); Georgian prince Aleksi Tsereteli (Aleksei Tseretelev) - governing secretary of the Russian embassy in Constantinople; and Turkish and Bulgarian translator Petar Dimitrov, an instructor at the American Robert College in Constantinople.Maria Todorova, Imagining the Balkans, p. 106, Oxford University Press 2009 After visiting Philippopolis on July 28, and Peshtera and Pazardjik on August 1 and 2, MacGahan travelled to the village of Batak, and sent the paper a graphic report of what he saw: > ...We looked into the church which had been blackened by the burning of the > woodwork, but not destroyed, nor even much injured.

MacGahan reported that the Turkish soldiers had forced some of the villagers into the church, then the church was burned and survivors tortured to learn where they had hidden their treasures. MacGahan said that of a population of seven thousand, only two thousand survived. According to his account, fifty- eight villages in Bulgaria had been destroyed, five monasteries demolished, and fifteen thousand people in all massacred. These reports, published first in the London Daily News, and then in other papers, caused widespread popular outrage against Turkey in Britain. The government of Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli, a supporter of Turkey, tried to minimize the massacres and said that the Bulgarians were equally to blame, but his arguments were refuted by the newspaper accounts of MacGahan. Following the publication of MacGahan's articles, William Ewart Gladstone wrote a pamphlet called Bulgarian Horrors: \\"I entreat my countrymen,\\" he wrote, \\"upon whom far more than upon any other people in Europe it depends, to require and to insist that our government, which has been working in one direction, shall work in the other, and shall apply all its vigour to concur with the states of Europe in obtaining the extinction of the Turkish executive power in Bulgaria. Let the Turks now carry away their abuses in the only possible manner, namely, by carrying off themselves....\\" In 1876 Ivan Vazov dedicated a poem to Macgahan called –ñ–∞–ª–±–∏—Ç–µ –Ω–∞ –º–∞–π–∫–∏—Ç–µ (The Sorrows of the Mothers). Russian-Turkish War (1877‚Äì78) MacGahan's grave, identifying him as the \\"Liberator of Bulgaria\\". New Lexington Cemetery, in his hometown of New Lexington, Ohio. In the wake of the massacres and atrocities committed by the Ottoman forces during the suppression of the April Uprising, as well as centuries-long conflicts between Russia and Turkey in Crimea, the Russian Government, stirred by anti-Turkish and Pan-Slavism sentiment, prepared to invade The Ottoman Empire, and declared war on it on April 24, 1877. The Turkish Government of Sultan Abdul Hamid II appealed for help to Britain, its traditional ally against Russia, but the British government responded that it could not intervene \\"because of the state of public feeling.\\" MacGahan was assigned as a war correspondent for the Daily News, and, thanks to his friendship with General Skobelev, the Russian commander, rode with the first units of the Russian Army as it crossed the Danube into Bulgaria. He covered all the major battles of the Russo-Turkish War, including the siege of Pleven and Shipka Pass. He reported on the final defeat of the Turkish armies, and was present at the signing of the treaty of San Stefano, which ended the war. The 1877 invasion prompted this sardonic comment from MacGahan: ‚ÄúI can safely say I have done more to smash up the Turkish empire than anybody else‚Ä¶except the Turks themselves.‚Äù He was in Constantinople, preparing to travel to Berlin for the conference that determined the final borders of Bulgaria, when he caught typhoid fever. He died on June 9, 1878, and was buried in the Greek cemetery, in the presence of diplomats, war correspondents, and General Mikhail Skobelev.See Six years later his body was returned to the United States and reburied in New Lexington.

Whilst practicing in the Tibetan Buddhist Tradition, Sravasti Abbey monastics ordain in the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya. It is situated on of forest and meadows, outside of Newport, Washington, near the Idaho state line. It is open to visitors who want to learn about community life in a Tibetan Buddhist monastic setting. The name Sravasti Abbey was chosen by the 14th Dalai Lama. Thubten Chodron had suggested the name as Sravasti was the place in India where the Buddha spent 25 rains retreat (varsa in Sanskrit and yarne in Tibetan), and communities of both nuns and monks had resided there. This seemed auspicious to ensure the Buddha's teachings would be abundantly available to both male and female monastics at the monastery. History The Abbey was founded in 2003. Its founder, Bhikshuni Thubten Chodron, is an American who was ordained in 1977 by Kyabje Yongdzin Ling Rinpoche, the Dalai Lama's senior tutor. She lived and studied in India and Nepal for many years, and her teachers include the Dalai Lama, Tsenzhab Serkong Rinpoche and Thubten Zopa Rinpoche. Under her guidance, Sravasti Abbey has male and female monastics train together as equals, and uses social service as a key component of community life. At the same time, the Abbey cultivates the traditional Buddhist values of non-harming, mindfulness, compassion, inter-relatedness, respect for nature and service to all sentient beings. The Abbey has a monastic residence called Gotami House, named after Mahapajapati Gotami who was the first woman to request and receive ordination from Buddha Shakyamuni. There is also a residence for guest teachers and a guesthouse called Chenrezig Hall. The Abbey is notable because it is home to a growing group of fully ordained bhikshunis (Buddhist nuns) practicing Buddhism in the Tibetan tradition. This is notable because the tradition of full Buddhist ordination for women was not transmitted from India to Tibet. Ordained women practicing in the Tibetan tradition usually hold a novice ordination. Thubten Chodron, while following the teachings of her Tibetan teachers, has arranged for her female students to seek full ordination as bhikshunis in Taiwan. On October 2, 2006, Jan Howell became the first person to ordain at Sravasti Abbey, taking her sramanerika (novice) and sikasamana (probationary) ordinations with Thubten Chodron as her preceptor in 2006. Also in 2006, the Abbey launched its first annual week-long Young Adult Retreat in order to bring Buddhist solutions to situations facing today's youth. The Abbey has regularly practiced posadha (the bi-monthly confession) since 2011. In January 2014, the Abbey began its first winter varsa (three-month monastic retreat), which lasted until April 13, 2014. As far as the Abbey knows, this was the first time a Western bhikshuni sangha practicing in the Tibetan tradition had done this ritual in the United States and in English. On April 19, 2014 the Abbey held its first kathina ceremony to mark the end of the varsa. Also in 2014 the Abbey held its first Pavarana rite at the end of the varsa. In October 2015, the Annual Western Buddhist Monastic Gathering was held at the Abbey for the first time; it was the 21st such gathering. In November 2015, the Abbey purchased their neighbor's property and named it Tara's Refuge. In 2017, the Abbey's first bhikkhu, Thubten Losang, was ordained. In 2018, Prajna Cottage was completed and Thubten Chodron moved into it.https://sravastiabbey.org/enews-february-2018/ Also in 2018, the Abbey community ordained Rebecca Bradley, which as far as the Abbey was aware marked the first such ordination in their Vinaya lineage (Dharmaguptaka) given by an all-Western sangha.https://sravastiabbey.org/2018-annual-report-is-here/ Daily schedule The Abbey's daily schedule begins at 5:00 a.m. when both monastic and lay students perform preparatory practices and tasks such as water bowl offerings. Morning meditation practice begins at 5:30 and lasts an hour and a half. A simple breakfast is offered at 7:30. Praises to Tara is chanted first, and the meal offered to the Three Jewels. The meal is eaten in silence until a gong is rung halfway through. From 8:30 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. residents ‚Äúoffer service‚Äù performing tasks. Lunch is offered at 12:00. Before eating, an information Dharma discussion is led by Thubten Chodron, other monastics or sometimes guests. These talks (and other teachings) are uploaded daily onto Sravasti Abbey's channel . Before eating, residents recite and reflect on five contemplations to remind them of their motivation for eating: > I contemplate all the causes and conditions and the kindness of others by > which I have received this food. I contemplate my own practice, constantly > trying to improve it. I contemplate my mind, cautiously guarding it from > wrongdoing, greed, and other defilements. I contemplate this food, treating > it as wondrous medicine to nourish my body. I contemplate the aim of > Buddhahood, accepting and consuming this food in order to accomplish it. The food is then offered to the Three Jewels before eating. Like breakfast, the meal is eaten until silence until a gong is rung halfway through, to reflect on the five contemplations and that day's teachings. Lunch is the main meal, as many monastics do not eat in the evening. The Abbey is vegetarian and, following the monastic precepts of the Chinese tradition, avoids onions, garlic, leeks, and radishes. Community members take turns cooking. Guests sometimes help as well. There is another period of offering service in the afternoon (2-4:30), followed by a short, informal ‚Äòmedicine meal‚Äô at 6:00 p.m. Evening practice begins at 7:00 pm and lasts an hour and a half. Subsequently, people read or meditate in their rooms.  Monastic education  The daily schedule forms one aspect of monastic training at Sravasti Abbey. In addition, there is a yearly program of weekly teachings as well as various teaching and meditation retreats: * Thursday (reasoning and debate) and Friday (lamrim) night teachings, which are broadcast via livestream.com and posted on the Sravasti Abbey YouTube channel; * Annual 'Young Adults Explore Buddhism' program; * Annual 'Exploring Monastic Life' three-week residential program for those thinking about becoming a Buddhist monk or nun; * Annual month-long Winter retreat; * Various other courses and retreats, which can be found on the Sravasti Abbey events page. In addition to formal teachings and programs, an emphasis is placed on community life as a vehicle for transforming the mind and developing love and compassion for others. Community life is underpinned by living according to the vinaya, the Buddha's guidelines for community living. The Abbey also has monthly Sharing the Dharma Days that include instruction on meditation, teachings, a pot-luck vegetarian lunch, discussion group and tour of the grounds; leads weekly meditation and Dharma discussion course at the Unitarian Universalist Church of Spokane; and other events such as talks at local universities. Programs are open to monastics and the general public.  Friends of Sravasti Abbey  In keeping with the traditional interdependent relationship between lay and monastic practitioners, Friends of Sravasti Abbey (FOSA) was developed as a network of lay supporters who supply the Sangha with the four requisites: food, shelter, clothing, and medicine. FOSA has three branches: one in North America, one in Singapore, and one in Russia. In order to cultivate this interdependence, the monastics only eat the food that has been offered by lay support. Sravasti Abbey Friends Education (SAFE) Sravasti Abbey also offers an online distance education program, Sravasti Abbey Friends Education (SAFE). Each module is a 12-week set of teachings that help students to deepen their spiritual practice through Buddhist study and meditation, and strengthen their connection with Thubten Chodron and Sravasti Abbey. Each SAFE course involves: * Weekly assigned teachings in video, audio, or written formats * Weekly group discussions, facilitated online or locally if there is a SAFE group near you * Daily meditation practice * Keeping a portfolio of written reflections that facilitators give feedback on The course features teachings by the Abbey's abbess, Ven. Thubten Chodron. Videos and commentaries by her teachers are also included: the Dalai Lama, Khensur Jampa Tegchok, Kyabje Zopa Rinpoche, Geshe Sonam Rinchen, and others. Course facilitators include monastics, monastic trainees, and long-term students who have progressed through the SAFE program. Course participation requires about 3‚Äì5 hours of weekly study and at least 20 minutes of daily meditation. SAFE is offered freely.

An alumna of Kalakshetra in Madras (now Chennai) under the tutelage of Srimathi Rukmini Devi Arundale, she emigrated with her family to Singapore in 1974. In 1977 she and her husband founded the performance arts company Apsaras Arts, which has staged performances throughout the world. She was the company's artistic director and continued to teach dance. In 1983, Neila was appointed the dance instructor and choreographer for the Indian Dance Group of the People's Association (PA)‚Äîa state board in Singapore‚Äîwhere she remained a resident choreographer. She was also an artistic adviser to Singapore's National Arts Council. For her contributions to dance, Neila was awarded the Singaporean Cultural Medallion in 1989. She became a Singapore citizen in 1994. Neila's interactions with choreographers and dancers of different cultural backgrounds and traditions in Singapore inspired her to create new Indian dance steps based on classical foundations; for instance, her dance- drama Kannagi, staged for the Singapore Festival of Arts in 1998, was said to have stretched tradition to its limits and offered something to a range of audiences far wider than a traditional dance-drama would have done. Up to 2007, Neila had choreographed dance segments for the last 13 Chingay Parades, street parades held annually in Singapore as part of Chinese New Year festivities. Early life and education The second of four daughters of a well-to-do dental surgeon and a housewife,Neila's mother's name was Manonmany Balendra: Neila Balendra was born in 1938 in Colombo, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). She began dancing at the age of five, and trained in the classical Indian dance traditions of Bharatanatyam, Kathak, Kathakali and Manipuri at the Shanti Kumar School of Dance and the Kalaya School of Dance in Colombo. In 1954, she won the gold medal at the All-Ceylon Dance Festival and was selected to perform for Elizabeth II when the Queen visited Sri Lanka in April 1954 during her tour of the Commonwealth after acceding to the throne. Neila has said: \\"That was the day I decided I was going to devote my life to dance. My father wanted me to become a dental surgeon, but I refused\\". Neila Sathyalingam trained under the legendary Bharatanatyam danseuse Rukmini Devi Arundale, photographed here in 1940. At 18, she enrolled in Kalakshetra, a cultural academy located in Madras (now Chennai) which was established to preserve traditional values in Indian art and reputed to be one of the best dance institutions in India, under the tutelage of Srimathi Rukmini Devi Arundale (1904‚Äì1986). She lived a regimented lifestyle, living in a thatched house with \\"snakes above and rats running below\\" and waking at 4:30am for dance practice every day. She completed her five-year course in two years, graduating with a first-class honours diploma in Bharatanatyam in 1957. Neila met her husband, Sathyalingam Suntharalingam,According to a 20 August 2007 article in the Straits Times, Sathyalingam Suntharalingam was 78 years old in 2007: at Kalakshetra. The son of a Sri Lankan politician, C. Suntharalingam, he had graduated from the University of Madras with a Sangitha Sironmani (Degree in Music) and from Kalakshetra in 1955 with a Diploma in Music, and was then teaching Indian classical music theory and the playing of the Indian drum and cymbals at the academy. After a two-year courtship, they married in 1956 and moved back to Sri Lanka where they lived in a 40-ha farm just outside Colombo. Sathyalingam then taught dance in schools while raising her children, the first of whom was born in 1957. In May 1958, riots broke out in Sri Lanka between the Sinhalese and Tamil communities. Although the Sathyalingams received a tip-off that they had been targeted and managed to escape the violence, 80 Sinhalese rioters attacked and burned their home. Having lost their abode and all their possessions, they resettled in Colombo. In 1969 Neila returned to Kalakshetra to be trained as an instructor and to take up a postgraduate diploma course. She graduated in 1972 with a distinction and was appointed a dance teacher with Kalakshetra. Career in Singapore In 1974, Neila moved to Singapore after American company Uniroyal Chemicals,It is not known whether this company is related to the United States Rubber Company, which was renamed Uniroyal Inc. in 1961. for which her husband worked as an area sales manager, was posted there. In Singapore, Neila was exposed to dancers of different cultural backgrounds and traditions, inspiring her to create new Indian dance steps based on classical foundations. In 1977, Neila and her husband founded performing arts company Apsaras Arts under the auspices of the Kamala Club, an organisation for Indian ladies promoting Indian dance and music. Starting with 20 students, the company expanded in size and significance, and has staged numerous arangetrams (dance d√©buts) and performances in Singapore and abroad, including Australia, Apsaras Arts also toured Sydney and Canberra in 2002, and Darwin in 2003: Indonesia and Vietnam. Apsaras Arts, now based at the Telok Ayer Performing Arts Centre, took part in numerous arts and dance festivals worldwide, including the Asean Festival in Malaysia (1983); the Australian Youth Musical Festival (August 1983); the Hong Kong Arts Festival (1990); the World of Music, Arts and Dance (Womad) Festival in Singapore (2002); the 17th National Cultural Festival in Nong Khai, Thailand (2003); and the Indian Festival of Arts in Singapore (2003). Neila and her husband were respectively the company's artistic director and music director, and continued to teach classical Indian dance and music. In 1983, Neila was appointed the dance instructor and choreographer for the Indian Dance Group of the People's Association (PA), where she taught Indian dance to children from lower-income families for free. She was the resident choreographer for the Indian Dance Group, which is now under the umbrella of PA Talents. She was also an artistic adviser to the National Arts Council. Neila was awarded the Cultural Medallion for her contributions to dance in 1989. She became a Singapore citizen in 1994, her husband and children following suit in subsequent years. Also in 1994, she was honoured by Bharat Kalachar, a music and dance school in Chennai,See the official website of Bharat Kalachar . Retrieved on 24 August 2007. with the Viswa Kala Bharathi, an award given to non-resident Indian artistes who have helped to propagate Indian arts in foreign lands,See for her artistic contributions throughout the world. Together with fellow Cultural Medallion holders Som Said and Yang Choong Lian, Neila was a choreographer for the Lion City Angels, a multiracial children's dance troupe formed in 1988. The group performed in the Children's Folklore Festival in France in 1995 and the International Children's Folklore Festival in Spain in 1996. Other major achievements of Neila's include the dance-drama Kannagi, staged for the Singapore Festival of Arts in 1998, and the \\"Fire\\" segment of the performance The Rhythm of Life staged by the People's Association Cultural Troupe in November 2001; the former was said to have \\"stretched the bounds of traditions to its limits and succeeded in offering something to a range of audiences far wider than what a traditional dance-drama would have done\\".. Up to 2007, Neila had also choreographed dance segments for the last 13 Chingay Parades, which are street parades held annually in Singapore as part of Chinese New Year festivities. On 14 and 15 September 2007, Neila staged at the Victoria Theatre what has been termed her \\"last mega-production\\", an Indian epic dance drama called Sivagami written by Kalki Krishnamurthy (1899‚Äì1954), which involved 65 dancers from Apsaras Arts and from India. Thereafter, she has said that she intended to \\"slow down\\" by focusing on her teaching, although she has remarked: \\"There is really no such thing called a swan song, and I won't like to keep still after being so active. ... I will keep dancing as long as my body will say yes to me\\". Personal life Neila and her husband, Sathyalingam, had three daughters and a son. Of her daughters, her eldest, Mohana (born 1957), sings for Apsaras Arts' performances; while Nandana (born 1960), runs an Indian performing arts school also called Apsaras Arts in Canberra, Australia.

The Tudor Vladimirescu Division (full name: Romanian 1st Volunteer Infantry Division 'Tudor Vladimirescu - Debrecen' ) was a Soviet-organized division of Romanians that fought against Germany and Hungary during the final year of World War II. Creation Named after Tudor Vladimirescu, the leader of the Wallachian uprising of 1821, the division was formed from Romanian prisoners of war in October 1943,Axworthy, p. 46. under the command of Brigadier General Nicolae Cambrea.

Combat losses were heavy; by March 1945 the strength of the division had sunk to 4,436 men.Gosztony, p. 209. In March 1945 the division was pulled out of the front lines, but remained under the operational control of the 2nd Ukrainian Front until August 15, 1945. Postwar political role In late 1945 the division was reported to have been integrated into the Romanian 4th Army. Relentlessly politicized by their communist leaders, the Tudor Vladimirescu Division became a politically reliable military formation of the Romanian communists. Along with another Romanian communist unit, the Horea, Clo≈üca ≈üi Cri≈üan Division, and backed by tens of thousands of Red Army troops, the Tudor Vladimirescu Division played a key role in imposing communist rule in Romania after the war.

They launched their debut album \\"All 'Bout Smoke 'n Mirrors\\" in 2003 and achieved #1 on radio airplay with the first single \\"Melancholic Ballad\\" where it also included \\"Picture Of My Own\\" as the soundtrack of a major TV commercial and \\"How Do You Know Me\\". \\"Catharsis\\", is the second album released in 2006. Singles are \\"You're Gone\\", \\"Cause to Love You\\" (#1 radio airplay) and \\"Move Faster\\". In 2009, Fingertips released \\"Magic Heart EP\\" and single \\"Do It (Magic Colors)\\" achieved #1 radio airplay and a #1 on iTunes. They've performed in Rock in Rio Lisbon, Vilar Mouros Festival and shared the stage with Queen and Paul Rodgers, The Corrs, George Michael, Nelly Furtado and The Cure. By the end of 2009 the vocalist Z√© Manuel had departed from the band. In 2010, Fingertips set a new course and choose Joana Gomes to be the new voice of the band. They released two albums \\"Venice\\" (2011) and \\"2\\" (2012). In 2015, Fingertips traveled to Los Angeles and the city had become the epicentre of the band's inspiration when they were recording at The Ballroom Studios and East West Studios with Mark Needham (Imagine Dragons, The Killers, Fleetwood Mac). In 2018, Fingertips announced the return of Z√© Manuel to the band to celebrate the 15¬∫ anniversary and released the first single of the year \\"My Everyday\\".  History  =2002‚Äì2009: Formation and early years= It all started in March 2003 when a brand new Portuguese band delivered their debut album to the stores. That album was called \\"All 'Bout Smoke N' Mirrors\\". The band, Fingertips. The band, formed by Z√© Manuel and Rui Saraiva, began to walk their way in the modern Portuguese music scene. Nothing to chance, nothing by accident. All with intention, all for wanting. With the need to win and conquer their place in the sun. In English. For Portugal and the World! In \\"All 'Bout Smoke N' Mirrors\\", all lyrics were written by Z√© Manuel, who despite being 16 years old, already showed a very advanced poetic maturity in which he mixed, in a simple way, his melodramatic side, nostalgic, ironic and dreamy. These songs were composed by Rui Saraiva and Helder de Matos in a simple but bold way, fitting the poems perfectly. \\"All 'Bout Smoke N' Mirrors\\" was one of the biggest hits of 2003, with two of the most downloaded/listened singles on Portuguese radio stations: \\"Melancholic Ballad (For The Leftlovers)\\" and \\"How Do You Know Me\\". But not only sound made the Fingertips. The image is an important tool and the band by knowing this, bet heavily on that. Not only in the promotional photos, but also in the visual care of the videos \\"Melancholic Ballad (For The Leftlovers)\\" and 3D innovation with \\"How Do You Know Me\\". \\"Melancholic Ballad (for the Leftlovers)\\", directed by Jo√£o Costa Menezes and with the special participation of actress D√©bora Monteiro, was selected for International Festivals in Torrelavega (Spain), Leicester and London (England) and Clermont Ferrand (France). This song was responsible for all the madness that invaded the Portuguese radio and television in the year 2004: in the radio, the song reached the 1st place of the most played songs and the band won the best award for national artist on the Nova Era radio station; in television, the theme was part of the soundtrack of the telenovela \\"Celebridade\\" and made the band to be nominated for two golden globes in the categories of Best Song and Best Group. In 2004 the song \\"Picture Of My Own\\" was the theme chosen by a Portuguese beer brand to serve as a soundtrack for their new campaign. A single action that stopped all National TV channels at 22:00 in April 2004, presented the biggest advertisement (3.00 min) ever made in Portugal. During this year, Fingertips opened the first part of The Corrs concert, in the Municipal Stadium of Braga, they acted in the main stage of the Vilar de Mouros Festival. To end the year, they played the New Year with Nelly Furtado. For the rest of the year, Fingertips presented their audiences with a series of acoustic concerts under the title N 'Outros Luares, an intimate concert and sharing of emotions. On 19 January 2005, the Fingertips recorded their first live DVD, based on an acoustic concert given at nightclub ACT Porto. In July 2005, they ascend the stage in the Stadium of the Restelo opening the concert for the legendary English band Queen, in a tour with Paul Rodgers. Fingertips began the recordings of a new album released in March 2006: Catharsis (Greek word meaning explosion of feelings). Continuing along the path of the debut album, the second, and always difficult album \\"Catharsis\\" confirmed the Fingertips not as a promise of national music but as a certainty. Proof of this is the single \\"Cause To Love You\\", a ballad in the style of the Fingertips: melancholy, passionate, intense and captivating. In October 2006 and after a summer with the important participation at Rock in Rio Lisboa, the Fingertips present another single \\"Move Faster\\", in addition to the normal version the band decided to invite Nuno Nobre aka Hydro, to make a remix of the theme. Connecting the 80s to today's dance floors was the challenge that the Fingertips put to Nuno Nobre, who masterfully worked the Rock-Electro-Dance triangle and marked the remix with a mix of notable influences. May 2007 is the month chosen to release the double single \\"Outsider N¬∫ 12\\" and the ballad \\"You're Gone (Everybody Knows That)\\" as new bets for the promotion of the album \\"Catharsis\\". The reason the band decided to release this double single is that these themes were chosen among fans as their favorites. During the same month the band debuts on its official website the music of the song \\"18th March\\", recorded on the occasion of Portugal Fashion. Also in May, another Fingertips surprise of the year comes as they are invited for the opening act at George Michael's debut concert in Portugal. 2008 is the year of the first Fingertips live album: \\"Live ACT\\" that comes as the fulfillment of a promise, by bringing the live record of the unforgettable Christmas concert the band held on 21 December 2007 at ACT Porto. It was a unique event, materialized in support of the group to the Portuguese Association of Missing Children, for which it reversed part of the revenues. From revelation in 2003, the Fingertips had become, once and for all, one of the most interesting and fundamental Portuguese groups, anchored in the voice and poetry of Z√© Manuel, showing in all their fullness in this concert captured live, under the title \\"Live ACT\\". 2009 marks the return of Fingertips to the creation of new themes and musical charts. \\"Do It (Magic Colors)\\", accelerates the rotation in Portuguese radio stations and in April 2009 reached the 1st place on national airplay and 1st place on iTunes. But 2009 was a turbulent year, after the first places hit, singer Z√© Manuel announces to the press in November his departure from the Fingertips. =2010‚Äì2017: A New Voice= In 2010, the Fingertips led by their lead composer Rui Saraiva decided to take a new turn. The need for a new voice, new sounds, a new image and attitude that complemented the group was emerging and they went in search of that voice. On 24 February 2010, from the partnership between LG Electronics, RFM (one of the most heard Portuguese radios) and the Fingertips launched an unprecedented contest. The objective was to find the vocalist of the band, led by Rui Saraiva. The RFM / LG Challenge toured eight cities in the country in the first phase, with a set of hearings for the candidates who signed up for the competition. On 8 May 2010, the final with 6 finalists was held in S√£o Pedro do Sul, Viseu district, with Joana Gomes becoming the new voice of the Fingertips. With the arrival of Joana, the band finalized some ideas they had in the studio and released the advance single \\"Simple Words\\", their first song recorded with Joana Gomes. \\"Simple Words\\" puts the new melodic and intense sound of the band on the horizon. A ballad with the sweet and sensual voice of Joan, where you can listen to a melodic piano. The guitar solo brings back memories of past decades and delicate cuts with passion, in an individual and intense chorus. Composed by producers Rui Saraiva and Helder de Matos and marks the arrival of lyricist Virg√≠lio Fino, a Londoner with big Portuguese roots. On 30 May 2010, the Fingertips took the stage at Rock in Rio Lisbon with the new vocalist Joana. In the concert, two special guests participated: the guitarist Alexandre Almeida and the Brazilian musician/singer Z√© Ricardo, who performed the first single from the band \\"Simple Words\\" as a duet. Between months in studio and concerts in Portugal, the album \\"Venice\\" was released worldwide on the music market in March 2011. The Fingertips presented the work \\"Venice\\" with a special concert during Portugal Fashion 2011, with an image created by the designer J√∫lio Torcato, (friend of the band for many years) because Portugal Fashion is a place of fashion, and because fashion it is also what you hear. \\"Venice\\" includes the singles \\"Simple Words\\", \\"Thinking About You\\" and \\"Dreaming of the Moon\\". The song \\"Dreaming of the Moon\\" was remixed by DJ Pete Tha Zouk. The energy and spirit of the elements of the band made them inspired and there was still a lot of material to work on. The ideas were more and the need to put them in the studio was the main thought of the band. After six months in the studio, the album \\"2\\" arrives to the public on 5 March 2012. The album \\"2\\", the band's second album with Joana, means the duality that exists daily: right and wrong, night and day, white and black, silence and noise. Where music is emotion, communication and relationship. \\"Running Out of Time\\" was the first single from the album \\"2\\" and showed us that in our day and age we live against time, that it passes through us without realizing it and that sometimes we need to stop, calm down and let it go with the flow. A theme that reflects well the band's daily life and the stage that they went through, between work, stress and without being able to stop and have quiet moments. Basically, living against the time that insists on passing quickly. The band started a tour in Portugal by visiting more than 20 cities, from March 2012 to September 2012. Each concert in each city demonstrates a history, the history of the band, the history of life and the history of each of us. The strenuous energy and liveliness experienced in each concert is shown on the attitude of the band, who don't want to make music for the masses, but rather Music in its true sense and suitable to all those who have gotten used to listening to the great hits of this band with quality and good taste. This tour was supported by RFM radio station, SIC television and partners PT/TMN, MusicBox, Tiffosi and Terras do Demo. Fingertips is music, is communication, is emotion and much more than that. The solidarity aspect associated with music is a social commitment that the band defies and leads to know several institutions/foundations throughout their tour \\"2\\". Fingertips showed that music and solidarity can and should be united, helping those who need it most. To this end, they created the solidarity ticket, which consists of a discount of the ticket for the concert for people who bring a food package that will be reverted to the aided institutions. Caritas, Red Cross, Acreditar, Bank food against hunger among many others were the institutions included in this \\"2\\" tour. In October 2012 the Fingertips made their first appearance in Asia with several concerts in Shanghai and Hangzhou. In 2013 the Fingertips inspired by their Asia experience begin to prepare a new path for the international promotion of their music. They develop a new creative work in their studio and receive the support of Safta Jaffery (Muse, Stone Roses, Coldplay, Radiohead) and Ron Saint Germain (Jimi Hendrix, U2, Michael Jackson, Red Hot Chili Peppers, etc.). They are invited to create the official song of Eurogym 2013. The song \\"Let's Share\\" was presented at the presentation ceremony of the Stadium in Coimbra. In 2014 the Fingertips began the international promotion with concerts in Brazil (S√£o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro) and in China at the West Bund Music Festival. In 2015 they travel to Los Angeles to record new original material with producer Mark Needham (The Killers, Imagine Dragons, Fleetwood Mac, Moby, etc.). Meanwhile, the international promotion continues with showcases in Los Angeles, Toronto, Brighton, Amsterdam, Singapore, Sydney, Tokyo, Shanghai, Berlin and other cities. Still in the year of 2015 they publish the single \\"Out of Control\\", produced and mixed by Mark Needham in The Ballroom in Hollywood. Many international radio airplay singles are featured (KROQ Los Angeles, CA), (KNDD Seattle, WA), (WRUR Rochester, NY), (KKDO Sacramento, CA), (Triple MMM, Australia) among many others. They return to Shanghai to film the video of the single \\"Out of Control\\" with director Vasco Mendes. In 2016 they began a trip through Europe, passing through Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam, Hamburg, Berlin where they film a video documentary under the direction of director Vasco Mendes. They return to Hollywood in April to record with Mark Needham the single \\"Kiss Me\\" and invited the director Vasco Mendes to produce the new video, taking advantage of the landscapes of Hollywood, Santa Monica and Venice Beach. Still in 2016 the Fingertips presented at the Casa da M√∫sica in Porto a concert to the Portuguese audience that mirrors the creative work they have developed in recent months. In the year 2017 they edited the single \\"Somebody New\\" and chosen their hometown Viseu to film the official video. =2018-present: Return of Z√© Manuel= 2018 arrives as a year that promises to be very special to the fans. In celebration of the 15th anniversary of the release of the 1st album \\"All'Bout Smoke 'n Mirrors\\", the Fingertips announced the return of Z√© Manuel to participate in these celebrations.

The purpose was to prevent citizens of the Eastern Bloc escaping to the West, although official reports stated it was to keep the enemy's spies and saboteurs out of Czechoslovakia. The border system of Czechoslovakia was not as elaborate and fortified as that of the Inner German border or the Berlin Wall, but it was considered difficult to cross the border undetected.  History and development  Part of the former \\"iron curtain\\" in Dev√≠nska Nov√° Ves, Bratislava After World War II and liberation of country the original borders of Czechoslovakia were restored and special units of police (SNB) were to protect the borders together with the army. Following the Communist takeover in the government, thousands of opponents of the communist regime tried to escape the country. For individuals or small groups it was quite easy to avoid the guards and cross the borders, though it was dangerous if they were spotted, as the guards were allowed to shoot the intruders on sight. About 10,000 people including 50 prominent politicians crossed the borders in the first year after the political change. Consequently, the independent HQ of Border Guard was created but the number of crew was nearly the same (about 6,000 men) as the detection of potential emigrants by regular police was preferred. The so-called \\"forbidden zone\\" was established up to from the border in which no civilians could reside. A wider region, so called \\"border zone\\" also existed, up to from the border, in which no \\"disloyal\\" or \\"suspect\\" civilians could reside or work. For example, the entire A≈°-Bulge creating the most problematic part of the border territory fell within the border zone. Substantial changes occurred by the end of 1951, after several successful attempts of mass-escape. The number of men increased to 17,000. The Border Guard was reorganised into two brigades with headquarters in Cheb and Znojmo. Finally, the real iron containment by means of engineer equipment was built. From 1951 onwards, this area was designated by a signal fence some kilometres inside the border, while the border itself was secured by a guarded strip with a single barbed wire fence. This fence, originally an electric fence with a voltage of 5000 V, was replaced starting in 1968 by a double wire mesh fence similar to that used on the Inner German border. In addition, the border was fitted with watch towers. In contrast with the concrete towers used in East Germany, these towers were usually made of wood or steel framework. In some areas various types of land mines were used, notably PP Mi-Ba, PP Mi-D, and PP Mi. The barrier typically lay around inside the actual boundary line. As the fence was not visible from there at some places, it repeatedly occurred that curious or careless West German strollers overlooked border markers and mistakenly entered Czechoslovak territory, which could lead to their arrest. Czechoslovakia witnessed the drama at the West German embassy in Prague, where thousands of East Germans were hiding. This wore down the patience of the Czechoslovak authorities, who eventually gave in, letting all East Germans travel directly to West Germany from 3 November 1989, thus breaking the Iron Curtain. On 17 November 1989, the Velvet Revolution succeeded. The barbed wire on the borders with East Germany and Austria was removed from 5 December onwards, and from 11 December the Czechoslovak fortifications on the West German border were dismantled. The Czech Republic, Slovakia, Germany, and Austria are now all part of the Schengen Agreement, which allows border crossing without identity checks.

It was the scene of one of West Virginia's most important battles during the American Civil War--the Battle of Droop Mountain. Droop Mountain, rising 3597 feet above sea level, is located southwest of Hillsboro, West Virginia, on U.S. Route 219. During the Civil War, it formed a barrier to north-south passage along the west bank of the Greenbrier River, blocking troop movements. A determined Union attack on November 6, 1863, successfully drove off Confederate defenders, essentially ending Confederate resistance in West Virginia. Much of the mountain is now part of Droop Mountain Battlefield State Park, encompassing the preserved Civil War battlefield. The mountain is also home to the unincorporated town of Droop, West Virginia. The mountain most likely was so named on account of its \\"drooping\\" outline.

Buchanan; and commissioned 1 February 1945, Lieutenant G. F. Vietor, USNR, in command. Service history =World War II Pacific Theatre operations= Charlevoix, cargo laden, cleared Gulfport, Mississippi, 24 February 1945 for Manus, arriving 5 April. Here she was assigned to a convoy bound for the Philippines, and after a passage marked by one possible submarine contact depth charged by the convoy's escorts, reached Subic Bay 24 April to discharge her cargo. Returning to Manus 1 June, she quickly reloaded, and took departure 7 June, for Samar, Philippine Islands, where she unloaded on 28 June, returning to Manus 5 July. Next underway 11 July 1945, Charlevoix loaded aviation gas at Lae for the New Zealand Air Force based on New Britain. She delivered her flammable cargo safely 20 July, supporting our Allies in their twice-daily raids on the Japanese at by-passed Rabaul. She made one more voyage from Manus, to deliver cargo to Hollandia, returning with rolling stock for repair at Manus in August, then sailed north to Samar and Subic Bay, where she was briefly overhauled in October. =Post-war decommissioning= She then proceeded to Norfolk, Virginia, which she reached 23 December, decommissioned there 18 January 1946, and was returned to the Maritime Commission 25 January 1946. Merchant service Charlevoix was purchased for a Norwegian shipper 7 February 1947, by D/S A/S Imica. She was transferred 26 February 1947 and renamed Benny. In 1959 her name was changed to Benny Viking before changing back to Benny and then Stella Oceanica in 1963. In 1965 she was sold and reflagged in Panama, being renamed Jasolinan. However, she was sold later that year and this time renamed Paraskevi. She was finally scrapped in Spain in 1970.

Howard. Gordon was a Texan gunfighter from El Paso who had travelled the world and settled in Afghanistan. He is known in Asia for his exploits in that continent. The character was originally created when Howard was only ten years old but he did not see print until \\"The Daughter of Erlik Khan\\" in the December 1934 issue of Top-Notch. He is likely to have been inspired by real people such as Richard Francis Burton, John Nicholson, \\"Chinese\\" Gordon and Lawrence of Arabia as well as the fiction of Talbot Mundy.A Short Biography of Rober E. Howard , retrieved 21 August 2007 One of the earliest surviving stories where he made an appearance was a story written by Howard when he was sixteen years old. These stories, however, were not complete and the character itself faded from the author's consciousness for several years. He was revived in 1933 together with another oriental adventurer, Kirby O'Donnell in stories published by Top-Notch, Complete Stories and Thrilling Adventures. Although Howard is best known for his fantasy fiction, the El Borak stories are straight adventure fiction and only \\"Three-Bladed Doom\\" contains a fantasy element. The background of the El Borak stories is similar to that of the Conan the Barbarian story \\"The People of the Black Circle\\" in which Conan is a chieftain of a hill tribe in what corresponds to Afghanistan. Character introduction El Borak is the central character of the series, frequently attempting to minimise tribal wars and conflict in the region through guile or direct violence. Explanation of the character's name El Borak is Arabic for \\"The Swift\\". It is the name given to him in Afghanistan due to his speed and quickness (similar to Buraq, the swift flying steed who carried the Prophet Muhamad). This name is said to be whispered with awe, reverence and fear in Afghanistan particularly by those \\"who would by force or guile take what was not rightfully theirs.\\" This is most often represented as his speed in drawing his pistol or attacks with another weapon but can also represent his mental agility as well. Both are the defining traits of the character.  Appearance  El Borak is described as shorter than other characters and he has a slender figure. Nevertheless, he is described as \\"compact\\" and quite strong. His defining physical ability, however, is the quickness that inspired his pseudonym. El Borak describes his ancestry as Highland Scot and Black Irish, he has black hair but has black eyes instead of the blue typical of the Black Irish.  Stories  Only five El Borak stories were published during Howard's life. The remainder have been printed in the years since his suicide by various publishers. = Published during Howard's life = * \\"The Daughter of Erlik Khan\\" ‚Äî First published in Top-Notch, December 1934.

His body of work includes films like The Onion Field, Taps, The Boost, Sea of Love, Malice, City Hall and Mercury Rising. Biography Early life Becker was born on September 25, 1928 in The Bronx, New York City. His father, who had emigrated from Russia as a boy, worked as a tailor following his service in the U.S. Calvary during World War I. His mother, also a Russian immigrant, was a homemaker. Becker was the second of three children, and their only son. From his earliest memories, he had always wanted to be an artist, and exhibited a talent for drawing at an early age. After high school, Becker attended the Pratt Institute to study Fine Art, but his education wasn‚Äôt limited to school alone. Post-war New York had replaced Paris as the capital of the art world. It was home of the international avant-garde, and the birthplace of an emerging movement, later known as Abstract Expressionism, which would revolutionize Western art. This was a stimulating environment for young artists like Becker. He was part of a generation of young New Yorkers who, in the coming decades, would be at the center of American art, photography, and design. Graduating with a degree in Fine Art in 1949, he briefly taught school before finding work as a freelance illustrator. Many of his earliest jobs were designing book jackets and magazine covers for such luminaries as Herb Lubalin, Gene Frederico, Lou Dorfsman, Art Kane, and Henry Wolf at Esquire. His work caught the attention of New York fashion photographer Jerry Plucer- Sarna, who paired Becker with experienced assistant, and gave him access to his studio and equipment. It was an invaluable experience, and changed the trajectory of his career. After remaining with Plucer-Sarna for two years, he felt sufficiently skilled and confident to strike out on his own. Becker quickly made a name for himself as both a commercial and editorial photographer. His Madison Avenue clients included Young & Rubicam, Doyle Dane, Bernbach, Ogilvy, Benson & Mather, and BBDO. where he would meet, and befriend, a very young Jerry Bruckheimer. It was during this period that Becker also began making short, experimental films that played at the city‚Äôs art house theaters. The art houses were the main venues for the new European cinema that was causing a sensation with post-war audiences for its realism and dramatic intensity. Films by Italian neorealists such as Roberto Rossellini, Vittorio De Sica, Luchino Visconti, and later, Pier Paolo Pasolini, had a powerful impact upon Becker as a young man and would later inform his mature film work. Despite this growing interest film, Becker had yet to consider it as a career. But the shorts did pave the way for his later documentary work, as well as help him prepare for his next move into the emerging field of television commercials. His first jobs in commercial production were as a ‚Äúlighting consultant.‚Äù In television‚Äôs early years, there were as yet no established commercial directors; the commercials were often helmed by industrial filmmakers with little experience in advertising. Initially, Becker was brought in to help add polish and a sense of visual design to their work. But it quickly became apparent to the agencies that the young photographers who shot their print ads, people like Becker and his friend Howard Zieff, were in fact a much better fit for the new medium. In these early days of commercial production, there was still considerable creative freedom and room for experiment-ation. Becker used this opportunity to further develop his filmmaking skills, directing dozens of commercials each year. By the early 1960s, he was at the top of the profession, shooting commercials for Volkswagen, General Motors, Pepsi-Cola, Revlon, and winning the first of many subsequent Clio Awards. Throughout the 1960‚Äôs, Becker alternated between making commercials and the cin√©ma v√©rit√©-style documentaries Blind Gary Davis, Sighet, Sighet, and Ivanhoe Donaldson, which won the Gold Prize for short film at the Mannheim-Heidelberg International Film Festival. His commercial work often took him to England, which was in the midst of a social and cultural revolution. London, its epicenter, was exploding with creativity in music, fashion, and art. It was here that Becker decided to make his first feature film. Filmography = Feature films = *The Ragman's Daughter (1972) - also producer *The Onion Field (1979) *The Black Marble (1980) *Taps (1981) *Vision Quest (1985) *The Big Town (1987) *The Boost (1988) - also co-executive producer *Sea of Love (1989) *Malice (1993) - also producer *City Hall (1996) - also producer *Mercury Rising (1998) *Domestic Disturbance (2001) - also producer *Vengeance: A Love Story (2017) - executive producer only The Ragman‚Äôs Daughter (1972) Becker was living and working in England when he came across Alan Sillitoe‚Äôs novella The Ragman‚Äôs Daughter. Becker optioned the rights and hired Sillitoe to adapt the story into a screenplay. Produced in 1972, the film is a working-class drama about the daughter of a wealthy scrap merchant, who defies the rules of bourgeois society by venturing into a life of crime. The film was Victoria Tennant‚Äôs screen debut, and the first of Becker‚Äôs four collaborations with cinematographer Michael Seresin. The Ragman's Daughter would go onto win the Giovanni award for ‚ÄúBest First Feature‚Äù at the Venice Film Festival. Becker was in the middle of planning his next film, an adaptation of Jean Rhys' After Leaving Mr. Mackenzie starring Susannah York, when Britain went into recession and the domestic film market collapsed. It would be six more years before he got the opportunity to direct another feature. The Onion Field (1979) Becker‚Äôs breakthrough film was The Onion Field, based on Joseph Wambaugh‚Äôs best-selling account of the fatal kidnapping of two Los Angeles police detectives in 1963. It was the third of his books to be adapted for the screen. Unhappy with the two earlier efforts, Wambaugh made the decision to produce The Onion Field himself, and offered the film to Becker to direct. Initially, Becker was not entirely sure if the project was right for him. However, any misgivings he may have had were quickly dispelled by Joseph Wambaugh‚Äôs great passion for the project. He was, he said, ‚Äòput on this Earth to write The Onion Field.' And with that, Becker committed to the film that would establish his career as a director in Hollywood. The Onion Field also helped launch the careers of Ted Danson, Franklyn Seales, and James Woods, who received Best Supporting Actor nominations from both the New York Film Critics Circle and the National Society of Film Critics, as well as a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor. The Black Marble (1980) Becker and Joseph Wambaugh‚Äôs next collaboration was The Black Marble (1980), an off-beat black comedy about an alcoholic police detective having a mid-life crisis (Robert Foxworth), his high-strung partner (Paula Prentiss), and a cash-strapped veterinarian (Harry Dean Stanton), who stages a dog-napping to pay off gambling debts. While receiving some of the best reviews of Becker‚Äôs career, The Black Marble did not meet with the same success as The Onion Field. Over the years, however, it has become something cult film, as well as a personal favorite of director Quentin Tarantino, who owns a personal copy of it. Taps (1981) In 1981, Becker directed Timothy Hutton, Sean Penn, Tom Cruise and George C. Scott in Taps, a tense, Darryl Ponicsan-scripted drama about young military cadets who take over their academy when they discover it is to be shuttered and sold to developers. The film was Hutton‚Äôs first since receiving an Academy Award for Ordinary People. Taps also marked the feature film debuts of both Sean Penn and Tom Cruise. Originally, Cruise had been cast as an extra, but Becker was so impressed by his talent, and the intensity he brought to the rehearsals, that he offered the untried actor a leading role in the film. Vision Quest (1985) Following the success of Taps, where he demonstrated his skill working with young actors, Becker was hired to direct Vision Quest, a coming-of-age drama based on Terry Davis‚Äô 1979 novel. Matthew Modine stars as a Spokane, Washington high school student, who is training for the state wrestling championship while he pursues a relationship with an older woman, played by Linda Fiorentino in her professional debut. The film is also notable for being Madonna‚Äôs first appearance in a major motion picture. She plays a singer at a local nightclub, and performs the songs \\"Gambler‚Äù and ‚ÄùCrazy for You,‚Äù both of which were commissioned specifically for the film. Though still not widely known to the public when she was initially signed, Madonna‚Äôs career was in full flight by the time of the film‚Äôs release in 1985. To capitalize on her sudden fame, a number of foreign distributors changed the film‚Äôs title to Crazy for You. Costumes for the film, including Madonna‚Äôs fad-setting headband, were designed by Susan Becker, the director‚Äôs wife, who would later serve as costume designer on such films as St. Elmo's Fire, The Lost Boys, Days of Thunder, Flatliners, Father of the Bride, and True Romance. The Boost (1988) - also co- executive producer Nearly a decade after they made The Onion Field, Becker and actor James Woods re-united to make The Boost (1988). Set in the boom economy of the Reagan Era, the film is an unflinching look at cocaine addiction, American materialism, and the destruction they wreak. In his review for the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert described it as ‚Äúa modern day Death of a Salesman.\\" Sea of Love (1989) Sea of Love (1989) is both a thriller and dark love story. Becker felt that it was the love story, in fact, ‚Äòthat made the film work.‚Äô The chemistry between stars Al Pacino and Ellen Barkin is palpable, and Sea of Love went on to become one of the year‚Äôs biggest hits. Returning to the screen after a four year absence, Pacino earned some of his best reviews since the 1970‚Äôs, and helped to resurrect his career as a bankable star. Malice (1993) - also producer In 1993, Becker made Malice, a clever, tightly-plotted thriller starring Nicole Kidman. Bill Pullman, and Alec Baldwin as an egotistical surgeon, who when asked if he has a god complex, memorably replies, ‚Äúlet me tell you something‚Ä¶ I am God.‚Äù Aaron Sorkin's brilliant screenplay is full of sharp plot twists, character reversals, red-herrings, and other Hitchockian flourishes. The suspense is heightened further still by Jerry Goldsmith‚Äôs evocative score and Gordon Willis‚Äô moody, muted cinematography. City Hall (1996) - also producer Based on a mid-1980s bribe and kickback scandal that exposed the dark underbelly of New York City politics, City Hall (1996) remains one of Becker‚Äôs most complex and ambitious films. Becker hired Academy Award-winning screenwriter Bo Goldman to write the script. To research it, the two spent three months interviewing city officials, such as Rudolph Guiliani and former mayor Ed Koch, as well as members of the city's underworld and others familiar with intricacies of the scandal. The film boasts a stellar cast that includes John Cusack, Bridget Fonda, Danny Aiello, Martin Landau, and most notably, Al Pacino as New York‚Äôs great, but flawed mayor. Goldman‚Äôs script cuts a wide swath through the city‚Äôs power structure, revealing a landscape of compromise and corruption. Nothing is black or white. Everything is painted in ‚Äòshades of gray, full of ambiguities.‚Äô Mercury Rising (1998) Mercury Rising (1998) was brought to Becker by its star, Bruce Willis. Though ostensibly an action thriller, the project appealed to Becker because of its unusual twist on formula. Willis plays a FBI agent trying to protect a nine year old autistic savant who is being hunted down by government agents after he cracks a top secret NSA code. Wanting to depict autism in a non-exploitative manner, Becker hired a child psychiatrist from the Child Mind Institute to tutor actor Miko Hughes. Domestic Disturbance (2001) Becker‚Äôs last feature film as a director was the psychological thriller Domestic Disturbance (2001), starring John Travolta, Teri Polo, and Vince Vaughn. The film is buoyed by strong performances by Vaughn, young Matt O‚ÄôLeary, and Steve Buscemi, whose appearance in the film is comparatively brief but impactful. = Documentaries = * Eugene Atget (1963) * Blind Gary Davis (1964) *Ivanhoe Donaldson (1964) *Interview With Bruce Gordon (1964) *Sighet, Sighet (1967) Blind Gary Davis (1964) Reverend Gary Davis was a blind blues singer and guitarist, who had been living in relative obscurity in New York City until he was rediscovered in the early 1960s. In Blind Gary Davis (1964) Becker captures the legendary bluesman as he performs a pair of songs from his one room apartment. The performance is intercut with shots of his threadbare flat, as well as the surrounding Harlem neighborhood. As Becker‚Äôs camera glides through it (he was shooting through the doors of VW microbus), the locals are either indifferent, or stare back with deep suspicion. Ivanhoe Donaldson (1964) Ivanhoe Donaldson follows a young field secretary for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) as he travels below the Mason‚ÄìDixon line at the height of the tumultuous Civil Rights era. Becker‚Äôs cinema v√©rit√© camera follows Donaldson and other SNCC staffers as they organize demonstrations, voter drives and attempt to bring an end to segregation in the South. The film won Gold Prize at the Mannheim- Heidelberg International Film Festival. Interview With Bruce Gordon (1964) Simply staged and beautifully-lit, the short film features Bruce Gordon, a 22-year-old organizer for the Student Non-violent Coordinating Committee addressing issues of race and inequality in America. Shot in 1963 at SNCC headquarters in Selma, Alabama, the film premiered the following year at the Lincoln Center in New York City. Sighet, Sighet (1967) In Sighet, Sighet (1967), Nobel laureate and activist Elie Wiesel, returns to the town of Sighet, Romania, where he was born. Sighet is also where Wiesel and thousands of other Eastern European Jews were deported to the Auschwitz extermination camp three decades earlier. The modern city of Sighet presents a facade of progress and order. Becker‚Äôs camera explores a city filled with sleek buildings, sharp angles, and well-planned streets. But it is all slightly unreal. For Wiesel, the city exists only in his memory. Everyone he ever knew there, all his family and friends, are gone. The result is a haunting juxtaposition of memory and place.

C.) Herbert Ferber (1906 - 1991) was an American Abstract Expressionist, sculptor and painter, and a \\"driving force of the New York School.\\" Background Herbert Ferber Silvers was born on April 30, 1906, in New York City. In 1923, he began studies in both sciences and humanities at the College of the City of New York (now City College of New York or CCNY) from; in 1927, he received a BS from jointly from CCNY and Columbia University. In 1927, he took night classes in sculpture through 1930 at the Beaux-Arts Institute of Design (\\"affiliated in a kind of loose way with the Beaux Arts in Paris,\\" Ferber later recalled) and then studied for six months at the National Academy of Design. That summer, he that summer he was awarded a scholarship to work at The Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation in Oyster Bay, New York. In 1930, he graduated in oral and dental surgery at Columbia. Career Ferber practiced dentistry and taught part-time at the Columbia Dental School during the 1930s; he continued to sculpt and practice dentistry up through the 1950s. William Zorach and Julio Gonzales influenced Ferber (and Picasso, but Ferber himself also credited painter David McCosh: > David McCosh... who had studied at the Art Institute of Chicago, and whom I > had met at the Tiffany Foundation at Oyster Bay... began to increase my > knowledge of what art was about because here was a man who had really > studied in a good art school and who had been in Europe for a year and was a > follower of Cezanne. And he opened my eyes to a great many possibilities in > painting and sculpture which I wasn't even aware of... Through McCosh I met > some other artists... And we met some other artists who were studying at the > League and also... Theodore Roszak. In 1931, Ferber sculpted in wood and stone. In 1935, he joined New York's Midtown Galleries. In 1936, he joined the Artists Union and took part in the first American Artists' Congress. During the 1930s, his works was \\"primarily figurative and imagistic,\\" influenced in part by an interest in German expressionists as well as African and pre-Columbian sculpture. By the mid-1930s, Ferber found himself \\" very much disenchanted with the whole Communist movement.\\" In 1938, he traveled to Europe and saw Romanesque sculpture. In 1940, he joined fellow anti-Stalinist artists (Ilya Bolotowsky, Adolph Gottlieb, Mark Rothko, Meyer Schapiro, David Smith, Bradley Walker Tomlin) in forming the Federation of Modern Painters and Sculptors as a spin- off of the Communist-aligned American Artists' Congress. In 1940, Ferber changed his approach to sculpture from carving to gluing and doweling; he last worked in wood in 1944. Ferber came under the influence of Henry Moore. In 1945, Ferber began experimenting in steel-reinforced concrete, abstract sculpture, and metal-soldering. Starting in 1946, he associated with Abstract Expressionist painters, frequented Peggy Guggenheim's Art of This Century, and became more interested in Surrealism. In the 1950s, Ferber began creating \\"roofed\\" and \\"caged\\" sculpture. In 1952, Ferber completed a commission for the facade of the Congregation B'nai Israel; the result was the relief sculpture \\"Titled And the bush was not consumed.\\"Jewish art in America: an introduction, Matthew Baigell, Rowman & Littlefield, 2006, p. 108.Janay Jadine Wong, \\"Synagogue art of the 1950s: a new context for abstraction,\\" Art Journal (Winter 1994) In 1956, Ferber joined artists who protested a curvilinear slope of Frank Lloyd Wright's planned building for the Guggenheim Museum. Throughout the 1950s, Ferber lectured on and exhibited metal sculpture and site-specific sculpture. In 1961, for the Whitney Museum of American Art, he created one of the first indoor environmental installations, \\"Titled Sculpture as Environment,\\" a fiberglass piece for an entire room with interior spaces to visit. His work as a teacher included visiting professorships at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia (1962‚Äì63), and Rutgers University, New Jersey (1965‚Äì67). In the 1970s and 1980s, Ferber worked on large, abstract forms and also returned to painting as well as painted sculpture. In 1971, as guardian of Mark Rothko's daughter Kate, Ferber charged executors of the Mark Rothko estate of conspiring with the Marlborough Gallery to waste the estate's assets. An eight-month trial ended in October 1974, eventually leading to dismissal of executors and gallery, heavy fines, and appointment of Kate Rothko as executor. Remaining paintings went to her and brother Christopher Rothko; a foundation gave its share of the works to museums. Personal life and death Ferber married Sonia Stirt in 1932, Ilse Falk in 1944, and Edith Popiel in 1967, a photographer. In 1968, Ferber stated: > I became an artist because I was interested in literature particularly and > not primarily in painting and sculpture. But then, while at college, along > with my interest in literature I developed an interest in the history of > art... I never got beyond the Metropolitan and the Museum of Natural > History... [It was at] the \\"Tiffany Foundation where I met for the first > time some other artists. Herbert Ferber died age on August 20, 1991, of cancer of the bile at his summer home in Egremont, Massachusetts. Awards According to the Herbert Ferber Estate, awards to Ferber have included: * 1942: Fifth Purchase Prize, Artists for Victory exhibition, Metropolitan Museum of Art * 1943: Full member, Kappa Chapter (Columbia University), Society of Sigma Psi * 1953: Joint American prize winner, International Sculpture Competition, The Unknown Political Prisoner Monument, Institute of Contemporary Art, London * 1969: Guggenheim Fellowship * 1979: R. S. Reynolds Memorial Award for aluminum sculpture Commissions Ferber received numerous commissions for synagogues, e.g., a candelabrum and altar decoration for the chapel of Brandeis University. Other commissions include: a copper sculpture for the John F. Kennedy Office Building in Boston, an environmental sculpture for Rutgers University, and a steel sculpture for the American Dental Association Building in Chicago. According to the Herbert Ferber Estate, commissions to Ferber have included: * 1951: B'nai Israel Synagogue, Millburn, New Jersey. * 1954: Berlin Chapel, Brandeis University, Waltham, Massachusetts * 1956: Temple Aaron, St. Paul, Minnesota * 1957: Temple Anshe Chesed, Cleveland, Ohio * 1961: Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, New York * 1965: Commons Building, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, New Jersey * 1977-78: City of Ottumwa, Iowa Legacy In 1978, Ferber appeared in Masters of Modern Sculpture, Part Three, by Michael Blackwood. At his death in 1991, the New York Times said: > Mr. Ferber was one of a small group of American sculptors who in the 1940s > began to break with the traditional notion of sculpture as a solid, closed > mass. He made open, airy forms that, as he put it, \\"pierced\\" space rather > than displaced it, and he is credited with creating, in 1960, one of the > first environmental sculptures intended for people to walk through... Mr. > Ferber was also an accomplished painter, his canvases taking the form of > sculpturelike reliefs on which he painted abstract motifs.\\" In 2019, the Wall Street Journal noted: > In 1949, Clement Greenberg counted Ferber, along with Isamu Noguchi and > (David) Smith, among a handful of \\"sculptor-constructors who have a > chance... to contribute something ambitious, serious and original\\" to what > he recognized as an important \\"new genre\\" of American metal sculpture. Ferber and his wife appear in accounts of New York circles, including Writings on Art by Mark Rothko (2006) and The World in My Kitchen (2006), written by Colette Rossant, whose husband was architect and painter James Rossant. According to the Oxford Reference Dictionary: > Among the earliest artists to produce an abstract expressionist form of > sculpture, from the late 1940s he drew on constructivist and surrealist > precedents to achieve vigorous, almost gestural welded abstractions. In > time, his work evolved toward environmental sculpture, culminating during > the 1960s in room-size installations of abstract form... An observer > venturing into such a room in effect entered the sculpture. Works Herbert Ferber, Untitled, lithograph 1959, Smithsonian American Art Museum Ferber's best-known sculptures are open, hollow forms in soldered and welded metal. While abstract, their titles and spiky forms often suggest forces in conflict. ('Labors of Hercules' is an example). By the mid-1950s, he began to create, what he called, roofed sculptures‚Äïsome parts of which hung from the ceiling while other parts rose from the floor. These were followed by so-called cage works‚Äïlarge, boxy forms within which other forms were set. With , Ferber created an installation executed in fiberglass for a room at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City, opening up the interior space of the work for the viewer to enter. In the 1970s, Ferber continued his exploration of abstract form, mostly in large-scale outdoor pieces. Ferber's works have appeared the Metropolitan, the Modern, and Whitney museums in New York and in Europe. His longest-term art dealer was M. Knoedler & Co., who exhibited Ferber's last living show in September 1990.

The title character is a former Pan Am pilot who worked for the airline in its glory days. He recalls flying into a thousand sunsets and bedding eighteen Rockettes in a month, eventually marrying one of them. Now he is an aging, befuddled man lost in a world he no longer understands. Overview The serio-comic fantasy is set in an abandoned, dilapidated night club his wife Charlotte is encouraging him to buy. Peters' only interest in the place stems from its location near a shoe store that carries the extra narrow size he requires. Present are a homeless squatter named Adele (who acts as an occasional commentator) and Calvin, the owner of the property. Joining them are Larry, the shoe store proprietor who is searching for his missing wife Cathy Mae, two New Age emissaries - a young pregnant girl named Rose (who might be Peters' long-lost daughter) and her musician-composer friend Leonard, and Charlotte.

In his review in the New York Times, Ben Brantley described the play as \\"a numbing experience.

Bach. The piece consists of a melody by the French Romantic composer Charles Gounod that he superimposed over an only very slightly changed version of the Prelude No. 1 in C major, BWV 846, from Book I of J. S. Bach's The Well-Tempered Clavier, published in 1722. Composition Charles Gounod. Gounod improvised the melody, and his future father-in-law Pierre- Joseph-Guillaume Zimmermann transcribed the improvisation and in 1853 made an arrangement for violin (or cello) with piano and harmonium. The same year it appeared with the words of Alphonse de Lamartine's poem Le livre de la vie (\\"The Book of Life\\"). In 1859, Jacques-L√©opold Heugel published a version with the familiar Latin text. The version of Bach's prelude used by Gounod includes the \\"Schwencke measure\\" (m.23), a measure allegedly added by Christian Friedrich Gottlieb Schwencke in an attempt to correct what he or someone else erroneously deemed a \\"faulty\\" progression, even though this sort of progression was standard in Bach's music. Alongside Schubert's Ave Maria, the Bach/Gounod Ave Maria has become a fixture at funerals, wedding Masses, and quincea√±eras. There are many different instrumental arrangements including for violin and guitar, string quartet, piano solo, cello, and even trombones. Opera singers, such as Nellie Melba, Franco Corelli and Luciano Pavarotti, as well as choirs have recorded it hundreds of times during the twentieth century. Later in his career, Gounod composed an unrelated setting of Ave Maria for a four-part SATB choir.  Interpretations  Alessandro Moreschi, one of the last castrato singers, performed Ave Maria and several other pieces of music on recordings for the Gramophone & Typewriter Company in the early 1900s. A rendition by Yo-Yo Ma and Bobby McFerrin was used as the main theme in the 2017 Palme d'Or winning Swedish film The Square.

In addition to water service, responsibilities include sewage collection, water desalination and water recycling. EMWD also sells to eight other water agencies, which in turn, serve their own customers. They are Elsinore Valley MWD, Western MWD of Riverside County, Lake Hemet MWD, City of Perris, City of Hemet, Nuevo Water Company, City of San Jacinto, and Rancho California Water District. The EMWD's Main Office and Operations and Maintenance Center are located at 2270 Trumble Road in Perris. History Since its formation in 1950, Eastern Municipal Water District (EMWD) has changed from a small, primarily agricultural-serving agency, to one whose major demands come from domestic customers. Authorized under the Municipal Water District Act of 1911, EMWD's duties and responsibilities are further delineated in the California Water Code. In 1951, EMWD annexed to The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWD). EMWD employs approximately 614 employees.  Facilities  EMWD owns and operates more than 2,500 miles of potable water pipeline throughout its service area. EMWD has 79 potable (drinking) water storage tanks, 86 active pumping plants, 14 active domestic wells and 12 brackish (desalter) wells. EMWD owns and operates potable (drinking) water filtration plants in Hemet and Perris. It has two reverse osmosis groundwater desalination facilities in Menifee and is designing a third groundwater desalination facility. EMWD also owns and operates four Regional Water Reclamation Facilities (RWRF) located in Perris, Moreno Valley, Temecula and San Jacinto. It treats 46 million US gallons of wastewater each day from more than 246,000 wastewater (sewer) connections. EMWD converts that wastewater to tertiary-treated recycled water, which is then used to irrigate landscapes for sports fields, medians, golf courses, parks, schools, restricted recreational use and more.  Water supply sources EMWD receives its water supplies from a mix of local and imported sources. Imported water is purchased through the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, which includes the State Water Project and Colorado River Aqueduct as primary sources. As of June 30, 2018, imported water accounted for approximately 51 percent of EMWD's overall water supply portfolio. EMWD also relies heavily on local groundwater from the San Jacinto Groundwater Basin. Ten percent of EMWD's overall demands are met through groundwater production and another five percent are met through groundwater desalination efforts. EMWD currently operates two groundwater desalination facilities in Menifee, which treats brackish (salty) groundwater through reverse osmosis. Recycled water makes up about 34 percent of EMWD's overall water supply portfolio. This water is used for irrigation of crops, schools, parks, golf courses, streetscapes and industrial uses. EMWD uses 100 percent of its recycled water for beneficial reuse and is one of the nation's leaders in recycled water. EMWD has been recognized by the WateReuse Foundation and other professional organizations for its expansive use of recycled water. EMWD Board of Directors EMWD‚Äôs five-member board of directors comprise the governing body of EMWD. The EMWD Board of Directors are responsible to the members of the public of their respective division, and to the general public within the EMWD service area, for proper conduct of EMWD affairs. Directors are elected to four-year terms by the registered voters in five geographic divisions. These divisions are apportioned by population. Terms are staggered to ensure continuity, with public elections held in at least two divisions every two years. Directors must reside within their elected division. Terms are staggered to ensure continuity with public elections held in at least two divisions every two years. The current Board of Directors is made up of Philip E. Paule (District 1); Stephen J. Corona (District 2); Randy A. Record (District 3); Ronald W. Sullivan (District 4); and David J. Slawson (District 5). Director Record sits on the Board for The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWD).  Service area EMWD's 555-square-mile service area includes all or portions of the cities of Moreno Valley, Hemet, Perris, San Jacinto, Menifee, Perris, Murrieta, Temecula, and Canyon Lake. It also includes the unincorporated communities of Mead Valley, Good Hope, Romoland, Homeland, Winchester, French Valley, Valle Vista, and Diamond Valley. The population within the current service area is about 827,000. EMWD provides service to about 150,000 domestic water accounts, 116 agricultural accounts, 246,000 wastewater accounts and 511 recycled water accounts. EMWD is California's sixth-largest retail water agency, serving roughly 34 percent of Riverside County's population.

Biography Boleslaus E. Goral was born in Koenigsdorf, West Prussia on March 12, 1876. He immigrated to the U.S. in 1889 and attended SS. Cyril and Methodius Seminary in Detroit, Michigan and St. Francis Seminary near Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Father Goral was ordained on June 18, 1899 and, as a skilled linguist, originally served as a professor at the seminary. He spoke fluent Polish, German, Latin, and Greek. He wrote a book on punctuation in the Polish language as well as an article on Charles Antoniewicz for the Catholic Encyclopedia.Goral, Boleslaus. \\"Charles Antoniewicz.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 1. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 11 June 2019 At this time, a bitter conflict was taking place between the Milwaukee Archdiocese and the Polish language Kuryer Polski daily newspaper which was advocating an ethnic Polish Bishop for the city. In 1906, Father Goral was named to head up the Nowiny Polskie,University of Wisconsin- Milwaukee, Roman B.J. Kwasniewski, Papers, 1892-1953. an alternative to the Kuryer which would have an editorial stance more sympathetic to the official positions of the Archdiocese. While Archbishop Sebastian Messmer denied direct involvement with the start up of Nowiny, it was felt by many that the paper was simply a mouthpiece for the official position of the Archdiocese. Following a rather slow start, Father Goral became concerned about the viability of the new paper and asked Archbishop Messmer for more open support from the church hierarchy. Messmer sent a letter to the Milwaukee clergy saying that support for the paper was ‚Äúabsolutely necessary‚Äù and asked them to solicit subscriptions from the pulpit. Letters published in Nowiny from the Archdiocese made it clear that the Church in Milwaukee fully supported the paper and official endorsements came even from Pope Pius X in Rome. Nowiny‚Äôs circulation eventually attracted enough readers to become a daily in 1907,The Catholic Encyclopedia and Its Makers, 1917, p. 68 and an effective counterpoint to the Kuryer. The conflict between the two Polish papers became increasingly bitter and very personal. Father Goral's personal morals were attacked by the Kuryer and the stress on him became unbearable. In 1908, in a controversial move, Father Goral was assigned as pastor at St. Vincent de Paul parish on Mitchell St. Fr. Goral had complained that his health had suffered during the press ‚Äúwar‚Äù between the Nowiny and the Kuryer. Father Goral stayed at St. Vincent but one year, and was then transferred to St. Hyacinth. Discord within this parish had previously required the transfer of Father Hyacinth Gulski from St. Hyacinth, which he had founded, to St. Hedwig's parish on Milwaukee's east side. Financial irregularities at Hyacinth had caused a major rift between parishioners and the financial administrators for the parish. Goral stilled the troubled waters at St. Hyacinth and brought the rival factions together. His mixture of kindness tempered with firmness became known as ‚ÄúJackowo gora‚Äù (St. Hyacinth on top). Fr. Goral would eventually become a member of the board of directors of St. Francis Seminary. He would remain as pastor of St. Hyacinth until his death in 1960. He was awarded the title of Right Reverend Monsignor in 1921.

The government of Indonesia and the state government of Sarawak have formally banned the export of this species. Illegal smuggling continues to be a major problem. Eusideroxylon zwageri grows in lowland primary and secondary forest up to 625m altitude.View crop. fao.org It prefers well-drained soils, sandy to clay-loam, sometimes limestone. It is commonly found along rivers and adjacent hills. It requires an average annual rainfall of 2,500‚Äì4,000 mm. It occurs scattered or in groups. This very important tree is one of the most durable and heaviest timbers in the world. It is now threatened by over-exploitation, lack of regeneration and difficulties in cultivation. Description Eusideroxylon zwageri is a slow growing (0.5 metres per year) tall evergreen tree with a straight bole (usually host to Cassytha, a parasitic vine with leaves reduced to scales, up to half of the tree's height). It is slightly fluted at the base, up to 150‚Äì220 cm in diameter. The trunk has many small, rounded buttresses that give the base an elephant-foot like appearance. Individual trees may reach an age of 1,000 years or more. Common commercially exploitable trees attain a height of 30 or more metres (100 ft) with trunk diameters of exploitable trees up to 92 cm (36 inches). Protected trees are towering giants of the forest attaining a height of up to 50 metres and a diameter of 220 cm ‚Äì though height is routinely reduced by lightning strikes.Kartasubrata, J.

Research policy for community forestry in the Asia-Pacific region. pp. 227-236. Proceedings of a seminar. Bangkok, RECOFTC. An Ulin tree discovered in 1993 in Kutai National Park, is one of the largest plants in Indonesia. It is an estimated 1,000 years old, and has increased its diameter from 2.41 to 2.47 metres in the 20 years since its discovery. Its height was however reduced from some 30 metres to only 20 after a lightning strike. Another at Sangkimah in the west of the park has a diameter of 2.25 metres and a height of some 45 metres. The trees' leaves are dark green, simple, leathery, elliptical to ovate, 14‚Äì18 cm long (5.5‚Äì7.5 inches) and 5‚Äì11 cm wide (2‚Äì4 inches), and are alternate, rarely whorled or opposite, without stipules and petiolate. The leaf blade is entire (unlobed or lobed in Sassafras) and occasionally with domatia (crevices or hollows serving as lodging for mites) in axils of main lateral veins (present in Cinnamomum). The inflorescences which are in the axils of leaves or deciduous bracts, include panicles (rarely heads), racemes, compound cymes, or pseudoumbels (spikes in Cassytha), and are sometimes enclosed by decussate bracts. The flowers are bisexual only or staminate and bisexual on some plants, pistillate and bisexual on others. The flowers are usually yellow to greenish or white, rarely reddish. The hypanthium are well- developed, resembling calyx tube tepals and the stamens perigynous. The tepals are in groups of 6 to 9, in 2 or 3 whorls of 3 and sepaloid. If tepals are unequal will then usually possess 3 outer smaller rather than inner 3. This is occasionally absent in Litsea. The stamens are in multiples and whorls of 3, but 1 or more whorls are frequently staminodial or absent. The stamens of the third whorl has 2 glands near its base. These are 2‚Äì4 locular, with locules opening by valves. There is one pistil and one carpel. There is a one locular ovary with a basal placentation; one ovule; a subsessile stigma, which is discoid or capitate. The fruit are drupes, a drupe borne on a pedicel with or without persistent tepals at its base, or is seated in a deeply cup-shaped receptacle (cupule), or is enclosed in an accrescent floral tube. The fruit contains one seed without an endosperm. The fruit are poisonous to humans but have medicinal properties. The parasite vine, Cassytha is sometimes placed in its own family, Cassythaceae. Habitat Eusideroxylon zwageri seedlings require some shade, while older trees need plenty of light. It can be found in valleys and on hillsides and even on low ridges when soil moisture is sufficient at elevations between sea level and 625 m. The standing timber volume of trees with a diameter of over 50 cm may be as much as 90‚Äì112 m3. Silviculture Eusideroxylon zwageri has a very slow growth rate of mean radial growth of 0.058 cm per year. It is a canopy species in primary forests. The species is considered unsuitable for large-scale plantations due to slow growth and inadequate seed and seedling supply. Manual selection of trees in natural forests is common.de Guzman, E.D.

Gland, Switzerland, IUCN Vessels are diffuse-porous, medium-sized and generally evenly distributed, arranged in short radial rows (2‚Äì3 vessels). Moderate abundancy of aliform paratracheal parenchyma. Growth rings boundaries are indistinct or absent. Tyloses are often present. The wood has a radial shrinkage rate of 2‚Äì4.5% and a tangential shrinkage rate of tangential 4.5‚Äì7.5%. The timber dries slowly, and care is needed to avoid checks and splits. The wood is famed for its easy working characteristics, despite high density. The wood planes, bores and turns cleanly, producing smooth and often lustrous surfaces. Nailing requires pre-bores prior to nailing. Saw blades and cutting instruments are only moderate blunted during working the timber. Apparently, the wood is difficult to glue with synthetic resins. Heartwood is rated as very durable ‚Äì immune to termite attack; service life of up to 100 years in direct soil contact and more than 20 years for marine work in tropical waters has been reported. Usage Due to the excellent resistance to bacterial, fungal, insect and marine borer attack the wood is highly prized for many outdoor uses, especially as decking. Additionally, the wood's high density and easy workability lend it to particularly desirability in maritime structures, dock construction and ship building, especially Indonesia's famous pinisi sail- boat.History of the Indonesian Pinisi. kastenmarine.co Common local uses include: House construction, door construction, water butts and troughs, boat building (Pinisi), tools, tool handles, talisman, jewellery, medicinal slivers (for wounds, cuts, abrasions, bites and tooth-ache/infection), bridges, blowpipes and spear shafts. Internationally, it is renowned for heavy construction such as a buffer between transportation trailers and heavy steel fabrications (such as boilers, pressure vessels, reactors and many others). It is also frequently found in dry docks as a timber to separate the hull of ships from the steel supporting stands. Other uses include use in boats and ships, industrial flooring, roofing (as shingles), fine indoor and outdoor furniture, coffin wood (esteemed by Chinese due to ability to withstand rot and insect attack) and tool handles (especially those exposed to continual high impact (the wood does not splinter and thus injure hands, eyes or endanger the operator on catastrophic failure) such as shovels, axes, block splitters, sledge hammers, heavy mallets, demolition hammers, mattocks, picks, hoes and hammers). Some expert cabinet-makers treasure an ulin-headed carpenter's mallet as an excellent intermediate density hammer face between the usual wood and a metal one and is able to quite easily tap or \\"whack\\" stubborn highly polished metal fixtures without damage to the face or the fixture. Other sources indicate that ulin wood is often used for marine constructions such as pilings, wharfs, docks, sluices, dams, ships, bridges, but also used for power line poles, masts, roof shingles and house posts and to a minor extent as frame, board, heavy duty flooring, railway sleepers, fencing material, furniture etc. Endangered status The decline of this species which was first noted in 1955. Browne (1955) stated: \\"Our surviving supplies of Belian are by no means very large and undoubtedly dwindling.\\" Population reduction has been noted in the following regions: Kalimantan, Sumatra, Sabah, Sarawak, and the Philippines. IUCN has categorized it Vulnerable A1cd and A2cd. CITES listed II Bi (unsustainable level of exploitation from the wild for international trade). Regeneration in logged- over forests is limited. The species is threatened by over-exploitation, predominantly by illegal migrant loggers. Current demand for the timber is fueled for its esteem among Chinese as a coffin wood (as it is resistant to insect and rot). Included in list of vanishing timber species of the Philippines and considered almost extinct in Sabah. In Java and Sumatra it exists solely in National Parks. Currently the situation is assessed as a serious depletion of stands. The species is only planted on a small scale because the supply of seeds and seedlings is inadequate. The world-famous IPB Bogor Agricultural Institute (Institut Pertanian Bogor) is currently breeding a generation of plants more hardy than the wild harvested seeds Trade Indonesia has a total prohibition on export, and cutting is restricted to trees less than 60 cm diameter measured at breast height. In Sarawak, export in any form is not allowed without special permission. Sabah still allows export. Indigenous beliefs Many Dayak believe that the ulin wood acts as a protective talisman to avoid attack from tigers and elephants. The Dayak believe that this use of the ulin talisman and the stands of ulin trees was and is the sole cause of a lack of Sumatran elephants or Sumatran tigers in Kalimantan and Sarawak. The potent 'elephant and tiger repellent' is alleged to be the sap of the tree, which has a strong, pleasant lemon-like odour.

Eusideroxylon are hardwood trees reaching up to 50 metres in height with trunks over in diameter, producing commercially valuable timber. The wood of E. zwageri (Borneo Ironwood or Belian) is impervious to termites, and can last up to 100 years after being cut. Due to extensive logging, it is listed as vulnerable in the IUCN Red List of IUCN, and conservation efforts are underway, with several countries banning imports.  Description  Eusideroxylon are canopy tree species with erect or spreading branches and extremely durable and decay-resistant wood. They are native to tropical rain forests in south-east Asia (namely Malaysia, Indonesia‚Äînotably its islands of Borneo, Java, and Sumatra‚Äîand the Philippines). The color of the flowers is pale yellow to yellow. The flower is hermaphrodite, actinomorphic, with 6 tepals, distributed in two whorls that overlap. There are six staminodes, three stamens, and a simple pistil that consists of one carpel. Pollination is done by bees and other insects. The fruits are drupes, varying in size and shape from oblong to ovate or sub-cylindrical to asymmetric elongated or rounded. They are 8‚Äì13 cm long, 4‚Äì5 cm in diameter, and weigh 90g-170g. Seed dispersal is by vertebrate animals such as birds, monkeys, bats and rodents, for which the fruits are an important food source. The thick, leathery leaves are dark green, 26‚Äì29 cm in length, with a width of 10‚Äì11 cm. Young leaves are reddish brown to yellowish red. They have a generous layer of wax, making them glossy in appearance, and are narrow, pointed oval in shape with an apical mucro, or 'drip tip', which enables the leaves to shed excess water in a humid environment. Timber segments collected from 15 logged stumps in Kubah National Park, Sarawak, Malaysia, found that E. zwageri can live more than 1000 years and that the growth rate of this species is very slow, with a mean radial growth rate of 0¬∑058 cm y-1. The cutting of old trees of E. zwageri results in the species being replaced by faster growing species. The long life span and reduced growth rate of this species may be a result of its dense and durable wood containing abundant defensive compounds.

He was a member of the Hayashi clan of Confucian scholars. Following in the footsteps of his father, Hayashi Razan, Gah≈ç (formerly Harukatsu) would devote a lifetime to expressing and disseminating the official neo-Confucian doctrine of the Tokugawa shogunate. Like his distinguished father, Gah≈ç's teaching and scholarly written work emphasized Neo-Confucianist virtues and order.Ponsonby-Fane, R. (1956). Kyoto: the Old Capital of Japan, 794-1869, p. 418. Academician Gah≈ç became the unofficial rector of what would become Edo‚Äôs Confucian Academy, the Sh≈çhei-k≈ç (afterwards known as the Yushima Seid≈ç).Nussbaum, Louis Fr√©d√©ric et al.. (2005). Japan Encyclopedia, p. 300. This institution stood at the apex of the country-wide educational and training system which was created and maintained by the Tokugawa shogunate. Gah≈ç's hereditary title was Daigaku-no-kami, which, in the context of the Tokugawa shogunate hierarchy, effectively translates as \\"head of the state university.Ponsonby-Fane, p. 418. In the elevated context his father engendered, Gah≈ç worked on editing a chronicle of Japanese emperors compiled in conformance with his father's principles. Nihon ≈ådai Ichiran grew into a seven-volume text which was completed in 1650. Gah≈ç himself was accepted as a noteworthy scholar in that period; but the potent Sh≈çhei-k≈ç and Hayashi family links to the work‚Äôs circulation are part of the explanation for this work's 18th and 19th century popularity. Contemporary readers must have found some degree of usefulness in this summary drawn from historical records. The narrative of Nihon ≈ådai Ichiran stops around 1600, most likely in deference to the sensibilities of the Tokugawa regime. Gah≈ç's text did not continue up through his present day; rather, he terminated the chronicles just before the last pre-Tokugawa ruler. Gah≈ç modestly observed that \\"in a book intended for the shogun's eyes, it is incumbent upon one to be circumspect.\\"Hoffman, Michael. \\"A man in the soul of Japan\\", Japan Times, September 10, 2006. This book was published in the mid-17th century and it was reissued in 1803, \\"perhaps because it was a necessary reference work for officials.\\"Screech, Secret Memoirs of the Shoguns: Isaac Titsingh and Japan, 1779-1822. p. 65. Gah≈ç would become his father's successor as advisor to the shogun. He was, in his lifetime, the Tokugawa shogunate's chief scholar. After Razan's death, Gah≈ç finished work his father had begun, including a number of other works designed to help readers learn from Japan's history. In 1665, Gah≈ç published an anthology of historical poems (Honch≈ç Ichinin Isshu).Keene, Donald. (1999). Travelers of a Hundred Ages, p.430. In 1670, the Hayashi family's scholarly reputation was burnished when Gah≈ç published the 310 volumes of .Brownlee, John. (1999). Political Thought in Japanese Historical Writing, p. 120 Together with his brother, Hayashi Dokk≈çsai (formerly Morikatsu), Gah≈ç compiled, edited and posthumously published selections from their father's body of writings: * Hayashi Razan bunsh≈´ (The Collected Works of Hayashi Razan), reissued in 1918 * Razan Sensei Issh≈´ (Master Razan's Poems), reissued in 1921 Gah≈ç's son, Hayashi H≈çk≈ç (formerly Nobuatsu), would eventually inherit the position as head of the Sh≈çhei-k≈ç or Yushima Seid≈ç, as well as the honorific Daigaku-no kami; and his progeny would continue the Hayashi traditions. In January 1858, it would be the hereditary Daigaku-no- kami descendant of Hayashi Razan and Hayashi Gah≈ç who would head the bakufu delegation which sought advice from the emperor in deciding how to deal with newly assertive foreign powers. This would have been the first time the Emperor's counsel was actively sought since the establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate. The most easily identified consequence of this transitional overture would be the increased numbers of messengers which were constantly streaming back and forth between Tokyo and Kyoto during the next decade. There is no small irony in the fact that this 19th-century scholar/bureaucrat would find himself at a crucial nexus of managing political change‚Äîmoving arguably \\"by the book\\" through uncharted waters with well-settled theories as the only guide.Ponsonby-Fane, p. 324.

Boxing career  Criqui in fighting pose = Early career and military service = Criqui was born in the Belleville neighbourhood of Paris. He was a professional pipe-fitter before he turned professional in 1910. He won the French flyweight title in 1912. His boxing career was interrupted when he served in the French military in World War I. While doing guard duty at Verdun, his jaw was shattered by a sniper's bullet. A surgeon reconstructed the jaw using wire, silver, and a goat leg. = World featherweight champion = After the war he resumed boxing. He won the French featherweight title in 1921 and the next year won the European Boxing Union featherweight championship. On June 2, 1923, he beat Johnny Kilbane by a sixth-round knockout in New York City to win the world featherweight title. Part of the contract for this fight required that he give Johnny Dundee a shot at the title within sixty days. When he fought Dundee fifty-four days later (on July 26, 1923), Dundee knocked him down four times and beat him by a fifteen-round decision. In his next fight, Criqui injured his hand and did not fight many more fights before he retired in 1928.  Death  He died blind in a nursing home in 1977. He was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 2005, making him the second inductee from France after Marcel Cerdan.

Murray's entry on Henry J. Watt in Kazdin, A. E. (Ed.) (2000). Encyclopedia of Psychology (APA/Oxford) He was student of Oswald K√ºlpe and a member of the W√ºrzburg School. He is perhaps best known for his pioneering work on mental set in problem solving, what he referred to as \\"Einstellung\\" or \\"task mental set\\". Biography Watt was born and raised in Aberdeen, Scotland. He entered the University of Aberdeen in 1896, graduating with a Master's degree in philosophy in 1900. He attended the University of Berlin under the supervision of Carl Stumpf in 1901‚Äì1902, but then moved on to K√ºlpe and W√ºrzburg, where he completed his doctorate in 1906. Watt's dissertation was on thought processes and problem solving (Experimentelle Beitr√§ge zu einer Theorie des Denkens). An English abstract of his dissertation appeared in the journal article \\"Experimental Contribution to a Theory of Thinking\\" (1906). In 1907 Watt returned to Britain, taking up lectureships in psychophysiology at the University of Liverpool and, in 1908, in psychology at University of Glasgow. In 1909 he published The Economy and Training of Memory, a book for teachers. He was visiting W√ºrzburg in 1914 when World War I broke out, and was interned in a civilian prisoner. He was released and returned to Glasgow in 1915, his health permanently damaged. (American philosopher-psychologist George Stuart Fullerton suffered a similar fate.) In 1917, Watt published The Psychology of Sound, and, in 1919, The Psychology of Music, topics that he had studied under Stumpf more than 15 years earlier. Watt died in 1925 at the age of 46. Two additional books were published posthumously: The Sensory Basis and Structure of Knowledge (1925) and The Common Sense of Dreams (1929). In the latter, Watt proposed an alternative to Sigmund Freud's method of dream interpretation. Books *Watt, H. J. (1906) Experimental Contribution to a Theory of Thinking.

The SM.88, intended for export, was a light-medium, land based, multi-role fighter regarded as an advanced combat aircraft at the time of its debut in 1939. Though Savoia had already developed a similar twin boom aircraft, (the S.55) the layout was regarded as a new concept for Italian aircraft industries. The crew of three, two pilots and a rear gunner, were housed in a fully glazed ejectable crew nacelle located in the middle of the centre wing panel, behind the two Daimler-Benz DB 601 engines. The tail had two vertical rudders with a single horizontal surface between. The retractable landing gear consisted of four wheels, two in the front and back, respectively. The structure was a wooden frame covered with a metal skin. When the aircraft bombed a target, the pilot took on the role of bombardier, lying on the floor of the fuselage to sight the bombs, while the co-pilot flew the aircraft. The rear defensive gun was encased in a flexible plastic enclosure in the crew nacelle while two more 12.7 mm Breda-SAFAT machine guns were mounted in the wings. With the advent of World War II the Germans denied permission to export the DB 601 fitted to Italian aircraft. The Regia Aeronautica declined to order the aircraft due to the similar performance of the Messerschmitt Bf 110, which was already proven as reliable, in production and had better armament. In 1942 the Regia Aeronautica requested a redesign of the aircraft into a fast reconnaissance aircraft or bomber. They requested a range of 2,000 km (1,240 mi) with auxiliary tanks, or 1,500 km (930 mi) with 500 kg (1,100 lb) bombload (with an effective radius of 750 km (465 mi)).

In the United States, it was also simply called \\"pool\\" in the mid-19th century. It was one of several pool games that were popular at this time (so called because gamblers pooled their bets at the start of play). The object of the game was to be the last player left \\"alive\\" and therefore scoop the pool (take the winnings). Each player had three \\"lives\\" to begin with and would lose one when another player potted their which was designated to them at the start of the game. Using the same number of balls as players, players take turns striking their designated ball with the cue in an attempt to collide that ball with one (or more) of their opponents' balls knocking the opponent ball into a pocket.http://www.mastersgames.com/rules/life-pool-rules.htm Once a player lost their three lives, they were declared \\"dead\\", i.e. out of the game. The game continued in this way until there was only one player left, who was declared the winner.

Personal life and academic career Gwyn Jones was born on 24 May 1907 in New Tredegar, Monmouthshire, the second child of George Henry Jones (1874‚Äì1970), a miner, and his second wife, Lily Florence, n√©e Nethercott (1877‚Äì1960), a midwife. He was brought up in nearby Blackwood. He attended Tredegar county school and studied at University College, Cardiff as an undergraduate and a postgraduate. After six years he was a schoolteacher in Wigan and Manchester, in 1935 he returned to University College, Cardiff as a lecturer. In 1940 was appointed Professor of English of the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth, where he taught until his appointment as Professor of English at University College, Cardiff in 1964, a position he held until his retirement in 1975. In 1939 Jones registered as a conscientious objector to military service, which temporarily caused him to lose his job. Jones was a socialist, although never a member of the Labour Party, and was sympathetic to the aims of Plaid Cymru. He was an active Christian and attended Minny Street Chapel in Cardiff, a Welsh-language congregational chapel. Jones married twice: in 1928 to Alice Rees (1906/7‚Äì1979), and 1979 to Mair Jones, n√©e Sivell (1923/4‚Äì2000), the widow of Thomas Jones, his collaborator on The Mabinogion. Literary work Jones' translations include Four Icelandic Sagas (1935), The Vatndalers' Saga (1944), The Mabinogion (1948, in collaboration with Thomas Jones), Egil's Saga (1960), Eirik the Red and Other Icelandic Sagas (1961) and The Norse Atlantic Saga (1964). He also wrote A History of the Vikings (1968) and Kings, Beasts, and Heroes (1972). In addition to his translations, he was an author in the Anglo-Welsh tradition. His novels and story collections include Richard Savage (1935), Times Like These (1936), The Nine Days' Wonder (1937) and Garland of Bays (1938), The Buttercup Field (1945), The Flowers beneath the Scythe (1952), Shepherd's Hey (1953) and The Walk Home (1962). Jones also founded The Welsh Review in 1939, which he edited until 1948; this journal was important for raising discussion of Welsh issues and for attracting submissions from such authors as T. S. Eliot and J. R. R. Tolkien, whose Breton lay, The Lay of Aotrou and Itroun, he published in 1945.J. D. Rateliff, Mr Baggins Pt 1 (2007) p. 281-2 He continued to support Welsh literature by chairing both the Welsh Committee of the Arts Council of Great Britain and the first editorial board of The Oxford Companion to the Literature of Wales. In 1977 he edited the Oxford Book of Welsh Verse in English. He also published three sets of lectures on Anglo-Welsh literature: The First Forty Years (1957), Being and Belonging (1977), and Babel and the Dragon's Tongue (1981). Honours and commemorations In 1963 Jones was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Order of the Falcon by the President of Iceland, followed by the Commander's Cross in 1987. He was appointed CBE in the 1965 New Year Honours in recognition of his chairmanship of the Welsh Arts Council.

Design and development In July 1942, the Regia Aeronautica requested designs for a new aircraft, propelled by the German DB 605 engine, capable of flying at 620 km/h (385 mph) with a range of . The armament should consist of six MG 151 cannons in the nose and wings and a 12.7 mm Breda-SAFAT machine gun as a defensive weapon. It should have an bomb load. At that point, the request for a long-range fighter killed the SM.88, still in development, and the SM.91, a larger, heavier and more modern design, was authorized. The fuselage and the wings were all-metal, to achieve the best performance regardless of cost. The central nacelle held the crew of two, and the wings and tail were similar to the SM.88. Fuel capacity was 1,600 l, but with auxiliary tanks could be raised to 1,800 l. It is unknown if it was capable of a range of . The two DB 605 engines gave a total of 2,950 hp. The aircraft's maximum speed at 585 km/h (363 mph) was better than the SM.88. There were three 20 mm MG 151s in the nose. Two more were mounted in the wings, close to the fuselage. Another machine gun was provided for the rear gunner. Total bomb load was or a torpedo. The prototype, designated MM.530, flew for the first time on 11 March 1943, tested by Aldo Moggi. There were two prototypes, the second a modified SM.88 prototype. The machine flew at Vergiate and logged 27 hours in the next few months. It was advanced, but was not entered into the official tests at Guidonia, perhaps because it was still undergoing testing. The first prototype was captured and sent to Germany in October 1943, after which it vanished and is presumed destroyed. The second prototype was captured by the Germans incomplete when they occupied northern Italy in September 1943. This aircraft was tested on 10 July 1944, but was destroyed by Allied bombers later in the year.

The SM.92 did away with the mid- wing crew nacelle. The crew of two sat in the left fuselage only. Two DB 605 engines were fitted. Armament consisted of three 20 mm MG 151 cannon, two in the mid-wing and one in the right fuselage, and five 12.7 mm machine guns, two under each engine , and one remotely controlled in the tail. A bombload of up to 2,000 kg (4,400 lb) could be carried under the inner wing, and 160 kg (350 lb) bombs were carried under the outer wings. During development the maximum speed was increased, but it still did not meet requirements. It had a complex and advanced structure which contributed to difficulties in producing a working prototype.

He worked briefly at Eisner & Iger, one of the primary comic-book \\"packagers\\" that supplied outsourced comics on demand for publishers at the dawn of the new medium. Shortly thereafter, Cazeneuve, with his artist brother Arthur and Eisner & Iger colleague Pierce Rice, formed a studio that produced freelance art for a number of comics companies.\\"Obituary: Pierce Rice 1916-2003\\", The Comics Journal #254: reprinted in ComicsReporter.com, June 30, 2003.

With writer Joe Simon, editor-in-chief of Marvel Comics predecessor Timely Comics, he co-created the character Red Raven -- the first Timely/Marvel character to star in his own self-titled series, predating by several months Captain America Comics #1 (March 1941). From 1940 to 1942, Cazeneuve contributed to a number of Fox titles, drawing the stories introducing the superheroic characters Samson (Samson #1, Fall 1940); the Eagle (Weird Comics #8, Nov. 1940); the Banshee (Fantastic Comics #21, Aug. 1941); and U.S. Jones (Wonderworld Comics #28, Aug. 1941), as well as the villainous protagonist Nagana, Queen of Evil (Fantastic Comics #22, Sept. 1941).

Art by Louis Cazeneuve. It was at National Comics, the future DC Comics, that Cazeneuve did his most popular and prolific work during the Golden Age of Comics. He began on minor features, including \\"Bart Regan, Spy\\", in Detective Comics #61-63, 65-66, (March‚ÄìMay, July-Aug. 1942); \\"Three Aces\\", in Action Comics #47-63 (April 1942 - Aug. 1943); \\"TNT and Dyna-Mite\\", in Star Spangled Comics #10-23 (July 1942 - Aug. 1943); and \\"Radio Squad\\", in More Fun Comics #81-82 (July - Aug. 1942). Cazeneuve then began the two features for which he became best known. He succeeded creator Creig Flessel on the modern-day Arthurian feature \\"Shining Knight\\", drawing the feature for nearly three years in Adventure Comics #73-101 (April 1942 - Jan. 1945). More prominently, he became the second artist of the enduring character Aquaman, succeeding artist co-creator Paul Norris to become the longest-running artist of the undersea hero's Golden Age adventures. Cazeneuve debuted on \\"Aquaman\\" in More Fun Comics #82 (Aug. 1942), and continued with the feature through issue #107 (Feb. 1946), and its subsequent move to Adventure Comics #103-117, 119-120, 124 (April 1946 - June 1947, Aug.-Sept. 1947, Jan. 1948). He additionally drew the wartime \\"kid gang\\" feature \\"Boy Commandos\\" in World's Finest Comics #14-20 (Summer 1944 - Winter 1945/46), and penciled it in #24 (inked by George Klein). He inked two of their stories by co-creator and writer-penciler Jack Kirby in #21 (June 1947), and inked Curt Swan in #31 (Feb. 1949). Other DC characters on which Cazeneuve worked during the Golden Age include the Crimson Avenger, Green Arrow, the Seven Soldiers of Victory, and the Old West gunslinger Vigilante. One generally authoritative source states that Cazeneuve was ghost-artist for Jack Kirby on some stories in Boy Commandos #6-7 (Spring-Summer 1944).Louis Cazeneuve at the Grand Comics Database. Cazeneuve's other mid- to late Golden Age work included Feature Comics' \\"Yank and Doodle\\", and Harvey Comics' \\"Boy Heroes\\", \\"Captain Freedom\\", and \\"Shock Gibson\\". His last known credited DC Comics work is penciling and inking the six-page Aquaman story \\"The Sea Serpent\\" in Adventure Comics #124 (Jan. 1948). He then worked primarily for Fawcett Comics, starting with Whiz Comics #103 (Nov. 1948). Cazeneuve's last known credited comics work is penciling and inking the seven-page Western feature \\"Golden Arrow\\" in Whiz Comics #107 (March 1949).

The episode begins the series created by Tony Jordan, and made by Kudos Film & Television for BBC One in the United Kingdom. Plot The episode begins with Michael Stone's release from prison. Tricking Ash, Stacie and Albert into believing that he is to carry out one last con before he retires, Mickey forms a group to perform an investment scam on a businessman, Peter Williams, telling him to invest with brilliant returns. Danny, having not impressed Mickey earlier in the episode, turns up at a key moment in the con to convince Williams to take part, gaining him entry to the group. However, Danny is approached by police officers who tell him to testify to shorten the trial, and in a confrontation with Mickey, Mickey is shot in the head. Danny is faced with a choice: either testify against the other members of the group or go to prison with them. When he refuses, it is revealed that this dilemma was simply a test, Mickey isn't dead, and that the man leading the police investigation was a fellow con artist, as Stacy had stolen another Policeman's ID.

Founded in 1977, CCIDD offers Canadian and American students the opportunity to experience the struggle for justice in Latin America. Cuernavaca Center for Intercultural Dialogue on Development Over 500 groups and 10,000 students have attended CCIDD since its inception.http://www.ccidd.org/aboutus.htm Mission of CCIDD A Call to Service Making the journey to CCIDD requires not only the proper emotional state, but also the proper intentions. In an open letter concerning the value of service, Rachel Naomi Remen reminds us all to reevaluate our personal positions with respect to the dichotomy that inevitably exists between the notions of service and help. In effect, service can only be performed in \\"a relationship between equals\\" while help is based on a relationship of inequality, especially since it assumes that one side of the relationship is \\"stronger\\" than the other. (Also available from EBSCOhost) CCIDD therefore does not wish for its students to \\"help\\" the local Mexican population; let the tourists do that, it wants its students to \\"serve\\" the people. This service can either be direct or indirect. Direct service involves projects like painting schools, composting trash, and building houses. Indirect service includes initiating cross-cultural dialogues, visiting local archaeological sites, and reflecting upon the daily experiences that one undergoes. Liberation and Solidarity The program permits students the opportunity to get up close and personal with poverty in the developing world. Whereas North American students may be familiar with impoverished conditions on a localized level in their own nations, the program allows them to peer into the less developed societies of Latin America. For CCIDD, it is not so much about serving the poor in the sense of direct aid, but rather, the journey in Cuernavaca is fundamentally concerned with immersing the student in a foreign, and albeit, uncomfortable situation whereby one is faced with numerous challenges. These challenges can range anywhere from purchasing food in the local farmers' market to fashioning a dialogue with the people in La Estaci√≥n, which is a squatter settlement in a notoriously destitute section of Cuernavaca. Local Perception It is important to understand that cities like Cuernavaca have seen a recent influx of evangelical churches; many of which are there to pursue purely economic interests, like the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God, known for its motto \\"Pare de Sufrir.\\" Even the more benign organizations are not very well received by the more informed in Mexican society, which is overwhelmingly Catholic. While at CCIDD, students will have the opportunity to attend church (in Spanish) on a regular basis, if they so choose. The Cuernavaca Cathedral is quite awe-inspiring, as the elongated nave and overbearing transept is enough to make any person pause for a moment or two. The addition of the Mariachi band instead of a traditional church choir will surely surprise many North American students. Militarization of Latin America Another major issue that students encounter while at CCIDD is the rampant growth of militarism in Latin American countries. One of the biggest issues addressed at CCIDD is the Salvadoran Civil War, which raged for about twelve years (1980‚Äì1992) in the country of El Salvador. CCIDD typically has its students watch Voces inocentes (Innocent Voices), which is a dramatically realistic portrayal of the civil strife that wreaked havoc in El Salvador during the war. Aside from the Salvadoran conflict, CCIDD also instructs its students on the Zapatista movement in the southern Mexican province of Chiapas. For the most part, this movement is for indigenous people (the Mayans), by indigenous people (the Mayans), and all about indigenous people (the Mayans). In Mexico, there has been a systematic disenfranchisement of native peoples, somewhat like the Jim Crow laws of the early-to-mid twentieth century in the United States. Therefore, the Zapatistas have taken it upon themselves to oppose the blatant segregation in Mexican society by unifying in the name of natural rights. Ultimately, they wish to set about rebuilding the Mexican social structure in a manner conducive to the common benefit of all, rather than for the privileged wealth of a few.

It was one of several pool games that were popular at this time, and was forerunner to modern games such as eight-ball, blackball, straight pool and Russian pyramid. Rules were racked in a triangle with any remaining balls placed at the back of the triangle. It could be played by several players, with an agreed stake per ball pocketed, or with just two players in which case the winner is the one to first sink over half the balls. Teams were also allowed if there were an even number of players. In early versions of the game, when one object ball remained, the game shifted so one player took possession of the original cue ball, while the other used the object ball, as they attempted to sink the other player's designated ball. This rule was dropped in the United States during the late 19th century. An early version of pyramid pool awarded the entire pool to the player that sank the last ball. Originally, balls did not need be to . The calling of shots was added in the early 1880s in the United States. History Cartoon by Adolf Oberl√§nder The earliest rules were recorded in Vienna in 1795 under the name √† la Figaro or √† la pyramide. In Continental Europe, the game was played with a red cue ball and unnumbered white object balls. Any number of object balls could be used, but the earliest minimum was twelve with later rule books recommending fifteen, twenty-one, or twenty-four balls. The game arrived in English-speaking countries by 1850 but the colours were reversed with the cue ball being white and the object balls red. Legacy In 1875, this game combined with black pool to form snooker. In the United States, pyramid pool developed into fifteen-ball pool, a precursor to rotation and straight pool. Since the middle of the 20th century, the American version of pyramid pool has been known as basic pool or basic pocket billiards which now uses modern pool balls.

Christie wrote poetry for most of her life; her first traceable published works are three poems from 1919: World Hymn in The Poetry Review issue for March/April, Dark Sheila in Poetry Today issue for May/June and A Passing in the same journal for November/December.Japanese website with details of publications All three poems are reprinted in The Road of Dreams (with the first under the slightly amended title of World Hymn, 1914). The book is divided into four sections: * A Masque from Italy * Ballads * Dreams and Fantasies * Other Poems The final section includes a poem titled In a Dispensary which mentions many of the poisons that Christie would use in her long fictional career. Literary response The Times Literary Supplement in its issue of 26 February 1925 praised A Masque from Italy and other selected poems whilst stating that \\"her talent, however, is too delicate to turn a ballad convincingly\\" and World Hymn, 1914 was a \\"subject too large for her hand to grasp\\". It did conclude, however, by stating that in poems such as Beatrice Passes (from Dreams and Fantasies) her \\"real poetic gift is best displayed\\".The Times Literary Supplement 26 February 1925 (Page 142) The Scotsman of 23 March 1925 said, Forgotten creations Christie does not mention the book in her autobiography. Her official biography recounts that Eden Philpotts, a family friend, wrote to her and told her she \\"had great lyric gifts\\". He also warned her that it would not sell well, and was proven right when copies remained unbound and unsold well into the 1960s.Morgan, Janet. Agatha Christie, A Biography.

Williams (August 6, 1923 - August 3, 1986), was an American disc jockey on New York City radio station WNEW for over four decades. He hosted the popular program Make Believe Ballroom. Williams is particularly noted for coining the title \\"Chairman of the Board\\" for Frank Sinatra. Unusually, Williams appeared in the November, 1966 issue of Detective Comics, in a story which involved Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson, the civilian identities of Batman and Robin, appearing on his show. He was given a prominent appearance on the cover for the occasion.https://www.comics.org/issue/20527/cover/4/ Early life Born William Breitbard in Babylon, New York, (brother of Ric Roman (Earl Breitbard) character actor in Hollywood films \\"Some Came Running\\" and television). Williams himself graduated from Babylon Senior High School and attended Syracuse University for one year before dropping out.Hinckley, David, \\"No Jock: William B. Williams, New York Daily News, October 11, 2005 In 1944, he was hired as a staff announcer at WAAT in Newark, New Jersey while visiting a friend at the station. According to Williams \\"the guy who did the all-night show had just been fired for being bombed on the air.\\"\\"William B. Williams, Radio Personality, Dies\\", The New York Times, August 4, 1986 Six weeks later, a staffer at WNEW heard Williams on the air and invited him to apply for a job at the station. He was hired at WNEW and worked several time slots before being fired by station manager Bernice Judis in 1947. An article in the New York Daily News suggested that Williams was fired for his aggressive tactics with management in his role as shop steward; however, WNEW's official story was that he was fired after Judis caught him one evening in the studio with his feet propped on the desk clad in bright red socks. She was apparently horrified by his lack of style.Nightingale Gordon, WNEW - Where the Melody Lingers On, 1984. Williams worked at several other stations, including WOR, but was rehired at WNEW in 1953 following a management change. He hosted the William B. Williams Show in the morning hours, and Music in a Sentimental Mood in the afternoon from 1:00 to 2:00 p.m. Make Believe Ballroom In 1954, the originator of the Make Believe Ballroom program in New York, Martin Block, left WNEW for a new job at ABC Radio. Jerry Marshall took over the show for three years, after which Williams was tapped to host the program. He marked the broadcast as his own, using the distinctive sign-on, \\"Hello, world\\", and occasionally identifying himself as \\"Guilliermo B. Guilliermos\\" or \\"Wolfgang B. Wolfgang,\\" although to listeners and friends he was known simply as \\"Willie B.\\" He combined intimate knowledge of music with his personal anecdotes to create a smooth style that captivated listeners. By 1965 Billboard reported Williams was earning $105,000 a year, tops for the station at that time but slightly less than the other famous Williams, Ted, earned at his baseball peak ($125,000).Billboard, March 27, 1965 Friars Club Williams developed lasting relationships with the top singers of the Great American Songbook, including Lena Horne and Nat King Cole. Early in his career, he befriended Frank Sinatra when the crooner recorded broadcasts at WNEW. On one broadcast, Williams mused that since Benny Goodman was the \\"King of Swing\\" and Duke Ellington was a duke, then Sinatra must have a title as well, suggesting \\"Chairman of the Board.\\" Sinatra learned of the comment and embraced the title. Later, when interest in standards flagged, Williams persisted in playing Sinatra's music and is credited with a key role in keeping Sinatra's career afloat. Sinatra, to whom loyalty was a key virtue, never forgot Williams and lauded him to any and all who would listen. Rock 'n Roll As the emergence of rock 'n roll music began in the 1950s, Williams left no doubt as to where he stood on the subject: against. \\"Most of it's so bad it's embarrassing,\\" he said. \\"In the days of the big bands, a vocalist had to be able to sing....I believe teenagers are hungry to hear good music, and at some point we must assume a lot of the blame for the quality of what is being heard. I use the word 'we' to mean disc jockeys and radio stations in general.\\" A well-known advertisement of the era showed Williams holding his nose under the caption \\"We asked William B. Williams of WNEW Radio what he thought of rock 'n' roll.\\" Still, beginning in the late 1950s, WNEW began mixing in softer tunes from rock artists, which continued into the 1960s. While WNEW was still playing pop standards, soft rock was a big part of the format, making them a MOR station. Williams hated most of these songs, but played them when he had to. In the 1970s, WNEW became more of an adult contemporary radio station, mixing in very few pop standards. Williams stated that the during the period from 1965 to 1978, WNEW was at its worst, but finally came to its senses. By then, the Make Believe Ballroom title was dropped from Williams' show, although he continued to host in the late morning and early afternoon. In the fall of 1979, much to Williams' happiness, WNEW began restoring the standards format on weekends, middays, and late nights, leading off with a revived Make Believe Ballroom on October 6. In January 1981, WNEW dropped the adult contemporary format (which by then was only heard on weekday mornings and late afternoons) altogether, adopting the standards format full-time. Other Activity From the late 1970s until the mid-1980s, Williams became a TV spokesman for the New York- based Genovese Drug Stores chain, pitching the week's specials and delivering the tagline \\"A real drug store, and so much more!\\". In the last year of his life, in the mid-1980s, Williams hosted Encore, a national radio show syndicated by Westwood One. Williams' episodes were distributed to stations again in 1989 and 1990. Friars Club The Friars Club Monument in Kensico CemeteryWilliams was an officer and long-time member of the New York Friars' Club. He was named Man of the Year by the club in 1984 (in a ceremony hosted by Sinatra.) One year later, the Friars Club Foundation made him the recipient of its Applause Award. in recognition of his charitable efforts. Williams is one of a select group of figures, including Sinatra, George Burns, Billy Crystal and Milton Berle to have a room named for him at the Friars Club in midtown Manhattan.Friars Club website Personal The gravesite of William B.

Ismail Fahmy () (2 October 1922 ‚Äì 21 November 1997)Profile of Ismail Fahmy was an Egyptian diplomat and politician. He served as ambassador to Austria (1968‚Äì1971), tourism minister (1973), foreign minister (1973‚Äì1977) and deputy prime minister (1975‚Äì1977). He was awarded to professorship. He resigned from the government in 1977 to protest Anwar Sadat's visit to Jerusalem. Although he was a supporter and confidant of Sadat, later he became sharply critical of Sadat‚Äôs policies and decision making. Early life and education Fahmy was born on 2 October 1922. His father was a public prosecutor in Cairo. He held a degree in political science from Cairo University in 1945. Early career Fahmy joined ministry of foreign affairs in 1946. He served as a diplomat a part of the Egypt's delegation to the United Nations from 1949 to 1957. He was an intelligent, able, assertive, self-confident and articulate diplomat.[ Joseph Sisco. An Egyptian Foreign Minister‚Äôs Memoirs. The New York Times, 19 June 1983] He was an activist and a tough negotiator. Then he served in the Egypt's delegation on the International Atomic Energy Agency until 1959. Next he returned to Egypt and worked at the foreign office. He was appointed ambassador to Austria between 1968. From 1969 to 1970 he served as the ambassador of Egypt to France. His next post was deputy foreign minister which he held from 1971 to November 1973. Fahmy came to attention of Sadat at a symposium in Egypt. His arguments about the Egyptian military action against Israel, re-evolution and reshaping of Egyptian- Soviet relationships, closer contact with the US and the involvement with both Moscow and Washington in solving the Middle East conflict impressed Sadat, who appointed Fahmy foreign minister after 1973 October War. Foreign Minister of Egypt, 1973‚Äì1977 Fahmy served as foreign minister from October 31, 1973 to November 17, 1977. He decided to keep lines of communication open between Egypt and Soviet Union. However Fahmy recounts certain events in which he was directly involved: his first encounters with Henry Kissinger and Richard Nixon; his participation in talks leading to the Egyptian-Israeli disengagement agreements of 1974 and 1975. He reluctantly supported the first agreement and opposed to the second. He met with both US and Soviet foreign ministers.

He served as both Chairman and President of the Welsh Academy's English-language section. His study The Dragon Has Two Tongues (1968) discusses ways in which the interwar period affected his generation of Welsh authors. Early life Glyn Jones was born in Merthyr Tydfil in 1905 into a Welsh-speaking household. His father was a post office clerk and his mother a teacher.Brown (2001), p. 38 Despite Welsh being his family language he was educated in English, as were all attending mainstream education in Wales in the first half of the 20th century. Jones gained a place at Cyfarthfa Castle Grammar School, and by the time he left secondary education, he had all but lost his ability to speak Welsh fluently. However, he re-taught himself Welsh in later life, although his literary work was always in English. After leaving Cyfarthfa Grammar, he gained a place at St Paul's College in Cheltenham. From an early age Jones was a devout Christian; his parents being Welsh Nonconformists. Jones attended Sunday School as a child and in his later life he was a member of Minny Street Congregational Chapel in Cardiff. His religious beliefs and his Welshness informed all his creative work, even when many of his contemporary authors rejected religion. On leaving full-time education Jones found work as a teacher, leaving Merthyr to take up a post in Cardiff, where the poverty of his pupils profoundly disturbed him, and informed his political position as a socialist. Although a left-wing thinker, Jones was never a member of the Labour Party; in his later life he was sympathetic to the aims of Plaid Cymru. In 1935, he married Phyllis Doreen Jones, to whom all his books were dedicated. His earliest poetry was published in 1933 in The Dublin Magazine, and in 1935, on the suggestion of his friend Dylan Thomas, he wrote a collection of short stories, entitled The Blue Bed. The collection included tales located in undefined, almost mystical locations, and others retailing Welsh village life in a comic and highly visual way. He received a remarkable critical assessment from reviewers in London. One of the tales from The Blue Bed, \\"I was Born in the Ystrad Valley\\", tells of an armed Communist insurrection and was born from his own experiences of life in the Cardiff slums. His initial writings were heavily influenced by the fellow Welsh author Caradoc Evans, although The Blue Bed did not carry the harsh tones of Evans's work. During the Second World War Jones registered in 1940 as a conscientious objector. This decision saw him dismissed from his teaching post by Cardiff Education Committee, although he found another teaching job in Glamorgan soon afterwards. Literary career Jones continued writing, with a collection of poems being published in 1939. His first literary critique of poetry was of English Romantic poetry, of which he shared a style of striking imagery and sensuous language, being drawn to both D. H. Lawrence and Gerard Manley Hopkins. Jones was particularly impressed by Hopkins, and wrote an essay on the latter's awareness of Welsh poetic metrics. The 1940s saw two more works published, a second collection of poetry, The Dream of Jake Hopkins (1944) and a second book of short stories The Water Music and other stories (1944). As in his earlier work, The Water Music saw his tales set in either the industrial Merthyr of his childhood, or the greener landscape of Carmarthenshire. The 1950s and 1960s saw Jones concentrate on writing his three novels, The Valley, The City, The Village (1956), The Learning Lark (1960) and The Island of Apples (1965). His first novel, The Valley, The City, The Village, a bildungsroman centred on a young artist, is full of description and character, though it was criticised by some reviewers for its lack of formal unity and overly exotic language. However, some critics, such as Meic Stephens, believe that Jones's use of a variety of narrative and rhetorical techniques make the work a tour-de-force. His second novel, The Learning Lark, is a picaresque send-up of the education system in a corrupt mining village. But despite reflecting ugly-natured teachers bribing their way to headships, there is no biting satire, and the book is full of comic tones, with Jones holding up a mirror to the flaws in human traits. His third novel, The Island of Apples, set in a fictionalised Merthyr, uses the myth of Ynys Afallon to explore the pain of the loss of childhood. It is again told through the eyes of a young narrator. During the 1960s, Jones was at the centre of a literary controversy, when Scottish poet Hugh MacDiarmid lifted verbatim lines from one of Jones' short stories and published them as part of his poem Perfect. Although Jones himself remained silent on the issue, supporters of both men filled columns in The Times Literary Supplement, arguing over the merits of the situation. MacDiarmid later stated that he had a photographic memory, and that he must have used Jones's lines unconsciously. In later years neither poet showed much distress when they met, and were able to laugh off the controversy. The decade also saw Jones publish his most important work, The Dragon has Two Tongues, a criticism of Anglo-Welsh literature; an autobiographical work examining the effect of education, religion and politics on a generation of Welsh writers between the two World Wars, and an important account of his friendship with several important Welsh writers including Caradoc Evans, Dylan Thomas, Gwyn Jones and Keidrych Rhys. The 1970s saw Jones return to poetry and short stories, with two collections of stories published, Selected Short Stories (1971) and Welsh Heirs (1977). Between them came a poetic compilation, Selected Poems (1975). In the 1980s, Jones spent increasing time translating Welsh-language works into English. Although Jones was now a fluent Welsh speaker, he never wrote in his mother tongue, once stating that his Welsh was \\"...the language of adolescence, not the mother tongue, [which] the artist will be likely to use for his creative purposes.\\" Jones first translated Welsh texts in 1954, working with T. J. Morgan on The Saga of Llywarch the Old. In 1981 he worked on his own translations with When the Rose Bush brings forth Apples followed by Honeydew on the Wormwood: a further selection of old Welsh verses in 1984. Relations with Dylan Thomas In 1934 Jones wrote to Dylan Thomas, after reading his poem The Woman Speaks, which had been published in The Adelphi.Ferris (1989), p. 101. Both men were relative unknown in that period, but the correspondence led to a long-lasting friendship between the two.Ferris (1989), p. 102. They met at Whitsun 1934. Jones, who had a car, drove the two of them to Laugharne; and Thomas later described Jones to his girlfriend, Pamela Hansford Johnson, as \\"a nice, handsome young man with no vices\\".Ferris (1989), p. 107. Later that year, the two men met again, this time to visit fellow poet Caradoc Evans. After the visit, while the men shared a hotel room, Jones recalled the tale of Welsh eccentric Dr. William Price, who cremated his young son without official permission after the child's death. Thomas later turned the tale into the story \\"The Burning Baby\\".Ferris (1989), p. 114. The next year, Thomas invited Jones to London. Amongst the artists of London, Jones found that Thomas would change his viewpoint to suit the group of people he was talking to, a trait that made Jones uneasy.Ferris (1989), p. 140. As Thomas grew in fame, he and Jones saw less of each other, but in December 1949, Jones was to interview his old friend for a BBC radio programme, How I Write. Jones travelled to Laugharne to meet Thomas at his home, the Boathouse. Jones was shocked at how much his friend had changed, with his face bloated and pale, symptoms of years of heavy drinking. They discussed what they would say in the broadcast, but a few days before Christmas, the producers received a call from Thomas' wife, saying that he was ill with \\"broken ribs\\", and the interview never took place.Ferris (1989), p. 249. Awards and later life Jones was seen as an important and influential writer in Welsh literary circles. He was elected President of the Welsh Academy and in 1985 became the Academy's first honorary member. This was proceeded in 1971 by an award from the Arts Council of Wales for his contribution to the literature of Wales. He was also awarded an honorary Doctor of Literature by the University of Glamorgan in 1994 and an Honorary Fellowship by Trinity College, Carmarthen. In 1988 he was made an honorary member of the Gorsedd of Bards. In his final years, Jones's health suffered. He was forced to have his right arm amputated, but he continued to correspond with fellow writers, in what he saw as a vital link in the history of Welsh literature. He died in Cardiff on 10 April 1995.

Sanders was the founder of the political party, Mebyon Kernow, in 1951. She was also well known for her feline welfare efforts in Venice.  Biography  Sanders was born in Kolkata and her mother died when she was three. In the 1920s she worked in the slums of Bermondsey. During the Second World War, she joined the London Ambulance Service. She organised assistance for displaced members of the population of Heligoland and also Jewish refugees during and after the war. She graduated from Oxford in 1948 and by 1949 she became the Cornish representative on the Central Committee of European Communities and Regions. In 1950, she organised a group of actors to perform the play Bewnans Meriasek in Cornish at the Celtic Congress. It was performed in several places in Cornwall and was Cornwall's entry to the Festival of Britain.The Cornish Language and Its Literature By Peter Berresford Ellis, p.172 (Accessed on Google Books 24 March 2008). Sanders was the first leader of the Cornish political party Mebyon Kernow (MK), founded by herself in January 1951. Sanders felt that Cornish culture was being destroyed. She went on to lead the party for four years. Sanders was the also the first person to put MK policies to the electorate when she won a seat on Camborne‚ÄìRedruth Urban District Council in 1953. Her slogan was 'A Square Deal for the Cornish.' Sanders had a more \\"separatist\\" agenda than others in the party, which led to divisions within the group. She was succeeded as Chairman of MK by Major Cecil Beer in 1957.Bernard Deacon, Dick Cole, Garry Tregidga, Mebyon Kernow and Cornish Nationalism, Welsh Academic Press, 2003. Sanders also founded and served as editor for New Cornwall, a monthly magazine effectively serving as the voice of Mebyon Kernow. She was interested in the governing structure of the Isle of Man as a potential model for Cornwall and sympathized with other Celtic nationalist and separatist movements. She became a member of Gorseth Kernow under the Bardic name of Maghteth Boudycca ('Daughter of Boudicca') at Trethevy Quoit in 1953.Gorseth Byrth Kernow (1967) Bards of the Gorsedd of Cornwall 1928-1967, Penzance: Gorseth She organised residential courses in the Cornish language, where Richard Gendall and Tony Snell met and wrote poetry in the language. She married sculptor, Guy Sanders, in 1959. She went to Venice in 1964 and, saddened by the large number of emaciated stray cats in the city she co-founded the Dingo charity to work for the welfare of the feral cats. The name of the charity came from co-founder, Mabel Raymonde Hawkin's dog, who was also named Dingo. Their work in Venice wasn't always understood, with some Venetians misunderstanding their intentions. Eventually, Sanders and Hawkins were able to educate residents about the cats and how to improve their living conditions. Some strays were killed due to health issues and others were neutered with the consent of Venetian authorities. Sanders and Hawkins were the first people in Italy to use the process of trap-neuter-return (TNR) to control cat populations. Her husband, Guy, became a licensed gondolier to help raise money for Dingo. Sanders also founded the Cornwall Christian Fellowship for Animals and the Cornwall Cat Rescue Group. For her work in Venice she was made a Knight of St Mark. When her husband died in 1985, she moved to Haddenham. She worked on her autobiography towards the end of her life and died on 14 June 1997.  Legacy  A television show about Sanders' efforts to rescue cats in Venice aired on the Discovery Channel.

The inkling is presumed to trigger an affect which encapsulates and saturates all human experience. In everyday life, inklings induce detection either via human enactments (through habitual behavior) or through spontaneous devotion (conscious expression in the arts). The term episteme is related to the Greek word ŒµœÄŒπœÉœÑŒÆŒºŒ∑, which translates literally as standing near or by that which causes but is often simplified as knowledge or science. By ignoring ego interests the core impetus or the essence of a deed, real or imagined, is recovered. History Episteme psychology began with the 1940s written works of Gaston Bachelard, whose many books focused on poetics and (day-) dreaming. Episteme psychology was established as a separate discipline in the late 1980s through the work of v.d. Stok v. Alten√¶.

It is also the six-cylinder sibling to the Saleen XP8, which remains identical in appearance and upgrades to the XP6 except for an eight-cylinder engine, with or without supercharger. The Saleen XP6 comes in two- or four-wheel-drive four-door configurations, packing only a SOHC 4.0-liter V-6 engine configuration. No supercharger was available at the time of production.  Production Quantities  The Saleen XP6 remains an even more elusive vehicle than its sibling, the Saleen XP8, because it was entirely a \\"mistake.\\" Saleen had ordered a batch of Explorers in 1998 for transformation into a XP8, however, some six cylinder Explorer XLT's were thrown into the batch. Rather than send the Explorers back for an exchange, which would result in lost time and money for Saleen, they decided to outfit the six cylinder Explorer XLT's instead with the XP8 package. Thus, the XP6 was born. As a result of this \\"mistake\\", the production numbers for the XP6 are extremely low. It is estimated that a maximum of ten are in existence. Six have been confirmed through the ExplorerX Saleen XP6/XP8 Owner Registry Database.ExplorerX - Saleen  Specifications  Saleen lowers the Explorer about 2 inches, for both improved handling and appearance. Springs and shocks are swapped for the company's Racecraft components, and rolling stock is upgraded to Saleen's own 18-inch genuine magnesium wheels wrapped by Pirelli 255/55SR18 Scorpion S/T radials. The exterior appearance package includes special front and rear fascia, side skirts, door cladding, roof-mounted rear wing, and carbon fiber trim. The cabin is treated to either a real wood or carbon fiber appearance package, depending upon color choice, as well as Saleen gauge faces and floor mats. A particularly nice, though pricey, option is Saleen/RECARO leather seating ($3950), offering 10-way power adjustment up front and hip-hugging support. Engine Bore & Stroke: 3.95in x 3.32in Displacement: 4.0L / 245cid Compression Ratio: 9.7:1 Horsepower: 205hp / 5,000 RPM Torque: 250lb/ft / 3,000 RPM Drive Train Transmission: 5 Speed automatic Brakes ABS: Three channel, four sensor system Disc Brakes: Front & Rear Front: 13in vented disc four piston caliper (optional) These front disc brakes were eventually recalled and replaced with stock Explorer calipers, again due to lack of structural integrity. Additional Options * Carbon Fiber hood * Premium Sound System * Integrated LCD Display * Saleen Recaro Leather interior  Variation in models  Like the XP8, each Saleen XP6 may vary dramatically in appearance and options, as a result of Saleen farming the production of the XP6's to California bodyshops and Ford dealers. Many of the options available in Saleen XP6's, such as the carbon fiber composite hood and carbon fiber accents were installed outside of the Saleen Inc. compound. Therefore, many XP6's vary significantly with options installed. There is no XP6 with a supercharger option, as there was no supercharger kit available to V6 Explorers at the time.  Availability  Saleen XP6's are now well past their final production date (1998), and as such, can only be purchased through online advertisements and car auction websites such as eBay Motors. Prices vary significantly due to condition, mileage, and most importantly, options installed. Sale prices can vary between $8,000 to $15,000 depending on the above. Additionally, all performance and appearance parts for the XP6's have ceased production back in 2001. Parts are virtually impossible to find and purchase, and reproduction costs are sky high due to low demand and basically, the owner of the vehicle themselves footing the bill. Saleen XP6 parts are no longer available through Saleen whatsoever, even to owners. Saleen does, however offer repair services for the XP6 and its parts in the event that accident repair should prove necessary. This has led to what some owners describe as the \\"glass-slipper effect\\", as that if any substantial damage were to occur, replacement parts are not an option. Therefore, because of this and the very low production numbers to begin with of the XP6, the XP6 maintains a distinct allure to Ford and Saleen enthusiasts unfounded in many other vehicles.  Records  The Saleen Book, an official book produced by Saleen detailing the history and production numbers of Saleen vehicles past and present, noticeably neglected to cover and feature the XP6 and XP8. As such, the Saleen Explorer XP6/XP8 Owner Registry Database was created on ExplorerX, an active Ford Explorer enthusiast website to maintain records. Although unofficial, it remains the only and most active list dedicated to Saleen XP6 and XP8 vehicles. An active XP6 and XP8 community resides there.

She became established in the midwest before moving to Los Angeles in the mid-1960s. Jazz critics have compared her to Dinah Washington, Sarah Vaughan, Carmen McRae, and Ella Fitzgerald.  Early life  Dolorez Alexandria Turner was born on August 14, 1929, in Chicago, Illinois. Growing up she began singing gospel music in church choirs and traveled throughout the Midwest with a traveling Baptist a cappella group. Later, when she entered the Chicago club circuit, she became a regular performer at venues like the Brass Rail and the Cloister Inn.Carr, Ian, Digby Fairweather, Brian Priestly and Charles Alexander. The Rough Guide to Jazz. Penguin Books, 2004, p. 10. In Chicago, Alexandria became a local favorite and recorded for the first time for several independent local labels, most notably King Records, and later Argo Records. During this early part of her career, she was closely connected with the Chicago pianist, composer and bandleader Walter \\"King\\" Fleming who would go on to provide the accompaniment for her debut album This is Lorez.Friedwald, Will. A Biographical Guide to the Great Jazz and Pop Singers. Pantheon Books, 2010, p. 732.  Career  =King records= In 1957, Alexandria was signed to King Records. That year she released her first album This is Lorez with the King Fleming Quartet, followed by Lorez Sings Pres: A Tribute to Lester Young, which was an homage to the legendary tenor saxophonist. Her second album was received quite well and achieved widespread popularity. Featured on the LP were trumpet players Paul Serrano and Cy Touff, with King Fleming providing the accompaniment. The album featured a number of tunes from the songbook of Billie Holiday, a close friend of Lester Young. On the track \\"No Eyes Blues\\" Alexandria effortlessly scats with the ease of Ella Fitzgerald, as Serrano and Touff jump in to accent her rich melodic line. She recorded two more albums for King Records in 1959, releasing the LPs The Band Swings ‚Äì Lorez Sings and Singing Songs That Everyone Knows back to back. On The Band Swings, Alexandria played with a full orchestra for the first time, and vocally engages the listener by swinging, scatting, and paraphrasing, reminiscent to some of the timbre achieved by Sarah Vaughan and Carmen McRae. =Argo records= Alexandria went on to collaborate with pianist Ramsey Lewis, with whom she had played as far back as 1958, and some of Count Basie's sidemen, releasing the LP Early in the Morning on Argo in 1960. On the title track, she proves her comfort with the blues, backed up by a rhythm section that creates just enough space for her to fill alongside explosions of blue notes by Lewis on the piano. She produced three more LPs on the label ‚Äì including Sing No Sad Songs for Me in 1961 which featured a full string section, and Deep Roots in 1962, which featured trumpeter Howard McGhee. Her last album for Argo, and the last album that she made in Chicago, For Swingers Only, came out in 1963 before she left the midwest for California.Friedwald,A Biographical Guide to the Great Jazz and Pop Singers, 2010, p. 733. =Impulse! Records= Impulse!, a jazz label and subsidiary of ABC-Paramount Records, was established in 1960 in Santa Monica, California, by producer Creed Taylor. John Coltrane was among the first artists signed to the label, which in retrospect came to be known as \\"the house that Trane built.\\" In 1964 Alexandria moved to Los Angeles in pursuit of further opportunities to perform in clubs and record, quickly becoming a featured vocalist at popular venues that included the Parisian Room and Marla's Memory Lane.Thurber, John. Lorez Alexandria; Jazz Singer Noted for Style. The Los Angeles Times. May 24, 2001. Getting signed to Impulse! Records was anticipated to be her jump onto the national stage after seven years of working with independent labels at King and Argo.Khan, Ashley. The House That Trane Built: The Story of Impulse Records. W. W. Norton & Company, 2007. p. 1734 Alexandria's 1964 album Alexandria the Great, her first on Impulse!, was produced by Bob Thiele, known for his work with John Coltrane. Wynton Kelly joined her on piano, with Paul Horn and Bud Shank alternating on flute, Victor Feldman on vibraphone, Ray Crawford on guitar, Paul Chambers on bass and Jimmy Cobb on drums. Chambers and Cobb had stuck together in the same rhythm section since playing with Miles Davis on his classic 1959 album Kind of Blue.Johnson, David Brent. Alexandria the Great. Night Lights Radio Program. Indiana Public Media. 2005. Her rhythmic and melodic interpretation of lyric on \\"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\\" redefined the texture of the composition and reflected her ability to make well known songs her own. Her second album on Impulse!, More of the Great Lorez Alexandria, was released later in 1964 and produced by Tutti Camarata. Shortly thereafter, though, her relationship with the label ended in the midst of a decision by the headquarters of ABC Records that vocal music should be housed on the pop side of the company.  Musical style  In the liner notes of Alexandria the Great she wrote: \\"My grandmother on my mother's side was a minister, my grandmother on my father's side was a minister, and my mother's sister is married to a Methodist minister so this influence is very strong. Everyone in my family sings.\\"Alexandria, Lorez. Liner Notes ‚Äì Alexandria the Great. Impulse! Records. 1964. In the mid 1960s while being interviewed for a piece in the jazz magazine Down Beat, she said that: > \\"I tried actually to divorce myself from singing with religious overtones or > aspects...Maybe it's because I had this kind of background. The Gospelizing > or use of so-called \\"soul\\" singing ‚Äì that sort of thing ‚Äì has become very > large in the business. [But] I'm not a shouter and I'm not a Gospel singer. > I wasn't a Gospel singer when I was singing in the church. I can't yell; I > can't do this other thing. But I was effective... Anybody can sing > spiritually without being labeled a Gospel singer.\\"Dahl, Linda. Stormy > Weather: The Music and Lives of a Century of Jazzwomen. Proscenium > Publishers, 1984, p. 153. When asked what made her singing style unique, she once said \\"my feeling for a lyric, I'm a storyteller and I try to have excellent diction so you don't have to guess what I'm saying. Some people listen to a song for years and don't know what the lyric is.\\" In 1965 while listening to \\"Violets For Your Furs\\" by Billie Holiday, Alexandria said: > \\"There's not too much left to say about Billie Holiday, how is it possible > for a woman to be this great? This comes from a period when she wasn't > supposed to be singing too well but I've never heard anything by her that I > didn't realize what she was feeling which is very important regardless of > the shape of the pipes or what may be happening . She always got the message > across. She never failed.\\"  Later recordings  Beginning in 1978 and continuing until 1993, Alexandria resumed recording, releasing several albums with a number of record labels, including Discovery, Trend and Muse. Between 1980 and 1984, she released a three volume tribute to the composer Johnny Mercer, Sings the Songs of Johnny Mercer, Vol. 1, Sings the Songs of Johnny Mercer, Vol. II: Harlem Butterfly, and Sings the Songs of Johnny Mercer, Vol. III: Tangerine. On Harlem Butterfly and Tangerine, Alexandria was backed up by Los Angeles pianist Gildo Mahones and his quartet that featured Herman Riley on saxophone, Andy Simpkins on bass, and Carl Burnett on drums. On Vol. 1 she was supported by the Mike Wofford Quartet. Gordon Brisker, the tenor saxophonist, contributed many of the arrangements for Alexandria's 1987 album Dear to My Heart, released by Trend Records. On this record, Alexandria displayed that she still had the ability to re-imagine well known standards. I'll Never Stop Loving You, her second album released on Muse Records in spring 1992 featured Herman Riley on tenor saxophone and flute and pianist Gildo Mahones, with whom she had collaborated in 1984. On her last album, Star Eyes, released in June 1993, Alexandria was joined by tenor saxophonist Houston Person, guitarist Bruce Forman, pianist Stan Hope, bassist Peter Weiss and drummer Michael Carvin. Shortly after Star Eyes was released, she suffered a stroke and never fully recovered. After retiring in Gardena, California, she told a friend: \\"I'm tired ‚Äì I've had my day.\\" In 1989, Impulse! reissued Alexandria the Great and More of the Great Lorez Alexandria on a single CD. Between 2004 and 2005, Verve Records also re-released both records separately. In 2001, at the age of 74, Alexandria died, remembered by some as one of the most under-appreciated jazz vocalists of the 20th century.All Music Guide to Jazz: The Definitive Guide to Jazz Music'.\\" Ed. by Vladimir Bogdanov, Chris Woodstra, Stephen Thomas Erlewine.

It is notably home to vulnerable Black-necked cranes, many rare and beautiful orchids, and Himalayan Yew, a coniferous tree whose extracts are a source of the anticancer drug, paclitaxel. Visitor information Bita Hai Lake at Potatso National Park. Photo taken from near the bus stop before starting the walk around the right side of the lake. The park is about a 50-minute drive from Zhongdian. It has two lakes, a visitor center, several interesting minority villages, lush forests and pasture views. From the visitor center a park bus takes visitors to the first stop, away from where there are several miles of raised wooden walkways around the Shudu Lake (Â±ûÈÉΩÊπñ). The next bus destination is Bita Hai Lake (Á¢ßÂ°îÊµ∑), above sea level. It is surrounded by dense deciduous forests. The bus stops a few feet from a wharf from where visitors can take a boat ride around the lake and to the island in the center. Price for the boat ride is 50 Yuan. It is just over from where the boat disembarks to the bus pick up point. Alternatively, one may walk down the path from the South entrance and hike to and exit the park from the West entrance. Getting to the West entrance requires both a boat and ferry ride. The entire hike can take 4‚Äì6 hours. Riding horses are also available.

In 1994, Oordt funded and directed the startup of shopper publications for the Providence Journal, successfully launching the newspaper in Rhode Island and Massachusetts Shopper Enterprises‚Äô network of 38 publications. Mr. Oordt also acquired Minnesota Sun Publication from the Guy Gannet Co in 1995. Sun Publication served 329,000 homes in the Minneapolis suburbs. This venture involved the acquisition and complete overhaul of a group of underperforming properties that, under Oordt's ownership and direction, were transformed into a successful nationwide publishing network. In 2010, Oordt purchased a group of regional newspapers in the Philadelphia Metro area that included the Northeast Times (circulation approximately 111,000) and the Star and Home News (circulation approximately 60,000) and formed Broad Street Media, LLC. Oordt subsequently closed several publications, including the Star of Manayunk, East Falls and Roxborough; the Three Star (serving Kensington, Harrowgate and Juniata; and the Girard Home News, a newspaper that served the Philadelphia neighborhoods of Fairmount, Brewerytown and Francisville for over 70 years. In 2015, Oordt and Broad Street Media purchased Philadelphia Weekly and the South Philly Review. The deal was finalized on Monday, Feb. 2, 2015. Although under the same ownership group, Philadelphia Weekly and the South Philly Review operate under R.P.M.

All City Paper editorial staff positions were eliminated, and the closure of the paper caused some controversy due to the fact that editors and reporters learned the news only after a press release was issued to other media outlets. Broad Street Media's headquarters are located at 3412 Progress Drive in the suburban Bucks County town of Bensalem, Pa., with an additional offices in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, as well as 1617 JFK Blvd. (Philadelphia Weekly) and 12th and Porter streets (South Philly Review) in Philadelphia. =Other interests In the 1990s, Oordt developed a successful breeding operation for Tennessee Walking show horses.

While serving as headmaster of a boarding school run by his Order, he took in several Jewish refugees to protect them from the Nazi government of occupation, for which he was arrested and imprisoned in various Nazi concentration camps. P√®re Jacques was one of those who undertook efforts to help Jewish people during the Nazi occupation of France. His efforts were ultimately unsuccessful, resulting in his death at Linz, Austria, after having suffered in the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp complex in 1945, weeks after its liberation by Allied Forces. Pere Jacques was named one of the \\"Righteous Among the Nations\\" by the State of Israel in 1985, as a non-Jew who risked his life during the Holocaust to save Jews. French film-maker Louis Malle paid tribute to P√®re Jacques, who was his primary school headmaster, in the 1987 film Au revoir les enfants. The cause for his canonization by the Catholic Church was opened in 1990. Biography Born Lucien Bunel in Normandy in 1900, he was inspired by his father's example deep piety and social service to study for the Catholic priesthood. He was ordained in 1925 to serve the Diocese of Rouen. After his ordination, he quickly became a noted preacher, as well as being a successful teacher. He also maintained a deep interior life of prayer. Bunel had considered becoming a Trappist monk before his ordination, and still sought some way of integrating his being drawn to an intense life of prayer, combined with service to others. When he came to know the Discalced Carmelite nuns at Le Havre, he found a spiritual tradition which answered his quest. He entered the Order in Lille in 1930 and given the religious name by which he is now known. While he was preparing for his final profession of religious vows in 1934, the superiors of the Order suggested that he consider opening a school for boys. This was accomplished by him with the opening of the Petit Coll√®ge Sainte-Th√©r√®se de l‚ÄôEnfant-J√©sus in Avon, Seine-et-Marne, that same year, of which he served as headmaster. The friar served at the school until the outbreak of World War II, when he was conscripted for service in the French Army. When France surrendered to Germany the following June, he was released from military service. He returned to the school but became an active member of the French Resistance. As headmaster, Father Jacques utilized the best tool available to him. He made the boys‚Äô school a refuge for young men seeking to avoid conscription for forced labor in Germany and for Jews. In January 1943, he enrolled three Jewish boys ‚Äî Hans-Helmut Michel, Jacques-France Halpern and Maurice Schlosser ‚Äî as students, under false names. He also hid a fourth Jewish boy, Maurice Bas, as a worker at the school; sheltered Schlosser‚Äôs father with a local villager; and placed a noted Jewish botanist, Lucien Weil, on the faculty of the school. The Gestapo discovered Father Jacques‚Äô activities and seized the friar and the three Jewish students on January 15, 1944. Weil, his mother, and sister were arrested at their home that same day. On February 3, 1944, German authorities deported the boys and the Weil family to Auschwitz, where they died. P√®re Jacques was imprisoned in several Nazi concentration camps, eventually arriving at the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp. There he found ways of raising the morale of his despairing compatriots. When all the priests at Gusen were moved to the Dachau concentration camp - reputedly less severe than Mauthausen - Jacques veiled his priestly identity and was the only priest for 20,000 prisoners at Gusen. He learned enough Polish to minister to the Polish prisoners, who called him P√®re Zak. Though he grew progressively weaker, he remained one of the Resistance leaders still active in the camp, gaining the respect of all its inmates. He and the other inmates of the camps were liberated by American troops at Mauthausen in early May 1945. Suffering from tuberculosis and weighing only 75 pounds (34 kg), he died in a hospital in Linz in Upper Austria, several weeks later. Yad Vashem In 1985 the Israeli Holocaust remembrance center, Yad Vashem, honoured P√®re Jacques as one of the \\"Righteous Among the Nations\\" for his efforts in hiding Jewish students at his Catholic boarding school.  Au revoir les enfants  The film Au revoir les enfants was a film made and directed by Louis Malle in 1987, a student who at the age of 11 attended P√®re Jacques' school and witnessed his arrest. The film is about what happened that day and the weeks before, but is set in another school with different characters.

The petals of the solitary, white flowers are fused at the base to form a tube in length and have six lobes. =Gallery= File:Gardenia brighamii (5187430581).jpg Fruits File:Gardenia brighamii (5187430869).jpg Flowers File:Gardenia brighamii (5188030936).jpg Leaves File:Gardenia brighamii (4756682758).jpg Bark File:Gardenia brighamii - Koko Crater Botanical Garden - IMG 2258.JPG Plant Habitat and range Forest gardenia inhabits tropical dry forests at elevations of . It previously could be found on all main islands, but today populations only exist on Maui, Molokai, Oahu, and LƒÅnai, and the Big Island. Conservation The total population of G. brighamii is between 15 and 19 trees. There are only two plants in the wild on Oahu and one on the Big Island. Major threats to the survival of this species include loss of dry forest habitat and the establishment of invasive species, such as fountain grass (Pennisetum setaceum). Uses Native Hawaiians made kua kuku (kapa anvils) and pou (house posts) from the wood of nƒÅn≈´. A yellow kapa dye was derived from the fruit pulp. The white, fragrant flowers are used in lei.
