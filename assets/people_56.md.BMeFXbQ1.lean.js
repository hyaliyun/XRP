Trump is a lawsuit filed on November 13, 2018, in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The plaintiffs are the Cable News Network (CNN) and their chief White House correspondent Jim Acosta, and the defendants are members of the Donald Trump administration and United States Secret Service. Citing Sherrill v. Knight, Pursuing America‚Äôs Greatness v. Federal Election Commission, and Elrod v. Burns,See court filing. the suit argued that the White House wrongfully revoked Acosta's press credentials in violation of the First Amendment right to freedom of the press and Fifth Amendment right to due process, respectively; and, additionally citing federal regulations (namely, \\"Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(a) and Local Rule 65.1\\"), the suit successfully sought immediate relief from damage to CNN and Acosta by way of a temporary restraining order for the return of Acosta's press pass. CNN dropped the suit on November 19. Background On November 7, 2018, the day after the midterm elections, President Trump held a press conference at the White House. CNN White House Correspondent Jim Acosta asked President Trump about his use of the word invasion to describe the Central American migrant caravans. Trump then answered he wants the immigrants to come in legally and argued with Acosta about his position on the issue. While asking his follow-up question, Trump refused to answer and cut Acosta off, by stating \\"Honestly, I think you should let me run the country, you run CNN, and if you did it well, your ratings would be much better\\" before signaling to a White House intern to take the microphone, and calling on someone else. Acosta then refused to give up the mic and tried to ask a question regarding the Special Counsel investigation into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections, but Trump repeated \\"That's enough\\" three more times before the intern tried to take the microphone from him. Acosta resisted, and Trump followed by telling Acosta to \\"put down the mic.\\" After, when the intern took the microphone and gave it to another reporter, Acosta sat down, and Trump said \\"CNN should be ashamed of itself having you working for them. You are a rude, terrible person. You shouldn't be working for CNN.\\" Trump then claimed Acosta has mistreated Sarah Sanders in the past. After Trump began taking questions from another reporter who came to Acosta's defense and Trump claimed to not like either, Acosta then stood back up and mentioned that CNN was sent pipe bombs by a Trump supporter, to which Trump replied \\"When you report fake news, which CNN does a lot, you are the enemy of the people\\". Later that day while he attempted to do a live report outside the White House, an unidentified Secret Service agent confiscated Acosta's press pass. Acosta recorded the incident on his cell phone, saying \\"This is Jim Acosta. I am in front of the White House. Secret Service officer is asking for my hard pass. Obviously, no hard feelings to the officer, but I am now giving my hard pass to the Secret Service.\\" CNN journalist Jim Acosta banned from White House after Trump calls him 'rude, terrible person' NBC News, November 7, 2018White House suspends credentials for CNN correspondent Jim Acosta after heated exchange with Trump ABC News, November 7, 2018 The next day, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders defended their actions, claiming Acosta had \\"placed his hands\\" on the intern.

On Friday, November 16, Judge Kelly ordered that Acosta's press pass be restored for 14 days. The judge said in his ruling that Acosta was deprived of his Fifth Amendment rights of due process, because Acosta had not been given prior notice or the chance to rebut. Judge Kelly declined to rule on the First Amendment claim. In response, Press Secretary Huckabee Sanders claimed the court made it clear there was no First Amendment right to access the White House, although Judge Kelly had stated the ruling did not address questions about First Amendment issues.

It was designed by William Henry Foggitt and built in 1921 by J. McCarthy. It is also known as NSW Housing Board Building (former) and NSW Housing Board Building; Charlotte House. The property is owned by Property NSW, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002.  History  This building was originally erected for the NSW Housing Board, a body set up in April 1912 and coming under the control of the Colonial Secretary. The contract for construction of the building was let to J. McCarthy on 1 April 1921 at a cost of . The architect was William Henry Foggitt, the Housing Board's architect and it was opened in late 1921. The building was occupied by the following government bodies: * The NSW Housing Board * The Resumed Properties Department * The Grain Elevation Construction Branch * The Department of Agriculture * The Prisons Department, occupied the building from 1930 and eventually took over occupancy from earlier occupants. In 1974 the Police Department occupied the building but thus far it is unknown whether they remained there until 1983 when The Rocks Police moved into the former ASN Hotel Building on the corner of George and Harrington Streets. The building was originally under the control of the NSW Housing Board, but in 1927 it passed to the Sydney Harbour Trust, then to the Maritime Services Board newly set up in December 1935. In 1970 the building was vested in the Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority.SCRA 1982: GL/01 Archaeology notes: Covers most of grant to Thomas Bray and Edward McRoberts, trustees of will of Alexander Ikin;Lot 15, Section 64 and all of grant to Christopher Crane of Castlereagh Street, 30 November 1840.Lot 16, Section 64  Description  Style: Severe; Storeys: Four. The building sits solidly and prominently on the corner and is a simple building of the Inter-War period, displaying limited features of the Inter-war Stripped Classical style. The brick and stone entry portal on Grosvenor Street is the most decorative feature externally. The interiors partitions have been built in line with original design intent, and some original features remain. Completed in 1921, the building is constructed of exposed dark brick on three main levels plus basement with access onto Gloucester Street which is the lowest frontage. The brickwork is laid in English Bond relieved by a modicum of stone dressing, both ashlar and attenuated pitch faced, used for ground level quoins and the Grosvenor Street central frontispiece. A further relief to this rather severe building is provided by rendered lintels and continuous frieze. An extra storey was constructed circa the late 1930s to a coherent design although the window sashes and sill bricks differ. = Condition = As at 15 April 2000, the building is in excellent condition.Wyborn, P., 1999. Archaeology assessment Condition: Partly disturbed. Assessment Basis: Terraced into hill slope. = Modifications and dates = *Major refurbishment.  Heritage listing  As at 26 June 2002, 16-18 Grosvenor Street, The Rocks and its site are of State significance for historic social and aesthetic reasons as a purpose built headquarters for the Resumed Properties Department and as an important contributor to The Rocks townscape. The building has historic significance because it was built to house the Resumed Properties Department, responsible for the resumption of land for the Department of Lands, and which played a major part in reshaping The Rocks and Millers Point. The building was in continuous government ownership and occupation from 1922 until the present. In the early years it was occupied by various government departments including: The Grain Elevation Construction Branch - The Department of Agriculture - The Prisons Department - The Police Department - and the Maritime Services Board. The building, built in 1921, is of aesthetic significance for its robust load bearing masonry character, strongly defining the corner, and displaying some key features of the Inter-War stripped classical style. Significant features include the decorative entry portal, dark brick banding, and bracketed render cornice. The interior retains most of the significant original features and although it has later partition walling it has been constructed such that it could be easily removed to restore the spaces and the original design intent. The structure has social significance as it is the last known purpose built government building built in the 1920s remaining on a corner allotment with three facades.HBO+EMTB Heritage Pty Ltd. 2007 NSW Housing Board Building was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The site of 16-18 Grosvenor Street, The Rocks has historical significance as it illustrates evolutional significance of the urban development of The Rocks area. In particular the site has undergone a number of boundary realignments including the urban renewal after the bubonic plague and then the realignment of the streets with the construction of the Harbour Bridge. The site boundaries have changed several times during the early development of the site, but not since 1921. The building was constructed as part of an important development for the NSW Government as the head office for the Resumed Properties Department, which was responsible for the resumption of land for the Lands Department. The building and site meet this criterion at State level. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The building at 16-18 Grosvenor Street, The Rocks has associational significance due to its early occupation by the Resumed Properties Department head office, which was associated with the administrative resumption of land for the Lands Department. The building also has associational significance with the building's architect W. H. Foggitt who was once assistant Principal Architect of Public Works, and later State Architect and Architect to the Housing Board who drew up plans for the first stage of housing for Daceyville Garden an experimental public housing scheme . The building also has an association with the administration of government through its early occupation by a number of other State instrumentalities. The building meets this criterion at Local level. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. 16-18 Grosvenor Street, The Rocks, has aesthetic and technical significance. The building is one of the few places in the vicinity not impacted as a result of the construction of the Harbour Bridge in 1932. The building possesses characteristics of the Inter war stripped classical style, although its ability to demonstrate this style was to a degree reduced when its brick parapet was replaced by construction of a rather bland upper level in the 1930s. The load bearing brick construction, exemplified by the use of piers as a means of modulating the facades. The building acts as a marker for The Rocks precinct due to its prominence on the corner allotment of Grosvenor Street, Cumberland and Gloucester Streets and frontage along three street fronts. The building has a strong visual presence in the streetscape providing a framing element in the vista of the Central Business District at the Harbour Bridge approach. The building meets this criterion at local level. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The building at 16-18 Grosvenor Street, The Rocks has important social associations for the State and the local community due to its role as headquarters for the Resumed Properties Department and to house other government departments including: Agriculture, Prisons and for a short time Government Housing Office. The building meets this criterion at State level providing evidence of government practices through the middle of the twentieth century. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The site at 16-18 Grosvenor Street, The Rocks, does not meet this criteria. The ground plane was last disturbed in 1921 due to the construction of the building. Little to no archaeological evidence would remain below ground level. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The building at 16-18 Grosvenor Street has the potential to demonstrate rare aspects of early twentieth century government administration particularly because it still remains intact. The building, is the only known example of an early purpose built government building from the Inter-war period to have three frontages, remaining in The Rocks precinct. The building meets this criterion at local level. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The building at 16-18 Grosvenor Street, The Rocks represents an important phase in the historic development of The Rocks area and of government administrative buildings. The fa√ßade demonstrates qualities that are typical of the Stripped Classical architecture of the Interwar period and although modifications have been carried out to the interiors, evidence of the style is consistent throughout. It is a good example of the use of load bearing brickwork imparting a robust character with restrained use of sandstone and render detailing. The building is an example of its period where importance was given to the construction of purpose built government administrative buildings. The building meets this criterion at State level.

These agreements were known as Privilegium or \\"Privileges.\\" In 1873, twelve Mennonite delegates from southern Russia set out to North America to investigate new lands. Of the 12 delegates, four decided to accept Canada's offer of land in the newly formed province of Manitoba.

The Privilegium was referred to by Canadian Mennonites to defend their right to be Conscientious Objectors during both World War I and World War II.

Plato and Aristotle, School of Athens. Raffaello Sanzio.  Aesthetics Definition and History  Aesthetics is defined as the perception of art, design or beauty. Aesthetics is derived from the Greek word \\"aisthetikos\\" defined as a perception of the senses. In aesthetics, there is a process of individual analysis, perception and imagination. Perception is defined as an individual's neurophysiological process of awareness and interpreting external stimuli. Therefore, aesthetics is highly subjective and differs by individual. Aesthetics can also be used as a synonym to define taste or style encapsulating artistic expression and activities such as rhetoric, tone, harmony, painting, composition art and music. Aesthetics also encapsulates the look, feel, or sound of natural forms. Aesthetics also encompasses the science of how an individual or a society perceives, feels, senses or knows an external stimuli. As a philosophy, aesthetics was developed in 18th century Germany by Emmanuel Kant. However, Greek and Roman philosophers such as Aristotle and Plato engaged in the rhetorical debate of aesthetic perception and properties as a separate branch of philosophy in defining the parameters of art and beauty. Ancient aesthetics shows the origin of aesthetic debate and influences modern aesthetic definitions.

He was very successful in business as a young man, purchased large quantities of land in the Michigan Territory in the early 1830s, founded the town of Comstock, Michigan, and served multiple terms in the Michigan Legislature. He built a reputation as a generous and helpful citizen, but following the death of his first wife, his family began to fall apart and his finances suffered, and he died intestate with little of his fortune left. His first wife was the niece of author James Fenimore Cooper, whose time spent at Comstock's house in Kalamazoo, Michigan, helped inspire his novel The Oak Openings. Comstock's son Bill Comstock became a frontier scout who worked under General George A. Custer and gained fame for losing a buffalo-shooting contest with Buffalo Bill Cody over the right to use the nickname \\"Buffalo\\".  Biography  Horace Hawkins Comstock was born about 1807 to William Comstock and Frieda Hawkins, of Laurens, New York. His father was an affluent member of the community and had reached the rank of general in the area militia. Comstock studied law and went into the Indian Trade between Chicago and Detroit, and by the age of 25 he had amassed a fortune. He began to buy up large quantities of cheap land in the Michigan Territory beginning in 1831; he labored on the land himself, unlike some speculators, and was known to be helpful and generous with those around him. People throughout the area called him General Comstock, though he did not have a military background himself. His fortune at the time was said to be $60,000 (). He established the village of Comstock, Michigan, where he built a gristmill, ran a store, and acted as the postmaster. When he built a schoolhouse, the people of the area named the surrounding township Comstock Township after him. He built warehouses and docks along the Kalamazoo River in an attempt to turn the village into a trading center, and undertook an unsuccessful campaign to have it named the seat of Kalamazoo County, even though the town of Kalamazoo had already been selected. = Business with James Fenimore Cooper = On November 7, 1833, Comstock married Sarah Sabina Cooper in Cooperstown, New York. She was the daughter of Isaac Cooper, brother of the author James Fenimore Cooper. The Comstocks had a daughter, Sarah Sabina, who was born in Cooperstown the following year. While his wife was in Cooperstown, Comstock built a large home in Michigan for them, called Comstock Hall. Not long after she joined him, the neighboring township was renamed Cooper Township, Michigan, after her. While he was visiting Cooperstown in June 1834, James Fenimore Cooper met Comstock, who he found to be a \\"respectable young man\\". Comstock persuaded him to invest in land as equal partners with him, though Cooper was putting up all the capital, in the form of a $6,000 line of credit he obtained in May 1835 from City Bank of New York, secured with personal notes from Gorham A. Worth and Cooper's partner in the cotton business, James D. P. Ogden. By that October, Cooper wanted out of the deal, due to financial pressure from losses on cotton, but Comstock persuaded him to let Comstock buy Cooper out in installments over fifteen months. In 1836, Comstock paid the first two of the four notes he had given Cooper. Short of hard cash for the remaining two, he substituted a mortgage of Michigan banker Sidney Ketchum's that he held. As Ketchum's own financial fortunes faded, he in turn substituted additional instruments that blurred the responsibility for the debt to the point that Comstock and Cooper spent many years in court trying to recover their money. Cooper was partially successful in this, though by the time of his death in 1851, he had still not recovered all of what he was owed. These legal battles required Cooper to make five trips to Michigan beginning in June 1847, including three visits to Kalamazoo to check on a number of properties that Comstock had transferred to him in 1841 as partial repayment. The information he gathered about the Midwest and the Kalamazoo area helped Cooper formulate the new novel he began in 1848, The Oak Openings, which was set in the area around Kalamazoo. = Political career = The residents of Michigan Territory approved a state constitution in 1835, hoping to force Congress to act on their desire for statehood. Statehood did not come until 1837, but an election for a new state legislature was held in 1835 in any case. Comstock was elected as a Democrat to represent Kalamazoo County in the new Michigan Senate, and was re-elected twice, serving four years in total. Despite losing out to Kalamazoo as the county seat, he promised to loan that city $6,000 () in 1836 in order to build a courthouse. But he invested $17,000 () in a one-quarter interest in the property covered by the city's plat the following year, and after the Panic of 1837 and the ensuing collapse of land prices, he was unable to follow through. In 1839, he was appointed a general in the state militia, in command of a division. = Decline and death = From 1840 to 1844, Comstock served as the supervisor of Comstock Township, and he and Sarah had three more children, Julia Hamilton, William Averill, and Frances Oathwaite. Comstock moved his family into a mansion in Kalamazoo. Sarah Comstock died on February 15, 1846, and Comstock's finances and personal life began to suffer irreparably. He moved to Otsego, Michigan, in 1848, and was elected for one term in the Michigan House of Representatives in 1849. He married 17-year-old Betsey Belcher on July 16, 1849, and the following year moved back to Ossining, New York. He married a third time, to Elizabeth Graves, who died at Ossining on June 6, 1860, and he remarried again, to a woman named Catherine. Comstock himself died at Ossining on March 15, 1861; he was intestate, and his brother Daniel petitioned to become executor of the estate, which he estimated to be less than $1,000 (). = Family = Following his wife Sarah's death in 1846, Comstock sent his children to life with relatives, and put one up for adoption, before moving back to New York. Sabina, the eldest daughter, was sent to live with a widowed aunt in Whitewater, Wisconsin. Julia remained in Otsego with Comstock's second wife Betsey, who herself lived with her parents, before returning to Cooperstown. Frances, or Fannie, was adopted by a Kalamazoo stageline operator named Bissel Humphrey. Will lived briefly with his uncles in Corning, New York, before being adopted by a family in Wisconsin. The family moved to Kansas, where Bill Comstock, as he became known, grew into a sought-after frontier scout. General George A. Custer specifically requested his services, and he worked for a time alongside Wild Bill Hickock for Custer's 7th Cavalry. He also became known for losing to Buffalo Bill Cody in the buffalo-shooting contest the two held to determine the right to use that nickname. He was killed on August 16, 1868, while trying to negotiate peace with a Cheyenne chief named Turkey Leg during the violence that followed a raid on Saline Valley the previous week.

Life  Born in Normandy in 1957, Moutier explored the piano at the age of four, with a mother who loved literature and a father - a graduate of the Van Der Kelen Institute - who was passionate about painting and architecture. Noticed by Tasso Janopoulo (partner of Jacques Thibaud), he immersed himself in the world of poetic song from the Paris of the sixties. At the age of eleven, he played at the Th√©√¢tre des Champs-√âlys√©es with the Orchestre national d'√éle-de-France and then with the Orchestre national de France. Received at thirteen years old at the Conservatoire de Paris (piano and chamber music, writing), Moutier first studied with Lucette Descaves. She passed on to him the heritage of Yves Nat, her knowledge of French music, and invited him to work as closely as possible with living composers. He explored the repertoire of chamber music with Jean Hubeau and Genevi√®ve Joy-Dutilleux. After his First Prizes, he was received in a cycle of improvement where Reine Gianoli introduced him to the universe of Robert Schumann and transmitted to him her attachment - received from Edwin Fischer - to the work of Johann Sebastian Bach. She presented him to Paul Badura-Skoda. The meetings with Gy√∂rgy Seb≈ëk, Dmitri Bashkirov, then work with many conductors and composers determined his future. A laureate of the Cleveland International Piano Competition, and Long-Thibaud-Crespin Competition, he was received on the day of his nineteenth birthday as a solo performer at Radio France. He was requested by Aldo Ciccolini to assist him at the Conservatoire de Paris where he became the youngest permanent teacher at the age of 22. Elected to the conservatory's bodies, he was involved in the reflection concerning the transfer of the establishment to the Cit√© de la Musique. Professor and keyboard coordinator at the , Moutier then took over the direction of the Conservatory of Maisons-Alfort for seven years, where he gathered the teaching team around the link between education and culture, essential for the development of the child, and led the musical programming of the Theatre and the library in the same city. He returned to higher education in 1997 as a permanent professor at the Conservatoire national sup√©rieur de musique et de danse de Lyon where he founded and developed the keyboard department. He participates in major academies in Europe and Asia, is a guest in master classes at major universities and conservatories where he tirelessly encourages young musicians in their vocation and their need to share, often to the best international awards. Several first prizes in the Orl√©ans Piano XXth century International Competition (including Florence Cioccolani,Florence Cioccolani Wilhem Latchoumia, Maroussia Gentet),Maroussia Genter on France Musique from his class at the CNSMD in Lyon, illustrate his commitment to contemporary creation. His concerts have taken him to Rome (notably to the Villa M√©dicis), Prague, Moscow, Budapest, Vienna, Montreal, Seoul, etc. Moutier shared the stage with G√©rard Jarry, Olivier Charlier, Rapha√´l Oleg, Boris Garlitsky, Amy Flammer,Ami Flammer on Conservatoire de Paris Roland Daugareil,Roland Daugareil on France Info Laurent Korcia, Dong-Suk Kang, G√©rard Poulet, Tasso Adamopoulos, Bruno Pasquier, Pierre-Henri Xuereb, Michel Michalakakos, , Roland Pidoux, Philippe Muller, Alain Meunier, Jacques Di Donato, Alain Marion, Vincent Lucas, Philippe Pierlot, and with the Rosamonde, Ludwig and Castagneri string quartets. On 1 September 2009, Moutier was appointed director of the Conservatoire national sup√©rieur musique et danse de Lyon, establishment he will leave after three successive terms. While putting training by the stage at the heart of the curriculum he developed the Doctorate of Music Research and Practice, the international programs of artistic creation InMics and CoPeCO, numerous professional production and distribution partnerships (major festivals, orchestras, opera, companies, creation centres, CCN, Biennales), the renewal of musical and stage creation forms with other art schools (, Ensbal, Ensal, ), and deep, intellectual and practical links with leading scientific and social science schools (co-founder of the CHELS with ENS, Sciences-Po, Ecole Centrale, ).

It was designed by George McRae and built from 1912 to 1913. It is also known as Chung Lun Building and (erroneously) the Housing Board Building. The property is owned by Property NSW, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002.  History =Frog Hollow= Frog Hollow, pictured in 1901, prior to resumption and demolition There is a considerable height difference between Harrington and Gloucester Streets and for the entire nineteenth century there were no buildings with a Gloucester Street frontage at the northern end of the block; rather single- and two-storey buildings were located in the hollow below, which became known as Frog Hollow. The housing in Frog Hollow was of a much lower standard than the terrace that developed fronting Harrington Street. These buildings had no street access other than via stairs and passageways. Frog Hollow contained 12 dwellings of which ten were identical in plan, containing a single room on the ground floor, with a fireplace, and a single room above. The front door opened directly into the ground floor room and the staircase was located along the back wall. Of the remaining three dwellings, one was of the same type, but extended considerably and a second was a single-storey block containing three rooms. The residences in Frog Hollow and lining Harrington Street were all tenanted. It was a characteristic of The Rocks that the lower-standard accommodation was in the back lanes, with a higher quality of house fronting the streets. By the mid 1880s a set of stairs had been built from the corner of Essex Street leading down into Frog Hollow. These passages and steps provided the only access to the houses in Frog Hollow. By 1900 the buildings in Frog Hollow were the property of Peter Francis Hart (1840-1917). Hart, a builder and contractor, had served as the Alderman for the Gipps Ward of the Council of the City of Sydney from 1883 until 1899. Despite his ownership of properties later condemned, Hart appears to have been interested in urban improvements, serving on various Council committees including the Refuse Committee, the Specifications and Tenders Committee, the Heights of Buildings Committee and the Electric Lighting Committee. Hart had other properties in the vicinity, and Harts Buildings (now Hart's pub) at 10-14 Essex Street built in the 1890s still bear his name. =Resumption, demolition and redevelopment= Following the outbreak of bubonic plague in December 1900, an extensive cleansing of the perceived slum areas was undertaken and the entire area from Millers Point, where the outbreak occurred, as far south as Charlotte Place (Grosvenor Street) was resumed by the state, under the Public Works Act. It is no wonder that the group of dwellings in Frog Hollow was condemned, as the record plan shows that for the 12 dwellings there were only three privies. One dwelling had a designated kitchen, although one of the ground floor rooms of the house in the middle of the group is also likely to have served as a kitchen. The remainder of the houses had one room on the ground floor which was used as combined kitchen and living room. There were no bathrooms. Frog Hollow was demolished between November 1901 and April 1905. The irregular allotments at the intersection of Gloucester and Essex Streets were regularised and 20 new lots created, each with a street frontage. A survey was undertaken in April 1905 and the first \\"auction sale of the Observatory Hill lands\\" occurred on 4 December 1905. Drawings for a building on the corner site were prepared by the Government Architect's Branch under the jurisdiction of George McRae, dated 28 February 1909 and designated as a \\"Factory and Dwelling\\". The factory was designed with the health of the workers in mind, providing natural light, fireproof construction and a staff dining room. No. 120 Gloucester Street is the only surviving example of a model factory within the resumed areas. The structure contained storage space in the basement level, warehousing on the ground floor, workrooms on the first floor, and a three-bedroom flat on the second floor. A letter to the town clerk written in 1911 refers to the \\"new factory at 120 Gloucester Street\\". Council's rate book for the Gipps Ward for the years 1911-1913 notes that a store and factory at 120 Gloucester St was rated to Chung Lun and owned by the Government of NSW (Rocks Resumptions). Chung Lun previously held premises at 28-30 Essex Street, operating as \\"soft- goods warehousemen\\". Chung Lun continued his links with 120 Gloucester Street until 1926. The building was then rated to Ella Beatrice Steward who operated the refreshment rooms until the mid-1940s. In a document dated 30 March 2011, the NSW Office of Environment and Heritage incorrectly named the building at 120 Gloucester Street \\"the Housing Board Building\\". This seems to result from its confusion with another building in The Rocks built to house the Resumed Properties section of the Department of Public Works which was located at No. 16-18 Grosvenor Street, namely the NSW Housing Board Building in Grosvenor Street. =Developments since the 1990s= The building continued to function as a shop and residence until when it was used as a site office for the construction of the \\"Quay West\\" apartment building on the opposite side of Essex Street. In 1997 builder, R. E. Charles Constructions Pty Ltd was engaged to undertake repair and maintenance works at 120 Gloucester St which amounted to $26,359. Work continued into 1998 on the roof of the building. In December 2003 the NSW Heritage Council approved a development application for the upgrading of the building and its combination with the adjoining building at 117-119 Harrington Street. The proposal was prepared by the architect, John Graham & Associates. These plans were used as a basis to attract expressions of interest for the conservation and adaptive re-use of the building to be funded by the future developer/occupant of the building in return for a long lease to the building. In June 2004 title to the building was transferred from the Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority to the Sydney Harbour Foreshore Authority. In 2005 a revised development application was lodged by HEG Holdings Pty Ltd which was prepared by architects, Noosphere Ideas Pty Ltd. whilst combining the buildings at 120 Gloucester and 117-119 Harrington Streets, the revised proposal deleted the already approved new top floor to 117-119 Harrington Street and substituted a two-storey, lightweight penthouse of unambiguously modern design. The 1950 lift shaft and stairs were retained in their original location within 117-119 Harrington Street. The 2006 work uncovered a severely deteriorated interior to 120 Gloucester Street. Application was sought and approval given to vary the conditions of consent so that the interior timbers could be removed and replaced with new timbers. This work necessitated the gutting of the building back to its masonry walls. All the original internal fabric was lost including timber floor structure and flooring, timber staircase, corrugated metal ceilings, internal non-masonry walls, etc. In addition the roof top laundry and chimneys were also lost along with the roof structure. The parapet along the east side of the building adjoining 117-119 Harrington Street was demolished so that the terrace area of the penthouse at 117-119 Harrington Street could be extended over part of the roof area of 120 Gloucester Street. This work was carried out in 2006. In 2005 a 99-year lease was signed with HEG Holdings Pty Ltd who developed the building project and in 2006 the lease was transferred to the current lessee, Downey Day Walden. 117-119 Harrington Street is now known as Dawnay Day House and is the Australian headquarters of the Dawnay Day Group. In addition to containing the offices of Dawnay Day Walden, the combined building of 117-119 Harrington Street and 120 Gloucester Street contains the offices of various tenants which are accessed from the four entrances to the combined buildings. The four entrances are located at 117-119 Harrington Street, 7 Essex Street, 5 Essex Street and 120 Gloucester Street.Adapted from Robertson & Hindmarsh P/L, 2008 Archaeology notes: Site of Frog Hollow (reputation for being a slum), demolished . Housing board erected the current shop/ dwelling/ warehouse in 1909.  Description  Located on the corner of Essex and Gloucester Streets, the site falls from west to east. The building is adjoined at the east by Accountants House. Situated to the immediate south is the Bushells Building. The Model Factory building is a fine example of the Federation Arts and Crafts style, which is characterised by the integration of face-brick and roughcast detailing to external walls and the decorative design of the parapet walls. It contains a basement, ground floor, two upper floors, and a flat trafficable roof. Construction comprises a steel frame with timber frame floors, and load- bearing masonry walls.Howard 1994: 38 Style: Federation Arts and Crafts; Storeys: 3; Facade: red-brown face brick laid in English bond; Internal walls: load-bearing masonry walls; Roof cladding: membrane with a protective layer of pebbles; Floor frame: timber. = Condition = Archaeology Assessment Condition : Mostly disturbed.

The addition of the penthouse to the roof of 117-119 Harrington Street alters the view and appreciation of the building looking east down Essex Street. The tiling around the Essex Street entry to the lowest floor and the subsequent removal of the tiles (leaving a cement rendered area) impacts on the integrity of the Essex Street fa√ßade. The interior structure of mild steel stanchion and mild steel main beam remains but all the timber joists and flooring have been removed and replaced. Interior wall and floor tiling and all the sanitary fixtures have been removed.Robertson & Hindmarsh P/L 2008  Heritage listing  As at 30 March 2011, the NSW Housing Board Building and site are of State heritage significance for their historical and scientific cultural values. The site and building are also of State heritage significance for their contribution to The Rocks area which is of State Heritage significance in its own right. The Model Factory and Workers Dwelling at 120 Gloucester Street, The Rocks and site is of State heritage significance for its historical, aesthetic and scientific cultural values. The site and building are also of State heritage significance for their contribution to The Rocks area which is of State Heritage significance in its own right. The building and site demonstrate the attempt by the State Government to regularise, and plan in an orderly manner, the layout of streets and buildings in The Rocks following the early twentieth-century resumption, re-subdivision and building renewal of The Rocks undertaken under the guidance of the NSW Government Architect Walter Liberty Vernon. It is one of the buildings constructed during the first stage of the urban renewal, constructed prior to World War I. Two of the Government Architects Branch's most prominent architects, George McRae and Edward Drew, were involved with this design. The building demonstrates a novel, rare design of a model factory and dwelling designed by the State Government to improve the living standards and health of the working population. The model factory and the adjacent park predates the surviving garden factories in Australia which were modelled, in turn, on Port Sunlight and Bourneville in England and is unusual in that it was constructed amidst an existing urban area. This design shows the NSW Government Architect's long-standing interest in workers' housing and the improvement of the urban environment. The scale, form, use of materials and detailing of the building makes a positive contribution to the intact 19th and early 20th century streetscapes of the Gloucester, Harrington, and Essex Street precinct. 120 Gloucester Street, The Rocks has a high level of aesthetic significance as an early example of a Federation Free Style factory. Designed by the NSW Government Architects Branch who pioneered the Free Style in NSW and erected in 1910-1911 the building reflects architectural trends in London. The purity of detailing is strongly exemplified by the integration of face brick and roughcast, and the strongly curved parapet walls, employing a palette of materials widely used in model workers' housing in England and in Australia. The model factory and dwelling is a complete contrast to the slum dwellings in Frog Hollow that it replaced and was constructed of \\"fire proof\\" materials with good ventilation and light levels, evidence of which survives. Within the output of the Government Architect's Branch this is a rare building type and is the only known factory and dwelling building designed to be leased. The record drawings and photographs of the substandard buildings in Frog Hollow and their demolition provide an insight into the slum dwellings owned by city aldermen that were concealed in the back lanes. Housing Board Building was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Housing Board Building and site are of State heritage significance for their historical and scientific cultural values. The site and building are also of State heritage significance for their contribution to The Rocks area which is of State Heritage significance in its own right. The building and site demonstrate the attempt by the State Government to regularise, and plan in an orderly manner, the layout of streets and buildings in The Rocks following the early twentieth century resumption, re-subdivision and building renewal of The Rocks. The building is a rare example in the New South Wales context of a Free Style factory building that embodies the utopian principles of the Arts and Crafts Movement. The building is a rare example of a model factory and dwelling constructed by the State Government and the only known example intended to be leased. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The building is associated with the senior designers of the Government Architect's Branch of the NSW Department of Public Works: Edward Drew and George McRae. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The building has aesthetic significance as a rare example in the New South Wales context of a Free Style factory, a style pioneered in NSW by the NSW Government Architect. The selection of Free Style for the urban renewal of The Rocks and Millers Point was modelled on the urban renewal in London being undertaken by the London County Council which the Government Architect had observed in 1897. The scale, form, use of materials and detailing of the building makes a positive contribution to the intact 19th and early 20th century streetscapes of the Gloucester, Harrington, and Essex Street precinct. The use of the combination of roughcast and face brick was prevalent in the design of workers' housing in England and in Australia. The building has technical significance in that the interior of the building was detailed to provide a \\"fireproof\\" form of construction with the steel column and beam in the front section of the building and the use of corrugated and pressed metal ceilings and stair soffits throughout the building. The building has technical significance in that the lower levels of the building were provided with through ventilation by means of shafts incorporated into the chimney breast which drew hot and stale air up to the roof level. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The building and site demonstrate the attempt by the State Government to regularise, and plan, in an orderly manner, the layout of streets and buildings in The Rocks following the early twentieth-century resumption, resubdivision and building renewal of The Rocks. It was a consciously designed environment, with well-designed factories and dwellings replacing the sub standard dwellings hidden in the back lanes. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The building is a rare example in the New South Wales context of the use of Free Style for a factory building and is of a very high quality of design. The building is a rare example in the New South Wales context of a model factory and dwelling constructed by the NSW State Government. It is an early example of a \\"garden factory\\", where landscaped parks or grounds were provided for the workers and it predates the series of garden factories modelled on the English examples of Port Sunlight and Bourneville that includes Raleigh Park at Kensington (Sydney), the Bryant and May factory at Richmond (Victoria) and on the Derwent River in Tasmania (Lutana and Claremont).

With over 65 theatre productions under the banner of The Mustard Seed Art Company, V√°s has written and directed a number of plays in English. She has primarily been an educator for more than 40 years now. She is the author of Frescoes in the Womb: Six Plays from Goa. She often features as a speaker at the Goa Arts and Literature Festival (GALF). Personal life Hailing from Aldona, she currently resides in Dona Paula, near the state's capital, Panaji. Career=Teaching= Currently a guest faculty at the Department of English, Goa University, V√°s lectures MA students on creative writing. Prior to this, she worked as the head of the English Department, Dhempe College of Arts and Science, Panaji, and retired after almost 40 years of service. Holding an MA degree and a PhD, she specialises in Drama, British and American Literature. =Theatre= In 1987, V√°s was approached by some students outside of school to help them in producing and performing plays. The result was an amateur theatre group, The Mustard Seed Art Company. Initially, her theatre group staged plays, based on social issues, by well-known playwrights. In 1992, she wrote and produced her first own original play, A Leaf in the Wind, after getting inspired by the hardships faced by her friend, Dominic D'Souza, Goa's first AIDS patient. She then started writing her own scripts, some of which were loosely based upon her own experiences: A Harvest of Gold (based on the exploitation of farmers), Who Killed the Ministers (a play about corruption in politics), Unmask the Mask (a play about social responsibility) and Little Boxes (a story about child labour). Her play, My Name is Goa, was performed entirely in mime, and touched upon alcoholism and the culture and history of Goa. Subsequently, she and the Company won a prize for her play, Who Sits Behind My Eyes. This play was about the life of a woman living in a fishing village, and reminded the modern generation to not forget or ignore its own traditions and community. It was inspired by a Tagore poem. In 2016, she wrote a play titled All Those Pipe Dreams, which revolved around a typically Goan family who had just bought and moved into an old mansion. In 2017, the group presented Hold Up the Sky, which was a fictional dramatisation on the life of Madame Mao, the wife of Chairman Mao Zedong of the Communist Party of China (in this work of historical fiction, she found her freedom in theatre). In 2018, she wrote the group's 66th play, Famous Nobodies. In this fictional play, museum exhibits of spouses of famous personalities from history strike up a conversation. It focused on individuals like Kasturba Gandhi, Eva Braun, Marilyn Monroe and the wife of the Pulitzer Prize winner Arthur Miller. Her Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) thesis, titled Performing Change: Theatre in the Context of Social Transformation in Three Asian Cultures in the Twentieth Century, explores theatre in China, India (specifically, West Bengal) and Sri Lanka from 1950 to 2000. =Other works= The 250th birth anniversary of Abb√© Faria, the noted Goan hypnotist, was celebrated in Candolim in 2006. For this occasion, V√°s made a video titled In Search of Abb√© Faria and wrote a dramatization on the life of Faria, titled Kator Re Bhaji (). She knows Portuguese language, culture and its theatre and has been featured as a guest speaker on the topic of theatre in Portuguese in 20th century Goa. She translated the play No Flowers, No Wreaths written by Orlando da Costa, current Portuguese Prime Minister Ant√≥nio Costa's late father, into English. In a ceremony, she was given the opportunity of personally presenting her translation of the work to the prime minister, who is of Goan origin. Community work Apart from theatre, V√°s has been actively involved in community work. =Positive People= She was a close friend of the late Dominic D'Souza, Goa's first documented AIDS patient (having worked with him on Mustard Seed plays). Together, they founded Positive People ‚Äî Goa's first counselling group, an NGO, to raise awareness on HIV/AIDS.

He used an early example of single-lens reflex camera, the 35 mm format Exakta, and the Contax 35mm rangefinder.

The picture was made in the year leading up to the Supreme Court (May 17, 1954) decision in Brown vs. Board of Education that abolished racial segregation in American schools. It shows two boys, one who is black with his arm over the shoulders of his companion who is white, walking in step past run-down shops. The taller boy delicately clasps a baseball card in his left hand, as if having just shown it to his friend. They are observed by an old white man sitting idly on a shop step clasping his walking-stick while another has his back turned to look at a cafe menu. The image is among a number of non-stereotypical images of black Americans at work and play in The Family of Man which curator Steichen chose to challenge and subvert racial stereotypes and demystify mainstream discourses on social and ethnic relations.Borgersen, T.

In the United States, financial privacy is regulated through laws enacted at the federal and state level. Federal regulations are primarily represented by the Bank Secrecy Act, Right to Financial Privacy Act, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, and the Fair Credit Reporting Act. Provisions within other laws like the Credit and Debit Card Receipt Clarification Act of 2007 as well as the Electronic Funds Transfer Act also contribute to financial privacy in the United States. State regulations vary from state to state. While each state approaches financial privacy differently, they mostly draw from federal laws and provide more stringent outlines and definitions. Government agencies like the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Federal Trade Commission provide enforcement for financial privacy regulations.  Federal laws = Right to Financial Privacy Act = The Right to Financial Privacy Act of 1978 (RFPA) was passed in 1978 primarily as a response to the Supreme Court ruling on United States v. Miller 1976 and to supplement the Bank Secrecy Act. The act was put in place to limit the government's ability to freely access nonpublic financial records. The RFPA defines financial institutions as any institution that engages in activities regarding banking, credit cards, and consumer finance. It also defines financial records as any documentation of a consumer's relationship with a financial institution. The act required that the U.S. government deliver a legal notice to a customer or receive consent from a customer before they can legally access their financial information. Customers must also be informed that they have the ability to challenge the government when the government is actively trying to access their financial information. In the event that the government successfully gains access to a customer's information, the government is not allowed to transfer the information between government agencies without clarifying that the information in question is being used in the name of law enforcement. The customer must be notified immediately if conditions are met and their information is going to be transferred between agencies. The Right to Financial Privacy Act included many exceptions to expedite federal investigations. Federal agencies can access any financial records if the records in question are connected to a law enforcement investigation. The act also gives any government department or agency the ability to request access to a customer's information. The government can access financial records through six exceptions: # Grand jury subpoena # Customer authorization giving consent # Administrative summons # Search warrant issued under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure # Judicial subpoena # Formal written request Any preexisting rules regarding search warrants are applied to the exceptions. When a search warrant for a customer's financial information is issued, the government has 90 days to inform the customer of the existence of the search warrant. A consumer can give permission to the government through written approval which allows the government access for a maximum of three months. At any given time, the consumer can void the approval. If the government is given access via approval, the financial institution holding the information must document which government agencies are given access. In the event that financial records are requested using an administrative summons, a judicial subpoena, or a formal written request, the government must notify the customer of what specific records are being requested, why they are being requested, and the procedures used to access the records. Financial institutions must verify that all laws, regulations, and procedures were followed before any financial records that were requested can be handed over to federal agencies. The RFPA was later amended to increase financial institutions' ability to help facilitate criminal investigations and prosecutions. Under the new amendments, financial institutions are allowed to disclose information to the government if they believe that a regulation has been violated. If an institution decides to share a customer's financial information this way, then the institution is only allowed to disclose information that identifies the suspect. The institution will also not be held liable for disclosing the information. The amendments also states that a court can compel a financial institution to notify a customer that their information has been subpoenaed.  Criticisms  Criticism has been directed at the written approval. The act never specifies if the customer is responsible for submitting the approval directly to the financial institution or if the government is responsible for only providing proof that a written approval has been submitted to them. = Gramm- Leach-Bliley Act = The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) was enacted in 1999 to repeal the Glass-Steagall Act. The repeal of Glass-Steagall allowed mergers between different types of financial institutions to occur, which enabled increased efficiency in the dissemination of financial information. To promote consumer privacy, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act included regulations to limit the ways in which companies handled and shared financial data. Protection of information is generally elaborated through three set rules in the act: # Financial institutions must create privacy policies, if one was not already in place, and inform customers of their policy # Financial institutions must specifically disclose to customers the conditions in which policy exceptions would allow financial information to be distributed to unaffiliated third parties # Financial institutions must give customers an \\"opt-out\\" option to allow customers the ability to prevent private information to be disclosed Despite the regulations put forth by GLBA, exceptions in the act allow financial institutions the ability to disclose financial information under certain conditions. If a financial product provided by a financial institution is owned by two or more parties, the institution is only required to notify one party. Financial institutions are also allowed to disclose information without ever notifying the customer if the information in question is used for an investigation regarding public safety.  Safeguards Rule  The Safeguards Rule was implemented into GLBA by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to set standards that financial institutions must follow when protecting financial information. The rule required that financial institutions create and implement a security program that is appropriate to the size of the institutions' operations. The program must keep information safe from any unauthorized access of information, unauthorized use of information, and threats to the safety of the information. Information systems that processes, stores, transmits, and destroys information must be used in the security program. The rule also states that institutions must dedicate employees to the development, implementation, and maintenance of the security program. There must be people trained to identity and respond to any security threats or data breaches.  Criticisms  The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act has been the subject of much criticism as experts claim that the act provides weak protection due to its broad language. Without clear explanation and better defined language, the act is open to interpretation which will ultimately work against consumers. The privacy policies required by the act are also unhelpful, as many of the policies written by financial institutions are intentionally complex to prevent customer comprehension. There is also a lack of rules that punish financial institutions for any noncompliance. Criticism has also been targeted at the opt-out rule in the act. Former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Jeffrey M. Lacker argues that the opt-out option, provided by banks in their policies to customers, is ineffective due to a weak marketplace for financial information. Sharing financial information is not profitable enough to motivate financial institutions to pay for customer consent, so opt-out notifications are rarely distributed. In situations where customers are notified, only an estimated 5% respond. The low response rate is evidence that consumers do not seem to care about their financial privacy. With unconcerned customers and a weak market, the opt-out option is rendered ineffective. = Fair Credit Reporting Act = The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) was passed in 1970 to regulate credit agencies and promote fair and secure handling of consumer information. The FCRA attempts to limit the dissemination of information through five main rules: # Credit reports and investigative reports must be differentiated so that any irrelevant is not mixed # Reports can only be made available to those with \\"legitimate business needs\\" # The subject of a report must be notified of any request for their information # Agencies must give consumers access to their own files if they ever should request it # A time limit is set for the retention of information on reports. Information that is seven years or older must be deleted while information regarding bankruptcies can be removed only after fourteen years According to the FCRA, obsolete information may not be investigated and included on reports. Information found in reports can be contested in the event that a mistake is found. The credit agency must begin an investigation, and if a mistake is proven to exist, the information must be removed immediately. If a consumer if affected by the contents of their report, the user of the report must notify the consumer so that he or she can access their file and receive an explanation of the contents of their file from the agency. The FCRA also includes the Red Flag Rule, which was added by the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act. A Change of Address Rule is also set in place so that government financial agencies must verify change of addresses. The FRCA includes multiple measures to promote compliance. The act states that unauthorized access to a file or receiving a report under false pretext will result in a criminal offense. Reporting agencies and those using the reports are held liable for any noncompliance as well. The consumer is also entitled to reparations as a result of any damages from any misuse of their information.  Criticisms  The Fair Credit Reporting Act faced criticism over the strength of its regulations as the act only limits the distribution of information instead of the collection of it. The act is also written with broad language which invites open interpretation that may lead to loopholes. Some criticism has also been directly aimed at the vagueness in defining \\"accuracy.\\" In the context of the act, \\"accuracy\\" can be interpreted as a credit report that is either correct or incomplete. = Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act = The Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act (FACTA) was passed by Congress in 2003 to amend the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). The amendments ensured that any state laws with stricter regulations than those outlined in the FCRA would be enforced first. State laws regarding credit scores, credit reports, and insurance that were to remain in effect as a result of the amendments were outlined within the act. Under the act, consumers received more rights to explanations of their credit scores and the right to a free credit report each year.  The Disposal Rule  The Disposal Rule set requirements under FACTA for how public and nonpublic entities have to destroy consumer reports in order to prevent unauthorized access to nonpublic consumer information. Under the act, disposal of physical information can be done through the burning, pulverization, and shredding of documents. Digital information can be disposed of by simply erasing electronic files. Information can also be destroyed by hiring contractors. Due diligence must be performed on documents to identify consumer information before they can be submitted to contractors for disposal. Any disposal of information must be done so in way that the documents cannot be reconstructed and read.  The Red Flags Rule  The Red Flags Rule was a rule set under FACTA that requires financial institutions and creditors to develop and implement programs to identify and prevent any identity theft threats. = Credit and Debit Card Receipt Clarification Act = The Credit and Debit Card Receipt Clarification act was passed in 2007 as an amendment to the FCRA. The act required that account numbers printed on receipts have to be shortened to five digits in order to protect consumer privacy. = Bank Secrecy Act = The Bank Secrecy Act was enacted in 1970 to deter people from hiding income in foreign financial institutions and to prevent financial institutions' common practice of photocopying items used in criminal investigations. The act gave the United States Treasury clearance to consolidate bank records so that the information can effectively serve in legal proceedings. It also set a requirement for financial institutions to maintain consumer records, especially those with international transactions. Financial institutions are required to hold records for six years and are obligated to report any suspicious transactions. = Fair Debt Collection Practices Act = The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) was passed in 1978 to give consumers rights and the ability to maintain accurate information when dealing with debt collection. Under the act, any consumer information regarding debt is protected. Requirements were set to outline the ways in which debt collectors are allowed to interact with a consumer when pursuing payment. Under the FDCPA, collectors are not allowed to publish a consumer's name and address on a bad debt list or reveal any information regarding the debt to unaffiliated third parties except the consumers' partner or attorney. If the collector is attempting to inquire about the whereabouts of the consumer, then they can disclose debt information to only neighbors and coworkers. Collectors are also not allowed disclose fraudulent information to credit reporting agencies in an attempt to collect the debt. = Electronic Funds Transfer Act = The Electronic Funds Transfer Act was passed by congress in 1978 to regulate the then growing use of electronic transfer of funds. The act implemented requirements so that banks have to notify their customers of any policies regarding electronic transfer of funds. A model statement is even included in the act in order to regulate the language in which policies would be presented to consumers. Banks are also held liable in the event that information is disclosed through telephone without consent. Also, banks would be held responsible for any damages that came as a result of unauthorized access to a consumer's information. = Dodd- Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act = The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was enacted in 2010 to bring about reforms to the financial system after the 2008 financial crisis and to establish the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.  State laws = California = California Consumer Privacy Act  The California Consumer Privacy Act was passed in 2018 to protect any and all California residents' nonpublic information. The act set requirements that regulates and attempts to limit the sale of personal information. However, companies can justify their sale of information through contracts with business partners. Those contracts would be taken into consideration when a company is reviewed for compliance to the act. If a company is unable to comply with provisions regarding the sale of information without disrupting their business, then they must receive consent through the opt-in option from minors under 16 years old or parental consent if the minor is under 13 years old. Companies must also give all other consumers the ability to opt-out of any disclosure of information through a webpage link that clearly and specifically says \\"Do Not Sell My Personal Information.\\" In the event that a consumer does opt out, the company cannot approach the consumer with the option to opt in again until a year has passed since the consumer opted out. Under the act, companies must notify consumers of their new rights regarding data access, disposal, and portability. The company must also provide a way for consumers to exercise their new rights and a way to verify any consumer requests to exercise their rights. Privacy policies must also be updated to reflect newly required information disclosures. Companies can deny a consumer's request to erase personal information under 9 conditions: # The information is needed to complete a transaction # The information is needed to identify and protect from fraudulent activity as well as prosecute those responsible for such attacks # The information is needed to identify and fix problems with functionality # The information is needed to exercise free speech # The information is needed to stay compliant with the California Communications Privacy Act # The information is needed to conduct statistical research of public interest # The information is needed to meet obligations with the consumer in question # The information is needed to meet legal obligations # The information is needed to meet the requirements in which the consumer initially provided the information The act also regulates any employer- employee relationships regarding personal information. Under the act, employers must provide a way for their employees to exercise their rights outlined in the act. Employees also have the ability to opt out of any sale of information. A clear link that specifically says \\"Do Not Sell My Personal Information\\" must also be provided to employees under the employers' website to help facilitate any opt-out requests. Under the act, employees can request the disclosure of certain categories of information. If employers plan to collect information concerning their employees, then they must notify their employees of what information was collected, why it was collected, and under what conditions would the information be used. If the employers were to gather additional data, then another notification must be sent out to employees with the same aforementioned details. Employees have the ability to request that the employers erase their information. However, employers also have the right to deny the request if maintaining the information is necessary to meet certain obligations. Employees must also be notified if their employers are selling their information under the California Civic Code's definition of \\"business purposes.\\" Companies that conduct business with California consumers must comply with the act if the company satisfies one of the three conditions stated under the act: # If the company has annual gross revenues of $25 million or more # If the company holds personal information of 50,000 or more California residents, households, and devices # If the company generates greater than or equal to 50% of their revenue by selling California residents' information Companies that are not physically located within California and conduct all of their business outside of the state may be exempt from the act. However, if such companies enter California or begin engaging in transactions with California residents online, then they would be expected to comply with the act.  California Privacy Act  The California Privacy Act is a state level privacy act that provides protection of consumer information. The act is described as a stricter version of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. The California Privacy Act provides narrower definitions of some language found in the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. For example, financial institutions that are regulated under the act only include institutions that are \\"significantly engaged in financial activities.\\" The act also provides an opt-in rule instead of opt-out which allows consumers more control over the situations in which financial institutions can handle information without consent. Financial information is also required to stay within one financial entity which means other institutions are not allowed access based on affiliation. Punishment is also outlined in the act to deal with any institution that fails to comply. Violations to the act may result in a maximum penalty of $500,000. However, the fine can double in situations concerning identity theft. Despite providing more stringent rules, the act also includes exceptions. Those who entered into contracts before the act was passed may still have their information shared if they do not manually opt out. Institutions that share the same regulator are allowed to exchange consumer information without notifying the customer. Customers also do not need to be notified that their information has been given out if the information is used for any legal proceedings.  California Consumer Credit Reporting Agencies Act  The California Consumer Credit Reporting Agencies Act (CCCRA) was passed in 1975 as the state's version of the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act. The act regulates consumer credit reporting agencies as well as any users of credit reports. The act also provides a narrower definition of \\"consumer credit report\\" as any information that falls within credit reports is protected by the act. The CCCRA allows consumers to request a copy of their credit file with a thorough explanation of any codes used, credit score with related information, records of any third party requests made for the consumer's files, and the identifiable information of any party third party that has received the consumer's file. Any information requested by the consumer must be made available by a person, by mail, or by phone with a trained person who is able provide a comprehensive explanation of the information. Credit reports can be disclosed to third parties without notifying the consumer if the information is related to the party requesting the information, if it is to complete a court order, or if the party requesting it has legitimate use for the information.  Right to Financial Privacy Act  California passed their own Right to Financial Privacy Act two years before the federal government passed an act of the same name in 1976. The act regulated the state's government agencies' abilities to access nonpublic consumer information. As a result of the act, California's government agencies are not authorized to access financial records unless the consumer gives consent or if a subpoena or a search warrant is issued for the information. As long as government agencies show proof of customer consent, a subpoena, or a search warrant, financial institutions are obligated to disclose the requested financial information. With proof, financial institutions do not have to verify that all laws were followed before handing over information.  Song-Beverly Credit Card Act  The Song-Beverly Credit Card Act was passed in 1971 to protect consumer information in credit card transactions. Under the act, companies may not collect personally identifiable information from consumers who purchase goods or services using credit cards. Companies cannot set conditions in which consumers must consent to sharing their information in order to use their credit cards for a transaction. However, consumer information can be requested in order to complete a credit card transactions as long as the information is never recorded. The act also set a redundant state level requirement that companies must shorten a consumer's credit and debit card information on receipts. There are exceptions to the act as companies are still able to collect information from consumer who pay using debit card of cash. Under the act, companies can still collect consumer data if a credit card is being used to collect money in situations similar to damages and defaults. In the event of a consumer return or refund, companies are allowed to collect information to protect against fraud. Gas stations are also allowed to only collect a consumer's zip code information to protect themselves from fraud. = Vermont = Regulation B-2018-01: Privacy of Consumer Financial and Health Information  Regulation B-2018-01: Privacy of Consumer Financial and Health Information was passed in Vermont to protect privacy of financial information. Financial privacy is defined by the first four articles in the regulation. Article I The first article in the regulation is used define what the regulation is in general. As stated in the article, the purpose of the regulation is regulate the handling of any private information connected to financial institutions. The regulation defines financial institutions through nine conditions: # Financial institutions defined by the Vermont statues # Licensed or registered individuals engaging in financial activities defined by the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 # Mortgage brokers, mortgage loan originators, lenders, and sales finance companies # Independent trust companies # Money service providers # Debt adjusters # Loan service providers # Foreign financial institutions # Subsidiaries of any of the above Article II * Financial institutions are required to inform customers of their privacy policy with an understandable notification. * Customers must be notified every 12 months of the financial institution's privacy policy. * Privacy notifications must include the nine points of information outlined by the regulation: *# What information the financial institution collects *# What information the financial institution chooses to share *# Categories which affiliated and nonaffiliated parties the financial institutions disclose information to fall into *# The categories of information regarding former customers that the financial institution has shared, and to which parties the information has been shared with *# Whether a financial institution has shared information with a nonaffiliated third party under an exception *# A outline of the methods in which a customer can exercise their right to opt-in *# If any private financial information has been shared under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, federal implementing regulations, and the Vermont Fair Credit Reporting Act *# The financial institution's policies regarding protecting consumer financial information *# If any information has been shared using exceptions authorized under the regulation * If a financial institution chooses to revise its privacy policy, it must still abide by the initial notice it sent to customers until customers are notified of the changes or if the customers gives consent since the changes * Notifications must be delivered to customers in writing unless the customer has given consent to receiving the notifications electronically Article III * Consumers have the ability to partially opt-in, which means that they can pick and choose what information they give consent to the financial institution to share * If a financial institution receives information form another, unaffiliated party, the institution is allowed to re-disclose the information if it is to parties affiliated to the unaffiliated party they received the information from, if it is to their own affiliated parties, of if they receive permission from the consumer * Unless the financial institution is disclosing information to a consumer reporting agency, the institution is not allowed to share account information to parties that would use the information for marketing purposes Article IV * Financial institutions can share their customers' financial information with unaffiliated third parties if the third parties are using the information to carry out services for the institution or if the third parities are acting on behalf of the institution * Financial institutions can disclose a customer information if it is in the interest of enforcing a transaction that the customer authorized or is in connection to  Regulatory Agencies = Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) = The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is an independent regulatory agency within the United State Federal Reserve. The CFPB promotes fair practice by regulating consumer interactions with financial institutions. It has complete authority over institutions that do not hold consumer deposits. For institutions that hold consumer deposits with $10 million or less in assets, the CFPB only has rule making authority, as authority over enforcement remains with other financial regulators. As part of its enforcement powers, the CFPB can initiate investigations, issue subpoenas, hold hearings, and hand out fines of over a million dollars for violations. The bureau also has the ability to enforce and make rules regarding any existing federal financial privacy laws. = Federal Trade Commission (FTC) = The Federal Trade Commission is an independent regulatory agency responsible for protecting consumers and competition. In 1995, the FTC became involved with privacy regulation. At the beginning, the agency promoted self regulation as they encouraged companies to produce their own privacy policies that the FTC would help enforce. The FTC believed that simply backing companies' policies would help legitimize the policies and give the policies credibility and importance in the eyes of consumers. However, as privacy became an increasingly prevalent problem, the FTC evolved into the de facto authority over consumer privacy. Although it was never explicitly stated that the FTC would have power over consumer privacy regulations, Congress allowed the FTC more and more responsibilities beginning in the late 1990s. Settlements that the agency made would also become considered as de facto common law. Eventually the FTC, in general, gained the power to create privacy regulations and implement protections against fraudulent activities. The FTC deals with noncompliance through civil litigation, criminal litigation, and administrative enforcement actions. Enforcement actions begin with complaints or claims against a company. The FTC has power to conduct investigations and can issue subpoenas as well as compel companies to provide reports under oath. The agency also has the power to issue fines for violations. The FTC only uses its full enforcement powers if any violations they discover are considered major. For most minor violations, the FTC will likely help companies identity and fix any problems contributing to noncompliance.

Early life and education  While attending St. Cloud State University, Tschida interned with glass sculptor Dale Chihuly, who taught him how to work with neon. Tschida earned his M.F.A. from the University of Minnesota in 1977 and built the university's first neon studio.  Career and work  Tschida's work focuses on kinetic neon sculpture. In \\"Light in Motion\\" (1980), Tschida aimed to travel \\"the speed of light\\" by mounting a 22-foot neon mast to the top of a Chevy Impala and driving on the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah, taking a time-lapse photo of the endeavor. A photo of \\"Light in Motion\\" was featured on the cover of Glass: The UrbanGlass Art Quarterly in 1996 for an issue in which his work is profiled by glass art critic and curator William Warmus. In 1985, Chihuly invited Tschida to teach glass art at Pilchuck Glass School and to establish the school's neon shop alongside Deborah Dohne. In 1991, his installation \\"Martini Glass\\" was featured in the American Craft Museum exhibition \\"Vessels: From Use to Symbol.\\" Curator William Warmus described the intent of the \\"Martini Glass\\": \\"It attracts attention to the exhibition in the same way that signs on neighborhood bars are designed to lure us inside.\\" In 2006, Corning Museum of Glass curator Tina Oldknow described Tschida as \\"a mainstay of the influential glass program at Alfred University.

This may often specifically pertain to personal information which includes addresses and family members among other data that can be used to identify the individual. Different from the privacy of the general public, 'Celebrity Privacy' is considered as \\"controlled publicity\\". It is usually challenged by the press and the fans. Paparazzi have been known to 'stalk' and 'chase' celebrities and make commercial use of their private data whereas fans have been known to break into celebrities' houses to 'stalk', 'kidnap', or even 'assassinate' them. To protect celebrity privacy, some national and state governments set up privacy laws particularly for protecting celebrities as well as their children. The legal impact of these celebrity privacy laws has currently been undetermined, since the curb for celebrity privacy intrusion often counteracts the legal principle of ‚Äúfree press‚Äù in many countries.  Debate  Scholars have debated how much or what type of privacy celebrities and their friends or family can or should expect. Commonly posed arguments center upon topics such as the idea of celebrity privacy as controlled publicity, the intrusion of paparazzi or fans, and what types of privacy should be granted to and expected by children of celebrities. = Celebrity privacy as a controlled publicity = In order to keep high public exposure and show positive professional images, celebrities and their teams often intentionally manage or control how their private lives are presented to the public. According to attorney Jamie Nordhaus, \\"The boundaries of privacy and publicity for celebrities can become blurred, as they most are always watched by fans, paparazzi, and other potential stalkers.\\" It has been suggested that celebrities \\"remain conscious of maintaining a public persona when they are in the public eye as opposed to a personal one in private\\" and \\"negotiate with the press to release staged private life photos\\". Jens Hoffman has argued that, 'Celebrity attempts to sacrifice their privacy for publicity may result in a loss of legal protections, as celebrities claiming that an invasion of privacy by the press could be seen as utilizing media in order to achieve or maintain fame'. The latter argument was used in a court decision on a stolen sex tape that featured American actress Pamela Anderson Lee and her then-boyfriend Bret Michaels. Lee had sued Internet Entertainment Group (IEG) and Paramount for broadcasting a story in 1998, that contained excerpts from the tape, however the court considered her as voluntarily sacrificing her privacy in order to publicize herself. Scholar Seong Hong has stated that based on the court decision, Lee‚Äôs privacy right was not protected because of her celebrity identity. = Intrusion by paparazzi and fans = Paparazzi  Princess Diana The term ‚Äúpaparazzi‚Äù‚Äô is used to define the freelance photographers who take celebrities‚Äô exclusive pictures and sell them to the press for financial purposes. Techniques used by the paparazzi include stalking celebrities and their children, taking photos of them with or without consent, and chasing celebrities‚Äô cars. Some see these techniques as causing turbulence to the lives of the celebrities and those with them and that some aggressive techniques may result in the injury or death of the celebrity. The death of Diana, Princess of Wales, has been cited as an example of the risks of paparazzi techniques. Besides, scholar Elizabeth Hindman claims that the sale of exaggerated content without context to sensationalize particular moments has decreased credibility in the news industry. According to Ray Murray's research, some paparazzi will ‚Äúdraw an ethical line‚Äù by abiding by specific rules and in a series of paparazzi interviews, most of the participants claimed that they would not break the law, and some attested that they would not take any photo of celebrity children without consent. Scholar Andrew Mendelson argues that paparazzi are valuable in that they reveal potential mismatches between the public image and the reality of celebrities who possess great power in contemporary society, which legitimizes the paparazzi's invasion of celebrity privacy as a form of watchdog journalism. Besides, Anne Jerslev and Mette Mendelson have noted that the paparazzi have become integrated into the mainstream culture and their photographs are distributed widely and quickly by consumers.  Fans  The ‚Äúdual entertainment path model‚Äù suggested by scholar Kineta Hung shows that fans and non-fans adopt different ways to engage with their favorite celebrities For non-fans, they usually pay attention to celebrities and the released news to escape from boredom. In contrast, Hung theorizes that fans put a much higher emotional investment in order to create an individual ‚Äúbond‚Äù with celebrities, which gives them pleasure and a sense of satisfaction. According to Hung, fans may typically try to become physically and mentally closer to their idols by attending concerts, movies, and fan-meetings. In extreme circumstances, fans may become obsessed with celebrities and invade their privacy by stalking them. Scholar Jens Hoffman has argued that this is a result of a pathological fixation, as fans exhibiting this can believe that there is a special connection between their favorite celebrities and themselves, even though such a relationship does not exist in reality. Once unsatisfied, this fixation can lead fans to invade celebrity privacy out of disappointment and resentment. In South Korean culture, a fan who is overly interested in the private lives of K-POP idols or other public figure is called a \\"Sasaeng fan\\", which means \\"private life fan\\" in English. According to a study by William Patrick and Samantha Xiang, Sasaeng fans are typically teenage girls between 13‚Äì22 years old, and their common stalking behaviors include installing hidden cameras in idols‚Äô home, chasing idols‚Äô car at high speed, and stealing personal things from idols‚Äô room. Sasaeng fans are viewed negatively in South Korea due to actions such as poisoning members of a disliked K-POP idol or using bodily fluids to write letters to the object of their affections. = Celebrity children = The public interest in the private lives of celebrities has prompted paparazzi to catch specific and trivial details of celebrities‚Äô daily lives, which includes the lives of their children. Paparazzi photographs of these children are frequently posted in magazines, sometimes with friends or family, and often portray the celebrity and children's fame and lifestyles as high-quality and luxurious. These images can be either authorized or unauthorized. Seong Hong claims that due to the circulation of celebrity children photos, the media leads the public to establish a pseudo-relationship with celebrity children and imagine them as ‚Äúour children‚Äù. This public imagination combined with the potentially constant presence of paparazzi has been seen as having the potential to threaten the privacy of celebrity children.  Positive and negative effects  According to Lidia Maropo and Ana Jorge, celebrity children usually appear on newspapers and magazines together with their families: moments like celebrity children playing the park, having a picnic with the whole families or just hanging out with their parents are posted on media, which reflects the importance of children in the family and advocates for a more harmonious family relationship. At the same time, the celebrity children photos also suggest a pleasant experience and a sense of satisfaction of being a parent. The circulation of celebrity children images attracts the public to focus on the family relationship and makes them realize the happiness brought by children and the responsibility of parents. The exposure of celebrity children to the public can result in the invasion of their privacy rights. For example, the 20-month-old son of aviator Charles A. Lindbergh, who became a national celebrity after he created records for flying from the U.S to France in 1927, was kidnapped and murdered in 1932. After this tragedy, Jon, Lindbergh‚Äôs second son, was chased continuously by paparazzi‚Äôs cars. To protect Jon, Lindbergh finally decided not to raise legal appealing but to move outside of the U.S with his family. Additionally, some celebrities will send photos of their children to media in order to prevent paparazzi from continuing disrupting their private lives: American film celebrities David Arquette and Courteney Cox released the photo of their daughter Coco to the press, which prevented them from being chased by paparazzi.  Legal protection regarding children privacy = The United Nations = The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) was permitted in 1989 as human rights started to gain more attention globally. This treaty deals with the most fundamental issue between children and the media, such as free expression, non-discrimination and respect. Article 16, in particular, set that children have the right to protect themselves when encountering illegal interference of privacy or attacks on reputation. All the UN countries, except U.S and Somalia, approved and sighed this treaty. = United States = Seong Hong argues that in the United States, the celebrity children privacy has been rarely protected by U.S law currently. The main reason is that the legal protection of celebrity children is too narrow and it might counteract with the First Amendment, which emphasizes ‚Äúfree press‚Äù to encourage democratic voices. However, as the California Anti-Paparazzi Act was introduced, some celebrities suggested the state government to put more focus on celebrity children: actress Halle Berry hoped that the law could restrict paparazzi from approaching celebrity children since her children were afraid of going to school and trips due to the stalking of paparazzi. Besides, scholar Joshua Azriel suggests that there should be a full ban on the photos of celebrity children with stronger punishment. = Brazil = In Brazil, the Child and Adolescent Statute (ECA in Portuguese acronym) both directly and indirectly addressed the relationship between children and media. ECA grants the fundamental civil and human rights to children, including free expression and the right of image, idea and identity, etc. Article 18, in particular, emphasizes that everyone has the responsibility to protect the dignity of children and to save them from any violent or terrifying situation. Besides, Article 74-80 provides children with legal protection to harmful public media, such as violent television show. = Portugal = In Portugal, the Law for Protection of Children and Youth at Risk (LPCJP in Portuguese acronym) protects children from media that brings risky elements, such as violence or inhumanity. Besides, The Young Offenders‚Äô Law prohibits media from identifying youngsters from 12-16 who commit illegal actions.  Global celebrity privacy laws = United States = California ‚ÄúAnti-Paparazzi‚Äù Law  In August 1997, Princess Diana died from a car accident in France which was suspected to be caused by seven paparazzi. Although the judge clarified later that the drunk driver rather than paparazzi caused the accident, California government was aware of the danger brought by paparazzi and thus quickly set the first anti-paparazzi law. In 1998, California set the ‚Äúinvasion of privacy statute‚Äù, which prohibited the use of digital devices to take photos of celebrities on private occasions. However, this statute is criticized by opponents who believe it might inhibit the freedom of the press to gather news. Also, the language used was considered too broad and vague. Some media attorneys described the statute as a ‚ÄúPandora‚Äôs box‚Äù that brought a large number of severe problems. The First Amendment of the ‚Äúinvasion of privacy statute‚Äù was passed in 2005, which regulated that the profits from photos taken during altercations between celebrities and photographers will be forfeited. The fine was imposed in 2005 by California legislature on making profit from any picture in which paparazzi assaulting celebrity and expanding 1708.8 civil code. In 2009, another new law A.B 524 stated that up to $50,000 penalties would be charged from the first publishers of the photos taken in the ways that violate the privacy statute. This law aimed to stop the paparazzi who take private photos of celebrities for profit-gaining reasons. However, scholar Christina Locke and Kara Murrhee claims that the law is not effective because the first publishers of celebrity photos can usually make over a million dollars. Furthermore, A.B 524 seemly contradicts the Supreme Court again for prohibiting the press to gain news legally. Since California noticed that confrontations between celebrities and paparazzi still happened and were even exacerbated, in January 2010, another anti-paparazzi law A.B 2479 was passed to address two main problems: paparazzi‚Äôs car-chasing which often leads to accidents and their behaviors that prevent the celebrities from moving freely. A.B 2479 further established both financial and criminal penalties for people who result in reckless driving because of the intention to gain photos or recording of other people for commercial purpose‚Äîthe fine will be between $145 to $1,000, and the term of imprisonment will be between 5‚Äì90 days. If any child is inside the car during the reckless driving, the fine will be up to $5,000 and the term of imprisonment will be up to one year. Also, to curb the paparazzi from encompassing the celebrities and thus prevent them from moving freely, the law counts this behavior as false imprisonment that allows for extra damages. In 2015, the state appeals the superior court of Los Angeles to arrest the paparazzi for breaking California vehicle code section 40008 in which paparazzi endangered the motorist and chased the celebrity in high speed car to take picture. = Debate = The supporters of A.B 2479 were The City of Los Angeles, Screen Actors Guild and Paparazzi Reform Initiative. They argued that the series of aggressive behaviors of paparazzi, such as parking their cars to block the celebrities‚Äô cars or crowding the celebrities in public spaces like airports and entrances to public facilities have seriously disrupted celebrities‚Äô private lives. On the contrary, California Newspaper Publishers Association (CNPA) opposed the bill since it undermines the activity of the press to gather news freely. Also, CNPA argued that the penalties for reckless driving targeted to journalists are unfair. According to Christina Locke and Kara Murrhee, even though compared to previous bills, A.B 2479 has made significant changes regarding focuses, the conflict between the California anti-paparazzi law and the First Amendment of Constitution still exists.  \\"Anti-Paparazzi law\\" vs. The First Amendment  Keith Willis claims that in the U.S legal system, the conflict between the right to privacy and the right to free expression exists. Many state bills, such as California‚Äôs anti-paparazzi law, are set to protect celebrity privacy, while the First Amendment of Constitution ensures the press‚Äôs freedom to express and gather information. In history, the balance of these two forces has been uncertain‚Äîsometimes the celebrities‚Äô privacy requests outweigh the freedoms of press and expression, while other times the First Amendment is prioritized over celebrities who claim to be disrupted by the open press. = United Kingdom = To prevent the royal family from being disrupted by the media, Britain set laws to restrict press reporting earlier than many other countries. Also, institutions like the European Convention on Human Rights and the British Law Commission have been submitting proposals to protect individual privacy. After the death of Princess Diana in 1997, the Press Complaints Commission, a self-regulating organization of British media, proposed a series of regulations to prevent similar accidents from happening. The proposals include banning paparazzi photos taken through the continuous pursuit, expanding the definition of private property, strengthening the protection for celebrity children, and prevention of media collective harassment. = France = According to Jamie Nordhaus, although the French government set strong laws to prevent paparazzi from invading celebrity privacy, these laws counteract with each other and thus are not efficient enough to protect celebrities and their children. The government prohibits paparazzi from publishing any photo that is not consented by the subjects but allows them to publish photos taken at public places. Besides, the high profits resulted from publishing exclusive celebrity photos in France greatly exceed the $32,000 fine, which encourages French paparazzi to take risks. = New Zealand = Similar to the U.S, Seong Hung argues that celebrities and their children in New Zealand are rarely protected by privacy laws for now. In 2004, Mr Hosking, a well-known television celebrity in New Zealand, sued the Pacific Magazine for taking and publishing the photos of his children, but the Court of Appeal ruled against Mr. Hosking by stating that the photographs did not invade the privacy right because they were taken in public spaces. = Spain = The threat to private life due to expansion in technology and photography was noted in 1890 by Warren and Brandies, lawyers from Boston. After more than one century, the ways of finding information about someone private life have increased which easily violate the right to privacy. The government have imposed legal regulation considering the right to privacy for revealing someones personal information to others, spreading through social media, allowing others to have access of someone personal details and allow others to spread and expose the information. In the Article 198 of Spanish panel code, the civil government have analyzed the new code to the right to privacy punishable offence which are taking someones personal paper, letters, electronic messages, belongings or intercepting communication in someones personal space and exposing or spreading obtained information. The punishment of this offences will be greater if the person doing is an authority and civil servant.  Other laws regarding celebrity privacy = Right of publicity = United States  The right of publicity, also called personality rights, aims to control and protect the unauthorized commercial use of people‚Äôs identity, such as name, photos, or likeness. Based on the right of privacy, the right of publicity is relatively new in the U.S‚Äîit was first recognized in the 1953 Haelan Laboratories v. Topps Chewing Gum case, and was later analyzed by Supreme Court in the 1977 Zacchini v. Scripps-Howard Broadcasting Co.case. The right of publicity is significant because with the advent of a new media age when ‚Äúeveryone can be famous on the Internet for 15 minutes‚Äù, the right of publicity becomes increasingly relevant and vital protection. This right is closely related to celebrity privacy because most of the time, it is used to protect celebrities from paparazzi or individuals who take the celebrities‚Äô names and images for commercial use. Currently no federal law in the U.S protects celebrities‚Äô right of publicity, however states like California have established statutes and common law to protect their celebrity citizens. Keith Willis argues that the publicity right controversies often happen on celebrity product endorsement issues.  Canada  According to Ellen Whitehorn, Canada government protects the right of publicity, but the extent of the scope is still uncertain. The Courts protect individuals‚Äô gaining from self-marketing, including name, images and personality, when it is violated. Similar to the U.S, the right of publicity laws mostly concentrate on different provinces: for example, Ontario has specific common laws which prevent the personality rights from being violated commercially. However, while the right of publicity in the U.S originates from the right to privacy, the personality right in Canada stems from unfair competition law.  United Kingdom  Ellen Whitehorn claims that The United Kingdom currently does not have a specific legal statute to protect the right of publicity because, in history, U.K has been inclined to offer more protection for free speech and thus less focus on celebrity and their publicity rights. However, the U.K government still protects the right of publicity through other torts, such as some claims in the British Human Rights Act, violation of copyright, or misuse of private information. = Copyright = Copyright is also closely related to celebrity privacy. In the U.S, the Congress enacts copyright law based on Article 1(8)8 of the Constitution, which suggest that authors have the exclusive right to their work in a limited period. The original work protected by copyright laws includes literacy work, artistic work, musical work, and dramatic work etc. Since the producers of the original work are artists, musicians, or authors who are usually well-known, they are likely to be involved in copyright lawsuits, which could affect their rights of privacy. Besides, scholar O'Neill Eaton suggests that sometimes the press fights for the copyright of paparazzi photos to make most of the profits from exclusive celebrity images. In 2006, the famous U.S celebrity gossip blogger Perez Hilton was sued by paparazzi agency X17 because he posted photos taken by X17 onto his own website without permission. Perez has denied violated copyright laws, stating that his work falls under fair use, as he uses the material for humor and satire.

It was designed by Peddle Thorp & Walker Architects and built in 1931 by John Grant and Sons, Master Builders. It was also known as Sports House from 1978‚Äì1991. The property is owned by Property NSW, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002.  History  Science House was opened on 7 May 1931 by the NSW Governor Air Vice-Marshal Sir Philip Game as a co- operative venture between three of the major scientific organisations in NSW. A venue to share facilities and operate from a centralised headquarters had been discussed since the 1870s and, in 1905, a committee was formed to that end but World War I and lack of finances forestalled the plan until the 1920s. After the Royal Victorian Institute of Architects and the Institution of Engineers built their Allied Societies Trust Building in Melbourne, The Royal Society of NSW, the Institution of Engineers, Australia, and the Linnaean Society of NSW decided to follow suit and formed a joint committee in 1926 to pursue the matter. When the site at the corner of Essex and Gloucester Streets was granted by the NSW Government in July 1927, an architectural competition was held by the Royal Australian Institute of Architects in 1928 with a first prize of . It was won by Peddle Thorp and Walker who designed an Inter-war Commercial Palazzo style building, one of the few in Sydney. The adjudicator's report on the entry said the design was: In June 1930 Governor Game laid the Foundation Stone and the building was completed in January 1931. It was constructed by John Grant & Sons who kept to the budget of but allowed enough structural integrity in the building for additional storeys to be added in the future, and an additional lift to be installed. The first general meeting of the Royal Society of NSW was held in Science House on 6 May 1931. When the building was opened the three scientific bodies were joined by The Australian Chemical Institute, The Australian and New Zealand Association for the Advancement of Science, The Australian National Research Council, The Institute of Architects NSW, The Institution of Surveyors NSW and the Standards Association of Australia. The Council of the Institute of Architects of NSW decided that the Sir John Sulman Medal (for 1932) should be for an institutional building and seven buildings were nominated. On 3 January 1933 it was announced that Peddle Thorp and Walker had been awarded the inaugural Sulman Medal for the design of Science House. During World War II an air raid shelter was constructed in a small hall on the ground floor. There were plans to extend the building an additional three storeys in 1953 but that did not eventuate. The building was occupied by the various scientific organisations from 1931 until 1976 and in 1978 the NSW Department of Sport and Recreation moved into the building which became known as \\"Sports House\\" until they left in 1991. During this time the large auditorium continued to be used for talks, and the building housed 11,000 books and journals and 1,000 films covering many areas of Sport. A Hall of Champions was installed in 1982, which included a Sports Museum to commemorate outstanding sportsmen and women of NSW. Major works were carried out on the building during 1995-96, after which the Australian Centre for Languages occupied the building, remaining there until 2007. In 2012, New York University established a global campus in Sydney, leasing the ground floor and the three floors directly above. The campus has a number of classrooms, a computer lab, library, and administrative offices, with a Student Activities Center doubling as a study lounge and space for social gatherings. The campus hosts courses in Fall, Spring and J Term and has 25 instructors, 8 administrative staff and around 150 students who reside in a separate residence hall. Courses cover a range of disciplines including business, psychology, journalism, media, culture and communication, literature, creative writing, environmental studies, history, anthropology, public health, organic chemistry, physics and biology. Students are taught by academics and professionals affiliated with leading institutions in Sydney. In 2016 it was announced that the NSW Government would sell more than $100 million worth of commercial property in The Rocks in order to preserve and enhance the historic area and Science House was included.Cranston, AFR, 2016. In August 2019, a 99-year leasehold was offered and a sale was announced in January 2020.  Description  Gloucester Street frontage of Science House, pictured in 2009. This listing includes the significant original interiors. Science House sits on the south-western corner of the intersection of Gloucester and Essex Streets at Church Hill, Sydney. Science House is a six- storey building. The structure of the building consists of a concrete-encased steel frame of columns and reinforced concrete slabs. The external masonry walls of the building are non-load bearing and merely support their own weight. The design of the principal facades in Gloucester and Essex Streets are divided into three architectural zones mirroring the exaggerated ground floor, piano nobile and attic storey of the Florentine Early Renaissance palazzo type. At Science House the exaggerated \\"ground storey\\" comprises the Ground Floor and Floor 1; the piano nobile Floors 2, 3 and 4 the attic storey, Floor 5. The exaggerated \\"ground storey\\" is built of fine quality ashlar sandstone masonry with rusticated joints. In Gloucester Street, the windows have semi-circular heads rising through two storeys. A decorative metal grille fills the semi-circular arches; below the windows have steel frames. The piano nobile at Science House is stretched through three floors and has the most simple architectural treatment. The walls are built of textured brick of subtle colour variations. The window apertures are regularly spaced in nine bays along Gloucester Street, four bays in Essex Street. Each window aperture consists of a pair of identical double hung timber sash-windows each sash of six panels in the general design and portion of the Georgian style windows. The attic storey is more highly decorated. At window sill level a projecting square profile string course runs along the Gloucester and Essex Street facades.Howard, R., et. al., 1991, pp. 15‚Äì21. Style: Commercial Italian Renaissance Palazzo; Storeys: Six; Facade: Stone and face-brickwork; Internal Walls: The walls are largely undecorated and finished with painted plaster over brickwork.; Floor Frame: Timber (original); Roof Frame: Terracotta pan tiles; Ceilings: Moulded plasterwork embellished ceiling (the main lecture hall); Fire Stairs: South-western corner of the building.; Lifts: Two (opposite the entrance doors), original lift (southern side).

The original interiors and exteriors were conserved or restored including the replacement of some of the original terracotta roof tiles, external stone and brickwork, the internal partitions, corridors, main reception rooms and auditorium. New light fittings similar to the original were manufactured and original fittings were repaired and upgraded. New corridor paving was installed and the main stair and corridors reinstated.  Heritage listing  Science House and site are of State heritage significance for their historical and scientific cultural values. The site and building are also of State heritage significance for their contribution to The Rocks area which is of State Heritage significance in its own right. The importance of Science House is derived primarily from its aesthetic, associational and social significance, established as a building of exemplary architectural design for its period, receiving the first Sulman Award of the Royal Australian Institute of Architects, New South Wales chapter in 1932. Despite changes of use and occupancy, the building retains physical evidence of its strong association with Australia's three leading organisations that built and first occupied it; the Linnean Society, the Royal Society of New South Wales and the Institute of Engineers Australia. The building was designed in 1928 by a notable and long-standing architectural firm, Peddle, Thorp and Walker. The building is an outstanding and rare example of the Commercial Palazzo style through its Georgian references. It illustrates the style externally within the three classic bands over five storeys; sandstone ashlar coursing at street level, face brick to the middle three levels; and an elaborate top level marked by a strong cornice to both street facades. It makes a distinguished contribution to the streetscapes of the south-western section of the historic Rocks precinct. The building's social significance is primarily derived from continued use since it was first constructed by the three cultural institutions as a centre of learning and inquiry, which has varied over time from science and technology to sports and education. The building is unique for the quality and intactness of its interiors. Science House was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Science House has been used since the building was constructed by a number of institutions as a centre of learning and scientific inquiry. The building stands as a symbol of the development of the city of Sydney, not only as the major commercial centre in Australia but also as a place to establish cultural institutions. The building reflects Australia's scientific, intellectual and cultural development of the time for the three institutions' amalgamation of activities, inhabiting a building especially designed for their necessities. This idea of a shared home befitting the needs of several organisations was a novel idea to Sydney. Science House still demonstrates the specific requirement for the design to provide a lecture hall with demonstration facilities, meeting rooms, offices and a library. The building can continue to interpret the existence of the scientific society within the physical fabric of the city. The intact significant architectural features displaying their reference to science include the Science House external sign over the entrance to the building, the crest with three lamps located internally over the entrance doors of the foyer, the lecture hall with its bio box, blackboard, demonstration desk containing sink and gas connection and other meeting rooms including Edgeworth David Room (reception) and the foyer fitted with book cases. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. Science House has a strong and special association with the Linnean Society, the Royal Society of New South Wales and the Institution of Engineers Australia as well as significant groups and persons. Firstly, with the three institutions of scientific learning and inquiry who believed strongly that a central place of learning was required. Secondly, with the architectural firm, Peddle Thorp and Walker which was responsible for the design of the building developed through a design competition and then saw it through to its completion. Peddle, Thorp and Walker grew to become one of the largest and prolific architectural practices in Australia continuing to this day. Thirdly, as the first building awarded the Royal Australian Institute of Architects New south Wales Chapter the Sulman Award named in honour of one of Australia's leading architects, Sir John Sulman. The award marks Science House as a worthy example of design excellence. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Science House is characteristic of the Inter- war period Commercial Palazzo style of architecture with highly refined detailing both externally and internally. It is widely recognised even today as an outstanding example of its type. At the time of its construction it was so well regarded that it was the recipient of the first Sulman Award. It exhibits the principal characteristics of the style with a firm sandstone base with large arched windows, a plainer brick central portion with repetitive well proportioned pattern of windows and strongly expressed top floor embellished with classical detail and elaborate cornice. The building is also an example of Neo-classical Revival architecture in Australia and is an untainted model of the Commercial Palazzo style in Sydney. The facades are comparable to Louis Sullivan's treatment of the tripartite facade which draws parallels with the base, shaft and capital of a column. The facades also reflect the five principles described by Richard Apperly for identifying the Commercial Palazzo style of architecture. These include: # A strong base at street level which may incorporate a mezzanine with elements portrayed in large scale, employing materials, colours and textures that may differ from the levels above. # The shaft is reflected by the typical office floors expressed externally by repetitive windows and the facade devoid of decoration or detail. # The \\"capital\\" of the building would be represented by the expression of the topmost level or levels with a projecting cornice which might also include an attic storey above. # The building should convey its masonry construction and should conceal any references to the structural frame. # The decorations and details should be derived from classical references such as from the Renaissance and Mannerist era such as the use of arches and rusticated surfaces. Important internal spaces such as the original cruciform foyer, original Lecture Hall, original Reception Room (Edgeworth David room) on the ground floor possess fine detailing and spatial qualities that are intact in their fit out and finishes. The two major intact street front facades at Gloucester and Essex Street contribute greatly to the streetscape character and add to The Rocks area's significant buildings. The building is sympathetic in its scale and material to its surroundings which are both old and new. It also takes advantage of the corner site with its two decorated facades, which can be viewed from the nearby streets. The pantile- clad hipped roof also can be seen from prominent views such as form the Sydney Harbour Bridge. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Science House has the considerable significance in its ability to demonstrate the development, practice and usage of learned society and professional bodies such as Royal Society of NSW, the Institution of Engineers, Australia and the Linnaean Society. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Science House has very limited to no archaeological research potential as the site associated with Science House is wholly occupied by the building and was subject to substantial physical disturbance when it was constructed. It has considerable value for its ability to set a benchmark for research into the attitudes and taste that determine architectural excellence in different periods. Science House fulfils an important role in comparative analysis for architectural historians and understanding of historical development in building technologies. Like many buildings along this frontage, the ground floor is cut into the slope while the main entrance on Gloucester Street is located on street level. Recent excavations at 171‚Äì193 Gloucester Street recovered a range of archaeological features and deposits despite the construction of commercial buildings in the early 20th century. This may also be applied to Science House. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Science House, although not a unique example of the Inter-war period Commercial Palazzo style, is an extremely refined version employing classical details with a Georgian flavour, which is uncommon and rivalled by one other example in Sydney's central business district, Beneficial House on George Street. The other representatives of the style relying generally on more Italianate qualities. Recognition of its value by the first award of the Sulman medal marks it out as very special and therefore rare. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Science House possesses all the primary characteristics of the Commercial Palazzo style, which was popular from the late Federation period into the later war period to reflect the image and status of corporate and institutional entities and is well represented in Central Sydney through its Georgian flavour, it is a significant variation to this class of items. It also demonstrates it type and period very well through its remarkably intact exterior and major internal spaces.

It is the only Tang Dynasty album to feature a five-piece lineup.  Background  Romantic Knight was released almost a full decade after Tang Dynasty's last album, Epic. The group underwent several lineup changes, beginning with the departure of guitarist Kaiser Kuo in May 1999. Kuo was briefly replaced by Iron Kite frontman Yu Yang, who was in turn replaced by Chen Lei in October 2000. At the beginning of 2002, Liu Yijun, lead guitarist on the band's 1992 debut album, rejoined the band. His return transformed Tang Dynasty into a quintet, with Liu and Chen on guitars and frontman Ding Wu on lead vocals and occasional third guitar.  Composition, themes, and recording  Influences from traditional Chinese music and literature are far more prevalent on Romantic Knight than on the group's previous albums. \\"To keep our own style, we try not merely to imitate or follow Western rock music\\", Ding told Culture Express in 2007. Liu added that \\"each member tries to cultivate himself in traditional Chinese culture by reading ancient poetry, playing the guqin, practicing calligraphy, and painting. Without these elements absorbed by the heart and soul, everything would be superficial\\". Each track on the album is a story relating the band members' experiences. The title track reflects upon and celebrates the achievements and struggles of the early pioneers of Chinese rock. \\"Joyful Sorrow\\" is inspired by Fran√ßoise Sagan's 1954 novel Bonjour Tristesse, with the concept of harmony between happiness and sorrow reinterpreted through Ding Wu's eyes. The album prominently features Chinese musical influences, and often utilizes Chinese instruments themselves. \\"Drunken Madness\\" is based on a guqin piece of the same name attributed to poet Ruan Ji. The song opens with piece's main motif played on guitar, and features the Twelve Girls Band, a Chinese folk ensemble. \\"Pathway\\" integrates Xinjiang-inspired folk riffs, similar to the band's earlier hit \\"The Sun\\". Similar to their previous work, the band often borrows lyrics from influential Chinese novels and poetry. The album's lead single, \\"Ritual of Apotheosis\\", is named for a ritual performed by Chinese emperors during ancient times. The song's lyrics draw from the I Ching, and are about how all individuals must respect and follow the rules of society and nature. \\"Song of the Great Wind\\" is a musical setting of three poems: \\"Reflections on Chang'an\\" by Song-era poet Kang Yuzhi, \\"\\" by Xiang Yu, and the titular poem by Liu Bang, Emperor Gaozu of Han. Romantic Knight was recorded over the course of three months. The album was produced by Yan Zhongkun, who had worked on the band's first album as a mixing engineer.  Tracklisting  Release  Romantic Knight was released on June 13, 2008, and sold 50,000 copies within the first 3-4 months of its release. A collector's edition was also made available for online preorder, which included the album, a bonus DVD containing the five music videos off of Tang Dynasty, a t-shirt, guitar picks, and a mini-poster all contained in a commemorative bag.

History Cadw records the \\"legendary\\" connection between the court and the Early Middle Ages kingdom of Brycheiniog which was located to the north of Monmouthshire in the southern part of the historic county of Brecknockshire. The court dates from the mid-16th century, and was in the ownership of the Nicholls family in the 17th and 18th centuries. The barn, stable and granary were constructed during the Nicholls' ownership. The architectural historian John Newman dates the barn to the 16th century but Cadw suggests a slightly earlier date of the 15th century. Both agree that the stable and granary were later additions.

A member of the aristocratic von Manstein family, he was related to the Second World War-era field marshal Erich von Manstein. He served briefly in the Imperial German Army, during which time he was posted to W√ºrzburg. Whilst there he became involved in the Jewish community and met his Jewish-born wife. He converted to Judaism in 1892 and was disowned by his family. Von Manstein subsequently became a teacher before the rise to power of the Nazi Party in 1933 forced him out of his job. He attempted to emigrate to Palestine but was unable to do so due to the Second World War. After the majority of W√ºrzburg's Jews were deported to concentration camps in the east, von Manstein, who was exempt due to his supposed Aryan origin, made a formal request to join them, but this was denied. He lost his valuable musical instrument collection to the Nazis and was made to live in a single building with the city's remaining Jews. He allegedly recanted his faith, under duress, in October 1942, before falling ill and dying in 1944. The Nazi Party seized his body and he was buried in a non-Jewish cemetery with full military honours, despite the objections of his friends. A post-war campaign led to him being reburied in the Jewish cemetery next to his wife in 1960.  Early life  Ernst Albrecht von Manstein was born on 19 May 1869 at Domersleben, near Magdeburg in the Province of Saxony. The von Manstein family was of Freiherr (baronial) rank and had provided both Prussia and Russia with senior military officers and generals. Erich von Manstein, one of Hitler's most senior generals and later field marshal, was the adopted son of Ernst's brother. Von Manstein grew up in a ranger's lodge and had a keen interest in nature. He was also a gifted musician and after receiving a commission in the 9th Infantry Regiment served in its band.  Conversion to Judaism  Von Manstein's regiment was deployed to W√ºrzburg, Bavaria in 1890. He became acquainted with the city's Jewish community who shared his interest in music and began to attend their religious gatherings and study Judaism. Von Manstein met novelist Franziska Bezold (known as Franny), 19 years his senior, in W√ºrzburg and fell in love with her. She was the orphan of Jewish parents and had been raised as a Christian. The couple married in 1892 and decided to convert to Judaism together in a ceremony in Amsterdam on 13 December 1892. The place of von Manstein's circumcision has been stated as both Amsterdam and in the Jewish (Rothschild) Hospital in Frankfurt. Von Manstein adopted the name of Abraham following his conversion and took to wearing the kippah. His family were displeased with the conversion and broke off all contact with him; he also resigned his army commission. Von Manstein studied art history at the University of Strasbourg before returning to W√ºrzburg to teach drawing and music at the Jewish seminary and at private schools. Von Manstein owned a house with a large garden in Keesburgstrasse. He adhered to the Jewish Halakha laws including the Kil'ayim prohibiting the mixing of seeds, had daily lessons in the Talmud and attended the synagogue three times a day. Von Manstein was a member of the synagogue council and the committees of two Jewish schools. He was prominent in the music scene, being part of a musical quartet and occasionally conducting the city orchestra.  Under Nazi rule  Following the rise to power of the Nazi Party in 1933, von Manstein came under pressure to renounce his faith and sever his connections to the Jewish community, which he refused to do. He had worked as an art teacher, but under the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service of 1933, he was dismissed from his position due to his religion. As increasing numbers of Jews were made homeless by the Nazis, he opened his house to refugees, among them the child Yehuda Amichai, who would later become a famous Israeli poet. Von Manstein was formally certified by the Nazis as being of pure Aryan descent, but Jewish by religion, only on 30 March 1939. Despite the discrimination he experienced, he continued to use the heil greeting until forbidden to do so (and from wearing the colours of the Nazi party) on 13 July. Shortly thereafter, von Manstein sold his house, being intent on moving to Palestine and submitted a formal request to emigrate on 24 November 1939. This permission was granted on 18 April 1940, but was contingent on him relinquishing German citizenship and transferring all his property to the German state. By this time, the Second World War had made any move impossible. Von Manstein subsequently had to move between different rented homes. Franny died in March 1941, and von Manstein arranged for her burial in the city's Jewish cemetery with a headstone designed by him. Approximately 1,500 of W√ºrzburg's Jews were deported to the east, many being sent to the Theresienstadt concentration camp. Von Manstein formally applied to the Nazi authorities to join them, but was refused. Instead, he was placed, along with all of the city's remaining Jews, in a single building on Domerschulstrasse that subsequently became known as the Judenhause. At around this time, von Manstein's valuable collection of musical instruments was destroyed by the Nazi authorities. Von Manstein recanted his Jewish faith on 23 October 1942, apparently under duress. His health deteriorated and he was admitted to the hospital of the Stiftung Juliusspital W√ºrzburg, where he died on 17 January 1944. The Nazi authorities seized his body and held a funeral at the city cemetery with full military honours, including a Nazi swastika flag on his coffin and uniformed SS pallbearers. Some of von Manstein's friends protested this, stating that he would have wanted to be buried alongside his wife in the Jewish cemetery. In 1946, a former W√ºrzburg rabbi, who had emigrated to the United States, began lobbying for his body to be moved to the Jewish cemetery. It took fourteen years before this could be achieved, one obstacle being that no cemetery fees had been paid since the war. Von Manstein was finally interred next to his wife on 22 May 1960.

Weston is a fictional character on the FX television series Sons of Anarchy, played by Henry Rollins. He is one of two main antagonists in season two (the other being Ethan Zobelle) and is a high ranking member of the Aryan Brotherhood. Biography AJ is an extremely violent ex-convict and ardent white supremacist, albeit also being a loving single father of two young sons, Cliff and Duke. =Season 2= Weston moved into Charming along with Ethan Zobelle, who presented himself to the townspeople and local law enforcement as the owner of the newly opened Impeccable Smokes cigar shop on the town's Main Street. Weston and Zobelle's goal is to help the removal of SAMCRO from Charming. To get a foothold in the town, Weston meets with Ernest Darby, the leader of a local neo-Nazi gang called the Nordics. Though he is disgusted by Darby‚Äôs hiring of nonwhite workers, he gives him money to spread their meth and prostitution business into Charming. Zobelle and Weston visit with SAMCRO to threaten the club‚Äôs President, Clay Morrow. When he proves impossible to intimidate, Polly Zobelle, Weston and two other Aryans wearing rubber masks kidnap his wife, Gemma Teller Morrow, and chain her to a fence. The AB members beat her, and gang rape her. Weston tells her to deliver a message to Clay to stop selling guns to ‚Äúniggers and wetbacks,‚Äù or they would find her and do it again. Weston and Zobelle meet with Cameron Hayes, SAMCRO‚Äôs Irish gun supplier, and convince him to sell guns to them instead. Meanwhile, SAMCRO breaks into his house, frightening his children and stealing his laptop. They hack into his computer and find out about a meeting at the Morada Christian Center. When they attack the supposed AB recruitment rally, which is actually a Christian family dinner, Weston fires off a gun to cause a panic and make the Sons look even worse. Weston and Zobelle give up the addresses of the Nordics‚Äô meth lab and brothel to Hale. Afterwards, Weston, Ule, and several other Aryans go with Darby to burn down SAMCRO‚Äôs porn studio, Cara Cara. They officially break ties with the Nordics, knocking out Darby and leaving him to die in the fire. However, Chuck Marstein witnesses the arson and hears Weston‚Äôs name. By this point, Ule has effectively supplanted Weston as Zobelle‚Äôs lieutenant, and, behind Weston‚Äôs back, the two have begun dealing heroin with the Mayans. SAMCRO informs Weston of this, enraging him. He shuts down the heroin distribution center, killing two Hispanic cookers and shooting Ule in the head. Weston confronts Zobelle at gunpoint, effectively severing the AB‚Äôs ties to L.O.A.N., but leaves immediately after receiving a phone call from his son, Cliff. He arrives just in time to see his kids being taken away by child protective services after being alerted by SAMCRO. Enraged, Weston challenges Jax Teller to a ten-on-ten brawl to the death in the woods. He attempts to break the rules by showing up with twenty armed Aryans, but is quickly checked by Jax‚Äôs reinforcements - the One-Niners and the Lin Triad. They then start the fistfight they had agreed upon, with Weston directly engaging Jax Teller and brutally holding his own. The melee is broken up by Hale, who arrests Weston for arson. Zobelle and Polly are arrested for heroin possession and placed in a cell next to Weston. Because the arson witness is unreliable, Weston is released, but not before Chief Wayne Unser informs him that Zobelle is an FBI informant. Weston calls Polly and tells her that her father is a dead man. Weston is allowed to go on a supervised visit with Duke (Cliff is in psychiatric evaluation), and takes him to a tattoo parlor. The tattoo artist, Irish Freddy, who is in league with SAMCRO and is visibly offended by Weston‚Äôs ‚ÄúI Kill Niggers‚Äù tattoo, ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù stabs him with the needle and tells him to wash it off in the bathroom. He does, and walks directly into an ambush. Weston‚Äôs main priority is keeping his son safe, and is allowed to give him some final words. Weston tells him to never talk to the cops and sends him away, willing to allow himself to be killed if his son never sees his corpse. Jax Teller nods in agreement and AJ Weston calmly sits on a toilet, bowing his head. Jax shoots him six times with a silenced pistol, killing him. Reception IGN gave the second season an 8.4/10.0 rating, giving praise to Henry Rollins' character, AJ Weston, saying, \\"A decidedly stronger second season sees the gang unravel and knit back together.\\" His death was voted #2 on IGN's list of Sons of Anarchy's Best Deaths ahead of the airing of the show's third season.

According to media reports, the objective of the operation was the assassination of Die Linke party leader Dietmar Bartsch and other left-leaning politicians. Information about the plot came to law enforcement attention in 2017 during the investigation of a different alleged plot by German military officers to assassinate the President of Germany. The planned killings were made public in November 2018. Background Between 2008 and 2017, Germany's Military Counter-intelligence Service (MAD) identified roughly 200 right-wing extremists within the Bundeswehr. In April 2017, German prosecutors charged a 28-year-old German Army soldier and two others with plotting a wave of violent attacks against left-leaning German politicians that would be framed on asylum seekers. \\"Franco A.\\", a lieutenant, had allegedly planned to target President of Germany Joachim Gauck, Heiko Maas, Claudia Roth, and unnamed \\"human rights activists and journalists\\". He was purportedly aided by another soldier, named only as \\"Maxilimilian T.\\" and a university student named as \\"Mathias F.\\" According to authorities, a search of \\"Franco A.\\"s quarters also revealed his possession of Wehrmacht memorabilia and, it was also learned, his master's degree thesis advanced what was described as v√∂lkisch arguments and theories. In November of that year, the Federal Court of Justice ordered \\"Franco A.\\" released, ruling that \\"the results so far of the investigation do not substantiate the strong suspicion that a serious act threatening the state was in preparation\\". Alleged plot In September 2017, prior to \\"Franco A.\\"'s release, Federal Criminal Police officers searched the barracks of the German Army's elite Special Forces Command (KSK) in Calw. The search occurred after information obtained in the investigation of \\"Franco A.\\" indicated that \\"Franco A.\\" might have had contact with KSK commandos. Police were unable to find evidence of subversive activity during the search but suspected the KSK soldiers had been tipped off before their arrival. On 9 November 2018, Focus first publicly reported on the investigation. According to it, the inquiry had uncovered a potential conspiracy within the KSK designed to murder Dietmar Bartsch and other unnamed politicians on an operational date designated Day X. Day X was intended to coincide with the collapse of the German Government, an event the alleged conspirators felt was imminent and inevitable due to communal tension related to the country's growing refugee population. In addition to the Federal Criminal Police, Deutschlandfunk has reported that the German domestic security agency, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, is also investigating the matter. =Arrests= According to authorities, the earlier alleged tip-off to potential KSK conspirators had been made by a lieutenant colonel in MAD who alerted the soldiers about the raid on their barracks in advance of it occurring. Police apparently learned of this due to an informant, \\"Andr√© S.\\", placed within the KSK. The MAD double agent, named in charging documents as \\"Peter W.\\", was subsequently indicted in a Cologne Amtsgericht on unspecified charges related to his alleged interference.

She and her family had a long history of photography and camera work. Later on in her childhood, she was sent to Saint Dominique Monastery in Haiphong. In 1944, her family moved to H·∫£i D∆∞∆°ng. At the age of 16, she followed the Viet Minh, participated in the general uprising and \\"joined women in national salvation in H·∫£i D∆∞∆°ng and then worked in the Provincial Association and the inter- provincial affairs III\\". In 1955, she moved to work at Nh√¢n D√¢n, head of the Hanoi team, responsible for information about the city.‚Äù  Career  B·∫°ch Di·ªáp took a film class in 1959 and attended the Movie School at the Ministry of Culture and Information. She was trained by Russian cinematographers and film experts, known as the East Bloc artists such as Ajdai Ibraghimov, an Azerbaijanian from the Soviet Union. B·∫°ch Di·ªáp‚Äôs career went well into her 80s. She passed away in 2013. Although she formally retired in 1992, she continued to guide others as a film collaborator.NLD.COM.VN. ‚ÄúNSND B·∫°ch Di·ªáp: M·ªôt ƒê·ªùi S·ªëng Cho ƒêi·ªán ·∫¢nh.‚Äù https://nld.com.vn, August 18, 2013. https://nld.com.vn/c1020n20130818101640704.htm. She was still fascinated with filmmaking despite dealing with cancer. She was invited to make a TV Series for Vietnamese Television. Diep made films for the 7th Dimension Cinema and Sunday Arts. B·∫°ch Di·ªáp is credited for the creation of fifteen films, with two being very notable - Ng√†y L·ªÖ Th√°nh (The Holy Day) (1976) and Huy·ªÅn Tho·∫°i V·ªÅ Ng∆∞·ªùi M·∫π (The Legend of a Mother) (1987).Sarker, Sonita, and Esha Niyogi De. ‚ÄúThe Question of Women in Vietnamese Nationalism.‚Äù In Trans-Status Subjects: Gender in the Globalization of South and Southeast Asia, 344. Duke University Press, 2002. 111.  Style and themes  B·∫°ch Di·ªáp was noted to explore the \\"innermost feelings of characters\\" in most of her films. Di·ªáp tries to display emotional journeys through the narrative plots of her film and shows the emotional dilemmas that characters have to face. For example, in Tr·ª´ng Ph·∫°t (Punishment) (1983), Di·ªáp depicts the \\"remorse of US-backed Vietnamese Soldiers through the interactions that the Vietnamese soldiers have with the US. Film scholars refer to her work as \\"something meaningful and new to cinematic arts.\\" She follows the turmoils of most female/women characters such as mothers in Huy·ªÅn Tho·∫°i V·ªÅ Ng∆∞·ªùi M·∫π (The Legend of a Mother) (1987). In The Legend of a Mother (1987), the audience follows a revolutionary woman by the name of H∆∞∆°ng and how H∆∞∆°ng‚Äôs husband dies in the war.John Charlot. ‚ÄúVietnam, The Strangers Meet: The Vietnam Film Project,‚Äù ‚ÄúFilms of the Pacific.‚Äù In Hawai ªi International Film Festival, November 27‚ÄìDecember 3, 1988, 44‚Äì49, 84‚Äì87. Honolulu: The East-West Center, 1988. The film also depicts H∆∞∆°ng as midwife at a hospital and eventually as the adoptive mother to three children whose mother (also women soldiers) went missing or died in the war. The Legend of a Mother (1987) shows themes of how Vietnamese culture places significant importance to \\"folk devotion to the dead\\" meaning in Vietnamese culture, there are elaborate and traditions when remembering those who passed. In The Legend of a Mother (1987), Di·ªáp shows the dual nature of the \\"revolutionary mother\\" and deconstructs the national concept of what it means to be \\"a mother\\". Di·ªáp extends the concept of motherhood beyond \\"physical maternity and immediate kinship to the nurturance and protection of children.\\" The Legend of a Mother (1987) challenges patriarchal family views by reasserting what it means to be parents to children. Post-war film typically will draw on historical legacy and historical events to try and create a sense of nationalized patriotic duty. B·∫°ch Di·ªáp follows this style heavily in The Legend of a Mother (1987).  Personal life  In various news articles recording B·∫°ch Di·ªáp's live after her death at 85 in 2013, other artists are interviewed and state how much Di·ªáp has impacted them critically with her films and her work with them. Di·ªáp was diagnosed with cancer and struggled with it until she passed away in her hometown of H√† N·ªôi. Di·ªáp lived with the Vietnamese poet, Xu√¢n Di·ªáu, for a few years but ultimately split up. She later lived with and married Nguy·ªÖn ƒê·ª©c T∆∞·ªùng and the marriage lasted for 15 years. The two had no children.

It was designed by Walter Liberty Vernon and built from 1902 to 1909. It is also known as Mining Museum (former), Earth Exchange and Sydney Geological and Mining Museum. The property is owned by Property NSW, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002.  History  Late 18th century maps and plans of the area indicate that the site was not occupied by any buildings or other human structures. In 1807 Meehan's map includes the site within a larger parcel of land bounded by High Street (now George Street) and the northern end of Sydney Cove, with the reference \\"leased to Robert Campbell Esquire\\" along with two adjoining parcels of land, one to the south, and the other on the western side of High Street. By 1902 the site of an old quarry that had otherwise not been developed before. Between 1902 and 2004 the lower part of the subject building constructed on the site for a power station and workshops. In 1908 the site vested in Mines Department. Between 1908 and 2009 the upper levels of the subject building constructed for a mining museum and chemical laboratories. In 1901 the Plan of Sydney in Fitzgerald's Royal Commission indicates the present site boundaries. In 1902 plans were drawn by Government Architect Walter Vernon for an Electric Light Station and Workshop. The plan shows six level structure facing George Street and a similar structure facing Hickson Road, with an octagonal chimney stack on the northern side, and an attic level behind Romanesque style parapets and gabled roofs. In 1903, revised plans drawn by Vernon for the Electric Light Station and Workshop now shows a two level structure facing George Street and a three levels high structure facing Hickson Road, with an octagonal chimney stack in height on the northern side, and simple gabled roofs. Between 1902 and 2004 the lower part of the building constructed on the site for a power station and workshops but and left unfinished and roofless, with the generating equipment never installed. By 1908 the site was vested in the NSW Mines Department. Between 1908 and 1909 the upper levels of the subject building constructed for a mining museum and chemical laboratories, and a new entrance into George Street, with the Mining Museum opening in August 1909. By 1930 the Julian Ashton Art School moved into the vacant first floor. A museum shop was established in 1972; and in the following year the Julian Ashton Art School moved out of the building. In 1987 refurbishment plans launched but later delayed until 1989, when the building was transferred to the Geological and Mining Museum Trust, and the name changed to The Earth Exchange. In 1991 the Earth Exchange opened in March; and by 1996 the museum closed permanently.Tropman 1996: 4-8; Appendix A Since 1996, the building has been fitted out for offices. Archaeological History - Land occupied by Cunnyngehams shipyard by 1840s. Current structure originally constructed as a DC Electricity Power Station between 1902-07. The building is illustrative of the then debate on electricity supply, DC current being strongly, and stubbornly, supported by Thomas Edison. Generally however AC power was universally adopted and this power station was never put into action. In 1909 it became the Mining Museum and remained so until 1995 (by which time it was known as the Earth Exchange). Since then it has generally been vacant with various proposals by the NSW Ministry for the Arts.  Description  The building is a former electrical power station; built between 1902 and 1909. The principal building on the site is the Former Mining Museum and Chemical Laboratory, consisting of a six-storey building and a detached high chimney stack, which has been recessed into the side of the rectangular plan of the building. The building addresses two roadways, George Street and Hickson Road. It would appear that considerable bedrock has been excavated to George Street which is approximately three storeys above Hickson Road to facilitate the building on the site. The Former Mining Museum and Chemical Laboratory building has a direct relationship with Circular Quay, George Street and Hickson Road. Positioned between these two important roadways, the building dominates the immediate precinct with its impressive chimney stack, large building scale and its fine proportions. Generally, the building is constructed with a combination of sandstone, brick and rendered facades. The roof is composed of a series of gable roofs, with central sawtooth roof lights. The internal construction is chiefly rolled steel column and beam structure with various sections concrete slab and timber floor construction. Brick chimney - high and foundations. Style: Federation Warehouse with some distinctive Art Nouveau and Romanesque detailing.; Storeys: Five+ basement; Facade: Combination of sandstone, brick and rendered facades.; Side Rear Walls: Sandstone, brick and recent plasterboard; Internal Walls: Sandstone, brick and recent plasterboard; Floor Frame: Concrete slab and timber.; Ceilings: Plasterboard lining; Sprinkler System: Fire sprinkler system located in roof space.; Lifts: Brick lift well (south end of the building) = Condition = As at 3 May 2001, Archaeology Assessment Condition: Destroyed. Assessment Basis: Basements below George Street. Terraced into hill slope from Hickson Road. = Modifications and dates = *1902-1904The lower part *1908-1909The upper levels *1990Major internal works were carried out for the reopening of the building as the Earth Exchange.SCRA, Annual Report, 1990: 19  Heritage listing  As at 30 March 2011, the Mining Museum and site are of State heritage significance for their historical and scientific cultural values. The site and building are also of State heritage significance for their contribution to The Rocks area which is of State Heritage significance in its own right. The former Mining Museum and Chemical Laboratory site and building is principally significant for its historical and aesthetic significance. It demonstrates the continuous significant human activity of collecting mineral and geological objects of economic and intellectual interest, carried out for almost 90 years on this site. It is an excellent example of the Federation Warehouse style with good proportions and distinctive Romanesque and Art Nouveau detailing. It was designed by a very prominent Federation Period architect, Walter Liberty Vernon, who was the first NSW Government Architect. The design is a well considered and executed approach to the site. The building reflects the early 20th century development phase of The Rocks after the Government resumption. It is significant as an early 20th century museum building illustrating important external and internal design features. It is a very distinctive building with landmark qualities to the local area, The Rocks and Circular Quay. The place is also significant because: It is associated with numerous significant historical events at world, national and state level. It is representative of an educational and research activity that was continuous from the turn of the century to recent times in NSW. The chimney stack is a rare surviving feature in Sydney and has a high level of integrity. The building is a rare example of and inner city building that was originally designed and partially constructed as a power station and then redesigned and completed as a Museum and Chemical Laboratory. The building was associated with electricity generation supply and distribution in Sydney. It is representative of the decision to generally change from direct current (DC) supply to alternating current (AC) supply in NSW.Tropman 1996: 15 Mining Museum was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The building has historical significance as a place that demonstrates the significant human activity of collecting mineral and geological objects of economic and intellectual interest, and is associated with six significant events and at least one significant person, Walter Liberty Vernon. It is representative of both turn of the century power station and museum buildings, and is rare example of a building especially converted for activities associated with museum for collecting, curating and exhibiting the objects of a particular human activity, mining. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The building is aesthetically distinctive. The building and chimney stack are very distinctive in form, style and detailing. The subject site and building, particularly the chimney stack, is very prominent in The Rocks and Circular Quay and is distinctly a strong visual feature to the local area. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The subject site and building have a special cultural, social and educational value as a former Mining Museum an Chemical Laboratories, responsible for collecting, collating, displaying and researching minerals and geological objects. It was also responsible for educating various peoples from Miners to the General Public with different degrees of detail about minerals and geological objects. This association with the site began in 1908 and continued until 1995. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. It is an important benchmark and reference type. As an original planned D C Power Station and later as a constructed public institution - a mining museum and chemical laboratory. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. This item is assessed as aesthetically rare statewide.

He served in the Michigan Senate in the early years of Michigan's statehood, and later in the Michigan House of Representatives.  Early life and travels  John ClarkeHis name is spelled in some sources as Clark , and in others as Clarke ; the latter spelling is used on his tombstone . was born in Bath, Maine, on July 29, 1797. He was the son of George Collins Clarke, a ship-builder and sea captain, and Mary McDonald. He left school at age 15 to become a clerk in a store in Augusta, Maine, and at age 18 his physician suggested he travel to help improve his poor health. The War of 1812 had just ended and it was again safe to travel, so Clarke sailed to Bremen, Germany. He traveled through Germany, England, and Scotland, before embarking for Boston aboard the ship Ellington along with his uncle. The ship foundered during a gale in the mid-Atlantic, and the passengers and crew were forced into the ship's small boats for three days. A Scottish brig picked them up, and they stayed on it for three more days before the James Madison arrived to deliver them to Philadelphia 32 days later. In Philadelphia, he was separated from his uncle and wandered for three days with no money or food before his uncle found him and paid for him to return home. He worked again as a clerk in a store in Hallowell, Maine, before moving to Belfast, Maine, in 1818, and operating a mercantile business. Clarke was an avid supporter of the Democratic-Republican Party and performed a variety of duties for the party, although he refused to accept a political position. He worked for the election of Andrew Jackson in the election of 1824, which Jackson lost when the House of Representatives elected John Quincy Adams. Clarke's health began to deteriorate again and he closed his business, but remained active in political circles. After Jackson's election as president in 1828, Clarke met him while in Washington, D.C., on business, and the two became close friends.  Life in Michigan  He moved to Detroit in 1830 and opened a mercantile business near the corner of Woodward and Jefferson Avenues. In 1832, he bought a large tract of land in China, Michigan, on the St. Clair River, and moved to Port Huron. During this time, he worked as the captain of a steamboat that traveled between Toledo and Port Huron, the General Gratiot, and in 1835 he moved to the property he owned in China, where he built a dock and a store and engaged in trading. The first town meeting in China Township after it was established on March 21, 1835, was held at Clarke's house. Clarke was a delegate to the state constitutional convention in 1835, was elected to the Michigan Senate in the first elections under the new constitution, and was re-elected to two additional terms. Although Michigan had a constitution, its admission to the union was blocked due to an ongoing dispute with Ohio known as the Toledo War. Clarke went to Washington at the request of several influential residents of Michigan Territory to present an argument in favor of statehood to President Jackson. When other representatives made their cases, Jackson told them, \\"You have no influence with the Cabinet. We look to Mr. Clarke for all the information we desire. We know him, and have the fullest confidence in him.\\" Secretary of State John Forsyth told Clarke he could have any gift he wanted from the president, but Clarke declined to pursue an appointed office. Friends asked Clarke to put his name in nomination for the United States Senate, but he refused. President Jackson appointed him in 1837 as one of two commissioners charged with acquiring the title of Native American lands in Michigan. He served as a supervisor for China Township from 1847 to 1848, and was a delegate again to the state constitutional convention of 1850. Clarke left the Democratic Party following the nomination of James Buchanan in 1856, and joined the Republicans as a supporter of John C. Fr√©mont. He served a term in the Michigan House of Representatives from 1857 to 1858.  Family and personal life  Clarke married Mary Sherbun of Hallowell in December 1819. They had a daughter named Emeline. He was a Freemason and a Knight Templar, and petitioned for the creation of a commandery in St. Clair, Michigan, which thereafter was named the \\"John Clark Commandery\\". Clarke died on February 3, 1876, and is buried in Rosehill Cemetery in St. Clair.

It was built from 1890 to 1899. It is also known as Hart's Buildings. The property is owned by Property NSW, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002.  History  Throughout the 19th and 20th century the land generally bounded by Cumberland Street, Cahill Expressway, Gloucester Street and Essex Street, including the subject site, was occupied by a number of dwellings and shops that housed a largely working-class community. Little is known about the people who lived here prior to the 1830s, however, from 1839 when all formal claims for land and grants were made, the population increased. The site is part of Allotment 14 of City Section 70 originally granted to Elizabeth Thompson on the 19 April 1839. The 1838 Robert Russell plan shows Allotment 14 with narrow frontage to Essex Street, extending along Gloucester Street. The claimant is noted as the late James Thompson. It would appear that Elizabeth subsequently subdivided the site. A plan of Section 70 shows Allotment 14 divided into two parcels, with the subject site located in the south eastern corner of the section which is generally bounded by Cumberland, Little Essex (formerly Essex Lane), Gloucester and Essex Streets. It is not clear if the Thompsons developed the site in any way, however, in October 1843 the land was conveyed to Mr N. Bray. Bray may have developed the site from this time, in 1849 he took out a mortgage to Mr John Minton Hart. The 1865 Trig Survey plan shows that the site was occupied by a regular shaped structure constructed to the Gloucester Street alignment by this time. Two detached structures are also shown constructed to the rear, western site boundary. In 1875 the land was purchased by William Daley. The plan on the Land Title dated November 1877 also shows the building on the site, with frontage to Gloucester Street. A party wall is clearly indicated on the plan, along the north eastern site boundary. A small detached structure occupies the north western corner of the site. The site was subsequently transferred three times in 1879 and in early 1880 was part of a parcel of land extending along Essex Street transferred to Peter Francis Hart, a builder. The plan on this land title indicates the same building footprint seen on the earlier plans. In the same year the land was transferred to Elizabeth Hart. The Percy Dove plan of 1880 shows the two, one storey dwellings facing Gloucester Street, Nos. 153 and 155. A small structure is attached to the rear of No. 153. Another single storey structure is also shown on the Essex Street frontage, at the south western corner of the site. This building is numbered No.10 and is surrounded by open yard. It would appear that it was slightly setback from its neighbour to the west, No. 8 Essex Street, another single storey structure noted as being occupied by a bootmaker. The adjoining building at No. 6, also noted as being a single storey building, was occupied by a grocer. These details were transferred to a detail sheet dated December 1887. This plan was subsequently revised in September 1895, by which time new buildings are shown occupying the site. The buildings, shown hatched, are constructed to the Gloucester and Essex Street boundaries, with three open yards along the northern site boundary which also featured small timber, attached structures. The main building was constructed in brick. The structures that formerly occupied the site and stair from Gloucester Street are also indicated, however, are crossed out on the plan. It would also appear that the rock face was also cut back to the Gloucester Street building line. Based on these plans, it would appear that the buildings were constructed sometime between 1887 and 1895. It is assumed that they were constructed in 1892. Nos. 153 and 155 Gloucester Street are listed in the Sands Directory until 1892. Nos. 12 and 14 Essex Street are also listed in the Sands at this time, however, are listed to the east of Gloucester Street. Nos. 10, 12a and 14a, however, on the western side of Gloucester Street, are first listed in 1893. The Sands indicates that the street number subsequently changed and the subject buildings became Nos. 10, 12 and 14 by 1898. The buildings generally responded to the irregular shape of the site and were constructed on the original rock ledges that characterise the area. Unlike the previous building that occupied the site, the buildings were constructed with frontage to Essex Street and stepped down the grade of the street, which falls to the east, toward George Street. It is not clear why the Essex Street address was preferred, possibly to allow northern aspect to the rear of the buildings. However, housing constructed in The Rocks by this time were not orientated towards the harbour and Essex Street may have lost is association with the gallows and old Gaol by this time. The buildings were also constructed to the northern and western site boundaries, abutting the existing neighbouring buildings along Gloucester and Essex Streets streetscapes, with only small open yards provided along the northern boundary. It is assumed that the north eastern party wall from the earlier development on the site was retained and new buildings constructed to it and the single storey building to its north, No. 151 Gloucester Street. The wall is exposed today and the shadow line of the gable roof, the height of a single storey structure constructed on a rock ledge is evident. This building was subsequently replaced by two storey terraces constructed by the NSW Housing Board in -13. The 1895 field survey notes indicate a typical type of housing for this period, with rear tunnel back form. Terraces had long being an accepted form in The Rocks with land speculators looking to maximise inner city sites, with no front gardens or setback from the street and restricted open spaces. The buildings also show reference to building codes introduced decades earlier with the incorporation of party walls which extended beyond the roof planes of the buildings. The external form illustrated and inspection of the buildings today suggest that internally the buildings also featured typical internal layout with two main rooms on the first and second floor with smaller room on both levels in the rear tunnel back. It is assumed that the three upper rooms were accessed via a stair extending up the party walls and returning into the building. The first floor level was typically split to allow access to each of the three first floor rooms. Another narrow stair extended from the first floor to the roof in each of the terraces. Only one of these stairs remains (in No. 14) today. In 1900 the buildings were resumed under the Darling Harbour Resumption Act and came under the responsibility of the Sydney Harbour Trust. Despite resumption and change of ownership, the buildings appear to have retained their original form into the early decades of the twentieth century. A Sydney Water plan dated 1911 also shows the original form and suggests that no external change had been undertaken to the buildings with the open areas across the northern site boundary clearly evident. It also indicates that the buildings to the north of the site, along the Gloucester Street frontage were demolished about this time to make way for the proposed terrace of 17 houses about to be erected by the Public Works Department at Nos. 127-152a Gloucester Street. The plan also shows a lane extending across the western site boundary and rear of the terrace sites and buildings facing Cumberland Street. This is consistent with a number of housing schemes following the cleansing operations of the early 1900s and preparations for the construction of the Sydney Harbour Bridge which displaced a considerable percentage of the local population. The Housing Board notified City Council in October 1912 that before work commenced on the premises at Nos. 127-152a Gloucester Street, the premises at Nos. 6 and 8 Essex Street would be demolished once the tenant was vacated. It is assumed that Nos. 6 and 8 were demolished in 1912. The Gloucester Street terraces were demolished in 1987, and site was used as a car park prior to its redevelopment in the late 1980s. A plaque in the building today notes that the buildings were occupied by Margaret Fulton, a celebrated cookery author, and her family between the years of 1954 and 1968. The buildings were unoccupied for several years before their use as a temporary site office for the adjoining development of the D2 site (north eastern corner of Essex and Gloucester Streets) in the 1980s.  Description  This property comprises three, two storey stuccoed brick terraced houses erected in the first decades of the 20th century. They are located in Essex Street, on the western side of Gloucester Street intersection. The three buildings are located hard on both the Essex and Gloucester Street frontages resulting in relatively plain and unadorned facades. They are designed in a restrained Federation Arts and Crafts style characterised by the cornice, string course and castellated skyline formed by the roof level balustrades and chimneys. To the rear each house is planned with a typical, two storey \\"tunnel back\\" arrangement. The remaining space at the ground floor has been infilled. Internal planning originally included a typical entry corridor leading to a stair passage along the party wall. The stairs originally continued to roof level in a small enclosure, giving access for maintenance.Schwager Brooks 1989: 17-18 Style: Federation Arts & Crafts; Storeys: Two; Facade: Brick; Internal Walls: Finished with lime plaster; Roof Cladding: Corrugated iron; Floor Frame: Timber; Roof Frame: Timber = Condition = As at 27 April 2001, Archaeology Assessment Condition: Partly disturbed. Assessment Basis: Area under building only. Terraced into hill slope. Investigation: Excavation. = Modifications and dates = Of all the buildings on the Lilyvale site, these buildings have undergone the greatest change, and most of it in recent years. The houses have conventional terraced plans but are unusual in the way they respond to the trapezoidal nature of their site. The buildings were taken over on a temporary basis as a site office by the construction team associated with the adjacent development.Schwager Brooks 1989: 25-26  Heritage listing  As at 30 March 2011, Harts Building and site are of State heritage significance for their historical and scientific cultural values. The site and building are also of State heritage significance for their contribution to The Rocks area which is of State Heritage significance in its own right. Harts Buildings, Nos. 10-14 Essex Street, are of State and local heritage significance for their historical, aesthetic and scientific cultural values. The site and buildings are highly significant as part of a grouping of 19th century development remaining in this precinct that represent the residential built development and its evolution in the period between 1840 and 1900. The buildings provide evidence of the building practices of the 1890s and remain as good examples of speculative housing constructed in . The buildings retain classical, late Victorian detailing, however, their solid construction and decoration of the parapet also indicate the prosperity and confidence of the time leading up to the construction of the buildings. The buildings occupy a prominent corner site and are significant in the way that the building form and massing respond to the site conditions and demonstrate the topography and character of The Rocks. The buildings are amongst a few 19th century developments remaining in the area south of the Cahill Expressway and contribute to the diversity of the Essex and Gloucester streetscapes. The buildings are prominent elements in the Essex Street streetscape primarily due to their corner location and modest scale, which is contrast to the surrounding development. They are one of two survivors of the pre 1900 development in Essex Street and make a positive contribution to the varied character and historical nature of the precinct. The adaptation of the buildings represents the evolution of the area and shift away from residential use. Their use as part of the Hotel complex and leisure activities in the area represents the shift in the use of the area and provides opportunity for interpretation and appreciation of the buildings. Harts Buildings was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Harts Buildings are historically significant as part of the late 19th century development in The Rocks' precinct located south of the Cahill Expressway. With the adjacent Butchery Buildings and Lilyvale Cottage they form a grouping of small scale residential and commercial development that importantly demonstrates the evolution of the area from 1840 to the turn of the 20th century. The buildings were constructed as speculative residential accommodation that despite changes of ownership and management continued in their original function for nearly 100 years. The buildings significantly were constructed to maximise the site and standard terrace house form adapted to suit the irregular site boundaries and topography of the area. The adaptation of the buildings in the early 1990s represents the shift of the use and evolution of the area from a residential precinct to a tourist and commercial area which began in the early decades of the 20th century. As such Harts Buildings make a positive contribution to The Rocks and meets this criterion on a State level. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The buildings are associated with Peter Hart, a local builder who constructed the buildings which now bear his name. The buildings have subsequently been associated with a number of local residents and occupants including Margaret Fulton, a well known and highly regarded cookery writer who occupied part of the building during the late 1950s and early 1960s. The buildings have been associated with the Sydney Harbour Trust, who became responsible for the buildings in , Maritime Services Board, Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority and Sydney Harbour Foreshore Authority. The buildings are also now associated with the Shangri-La (former ANA) Hotel and part of the tourist and commercial enterprise in the area. Harts Buildings meet this criterion on a local level. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Harts Buildings, Nos. 10-14 Essex Street, are three terrace houses constructed in . The buildings generally feature restrained classical detailing which illustrates the simple, late Victorian style with little ornamentation and incorporation of standard building techniques and finishes which reflects the speculative nature of the overall development. The buildings occupy a prominent corner and are highly visible elements in the Essex Street streetscape. Their modest scale is in contrast with much of the surrounding development and together with the Butchery Buildings and Lilyvale Cottage, form a grouping of late 19th century buildings which demonstrate the historic character of the area. These buildings are of significance as the only survivors from this period (1840s to 1890s) in the block bounded by the Cahill Expressway, Cumberland, Essex and Gloucester Streets. The architectural configuration and layout is typical of terrace housing of the period, however, like other buildings in The Rocks, have been adapted to suit the irregular site parameters and topography of the site. The massing and form of the buildings, construction to the street frontage and lack of open space around the buildings represents the shift in the style and perception of residential accommodation that became prevalent from the 1870s as the area became more developed and densely populated. Harts Buildings meet this criterion on a local level. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Harts Buildings have no strong or special association with any particular community or cultural groups, however, were part of a primarily residential and small scale commercial precinct that developed after the relocation of the Old Gaol from George Street in the early 1840s. As such they were associated with a number of occupants and tenants who were part of a closely knit working class neighbourhood. The alterations and adaptation of the buildings represents a shift in the use of the building and area in general. The buildings are now part of an active commercial community and busy tourist precinct and popular venue for leisure activities for the local workers and tourists alike. Harts Buildings meet this criterion on a local level. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Harts Buildings, Nos. 10-14 Essex Street, is largely intact, and despite alterations and adaptation of the building remains as an example of terraces constructed during the 1890s and retains a sense of the domestic standards and spatial qualities can be interpreted in the building fabric. The buildings clearly demonstrate how the terraces of the later half of the 19th century responded to site conditions and the rock ledges that typified the early character of The Rocks. With the neighbouring Butchery Buildings and Lilyvale Cottage, the buildings demonstrate the architecture, domestic and commercial attitudes of the period between 1840 and 1900 in NSW. As such Harts Buildings satisfy this criterion on a State level. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. There are a number of dwellings and terraces dating from a similar period remaining in The Rocks, however, these vary in scale and detail and do not have the distinctive crenellated parapet. The buildings are relatively rare in that they respond to the site and retain evidence of the earlier topography and rocky ledges of The Rocks which can be interpreted in the way the buildings step down the slope of Essex Street and by the cut rock base of the buildings along the Gloucester Street frontage. Nos. 10-14 Essex Street is of State significance as one of a few 19th century, small scale residential buildings remaining in the area south of the Cahill Expressway with the Butchery Buildings, Lilyvale and terraces at the southern end of Cumberland Street, they form a significant grouping. As such, Harts Buildings meet this criterion on a State level. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Despite adaptation and alterations to the buildings, they retain their original external character and a sense of their original internal layout and remain as examples of late 19th century terrace houses. The buildings meet this criterion on a local level.

Life The Kingdom of Chen (roughly present-day Zhoukou, Henan) was a fiefdom granted to Liu Xian (ÂäâÁæ®), the second son of the Emperor Ming of Han. Liu Chong, son of Liu Cheng (ÂäâÊâø), was a great-grandson of Liu Xian. Liu Chong was described to be an energetic character who was skilled with the crossbow, even authoring a treatise on the subject, Nushe Bifa (Âº©Â∞ÑË¢êÊ≥ï). In 173, Liu Chong and his former chancellor Wei Yin (È≠èÊÑî) were accused by the new Chen chancellor Shi Qian (Â∏´ÈÅ∑) for inappropriately making sacrifices to deities seeking for fortunes beyond their ranks. This was impiety (‰∏çÈÅì), the most serious of crimes under the Han dynasty and tantamount to treason. Both Wei Yin and his accuser Shi Qian were brought to the capital of Luoyang in cage-carts for questioning. The eunuch Wang Fu presided over the investigations, and found that while the ceremonies made to Huang‚ÄìLao had been improper, there were no grounds for charges of impiety against Liu Chong and Wei Yin. Shi Qian had thus falsely accused his lord and was himself guilty of impiety, and in the end both Shi Qian and Wei Yin were executed. Emperor Ling, having just exterminated the family of Liu Kui (ÂäâÊÇù) the Prince of Bohai (Ê∏§Êµ∑Áéã) on similar charges, closed the case against Liu Chong in order to avoid more bloodshed in the imperial household. When the Yellow Turban Rebellion broke out in 184, many of Liu Chong's peers were chased out of their fiefs, but Liu Chong raised a force of several thousand archers and fortified himself in his capital. His formidable reputation kept the populace in line, and the Chen state was unscathed by the rebellion. In 190, when a coalition was being formed against the warlord Dong Zhuo who had taken control of the imperial court, Liu Chong rallied troops in support of the coalition and styled himself the General who Supports the Han (ËºîÊº¢Â∞áËªç). He moved his troops north to Yangxia commandery (ÈôΩÂ§è; present-day Taikang County) to join the anti-Dong Zhuo blockade, but as the coalition fell apart and its leaders began to fight amongst themselves, Liu Chong returned to Chen. Under the leadership of Liu Chong and his chancellor Luo Jun (Èß±‰øä; father of Luo Tong), the kingdom of Chen became an oasis of peace and prosperity as China descended into civil war, taking in over a hundred thousand refugees from neighbouring territories. In 197, Yuan Shu declared himself emperor in Shouchun, south of Chen across the Huai River. This audacious action made him a target of the other warlords. After being defeated by the forces of L√º Bu, Yuan Shu could not feed his army and requested supplies from the Chen fief. However, he was rebuffed by Luo Jun, and Yuan Shu responded by sending an assassin to kill both Luo Jun and Liu Chong. With the two leading figures dead, the kingdom of Chen fell into ruin.

Edwards (13 August 1888 ‚Äì 29 September 1957) taught Chinese language and Chinese literature at SOAS, University of London from 1921 to 1955, and was head of the Department of the Far East from 1937 to 1953. She was the third Professor of Chinese at SOAS, from 1939 to 1947, following J. Percy Bruce (1925‚Äì1931) and Reginald Johnston (1931‚Äì1937), and the first female professor of Chinese anywhere in the Western world. Biography Edwards was born 13 August 1888, the third daughter of a vicar, John Edwards (1857‚Äì1934). She went to school at Redbrooke College in Camborne, Cornwall, and later studied at Islington College in London. She then prepared for missionary work by taking a course at St Colm's College in Edinburgh, and in 1913 went to China as a missionary. After arriving in China, Edwards studied Chinese at the Peking Language School, and continued studying whilst working as a missionary, obtaining a Diploma in Mandarin and Classical Chinese from the school in 1918. From 1915 to 1919 she held a position as principal of the Women's Normal College in Mukden, but she returned to England in 1919. Edwards joined the staff at the newly-founded School of Oriental Studies (later School of Oriental and African Studies or SOAS) in 1921 as a lecturer, but as she lacked formal qualifications she was not registered as a \\"recognised teacher\\" until 1929. Whilst teaching full-time at SOAS she also studied as an external student at the University of London, and obtained a BA (first class) in Chinese in 1924, and then an MA (with distinction) in 1925. In 1931 she received a D. Lit. from the University of London, with a dissertation on \\"Prose literature of the T'ang period as contained in the T'ang Collection of Reprints\\" (i.e. the T√°ngd√†i c√≥ngsh≈´ Âîê‰ª£Âè¢Êõ∏). In March 1931 Edwards lost out in the competition for the position of Professor of Chinese at SOAS to Reginald Johnston, although two of the appointments committee voted for Edwards over Johnston. She was made Reader in Chinese instead. The relationship between Johnston and Edwards at SOAS was very poor, and he delegated most of the teaching and administrative duties to Edwards. In one argument with Edwards, Johnston confessed that \\"I don't profess to understand women and don't know how to deal with them\\". In October 1934 Johnston wrote to Charles Otto Blagden, then Dean of SOAS, stating that if the school was unable to support both a professor and a reader of Chinese then he would not object to his position not being renewed. This led to him receiving a notice of the termination of his position at the end of September 1935, but Johnston subsequently fought against this termination, and his position was renewed for a further two years. In 1935 Johnston took a leave of absence to visit the emperor Puyi in Manchuria, and while he was away Edwards was made acting head of department, and was paid Johnston's salary. In 1937, Johnston retired, and Edwards became acting head of the Far East department. Two years later, in 1939 she was appointed Professor of Chinese at SOAS. She remained head of the department until 1953, but was succeeded as professor by Walter Simon in 1947. In 1951 she became acting head of the Percival David Foundation of Chinese Art that was established by SOAS to house the collection of Chinese ceramics that Sir Percival David had donated to the school. Edwards retired from SOAS in 1955, and died unexpectedly two years later, on 29 September 1957. Contributions Edwards' main area of academic study was Tang dynasty literature and poetry, but she also cooperated with C. O. Blagden on studies of Chinese vocabularies of Malacca Malay (1931) and Cham (1939). She wrote a popular study of Confucius in 1940, and edited anthologies of translations under the titles Dragon Book (1938) and Bamboo, Lotus and Palm (1948). In addition to her academic studies, she played an important role in the administration of the Far East Department at SOAS, and organizing the running of Chinese, Japanese and Malay language courses during the Second World War. After the war, she helped plan the move of SOAS to its current location in Bloomsbury. Selected works * 1937‚Äì1938. Chinese Prose Literature of the T'ang Period. London. * 1938. The Dragon Book.

It was built from 1890 to 1899. It is also known as The Butchery Buildings. The property is owned by Property NSW, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002.  History  Evidence appears on the facades, and in early photographs of a post supported awning over the Cumberland Street shop front and two upper level verandahs on the Essex Street frontage. All these have since been removed. There is evidence on the eastern or end wall of these buildings of the terraced house(s) which were originally built to the Essex Street frontage but were demolished when Gloucester Lane was created before World War I. The image of these demolished buildings is equally visible on the western wall of 10-14 Essex Street. Archaeology notes: Granted to James Thompson and Robert FoppAR104 as Lot 13, Section 70 on 14 May 1836.  Description  This property comprises two, two storey, Victorian stuccoed brick terraced houses erected in the late 1880s. They are located in Cumberland Street between Essex Street and Cahill Expressway, with an extended side elevation to Essex Street. Each house has a basement area to take up the sloping nature of the site. No. 180 contained a ground floor corner shop. The two buildings are located hard against the Cumberland Street and Essex Street frontages resulting in relatively plain facades. They are designed in a restrained late Victorian style with rendered string course and cornice detailing. No. 178 has a triple rounded headed window to light the principal ground floor front room while the shop has a large display window facing Cumberland Street. The ground floor shop front appears to be in original form. No. 180 makes an interesting use of the side exposure to Essex Street by adding an additional setback, giving a small rear balcony to the upper front room. This is reflected below with a private entry to a cross stair giving access to the residence over which is quite separate from the shop.Schwager Brooks, 1989: 12-13 Internal Walls: Timber framed, finished with lath and plaster; Roof Cladding: Corrugated iron; Floor Frame: Timber; Roof Frame: Timber. They are among the later buildings of the group known as 158-180 Cumberland Street, which preserved almost intact a traditional 20th century Rocks streetscape. = Condition = As at 18 August 2000, each of the buildings is in derelict but structurally sound condition, although there is evidence of termite attack in timber floors and the beam carrying the facade over the shop front. Archaeology Assessment Condition: Partly disturbed. Investigation: Watching brief. = Modifications and dates = Both buildings appear to be in relatively original condition with few significant alterations. No. 178 Cumberland Street appears to have been used as a restaurant or coffee shop in the past. The wall between the two front rooms has been cut away and a series of false \\"timber\\" beams fixed to the ceiling. Timber battens were added to lath and plaster ceilings, possibly in the 1920s. An external toilet block was added in the rear yard but has since been demolished. No. 180 Cumberland Street appears to be in almost original condition, with regard to subsequent alterations.Schwager Brooks, 1989: 25  Heritage listing  As at 31 March 2011, this shop and residence and site are of State heritage significance for their historical and scientific cultural values.

Handheld weaving sticks use the same principle. A peg loom is a board, usually wooden, with one or more rows of holes, and a set of wooden or nylon pegs which fit into these holes. Each peg is a dowel with a hole drilled along its diameter near one end. Handheld weaving sticks are similar to the pegs, but tapered at the hole end and pointed at the other end. Plastic looms are also made for the educational market. Double-length warp threads are threaded through the hole in each peg or stick, and the loose ends knotted. The pegs are inserted into the loom, or the sticks are handheld, and the weft thread is woven around the pegs or sticks. As the work progresses, it is slid off the pegs or sticks onto the trailing warp threads. Different yarns can be used to create patterns, and when using sticks a curved piece of work can be created by weaving less often round certain sticks. Looms are made in a range of sizes. As an example, one English company makes looms from , with 9-63 holes. Most of their looms have three rows of holes, with 6mm pegs at spacings of 12.5mm and 9mm holes at spacings of 18.5 and 25.4mm. A larger scale peg loom has been used to create sleeping mats for homeless people from recycled plastic carrier bags. It has been said that stick weaving was used by people of the Great Lakes region of North America in the 1500s when French trappers first encountered them, and that in the 18th century it was taught to children to develop their manual dexterity before they entered the weaving trade.

He first worked in Suva, Fiji, for his architectural 'in practice' year in 1982 at 'Architects Pacific', a practice led by Stuart Huggett. On completing his architecture degree Davidson moved to London and worked as an architect and architectural illustrator, using the Macintosh and Harvard University's 'Schema' beta software as a core part of his illustration process. In 1989 Alan resigned his role as an architect and founded 'Hayes Davidson'. Based in London, Hayes Davidson' was the UK's first CGI-based architectural visualisation practice. He was an avid reader of Marvin Minsky and Jaron Lanier, and held a firm conviction that 3D modelling and rendering were not just an aid to artists, but more importantly were an inevitable and essential part of the base camp required to lead to a fully simulated re-creation of the world around us, as well as new worlds. In 1996, Alan designed and grew Hayes Davidson‚Äôs London studio, \\"from which it has developed an international client base of world- class designers and architects.\\" Alan collaborated with the 'Richard Rogers Partnership' (renamed RSHP in 2007) on major projects including Channel 4 and Terminal 5 at Heathrow. Other major architectural clients followed including Zaha Hadid, Norman Foster and Wilkinson Eyre. By 1995 HD had a team of 8 and was pioneering many different approaches to architectural CGI, including interactive illustrations, animations and touchscreen systems. HD won the CICA award for architectural illustration three years running.  21 Conduit Place  In 1997 Alan purchased and refurbished a warehouse building in Paddington, previously used by the musician Peter Gabriel, and, working with Toh Shimazaki Architects he created a purpose built studio for CGI-based architectural illustration. He was passionate about ongoing education for artists, and a dedicated facility in the building allowed for weekly seminars, which continue to this day. The team quickly grew to 25. The 5000 sq ft studio with its 10m high ceiling and 15m wide projector screen remains a grand and impressive space for clients, and for parties.  Hayes Davidson  The studio was commissioned to illustrate many well known and iconic London buildings before they were built or extended, including the London Eye, the Tate Modern, the Millennium Dome (now the O2), the Royal Academy, the Royal Festival Hall and the British Museum. The RIBA collected works by the studio in 2002 for the RIBA drawings collection; some of these images were exhibited in the Architectural galleries of the V&A.; Recognised as experts in the visualisation of architecture and the built environment, the studio gained a reputation for collaborating with many of the world's top architects and designers, including Kengo Kuma, Jean Nouvel and Thomas Heatherwick on projects located around the globe. Since 2000 the studio has continued to develop its CG based visualisation techniques and by 2015 had produced over 20,000 'virtual' or CGI images since it was founded. It celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2014. Alan was keen that the studio published its work; by the time of his death, 2 books had been published HD: Hayes Davidson and Hayes Davidson Book Two. In each book, he insisted on thanking all artists past and present as he believed it was collaborative effort which together had produced the work. He was passionate about London and studied the physiology and psychology of seeing the city, leading to him appearing as an expert witness at public enquiries of major London developments. He rejected what he felt was the pseudo-science of the official London guidelines for the placement of large or tall buildings, instead proposing a human-centric approach based on an understanding of how we actually see, and notice, built form. Alan led Hayes Davidson's move to employee ownership in 2015. He explained at the time \\"This change reinforces the truly collaborative nature of a professional architectural visualisation studio. Employee ownership reflects many of the important values already held at Hayes Davidson; of partnership, transparency and mutual support.\\" The Studio operates under a distributed management system. After his diagnosis, Alan started to take a back seat role. The studio celebrates its 30th year in 2019 making it the longest running Architectural Visualisation studio in the UK, and further afield.  Motor Neurone Disease  Alan was diagnosed with motor neuron disease in 2012. MND (Motor Neurone Disease), known as ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis) in the States, are a group of neurodegenerative disorders that selectively affect motor neurons, the cells which control voluntary muscles of the body. A person's lifetime risk of developing MND is 1 in 300, and it affects up to 5,000 adults in the UK at any one time. On average the disease kills a third of people within a year and more than half within 2 years of diagnosis.  The Alan Davidson Foundation  Alan established a charitable foundation in 2015 and committed the majority of his estate to good causes through the Foundation. The Alan Davidson Foundation supports many causes including MND research and care for those with disabling neurological conditions. By the time of his death, he had donated over ¬£1M to good causes.

It was built from 1868 to 1868. The property is owned by Property NSW, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002.  History  The subject site has been in continuous European usage since as it was part of the first hospital grounds. The hospital stood just to the south of the site and the residence and garden of the assistant surgeon covered part of the site. The hospital was relocated to Macquarie Street in 1816 when the Rum Hospital opened. The Assistant Surgeon's residence was occupied by Francis Greenway, the convict architect who had been transported for forging a building contract in 1814. Greenway was appointed civil architect by Governor Macquarie in 1816, part of his salary included lodgings. After Macquarie left the colony and Governor Brisbane took over, Greenway was retained as a government employee, but was dismissed in 1822. When the appointment ceased, Greenway refused to relinquish the residence, saying that Macquarie had promised to grant him the land and buildings. The Government tried every legal means to remove Greenway, but he finally produced a document which gave him title to the house. This document has since been suspected to be a forgery. Following the death of his wife, Mary, in 1832, Greenway sold portion of the property with the residence to Frederick Wright Unwin for . The right of The Crown to the land continued to be contested by the Government and Unwin settled the matter in 1835 by agreeing to pay the Crown for the title. Greenway remained in the house until he was forcibly evicted in July 1836. Unwin was finally confirmed with title to the land in 1838. In July 1839 Unwin leased the land to Michael Gannon on the express condition that he develop it, the lease agreement required that Gannon: A plan of Gannon's 1844 lease shows that by that time he had erected a number of buildings fronting George and Argyle Streets, including the New York Hotel at 91 George Street, his own business premises at 43-45 Argyle Street and three shops on the subject site. The rate assessments indicate the buildings were three storey shops with dwellings, brick or stone construction and of eight rooms. In the same year Gannon took out a mortgage with Joseph Samuel Hanson and was insolvent by 1847, forcing him to sell the leasehold to Hanson. Unwin, the holder of the freehold title was also in financial trouble and also declared insolvency in 1847. The title to the property was purchased by two investors, Robert Archibald Morehead and Mathew Young, in 1844 for . In 1861, for an unknown reason, the buildings at 95-99 George Street were vacated and the buildings demolished. The land remained vacant until when the present building was constructed, possibly to a pattern book design, by William Bradridge. Bradridge placed an add for tenders from bricklayers for three shops and dwellings in George Street North in The Sydney Morning Herald in February 1867 which may relate to the construction of the subject buildings. By 1868, Gannon's assignment of the lease to Hanson had expired and the subsequent lease arrangements have not been located. In 1870, Moorehead and Young sold the land to William Yeoman, a painter who already occupied the premises at 97 George Street. As a lengthy gap frequently occurred in the 19th century between effectively taking ownership of land and having the change of ownership registered with the Government, it is possible that Yeoman took over the land and caused the improvements to be carried out prior to officially having the land conveyed to him. The council rates of 1871 describe the new terrace of shops and dwellings as each of two storeys of five rooms of brick construction with an iron roof. They were occupied by 1868, with a butcher in No. 95 and a grocer in No. 99, these buildings continued to be used for those businesses for the next 20 years. Yeoman remained in No. 97 until 1873. In 1885 Yeoman sold the property to grazier John Gill of Moonbi for , an amount inflated by the financial boom of the time. Gill also acquired most of the land in the block bounded by George, Argyle and Harrington Streets and Suez Canal. Following the outbreak of the Bubonic plague in Sydney in 1900, the property, along with the rest of The Rocks and Millers Point was resumed by the Government. Following this resumption the Maritime Services Board administered the properties until ownership was taken over by the Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority. The shop at No. 95 was Thomas Claydon's butcher from 1868 until 1902, then Joseph Brigg's butchery until 1908. The cool room in the cellar from this early use of the building still remains. A clothier, initially Cohen Bros, then later Abraham Cliffe replaced the butchery and Cliffe continued to trade there until 1922. After this the shop became a grocer until the 1950s. Of the three shops No. 97 had the most varied occupation history, tenants including Yeoman, a painter, then a fishmonger, restaurant, hairdresser and bird dealer occupied the premises for almost 30 years until 1906. Between 1923 and 1931 the Empire Service Club had a reading room in No. 97. This club was formed by the ANZAC Fellowship of Women under Dr Mary Booth's leadership in 1923 as a welfare organisation for boys brought to Australia to train as farm labourers under the \\"Dreadnought scheme\\" between 1911 and 1939. 99 George Street was continually used as a grocers and run by a number of tenants until the 1970s. In 1970 control of the land was vested in the Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority (SCRA). The commercial use of the buildings has continued, however they no longer have a residential component. In the late 1970s and early 1980s the SCRA undertook restoration and reconstruction works on the terrace of shops. As at 2008, the shops were occupied by The Rocks Caf√©, the Sydney Cove Pharmacy and the Sydney Cove Newsagency.

Nos. 95-99 George Street are excellent examples of 1860s terrace shops and residences in the Victorian Italianate style, located within the main commercial precinct of The Rocks. The extant structures, constructed , retain a substantial degree of building fabric which demonstrates the architectural practice of the era, including timber framed glazed shop fronts and entrance doors. They are of historic significance as a site continuously used for retail and residential purposes since their construction in 1867. Nos. 95 and 97 contain highly intact shop interiors from the Victorian period, rare in NSW context. The near continuous occupation of No. 99 by grocers/fruiterers up to c.1980 is historically noteworthy. The buildings form an integral part of what was the major commercial centre of the colony, which has continued in the same use to the present day. As a group, the shops along the western side of George street have a landmark streetscape value, providing a strong architectural statement on the major entry into The Rocks. While differing in style, the buildings are sympathetic in materials and scale and form a unified visual precinct, and make a major contribution to the significance of The Rocks Conservation Area. The sites have strong associations with former uses and owners including the early penal hospital, the house inhabited by Francis Greenway, and stores erected c.1840 by local builder, Michael Gannon. The sites have archaeological potential to reveal evidence of the previous structures and uses of the site from the early days of the settlement. All have cellars, probably dating from the 1840s. This row of shops and residences are of State heritage significance for their historical and scientific cultural values. The site and buildings are also of State heritage significance for their contribution to The Rocks area which is of State Heritage significance in its own right. The site has scientific significance for the archaeological potential to reveal evidence of earlier buildings on the site including the Assistant Surgeons residence and the 1840s shop buildings. The cool room in the cellar of No. 95 is a rare industrial archaeological resource for understanding early means of refrigeration. Shops and Residences, Terrace was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The site of 95-99 George Street is historically significant as a site continuously occupied since 1788. The configuration of the building and Greenway Lane is historically significant is demonstrating the approach to urban planning prevalent in The Rocks . The original building at 95-99 George Street was constructed contemporaneously with the buildings at 45-47 Argyle Street and 91-93 George Street, imparting this group of buildings with a shared origin and history. The present boundaries or the site relate to the 1840s development. The current building at 95-99 George Street was constructed in 1867, and was one of the second generation of buildings to be built along George Street. It is an interesting reflection of the 19th century approach to town improvements in its quality of design and construction and the provision of shopkeepers' dwellings above individual shop fronts. 95 and 97 George Street are significant for their continual occupation and use as ordinary (non-tourist) shops, a type once dominant in The Rocks area. 95-99 George Street meets this criterion on a local level. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The site of 95-99 George Street is of significance for its association with the First Fleet, as the site of the house of the Assistant Surgeon from . The Assistant Surgeon's residence is also associated with the first colonial architect, Francis Greenway who lived in the house between 1815 and . The original building on the site, although demolished and rebuilt in 1867, is associated with Michael Gannon, a ticket of leave convict who made a living as a builder in The Rocks, developing a substantial parcel of land, including the subject site, from 1839. Gannon is an interesting example of the mid 19th century class of pardoned convicts who remained in NSW and practiced trades or professions The building is also associated with a number of former owners and occupants of note, including Fredric Wright Unwin, William Yeoman and long term resident Thomas Claydon. 95-99 George Street meets this criterion on a State level. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. 95-99 George Street is aesthetically significant as a find example of Victorian Italianate style, characterised by the moulded parapet and elaborate first floor window architraves and ground floor glazed timber shopfronts with recessed entrances. 95 and 97 George Street are aesthetically significant for containing some of the most intact Victorian period interiors for shops and residences in The Rocks area, including internal linings, joinery, some door and window furniture and an original plan form. 95-99 George Street makes an important contribution to the streetscape of George St, and is of significance in continuing the uniform character of the small scale retail shop buildings found in The Rocks. The building is aesthetically significant for its contribution to the streetscape of Greenway Lane, one of the pedestrian laneways in The Rocks area which are highly significant as evocation of the colonial townscape. 95-99 George Street meets this criterion on a State level. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The site is socially significant for its long history of continues occupation and residential use. Live-in shopkeepers are increasingly rare in The Rocks and this use is representative of what was once dominant in the social fabric of the area. 95-99 George Street is socially significant for its long history and for its contribution to The Rocks area, Australia's premier heritage precinct, as evidenced by its inclusion on a number of lists of buildings of heritage significance formulated by community groups such as the National Trust and representative bodies such as the City of Sydney Council and the Heritage Council of NSW. As part of The Rocks area, 95-99 George Street is likely to be held in some esteem by the individuals and groups who are interested in Sydney's history and heritage. 95-99 George Street, as part of The Rocks precinct, meets this criterion on a State level. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The site is technically significant for the archaeological potential to reveal evidence of earlier configurations of the hotel structures and road surfaces as well as the structure occupied by the First Fleet's Assistant Surgeon and later by Francis Greenway. The cool room, located in the basement of 95 George Street, built in 1867 for Thomas Claydon, the first lessee, is highly significant for it intactness. It demonstrates the early and long term use of the building as a butcher shop and has the potential to yield information regarding the history of refrigeration in Australia. 95-99 George Street meets this criterion on a State level. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. 95-99 George is an example of the large number of Victorian period retail shops in The Rocks with continued ordinary (i.e. non-tourist) retail and residential uses. 95-99 George Street is rare for the quantity of original fabric which is retained intact. Nos. 95 and 97 are among the most intact mid- Victorian shops in Sydney. The cool room in No. 95 George Street is rare as an intact example of 19th century refrigeration, built prior to the availability of mechanical means of cooling. 95-99 George Street meets this criterion on a State level. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. 95-99 George Street is a rare example of a Victorian Italianate style terrace of three retail shops in The Rocks of similar fabric, size and use (with residences above the shops). 95-99 George Street meets this criterion on a local level.

The home ground is located at Ocean Park Woonona and is the only rugby club in the northern suburbs of Wollongong. The club was formed in 1970 after the amalgamation of the two clubs Shamrocks RUFC and Woonona Surf RUFC. The team colours are green and white with the shamrock being the team's logo. Pre- amalgamation Shamrocks Rugby Union Football Club Shamrocks RUFC was founded in 1966 by the Corrimal YCW (Young Christian Workers who had originally been known as the Aurora club). In that year the Illawarra district Rugby Union extended an invitation to the Shamrocks to enter a team in the annual pre- season knock-out competition. The team strip consisted of a white guernsey with a huge red shamrock on the back, black shorts with red and white striped socks. Shamrocks won this knock-out and the IDRU subsequently invited them to play in the ‚ÄúC‚Äù Grade competition that year. Shamrocks went on to be 1966 Minor Premiers only to lose the Grand Final 3-0. They continued this success into 1967 - winning the Knock-out, minor premiership and the Grand Final to become premiers in only their second season. They retained the minor premiers tag in 1969, to make it three in a row, and though they missed out on a Grand Final that year they won promotion to B grade for the 1969 competition. Woonona Surf Rugby Union Football Club Woonona Surf RUFC was founded in 1968, arising from the camaraderie developed by surf club members involved in the renovations to Woonona Surf Club. The aim was to keep the summer team together during winter. The club strip was a maroon Guernsey with two yellow ‚ÄúVees‚Äù (similar to the Country Rugby League jumper), white shorts and maroon socks with yellow tops. They enjoyed early success, being Knock-out winners, and C Grade Premiers in 1968, beating Waratahs 16-6 in the Grand Final. In 1969, with both teams now in B Grade, Woonona Surf played Shamrocks in preliminary Final. Shamrocks scored five tries to four but lost 24-19, with a bloke called Rod Gilmour kicking the Surf Club to victory. Regrettably, the Woonona team lost the Grand Final to the Teachers College. The forming of the club Both teams had established a drinking base at Hoopers Royal Hotel Woonona with the publican Boyd Germyn becoming a strong supporter. A strong link developed between the two clubs with many members becoming mates by sharing each other's company in either the surf club during summer or the football clubs during winter. There was also a strong rivalry on the field. Given the success of both the fledgling northern clubs the IDRU made it known that they wanted a Northern Suburbs Club in their competition that could field three grades. Both clubs originally rejected the idea, but the seed had been sown, and eventually, under continued pressure from the IDRU, a meeting of members from both clubs was held at Woonona-Bulli Soccer and Sports Club in 1969. After much discussion, enough of the rivals agreed to the amalgamation, however, in a sign of things to come, the unified club ignored the IDRU's pressure to call themselves Northern Suburbs and decided that they would call themselves Woonona Shamrocks instead. Their home ground was to be at Nicolson park (In front of Woonona Surf Club). Unfortunately, the amalgamation did not initially result in the creation of a strong new club ‚Äì many players from both teams were against the unification and decided not to join the fledgling club. Fortunately to counter this loss, up to 15 ex-league players from St Paul's College Bellambi (more young Christians) decided to sign up. This was possibly due in part to the growing reputations for ‚Äúsocial interaction‚Äù, frivolity and camaraderie that were emanating from the Rugby base at ‚Äúthe Royal Hoopers‚Äù Woonona. Early Days The Woonona Shamrocks first playing strip was donated to the club by stalwart Jack Ryan and was a white jumper with a green saddle. The inaugural season was marked by the rare feat of running last in each of the three grades, with the only competition points coming from a drawn game in ‚ÄúC‚Äù Grade against Vikings. Each foundation player had the distinction of being presented with an engraved wooden spoon as a memento of their first season as a Shammie. The shortage of players helped instill an ethos ‚Äúto compete‚Äù, often traveling away with only 20 players or so to fill the three grades. Players doubled up, or even played on when injured, helping to develop an in-ground toughness and spirit that was to become a hallmark of the club. Hoopers Hotel remained the spiritual home after games, after training and after anything else, and this extra-curricular training enabled the club to build an enviable record in post-match ‚Äúboat-racing‚Äù ‚Äì a tradition that continues to this very day. Brown Muscat became a traditional drink of the club at halftime of each game and became known as ‚ÄúShamrock Champagne‚Äù. A yearly report from the early days of the club to the Illawarra Rugby Union Magazine 1978 The biggest year yet for the club. Ex-Wallaby Barry Stumbles entered the fold as player/coach, generating a new enthusiasm amongst the still loyal players. A dedicated approach to training and fitness, combined with a strong will to win, saw the Shamrocks came a close second in A Grade and minor premiers in both B and C grades. This resulted in the Shamrocks being a very close second in the Club Championship. All grades, therefore, played in the major semi-finals, with all three winning their way to the Grand Finals ‚Äì including victories over Vikings in A & B Grades. 1979 Shamrocks ‚ÄòA‚Äô Grade Premiers ‚Äìknocked off Vikings 4-0 in a very tight wet and blustery Grand Final. The Shamrocks came second in the Club Championship, finishing the preliminary rounds in 3rd place for ‚ÄòA‚Äô Grade, 2nd place for Seconds and 5th place for Thirds. The B Grade team went down to Vikings in their Grand Final for the second successive year. All this followed a tour to the US by 28 or so Shamrocks, playing nine games in California and Arizona including the San Diego Rugby Tournament. Winning more games than they lost, the Shamrocks introduced their hosts, the LA Unicorns, to the pleasure of Aussie style partying and the joys of playing with a hangover. The club farewelled inspirational coach Barry Stumbles, who returned to St George RUFC. Bruce Fergusson became the first ‚ÄòA‚Äô player to reach the 200 grade game milestone. After these two years, the club was seen as a competitive and a legitimate rival to verse within the Illawarra Rugby Competition. Current Era Today the Shamrocks as a club comprises a membership and supporter base of well over 600 people. The club fields teams in the Illawarra District Rugby Union Competition in NSW Australia. There are several junior sides from U/7's through to U/17's as well as three senior grade sides. The club is also a pathway to be selected in the Illawarra Rugby and NSW Country representative teams. The club celebrated their 50th anniversary in 2019. The club's website is https://www.shamrocksrugby.com.au/, providing details on how to join and game details. Club Song The three men behind the club song were, Keith ‚ÄúMickey‚Äù Roney, Keith ‚ÄúSluggo‚Äù Walker and Jack ‚ÄúTracker‚Äù Woods. Woods suggested a tune that was used by the 3rd Royal Australian Regiment (entitled ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre a pack of Bastards‚Äù). Reputedly, on the stools of the Royal Hoopers, with the help of the amber fluid, the words of this military ditty were rearranged to become the ‚ÄòA‚Äô verse of the anthem. The Shamrocks Hymn Book was compiled to help support the choir at post-match partying and associated club coach trips and tours. The tune used for the ‚ÄòA‚Äô verse came from the second part (aka ‚Äústrain‚Äù) of a popular American marching tune called ‚ÄúOur Director‚Äù penned by Frederick Ellsworth Bigelow (1873-1929). This tune is also shared by many American high school teams and other military units and organizations and is known as their ‚Äúfight‚Äù song. The second verse of the Shamrocks song was suggested by Mickey Roneys and is a different tune of the Toreador song from Georges Bizet's famous opera Carmen. Again, the need to ‚ÄòFight‚Äô is highlighted and has become an intrinsic part of the Shamrock RUFC ethos.

Founded in 1924 by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cambrai constituted in 580, it is now also contractually regulated by the Academy of Lille, a ramification of the French Ministry of National Education, Higher Education and Research. As of 2018, it welcomes within centuries-old ch√¢teauesque edifices around a thousand students from nearly a hundred municipalities within a radius extending twenty kilometers.  History  Fran√ßois de la Mothe-F√©nelon (6 August 1651 ‚Äì 7 January 1715) and the Duke of Burgundy290x290px Archangel Michael weighing souls, stained glass (1876/1916) Coutances Cathedral, France The Institution was first established on 13 May 1924 by Archbishop Jean-Arthur Chollet (21 November 1913 ‚Äì 2 December 1952) as a ramification of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cambrai itself erected in the late 6th century (Latin: Archdiocesis Cameracensis; French: Archidioc√®se de Cambrai) and placed under its aegis. It was formerly known as the Little Religious Seminary (French: Petit S√©minaire Saint-Michel de Solesmes). In the early Middle Ages, the Diocese of Cambrai (Lotharingia) was first ruled by West Frankish sovereign Charles the Bald in accordance with the implementation of the Treaty of Meerssen (870). Throughout History, it has been governed and regimented by such figures as the German king Henry the Fowler (925) or the Duke Gilbert of Lorraine (939). All immunities that had so far been granted to the Bishops of Cambrai were ratified by King Otto the Great (23 November 912 ‚Äì 7 May 973). In the early 1000s, this Bishopric was elevated to Imperial State by Emperor Henry II, to protectorate by Maximilian I of Habsburg in the late 15th century, was united to the Lower Rhenish‚ÄìWestphalian Circle in 1512 and integrated into the See of Mechlin in 1559 by Philip II of Spain. It was finally declared French under the Roi Soleil under the Treaty of Nijmegen (1678) following the Siege of Cambrai the preceding year. It was affiliated to the Nord through the Napoleonic Concordat of 1801. Among, the plethora of Diocese of Cambrai‚Äô most conspicuous individuals are found Charles the Good (1084‚Äì1127); poet and author Fran√ßois de la Mothe-F√©nelon (1651‚Äì1715); French Academy philosopher Gratry (1805‚Äì1872) and composer Guillaume Dufay (1397‚Äì1474). The Institution remained called the Little Religious Seminary up until 1965 when the boarding school opened its doors to external boys and subsequently to girls in 1968. The institution's eponymous Patron is Saint Michael known in the Old Testament as chief opponent of Satan and commander of the Army of God who is alone mentioned in the Litany of the Saints which omitted Saint Gabriel and Saint Raphael. = Celebrations = reaching to save souls in purgatory, by Jacopo Vignali, 17th century305x305px * The Russian Orthodox community established in Le Cateau-Cambresis was yearly invited to celebrate a mass of Byzantine Rite which differed with the Roman Rite in that they were two-hour-long services with songs in Russian without organ accompaniment, the consuming oscillating censers were held at the end of imposing chains and communion was under both species, bread and wine. * From the 1940s to the 1960s, on 24 December, students would be waking up to canticles and hymns through loud- speakers and would be treated to an ameliorated breakfast with brioche and hot chocolate. *Carols such as Stille Nacht, Heilige Nacht! or classics from German musicologist Michael Praetorius' (1571‚Äì1621) Syntagma Musicum (1614-1620) and Hymnodia Sionia (1611; Advent: 5. Alvus tumescit virginis & Christmas: 26. A solis ortus cardine; 27. Summo Parenti gloria), would be sang during the Midnight Mass. The Christmas Day was really a holiday. After the Low Mass and the Solemn Mass, students were gifted an improved meal with baptized wine. = Declamations = From the 1940s to the 1970s, students were alternately required to chant or read aloud from the official academic corpora unanimously agreed upon by the institution's on-site officiating abbots and priests. They were standing in front of a lectern in the small refectory and the dining hall on which books were placed following liturgical traditions. Being designated cantor or precentor was also used as punishment for misbehaving pupils. Main works were: * General Baron de Marbot's Memoirs (1891) by Jean-Baptiste Antoine Marcellin Marbot (18 August 1782 ‚Äì 16 November 1854). = Bombing of May 1944 = Each year, Saint-Michel‚Äôs students commemorate the Armistice of May 8, 1945 but also the bombing of Solesmes on May 9, 1944 which greatly impacted the institution. From February to June 1944, the Allies intensified their destructive efforts on roads and rails to isolate the Normandy landings and to dupe the Germans into believing that this landing would take place in the nearer Pas-de-Calais. General Eisenhower encapsulated those successful bombings \\"as the greatest contribution to the success of Overlord‚Äù (June 6, 44). On May 9, 1944; the 416th Bomb Group successfully destroyed the Aarschot railway station between Brussels and Antwerp with several Douglas Boston III Havocs each carrying four 250-kg bombs and the 409th Bomb Group caused death and destruction in Solesmes with the same equipment. On May 9, at around 8:15 am, the air alert loud sirens prompted all children who went to school to go back home and around 10:15, two explosions were heard as four bombs were accidentally detached from the freight deck of an aircraft and landed on the Chemin de Vertigneulof the Institution Saint-Michel causing the first victims. A fifth bomb will not explode and will be destroyed a few days later by the Germans, near Chant des Oiseaux. Seventy bombs exploded in the city-center killing fifty-eight people including twenty-two children and the destruction of ninety-seven buildings while the wounded were transferred to the hospital of Le Cateau. The town of Solesmes received the Croix de Guerre 1939‚Äì1945 (France). Historians revealed that it was the train station that was targeted with its ramifications to the sugar refinery and the electro-tubes. The American airmen had orders; when they were not carrying out their mission; to drop their bombs on secondary targets. Moreover, at 3500 m altitude the accuracy of a shot was 1 km but there was barely 500 meters between the station and the city-center.  International = Twinning Arrangements = The Institution Saint-Michel has long established exchange partnerships with education centers from across the Western world including with the: *: Patrick Henry High School in San Diego, California. *: Hampshire Regional High School in Westhampton, Massachusetts. *: Grammar School at Leeds (GSAL) in Leeds. *: Goethe-Gymnasium in D√ºsseldorf. *: 2nd High School of Miko≈Çaj Kopernik in Cieszyn (Poland). = Arts and Culture = * In their first years, Saint-Michel students go on 'Green Classes' which are educational retreats where students alternate classes and outdoor activities (horseback ri, ding, hiking, climbing,caving, canoeing, boating or fishing) for a period of few weeks. * Saint-Michel regularly hosts Canadian, American, Japanese and South-Korean young people as foreign language tutors in residence. * Many excursions are organized for exchange partner students such as to the Louvre and Library of the National Assembly in Paris, the Lace Museum in Caudry, the Commonwealth site of Le Quesnoy, Le Touquet-Paris-Plage, the Matisse Museum in Le Cateau-Cambr√©sis or the Museum of Fine Arts of Valenciennes. With regards to language and cultural fieldtrips, Saint-Michel students usually go to Leeds, Rome, Amsterdam, Edinburgh, London, Berlin and Florence. * Historical fieldtrips and educational getaways include the M√©morial de Caen war memorial in Normandy, the Douaumont Ossuary; the city of Verdun and its trenches; the Lewarde mining center; Juno, Omaha & Utah Beaches Museums; the Pegasus Bridge; the D-Day museum among many others. * For those undertaking the 'Theatre Studies Pathway', Pr.

On appeal, the Upper Tribunal determined that \\"many of the letters, which they referred to as 'advocacy correspondence', should be disclosed\\". Rather than appealing the decision of the Upper Tribunal, the Attorney General issued a certificate under section 53(2) of the Freedom of Information Act, effectively overriding the decision of the Upper Tribunal. Evans sought judicial review of the Attorney General's decision to issue the certificate in the High Court. A divisional court (Lord Judge LCJ, Davis LJ and Globe J) dismissed Evans' claim for judicial review. Evans successfully appealed to the Court of Appeal (Lord Dyson MR, Richards and Pitchford LJJ), which set aside the section 53(2) certificate. The Attorney General then appealed to the Supreme Court, which dismissed the appeal by 5‚Äì2 majority (Lord Wilson and Lord Hughes JJSC dissenting).

The main causes of the Romanian Army‚Äôs defeat by the numerically inferior German and Austro-Hungarian forces in the campaign of 1916 were the major political interferences in the act of military supervision, the incompetence, the imposture and the cowardice of a significant part of the military echelon of conduct, as well as the lack of an adequate training and troops‚Äô equipment for that specific type of war.  The offensive in Transylvania  The opposing forces at the beginning of the Romanian Campaign Romanian campaign in Transylvania, August 1916 In the night of 27 August 1916, three Romanian armies started the attack by crossing the Southern Carpathians and entering Transylvania. The first attacks were paved with success, forcing the Austro-Hungarians to retreat. While the Romanian army was advancing in Transylvania at 9 p.m., the Romanian ambassador in Vienna, count , presented Romania‚Äôs declaration of war at the secretariat of the Austria-Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. During that day, many Romanians with Austria-Hungarian citizenship were arrested in Bucharest. Among these were Ioan Slavici and Ioan BƒÉlan. By mid-September the Germans transferred four divisions on the front of Transylvania and stopped the Romanian advance. The Russians moved three divisions in order to help Romanians, but these troops were not equipped properly. General Esposito affirmed that the Romanian army leaders made some strategic and operational mistakes: > From a military point of view, the Romanian strategy had been the worst.

The northward attack was initiated by Bulgaria on 1 September. The attack was directed from the positions on the Danube to Constan»õa. Bulgarian troops, including the German- Bulgarian Detachment,Glenn E. Torrey,\\"The Battle of Turtucaia (Tutrakan) (2‚Äì6 September 1916): Romania's Grief, Bulgaria's Glory\\" surrounded and stormed the fortress of Turtucaia.

The plan, known as FlƒÉm√¢nda Offensive, consisted in an attack on the Central Powers forces through a flank and back shot, after the crossing of Danube at FlƒÉm√¢nda, while, on the main front line, the Romanian-Russian troops had to launch an offensive from Cobadin towards Kurtbunar. On 1 October, two Romanian divisions forced the course of the Danube at FlƒÉm√¢nda and created a large bridgehead of 14 kilometers and 4 kilometers in depth. On the same day, the Romanian-Russian division initiated an offensive on the frontline of Dobruja which recorded limited success. The failed attempt to break the German- Bulgarian front in Dobruja, combined with the violent storm during the night of October 1/October 2, which damaged the pontoon bridge over Danube, determined Averescu to cancel the whole operation. The consequences of this failure were big for the rest of the campaign. The counterattack of Central Powers, September‚ÄìOctober 1916  The defense of the passes  The command of the Austrian-Hungarian troops in Transylvania was assigned to Erich von Falkenhayn, who was fired from the position of Chief of General Staff after the failure at the Battle of Verdun, the opening of the Allied offensive on the Somme, the Brusilov Offensive and the entry of Romania into the war. He initiated his own offensive on 1 September. The first attack was directed against the Romanian 1st Army near the city of Ha»õeg. The attack stopped the advance of the Romanians. After eight days, two divisions of German mountain infantry almost managed to disperse the Romanian marching columns near Sibiu. The Romanian troops had to retreat towards the mountains, and the Germans managed to occupy Turnu Ro»ôu Pass. On 4 October, the Romanian 2nd Army attacked the German forces at Bra»ôov, but it was repulsed. The 4th Army that operated in the north of the country retreated when the 1st Austro-Hungarian Army exerted a moderate pressure on it. Therefore, by 25 October, the Romanian Army retreated to the initial lines before the offensive. Turnu Ro»ôu \\"Deutsches Alpenkorps 26.-29.9.1916\\" The forces under the command of Falkenhayn executed a certain number of attack tests in the passes of Carpathians in order to test the weak points of the defense. On 10 November, after a few weeks of concentration of their best troops, the elite unit Alpenkorps, Germans attacked in front of the Vulcan Pass, so that they pushed back the Romanian defenders into the mountains. On 26 November, fighting took to the hills. In the mountains, the snowfall started and soon the military operations stopped. The German 9th Army advanced in other sectors of the battle front, attacking all of the passes of the Southern Carpathians, Romanians being forced to retreat constantly, whenever their lines of supply became more and more stretched.  The retreat = The operations in Dobruja = On 1 September 1916, the Bulgarian 3rd Army passed the Bulgarian-Romanian border and advanced into Dobruja. The Russian General Andrei Mederdovici Zaioncikovski together with its troops arrived immediately in order to strengthen the allied Romanian-Russian front in an attempt to stop the army of Mackensen before it would conquer the Bucharest‚ÄìConstan»õa railway. Heavy fighting followed with intense attacks and counterattacks until 21 September. In Dobruja, General Mackensen launched a new offensive on 19 October. After a month of cautious preparations, the mixed troops under his command managed to defeat the Romanian and Russian troops. The Allies were forced to retreat from Constan»õa to the Danube Delta. The Russian Army was not only demoralized, but also left without supplies. Mackensen chose to transfer secretly half of his army near Svishtov, preparing to cross the Danube in force. = The defense of Bucharest = On 23 November, the best trained troops under the command of Mackensen crossed the Danube, leaving from two locations near Svishtov. The German attack took the Romanians by surprise, the front getting closer to Bucharest. The attack of Mackensen threatened to cut in two the Romanian front, and the new Chief of General Staff, the newly promoted General Constantin Prezan, tried to organize a desperate counterattack. The plan was very audacious since it used the entire reserve of the Romanian Army. Yet it needed the cooperation of the Russians for success in order to stop the offensive of Mackensen, while the Romanian Army would have had to attack exactly at the junction between Mackensen's and Falkenhayn's forces. The Russian Army did not agree with the plan and refused to cooperate. Operations in Romania, November 1916 ‚Äì January 1917 On 1 December, the Romanian army attacked anyway. Mackensen managed to transfer forces to Falkenhayn‚Äôs front of attack. After the containment of the Romanian offensive, Germans counterattacked at every point possible. = The stabilisation of the battlefront in Moldavia = The Government and the Romanian royal court retreated to Ia»ôi. On 6 December, Bucharest was occupied by the German cavalry. Only the bad weather and roads saved a good part of the Romanian Army from surrounding or destruction. Nevertheless, over 150,000 Romanian soldiers had been captured. Russians were forced to send massive re- enforcements on the Romanian front to avoid a German invasion into the south of Russia. After many low-intensity engagements, the German Army stopped their advance by mid January 1917. The Romanian Army continued to fight, although the most part of its territory was under foreign occupation. The losses of the Romanian army were estimated at 300‚Äì400,000 soldiers, dead, wounded, missing or prisoners. istorie-edu.ro The cumulated losses of the Germans, Austrians, Bulgarians, and Turks were estimated to approximately 60,000 individuals. The victorious campaign strengthened very much the morale of the German troops and its generals Falkenhayn and Mackensen. In many cases, the victories were attained by German divisions, with Bulgarian assistance in the south. Germans proved themselves superior at every chapter: supplying, equipment, training and the capacity of the leaders. Among the young officers from the elite troops Alpenkorps who fought on the Romanian front was the future Field Marshal Erwin Rommel.

The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. History Funeral in downtown Byron, 1900 In 1824, land speculator Samuel W. Dexter (who also founded Dexter, Michigan) founded the village of Byron. By 1828, the village was developing, and in 1836, Dexter sold his interest in the community to a group who formed the \\"Byron Mill Company,\\" which aimed to make the village a timber milling center by damming the river and erecting a sawmill. Settlement moved quickly, with the village's first frame residence built in 1837. In 1841 and 1842, the village gained a hotel and the first general store in what is now the downtown. Also in 1842, the mill changed hands; the new owners rebuilt is as a flour mill, reflecting the growing importance of agriculture. Over the next few decades, wheat and sheep grew in importance, and the village of Byron slowly grew to accommodate the surrounding farmers. Although never a regional center of trade and shipping, Byron did see increased business, including the manufacture of farming implements. Growth in Byron accelerated during the 1880s and 1890s as demand for goods increased, but the village still remained small as it was bypassed by the railroads. However, the bulk of the current downtown was constructed in the 1880s. in the 20th century, however, the rise of the automobile and the conglomeration of surrounding farms into large agricultural businesses has narrowed the commercial district's use. However, in the 1910s an elevator was constructed and the mill rebuilt as a feed mill. The section of the downtown in the commercial district retains many of the historic buildings from the 19th century, although a disastrous fire in 2012 destroyed a large block of them. Description The Byron Historic Commercial District consists of a two-and-one-half block long commercial district, covering the downtown area of the village. The district includes thirty-five buildings, of which twenty-two are one-and two-story commercial buildings, nine are houses, and the remaining structures include a mill, a factory, a dam, and a bridge. Of the thirty-five, twenty-six contribute to the historic character of the district, and include a selection of vernacular Greek Revival, Italianate, and early 20th century architectural style, constructed in wood and brick between 1840 and 1940. The district includes some of the first strictures built in Byron, such as the first frame residence in the village, built in 1837; the first store in the village, built , and an inn, constructed in 1848 to replace the inn built in 1842.

However, the nation would later reverse course, declaring neutrality for the first two years of the war before entering on the side of the Triple Entente in 1916.

The nature of these relations varied, being influenced by the evolution of the political, economic and security interests of Romania; the attitudes of the governments of Greece, Serbia, Turkey, and Bulgaria toward the country; and the relations of these countries with the two major alliances on the continent.(1989). Istoria militarƒÉ a poporului rom√¢n, vol.

The accomplishment of the latter would prevent the river from either being blocked as a result of local conflict, or being taken over by one of the Great Powers in the area. Based on these priorities, the external politics adopted by Romania in the first years of the 20th century was one of , with its main goal being the maintenance of the \\"balance of forces\\" in order to prevent the rise of a regional hegemonic state, which would preserve the status quo in the region.Keith, Hitchins (2013).

Alliances  On 18 October 1883, Romania secretly joined the Triple Alliance by signing a secret bilateral treaty with Austria- Hungary. The treaty stipulated that the allies would support each other in the case of an attack by another power (implicitly, Russia, Serbia, or Bulgaria), and would not join an alliance against the other. Germany joined the agreement on the same day, through a separate treaty.Ioan Calafeteanu, Cristian Popi»ôteanu (1986). Politica externƒÉ a Rom√¢niei. Dic»õionar cronologic, Editura »òtiin»õificƒÉ »ôi EnciclopedicƒÉ, Bucure»ôti The alliance with the Central Powers was the headstone of Romania's external politics for 30 years due to the king's and political leaders' perception that the Central Powers were the most powerful military and economic force in Europe.Mihai BƒÉrbulescu, Dennis Deletant, Keith Hitchins, »òerban Papacostea, Pompiliu Teodor (1998). Istoria Rom√¢niei, Editura EnciclopedicƒÉ, Bucure»ôti Through this alliance, Romania avoided the diplomatic isolation that would have resulted from an alliance between the Russian and Austro-Hungarian Empires. At the same time, Romania received specific guarantees of security, saw the consolidation of its political position in southeastern Europe, and obtained a convenient solution to the \\"Danube Question\\". Over time, however, the alliance between Romania and the Central Powers began to weaken, especially regarding the Romanian problem in Hungary. Romanian public opinion became more and more hostile toward Austria-Hungary. The Balkan Wars constituted the most severe test of the alliance between Romania and Austria-Hungary. In the Second Balkan War, Romania received no support from the Habsburg Empire, which had as a primary objective the assimilation of Bulgaria into the Triple Alliance. At the same time, a warming of relations between Romania and France came about after the latter supported Romania during the negotiation of the Treaty of Bucharest. \\"The Balkan crisis of 1912‚Äì1913 completed the alienation of Romania in relation to Austria-Hungary and the Triple Alliance.

It was designed by John Burcham Clamp and built during 1924 by Burcham Clamp and Finch. It is also known as Cadbury-Fry Building and Lawson Menzies Building. The property is owned by Property NSW, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002.  History  The site is known to have been occupied from the early years of the nineteenth century, although it was probably occupied in the first weeks after the arrival of the First Fleet. Lesueur's 1802 \\"Plan of the Town\\" shows the first St Philip's Church at the end of Gloucester Street and some buildings indicated in the vicinity of the subject site. The alignment of Gloucester and Cumberland Street was already established. The 1803-1807 field book of surveyor Charles Grime noted four owner/occupiers on two or three allotments on the site. James Meehan's 1807 \\"Plan of the Town of Sydney in NSW\\" indicates the site and nearby parcels of land were leasehold, at this time the site was still Crown Land. By 1822, the settlement of The Rocks was reasonably well established and plans show single allotments occupying the site, probably dwellings. Nine years later the Hodd, Lanner and Mitchell \\"Map of the Town of Sydney\\" provided street names and both Cumberland and Gloucester Streets terminating at Charlotte Place (now Grosvenor Street). Land at the subject site remained Crown Land until the 1830s and the Department of Lands titles information shows the site to be an amalgamation of various lots granted at this time as part of Section 64 including all of Lot 13 granted to William Davis in 1836, part of lot 15 to Thomas Bray and Edward McRoberts in 1839, part of lot 12 to Elizabeth Gaunson in 1840, part of lot 11 to James Glover in 1840 and part of lot 16 to Christopher Crane. The whole of lot 14 was granted to William Henry Dowling in 1841. The Sydney Council Rates books and the Sands Directory from the 1850s highlights the residential character of the site, there is little or no indication of industry on the site. There was some commercial use in the form of boarding houses and businesses operating from residences such as boot makers, dressmakers, jewellers and tailors. The dwellings were in private ownership until approximately 1907 when the land was acquired by the NSW Government in The Rocks Resumptions following the outbreak of the plague. The site was dominated by large brick and stone terraces characteristic of residential investment in The Rocks, there were some wooden buildings and smaller scale single storey dwellings on the site, but according to the rates books these were constructed earlier. By the 1870s the predominate construction medium was brick and majority of residences were at least two storeys. Some of these buildings remained on the site until the 1920s. The first Cadbury factory was built in Australia in 1922 in Tasmania following the company's successful English merger with Fry and Sons. Australia had been an important market for the company since the 1880s. Two years after the factory opened in Tasmania in 1921 application was made to construct a depot in Sydney. The Cumberland Street site was perfect because of its close proximity to the wharves, ensuring ease of delivery of products from Tasmania. The building opened as a warehouse and distribution centre in 1924, it was designed by the Sydney firm of Burcham Clamp and Finch. Cadbury Fry continued in the building until , during World War II they were the official suppliers of chocolate to the armed forces. In 1958 Craig Mostyn and Co moved into the building and also used it as a warehouse, packing and distribution centre. This company began in 1923 exporting leather, harvested wattle bark for the tanning industry and sold tanning machinery in Australia. Through the 1920s & 30s they expanded into other Australian products including eucalyptus oil, wool, rabbit skins and tallow. The company gradually expanded acquiring mills, exporting fruit and by 1960 were a large exporter of bark. The building was occupied by the auctioneer company, Lawson's in 1982. Lawson's had been a well known auctioneer since 1870 when James R. Lawson established himself as a leading Sydney auctioneer, at that time everything from groceries to sailing ships were auctioned. In September 2001 the Menzies Group of Companies acquired Lawson's and the company expanded into two brands with the Cumberland Street office known as Lawson-Menzies. This company targeted the upper end of the Australian auction market for art, wine, jewels, decorative art and prestigious house contents.  Description  The building is a robust dark brick building with sandstone trim, including strong parapet feature. It has three levels to Cumberland Street, and four levels to Gloucester Street. The building, commenced in 1924, is of the Inter-War period in the Free Classical style, displaying the characteristic classical elements introduced into an otherwise simple exterior. Classical features include large dentilled cornice to sandstone parapet (with protective lead capping), articulated brick pilasters (with decorative 'quoins'). The steel framed windows are typically small and operate by pivot. Where window is multi-paned, the central windows pivots, and the top and bottom sashes are fixed. The entrance foyer appears to be in original condition, with marble floors, threshold and wall lining, and original timber doors. Inner entry doors are timber with bevelled glass panels. A plaque in the entry foyer refers to Lawson's occupation of the building in 1982, as opened by the NSW Governor, Air Marshal Sir James Rowland, for JR Lawson Pty Ltd. Internally, the southern end retains a significant degree of original fabric, and layout, including timber panelling, timber joinery (doors, architraves, skirting boards, glazed partitions, staircase). The northern end, is largely divided by modern partition walls. The ceiling is modern - suspended acoustic. = Condition = As at 27 April 2001, Archaeology Assessment Condition: Mostly disturbed.

Heritage listing  As at 30 March 2011, Lawson House and site are of State heritage significance for their historical and scientific cultural values. The site and building are also of State heritage significance for their contribution to The Rocks area which is of State Heritage significance in its own right. Lawson's is significant as a robust Inter-War Free Classical style warehouse building, remaining in commercial operation. It has a high degree of integrity, retaining much of its original layout and features internally and externally. Original/early aspects of the building include the brick and stone elevations, steel framed windows, marble finishes, timber joinery and overall layout, and are of historic and aesthetic significance. The form of the building responds sympathetically to the curve of Cumberland Street. Lawson House was constructed as the Sydney Depot for the Cadbury-Fry confectionery company and designed in the Inter War Free Classical style by architects Burcham Clamp and Finch. Historically, the building is evident of the Inter War period of development that occurred in The Rocks. It is significant for the contribution the building makes to the historical and scientific values of The Rocks. It also forms a small precinct of Interwar commercial buildings which replaced Victorian period housing that was intended to be resumed prior to the First World War. Historically, the building is associated with well known confectionery company Cadbury-Fry Pascal Pty Ltd although the use was relatively short lived, it was not a flagship building of the company and the ability to interpret this association has been eroded as the use has ceased and machinery removed. Lawson House is also associated with the well known Sydney architectural firm Burcham Clamp and Finch. Stylistically and structurally it is similar to the other buildings designed by John Burcham Clamp but owing to its construction date it does not demonstrate the progressive techniques of style and construction that are evident in a number of his other buildings. Lawson House is aesthetically and technically representative of restrained example the Inter War Free Classical style of architecture featuring a robust form, prominent end bays, dressed stone detailing, timber partitions and other early finishes to office and office foyer spaces. The building structure is relatively common for the period and typical for buildings used as commercial warehouses. The site demonstrates some research potential for relics related to the former residential use of the site from the mid nineteenth century. Lawson House was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Constructed in , Lawson House is historically representative of the Inter War phase of commercial redevelopment in the state significant precinct of The Rocks. The site was originally planned for resumption in the early part of the twentieth century, however this was interrupted by the First World War (1914‚Äì18) and redevelopment of the site and some surrounding properties did not occur until the 1920s. Consequently, the building stock in this area consists largely of commercial buildings which contrasts to the terrace housing and flat buildings constructed during the Federation period of resumptions. Lawson House is one in a group of four Inter-War commercial buildings in the block bounded by Grosvenor, Gloucester, Essex and Cumberland Streets. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The building was originally constructed for use as a factory and warehouse for the well known company Cadbury Fry who have produced confectionary in Australia since the 1920s. The subject building was not the flagship but the Sydney Depot and a centre to facilitate trade. The change in the use of the building after more than 30 years of occupation and the removal of machinery has hindered the ability to interpret the use by Cadbury-Fry. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Lawson House is a largely intact example of an Inter-War Free Classical warehouse building. It is considered to be an aesthetically representative example of an Inter War Free Classical commercial building. The building makes a strong contribution to the streetscape and the urban morphology of The Rocks.

It was built from 1807. It is also known as Suffolk Lane; Stubbs Lane; Gloucester Lane; and Cribb's Lane. The property is owned by Property NSW, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002. The top steps lead to Cumberland Street. A set of steps at the lower end of the place leads to Harrington Street. Cumberland Place gives access to the rear of Susannah Place, a heritage-listed building, formerly cottages and a store and now a museum.  History  The 1994 archaeological investigation on the Cumberland and Gloucester Streets site confirmed that Cribbs Lane was in existence, between Cumberland and Gloucester Streets, by at least 1811. However the laneway may have existed earlier as early maps and plans show a footpath or track between Cambridge and Cumberland Streets on the alignment of Cumberland Place by 1807, and the convict butcher, George Cribb, purchased a house in 1809 that lay along the alignment of the laneway. Cribb set about purchasing properties around this house, and all this land was on the southern side of the laneway alignment. By 1811 he owned almost half of the land on the area today included in the Cumberland and Gloucester Streets archaeological site, including along Gloucester Street. Cumberland Place between Cambridge and Gloucester Street is on the same alignment as Cribbs Lane between Gloucester and Cumberland Streets, so this could indicate that Cribbs lane extended from Cumberland Street to Harrington Street. The section between Cambridge Street and Cumberland Street was called Cribb's Lane by 1823 Harper's Plan of Sydney 1823 shows Cribbs Lane labelled as 'Stubb's Lane', with name crossed out. Between Harrington Street and Cambridge Street the thoroughfare is not shown but there is a clear area in the exact location of the lane, between building lines. Inspection of a copy of the original shows that a laneway may have been drawn in this location, but it wasn't labelled and is very faint. It appears that in 1973 the overlay map made use of knowledge of the area and filled in the blanks. By 1825, similar through lanes (e.g. Longs Lane), were well established, and their names recorded on contemporary maps. Gloucester Street itself did not have a regular alignment. One of the boundaries to Cumberland Place at the eastern side of Gloucester Street is Susannah Place, a row of four terrace houses (one serving as shop), constructed in 1844. Harpers map of 1823 indicates structures here by that date facing Cambridge Street and this could be interpreted to mean that the boundary of Cumberland Place was already set by the time Harper's map was surveyed in the early 1820s. A public house was in operation on this site from c.1824. A building application dated 20 October 1830 for a two-storey stone building included a provision for Cribbs Lane to remain. The first original depiction of a thoroughfare between Harrington and Gloucester Streets in the location of Cumberland Place appears in the 1832 NSW General Post Office (GPO) Directory. An 1838 plan of Sydney is the earliest known official plan that shows the name of the \\"Cribbs Lane\\" between Cumberland and Gloucester Streets. In the 1840s, the gaol moved from its site on George Street to Darlinghurst, and the original gaol building was demolished. A plan was drawn up to show the land of the gaol and the \\"Proposed Realignment of Harrington Street\\". The plan shows a \\"Proposed Lane\\" where Cumberland Place is now. This laneway was already in existence by that date, so this plan could be the instrument used to formalise the thoroughfare. Similarly, Globe Street, which was also depicted in some earlier maps and plans, is here marked as a \\"Proposed Street\\", indicating that in 1848 it had not been officially recognised. The expansion of Sydney suburbs to the east, south and west made the city too large to be depicted with much detail on most maps produced after the 1840s. Small laneways and alleys were seldom shown as the scale of maps increased. One of the maps that shows The Rocks at a good level of detail is the 1865 Trigonometrical Survey of Sydney. This map shows and labels Cribbs Lane running from Harrington Street to Cumberland Street. Interestingly, there are no stairs marked on the alignment of the laneway, but the stairs at the retaining wall in the centre of Harrington Street are shown. This may indicate that the stairs that are today an important feature of Cumberland Place had not been built before 1865. The name of the thoroughfare was changed between 1890 and 1900. Since the early 1800s the entire laneway from Harrington to Cumberland Street was known as Cribbs Lane. In 1896 the Sydney City Council received petitions to change that name to Cumberland Place. Since all plans and historic images from that date refer to the lane as Cumberland Place, it is assumed that the suggestion was acted upon. The name Cumberland Place held much more prestige than Cribbs Lane. The Council at the time was changing names around the city primarily to try to cut down on duplication of names, but anyone could request a name change for any reason, and all the Council had to do was to gazette it. The date of creation of the earliest steps in Cumberland Place cannot be confirmed. They were apparently built some time before 1887, as the earliest documents to show the steps on Cumberland Place are the City of Sydney Sections, drawn in that year. The road levels in Harrington Street were changed in 1907 to their current level. Previously, they were on two levels. This may have affected the steps into the laneway from Harrington Street. An etching by Lionel Lindsay, dated , shows a narrower flight of steps from Harrington Street than exists today. The etching provides evidence from the stone retaining walls on Harrington Street that the steps were widened to the north. They were widened to twice their original width during the 1970s. Due to wear, the older side of the Harrington Street Steps were fenced off and the other side capped with concrete in the 1990s. When Cumberland Street was realigned and widened in 1911, the streetscape of Gloucester Street changed significantly, as a number of buildings were demolished including the notable Gloucester Street Bridge. As two sections of Gloucester Street were divided, and its level in the vicinity of the subject site was raised, a retaining wall was constructed in front of the Gloucester Street terraces (including Susannah Place) to support the newly elevated grounds of the street. About that time, the fourth set of stairs was added to Cumberland Place.  Description  Cumberland Place and Steps is a public thoroughfare from Harrington to Cumberland Street, comprising a laneway with a series of flights of steps and landings. Half of the first flight of steps from Harrington Street between Nos. 55 and 57 has been fenced off from public use by an iron railing for safety reasons as the stone is very worn and uneven. These are the steps depicted in an etching by Lionel Lindsay , which are narrower than the steps as they are today. The steps have been widened to the north and are continuous with the stone steps but have been given a concrete surface over stone. There is a landing which opens up to an area shaded a tree then concrete aggregate steps continue up to the Cambridge Street level, where there is an early lamp post (s). The pedestrian way continues up to Cumberland Street via two further flights of stairs with a landing leading to Cumberland Street, between No. 64 (Susannah Place) and Baker's Terrace, Nos. 66-72 Cumberland Street. There is a bitumen block edging to the ramp on the northern side of the first flight of steps from Cambridge Street, which dated from . There are other such blocks found only at the Victoria Barracks, the East Sydney Technical College, the Lands Department central courtyard and at Garryowen, Rozelle Hospital.McBeath, D., 2000 Across the road, Cribbs Lane, which is on the same alignment was uncovered during the 1994 excavation of the Cumberland/Gloucester Street dig site, it is assumed from the evidence that this laneway is associated with Cumberland Place and once extended from Cumberland Street through to Harrington Street. The Cribbs Lane section was planned to reopen to the public near the end of 2009. = Condition = As at 13 May 2004, the condition of the site is fair. The worn steps have been fenced off to prevent the public using them for safety reasons. A concrete layer has been installed over the original stone for safety and conservation reasons. The Cribbs Lane section, between Gloucester and Cumberland Street is flagged with sandstone and was covered by bitumen. This section is an archaeological item. The Cumberland Place section between Gloucester and Harrington Street is likely to contain an important archaeological resource. Archaeology undisturbed  Heritage listing  As at 27 January 2009, Cumberland Place is of heritage significance for the State of NSW for historical and scientific reasons. It is of significance for The Rocks and Sydney areas and for the Foreshore Authority for its elements that are rare or representative on the local level. Cumberland Place is a related place to a number of State heritage items located in the adjacent Harrington, Cambridge, Cumberland and Gloucester Streets. Cumberland Place is of historical significance as one of the oldest known pedestrian streets in The Rocks, and probably Australia, being continuously in use since at least 1808. It is significant for the local area and Sydney in demonstrating the early urban character and scale of development that characterised The Rocks throughout the 19th Century, particularly as part of the Cribbs Lane. Its physical form demonstrates the urban planning response of the early days of the European settlement to the local rocky topography. There is a high likelihood of encountering archaeological relics on the site, and these relics may be of State level of significance. Cumberland Place includes elements of planned urban facilities, including stars, stair risers and retaining walls as elements that are rare or representative in the local context. This includes historical stone risers, worn of long use, which are elements of archaeological interest. Cumberland Place and Steps was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Cumberland Place is historically significant as a pedestrian path that continuously connects the higher areas of The Rocks to the Sydney Cove since at least 1808. The current configuration is historically significant in demonstrating that path, and as the southern part of Cribbs Lane that was defined in The Rocks from the 1840s. The present configuration (and some elements of fabric) relate to that early configuration, with several buildings that defined Cumberland Place surviving, including Susannah Place (c. 1849) and Baker's Terrace (parts from the 1860s) on Gloucester Street. The surviving Cumberland Place fabric is important in demonstrating the pedestrian character and modest scale of the narrow lanes that characterised The Rocks in the 19th Century. The creation of Cumberland Place as a series of ramps, stairs and concourses demonstrates the urban planning response of the early days colony to the rocky topography. Cumberland Place meets this criterion on State level. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. Cumberland Place has evolved over a considerable period of time through subsequent improvements of the pathway that would originally have been selected by pedestrians due to its favourable natural terrain configuration. However, there is no strong or special association with any particular person of importance in the course of history. Cumberland Place does not meet this criterion. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The extant fabric of Cumberland Place is an example of public stairs and passageways of the 19th and 20th Centuries in Sydney, however, it does not appear to possess any rare or unusual features that could be described as important in terms of aesthetics, or of creative or technical achievement. Cumberland Place does not meet this criterion. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Cumberland Place is of interest for heritage professionals and general public for its important part in the history of The Rocks. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. It is estimated that archaeological relics of State significance may survive under the protective layers of concrete and asphalt, including below Stairs B, C and D and the associated concourses. Important elements of early fabric are also likely to survive within the three of the four stairs, and the significance of these elements is likely to be of local level. Cumberland Place meets this criterion on State level. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Cumberland Place is rare in The Rocks and Sydney context as a remnant of a pedestrian urban communication path, indicative of the scale and character of early Sydney. The surviving fabric includes original and early stone risers, bricks, and retaining walls as elements that are rare in The Rocks and Sydney terms. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Cumberland Place is important in demonstrating the character of an early urban environment of Sydney. In its current form, its elements are identifiable as examples of Sydney's urban facilities of the 19th and 20th century and are representative of government's approach to the urban design and planning in the various periods.

The architecture of the memorial was composed by architect E.D. Nimgade. Later, On 14 April 2008, the 117th birthday of Ambedkar, inaugurated the memorial. Nearly 4.52 acres of land is connected to the memorial. Every year, millions of Ambedkar's followers, Buddhists and other tourists visit this place, especially on 14 April and celebrated Ambedkar's birthday with pomp and gaiety. Mhow is 216 km away from Bhopal and 20 km away from Indore. In this place, the Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi had visited the 125th Ambedkar Jayanti in 2016 to pay tribute to Babasaheb. In 2018, the 127th Ambedkar Jayanti, the President of India Ram Nath Kovind tributed Babasaheb by visiting Mhow. This memorial is one of the Panchteerth, five holy sites related to the life of Babasaheb Ambedkar. The Madhya Pradesh government organizes 'Samajik Samrasta Sammelan' every year at Ambedkar Jayanti in Mhow. Apart from this, various social and cultural programs are organised here. History The memorial is dedicated to B. R. Ambedkar. Ambedkar's father Ramji Maloji Sakpal completed his education at the Pantoji School in Pune and started his career as a teacher in the British army of India. He rose to prominence as the Prime Teacher and later as the headmaster. After 14 years of headmaster's work, the post of Subedar-major in the army got elevated to Mhow. Mhow was the Military Headquarters of War. Ambedkar was born on 14 April 1891, in the Kali Paltan area of Mhow, on the sack of Bhimabai and Ramji Sakpal. Ambedkar's birth name were Bhim, Bhiva and Bhimrao. Due to the abolition of untouchability, the formation of Indian constitution and Buddhism revival and other activities, the Babasaheb Ambedkar has to be considered as a notable person on the world stage. The birthplace of Babasaheb Ambedkar, who fought for the rights of the downtrodden, became a holy land and important place. On 27 March 1991, Buddhist monk Sanghshil, the founder president of the \\"Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Memorial Committee\\" organized a meeting of the committee. It was decided that Madhya Pradesh's Chief Minister Sunder Lal Patwa will be invited to foundation stone of the memorial. On the birthplace, memorial building design were created by architect ED Nimgade. Preparations for the celebration of the birthday festival were started. Bhanteji a (Buddhist monk) went to Mumbai to fetch the urn of Ambedkar's ashes and he returned to Mhow with the Urn of ashes on 12 April 1991. The foundation stone of the memorial was laid by the Chief Minister Sunder Lal Patwa on 14 April 1991, the 100th birth anniversary of Ambedkar. Atal Bihari Vajpayee and minister, Bherulal Patidar and Bhante Dharmashil were present this association. Later, the grand Bhim Janmabhoomi monument was built and the memorial inaugurated on 14 April 2008, 117th birth anniversary of Ambedkar.

It was built during 1890 by William John Finneran. The property is owned by Property NSW, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002.  History  In the area of study the houses on allotment 7, Nos. 169-171 Gloucester Street, were demolished between 1880 and 1882 and the land was still vacant when it was consolidated in a single title with the adjoining land in Cumberland Street in 1898. On the Cumberland Street frontage the houses on allotments 4 & 5, Nos. 184 & 186 Cumberland Street were demolished in 1889. By 1891 all of the area was owned by Herbert Salway. With a trend for the construction of large commercial premises in the area it is possible that Salway hoped to build on a large scale but any such plans were delayed by the depression of the 1890s. By 1898 the whole area was sold to James Channon. A month later Channon subdivided the land and sold that part of it to William John Finnegan, a builder of Rouse Hill. Four new houses had been built on the Cumberland Street frontage by 1900 and two on the Gloucester Street frontage by -1902. It is most likely that Finnegan was the builder of all of these dwellings. Rate assessment books and entries in the Sands Directories suggest that the Cumberland Street terraces were completed and occupied by 1900. The terraces continued to be used as residences to the late 1970s, despite the building of the southern approach to the bridge and the gradual change of buildings in this area to a commercial use.Cserhalmi 1992: 5-27,62 The buildings then were derelict for a number of years and prior to their restoration were occupied by squatters. Work on the terraces to restore them to residential use for leasehold was completed in 1996.SCRA Annual Reports 1995: 24 and 1996:25 Archaeological History - Partially covered by grants (all Section 64): Lot 4 to William LongAM070-071; AM075-083; AM151; AR097; AR144 of 22 June 1839; Lot 5 to William DavisAM015-016; AM020-023; AR068-070; AR111-112; AR143 of 14 May 1836; Lot 6 Government Land claimed by T. Galbraith; Lot 7 claimed by Thomas Hancy. The Conservation Plan for the site revealed it had been occupied by two dwellings since at least the 1820s, the current terraces being constructed in 1898. Elements from an earlier structure (s) were identified in the foundations and first floor wall of the terrace.  Description  The terraces are typical examples of Victorian Terrace Houses built as an investment. The planning of the four terraces is similar with the basement containing the laundry and an external toilet; the ground floor containing the parlour, dining room and kitchen; the upper floor containing one large bedroom and two smaller bedrooms and a bathroom. Typical elevational details include some fine cast iron balustrade panels (largely intact), evidence of a cast iron frieze and brackets to the upper balcony beam and surviving examples of the cast iron fringe, brackets and frieze drop fixed below the balcony floor beam. Internally, the main rooms have or show evidence of moulded timber surrounds to fireplaces, four-panelled timber doors, decorative ceiling roses but no cornices. Style: Victorian Terrace Houses; Facade: Painted brickwork; Ceilings: Original lath & plaster. Terraced houses including vacant lot.; Built By: 1820s = Condition = As at 27 April 2001, Archaeological Assessment Condition: Partly disturbed. Assessment Basis: A decision had been made with this site that ground disturbance would be minimal and limited to areas already disturbed by services. During conservation works however, part of the rear wall of the terraces collapsed due to an inadequate foundation, requiring urgent underpinning along the length of this wall. Subsequent excavation indicated that the two-storey rear wing was founded on demolition material from the earlier structure, which in some places was up to one metre in depth indicating that the site has a very high archaeological potential. Investigation: Watching Brief Archaeology partly disturbed. = Modifications and dates = *1995-96: The terrace was restored. = Further information = The conservation policies should be modified in the light of the conservation work undertaken in 1995-96.  Heritage listing  As at 1 April 2011, this terrace and site are of State heritage significance for their historical and scientific cultural values. The site and building are also of State heritage significance for their contribution to The Rocks area which is of State Heritage significance in its own right. The terraces have streetscape significance and provide a humanising aspect to this area of The Rocks. The historic significance of the terraces is reasonable, particularly due to their survival through the 1900s and the 1920s. These terraces are amongst the last examples of speculative housing to be constructed in this area. The architectural significance of the terraces is not particularly unique, but nonetheless they are a representative example of a building form common throughout Sydney. Few examples of terraces of this type remain in this area, and they provide a valuable record of the variety of nineteenth century housing forms once common in the Rocks and Millers Point. The site is significant as an archaeological resource (both above and below ground) spanning 180 years of residential use.Cserhalmi 1992: 66 Terraces was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The site is situated within one of the earliest areas of settlement in Australia. The terraces reflect the original mainly residential use of this area from at least 1802 until the present. The early stone remnants incorporated in the present buildings have considerable historic significance, dating from the 1820s or earlier, and if so, may be amongst the earliest remnants of buildings in The Rocks. The site and its associated buildings were unaffected by the clearance activities initiated by the outbreak of bubonic plague due to their recent construction at that time. In the 1920s the site and its buildings again survived a major construction project in the area, namely the building of the Harbour Bridge, and stand in dramatic contrast to the ambition and style of the 1920s-1930s as shown in the bridge and its approaches. The Cumberland Street allotments have a minor associational significance with William Davis and William Long and although not occupied by them, reflect the vigorous early 19th century economic life in The Rocks. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The terraces are now an isolated example of the original residential nature of this quarter of The Rocks. The terraces display excellent cast iron and decorative plaster elements to the street frontage. The terraces contain examples of good late 19th century craftsmanship, in particular the joinery elements. The terrace No. 186 contains an early intact kitchen fireplace and cast iron hob. The restored terraces will reinforce The Rocks character of this area and provide a humanising aspect to the streetscape. The retention of these characteristic low scale traditional terraces will promote the increased residential and tourism uses of this area.Cserhalmi 1992: 67-68 The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The site has considerably rarity value being situated in one of the earliest areas of European settlement in Australia. The site has evidence of permanent residential usage from c.1802 to the present day and has the potential to demonstrate the way of life in a residential area of Sydney over almost two centuries. The site provides and accessible resource for archaeological investigation and historical, social and architectural interpretation, public access and education.Cserhalmi 1992: 67  See also  *Australian residential architectural styles  References = Bibliography =  = Attribution = External links  * New South Wales State Heritage Register The Rocks, New South Wales Terraced houses in Sydney Articles incorporating text from the New South Wales State Heritage Register 1890 establishments in Australia Houses completed in 1890 ","title":"182.5-188 Cumberland Street, The Rocks"},{"id":"59066478","text":"\\"Wow Thing\\" is a song by South Korean project girl group Station Young.

It was designed by Walter Liberty Vernon with the assistance of E. L. Drew and built from 1911 to 1912. The property is owned by Property NSW, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002.  History  Early maps of the area show a rectangular building located at the corner of Cumberland and Essex Streets as early as 1832. Rate books for the Council of the City of Sydney list a two-roomed, stone building with a shingled roof. The building was described as a house in rate books in 1852 but in 1853 was described as a shop with a \\"bake house at the back\\". The land was transferred to the Surveyor- General on 9 May 1834 and granted on 30 June 1834 to Aaron Byrne and Joseph Moss. On 13 February 1852 the property was sold to Samuel Watson, a grocer of Sydney. At some time after the resumption of the property in 1902 by the NSW Government and prior to the construction of the present building in 1911/1912 the existing stone shop and house was demolished. This most likely occurred just prior to the construction of the present building as confectioner, Anders P Johnson is listed as the occupant of the building in 1907 and also from 1913 to 1918. The existing shop and dwelling at 182 Cumberland Street was designed in 1911 and possibly being completed in 1912. The original working drawings of the proposed scheme located in the Archives Office of NSW were signed by W. L. Vernon, Government Architect on 2 March 1911 and by E. L. Drew, Assistant Architect on 3 March 1911.Robertson & Hindmarsh 1994: 5-12. The building remained little changed until 1966, when some changes were proposed by the then owner, the Maritime Services Board. Prior to the conservation works undertaken in 1995-96, the building became derelict and was boarded up for some time. The building is now used as a shop and residence. Archaeology Notes: granted as Lot 1, Section 64 to Aaron Byrne and Joseph Moss, executors of the will of Elizabeth Moss, 6 September 1834.  Description  The two storey building at the corner of Cumberland and Essex Streets has brick parapet walls, with a slate roof behind. The part of the building on the corner is grander, with stepped sandstone lintels above the shop entry and windows and sandstone keystones above the first floor arched windows. The lower part of the building facing Essex Street features an arched brick entry doorway and does not have a parapet.

Assessment Basis: Terraced into hill slope. = Modifications and dates = *26 January 1967The Council of the City of Sydney approved alterations to the building. The drawings were prepared by architect G. Rae clearly show that the building had remained substantially intact from 1912 until 1966. In G. Rae's alterations to the ground floor the original recessed corner entry was removed and replaced with a plate glass window, the walls around the store room behind the shop were demolished, the stairs down to the Essex Street level were demolished. On the first floor the brick walls around the south bedroom were removed.Robertson & Hindmarsh 1994: 18 *1995-96Conservation works were undertaken on the building, to restore its former use as a shop and residence.SCRA Annual Report 1996:25  Heritage listing  As at 26 June 2002, this shop and residence and site are of State heritage significance for their historical and scientific cultural values.

Puszkarz spent the majority of his career playing for football teams in the Tricity area, spending the majority of his career playing for Lechia Gda≈Ñsk. Puszkarz received one cap for Poland, playing against East Germany on 28 May 1975.  Early years  Puszkarz first became interested in football due to his father, Tadeusz Puszkarz, who was known as a huge fan of Lechia Gda≈Ñsk. This interest grew stronger when Zdzis≈Çaw himself started to become interested in Lechia, and was quickly a fan often watching the team at Mosir Stadium. Showcasing his football skills at school, his PE teacher saw his talent and recommended him to RKS Stocznia P√≥≈Çnocna, a now defunct team in Gda≈Ñsk. Puszkarz made a big impact for Stocznia, and after a big win against the Lechia Gda≈Ñsk youth team, Puszkarz was offered the chance to train with Lechia. Puszkarz spent 4 years in the Lechia youth system, he often spent time training with then Lechia captain Roman Korynt.  Senior career  During the 1967-68 season Puszkarz often played with the youth team, before making his senior debut in a 2-1 defeat to Arkonia Szczecin. Over the next 4 seasons Puszkarz became a regular for Lechia while they played in the third tier. During this period Puszkarz scored a total of 18 goals, two of these came in the 5-0 win over Czarny Szczecin, the game which secured Lechia's promotion to the second tier of Polish football. The next 10 years saw Lechia playing in the second tier, finishing 3 of those seasons as runners up, and narrowly missing out on promotion to the Ekstraklasa. During this time Puszkarz contributed 33 goals for the team in their continual bid for promotion. Despite Lechia playing in the second tier, Puszkarz was called up to the Poland squad in 1975 to play against East Germany. In his only game for Poland the team won 2-1, with Puszkarz coming of on the 46th minute with the scores still 0-0. In 1976 a Lechia matchday programme said of Puszkarz; \\"Zdzisiek is a true virtuoso of technique: with the ball every kick every nod, he does whatever he wants with it. Ambition, determination, speed, and conducting abilities - this is a list of his attributes, which he has recently enriched with no less important: effectiveness\\".Lechia Matchday Programme 1976 (1975-76 season) In 1982 Lechia suffered relegation to the third tier, and as a result Puszkarz left to join Ba≈Çtyk Gdynia. Despite many Ekstraklasa teams showing interest in Puszkarz over the years, it was only when Lechia were relegated and with Ba≈Çtyk Gdynia in the Ekstraklasa when he finally moved teams. This ensured that he could stay in the Tricity area where he had spent his whole life thus far. While at Ba≈Çtyk, Puszkarz played a total of 67 games, scoring 10 goals. After his time at Ba≈Çtyk, Puszkarz moved to Germany to play for Holstein Kiel where he spent 2 seasons, playing 54 games scoring 13 goals. It wasn't long before Puszkarz was back in Gda≈Ñsk when he signed for MOSiR Gda≈Ñsk. He played for MOSiR for a season before returning to Lechia Gda≈Ñsk. On 28 March 1987, at the age of 37, Puszkarz achieved his dream of playing in the Ekstraklasa with Lechia. His first appearance with Lechia ended as a 1-0 defeat to Widzew ≈Å√≥d≈∫. At the age of 38 Puszkarz made his final appearance for Lechia in a match against GKS Katowice on 11 June 1988, Lechia lost the match 2-1.  After football  Puszkarz is commemorated by a star at the MOSiR Stadium in Gda≈Ñsk. The \\"Avenue of Stars\\" commemorates the efforts and success of former players and coaches. In 2012 Puszkarz joined the Lechia youth set up. In 2013 he signed a new contract becoming the Lechia Gda≈Ñsk U21's assistant. In 2018 a mural of Zdzis≈Çaw Puszkarz was painted on the side of an apartment building in Gda≈Ñsk.

After winning her only race as a juvenile she improved to become one of the best three-year-old fillies in Europe in 2007, winning the Prix de la Grotte, Poule d'Essai des Pouliches, Prix d'Astarte and Prix du Moulin. In 2008 she compiled an unusual record: competing exclusively at the highest level she finished second in all of six of her races. She was rated the best horse of her age and sex in Europe in both 2007 and 2008. Background Darjina was a bay mare with a large white star and a white sock on her left foreleg, bred in France by her owner Zahra Aga Khan. She was trained during her track career by Alain de Royer-Dupr√© and was ridden in most of her races by Christophe Soumillon. Her sire Zamindar was a full-brother to Zafonic and recorded his biggest win in the Group Three Prix de Cabourg. He became a very successful sire of fillies, with his offspring including the multiple Group One winners Zarkava and Timepiece. Darjina's dam Darinska showed some racing ability, winning one minor race and running third in the Prix de Royaumont. She was a great- granddaughter of Darazina, whose other descendants have included Darsi, Daryakana, Darlan, Almanzor and Daryaba (Prix de Diane). Racing career=2006: two-year-old season= Darjina was ridden by Michael Poirier when she made her debut in a minor race over 1600 metres on Saint-Cloud Racecourse on 3 November and won \\"easily\\" by one and a half lengths. =2007: three-year-old season= On 15 April 2007 Darjina began her second campaign by starting the 1.8/1 favourite for the Group 3 Prix de la Grotte over 1600 metres at Longchamp Racecourse. After racing in second place for most of the way she took the lead 100 metres from the finish and won by a short neck and a length from Missvinski and Chinandega. Four weeks later she was stepped up in class for the Group 1 Poule d'Essai des Pouliches over the same course and distance and started the 6.5/1 second favourite behind the Irish filly Finsceal Beo. Of the other eleven runners, the only ones to start at less than 25/1 were Sender Camillo (Cherry Hinton Stakes), Peace Dream (undefeated in four races) and Rahiyah. After being restrained towards the rear of the field Darjina began to make steady progress on the outside in the straight. She moved into second behind Finsceal Beo 200 metres from the finish and caught the favourite on the line to win by a head. After the race Soumillon said \\"She accelerated brilliantly. She ran a bit green but that is understandable. I didn\`t think I had a chance when I got her free of the pack, but she simply would not be beaten and she will go on to even better things\\". In June Darjina was sent to England to contest the Coronation Stakes over one mile at Royal Ascot in which she started at odds of 7/2 and finished third behind Indian Ink and the German 1000 Guineas Mi Emma. The filly returned to France and was matched against older fillies and mares in the Prix d'Astarte (a race promoted to Group 1 level for the first time) over 1600 metres on soft ground at Deauville Racecourse on 29 July. She was ridden by Thierry Thulliez as Christophe Soumillon was serving a suspension for excessive use of the whip. She started joint-favourite alongside Simply Perfect in a twelve-runner field which also included Mi Emma, All Is Vanity (Prix de Sandringham), Utrecht (Prix Chlo√©) and Impressionnante (2006 Prix de Sandringham). Racing closer to the pace than in most of her previous races, Darjina went to the front 400 metres out and repelled several challengers before winning by half a length from Missvinski with Simply Perfect the same distance away in third. Alain de Royer-Dupr√© commented \\"Christophe divulged everything to Thulliez before the race and I thank him for being such a sportsman. This filly always finds something at the end of her races and she has plenty of stamina\\". On 9 September Darjina faced top class male opposition for the first time in the Prix du Moulin over 1600 metres at Longchamp and with Soumillon back in the saddle she was made the 4.5/1 third choice in the betting behind George Washington and Ramonti. The other seven runners included Turtle Bowl (Prix Jean Prat) and Astronomer Royal (Poule d'Essai des Poulains). After racing in third place behind Archipenko and Ramonti Darjina went to the front approaching the last 200 metres and pulled away to win by two lengths. Ramonti took second ahead of George Washington and Linngari. Three weeks later the filly was sent to Ascot for the second time to contest the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes but ran poorly and came home last of the seven runners behind Ramonti. For her final run of the year, Darjina was sent to Sha Tin Racecourse for the Hong Kong Mile on 9 December. She produced a strong late run to finish third of the thirteen runners behind Good Ba Ba and Creachadoir. In the 2007 World Thoroughbred Racehorse Rankings was given a rating of 122, level with Peeping Fawn and Sagara and one pound inferior to Rags to Riches. She was therefore rated the seventeenth-best racehorse in the world and the equal-best filly in Europe. =2008: four-year- old season= On her four-year-old debut, Darjina was sent to the United Arab Emirates to contest the Dubai Duty Free over 1900 metres at Nad Al Sheba Racecourse on 29 March. Starting at odds of 5/1 in a field which included Bullish Luck, Creachadoir, Finsceal Beo and Vodka she took the lead in the closing stages but was caught on the line and beaten half a length by the 50/1 outsider Jay Peg. On her return to Europe the filly started 4/5 favourite for the Prix d'Ispahan at Longchamp in May but was beaten into second by Sageburg. In June she ran for the second time at Royal Ascot and was beaten a head by the Australian horse Haradasun in the Queen Anne Stakes. On 2 August Darjina faced the leading three-year-old fillies Natagora, Goldikova and Nahoodh as she attempted to replicate her 2007 victory in the Prix d'Astarte (renamed the Prix Rothschild). After being restrained towards the rear by Soumillon she finished strongly but failed to overhaul Goldikova and finished second, beaten half a length. In the Prix du Moulin on 7 September Darjina was matched against Goldikova again with the same result: she was beaten half a length into second with Paco Boy, Sageburg, Henrythenavigator and Natagora finishing behind. Richard Hughes took the ride when Darjina was sent to Newmarket Racecourse on 4 October for her final race and started 11/10 favourite for the Sun Chariot Stakes. She finished second of the ten runners after failing by half a length to catch the front-running Halfway to Heaven. Despaite failing to win a race in 2008 Darjina was given a rating of 119 in the 2008 World Thoroughbred Rankings, making her the 52nd best racehorse in the world and the top-rated older female in Europe. On 13 October 2008 it was announced that Darjina had been retired from racing.

The force is mandated to maintain maritime safety, security, pollution control and sanitation. It is also responsible for apprehending and prosecuting offenders. Headquarters The headquarters of the agency are located in the Liwatoni neighbourhood, in the port city of Mombasa, on the north-eastern bank of Kilindini Harbour. The approximate geographical data of the headquarters of the Kenya Coast Guard Services are: 04¬∞04'10.0\\"S, 39¬∞39'27.0\\"E (Latitude:-4.069444, Longitude:39.657500). The agency has representation in all major ocean ports in the country, including Kilifi, Malindi and Lamu. It is also present on Lake Turkana and in the lake port of Kisumu, on the shores of Lake Victoria. Overview The agency consists of professional security personnel drawn from the Kenya Defence Forces, the Kenya National Police, the Kenya intelligence services and civilian professionals. On 14 November 2018, President Uhuru Kenyatta appointed Brigadier Vincent Naisho Loonena, a 20-year veteran of the Kenya Navy, as the first Director General of the government agency. The director- general has responsibility for the day-to-day management of the agency and the administration of discipline. The coast guard is responsible for patrolling Kenya's territorial waters, preventing unlawful fishing, piracy, human and drug trafficking, smuggling and prevention of environmental damage. It is hoped that the coast guard will reduce cross-border crime and increase the country's intelligence gathering and information sharing ability. History In 2016, the Business Daily Africa reported that Kenya lost an estimated KSh10 billion (US$100 million) in revenue, annually, due to illegal fishing alone. Partly to mitigate this loss, the Parliament of Kenya adopted the Coast Guard Act 2018, which established the Kenya Coast Guard Service. The law was operationalized on 22 October 2018, when Kenya's Interior Minister gazetted the Parliamentary Act. Governance The coast guard is entirely separate from the Kenyan Navy. The agency is supervised by the Coast Guard Service Council, chaired by the Cabinet Secretary for Internal Affairs. Other council members include the cabinet secretaries for Defence, Environment and Forestry, Transport and Infrastructure, and Housing and Urban Development. Other members include the Chief of the Kenya Defence Forces, the Inspector General of the Kenya National Police Service, representative of the Ministry of Transport, representative of the Ministry of Fisheries and others that may be added at a later date. Jane's Defence Weekly, on the other hand, reported that the vessel was delivered to the Kenyan Ministry of Fisheries, Livestock and Agriculture. The first-ever Director General of the KCGS is Brigadier Vincent Naisho Loonena, a senior officer of the Kenya Navy, with more than 20 years experience. Equipment A new marine vessel, the coast guard's first, was procured in 2017 at a cost of KSh3.6 billion. This vessel, the offshore patrol vessel MV Doria, was commissioned on 19 November 2018. The Doria has been described as the mother ship around which the coast guard fleet will be built. MV Doria was built by Western Marine Shipyard of Bangladesh and delivered to the Kenya Ministry of Ministry of Fisheries, Livestock and Agriculture in August 2017. Until more vessels are built the coast guard will rely heavily on assistance from the Kenyan Navy.

The senior-most Chief of Staff was appointed to serve as a Chairman until he retired. The last Chairman was the Chief of the Army Staff General Bipin Rawat. After the creation of the position of Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), he will also be the permanent chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee (CoSC). Until now, the chairmanship of the CoSC was held in rotation by the senior-most service chief for short periods and the arrangement was found to be unsatisfactory. History The Chiefs of Staff Committee was established on 15 August 1947 upon Indian independence, and was conceived as the \\"supreme professional body\\" to advise the Minister of Defence and the Cabinet Committee on Political Affairs on all military-related matters. The Chairman of the Committee was the senior-most of the three Commanders-in-Chief (Chiefs of Staff from 1955) of the three armed forces. General Sir Robert Lockhart was the first chairman, with General K.M. Cariappa appointed the first Indian chairman on 14 October 1951. Following the end of the Kargil war, Kargil Review Committee found there was a lack of communication between the service branches, and therefore suggested to create the position of Chief of Defence Staff (CDS). This was however rejected by many members of the military, arguing that only great or imperial powers engaging in power projection needed that amount of integration. A compromise was reached with the office of the CoSC. The Chairman was responsible for inter-service synergy. However, as the chairman, CoSC only served as Primus inter pares to the other Chiefs of Staff, he did not wield any power. The Chairman was assisted by the Integrated Defence Staff.Integrated Defence Staff. History of Integrated Defence Staff. National Informatics Center. Talks concerning the creation of a Chief of Defence Staff position continued for over a decade, along with a suggestion the position of chairman be made permanent, with a renewable two year term.

In the 2018 reboot, She-Ra and the Princesses of Power, Catra is one of the major antagonists for the first four seasons before becoming an ally to the heroes in its final season. In the series finale of the reboot, she also professes her love for the protagonist, Adora. In both animated series, Catra is the Force-Captain of Hordak's Evil Horde, a position previously held by Adora before she defected. In the first series, Catra displays minor sorcery abilities, possessing a magical mask, which when slid over her face gives the ability to transform into a purple panther-like beast, also showing telepathic control over all cats; in the second series she has cat-like features of her own, including a tail, large furry ears, and claws. In the toyline, she is the principal villain. In She-Ra: Princess of Power (1985)=Fictional character biography= In Filmation's She-Ra: Princess of Power cartoon series, Hordak is the leader of the Evil Horde, with Catra as of one of his minions. However, when the Princess of Power toyline was released, Mattel decided to make the male Evil Horde characters part of the Masters of the Universe toyline, and therefore Catra became She-Ra's nemesis in the Princess of Power toyline instead. When a race called the Magicats were taken prisoner, their Queen set out to find them. However, the Queen was also captured and imprisoned by Hordak. Without the magical mask which bestowed on her the title of Queen, she was powerless to escape. Hordak had taken the mask from her and had given it to Catra, from which she gained additional feline qualities to those of her native Purrsia, and the ability to transform into a large panther. To transform into her feline state, Catra slides the mask from her forehead over her eyes. In her cat form, she retains the ability to speak and possesses greater strength than her human form. When Adora is reconciled with her twin brother Adam, she leaves the Horde and is replaced by Catra as the Force-Captain. Several times, while serving Hordak, Catra strikes out on her own, showing that she does not need Hordak. This is quite evident when Catra betrays Hordak to Skeletor, in an attempt to overthrow him. Even though there are a few other female villains in The Horde, Catra does not get on that well with any of them, only working with them as a last resort. She appears to have a particularly intense rivalry with fellow female villain Scorpia. Along with the other Horde members, Catra holds an intense hatred for Imp. With the magical mask, Catra is able to transform into a panther with light purple fur. One of the most overlooked details about Catra is that she also possesses the power of teleportation. She only demonstrates this ability on one occasion and it is uncertain where this power originates, although it is assumed that it is another power bestowed by her magical mask. However, the Magicat elder, Tao states that the Queen kept virtually all of the mask's powers secret, so this is unlikely. However, Tao does reveal one of the powers to Catra called Freezefire, which generates an energy beam that can encase its target in ice. Catra has subsequently lost any knowledge of this power. Additionally, the Magicat Percival, states that once the mask has been used for evil, it can no longer be used for good. Clawdeen Catra is also the owner of a pink lion named Clawdeen. Clawdeen only appears once during the series' run. In that episode, she scares the rebels into the Cage-Mines so The Horde can capture them. Bow traps her in one of the Cage-Mines and she is never seen again. In the Ladybird books, Clawdeen is female (despite looking like a male lion in the animated series) and only referred to as a giant cat. Nonetheless, she can talk and is Catra's mode of transportation. She also appears in the mini-comic \\"A Born Champion\\", but has a minor role. In She-Ra and the Princesses of Power (2018‚Äì2020) In the 2018 series, a teenage Catra was a childhood friend of Adora, raised alongside her by their trainer/mother- figure, Shadow Weaver. Though Adora defended Catra from Shadow Weaver's emotional abuse throughout their childhood, Catra resented Adora for the favoritism shown to her by Shadow Weaver. Furthermore, unlike Adora, Catra is well aware of the Horde's manipulations and accepted it for the sake of her own ambitions. After Adora defects from the Horde, Catra rejects her former friend's attempt to talk her into leaving as well. Stevenson explains: \\"Catra's feelings of betrayal towards Adora are personal. Adora's more idealistic, and she loves everyone in the world and wants to save everybody. Catra can't understand or accept that. That's the core tragedy, not just of the characters, but of the show.\\" Catra seizes the opportunity to prove herself to the Horde and is quickly promoted to Force Captain by Lord Hordak. Although her plan to capture Adora fails, Catra is able win the allegiance of the eccentric genius Princess Entrapta, providing the Horde with new technology for an attempted conquest of Etheria. Although that plan fails as well, Catra impresses Hordak enough to replace Shadow Weaver as his second in command. During the second and third seasons, Hordak begins losing faith in Catra due to her arrogance and putting her personal grudges before the Horde's agenda. When Shadow Weaver is due to be exiled, she tricks Catra into providing the means for her to escape. As punishment for her mistake, she is sent on a dangerous mission in the hazardous desert of the Crimson Waste. There she becomes the leader of a local band of bandits, and is tempted to abandon the Horde for her new life in the desert, but when she learns that Shadow Weaver has defected to the rebels, her resentment and jealousy of Adora drives her to return to the Horde. Obsessed with vengeance, she activates Hordak's experimental portal even though she knows it might destroy the planet, and then blames Entrapta for its failure. In the fourth season, Catra coerces Hordak into letting her command the Horde's war effort, and hires shapeshifting mercenary Double Trouble to sow dissent in the Rebellion. But the Horde's victories leave Catra unsatisfied, as her obsession with proving herself drives off her few remaining friends. When Hordak learns the truth of Entrapta's exile from Double Trouble, he attacks her, but she immobilizes him. Double Trouble switches sides, enabling the Rebellion to reverse the Horde's gains. Their analysis of Catra's character flaws causes her to emotionally break down and accept her defeat. At the end of the season, Catra is taken aboard the ship of Horde Prime, Hordak's creator, along with Glimmer, and manages to convince him to refrain from destroying Etheria in order to use it as a weapon. At the start of the fifth and final season, Catra‚Äîeffectively held prisoner on Horde Prime's ship‚Äîbegins to question her past behavior. This meditation leads Catra to attempt to sacrifice her life so as to save Glimmer's. This act of redemption encourages Glimmer, Adora, Bow, and Entrapta to in turn rescue Catra from Horde Prime's clutches. After her rescue, Catra repudiates her past behavior and actively fights alongside Adora and her friends. In the series finale, Catra accompanies Adora to the Heart of Etheria; it is only after Catra professes her love for Adora that the latter is able to free the magic of Etheria from Horde Prime's clutches. Throughout the series, it is hinted that Adora and Catra harbor romantic feelings for each other. In the series finale, this is confirmed, when the two mutually confess their love for each other and kiss. In popular culture Catra appears in the Robot Chicken episode \\"Slaughterhouse on the Prairie\\", voiced by Eden Espinosa. She accompanies Scorpia and Entrapta into attacking Castle Bright Moon only to be impaled on Scorpia's tail by She-Ra. Reception Comic Book Resources listed the original incarnation of the character in He- Man: Eternia‚Äôs 15 Mightiest Villains.

The Foreign Correspondents' Club (FCC) scheduled a lunchtime talk for 14 August. The invitee was Andy Chan, convenor of the Hong Kong National Party (HKNP); Victor Mallet, vice-chairman of the press organisation, chaired the session. The government of China had called for the cancellation of the talk, and Hong Kong government expressed its regret because the issue of independence was said to cross the red lines on national sovereignty. After a visit to Bangkok, Mallet was denied a working visa by the Hong Kong government. Mallet was subjected to a four-hour interrogation by immigration officers on his return from Thailand on Sunday, 7 October before he was finally allowed to enter Hong Kong. In the absence of an official explanation, Mallet's visa rejection was widely seen to be retribution for his role in chairing the Chan talk, which the FCC refused to cancel. The Hong Kong Journalists Association, which has for years lived under the pressure of self- censorship, immediately warned of the \\"death knell of freedom of speech\\". Secretary for Security John Lee insisted the ban on Mallet was unrelated to press freedom, but declined to explain the decision. The incident caused a furious debate over the one country, two systems model which Deng Xiaoping promised for Hong Kong, and over restrictions to freedoms that were promised in the Sino-British Joint Declaration which included a \\"high degree of autonomy\\", democratic reforms, and maintenance of the freedom of the press.  Background  The Hong Kong National Party is a local political group that advocates the independence of Hong Kong, and the government of the People's Republic of China in Beijing considers it to be a separatist organisation. In September 2018, in an unprecedented step for the city, it became the first ever political party to be proscribed by the Hong Kong government. As part of its regular lunchtime talk series, the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Hong Kong (FCC) hosted an event to take place on 14 August 2018. The invitee was Andy Chan, convenor of the Hong Kong National Party (HKNP), a political party that was facing a ban by the government of Hong Kong. Victor Mallet was to chair the session. The Beijing government wanted the FCC to cancel the luncheon talk by Chan. The Chinese Foreign Ministry's Hong Kong office issued an announcement on 3 Aug, stating its resolute opposition to \\"any external forces providing a platform for the independence forces to spread their absurd ideas\\". On the other hand, the HK government expressed \\"deep regrets\\" over the FCC's decision to host the talk. Many leading pro-Beijing political figures, notably former chief executive CY Leung, vocally opposed and tried to pressure and intimidate the FCC to rescind the invitation in the days running up to the talk. Leung argued that the FCC was leasing its premises, the Old Dairy Farm Depot, from the government, and said that it was paying \\"token rent\\" when it was in fact paying market rent. The HK government said: \\"It is totally inappropriate and unacceptable for any person to openly promote and advocate the independence of Hong Kong, [and] as such, it is also totally inappropriate and unacceptable for any organisation to provide a public platform to espouse such views.\\" In its own defence, the FCC said that it neither opposed nor endorsed the views of its guest speakers. It insisted that the public has a right to hear the views of different sides of any debate as Hong Kong is governed by the rule of law, and respect for freedom of speech was enshrined. When the government-owned broadcaster Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK) and local stations all declined to broadcast the event, the FCC arranged for the speech to be live-streamed on Facebook.  Refused visa  As the controversy blew up, Victor Mallet was Asia news editor of the Financial Times based in Hong Kong where he lived with his family. He was vice-president of the FCC. Mallet and his employer attempted to renew his working visa in the normal way but were notified late on 2 October that his visa, which expired on 3 October, would not be renewed. No reasons were given. Returning from a visit to Bangkok, Mallet found out that he had been denied a working visa by the Hong Kong government. He was subsequently allowed to return on a seven-day visit after being interrogated by Hong Kong immigration. As British citizens are normally allowed to visit without a visa for business and pleasure for up to 180 days, the government's decision was heavily criticised by opposition lawmakers. It was however welcomed by their pro-establishment counterparts. A spokesperson for the Financial Times, said \\"[t]his is the first time we have encountered [a refusal to renew the work visa] in Hong Kong, and we have not been given a reason for the rejection.\\" On 8 November, Mallet attempted to enter Hong Kong again as a visitor, but was turned away after four hours of questioning at immigration, again without being given a reason. Mallet had ostensibly hoped to resign vice-presidency of the FCC, a post he has held since 2017, and also to hand over his responsibilities at the Financial Times properly. A government source merely stated that border control cases of the territory were considered on a case-by-case basis.  Political reaction  In the absence of an official explanation, Mallet's visa rejection was widely seen to be retribution for his role in chairing the Chan talk which the FCC refused to call off. The FCC, the organisation at the centre of the controversy, does not support independence for Hong Kong. It said that the incident: ‚Äúhighlight[s] Beijing's tightening grip on the territory and the steady erosion of basic rights that are guaranteed in Hong Kong's laws and international agreements\\". On demanding a full explanation from the Hong Kong authorities for the extraordinary, extremely rare, if not unprecedented move, the FCC initiated a petition in October asking the government to provide a full explanation for the visa refusal. Furthermore, 19 former FCC presidents signed a letter to the Chief Executive in early November, urging the government to explain Mallet's case. Secretary for Security John Lee insisted the ban on Mallet was unrelated to press freedom, but declined to explain the decision, citing \\"data privacy considerations\\". Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam said that the Immigration Department was not obliged to explain individual cases.The Legislative Council of Hong Kong rejected a motion to summon immigration officials to the legislature to answer for the Victor Mallet case. The motion failed when 36 pro-establishment lawmakers out-voted 24 pan-democrat lawmakers. Passage of the motion would have forced Security Minister John Lee Ka-chiu to explain the decision not to renew Mallet's visa. Lee argued that disclosure of individual cases would undermine immigration controls and security, and that not disclosing reasons for visa refusals is also common practice overseas, and that only 1.3 percent of applications had been refused so far in 2018. He added that compliance with Hong Kong laws was a must. British consul general in Hong Kong Andrew Heyn wrote to Carrie Lam about Mallet's denial of entry. Mark Field, British minister of state for Asia and the Pacific, warned that the controversy could affect business sentiment in the city. He expressed concern that the increasing signs of pressure upon \\"one country, two systems\\" would undermine business confidence. Field was scheduled to meet Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung as he passed through Hong Kong. Malcolm Rifkind, the British foreign secretary from 1995 to 1997, criticised the visa ruling as a \\"bizarre decision\\". He said that Hong Kong's core values, including free expression and the rule of law, were under pressure. Saying that \\"‚Äònational security‚Äô was increasingly being used to justify disproportionate constrictions on fundamental rights\\", Rifkind urged Hong Kong to retract their decision, saying that the rule of law and basic freedoms had been a bedrock of Hong Kong's prosperity and stability. Equally, former Chief Secretary Anson Chan echoed the sentiment about the government's decision as a threat to business confidence. On the other hand, pro-Beijing lawmaker Starry Lee of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong said \\"For the FCC to ignore the warning from China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, that's a very serious provocation\\". Another legislator Priscilla Leung was quoted saying \\"There is no room for using journalism as a disguise for promoting independence or self-determination.\\" Governments of the US and the European Union have all expressed concerns over Mallet's visa refusal and urged Hong Kong to explain the decision. US publications like The New York Times and The Washington Post expressed their concerns over the case in the US in editorials respectively entitled \\"China's Media Crackdown Spreads to Hong Kong\\" and \\"China's Authoritarian Export\\". Marco Rubio, co-chairman of US Congressional Executive Commission on China, asserted that Beijing's tactics used in the past to pressurise foreign news agencies in China were now being \\"extended to Hong Kong\\". The Hong Kong Journalists Association expressed its shock and anger at the government, saying: \\"Freedom of speech and press freedom are the foundations of Hong Kong‚Äôs success. The denial of [Mallet‚Äôs] visa will further harm press freedom and freedom of speech, and it will severely harm Hong Kong's status as an international city.\\" Reporters Without Borders and the Hong Kong Bar Association also criticised the apparent ban of Mallet.On Carrie Lam's maiden visit to Japan, local journalists questioned her intensely over the government's decision to refuse a work visa for Mallet. Lam refused to comment except to cite the fact that \\"so many overseas media, including Japanese media, have been using Hong Kong as a base for reporting is by itself a very good indication of the freedom of reporting, of journalism, in Hong Kong\\". The state-run China Daily responded to the criticisms saying that visa renewal of the territory was a sovereign right that no other governments could interfere with. It accused foreign governments of grandstanding: \\"What they really want is not an answer but to create the illusion that freedom of speech and the press in Hong Kong is dwindling... the accusers‚Äô real intention is to smear the way ‚Äòone country, two systems‚Äô is being practised.\\"  See also  * Knife attack on Kevin Lau * Censorship in Hong Kong * Immigration Department (Hong Kong)#List of notable activists refused entry to Hong Kong  References  2018 in Hong Kong Politics of Hong Kong Mass media in Hong Kong Political repression in China October 2018 events in China Human rights in Hong Kong ","title":"Victor Mallet visa controversy"},{"id":"59067164","text":"Giaura tortricoides is a moth of the family Nolidae first described by Francis Walker in 1865.

It was established in 1756 on the initiative of Chancellor Alexey Bestuzhev-Ryumin. It was abolished in 1762. Formally considered an advisory body, but in most cases acted independently on behalf of the empress. The conference used legislative power, gave instructions and orders to the Senate, the Synod, the colleges and other central institutions of the empire. Origin As a permanent institution, it emerged along the lines of the Austrian Hofkriegsrat from the \\"Conference on Foreign Affairs\\" ‚Äî non-periodically convened meetings that replaced the Cabinet of Ministers and gathered at the court according to the decree of Elizabeth Petrovna of December 23, 1741 to discuss the most important foreign policy issues. At a meeting of conference ministers on March 14, 1756, it was announced that the empress was instructed to hold such meetings regularly, on certain days and with a permanent composition of participants. Powers, working order and composition The terms of reference and the terms of reference for the Conference were not clearly defined. Formally, the Conference was equal in its significance to the Senate and the Synod, but by decree of October 5, 1756, it received the right to send them \\"resolutions to execution\\" in the form of extracts from the protocols. The conference sent rescripts to the headquarters (on behalf of the empress) and received in response the reports (again addressed to Elizabeth Petrovna). The objectives and the order of work of the Conference were set forth in the minutes of the organizational meeting of the conference ministers of March 14, 1756. It did not become a body of national importance and solved special tasks, mainly related to conducting a coherent domestic and foreign policy on the eve of and during the Seven Years' War. The conference consisted of the \\"presence\\" of the conference ministers and the office. The \\"presence\\" of ex officio included the heads of the diplomatic, military and naval departments, the head of the Office of Secret Investigative Affairs and the Senate Prosecutor General. In addition to them, to the order of the Empress, the members of the \\"presence\\" were the most influential senators and (during the first year of the Conference) the heir to the throne, Grand Duke Pyotr Fyodorovich. The secretary of the Conference and the head of its office was Dmitry Volkov, who had a staff of 12 people (secretaries, recorders, translators, couriers). Activity The scope of the Conference‚Äôs activities included general management of diplomatic relations through the Collegium of Foreign Affairs, development of draft treaties, conventions, declarations and other documents of an international character, general management of the Russian armed forces, control over the activities of commanders-in-chief, development of plans for military campaigns against Prussia, and management of the K√∂nigsberg Province occupied during the war. It is through the Conference that the most significant projects of Count Peter Shuvalov are being carried out: Shuvalov's 12-pound licornes, formation of the Western Corps, monetary reform and the creation of the Copper Bank. The conference dealt with many administrative and personnel issues, but its domestic policy activities were selective only to a limited extent limited to the prerogatives of the Senate. The council met twice a week, on Mondays and Thursdays. In national historiography, a negative assessment of the Conference‚Äôs activities has been adopted. So, Anton Kersnovsky, the author of the well-known \\"History of the Russian Army\\", finds that the Conference was ‚Äúunder Russian conditions a worsened edition of the notorious \\"Hofkriegsrat\\": Abolition After the accession of Emperor Peter III on January 5, 1762, the Conference lost its independent significance and was abolished by imperial decree of February 8, 1762 in connection with the planned withdrawal of Russia from the Seven Years' War. The functions of the Conference were later transferred to the Council under Peter III (Imperial Council, later, under Catherine II, \\"Council at the Highest Court\\"), who inherited the office of the Office of the Conference and its office management system.

He has been involved in conservation efforts including protecting timber habitat of the northern spotted owl from logging, water for salmon and sucker fish in the Klamath Basin (Klamath Water Crisis), and the creation of Steens Mountain Wilderness and other preserves. He worked for the Oregon Natural Resources Council (later renamed Oregon Wild) in the 1970s and the Wilderness Society in 2000. The Oregonian said he was the most famous environmentalist in the state during the northern spotted owl timber controversy. He played a leading role in advocating for the Steens Mountain Wilderness preserve area. He also advocated, unsuccessfully, for population control measures in Oregon. According to the biography page on his website, Kerr is a fifth-generation Oregonian and was born and raised in Creswell, Oregon, a former timber town in the upper Willamette Valley. He now lives in Ashland, Oregon and Washington, D.C. When Kerr bought a log house in Eastern Oregon during the 1990s it caused some controversy because of his anti-logging advocacy.

Similar to the DevOps or DataOps approaches, MLOps looks to increase automation and improve the quality of production ML while also focusing on business and regulatory requirements. While MLOps also started as a set of best practices, it is slowly evolving into an independent approach to ML lifecycle management. MLOps applies to the entire lifecycle - from integrating with model generation (software development lifecycle, continuous integration/continuous delivery), orchestration, and deployment, to health, diagnostics, governance, and business metrics. History The challenges of the ongoing use of machine learning in applications were highlighted in a 2015 paper titled, Hidden Technical Debt in Machine Learning Systems. The predicted growth in machine learning includes an estimated doubling of ML pilots and implementations from 2017 to 2018, and again from 2018 to 2020. Spending on machine learning is estimated to reach $57.6 billion by 2021, a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 50.1%. Reports show a majority (up to 88%) of corporate AI initiatives are struggling to move beyond test stages. However, those organizations that actually put AI and machine learning into production saw a 3-15% profit margin increases. In 2018, after having one presentation about ML productionization from Google, MLOps and approaches to it began to gain traction among AI/ML experts, companies, and technology journalists as a solution that can address the complexity and growth of machine learning in businesses.  Architecture  There are a number of barriers that prevent organizations from successfully implementing ML across the enterprise, including difficulties with: * Deployment and automation * Reproducibility of models and predictions * Diagnostics * Governance and regulatory compliance * Scalability * Collaboration * Business uses * Monitoring and management A standard practice, such as MLOps, takes into account each of the aforementioned areas, which can help enterprises optimize workflows and avoid issues during implementation. A common architecture of an MLOps system would include data science platforms where models are constructed and the analytical engines where computations are performed, with the MLOps tool orchestrating the movement of machine learning models, data and outcomes between the systems.

She was sunk in action with Japanese destroyers on 25 October 1942.  World War II  The wooden hulled diesel-engine purse seiner fishing vessel Endeavor ‚Äì completed in May 1940 at San Diego, Calif., was acquired by the U.S. Navy from Joe C. Mouise of San Diego under a bare-boat charter. Accepted by the Navy on 17 February 1942, the ship, designated as a district patrol vessel, YP-284, began undergoing conversion at the Campbell Machine Co. yard the same day. YP-284 was placed in service on 23 February 1942. YP-284 cleared San Francisco, for the Panama Canal Zone on 5 March 1942. Pausing briefly at San Diego, she sailed from that port on the 9th, and arrived in isthmian waters on 25 March. Having been transferred to the Hawaiian Sea Frontier on 18 March, during her voyage southward, YP-284 set course northward, and returned to San Diego on 22 April, then sailed for the Hawaiian Islands on 6 May. The former purse seiner arrived at Pearl Harbor at a momentous time, for Adm. Chester W. Nimitz, Commander in Chief, U.S. Pacific Fleet, apprised of an impending Japanese operation targeting Midway, was taking steps to meet the enemy. Among those plans was stationing district patrol vessels at various islets and islands in the Hawaiian chain, grouping four YPs into Task Force (TF) 4, assigned to the Hawaiian Sea Frontier. YP-284, along with YP-290, YP-345, and YP-350, set out from Pearl Harbor on at the close of the first dog watch [1800] on 20 May 1942. YP-284 reached Lisianski Island on the 27th, the day Adm. Nimitz promulgated Operation Plan No. 29-42, ‚Äúto prevent the capture and occupation of Midway by enemy forces.‚Äù YP-290 went to Laysan Island, YP-345 to Gardner Pinnacles, and YP-350 to Necker Island, while the armed yacht Crystal (PY-25), took station at Pearl and Hermes Reef, the last-named ship arriving on 2 June 1942. The Battle of Midway occurred between 4 and 7 June, and resulted in the destruction of four of the Imperial Japanese Navy's carriers, all of its embarked air units, and a large percentage of trained maintenance people. YP-284 and her near- sisterships, meanwhile, patrolled their assigned areas and stood ready to assist downed aircraft, and eventually returned to Pearl, with YP-284 clearing Lisianski on 10 June. YP-290 sailed from Laysan the same day, YP-345 and YP-350 brought up the rear soon thereafter. Transferred to the South Pacific Force on 23 July 1942, YP-284 sailed for Guadalcanal on 29 August 1942 in company with YP-239 and YP-346, with the destroyer Helm (DD-388) escorting the converted tuna clippers. The little group reached its destination without incident on 1 September. Fate On 25 October 1942, the fleet tug Seminole (AT-65) departed Tulagi for Guadalcanal at 0510 with 500 drums of aviation gasoline on board, as well as four 75-millimeter howitzers and associated equipment, a portable derrick, and 75 marines under Capt. Wade H. Hitt, USMC, from Battery I, Third Battalion, Tenth Marines. The tug reached her unloading point about 3.5 miles east of Lunga Point at 0700. YP-284, with Warrant Officer Christian Rasmussen in command, sailed from Tulagi at 0740 that day and set course for Guadalcanal with 46 marines, also from Battery I, Third Battalion, Tenth Marines, under Capt. William E. Boney, USMCR ‚Äì who had only transferred from Battery H of the battalion six days earlier ‚Äì on board as well as 28 drums of aviation gasoline, and 3,600 rounds of 75-millimeter ammunition. YP-284 reached her unloading point at 0940 and lay-to, awaiting tank lighters to come out from Guadalcanal to disembark her passengers and unload her cargo. Seminole, interrupted once by an air raid alarm, managed to unload the howitzers and about 200 drums of aviation gasoline. A little over a half-hour later, however, at 1015, on board YP-284, WO Rasmussen received orders from Naval Operating Base (NOB) Cactus [Guadalcanal], to return to Tulagi with her passengers and cargo. Seminole received identical orders about that time. At 1030, YP-284, her course set for Tulagi, sighted ‚Äúthree unknown vessels‚Äù headed for Guadalcanal from the direction of Savo Island. WO Rasmussen immediately radioed Tulagi, inquiring ‚Äúif vessels were friendly.‚Äù Receiving a ‚Äúnegative,‚Äù the district patrol vessel also sighted the high-speed minesweepers Trever (DMS-16) and Zane (DMS-14) ‚Äì misidentifying them as ‚Äúdestroyers‚Äù (an understandable error, however, given their having been destroyers prior to their conversion) ‚Äì clearing Tulagi, standing to the east. The enemy ships, which proved to be the destroyers Akatsuki (Lt. Cmdr. Takasaku Osamu), Ikazuchi (Lt. Cmdr. Maeda Sanehu) and Shiratsuyu (Lt. Cmdr. Hashimoto Kanematsu) ‚Äì soon took Trever and Zane under fire and increased speed to overtake the two minesweepers. Meanwhile, WO Rasmussen had YP-284 increase speed, too, but doggedly maintained course for Tulagi ‚Äúas,‚Äù he wrote later, ‚ÄúI figured that the Jap destroyers would keep up engagement with our destroyers.‚Äù The former tuna clipper's charmed life, however, did not last much longer, as the trio of Japanese warships ‚Äúchanged course to intercept YP-284 and Seminole‚Ä¶‚Äù Seeing the enemy alter course in his direction (1045), Rasmussen immediately steered for Guadalcanal. Five minutes later (1050), though, the enemy obtained the range. The Japanese‚Äô second 5-inch salvo crashed into YP-284‚Äôs starboard quarter, setting fire to the cargo; more salvoes struck in quick succession, with a direct hit on the engine room damaging the ammonia receivers and filling the ship with fumes. WO Rasmussen ordered the engines stopped as the doomed little ship came to a halt five miles from shore, and sailors and marines abandoned ship as the enemy continued to fire. Soon thereafter, the Japanese shifted their full attention to Seminole, the majority of their shells passing through the vessel without exploding, others setting fire to her cargo, burning gasoline flowing down through the perforated decks. Seminole sounded ‚Äúabandon ship‚Äù at 1120, going down 1,000 yards off Koli Point in about 20 fathoms. Miraculously, only one sailor died on board the tug.

He is better known as the father of Oei Tiong Ham, Majoor-titulair der Chinezen (1866‚Äì1924), who modernized and vastly expanded the Oei family's business empire. Biography=Early life= Born on June 23, 1835, into a family of modest means in Tong'an, Tjoan-tjioe, (Zhangzhou) Fujian, a southern province of Imperial China, Oei Tjie Sien was the sixth son of Oei Tjhing In. According to family tradition, the elder Oei was a petty government official, but the colonial Indonesian historian Liem Thian Joe suggested that the family was of peasant origin. Regardless, his father ensured that the younger Oei received a classical Chinese education. This could have given Oei Tjie Sien a respectable career as a teacher or minor bureaucrat; but he participated instead in the Taiping Rebellion (1850-1864) against the then reigning Qing Dynasty. During the rebellion, he rose up the ranks and was put in charge of logistics. =Life and career in colonial Indonesia= Avoiding the Qing government's suppression of the rebels, Oei left his first wife in China and fled in 1858 to Semarang, Central Java in the Dutch East Indies or today's Indonesia. Aged only 23, Oei's Indonesian career began as a door-to-door peddler of diverse goods, from chinaware to rice. Once financially independent, Oei married a locally-born Peranakan woman, Tjan Bien Nio (1839-1896), who came from a middle-class merchant family. Together, the couple slowly built their business and had, among others, three sons: Oei Tiong Ham, Oei Tiong Bing and Oei Tiong Tjhian. They also had four daughters: Siok Nio, Bok Nio, Thiem Nio and Koen Nio. By a concubine, Oei also had a fourth son, Oei Tiong An. Oei sent his sons to a traditional Chinese school, where they mostly learned the Chinese classics and some rudimentary arithmetics. The Chinese quarter in colonial Semarang. By 1863, Oei and his business partner, Ang Thay Liang, had accumulated enough capital to establish a kongsi or business partnership, named 'Kian Gwan', which was then registered with the colonial authorities. The new company dealt in both Chinese products, such as tea, herbs and silk, as well as in Indonesian commodities, including rice, sugar, tobacco and gambier. Kian Gwan prospered in the economic boom that followed the Agrarian Law of 1870, which opened up agricultural land in Java to private capital. Oei's newfound wealth secured him an official pardon from the Qing government in 1874, and the prestige of landownership in 1878 through his acquisition of the particuliere landerij or private domain of Simongan, an estate of 1,300 hectares outside Semarang. As landheer or landlord of Simongan, Oei - unlike his Jewish predecessor - allowed access free of charge to the venerable Chinese shrine of Sam Poo Kong, located on the estate. The new landlord's generosity endeared him to the local Chinese community. Oei also obtained the Dutch colonial government's permission in 1880 to move from Semarang's Chinese quarter to Simongan, where - away from business - he lived the more prestigious lifestyle of a landlord and scholar, laying out a garden and his family graveyard, and eventually in retirement, tending to his lotuses. Despite their wealth, noted Howard Dick, Oei's family was still 'one step removed from the peranakan aristocracy (cabang atas)'. In 1884, Oei arranged for his eldest son and chosen successor, Oei Tiong Ham, to marry Goei Bing-nio, the fourth daughter of a Cabang Atas family that had been prominent in Semarang for over a century. The younger Oei sealed his family's social ascent with a hallowed appointment in 1886 to the government position of Luitenant der Chinezen. This high-ranking post of the Chinese officership gave Oei not only the deference of the Chinese community, but also significant legal and political jurisdiction over them under the Dutch colonial system of indirect rule. By the mid-1880s, the elder Oei seems to have given his eldest son a prominent role in Kian Gwan and the family's other business interests. The collapse in sugar prices in the mid-1880s ruined many established Cabang Atas families, thereby jeopardizing their domination of Java's revenue farms, in particular the lucrative opium farms. The parvenu Oeis, father and son, were ready to capitalize on the economic crisis and took over many revenue farms from ruined Cabang Atas families. In 1889, with Oei Tjie Sien as guarantor, his son Luitenant Oei Tiong Ham participated in one of the most important government auctions of the century - for the opium farms of Semarang, Surakarta, Yogyakarta, Madiun and Kedu, formerly belonging to a rival kongsi, headed by Luitenant Ho Tjiauw Ing. The poet Boen Sing Hoo in his Boekoe Sair Binatang calls the auction of 1889 a 'peperangan diantara raja- raja' ('a battle of kings'). Oei's son - dubbed 'Anak Sapi' (the 'Young Ox') by Boen - won the auction after a fierce bidding war against a Batavia-based kongsi, headed by Kapitein Loa Tiang Hoei and Kapitein Oey Hok Tjiang, doyens of the colonial Chinese establishment. In 1893, with his family on the rise, Oei Tjie Sien retired to his lotuses at Simongan, where he died was buried in 1900 at the age of 65. =Legacy and descendants= All four of Oei's daughters married into Cabang Atas families. Likewise, apart from Oei Tiong Tjhian who died young, all three of Oei's sons were elevated to the Chinese officership. His eldest, Luitenant Oei Tiong Ham, was further raised to the post of Kapitein der Chinezen in 1891, then to the honorary title of Majoor- titulair der Chinezen in 1901, the highest rank attainable to a Chinese subject in the Dutch East Indies. The elder Oei's second son, Oei Tiong Bing, was appointed a Luitenant in 1892, then a Kapitein in 1901; in 1903, he became the Majoor der Chinezen of Semarang, head of the city's colonial Chinese bureaucracy. The two Majoors' half-brother, Oei Tiong An, was appointed to the post of Luitenant der Chinezen of Salatiga, Central Java in 1925, a post he held until the abolition of the Chinese officership in 1935. Oei Tjie Sien's grandsons, Oei Tjong Hauw and Oei Tjong Tjay, eventually succeeded their grandfather and father, as heads of Kian Gwan from 1924 until 1961, and played an important role in the political and economic history of modern Indonesia and Southeast Asia. Oei Tjie Sien's granddaughter, the international socialite Oei Hui-lan, married the pre-communist Chinese statesman and diplomat V. K. Wellington Koo, and briefly acted as First Lady of the Republic of China. Kian Gwan, the company founded by Oei Tjie Sien, became the largest conglomerate in Southeast Asia in the early decades of the twentieth century, and retained that position until the nationalization of its Indonesian arm in 1961 by Indonesian President Sukarno's left-leaning government. The company's Indonesian branch survives as Rajawali Nusantara Indonesia, one of Indonesia's largest state-owned enterprises; Kian Gwan's branches in The Netherlands, and Thailand survive to this day on a more modest scale.

North Carolina, 560 U.S. 330 (2010), was an original jurisdiction United States Supreme Court case. It arose from a disagreement between the state of North Carolina and the other members of the Southeast Interstate Low- Level Radioactive Waste Management Compact over the funding for a joint project. Eight states had formed the compact in 1983 to manage low-level radioactive waste in the southeastern United States. In 1986, North Carolina was chosen as the location for the regional waste facility, and it asked the other states for funding to help with the project. The project stalled and was eventually shut down, despite North Carolina receiving $80 million from the other states. After the project's demise, the other states demanded their money back, but North Carolina refused to repay them, leading to this case.  Background  In 1980, Congress passed the Low Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act to authorize the creation of interstate agreements regarding the management of low-level radioactive waste. Accordingly, in 1983, North Carolina, along with the states of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia, formed the Southeast Interstate Low- Level Radioactive Waste Management Compact to coordinate their management of low-level radioactive waste. It was run by a commission, which was tasked with choosing a State in which to construct a \\"regional disposal facility\\". In 1986, the commission chose North Carolina, thus requiring it to begin the process of seeking a licence for the construction of such a facility. Two years later, North Carolina asked the other states for monetary assistance with the project, which it received ‚Äì by 1997, North Carolina had been paid more than $80 million. Yet, despite $34 million of North Carolina's own funds, it was unable to obtain the license in a timely fashion. In 1997, the commission told North Carolina that, without a plan for funding the rest of the licensing steps, it would be cut off; when it was, North Carolina began to shut down the project, claiming that it could not continue without additional funding. In response, in June 1999, Florida and Tennessee asked that the commission levy monetary sanctions against North Carolina. North Carolina responded by attempting to leave the Compact entirely. It based this decision on a clause which declared that \\"any party state may withdraw from the compact by enacting a law repealing the compact, provided that if a regional facility is located within such state, such regional facility shall remain available to the region for four years after the date the commission receives verification in writing from the Governor of such party state of the rescission of the Compact\\". The commission, in response to the complaint by Florida and Tennessee, demanded in December 1999 that, in addition to other monetary penalties, North Carolina repay approximately $80 million. The commission believed that, under article 7(F) of the original Compact, it had the power to level such monetary sanctions. However, North Carolina disagreed, and refused to comply with the commission's sanctions.  Case history  In 2003, the Supreme Court allowed Alabama, Florida, Tennessee, and Virginia (the only four remaining members of the Compact), and the commission to sue North Carolina under the Court's original jurisdiction. The plaintiffs requested \\"monetary and other relief, including a declaration that North Carolina is subject to sanctions and that the commission's sanctions resolution is valid and enforceable.\\" The case was assigned to a special master, who filed two reports. In January 2010, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments regarding the exceptions to the reports that were filed by both parties.  Decision  The Supreme Court overruled all of the states' objections to the Special Master's Reports. It held that the Compact did not give the commission the power to impose monetary sanctions against North Carolina; that the Court did not need to follow the commission's findings regarding North Carolina's supposed breach of its obligations; that North Carolina did not breach its obligations to take \\"appropriate steps\\" towards getting a license; and that North Carolina was allowed to withdraw from the Compact. The Court remanded the remainder of the case back to the Special Master to further adjudicate the equitable claims raised by the petitioners.  Subsequent history  In January 2011, the case was dismissed by agreement of the parties.

The design is based on the mixed traffic BR Standard 6 Clan Class, none of which were preserved. The project is akin to the construction of the 60163 Tornado. The project maintains a build diary, showing monthly progress of the build which has been ongoing since 2010. History=Background= The Clan class were a batch of 10 (pacific) locomotives built in the early 1950s. Their purpose was to be a lightweight version of the power class 7 Britannia locomotives that could operate over a wider variety of routes, albeit with slightly reduced power. The first batch was destined for Scotland, hence the name \\"Clan\\". Following experience with the first batch, a second batch of 15 was planned with design improvements. The first of these was to be allocated to the Southern Region with the number 72010 and name Hengist. However, due to a shortage of steel in the 1950s, and a change in motive power policy the order was postponed and later cancelled. No members of the class survived into preservation. 72006 Clan McKenzie was withdrawn in May 1966 and all were scrapped by August 1966. =Project= The Clan Project was initiated with the objective to create a new member of the class. As a go- anywhere engine with a low maintenance design, especially when incorporating improvements destined for the batch, the design should be most suitable for use on heritage railways as well as hauling rail tours. The engine is being built to modern mainline standards. The project was initially based at the Swanage Railway, but by 2017, the project was at the Great Central Railway where the completed cab and smokebox were displayed for a while, however logistics were to require a fourth move. The project is now based at the premises of CTL Seal in Sheffield. All of the components for the first phase of frame assembly are on site and assembly has commenced. Components for the bogie frame are either in stock or are being manufactured, and the aim is to start bogie frame assembly in early summer. Meanwhile, the pattern for the outside cylinders is under construction. Between 1951 and 1960, 999 BR Standard types were built across 12 classes and 72010, when completed, will be the 1000th.

He lives and works in Denver, Colorado. Weiner's works have been included in non-profit and university museums such as Mana Contemporary, HF Johnson Gallery of Art at Carthage College, Leeds Arts University, and York St John University as well as a variety of international gallery exhibitions in Australia, Belgium, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Life Paul Weiner was born in Denver, Colorado in 1993 and raised in Aurora, Colorado. Weiner graduated from Syracuse University with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree. He grew up a short distance from the site of the Columbine massacre and, later, the 2012 Aurora theater shooting. Work Weiner is best known for his large- scale American flag monoprint paintings and his works in charcoal on canvas. These works are notable for advancing the American flag painting lineage by using the American flag as a brush and material rather than an illusionistic element or painterly symbol. Weiner's gestural and abstract charcoal works, which reference current events, are created using giant willow branches and detritus from his studio. An article in Westword explains how, in his studio, \\"virtually every surface is covered in a layer of charcoal and paint.\\" The use of these processes was on display in the works shown at Krupic Kersting Gallery in Cologne, Germany, which received mixed reactions in critical circles. In a review of the 2018 exhibition highlights of the D√ºsseldorf Cologne Open, Die Welt's Alexandra Wach remarked that Weiner's works are \\"weniger lieblich\\" or \\"less lovely\\" but that they also gave insight into the dark sensitivities of his generation regarding American politics and democracy. Wach also commented on Weiner's work in Monopol Magazin f√ºr Kunst und Leben, where she described his American flag paintings as a \\"sp√§tromantische Ode an den Untergang\\" or \\"a late romantic ode to the downfall.\\" In a 2017 article regarding Weiner's residency at Long Road Projects in Jacksonville, Folio Weekly's Madeleine Peck Wagner described his flag paintings as \\"designed to challenge viewer's (and his own) notions of patriotism, nationalism and anxiety\\" and remarked that \\"censorship is a topic close to the artist. His earlier works dealt with how information is disseminated‚Äîpaintings that look like redacted documents‚Äîand these flag works take the literal fabric of patriotism as their material.\\" Weiner is also known for his earlier series of works focusing on the legal trial surrounding James Holmes and the 2012 Aurora theater shooting, which comment on the zeitgeist of a city rattled by mass violence and suggest peripheral issues relating to censorship within the American legal system. In the lead up to a 2016 exhibition, Concrete Playground's Sarah Ward described how \\"the community Denver artist Paul Weiner called his own was rocked by tragedy when a man opened fire in a Colorado movie theatre\\" and \\"the horrific events sparked another kind of art: a response.\\" 5280 Magazine describes how his redacted paintings, which are direct transcriptions of significant legal documents from this trial, \\"became more conceptual in nature\\" and \\"those dark black lines became a recurring element in Weiner's earliest explorations of the topic. Young Space's Kate Mothes describes the impact of \\"violence, especially in such close proximity to the Aurora cinema and its impact on his community\\" and how it \\"instilled an entirely new meaning and significance as an expression of self, the politics of painting, and his surroundings.\\" =Exhibitions= Weiner's solo and group exhibitions have taken place at Mana Contemporary, Chicago, IL; HF Johnson Gallery of Art, Carthage College, Kenosha, Wisconsin; Leeds Arts University, Leeds, UK; York St John University, York, UK; Krupic Kersting Gallery, Cologne, Germany; TWFINEART, Brisbane, Australia; Durden and Ray Gallery, Los Angeles, CA; Re:Art, Brooklyn, NY; MARQUEE Projects, Bellport, NY; SABOT/MIMI/FASTER, Berlin, Germany; Long Road Projects, Jacksonville, Florida; Alto Gallery, Denver, Colorado; Chabah Yelmani Gallery, Brussels, Belgium; YIA Art Fair, Brussels, Belgium; ARTBandini Fair, Los Angeles, California; Miscellaneous Press, Los Angeles, California; and CTRL+SHFT, Oakland, CA among others.

In 1881 the Universalists merged with the local Unitarian Society. In their arrangement, the Unitarians paid for the minister while the Universalists owned the church building. The University of Iowa bought their building in 1907 and renamed it Unity Hall for use as a student union. The Unitarian-Universalist congregation dedicated this Tudor Revival building for their use on October 24, 1908. The dedication address was given by Rev. Eleanor E.

The Hologon was originally fitted to a dedicated camera, the Zeiss Ikon Contarex Hologon in the late 1960s; as sales of that camera were poor and the Zeiss Ikon company itself was going bankrupt, an additional 225 lenses were made in Leica M mount and released for sale in 1972 as the only Zeiss-branded lenses for Leica rangefinders until the ZM line was released in 2005. The Hologon name was revived in 1994 for a recomputed f=16mm 8 lens fitted to the Contax G series of rangefinder cameras. Design The Hologon was designed by and others at Zeiss in 1966 and patented in 1972. It is a largely symmetric triplet with a fixed aperture; the original German patent application describes a lens with 120¬∞ angle of coverage and a 8 maximum aperture, while the US patent expands this to three related designs with different coverage angles and apertures (120¬∞ 8, 110¬∞ 5.6, and 90¬∞ 8). In each design, the first and third hemispherical elements are made of optical glass with the same refractive index. At least one prototype Hologon was built in 1964 or 1965 as a large-format lens with a focal length of 110 mm. It has been shown via radiograph the large format Hologon 8/110mm uses a leaf shutter between the second and third elements, with adjustments to the first and third elements to accommodate it. The prototype Hologon, internally known as the Bilagon, was sold at auction in 2010 for . The name \\"Hologon\\" is derived from the Greek words holos, meaning \\"everything\\" or \\"complete\\", and gonia, meaning \\"angle\\"; gonia contributed the final syllable -gon, which had been used in preceding Zeiss wide-angle lens designs such as the Zeiss Distagon and Biogon. As built, the symmetrical design for the Hologon 8/15mm by Glatzel provided excellent correction of coma, spherical and chromatic aberration, astigmatism, and curvature of field; the main fault was vignetting due to the cos4 law, which was corrected by supplying a graduated neutral density filter to make the exposure more even across the film frame. Although the lens consists of only three elements, manufacturing proved difficult. =Contarex Hologon ultra wide= The original Hologon (Contarex Hologon 8/15mm) was first released in 1969 as a f=15 mm 8 lens affixed to a dedicated camera, the Zeiss Ikon Contarex Hologon. In this version, the lens is fixed focus and aperture; the size of the aperture is set by the incised notch in the second element. Depth of field ranged from to infinity. A bubble level is fitted to the top of the (non-reflex) viewfinder. Typically, a pistol grip is affixed to the Hologon camera to avoid inadvertently taking pictures of the photographer's fingers. Approximately 1,400 Contarex Hologon cameras were made; production continued through 1975 in small batches. In 1971, the list price for the Hologon was , marked up from the wholesale cost of . =M Hologon 8/15mm= Hologon T* 16mm 8 for Contax G, with finder, graduated filter, and case The Contarex Hologon 8/15mm lens was later released as part of a set including a finder (with bubble level) and center graduated neutral density filter for Leica M cameras in 1972 (M Hologon 8/15mm). Estimates of production for the M Hologon 8/15mm range from 225 to 1,000. The M Hologon 8/15mm gained a focusing helicoid compared to the Contarex Hologon 8/15mm, and could now be focused down to . Because of the low production numbers and unique focal length, some lenses have been separated from the Contarex Hologon and adapted to Leica mount. =G Hologon 8/16mm= Revised G Hologon 8/16mm layout The G Hologon 8/16mm was announced with the Contax G1 in 1994; the revised G Hologon 8/16mm retained the name from the earlier Contarex and M Hologon 8/15mm, but the construction was completely different, using 5 elements in 3 groups. Zeiss claimed that contrast had been improved by moving the rear element closer to the film plane. The new G Hologon 8/16mm was also provided with a graduated filter to provide a more even exposure. The revised construction of the G Hologon 8/16mm also simplified assembly of the lens, as the cemented groups were easier to manufacture than the hemispherical front and rear elements of the Contarex and M Hologon 8/15mm. Although nominally listed as a 16 mm lens, the focal length of the G Hologon 8/16mm is actually 16.5 mm and it provides coverage of 106¬∞ on the frame diagonal. The G Hologon 8/16mm was the only lens for the Contax G that was manufactured in Germany. Like the earlier Contarex 8/15mm Hologon, the G Hologon 8/16mm also has been adapted unofficially to Leica M mount. ReferencesExternal links * Includes MTF chart for Hologon 8/15mm.

Early life and education  Pamela Schwerdt was born on 5 April 1931 in Surrey, the granddaughter of Edith Vere Dent, who founded the Wild Flower Society in 1886, and the daughter of Violet Schwerdt MBE, who was subsequently editor of the society newsletter following on from her mother and sister. From 1936 the family lived in Newfoundland then Nova Scotia, returning to England in 1945, where Pam attended Lady Eleanor Holles School in Hampton, Middlesex. In 1951, aged 18, she joined Waterperry School of Horticulture for Ladies, at Waterperry Gardens in Oxfordshire. She was attracted by the fact that the clothes list included \\"two pairs of gumboots and a mackintosh\\" rather than the \\"cap and gown\\" required at Wye College, and this reflected the practical nature of the training offered by the school's founder, Beatrix Havergal. Whilst there she formed a close friendship with Sibylle Kreutzberger, a fellow student, with whom she was to work for the rest of her life. She passed the Waterperry diploma and was also awarded the Chittenden Prize for achieving the highest marks in the Royal Horticultural Society's National Diploma of Horticulture. She stayed on the teaching staff after the course, remaining for eight years in total.  Career  By 1959 both Schwerdt and Kreutzberger felt Waterperry was \\"like being at school forever\\". Schwerdt contacted various gardening correspondents, including Vita Sackville-West, in search of a walled garden to start a nursery. Sackville-West said she did not know of a site but subsequently wrote to say she needed a head gardener for the garden she had created at Sissinghurst Castle: would Pam be interested? Schwerdt replied \\"yes, but we are two\\". From 1959 until retirement in 1990 she was the joint head gardener, with Kreutzberger, at the garden at Sissinghurst Castle in Kent. Kreutzberger focused on propagation, and Schwerdt had a higher public profile, although they were often seen and addressed as a pair. \\"Women were rare in horticulture in those days\\", recalled Kreutzberger in 2006. \\"When we first went to Sissinghurst, people used to point at us as though we were baboons at the zoo.\\" She served on several RHS committees, including the Floral A Committee (now Herbaceous Committee) for 32 years 1977‚Äì2008 and the Floral Trials Subcommittee (now Floral Trials Assessment Panel) for 30 years 1979‚Äì2009, both latterly as vice chair, and she was often a judge at RHS shows. She was made an associate of honour of the Royal Horticultural Society in 1980 and received the Victoria Medal of Honour in 2006, at the same time as Kreutzberger. She was appointed MBE in 1990. In 1992 she received, with Kreutzberger, the third International Carlo Scarpa Prize for Gardens awarded by the Fondazione Benetton. In 1991 the two women bought a house together at Manor Farm, Condicote, near Stow-on-the-Wold in Gloucestershire, where they made a garden that was much admired. Schwerdt died on 11 September 2009 at the age of 78, from a lung cancer caused by asbestos exposure, although the coroner could not determine where this came from. She never married.  Horticultural innovation and influence  The widely copied \\"Sissinghurst look\\", owed as much, if not more, to Schwerdt and Kreuzberger as to Sackville- West (who died in 1962, only 3 years after the new head gardeners joined). \\"It's as much their garden as Vita's,\\" said Alexis Datta, head gardener in 2010. Signature characteristics were planting a profusion of flowers in colourful tonal displays, dense rose beds, the use of topiary and trellises to give sculptural shapes, and selective wildness. Partly by using annuals and tender perennials, they were able to make planting that Sackville-West considered to be over by mid July, last into autumn. This way of extending the season was copied in other gardens owned by the National Trust, and by home gardeners. During her tenure, visiting figures rose from about 6,000 a year in 1959 to 197,000 in 1991 (the year after she retired). She was passionate about the need for close observance of plants, which she described as \\"living with plants\\". She gave lectures, in the UK (including on the English Garden School's Plant and Plantsmanship course for eight years) and USA, although in general shunned publicity, saying \\"Gardening doesn't need celebrities, it's a celebrity in itself\\". Their work was documented in various books, including \\"Gardening at Sissinghurst\\" by Tony Lord () and \\"Sissinghurst: Portrait of a Garden\\" by Jane Brown ().

Founded in 1907, its products are sold in retail outlets as well as to foodservice and manufacturing customers. thumb Company history The company was founded in 1907 by Otis Kline and Richard Massey. Headquartered in Sterling, Illinois, it was then called Massey's and was focused on the production of fragrances for cleaning products. In 1917, the company moved to Webster Avenue in Chicago to be closer to a transportation hub., and Chatfield Nielsen Sr. joined the company's leadership. Nielsen and Massey worked together to focus the company on manufacturing a variety of vanillas and other flavors, primarily for sale to food manufacturers. In 1954, upon the passing of Richard Massey, Nielsen purchased the company from the Massey family. His son Chatfield Jr. (Chat) joined the company in 1958 and ultimately become vice president in 1963. This same year, the company was renamed Nielsen-Massey. Chat later succeeded his father as president and focused on making Nielsen-Massey ‚Äúpure vanilla specialists‚Äù‚Äî producing only all-natural vanilla products. In 1979, Chat's wife Camilla joined the company's leadership team. Until the early 1980s, Nielsen-Massey only sold its products to industrial and foodservice customers. But in 1980, they were contacted by a then-unknown Chuck Williams, who wanted to place an order for 20,000 bottles of vanilla extract to sell at his retail store ‚Äì then just a hardware store in Sonoma, California that also sold French cookware. That initial order led Nielsen-Massey to create a retail product line, bottling 8 oz. packages exclusively for Williams Sonoma, and Nielsen- Massey has continued to be sold in its stores, catalogs, and website ever since. In 1984 the company moved out of downtown Chicago, relocating its production to suburban Lake Forest, Illinois, and then later moving to Waukegan in 1992 in order to increase plant size and expand production. After Chat's passing in 1992, Camilla took over company leadership. The third generation of the Nielsen family started joining the company in 1986, with the addition of Chat and Camilla's oldest son Craig, followed by younger son Matt in 1994. In 2006, their daughter Beth also joined the company. The company expanded in the 1990s, first with the plant move to Waukegan, then with the opening of Nielsen-Massey Vanillas International, LLC in Leeuwarden, Netherlands in 1995. They also developed new vanilla products beyond just traditional extract, starting with Madagascar Bourbon Pure Vanilla Powder in 1995, then with Madagascar Bourbon Pure Vanilla Bean Paste in 1998. In 2005 the company introduced a line of flavor extracts, including almond, chocolate, coffee, orange, and peppermint. Also in 2005, Camilla Nielsen retired from Nielsen-Massey (although she remained chairman of the board until 2016), and her children Craig, Matt, and later Beth took on leadership of the company. In 2017 the company established an outside board of directors and Kirk Trofholz became CEO. In 2018, it announced No Sugar Added Vanilla Extract and an organic line of flavor extracts Leadership In 2017, the company brought in an outside CEO, Kirk Trofholz, for the first time. Craig Nielsen, currently Vice President of Sustainability, is frequently interviewed about vanilla sourcing in the major growing regions, and also educates culinary students on the difference between vanilla varietals. Beth Nielsen, who serves as Chief Culinary Officer, has expertise on the use of vanilla in various food applications. Matt Nielsen, currently Vice President of Strategic Initiatives, was from 2008-2018 a director and officer of the Specialty Food Association, a food industry body.

US-Japan Women's Journal, 44, 1, 2013, p√†g. 13. DOI: 10.1353/jwj.2013.0009.  Reign  Iyo is not cited in many historical records, and her origin is unknown. The only recorded reliable claims are that Iyo was a close relative of Himiko, and that she acquired great political power at a very young age. Information obtained from Chinese sources and from archeological and ethnological discoveries has led Japanese scholars to conclude that Iyo was Himiko's niece. Himiko and Iyo were female shamans and that sovereignty had both a political and a religious character. After Himiko's death, a man took power in Yamatai as regent. However, warfare soon engulfed the polity. The ruling council met and decided to put another woman on the throne. The one chosen was Iyo, a girl of only 13 years old, who succeeded in reinstating peace in her government following the same political line adopted by Queen Himiko. In the \\"Records of Wei\\", one of Asia's most important historiographies, describes Himiko's death and Iyo's rise, saying: > When Himiko passed away, a great mound was raised, more than a hundred paces > in diameter. Over a hundred male and female attendants followed her to the > grave. Then a king was placed on the throne, but the people would not obey > him.

The family are introduced as a central family unit consisting of father Charlie Slater (Derek Martin), grandmother Mo Harris (Laila Morse), Charlie's daughters, Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace), Lynne Slater (Elaine Lordan), Little Mo Morgan (Kacey Ainsworth) and Zoe Slater (Michelle Ryan), and Lynne's partner Garry Hobbs (Ricky Groves). A fifth sister, Belinda Peacock (Leanne Lakey), was introduced a year later. The family were the eighth to be introduced in the soap's history, replacing the di Marco family who departed during the previous month. The Slaters were created by Tony Jordan and introduced by John Yorke. The Slater sisters were cast in an improvisation session. In their first years on the show, the family were involved in storylines about child sexual abuse and domestic violence. Following multiple cast departures, three new cast members ‚Äî Lacey Turner (Stacey Slater), Gillian Wright (Jean Slater) and Rob Kazinsky (Sean Slater) ‚Äî joined the show as an extension of the family. Stacey and Jean were used to highlight the topic of bipolar disorder, working with the charity Mind. In 2010, Turner left the series and Wallace reprised her role; the following year, Kat featured in a controversial story which sees her son swapped for a deceased baby. Turner returned in 2014 and the Slater family were later expanded. Riley Carter Millington, the first transgender actor to portray a transgender character in a British soap opera, was cast as Stacey's half-brother, Kyle Slater. Denise Welch appeared in one episode as Kyle's mother, Alison Slater. The family became a focal point across New Year 2016 when Kat discovers that she has a secret son and Charlie is killed off. The events are followed by a spin-off drama, Kat & Alfie: Redwater, focusing on Kat's search for her son, who is revealed to be murderous Catholic priest Dermott Dolan (Ois√≠n Stack). 2016 also sees Stacey begin suffering from postpartum psychosis, a rare mental illness associated with bipolar mothers. Prior to the storyline, the family were merged with the Fowler family following Stacey's pairing with Martin Fowler (James Bye). Following his reappointment, Yorke revived the Slater family by reintroducing Kat, Jean and Mo, and casting Katie Jarvis as new family member Hayley Slater. The Slater family once again became a focal point across Christmas 2018, when the paternity of Hayley‚Äôs baby is revealed.  Creation  On 30 August 2000, it was announced that a new family, the Slaters, would be introduced to EastEnders to replace the di Marco family, who departed the series during that month. The family, who first appear in September, mark the eighth to be introduced in the soap's history. Executive producer John Yorke hoped that the introduction of the family would return EastEnders to its familial roots, describing them as \\"the classic EastEnders family which is all about surviving and fighting back all the time.\\" Head of BBC drama series, Mal Young, said the family were introduced as at the time, the serial had a deficit of \\"solid families\\", expanding, \\"there were a lot of fractured families and people who were alone.\\" The Slater family was created by series consultant Tony Jordan during an improvisation session with 30 actors and actresses. Prior to the workshop session, Yorke assumed he would create a more traditionally structured family, consisting of a mother, a father and two children. He was surprised to find that the presiding influence over the Slaters as they were created was a dead matriarch, Viv Slater (Debi Gibson), who exerted a \\"powerful influence\\" from beyond the grave. Yorke selected Jessie Wallace (Kat Slater), Elaine Lordan (Lynne Slater), Kacey Ainsworth (Little Mo Morgan) and Michelle Ryan (Zoe Slater) to play four of the Slater sisters as they got along so well during the improvisation session. Derek Martin was cast as patriarch Charlie Slater later than his screen daughters, in his third audition for EastEnders, having previously been considered for the roles of Den Watts and Frank Butcher. Laila Morse was chosen to portray Charlie's mother-in-law, Mo Harris. Leanne Lakey was later cast as the fifth daughter, Belinda Peacock, a recurring character introduced in 2001. Lakey enjoyed portraying Belinda on a recurring basis due to her second role on Family Affairs.  Development  Upon the introduction of Charlie's brother Harry Slater (Michael Elphick) in 2001, it transpired that Zoe was actually Kat's daughter, conceived as a product of rape following her molestation by her uncle. Both Harry and Little Mo's abusive husband Trevor Morgan (Alex Ferns), introduced in December 2000, were outsiders to the core family unit, never given a permanent home on Albert Square. Yorke felt that this was an important distinction to make, as when the possibility of a child sexual abuse storyline was discussed, it was concluded that the audience would feel \\"betrayed\\" were such a revelation to be made about a long-established and well-liked character. Both characters were also easily removed from the family, with Trevor dying in a fire, and Harry exiled to Spain where he died from a heart attack. = Departures and introductions = Actress Michelle Ryan (pictured in 2009) departed her role as Zoe Slater in 2005. Between July 2004 and May 2006, each original Slater sister departed the series. Lynne became the first original Slater character to leave the series after executive producer Louise Berridge decided not to renew Lordon's contract. Lynne departs after ending her marriage to Garry. After becoming pregnant in 2004, Wallace was confirmed to be taking maternity leave from the show. Despite this plans for Kat to leave in December, the actress stopped filming in August following a pregnancy scare. After a short absence, Wallace returned to filming in January and Kat reappeared in May. Shortly afterwards, Zoe made her final appearance following Ryan's decision to leave the series. Ryan filmed her final scenes in May and Zoe departs after deciding to move to Ibiza. On 19 July 2005, it was announced that Wallace had decided to leave EastEnders. Richie had announced his intentions to leave two days previously, and the characters depart together on Christmas Day. The final Slater sister actress, Ainsworth, announced her plans to leave the show to pursue new projects in April 2006. Her character, Little Mo, departed during the following month when she moves to Barnstaple. Little Mo's son Freddie Mitchell, portrayed by twins Alex and Tom Kilby, was also written out of the series. Following the spree of exits in the family, producers created three new additions of the family. Lacey Turner was cast as Stacey Slater, Charlie's \\"fiesty\\" great-niece, who is billed as \\"one hell of a bitch\\". Turner originally auditioned for a part in the Miller family. Stacey's mother, Jean Slater (Gillian Wright), was later introduced as a minor character. Following a short stint in 2005, the character was gradually developed into a main character, a process which Wright found difficult as she struggled \\"to turn her from someone who was quite an intensive character to someone who could be watched on a regular basis.\\" The topic of bipolar disorder is explored through Jean, who suffers from the condition. Wright spoke to a bipolar sufferer regularly to make her portrayal accurate. Robert Kazinsky was cast as Stacey's brother, Sean Slater, in 2006 and the character first appears in August. A show spokesperson stated that Sean would feature in \\"some of the biggest storylines of the year\\". It is revealed that Sean feels responsible for the death of his father, Brian, who died of an aneurysm the day after Sean punched him. Kazinsky continued in the role until 2009 after deciding to explore new projects. Writers paired Stacey with Bradley Branning (Charlie Clements) in 2006 and they married during the following year. Stacey subsequently became more integrated in the Branning family unit. Stacey embarks on a \\"dramatic\\" affair with Bradley's father, Max Branning (Jake Wood). The affair is revealed to their family on Christmas Day through a DVD made by Max's daughter, Lauren Branning (Madeline Duggan), and Bradley ends their marriage. In 2009, Stacey was used to highlight the issue of bipolar disorder, a storyline which was created as part of the BBC's Headroom campaign tackling mental health awareness. By the point of Stacey being diagnosed, Jean's condition was being portrayed as a characteristic rather than a storyline. EastEnders worked with mental health charities, including Mind, to portray Stacey's bipolar disorder. Stacey is later sectioned after Bradley decides to move to Canada with his girlfriend, Syd Chambers (Nina Toussaint-White). When Bradley returns, the couple reunite. Clements enjoyed working with Turner and opined that they had good chemistry on-screen. Stacey became pregnant in 2009 and gave birth to a daughter, Lily Branning, in June 2010. Stacey and Bradley had remarried four months previously. = Cast exits, Kat's return and baby swap = Ronnie Branning, portrayed by Samantha Womack (pictured), swapped her dead baby with Kat's son, Tommy, in late 2010. To celebrate the soap's 25th anniversary, producers created a storyline, \\"Who Killed Archie?\\", to kill off Archie Mitchell (Larry Lamb). The story builds to a revelation in a live episode broadcast on 19 February 2010. Stacey was central to the storyline and was revealed to be Archie's killer in the live episode, which also features Bradley's death. Days later, Turner and Wood (Max Branning) feature in a two-hander episode written by series consultant and lead writer Simon Ashdown. Following his appointment in 2010, executive producer Bryan Kirkwood opted to write out multiple characters from the series, including Charlie. Kirkwood originally planned for Charlie to be killed-off when he suffers a heartattack, but after Martin spoke to Yorke, the then-head of drama, plans were changed to allow Charlie to leave alive. On 29 April 2010, it was announced that Turner and Wright would be leaving the series in \\"dramatic departures\\". At the time of her departure, Kirkwood called Turner \\"one of the best young actresses on TV\\" and wished her luck for the future. He also praised Wright, commenting, \\"Gillian has brought real heart and pathos to the role of Jean Slater\\". It was later confirmed that Wright had been handed a reprieve and Jean would return shortly after her exit. Stacey escapes to Mexico with Lily on Christmas Day 2010 after confessing to Archie's murder. Weeks later, Jean leaves after being sectioned, but she returns in March. In February 2010, it was announced that Wallace and Richie would return to EastEnders later that year. The actors returned to the screen in September 2010https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and- radio/tvandradioblog/2010/sep/21/eastenders-alfie-moon-kat-slater and were the first cast members to be signed by Kirkwood following his appointment. It was confirmed that Kat and Alfie would be become the landlord and landlady of The Queen Victoria pub, a pivotal location in the series, when it reopens following a fire. Kat and Alfie return in September 2010, where she is revealed to be pregnant. Following their return, Richie teased that the characters would feature in a 1-2 year-long storyline which he described as \\"the biggest soap story in probably the history of soaps\\". In late December 2010, Kat gives birth to a son, Tommy Moon (Shane and Ralfie White). The birth forms a new story for the family when Ronnie Mitchell (Samantha Womack) swaps her dead baby with Tommy. Kirkwood billed the storyline as \\"convincing and powerful\\" and \\"built on the rich history\\" of Kat and Ronnie. The Foundation for the Study of Infant Deaths praised the storyline for accurately portraying how sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) can affect families. The plot leads to Charlie's exit in January 2011. That same month, it was confirmed that the storyline would end early due to heavy criticism. The storyline concluded in April when Kat and Alfie are reunited with Tommy. Wallace thought that it would tough for the couple, particularly Kat, following their reunion with Tommy. Following the conclusion, Martin reprised his role for two episodes. Charlie returns and fixes his relationship with Kat, as well as helping her bond with Tommy. = Stacey's return and secret family = In July 2012, Morse was told that her contract would not be renewed, however she continued to make occasional appearances in the show. On 31 July 2013, it was announced that Jean would leave EastEnders following Wright's resignation. The actress hoped to reprise the role in the future. As part of Jean's exit, Tony O'Callaghan was cast as her new love interest, Ollie Walters. The characters depart together in September 2013 after deciding to move to Brighton. Martin reprised his role as Charlie for two episodes in December 2013 and expressed an interest in returning permanently. That same month, Kat announces that she is pregnant with Alfie's child. Nine months later, Kat gives birth to their twin sons, Bert and Ernie Moon (Freddie and Stanley Beale). Actress Lacey Turner reprised her role as Stacey Slater in 2014, four years after she quit the show. It was announced on 6 December 2013 that Turner had agreed to reprise her role as Stacey and that the character would return in early 2014. Executive producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins described Stacey as \\"one of EastEnders best-loved characters, played by one of television's finest actors\\". He also commented, \\"Stacey's last time on the Square was iconic. But that was just the first act. There is so much more to come for Stacey.\\" Matt Willis was cast as Stacey's partner Luke Riley and appeared across a guest stint. Lily was reintroduced alongside Stacey with the role recast to child actress Aine Garvey. Stacey and Lily return in February 2014, but Stacey departs during the following month after confessing to Archie's murder. Off- screen, Turner took a planned break to film BBC drama Our Girl. In May 2014, it was announced that Wright would film a guest stint to coincide with Stacey's return from her break. Treadwell-Collins confirmed that Stacey and Jean's relationship and bipolar disorder would be explored in upsetting scenes. Stacey and Jean returned in August. A second return for Jean was confirmed in May 2015 when it was teased that Jean and Ollie would marry, and Jean appears two months later in July. Following her return, Stacey was shown to own a mystery key, starting a long-running storyline for the Slater family. In October 2015, it was announced that Riley Carter Millington had been cast as Kyle, a new character for the show. Millington's casting marked the first time a transgender actor has played the role of a transgender character in a British soap opera. Kyle is shown to have a key similar to Stacey in his first appearance. Jean made another guest return in December for the reveal of Stacey's key. At the time of the reveal, the story was described by Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy as \\"one of the longest-running mysteries in EastEnders history\\". During Jean's return, it emerges that Stacey's father and Jean's husband, Brian, was a bigamist and had a second family. Kyle was later confirmed to be Stacey's half-brother. In May 2016, accredited actress Denise Welch appeared in one episode of the soap, episode 5276, as Kyle's mother Alison Slater, who has not seen him since his transition. = Kat's secret son and Charlie's death = On 3 April 2015, it was announced that Kat, Alfie and their children would be written out of the series to appear in a spin-off series centering around the characters. The spin-off contains six episodes and was announced to air in 2016. Treadwell-Collins created the drama and looked forward to developing the series. He explained that he wanted to \\"take two of EastEnders most beloved and enduring characters out of their comfort zone\\". The controller of BBC One, Charlotte Moore, said about Kat and Alfie's new story, \\"Rest assured, their rollercoaster isn't set to end any time soon.\\" Wallace and Richie were delighted to be handed the series, with Wallace excited to \\"[explore] the next chapter for Kat\\". It was confirmed that the series would follow a new storyline established in the EastEnders. The storyline was revealed in May when it emerges that Kat unknowingly gave birth to a secret son: the twin brother of Zoe. Later in the month, the family leave the series after winning ¬£1 million on a scratch card. Family patriarch Charlie Slater, portrayed by Derek Martin (pictured), was killed off in January 2016. In October 2015, it was announced that Kat, Alfie and their children would make a short return between December 2015 and January 2016. The guest stint leads towards the family's spin-off series and explores the Kat's secret son story as Kat discovers the truth. Treadwell-Collins teased that the return would \\"lead to tears, laughter and a mountain of secrets being unearthed for the Slater family\\". He said that the guest stint would make Kat realise that she needs to visit Ireland. It was later confirmed that Martin would reprise his role as Charlie for a guest appearance during Kat's return. Martin looked forward to filming with the Slater family again and stated that he would return as part of \\"a big and important storyline\\". Treadwell-Collins decided to kill off the character of Charlie during his guest stint. He promised Martin \\"a good send off\\" for the character, which the actor was pleased with. During the guest stint, Kat is told about her secret son and the tension in the family leads to Charlie's sudden death. Following Charlie's death, Belinda was reintroduced for a guest stint. Carli Norris took over the role and appeared in multiple episodes in January. Morse also departed following the Martin's exit. Following her exit, Morse criticised her departure and confirmed that she had never received an official departure, \\"leaving party or a present\\". It was confirmed in August 2016 that the spin- off series would be titled Redwater, although this was later changed to Kat & Alfie: Redwater. Having originally been scheduled to air in 2016, Kat & Alfie: Redwater was delayed due to unconfirmed reasons. Filming took place in Ireland between April and July 2016. The drama is broadcast across six hour-long episodes between May and June 2017. The only characters from EastEnders to feature in the series are Kat (credited as Kathleen), Alfie and Tommy. Treadwell-Collins, who created the series, explained that the decision was made not to include Bert and Ernie as he believed that Kat and Alfie would be restricted by their appearance. The role of Tommy was recast for the drama with child actor Henry Proctor taking over the role. The first episode of the series sees Kat's son revealed to be murderous Catholic priest Dermott Dolan (Ois√≠n Stack). The series ends on a cliffhanger as it is not known whether Kat and Alfie are alive or dead. Treadwell-Collins described the ending as \\"the mother of all cliffhangers\\". On 20 September 2017, it was announced that Kat & Alfie: Redwater would not return for a second series. = Merge with the Fowlers = The Slaters are merged with the Fowler family following Stacey's pairing with Martin Fowler (James Bye, pictured). Producers paired Stacey with Martin Fowler (James Bye) in 2015 and they shared an on-off relationship. It was confirmed in May 2015 that Stacey would have sex with Martin's best friend, Kush Kazemi (Davood Ghadami), who is also Stacey's best friend's partner. The following month, it was reported that Stacey would fall pregnant, sparking a \\"who's the daddy\\" storyline with either Martin or Kush as potential fathers. Part of the storyline sees Stacey stop taking her bipolar medication. Kush was later confirmed to be the father of Stacey's baby. In December 2015, it was announced that Stacey would be diagnosed with rare mental illness postpartum psychosis, a condition associated with mothers with bipolar disorder, after she gives birth across the Christmas period. EastEnders spoke with charities and women suffering from the condition to portray the story accurately. Treadwell-Collins confirmed that the story would continue into 2016 and would focus on the effects it has on Stacey and her family and friends. Stacey gives birth on Christmas Eve and she and Martin name the baby Arthur Fowler after Martin's father. In January 2016, Martin discovers that he is not Arthur's father after being handed a letter written by Stacey while she recovers from her psychosis. They later reunite and Martin proposes to Stacey as she continues her recovery at the mother and baby unit. As Stacey recovers, Belinda returns in April to support her. Norris joined the show's regular cast and in May, it was announced that Gary Webster had been cast as Belinda's \\"successful, middle-class\\" husband, Neville Peacock. Belinda decides to move to Albert Square, but Neville disagrees and they split. Stacey and Martin marry during May 2016, establishing Stacey as a member of the Slater family and creating a new generation of the Fowler family. The wedding takes place during a week of episodes centering around the death of Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor). Following executive producer Sean O'Connor's hiring, multiple characters were written out of the soap. O'Connor decided not to renew the contracts of Millington and Norris. Belinda departs in November after deciding to travel with a friend, while Kyle departs later in the month after accepting a job in France. On his departure, Millington said that Kyle's time on the show had come to a \\"natural end\\". Both actors expressed an interest in returning to the soap. Stacey becomes pregnant again in 2017 with Martin's child. In the build-up to giving birth, Stacey has a seizure and is diagnosed with pre-eclampsia, which brings potential harm to her and the baby. She gives birth to a daughter, Hope Fowler, in October. The birth of Hope establishes the new generation of the Fowler family with Stacey as the matriarch. On Stacey and Martin's relationship and the family, Turner told David Brown of the Radio Times, \\"They're a real team and no matter what happens they always seem to come out the other end stronger than ever. She puts her trust in Martin to make everything better.\\" = Revival of the family = On 20 December 2017, it was confirmed that Wallace, Wright and Morse would reprise their roles as Kat, Jean and Mo respectively. All three actresses expressed their delight at returning to the soap. Yorke also expressed his excitement at the family's revival and said that it was \\"a real joy to find a way to bring them back together\\". Upon her return, Wallace opined that Yorke had revisited the family aspect of EastEnders and the Slater family. On Yorke's creative choices with the family, Wallace commented, \\"There's the hustle and bustle of the Slaters, supporting each other, arguing with each other, laughing, it's just great.\\" Mo returns in March 2018 and announces that Kat is dead, leading the residents of Albert Square to arrange a fundraising night in memory of Kat. Shortly after Mo, Jean returns followed by Kat. Yorke also confirmed a new Slater family member would be introduced to the series. Katie Jarvis later joined the cast as Stacey's cousin, Hayley Slater. The actress expressed her disbelief at joining a family that she loves. In May, it emerges that Hayley is pregnant and when Alfie appears in two episodes, he is revealed to be the father. In September 2018, it was announced that Ashley McGuire has been cast in the role of Hayley's mother, Bev Slater. She appears across multiple guest stints.Sources: The following month, Hayley gives birth to a daughter, Cherry Slater. Following Alfie's return in November, Tommy, Bert and Ernie were reintroduced to the series. Shay Crotty reprised his role as Tommy, while the roles of Bert and Ernie were recast to Elliot Briffett and Cody Briffett respectively. The family are central to the 2018 Christmas episodes as the truth about Cherry's paternity is revealed.  Family members  Carli Norris (pictured) portrayed Belinda Peacock in 2016.

The podcast special builds towards the 2018 Christmas episodes.  Reception  In December 2003, a BBC spokesperson called the Slaters \\"arguably the most successful family in soap\\". On the family, Jess Wilson, writing for OK!, commented, \\"The Slater sisters were among one of the most popular families to join EastEnders in recent times, and they certainly wasted no time making themselves known on the Square.\\" Her colleague, Laura Donaldson, described the Slater family as \\"one of the most iconic families\\" in the soap. She added that the family have been at the centre of \\"the show's most dramatic and shocking moments\\". Reflecting on the family in December 2017, Yorke commented, \\"The Slaters are one of the all-time great families in EastEnders and Albert Square has never felt quite the same since they scattered to different ends of the country, and in some cases beyond.\\"  References  External links  *Slater family at BBC Online EastEnders families Television characters introduced in 2000 Soap opera families ","title":"Slater family (EastEnders)"},{"id":"59068794","text":"Krounchasana, Heron pose (with hands in a mudra) Krau√±cƒÅsana (Sanskrit: ‡§ï‡•ç‡§∞‡•å‡§û‡•ç‡§ö‡§æ‡§∏‡§®) or Heron pose, also written Krounchasana, is a sitting asana in modern yoga as exercise. Etymology and origins The name comes from the Sanskrit words Kraunch (‡§ï‡•ç‡§∞‡•å‡§û‡•ç‡§ö) meaning \\"heron\\", and the name of a mountain; and Asana (‡§Ü‡§∏‡§®, ƒÅsana) meaning \\"posture\\" or \\"seat\\". Kraunch is also stated to mean the demoiselle crane or the curlew, both like the heron being long-legged waterbirds. The 19th century Sritattvanidhi uses the name for a different pose, squatting, supported by a rope held with the teeth. The modern pose is described in 20th century manuals such as B. K. S. Iyengar's Light on Yoga. Swami Yogesvarananda names the modern pose \\"Ekapadotthitahastapadaprasaranasana\\" in his 1970 First Steps to Higher yoga, reserving the name Kraunchasana for a preparatory phase of another pose named for a waterbird, Bakasana (the Crane). Pattabhi Jois uses the name for the same pose as Iyengar, implying, according to the yoga scholar Norman Sjoman, that they both learnt the pose from their teacher Krishnamacharya. Description The pose is sitting with one knee forwards on the ground and the foot beside the hip, as in Virasana, the other leg straight and raised to touch the nose and chin, the foot grasped by both hands. It provides a stronger forward bend than Paschimottanasana. The posture is stated to be unsuitable during menstruation.

She was, according to traditional legend, ruler for a short period between Emperor Seinei and Emperor Kenz≈ç. She was baptized as Empress Tsunuzashi in the list of emperors of Japan, written by Ernest Mason Satow.Ernest Mason Satow: Japanese Chronological Tables (et al.), reprint of the Yedo 1874 edition, Bristol: Ganesha 1998.  Descent  Princess Iitoyo, like the reigning Emperor Kenz≈ç (Prince Woke ; ruled 485‚Äì487) and Ninken (Prince Ohoke ; ruled 488‚Äì498) are said to be descended from the 17th Emperor Rich≈´ (ruled 400‚Äì405). The exact degree of this relationship is shown differently in the earliest chronicles from the 8th century : After the Kojiki of 712, Iitoyo was the younger sister of the imperial prince Ichinobe no Oshiwa and thus the daughter of Emperor Rich≈´ and aunt of the princes Ohoke and Woke. Tomb of Iitoyo. In turn, according to the Nihon Shoki of 720, Iitoyo was the daughter of the prince and his wife Hayehime, making her the sister of Ohoke and Woke and, like the two, a Emperor Rich≈´ grandchild.  Regency  According to the chronicles mentioned, after the death of the 20th Emperor Ank≈ç (presumably ruled 453‚Äì456), his brother murdered all rivals who could claim the throne, and then as the 21st Emperor Y≈´ryaku (presumably ruled 456‚Äì479) to rule. This included above all his cousin Prince Ichinobe no Oshiwa, who was the eldest son of Emperor Rich≈´ whose crown prince. While we learn that his sons Ohoke and Woke fled to the province after his murder, there is no information about their aunt/sister Iitoyo during this time. It appears in the chronicles for the first time in the depictions of the 22nd Emperor Seinei (presumably ruled 479‚Äì484), the son and successor of Emperor Y≈´ryaku. This had no children and otherwise no close relatives, which is why a suitable heir to the throne from the lineage of the sun goddess Amaterasu was sought. According to the Kojiki, this search only began after the death of Emperor Seinei and ended with the discovery of Princess Iitoyo at the Tsunusashi Palace, in Oshinumi, in Kazuragi. She then appears to have taken over as Wodate, the governor of Harima province , sent a message to the capital after his discovery of princes Ohoke and Woke. Iitoyo then gave the order to bring her nephews to her in the palace, where she presumably handed the rule over to her. The course of these events is presented somewhat differently in the Nihon Shoki. The princes are found here before the death of Emperor Seinei, so that he can elevate the older Ohoke himself to the crown prince and Woke to the imperial prince. Iitoyo is briefly mentioned here for the first time. Meaning it gains only in the narrative of Emperor Kenzo, when the prince after the death of Seinei can not agree on a successor, since everyone wanted to leave the other to the throne. In the resulting interregnum, Iitoyo took over the reign and ruled the country from the Tsunuzashi Palace in Oshinomi. She gave herself the title Oshinomi no Ihitoyo no Awo no Mikoto, After eleven months in the winter of the same year, she died and was buried in a burial site (misasagi) on Mount Haniguchi in Katsuraki.  Reception  After Empress Jing≈´, Princess Iitoyo is the second woman described in the chronicles, who was in government for a while. But just like this, she is generally not recognized as a ruling empress by historians and she does not appear in the official Japanese Emperor lists.In the 1219 written by the Buddhist monk Jien Japanese historical work Gukansh≈ç found to Iitoyo as reigning empress following explanation: > \\"Since the two brothers were adamant to let the other go first, in the > second month of the year in which Seine died, their young sister, Seine, > succeeded the throne as ruling empress. But she herself died at 12 months > [Note .: elsewhere 11 months ] of the same year.

Iitoyo's entry as Empress Tsunuzashi in the Tenn≈ç list (Emperor list) by Ernest Mason Satow, Japanese Chronological Tables, 1874. Even after Isaac Titsingh's translation of Nihon ≈ådai Ichiran , which was written in 1625, Iitoyo was not counted among the official tenn≈ç because she had ruled for less than ten months, but she had been given a posthumous Empress name after her death (Japanese: È£Ø Ë±ä Â§©Áöá Empress Iitoyo). Iitoyo is also under other posthumous Empress name (Okurina) such as Empress Pagei and Empress Tsunuzachi also recognized as a sovereign empress on various occasions, for which information can also be found in the Nihon Shoki, if there is the term for her death b≈ç is used, which is otherwise reserved exclusively for Emperors. Historians have a variety of theories about their reign: Iitoyo, according to one, may be identical to Queen Taiyoo, a successor to Himiko under the rule of Yamatai. The historian Shinobu Orikuchi sees her as the first ruling empress in the history of Japan, who combines the roles of the shaman and the sovereign. Mitak≈ç Mihoo, on the other hand, believes that Iitoyo was a rival ruler at the time of the 26th Emperor Keitai (traditionally ruled 507‚Äì531) before he became the unified Yamato under his rule. Mizuno Y≈´ even argues that the Emperor Seinei, Kenz≈ç and Ninken did not exist at all and that Iitoyo reigned after Emperor Y≈´ryaku for 15 years.

Most of the East Reserve's earliest settlers were from the Kleine Gemeinde or Bergthaler Mennonite churches. After signing Treaty 1 with the Anishinabe and Swampy Cree First Nations, the Canadian government sent William Hespeler to Russia to recruit Mennonite farmers to the region. In 1873 Mennonite delegates from the Russian Empire, (David Klassen, Jacob Peters, Heinrich Wiebe, and Cornelius Toews), visited the area and agreed to a Privilegium outlining religious freedom, military exemption, and land. This land became known as the East Reserve, because it was east of the Red River. In the years that followed, thousands of Mennonites settled in this area. The East Reserve was initially set aside exclusively for Mennonite settlement and settlers established dozens of villages, a few of which remain today, including Steinbach, now an independent municipality, Grunthal, Kleefeld, and Blumenort. The reserve was governed using the system the Mennonites had learned in Prussia. Each village had a Schulz, or mayor, while the whole reserve had an Oberschulz. The East Reserve eventually opened up to settlement from other groups and became known as the Rural Municipality of Hanover. Briefly known as \\"The Mennonite Reserve\\" the name was quickly changed to \\"East Reserve\\" after a second reserve was established. The land of East Reserve was viewed by many as limited and unsuitable for farming, so a second reserve, called the West Reserve on the west side of the Red River was established in 1876. A smaller Scratching River settlement was also established in 1875 on the Morris River. In 1877, Lord Dufferin visited the Mennonite villages of the East Reserve and, from a rise just west of Steinbach could see \\"half a dozen villages\\" in the distance. More than 1000 people showed up to greet him. In 1880, the Manitoba government renamed the East Reserve as Hespeler and a year later, in 1881, the reserve was divided between the R.M. of Hespeler, no longer in existence, and the Rural Municipality of Hanover, which is slightly larger than the original East Reserve.

They are distributed from the river basin of the Orinoco and the Guianas south to the basins of the R√≠o Paran√° and R√≠o Paraguay . The two recognised genera of the Chaetobranchini have been classified together with Astronotus in the subfamily Astronotinae but the consensus is that this genus forms the monogeneric tribe, the Astronotini, these two each being one of the seven tribes in Cichlinae. Characteristics The species in Chaetobranchini grow to lengths of in length and have an oval, laterally compressed body with a pointed head. They have small mouths and teeth, feed on plankton using filaments on their gill arches as a filter. The chaetobranchins possess a very reduced lower pharyngeal jaw which has elongated lateral processes, a keel and conical teeth. Chaetobranchines are also characterised by their long pointed pectoral fins, which extend alsmot to the end of the base of the anal fin and the three or four long posterior lateral lines which reach to the caudal fin.

After signing Treaty 1 with the Anishinabe and Swampy Cree First Nations, the Canadian government sent William Hespeler to recruit Mennonite farmers to the region. In 1873 Mennonite delegates from the Russian Empire, (David Klassen, Jacob Peters, Heinrich Wiebe, and Cornelius Toews), visited the area and agreed to a Privilegium outlining religious freedom, military exemption, and land. This land became known as the East Reserve, because it was east of the Red River. After two years, however, it was determined that the land of East Reserve was limited and unsuitable for farming, so a second reserve on the west side of the Red River was established in 1876. This land became known as the West Reserve. In 1878, more than 200 Bergthal Mennonite relocated to the more fertile region of the West Reserve, and later immigrants moved directly to the region from Russia. These settlers established more than 70 villages, many of which still remain today including Altona, Neubergthal, and many others. Each village was governed by a Schulz, or mayor, and the entire West Reserve was governed by an Oberschulz. This system of governance ended with the establishment of Rural Municipalities. In 1897, the area was visited by Russian prince and anarchist Peter Kropotkin who praised the local Mennonites for their industriousness and communal lifestyle.

Hailes, along with a group of doctors, were instrumental in the creation of the Australasian Menopause Society. Early life and education Hailes was born on 22 June 1926 in Ascot Vale, Melbourne to surgeon William Allan Hailes and Mary Maud Whitfield. She had an older sister and a younger sister. Hailes attended Melbourne Church of England Girls Grammar School where in 1943, she reached head prefect. Hailes went on to attend the University of Melbourne where she obtained her MB, BS in 1949. She then began medical training at the Royal Melbourne Hospital where she completed her medical training as a resident medical officer in 1960. Career She worked at Travancore Developmental Centre as an officer who worked with children who were intellectually disabled. She overcame the neglect by doctors of the 'minor' symptoms of ageing women. She and physicist Robert Greenblatt got to know each other in the late 1960s in the United States and he helped her fix menopausal women's health needs. Hailes joined the Australian Red Cross Society in 1962, where she was a medical officer in the Victorian Division's blood transfusion service for ten years. Hailes confronted Australian medical practitioners for their neglect to promote this treatment (due to side-effect concerns). Professor Bryan Hudson and Dr. Henry Burger both supported Hailes. Hailes soon became an honorary clinical assistant at the Department of endocrinology and diabetes at the hospital and for nine years menopausal women went to Hailes for their menopausal related issues. Hailes, along with sympathetic woman doctors established and staffed a weekly half day clinic which accepted patients without requiring them to submit a medical referral. In 1971, Hailes created Australia's first health clinic, which was one of the first clinics in the world to address menopause. Hailes joined Monash University in 1972 as part of the health services of the students of the University before returning to the University of Melbourne in a similar role for three years later. Hailes established a second clinic at the Royal Women's Hospital in 1976 before becoming a menopause counselor from 1978 to 1986. She also was a clinical assistant at Royal Women's Hospital. The mainstream medicine industry supported Hailes for developing clinical and research expertise that was related to the health issues of older women. Hailes (with the Burger) developed a paper on a hormone replacement therapy research program titled \`Oestrogens and Menopausal and Post-menopausal Women‚Äô. The Medical Journal of Australia published this research program in 1977. She created a conference on menopause that was nationally covered five years later along with other doctors which led to the formation of Australasian Menopause Society. At society meetings, Hailes funded the Best Paper annual prize. Hailes raised public awareness that was intent on confronting myths on the issues related to menopause. She appeared on talkback radio and she spoke to community groups. She wrote a booklet ‚Äî The Middle Years in 1980 ‚Äî which in six years ran three editions. She worked with the feminist movement's health service establishment concurrent campaign. Hailes was appointed AM in 1986. Personal life Hailes married medical practitioner Henry Buckhurst Kay on 21 November 1951 in Christ Church, South Yarra, Victoria and together they had three children. On 27 November 1988 Hailes died of cancer at South Yarra. Her body was cremated soon after. Posthumous impact In 1992, the Jean Hailes Foundation for Women's Health was established to ensure that Hailes's work is continued in clinical research and educative dimension. The Jean Hailes Research Unit at Monash University, which connects the university to clinical services based in translation of knowledge, was named in Hailes' honour.

The outbreak of war caused her to be taken over by the Royal Navy and to be converted to a minelayer, carrying as many as 500 mines. She was widely used for minelaying in the North Sea and English Channel during the war, which she survived, having laid the most mines of any Royal Navy ship during the war. She remained in Royal Navy service following the end of the war, taking part in the British intervention in the Russian Civil War. She was sold for scrap in 1929. Construction and design In 1914, two fast passenger ships, and Princess Margaret, were being built by the Scottish shipbuilder William Denny for the Canadian Pacific Railway to use in its service between Vancouver and Seattle. Princess Margaret was launched at Denny's Dunbarton shipyard on 24 June 1914. At the outbreak of the First World War, the Royal Navy's minelaying capability was confined to seven old cruisers of the . These ships could carry 100‚Äì140 mines, and although originally having a design speed of , by 1914 they were only capable of . To improve the minelaying capability of the Royal Navy, Princess Irene and Princess Margaret were requisitioned and converted to minelayers. They were long overall with a beam of and a draught of .

They could carry up to 500 mines. Service=World War I= Princess Margaret loading mines at the Grangemouth minelaying base Princess Margaret was commissioned on 26 December 1914. By March 1915, she was listed as being a member of the Minelaying Squadron. On 8 May 1915 Princess Margaret and Princess Irene laid a minefield northwest of Heligoland, with Princess Margaret laying 490 mines. On 16 August 1915, Princess Margaret, escorted by two divisions of the 10th Destroyer Flotilla, eight destroyers in total, was tasked with laying a minefield on the Amrum Bank. At about 8:45 pm five patrolling German destroyers encountered the British force near the Horns Reefs light vessel. The German destroyer fired two torpedoes, one of which stuck the British destroyer . Princess Margaret turned away to avoid the attack, with the rest of the British destroyers (most of which had not spotted the German ships and thought that Mentor had struck a mine) following. The German force also turned away, and Mentor, which had her bow blown off, was left by herself to make her way back to base. Despite the damage, Mentor made it safely back to Harwich. On 10 September 1915 Princess Margaret and the minelayers and set out from the Humber with a close escort of six destroyers and with heavy distant covering forces (including most of the rest of the Harwich Force and the Battle Cruiser Force out of Rosyth) on Operation CY, another attempt to lay a minefield off the Amrum Bank. This time the Germans did not interfere, and the three minelayers laid a total of 1,450 mines on the night of 10/11 September. The German light cruiser struck a mine in this minefield on the night of 21/22 April 1916. On the night of 8/9 November 1915 Princess Margaret and Angora laid another field of 850 mines to replace the field laid in September, which had been discovered by the Germans. While the minefield was laid successfully, the destroyer , part of the covering force, struck a German mine on the return journey to Harwich. Operation XX By March 1916, Princess Margaret was listed as flagship of the Minesweeping Squadron. On 20 March 1916, Princess Margaret, Orviedo, and laid mines in the North Sea approaches to the English Channel and Thames, between the North Hinder and Galloper light ships. On 24 April 1916, Princess Margaret, together with Biarritz, Orvieto and Paris, laid a large minefield off the Belgian coast, which was supplemented by mine-nets laid by trawlers, in order to constrain the activities of German submarines based in Flanders. On 3‚Äì4 May 1916, the British launched Operation XX, an attempt to lure the German High Seas Fleet out to sea where it could be attacked, and to draw German naval forces away from the Baltic. The seaplane carriers and would launch an air attack on the German Airship base at Tondern. Minefields would be laid at the exits of the swept channels through the Heligoland Bight, which any German forces sortieing in response would have to pass through, with 10 submarines waiting off the Horns Reef and off Terschelling. The Battle Cruiser Force would be waiting off Terschelling, while the battleships of the Grand Fleet would provide distant cover. Princess Margaret set off from the Humber on 3 May 1916, escorted by the destroyers and , bound for the western end of the Heligoland Bight. Princess Margaret left her escorts west of the proposed minefield, continuing alone, and successfully laid 530 mines. The air raid itself was a failure, with only one aircraft managing to attack its target, and the hoped for confrontation between the British and German fleets did not occur, although one German airship, L 7, was shot down by the British light cruisers and . On 15 May 1916, Princess Margaret laid mines off the Belgian coast to reinforce the existing minefields. Princess Margaret and Paris laid mines near the Thornton Ridge on 24 May 1916, and on 4 August 1916, the British light cruiser stuck a mine off the Thornton Ridge, probably from this minefield. On 18 May 1916, as a response to the German Bombardment of Yarmouth and Lowestoft on 24 April that year, Princess Margaret, Paris and Biarritz laid a defensive minefield between Lowestoft and Caister to prevent further attacks by German surface warships. On 28 November 1916 Princess Margaret returned to operations in the Bight when, escorted by the destroyers , and , she laid 500 mines west of Borkum. Early in 1917, Admiral Beatty, commander of the Grand Fleet, proposed to completely block off the Heligoland Bight with mines. While this was not practicable at the time owing to a lack of efficient mines, minelaying operations in the Bight continued steadily in January 1917. Princess Margaret and laid 452 mines in the central part of the Bight on 25 January. Operations in the Bight continued in February, with Princess Margaret laying 543 mines out of a total of 1464 laid in the Bight that month. A minefield laid by Princess Margaret on 29 March 1917 may have sunk the German submarine sometime after 19 April that year. On the night of 20/21 April, Princess Margaret, Angora, Wahine and laid 1308 mines south west of the Horns Reef, the largest minefield of the war, while on 27/28 April, Princess Margaret, Angora and Wahine laid another 1000 mines north west of Heligoland. As well as mining the Bight, Princess Margaret continued to lay defensive minefields in home waters, and on 8 May 1917, together with Angora and Wahine, laid 416 mines off Orfordness. On 20 May 1917, Princess Margaret, Angora and Wahine laid a field of 1000 mines north of Vlieland. While quickly discovered by the Germans, this minefield proved highly effective, sinking the minesweeper on 8 June 1917, SS Turin on 15 June 1916 and the submarine on 29 November 1917. Later that month, Princess Margaret was under repair owing to turbine problems. From 21 November 1917, Princess Margaret took part, together with the minelayers and Paris, the minelaying destroyers Ferret, , and and several minelaying trawlers, in laying the Dover Barrage, a series of deep minefields between Cap Gris Nez and Folkestone intended to stop German submarines from entering the Channel from the east. Princess Margaret continued operations in the Channel until January 1918, when she was withdrawn to take part in the Northern Barrage, a more ambitious plan to block the exits of the North Sea to stop German U-boats from attacking shipping in the Atlantic. The start of laying the Northern Barrage was delayed by problems setting up bases and by the late arrival of American minelayers, and Princess Margaret, together with and the cruisers , and , laid a series of deep minefields at the entrance of the Kattegat to block passage from the Baltic to the North Sea, and later in February took part in laying a series of minefields near the Dogger Bank. Work began on laying the Northern Barrage in March 1918. By the end of the war, Princess Margaret had laid 25,242 mines, more than any other Royal Navy ship in the war. =Russian Civil War= Libau (Liepaja). December 1918 Shortly after the end of World War I, Princess Margaret was part of the initial British deployment to the Baltic during the British intervention in the Russian Civil War. She and Angora delivered supplies, including 5000 rifles, to the nascent Estonian army at the port of Reval in November 1918. In December 1918, Princess Margaret, together with the cruiser and two destroyers, was deployed to Latvia. The ships reached Riga on 19 December, and found the city in danger of capture by advancing Bolshevik forces. As the situation deteriorated, Princess Margaret embarked 350 refugees (mainly British, Allied and neutral civilians) on 28 December, with more refugees being embarked before the force left Riga on 3 January 1919, shortly before the city was captured by the Red Army. Princess Margaret then returned to Britain with the rest of the force, reaching Rosyth on 10 January. Princess Margaret was formally purchased by the Royal Navy on 14 June 1919, and soon returned to the Baltic as the British intervention continued, this time as a minelayer rather than a transport, and in company with the minelaying destroyers of the 20th Destroyer Flotilla, reaching Reval at the end of June. Princess Margaret and the minelaying destroyers laid minefields to protect the British base at Reval from potential attacks by Russian ships, with Princess Margaret returning to Britain in September once the minefields had been laid. She returned to the Baltic in October 1919, and was present when the German- controlled West Russian Volunteer Army attacked Riga, which had been freed from the Bolsheviks earlier in the year, on 8 October. On 12 October, refugees from the fighting, including members of the British Missions, were embarked aboard Princess Margaret. Princess Margaret returned to Britain in December 1919. =Later career= Princess Margaret was refitted as an Admiralty Yacht in 1921. On 7 November 1924, Princess Margaret collided with the Danish auxiliary sailing vessel Marie Margaretha in the English Channel off the Owers Lightship. Marie Margaretha sank, and Princess Margaret rescued all twelve members of her crew. Princess Margaret was sold for scrap on 30 May 1929.

It is a depiction of a woman with glowing eyes playing a flute in the moonlight by the edge of a dark jungle with a snake extending toward her from a nearby tree. History The Snake Charmer was commissioned by Berthe, Comtesse de Delaunay, the mother of artist Robert Delaunay. It was Rousseau's first large commission and was exhibited in the 1907 Autumn Salon. Because Rousseau never traveled outside of France, the exotic plants in the painting resulted from Rousseau's visits to the Jardin des plantes and from magazines. From 1922 to 1936, The Snake Charmer was in the collection of Jacques Doucet. It was promised to the Louvre in 1925 and became part of its collection in 1937. Description The painting has an asymmetric vertical composition with a detailed depiction of the jungle on the right and a woman playing the flute on the left, back-lit by moonlight from a full moon. A snake, charmed by the music, stretches horizontally across the painting. The Mus√©e d'Orsay described the painting as \\"a black Eve in a disquieting Garden of Eden\\".

That was before he became in 1951 a member of the Neo-Destour Federation, for Tunis and its suburbs. He was also elected member of the Neo-Destour National Council, during the party 5th Congress, held in Sfax, in November 1955. He was equally a trade-union activist within the Tunisian General Labour Union (UGTT), since its inception in 1946, he was a member-elect of the Executive Bureau of the labour regional union for the Tunis constituency, from 1947 to 1949, during its 3rd Congress, held in Tunis in April 1949.

Naceur Ben Ja√¢far was arrested and detained several times, between 1952 and 1954, for, among other accusations, fomenting struggle against the colonisers, writing and disseminating tracts denouncing colonisation. He was thus imprisoned in the Jalal camp in Ben Gardane (January‚ÄìSeptember 1952), the Tataouine military prison (May‚ÄìSeptember 1953), and the Bordj le Boeuf camp (June‚ÄìSeptember 1954).

Gameplay In designing Borderlands, the Future Pastimes team at Eon Productions wanted to create a simpler and shorter version of Diplomacy, without the need for written orders or the need to leave the table for negotiations. The game is set on an abstract continent, and players represent barbaric tribes who conquer territories, trade gathered resources, and construct cities, boats and weapons. The first player (or alliance of players) to conquer or build three cities is the winner. The game components are: * a 20\\" x 24\\" map divided into 36 irregular-shaped territories * 16 counters representing available resources (coal, gold, horse breeding grounds and forests). Each resource token can be \\"broken\\" into a number of smaller tokens to be used for trading. * 80 army counters (20 per player) * Other counters representing horses, river boats, cities, and weapons. The first step is to distribute the 16 resource tokens randomly across the map (no more than one per territory). Players then place their army counters on the map with regard to capturing resources, offensive and defensive operations. After set-up, each turn is divided into five phases: # Development (always happens) # Production (may not occur) # Trade (may not occur) # Shipment (may not occur) # Attack (always happens) For Phases 2, 3 and 4, a 6-sided die is rolled; on a 1‚Äì4, the phase occurs, on a 5‚Äì6, that phase is skipped. Each player can participate in each phase. Although the game is designed for four players, there are rules for 2- and 3-player games. Games generally last 45‚Äì60 minutes. Legacy Eon published two expansion sets, with rules for five and six players respectively that also included new resources and map expansions. The software division of Eon created the video game Lords of Conquest based on Borderlands. It was published in 1986 by Electronic Arts for the Commodore 64, Apple II, Atari 8-bit family, Atari ST, and IBM PC. Reception In the December 1982 edition of The Space Gamer (Issue No. 58), Allen Varney commented that \\"If you like Diplomacy, but you've always had trouble getting that fifth or sixth player, you must have Borderlands at any cost. If you're a more conventional wargamer, you'll still find it exceptionally fun and challenging, though the price is a bit stiff.\\" In the August 1983 edition of Dragon (Issue 76), although Tony Watson had issues with the high price ($20), he called it \\"a very good game. Its combination of simple rules, engrossing strategy, and attractive graphics make it a sure winner. Its simplicity and short playing time (a game can be finished in about two hours) make it a fine choice for an evening‚Äôs play.\\" Ten years later, in a retrospective article in the December 1993 edition of Dragon (Issue 200), Allen Varney called Borderlands \\"a gripping contest of strategy, diplomacy and resource management...

During the conflict, William the Silent ordered the destruction of several dykes in order to stop the Spaniards who were at that time surrounding the Dutch city of Leiden. This tactic proved to be successful as the Spanish troops were greatly affected by the incoming water that took them by surprise. The Spanish troops lost their mobility whereas the troops mustered by William the Silent had prepared for the water using small ships. With the help of the controlled destruction of dykes in 4 strategic locations, the city of Leiden could be freed with the help of the Sea Beggars, better known as the Geuzen. Now, the people in Leiden who had been starving for months could be fed with herring, which became a Dutch tradition in the remembrance of The Siege of Leiden.Battles, James B. (September 2014). \\"Sea Beggars, Loaves, Fishes, and Turkey: The influence of Leidens Ontzet (Relief of Leiden) on the Pilgrims Thanksgiving\\" (PDF). the Mayflower Quarterly: 136. Retrieved 11/10/2018 History During the Dutch Revolt, Spanish troop under the direct supervision of the Duke of Alba, wanted to force the city of Leiden, which was a notable city in The Netherlands at the time, into submission. Spanish troops mostly had military successes up to 1574 leaving the Dutch people in disparity and starvation. The Siege at the city of Leiden was no outlier to this. Even though the besieging circumstances were horrific for the Spanish troops, they managed to surround the city successfully. A long lasting siege started which took lives on both sides of the city walls. The breaking of the dykes was something Spanish forces were not at all prepared for and the Dutch had gained the help of the Sea Beggars. This was a pirate like group of people who had turned to help the Dutch and were very effective in their endeavor of hindering or beating down the Spanish cause. The Sea Beggars were crucial in the Relief of Leiden as the destroying of the dykes had caused much of the land surrounding Leiden to be underwater. The Sea Beggars had boats to sail over this water and attack or scare away the Spanish troops who were, as a result of the water, trapped either in the water or on small hills which were surrounded by water. The Sea Beggars together with the rest of the Dutch rebel force were able to bring food to the starving population of Leiden, which by now has become a tradition. Every year the Relief of Leiden is celebrated in the Netherlands on the third of October. People come together and eat the traditional herring with white bread, the same food the Sea Beggars gave to the starved people in Leiden. Up until now the breaking of the dyke at Capelle aan den IJssel and at several other places is often seen as one of the crucial moments in the creation of the Dutch Republic and the start of freedom.Darby, Graham (2001).

Retrieved 11/15/2018 The Monument The monument was designed by J. Nieuwehuis, an employee of the Dutch governmental company Rijkswaterstaat. The monument is meant as an ironic gesture towards the Spanish Duke of Alba who is up until today a hated figure in Dutch History due to his radical approach towards the Dutch population at the time. The name Dukdalf was inspired on the Sea Beggars who had a great part in the relief of the besieging of Leiden. They named it after a commonly referred to method used by water lock managers in their effort to keep ships from sailing into the water lock. This name has little to no relation to the events that are represented by the monument. The monument consists of four pillars and each pillar has an inscription. One of which is a portrayal of William the Silent on a horse. The other three each are textual representations of the breaking of the dykes. one honors the Sea Beggars and the Orange prince (William the Silent), the other describes the date on which the monument was created which was on the third of October 1984 and this opening was celebrated by Mr. S. Patijn; a commissioner for the King operating in the Dutch province of Zuid-Holland.

At the time of its nomination it contained 48 resources, which included 28 contributing buildings, two contributing sites, two contributing structures, 12 non-contributing buildings, and four non-contributing structures. Colfax was platted in 1866 or 1867 as a railroad and farm-to-market town along the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad. Coal mines were also located to the south of town. Mineral water was discovered in the area in 1875, which led to the development of the mineral water-based health industry in Colfax. The historic district represents the growth during this time period. After the health-related mineral water industry declined, Colfax expanded its farm-to-market economy in the late inter-war and post-World War II years. The historic district covers Colfax's central business district, and includes civic buildings, churches, retail establishments, fraternal organizations, banks, automobile-related strictures, and two parks. The buildings are between one and three stories with most being one to two stories. Most of the buildings are of masonry construction with the former Presbyterian Church parsonage, the only house in the district, built of wood. It is also the only first generation building left in the district. Many of the other buildings from that era (1860s-1890s) were destroyed in fires or tornados.

Newman (October 26, 1937 ‚Äì August 1, 2018) was an American physician, scientist, health manager and philanthropist.  Life  Robert Gabriel Newman was born in The Hague, Netherlands, as child of German emigrants. At that time his parents, as Jews, were on the escape from national-socialist Germany. His father, Rudolph Neumann (later Randolph Newman), and mother Eva Neumann, born Feilchenfeldt (later Eva Newman), both were legal practitioners. The family then moved to New York City in August 1939. After the end of World War II Newman for some years lived in Frankfurt/Main, Germany, where his father, as a legal practitioner, took part in the liquidation of IG Farben. 1958 Newman received a bachelor's degree at Washington Square College of New York University, until 1963 earned an MD (medical degree) at the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry and acquired a Master of Public Health (MPH) degree at the School of Public Health University of California, Berkeley. Professional stations e.g. were: 1967 service as physician in the US Air Force in Fukuoka, Japan, from 1970 Assistant Commissioner, Addiction Programs, New York City Department of Health, from 1976 vice president and from 1978 to 1997 president and CEO of Beth Israel Medical Center (BIMC), today Mount Sinai Beth Israel in Downtown Manhattan, New York City, 1997‚Äì2001 president and CEO of Continuum Health Partners, 2001‚Äì2013 director of Baron Edmond de Rothschild Chemical Dependency Institute of BIMC. Between 1994 and 2012 Newman was professor each at Dept. of Epidemiology and Population Health and at Dept. of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences of Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York City. Newmans special professional, scientific and humanitarian interest was dedicated to the treatment of drug addicts, especially of heroin addicts. As early as 1968 Newman met the physicians and researchers couple Marie Nyswander and Vincent Dole, who in 1964 in New York City had begun to treat heroin addicts with methadone. Under the director of the New York City Dept. of Health, Gordon Chase, at the term of office of New York Mayor John Lindsay, Newman became the opportunity, to introduce and expand the methadone therapy at a larger scale. This expansion was not undisputed. In 1998 New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani even intended to downsize the local methadone programs, but was not successful with this. Worldwide, Newman was counseling numerous institutions in the introduction of methadone therapy, e.g. in Hong Kong or in Germany. This engagement earned Newman the nickname \\"methadone apostle\\" or \\"methadone pope\\". A motto of Newman about heroin dependency respectively methadone treatment was: \\"It‚Äôs a medical problem ‚Äì for which a treatment exists, but for which at the moment a cure does not\\". Newman continuously emphasized the humanitarian aspects of dealing with the drug-dependent patients. Newman was married to Seiko Newman, born Kusuba; they have two children. In June 2018, Newman was victim of a car accident in The Bronx, of which sequelae he finally died.

Clayton, published by the Harvard University Asia Center. It discusses the Handover of Macau from Portugal to the People's Republic of China and the associated processes. According to Sin Wen Lau of Australia National University, the book's focus is a cultural identity for the Chinese population in Macau promoted by the Portuguese government.Lau, p. 187. Background The author, an anthropologist at the University of Hawaii,Entenmann, p. 970. conducted fieldwork for two years,Chu, p. 112. including six weeks in the summer of 1999, months prior to the handover of Macau. She interviewed teachers and administrators in Macau schools, and she also interviewed visitors to the Museum of Macau.Chu, p. 111. Contents The book includes an introduction, five body chapters, and a conclusion. Each chapter discusses a different aspect of the 1999 handover process.Chu, p. 110. The initial three chapters discuss sociocultural aspects, while the following three discuss the creation of a Macau identity.Lau, p. 188. Chapter 1 discusses the creation of Portuguese governance over Macau, described by the author as being jointly \\"shared and contested\\" instead of belonging entirely to one country. Chapter 2, \\"Outlaw Tales,\\" discusses the prevalence of organised crime in pre-handover Macau and the perceived inability of the Portuguese authorities to control it. Chapter 3 outlined the political complications of nationality in Macau, the definition of Chinese-ness, the identity of the Macanese people, and the 1999 Resolution on Nationality. In particular the Macanese people could choose between Chinese and Portuguese nationalities, something some of the Chinese without Portuguese ancestry were unable to do, but it prevented them from having the ambiguous identity they had for a period.Hung, p. 1120-1121. Chapter 4 discusses the overall unwillingness in Macau schools to teach the history of Macau, due to political controversies, a lack of consensus over what happened, a relative unimportance, and the necessity to prepare for examinations in other subjects.Chu, p. 110-111. Yuan-Horng Chu () of National Chiao Tung University stated \\"For Clayton, that the very idea of teaching local history would be so controversial tells of the contestation and volatility of the local in a place and time at the edges of sovereignty.\\" Chapter 5 discusses how places are named, the nostalgia around them, and how the groups of Macau experience them. The Chinese population largely was unaware of the Portuguese names of places, including streets, which differ from the names of the places in Chinese. The author stated that this shows, in regards to most people living in Macau, the Portuguese sovereignty had \\"irrelevance\\".Hung, p. 1121. Chapter 6 outlines how the Museum of Macao presents history and how this affects the view of sovereignty in Macau. The author stated that the people living in Macau perceived history differently despite the museum's attempt to have a single unified history. Chapter 7 discusses the \\"Outlawed Tales\\", including a history of a family, a play, and an opinion, which reflect Macau residents' own views of themselves, their residence, and sovereignty. The book's conclusion discusses the handover of Macau, including the coordination involved between the two parties. Reception Eva Po Wah Hung () of the University of Macau argued that the book was \\"very well-written\\".Hung, p. 1120. Arguing that the Portuguese colonisation of Macau had not accomplished its goals, Hung stated that she disagreed with the author's interpretation of Macau history being \\"representing a more flexible type of sovereignty.\\" Lau stated that \\"The argument presented is sensitive, sophisticated and grounded in thick description.\\" R. E. Entenmann of St. Olaf College stated that the book was \\"thoughtful and nuanced\\", rating it two stars and giving it a recommendation. Citing a large usage of first-person pronouns, he stated that the book was \\"highly anecdotal and personal\\".

It was co-founded by physician and obstetrician Temulji Bhicaji Nariman in 1887 and completed in 1895. Dwindling numbers of Parsi births in the latter half of the 20th century led to its closure. Origins During the 19th century, Bombay's Parsi women had largely given birth at home, confined to poorly ventilated and unsanitary conditions. In 1887, obstetrician and dean of Grant Medical College, Temulji Nariman, concerned about the prevalence of puerperal fever, founded the PLIH. The hospital was initially located in a small house facing the ocean in the Marine Lines. It was run by Nariman as the Parsi Maternity Asylum and established Nariman's name in the community. Shortly, however, a plot was bought from the government on the esplanade in the Hornby Estate of Mumbai. The building was designed by Muncherji Murzban, a key figure in the Bombay Municipal Corporation who was inspired by the Peabody estates of London and who oversaw the construction of the building. It was completed in 1895 at a cost 105,000 rupees but by 1914, the total cost had increased to 130,541 rupees. Fakirjee Dinshaw served as the contractor. It was one of the city's first maternity hospitals built in the Gothic Revival style. Arranged around a courtyard, it could accommodate 50 women. It became popularly known as Temuljinu Suvarvakhana (Temulji‚Äôs lying-house). Early years Previously, during their confinement, women had been located in the darkest and dampest corners of the house on the ground floor where sewage gases could contribute to ill-health. The PLIH, however, located women on upper floors with better hygiene and more space. The hospital acquired a reputation for cleanliness and the availability of midwives and clean linen. New mothers stayed for more than a month and it was felt by the Parsi community that it fulfilled an unmet need. Temulji Nariman became symbolic of \\"Parsi motherhood\\". He was the hospital's honorary secretary and chief physician at the time of the opening ceremony on 11 January 1895, and he encouraged the wealthier Parsis to allow those poorer to make use of its placements. The fee structure had three tiers. The third class received free treatment, the second class paid 1.80 rupees per day and first class paid 3 rupees per day. A refundable deposit was also taken. Within the first four years, about 1,750 patients had been treated and by the turn of the 20th century, Parsi women had three hospitals to choose from within the district of the Esplanade, the Bomanjee Edaljee Allbless Obstetric Hospital, the Pestanjee Hormusjee Cama Hospital for Women and Children and the PLIH. Among notable Parsis born at the PLIH, were Feroze Gandhi in 1912. Jamsetji Tata was a committee member. Later years In the early 21st century there were plans to convert the grade 2B listed building into an orthopaedic hospital, however, in 2015 the first floor was being used as offices and the remainder of the building was empty.

The firm continued until it was merged into COWI North America, a subsidiary of COWI A/S of Denmark, in 2015.  History  Peter G. Buckland and Peter R. Taylor worked together for CBA- Swan Wooster on the design of the Burrard Inlet Crossing over Vancouver Harbour, a bridge that would in 1970 have had the tenth longest span in the world if it had been built. After the project was cancelled, Buckland and Taylor founded their own civil engineering design company. In 1984 Brian D. Morgenstern became an equal shareholder with Buckland and with Taylor. In the 1980s the company made the decision to focus on bridges only. A significant influence was the adoption by funding agencies of the design-build process, which induced civil engineering design companies to collaborate with construction firms in the development of competitive designs for durable, economical bridges with an increased emphasis on ease and speed of erection.

To reduce the weight of the roadway, asphalt and concrete were removed and special steel plating (an orthotropic deck) was used in its place. This deck is 35% lighter than the old one. In 2015, at a cost of $150 million, every piece of steel that made up the suspended spans, except the towers and two main cables, was replaced.

It sits to the west of Blackpool Bridge on the southern bank of the Eastern River Cleddau, downstream from Canaston Bridge. Built in 1813 on the site of former ironworks, the mill is a Grade-II* listed building, which is intact and contains working machinery, but has ceased commercial operation. Blackpool Mill is listed by RCAHMW as an historic place name. The mill race (2007) The mill was originally powered by a centre water wheel, in diameter and wide. A turbine replaced the wheel about 1900, driving four pairs of stones. The mill remained in use until 1958; the drive was converted to electricity. In 1968, renovations enabled the building to be opened to the public. Currently, the mill is closed to the public but features in the Narberth to Blackpool Mill Walk. Several other features of the site are listed by Coflein: Blackpool bridge, a furnace, the mill leat and the wharf. Bluestone In 2016, Bluestone, a nearby holiday resort, announced plans to spend ¬£2.5 million restoring the site with the addition of a miniature railway as a tourist attraction, but following objections from the National Park, the plans were deferred by Bluestone, and subsequently rejected, with Bluestone invited to re-apply. In 2020, Bluestone was granted planning permission to convert the mill into a 160-seat restaurant.

The name probably expressed the wild and rugged nature of the country, for the word signified hard and rugged (œÉŒ∫ŒØœÅŒøŒΩ, œÉŒ∫Œµ·øñœÅŒøŒΩ, œÉŒ∫ŒªŒ∑œÅœåŒΩ, Hesych.). It was bounded by Maenalia on the north, and by Parrhasia on the west, and was originally part of Arcadia, but was conquered at an early period, and its inhabitants reduced to the condition of Lacedaemonian Perioeci. According to Xenophon they were subjected to Sparta even before the time of Lycurgus.Xenophon De Rep. Lac. 100.12. They were distinguished above all the other Perioeci for their bravery; and their contingent, called the Œ£Œ∫ŒπœÅŒØœÑŒ∑œÇ ŒªœåœáŒøœÇ, 600 in number, usually occupied the extreme left of the Lacedaemonian wing. They were frequently placed in the post of danger, and sometimes remained with the king as a body of reserve.Xen. Cyr. 4.2.1; On the first invasion of Laconia by the Thebans the Sciritae, together with the Perioeci of Caryae and Sellasia, revolted from Sparta, in consequence of which their country was subsequently ravaged by the Lacedaemonians. The only towns in the Sciritis appear to have been Scirus and Oeum called Ium by Xenophon. The latter is the only place in the district mentioned in historical times. Scirus may perhaps have been the same as Scirtonium (Œ£Œ∫ŒπœÅœÑœéŒΩŒπŒøŒΩ), in the district of Aegytis. The road from Sparta to Tegea led through the Sciritis.

Indonesian Meteorology, Climatology, and Geophysical Agency reported 12 aftershocks, the strongest one occurring at 02:22 local time with a strength of 3.5. BMKG attributed the earthquake to a thrust fault movement of an unmapped fault, adding that the region historically saw relatively low seismicity and that the earthquake was not caused by the larger and more destructive earthquakes in Sulawesi and Lombok. According to Indonesian National Board for Disaster Management (BNPB) spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the earthquake was felt in 22 regencies and cities in East Java province, including the provincial capital and Indonesia's second-largest city Surabaya. No tsunami warnings were issued, and none occurred. Attendees of the 2018 International Monetary Fund Summit in Denpasar reported feeling the earthquake, but no damage occurred and the summit continued without significant disruption. Casualties The earthquake killed 4 people, and injured at least 26. As the earthquake struck around 2 AM, many of the victims were asleep during the shaking and could not escape. Three of the deaths occurred in Prambanan village of Sapudi Island and were caused by falling roof shrapnel, while the fourth fatality was in Jember, where a 47-year-old man died after he slipped and hit his head when running out of his house during the earthquake. Aftermath Nearly 500 houses were reported to be damaged by the day following the earthquake in Sapudi Island alone, with lesser damage in other regencies. Cleanup operations, assisted by soldiers from Kodam V/Brawijaya, began soon after the earthquake. Social minister Agus Gumiwang visited Sapudi later in the day of the earthquake. Governor of East Java Soekarwo also visited the island, and promised that the provincial government would incur the costs of repairing damaged houses, with the provincial administration allocating Rp 23.7 billion (US$1.6 million) for the purpose. The central government also provided benefits of Rp 15 million (~USD 1,000) for the relatives of the fatalities, in addition to smaller benefits from the local governments.

In the , Julago had a population of 113 people. It will be the site of Townsville's largest masterplanned real estate development in the years ahead.  Geography  The northern part of the locality is mountainous with the highest peak being Mount Muntalunga (228 metres) part of the Muntalunga Range and an unnamed peak (200 metres) and is mostly undeveloped bushland. Between these two mountains is a valley (40 meters above sea level). The Bruce Highway and the North Coast railway pass through the locality through this valley from the east to the north-west. Most of the housing in the locality is in this valley. The south part of the locality is used for grazing by the Rocky Springs station.  History  The locality was named and bounded on 27 July 1991. The name comes from the Julago railway station, assigned by the Queensland Railways Department from 7 May 1942 (as part of a World War II emergency crossing loop). The name is reportedly an Aboriginal word, meaning plains turkey.  Education  There are no schools in Julago. The nearest primary school is Wulguru State School in Wulguru to the north-west. The nearest secondary school is William Ross State High School in Annandale to the north-west.  Future urban development  In November 2016, the Deputy Premier of Queensland, Jackie Trad, announced that Townsville's largest master-planned community would be built on the Rocky Springs Land in a new development called Elliot Springs. When completed in 2050 (estimated), the estate will have over 10,600 homes and over 26,000 residents. Trad committed the Queensland Government to spend $15M on water and road infrastructure as part of co-investment with property developer Lendlease. The name Elliot Springs reflects that Mount Elliot will be the backdrop to the new development, which will also have views of Mount Jack, Mount Stuart and the Muntalunga Ranges. LendLease expect the first display village with homes constructed by 13 building companies will open in January 2019.

He reigned under the name of Udayaraja II, Ramathipadi IV or Naranayraja II. Outey was the oldest son of Prince Outey Reachea (1707 - 1753) and Princess Peou, a daughter of King Ang Em, which made him heir to both rival branches of the Varman dynasty, since Outey's grandfather was King Ang Tong, who had ruled Cambodia. When Outey was born in 1740, one year after the Vietnamese were expelled by the Siamese army, Chey Chettha's son King Thommo Reachea was ruling Cambodia for the third time in his life, until he died in 1747. Thommo Reachea son and heir was murdered by a brother, the ministers chose a third brother as King, Ang Tong in 1748, but after being attacked by his relative Satha and a Vietnamese army, he fled to Siam. During his exile, the people in Cambodia drove out the Vietnamese once again, and chose Chey Chettha V as King, who after ruling Cambodia for six years, died in 1755, when Outey's grandfather Ang Tong once again was elected King. Ang Tong died in Pursat in 1757 and Outey became King in 1758, after his grandfather Ang Tong's death. Outey chose to rule under the protection of the Vietnamese, refused to help the Siamese king Taksin and provoked the Siamese king by calling him \\"half-Chinese\\", resulting in Siam sending an army in 1769, during which second invasion he fled to Vietnam in 1771, but returned later, and was reestablished as puppet king in Oudong by a Vietnamese army. A year later he had to flee to Vietnam again. He returned once again in 1772, and reigned again, under the supervision of a Vietnamese official. Because King Outey II reduced his support of Siamese king Taksin, and after provocations Taksin invaded Cambodia, burned down Phnom Penh, and after Outey abdicated, his cousin Ang Non II was elected king in 1775. Outey received the title Maha Upayuvaraja () after his abdication.Le Clair. The title meant \\"Great Joint King\\" and was usually borne by kings who had abdicated but retained executive powers. In return, Outey's elder brother Ang Tham was crowned as Maha Uparaja the title of heir apparent. In Vietnamese records, Ang Non, Outey and Ang Tham were called the First King, the Second King and the Third King, respectively. However, this arrangement proved to be unsatisfactory. Both Outey and Ang Tam were assassinated in 1777, probably by Ang Non II. NotesCitationsReferences :: Dauphin-Meunier, Achille, Histoire du Cambodge, P.U.F, Paris, 1968 Que sais-je ?

It was an historical docudrama about the Royal Northwest Mounted Police (later the Royal Canadian Mounted Police), based on the 1921 book of the same name by Rev. R. G. MacBeth, a Vancouver minister and well-known popular historian. Director A. D. Kean believed in the ideal of a Canadian film industry that would celebrate Canadian and British history, values, and institutions. He also intended the film as a corrective to the clich√©d and inaccurate portrayal of the RNWMP and its members in the numerous \\"Mountie movies\\" that were churned out by Hollywood studios during the silent era. Through personal contacts, he was able to secure the co-operation of the RCMP, including the loan of uniforms and equipment. Assistant Commissioner T. A. Wroughton, of the RCMP's \\"E\\" Division, served as the film's technical advisor, and led a squad of Mounties shown in the opening scenes.  Plot  The film depicted episodes from the first fifty years of the force's existence, including: the Cypress Hills Massacre; the force's creation and March West; its relations with First Nations peoples on the prairies; the founding of Fort Macleod; the pursuit of whisky traders; the building of the Canadian Pacific Railway; the Canadian sojourn of Sitting Bull and his followers; the Klondike Gold Rush; and modern police methods in the 1920s.[Kean, A.

Kean papers, MS-2456, box 2 file 2, BC Archives.  Cast  The cast members were almost all non-professionals; many were recruited more for their ability to ride and handle horses convincingly, rather than for any noteworthy acting ability. Leading parts were played by Alfred Crump, Jack Downing [a.k.a. Jack Boyd], Joe Fleiger, Dorothy Fowler, James G. Harrison, Donald Hayes, Senior Heaton, Margaret Lougheed, Norman Randall, and Col. T. A. Wroughton. In addition, many members of the Blood First Nation appeared in crowd and camp scenes, wearing traditional dress and riding their own horses.Duffy & Mattison, 35-36.  Locations  Policing the Plains was shot largely on location, at Green Lake, Vancouver and Victoria (British Columbia); Macleod, Standoff, Banff, and Buffalo National Park, near Wainwright (Alberta); Amulet (Saskatchewan); Lower Fort Garry (Manitoba); and Toronto (Ontario). Much of the outdoor action was filmed on the Blood Indian Reserve near Macleod. Interior scenes were later shot in Trenton, Ontario, at the studios of the Ontario Motion Picture Bureau.Duffy & Mattison, 36-38.  Production difficulties  Policing the Plains began production in April 1924 under Kean's own Western Pictures Company; after a financial re-organization in 1925, it was completed by Policing the Plains Productions Ltd. Initially budgeted at $40,000 (Canadian), the film eventually cost over $125,000. Kean was the sole screenwriter, producer, director, and cinematographer, and also handled publicity and some of the fund-raising. The film was in production for a prolonged period‚Äînearly three and half years‚Äîand ran into a host of financial, logistical, and technical difficulties. Policing the Plains premiered publicly in a six-day run at the Royal Alexandra Theatre in Toronto, Ontario, December 19 to 24, 1927. Kean was unable to secure further exhibition and distribution for the picture, and eventually it was lost.

The Toronto Globe reviewer was enthusiastic, calling the film \\"a triumph for Canadian enterprise.\\" The Daily Star praised its authenticity, but criticized its lack of \\"dramatic technique.\\" Other writers pointed out its inadequate resources and funding, poor direction, and box office failure. Like virtually all 20th century motion pictures about the history of the West in North America, the film embraced the ideology of settler colonialism, and the idea that the displacement and assimilation of indigenous peoples was necessary to make room for settlement and development by Europeans. The narrative of the Canadian West may have been depicted as more benign, more orderly, and much less violent than that of the American West‚Äîbut the ultimate objective was still containment and control of the First Nations.  Preservation status  Policing the Plains is considered to be a lost film.

It has thin wiry, straggly stems with a small number of small leaves and up to four greenish or brownish flowers with a conspicuous white labellum. It grows in drier rainforests and coastal scrub in New South Wales, southern Queensland and New Caledonia.  Description  Dendrobium bowmanii is an epiphytic or lithophytic herb that has thin, wiry, straggly, spreading or pendent stems up to long and about wide with a few branches. The leaves are cylindrical, dark green, long and about wide. The flowering stems are long and bear between up to four greenish yellow to pale brown flowers long and wide with a few reddish streaks. The sepals and petals spread apart from each other, the sepals long and wide, the petals a similar length but narrower. The labellum is white, about long and wide with three lobes. The side lobes are erect and the middle lobe turns downward and has wavy edges and three ridges along the midline. Flowering occurs throughout the year with flushes from August to November and February to June. Taxonomy and naming Dendrobium bowmanii was first formally described in 1873 by George Bentham and the description was published in Flora Australiensis. The specific epithet (bowmanii) is apparently a reference to Edward Macarthur Bowman who collected the type material. Distribution and habitat The straggly pencil orchid grows in drier rainforests and in coastal scrub between the Forty Mile Scrub National Park in Queensland and the Clarence River in New South Wales. It is also widespread in New Caledonia. It also has, in rare cases, been recorded hybridising with the cucumber orchid (Dendrobium cucumerinum) where they grow together.

It was formed in the summer of 1941 and served in the region south and west of Leningrad during the following months against the advance of Army Group North during Operation Barbarossa. It survived a German armored counterattack before being pulled back into the reserves in September. In January 1942, it was assigned to the Mobile Group of 2nd Shock Army to take part in the Lyuban Offensive Operation. This offensive aimed to encircle and destroy the German forces besieging Leningrad; in the event, 2nd Shock was itself encircled and forced to break out as individuals and small groups from May into July. The 25th Cavalry was disbanded, and its survivors were used to help rebuild the badly depleted 19th Guards Rifle Division, while the 25th's commanding officer took over the latter division.  Formation  The 25th Cavalry Division began forming on 9 July 1941 at Pskov in the Leningrad Military District. It was given the number of a pre-war cavalry division that had been disbanded in the same District in 1940. When formed, its basic order of battle was as follows: * 98th Cavalry Regiment * 100th Cavalry Regiment * 104th Cavalry Regiment The division was commanded by Kombrig Nikolai Ivanovich Gusev. This officer would have his rank modernized as Major General on 9 November and would remain in command until 20 January 1942. Gusev would go on to command several Soviet armies during the remainder of the War, rising to the rank of Colonel General on 5 May 1945. The 25th was almost immediately assigned to the 34th (Reserve) Army. When Army Group North paused in its advance on Leningrad in early August, Northwestern Front was ordered by the STAVKA to mount a counterstroke to retake the city of Staraya Russa which would be led primarily by 34th Army. The orders included the following: This attack was planned for 12 August, but was preempted by the renewal of the German drive on 10 August, and so achieved mixed results. The 25th, operating in a mobile group with the 163rd and 202nd Motorized Divisions, advanced 40km westward through the German defenses and reached the Dno - Staraya Russa rail line by 14 August. This enveloped the German X Army Corps in the latter city and threatened the rear of the panzer group advancing on Novgorod. 16th Army was forced to intervene with the LVI Panzer Corps, which by 25 August had driven 34th Army back to the Lovat line with 30 percent losses. However, this also delayed the German advance on Leningrad by ten days.David M. Glantz, The Battle for Leningrad 1941 - 1944, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2002, pp. 54-57 Later Service and Disbandment In September the division was moved to the reserves of Northwestern Front for rebuilding, where it would remain into December.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1941, pp. 50, 61, 72 In that month it was briefly assigned to 52nd Army in Volkhov Front.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1942, p. 8 On 20 January 1942, General Gusev was assigned to take command of 2nd Shock Army's 13th Cavalry Corps,Glantz, Leningrad, p. xviii to which the 25th was soon subordinated. Lt. Col. David Markovich Barinov, Gusev's chief of staff, took command of the division the next day, and he would remain in this post until it was disbanded. Meanwhile, Volkhov Front began its Lyuban Offensive across the Volkhov River on 6 January, before its full forces, most importantly its artillery, was fully in place. As a result the attackers were slow to make gains, at heavy cost. It was not until the night of 23-24 January that the Front commander, Gen. K. A. Meretskov, was able to convince himself that 2nd Shock Army had torn enough of a hole in the German defenses that he could commit the 13th Corps, plus a rifle division of 59th Army, into the gap. German counterattacks at once began trying to close it, and while on the one hand the mobile group was in a position to do harm in the German rear, its 30,000 troops also represented a target for destruction should the gap be closed.Glantz, Leningrad, pp. 158-58, 165 Over the following weeks more Soviet forces were fed into the pocket, but a counterattack by German 18th Army succeeded in closing the gap on 20 March. A week later a new gap was opened near the village of Miasnoi Bor, but it was only 3-5 km wide. The Red Army forces in the salient continued to operate under these circumstances through April and into May. On 12 May, Soviet intelligence indicated that 18th Army was about to attack again to cut the corridor. In light of this, orders came from the STAVKA to begin a phased withdrawal from the salient on 14 May; when this proved impossible due to the depleted state of its forces, a full breakout and withdrawal was ordered on 21 May.Glantz, Leningrad, pp. 176-79, 196-99 During June and July individual men and small parties of the 25th Cavalry, by now entirely dismounted, made their way through the thinly-held German lines. The division was officially disbanded on 15 July, and its survivors were combined with those of the 19th Guards Rifle Division to begin that division's rebuilding. On 27 July, Lt. Col. Barinov was promoted to colonel and took command of 19th Guards, whose commander had been officially listed as missing in action two days earlier.

Daughter to prominent, educated parents (her father was chief missionary leader and trader Sonie \\"John\\" Harrington), she was raised on the Gabonese coast of Africa, in the French occupied territory of Libreville, Gabon. Anyentyume traveled some, but spent the majority of her adult life within this area, teaching and doing missionary work. She was an advocate for women in her outspokenness against the double standard in expectations between men and women.  Education  Anyentyuwe was known as her father's favorite of many siblings, and he took great care in raising her to be virtuous and moral. Because Anyentyuwe's mother died when she was very young and Sonie's work kept him traveling, he placed her in the care of Mrs. Bushnell at the Mission at Baraka, a nearby American-run Protestant school. With the death of Anyentyuwe's father when she was about 13, Mrs. Bushnell became her primary caregiver. She took Anyentyuwe's education very seriously and personally oversaw her studies. Because of this, Anyentyuwe was educated in a much more expansive variety of subjects than the other students, including History, Physiology, Composition and Math.  Work  When Anyentyuwe completed her studies, she began teaching at the Mission School. Before his death, her father had asked her to promise that she would maintain her virtue, and remain with the missionaries, and Anyentuwe took this promise seriously. She worked at the school for many years, for low wages, rationed food, and often being mistreated by the male American missionaries. Her work there only ended after she Anyentuwe reported being raped by 2 of the missionaries at the Mission. She was not believed, and was banished from the only place she'd called home since she was a small child. Later in life, she went to work as a personal nanny/nurse to the child of Robert Hamill Nassau, a renowned missionary doctor. Their relationship evolved into a deep friendship. When Dr. Nassau began authoring his books, Fetichism in West Africa and Tales out of School, Anyentyuwe became an incredibly valuable collaborator and contributor, with her firsthand knowledge about Gabonese spiritual practices and the early days of the Protestant mission in Gabon.  Personal life  Despite opportunities, Anyentyuwe never married. As a result of one of the rapes, she did get pregnant and give birth to a daughter, Iga, in 1882. She enjoyed the companionship and professional relationship she shared with her longtime friend mentioned above, Robert Hamill Nassau, but maintained that they never had any romantic ties.  Feminism  Throughout her time at the Mission, Anyentyuwe was challenged by the male missionaries. She was constantly required to \\"prove\\" her chasteness, and often spoke up about the misogynistic views on women's clothing and behavior expectations. It was uncommon for women to report any kind of harassment or rape in colonial Africa, and while her report was not prosecuted, just the act of her reporting it at all was very controversial. When she was working with Nasseu, their relationship was under constant scrutiny within the Protestant community, despite their continued assurance that they were close friends and professional colleagues; her outspoken denial of these accusations of sexual impropriety caused strife and gave her a rebellious reputation.

The storm caused widespread electric‚Äê and communication‚Äêgrid disturbances through large portions of North America as well as satellite disruptions. On August 4, 1972, the storm caused the accidental detonation of numerous U.S. naval mines near Haiphong, North Vietnam. The coronal cloud's transit time from the Sun to the Earth is the fastest ever recorded. Solar- terrestrial characteristics=Sunspot region= The most significant detected solar flare activity occurred from August 2 to August 11. Most of the significant solar activity emanated from active sunspot region McMath 11976 (MR 11976; sunspot regions being clusters of sunspot pairs). McMath 11976 was extraordinarily magnetically complex. Its size was large although not exceptionally so. McMath 11976 produced 67 solar flares (4 of these X-class) during the time it was facing Earth, from July 29 to August 11. It also produced multiple relatively rare white light flares over multiple days. The same active area was long-lived. It persisted through five solar rotation cycles, first receiving the designation as Region 11947 as it faced Earth, going unseen as it rotated the far side of the Sun, then returning Earthside as Region 11976, before cycling as Regions 12007, 12045, and 12088, respectively. =Flare of August 4=Electromagnetic effects The August 4 flare which triggered the extreme solar particle event (SPE) around and intense geomagnetic storm on Earth was among the largest documented by science. This flare saturated the Solrad 9 X-ray sensor at approximately X5.3 but was estimated to be in the vicinity of X20, the threshold of the very rarely reached R5 on the NOAA radio blackout space weather scale. A radio burst of 76,000 sfu was measured at 1 GHz. This was an exceptionally long duration flare, generating X-ray emissions above background level for more than 16 hours. Rare emissions in the gamma ray (\\\\gamma-ray) spectrum were detected for the first time, on both August 4 and August 7, by the Orbiting Solar Observatory (OSO 7). The broad spectrum electromagnetic emissions of the largest flare are estimated to total 1-5 x 1032 ergs in energy released. CMEs/coronal clouds The arrival time of the associated coronal mass ejection (CME) and its coronal cloud, 14.6 hours, remains the record shortest duration as of November 2018, indicating an exceptionally fast and typically geoeffective event (normal transit time is two to three days). A preceding series of solar flares and CMEs cleared the interplanetary medium of particles, enabling the rapid arrival in a process similar to the solar storm of 2012. Normalizing the transit times of other known extreme events to a standard 1 AU to account for the varying distance of the Earth from the Sun throughout the year, one study found the ultrafast August 4 flare to be an outlier to all other events, even compared to the great solar storm of 1859, the overall most extreme known solar storm which is also known as the \\"Carrington event\\". This corresponds to an ejecta speed of an estimated . The near Earth vicinity solar wind velocity may also be record-breaking and is calculated to have exceeded . The velocity was not directly measurable as instrumentation was off-scale high. Analysis of a Guam magnetogram indicated a shockwave traversing the magnetosphere at and astonishing sudden storm commencement (SSC) time of 62 s. Estimated magnetic field strength of 73-103 nT and electric field strength of >200 mV/m was calculated at 1 AU. Solar particle event Reanalysis based on IMP-5 (a.k.a. Explorer 41) space solar observatory data suggests that >10‚ÄêMeV ion flux reached 70,000 cm‚àí2 s‚àí1 sr‚àí1 bringing it near the exceedingly rarely reached NOAA S5 level on the solar radiation scale. Fluxes at other energy levels, from soft to hard, at >1 MeV, >30 MeV, and >60 MeV, also reached extreme levels, as well as inferred for >100 MeV. The particle storm led to northern hemisphere polar stratospheric ozone depletion of about 46% at altitude for several days before the atmosphere recovered and which persisted for 53 days at the lower altitude of . The intense solar wind and particle storm associated with the CMEs led to one of the largest decreases in cosmic ray radiation from outside the Solar System, known as a Forbush decrease, ever observed. Solar energetic particle (SEP) onslaught was so strong that the Forbush decrease in fact partially abated. SEPs reached the Earth's surface, causing a ground level event (GLE). Geomagnetic storm The August 4 flare and ejecta caused significant to extreme effects on the Earth's magnetosphere, which responded in an unusually complex manner. The disturbance storm time index (Dst) was only -125 nT, falling merely within the relatively common \\"intense\\" storm category. Initially an exceptional geomagnetic response occurred and some extreme storming occurred locally later (some of these possibly within substorms), but arrival of subsequent CMEs with northward oriented magnetic fields is thought to have shifted the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) from an initial southward to northward orientation, thus substantially suppressing geomagnetic activity as the solar blast was largely deflected away from rather toward Earth. An early study found an extraordinary asymmetry range of ‚âà450 nT. A 2006 study found that if a favorable IMF southward orientation were present that the Dst may have surpassed 1,600 nT, comparable to the 1859 Carrington event. Magnetometers in Boulder, Colorado, Honolulu, Hawaii, and elsewhere went off-scale high. Stations in India recorded geomagnetic sudden impulses (GSIs) of 301-486 nT. Estimated AE index peaked at over 3,000 nT and Kp reached 9 at several hourly intervals (corresponding to NOAA G5 level). The magnetosphere compressed rapidly and substantially with the magnetopause reduced to 4-5 RE and the plasmapause (boundary of the plasmasphere, or lower magnetosphere) reduced to 2 RE or less. This is a contraction of at least one half and up to two-thirds the size of the magnetosphere under normal conditions, to a distance of less than . Solar wind dynamic pressure increased to about 100 times normal, based upon data from Prognoz 1. Impacts= Spacecraft = Astronomers first reported unusual flares on August 2, later corroborated by orbiting spacecraft. On August 3, Pioneer 9 detected a shock wave and sudden increase in solar wind speed from approximately . A shockwave passed Pioneer 10, which was 2.2 AU from the Sun at the time. The greatly constricted magnetosphere caused many satellites to cross outside Earth's protective magnetic field, such boundary crossings into the magnetosheath lead to erratic space weather conditions and potentially destructive solar particle bombardment. The Intelsat IV F-2 communications satellite solar panel arrays power generation was degraded by 5%, about 2 years worth of wear. An on-orbit power failure ended the mission of a Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS II) satellite. Disruptions of Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) scanner electronics caused anomalous dots of light in the southern polar cap imagery. = Terrestrial effects and aurora = On August 4, an aurora shone so luminously that shadows were cast on the southern coast of the United Kingdom and shortly later as far south as Bilbao, Spain at magnetic latitude 46¬∞. Extending to August 5, intense geomagnetic storming continued with bright red (a relatively rare color associated with extreme events) and fast-moving aurora visible at midday from dark regions of the Southern Hemisphere. Radio frequency (RF) effects were rapid and intense. Blackouts commenced nearly instantaneously on the sunlit side of Earth on HF and other vulnerable bands. A nighttime mid-latitude E layer developed. Geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) were generated and produced significant electrical grid disturbances throughout Canada and across much of eastern and central United States, with strong anomalies reported as far south as Maryland and Ohio, moderate anomalies in Tennessee, and weak anomalies in Alabama and north Texas. The voltage collapse of 64% on the North Dakota to Manitoba interconnection would have been sufficient to cause a system breakup if occurring during high export conditions on the line, which would have precipitated a large power outage. Many U.S. utilities in these regions reported no disturbances, with presence of igneous rock geology a suspected factor, as well as geomagnetic latitude and differences in operational characteristics of respective electrical grids. Manitoba Hydro reported that power going the other way, from Manitoba to the U.S., plummeted 120 MW within a few minutes. Protective relays were repeatedly activated in Newfoundland. An outage was reported along American Telephone and Telegraph (now AT&T;)'s L4 coaxial cable between Illinois and Iowa. Magnetic field variations (dB/dt) of ‚âà800 nT/min were estimated locally at the time and the peak rate of change of magnetic field intensity reached >2,200 nT/min in central and western Canada, although the outage was most likely caused by swift intensification of the eastward electrojet of the ionosphere. AT&T; also experienced a surge of 60 volts on their telephone cable between Chicago and Nebraska. Exceeding the high-current shutdown threshold, an induced electric field was measured at 7.0 V/km. The storm was detected in low-latitude areas such as the Philippines and Brazil, as well as Japan. = Military operations = American naval mine (left) explodes in Haiphong during U.S. Navy minesweeping (March 1973) The U.S. Air Force's Vela nuclear detonation detection satellites mistook that an explosion occurred, but this was quickly dealt with by personnel monitoring the data in real-time. The U.S. Navy concluded, as shown in declassified documents, that the seemingly spontaneous detonation of dozens of Destructor magnetic-influence sea mines (DSTs) within about 30 seconds in the Hon La area (magnetic latitude ‚âà9¬∞) was highly likely the result of an intense solar storm. One account claims that 4,000 mines were detonated. It was known that solar storms caused terrestrial geomagnetic disturbances but it was as yet unknown to the military whether these effects could be sufficiently intense. It was confirmed as possible in a meeting of Navy investigators at the NOAA Space Environment Center (SEC) as well as by other facilities and experts. = Human spaceflight = Occurring between Apollo missions, the storm has long been chronicled within NASA. Apollo 16 had returned home in April, and the final Apollo mission was a Moon landing planned for the following December. Those inside an Apollo command module would be shielded from 90% of incoming radiation, which could still have exposed astronauts to radiation sickness if they were located outside the protective magnetic field of Earth, which was the case for much of a lunar mission. A moonwalker or one on EVA in orbit could have faced severe acute illness and potentially a nearly universally fatal dose. An enhanced risk of contracting cancer would have been unavoidable regardless of the location of astronauts or spacecraft. This is one of only a handful of solar storms occurring in the Space Age that could cause severe illness, and was the most hazardous thus far. Had the most intense solar activity of early August occurred during a mission it would have forced contingency measures up to an emergency return landing for medical treatment. Implications for heliophysics and society The storm was an important event in the field of heliophysics, the study of space weather, with numerous studies published in the next few years and throughout the 1970s and 1980s, as well as leading to several influential internal investigations and to significant policy changes. Almost fifty years after the fact, the storm was reexamined in an October 2018 article published in the American Geophysical Union (AGU) journal Space Weather. The initial and early studies as well as the later reanalysis studies were only possible due to initial monitoring facilities installed during the International Geophysical Year (IGY) in 1957-1958 and subsequent global scientific cooperation to maintain the data sets. That initial terrestrial data from ground stations and balloons was later combined with spaceborne observatories to form far more complete information than had been previously possible, with this storm being one of the first widely documented of the then young Space Age. It convinced both the military and NASA to take space weather seriously and accordingly devote resources to its monitoring and study. The authors of the 2018 paper compared the 1972 storm to the great storm of 1859 in some aspects of intensity. They posit that it was a Carrington‚Äêclass storm. Other researchers conclude that the 1972 event could have been comparable to 1859 for geomagnetic storming if magnetic field orientation parameters were favorable, or as a \\"failed Carrington-type storm\\" based on related considerations, which is also the finding of a 2013 Royal Academy of Engineering report.

That school had been originally constructed in 1900, then replaced in 1919 by a Rosenwald School, also known as Pearl River County Training School.

It was edited by B√©la Uitz and Alad√°r Komj√°t. They had previously been aligned with Lajos Kass√°k and his journaal MA. Whereas Kassak advocated an ideologically autonomous artistic avantgarde, Egys√©g advocated that artistic activity should be more closely aligned with other aspects of class struggle and was critical of a more individualistic approach. The first issue was illustrated with a fresco plan Uitz's Emberis√©g (Humanity), a work commenced in 1919 but soon abandoned when the Hungarian Soviet Republic was crushed by the White Terror. As his accompanying text explained, this work was created according to the principles advocated by Georg Lukacs and Iv√°n Hevesy, by which a future socialist culture should adapt the culture of the medieval period, whereby despite differing content, strong iconic forms could be used to instill a new world view. Uitz explained that the work illustrated a four part process of redemption moving from man's origin, through suffering and labour to a final redemption. Love played a central role in this.

Personal life Prince Yukanthor was born in 1860 (some sources say he was born in 1858) to either Preah Neang Brah Nan or Tep Soda Chan. He grew up in the Royal Palace in Phnom Penh as the oldest son of King Norodom, in a country more or less under French rule. A treaty signed 1863 between King Norodom and the French Admiral De La Grandiere made Cambodia its protectorate. But Norodom claimed that the French Admiral de la Grandi√®re had forced him into signing the treaty. In 1872, Yukanthor was made to cut his hair and become a monk. During 1884 the French started to lack resources to continue their colonization of Cambodia, and through administrative reforms they took control of financing resources like tax and likewise. Yukanthor got into a spat with Frenchman Lt. Radisson, who was accused of stealing one of Yukanthor's concubines, who was sold to the Prince by his father who was in a gambling debt. Yukanthor, who was critical against the French colonial rule in Cambodia due to the emergence of the new Cambodian middle class that the Royal Family was afraid would take power from them, sent a long memorandum to the French prime minister, campaign of publicity tour and when he visited France in 1900, he met the French journalist Jean Hess. Yukanthor was sent by his father, who was still upset about his blackmailing at the 1884 Thomson Convention. On July 11th, 1897, the King was also deprived of his gambling profits, and the royal family had an alliance with French anti-imperialist radicals. Yukanthor became an influential figure in Parisian society, where he was invited to many parties and dinners in which he expressed his views on French colonialism, even having to flee to Brussels at one pointTully, John Andrew. Cambodia Under the Tricolour: King Sisowath and the \\"mission Civilisatrice\\" 1904-1927, 26. This became known as the Yukanthor Affair. During an interview with Hess, Yukanthor spoke about the French government and the French public, and the colonial domination of his country, published in Le Figaro newspaper, and the article spread the news of the affair. Yukanthor was made fun of by the French for being a small and dark-skinned man (158cm tall), with a small head. Yukanthor's accusations were that the freely asked and granted protectorate of Cambodia had become a complete French colonial administration, that Norodom was forced to give up his power at gunpoint in 1884, that he was treated terribly by a Frenchman named de Verneville who abused his power with his mistress, the Mi-Ruong, that the Norodom \\"dynasty reigned for 3,000 years and has always cared for its people\\", and that the Cambodian \\"had become to slave inside the whims of (French) administrators\\". Yukanthor demanded the removal of the UM \\"who ran away before the enemy\\" in 1885, the Prime Minister, and Thiounn, secretary of the Council of Ministers, the latter two of which Yukanthor accused of being the \\"two main embezzlers of the country\\". His memorandum was sent to the President of the Council of Ministers, with a shorter one sent to the newspaper Le Matin and an even shorter one to Le Figaro. In the letter sent to Le Figaro, Yukanthor said that there were two types of Frenchmen, those in Metropolitan France and those in the colonies, that the French knew \\"nothing about the Cambodians and believe we are barbarians\\", that France wants to impose its civilization, but \\"my family has ruled over the Kingdom for thousands of years\\", that labor should not be a punishment for sins, that Buddhism made the King the father of the people and Cambodians form a united family, that \\"we have our 'slaves', but your workers have the freedom to starve\\", \\"you make an ostentatious display of items of destruction in universal exhibitions\\", and that when Norodom asked for French protection, he did not ask for administration or civilizationhttps://www.slideshare.net/mparsons101/30th-january-2014-1900-the- prince-yukanthor-affair-dr-henri-locard. The French authorities ordered Sihanouk to cable his son to come home to Cambodia, and but for the fear of becoming arrested, he travelled to Thailand via Algeria, and after being banished by the French in 1900, he lived in exile in Bangkok from 1913 until his death in 1934.Cambodia Historykhmerization.blogspot.com:A Biography of Prince Norodom Arun Yukanthor Yukanthor took the SMS Prinz Heinrich on the 26th of October, 1900, and stopped in Singapore. On September 27th, 1901, Norodom invited him back to Cambodia, a request that was refused. In 1926, the Governor-General gave him a small pension. King Norodom was heartbroken by what had happened to Yukanthor and his predecessor who traveled to France, Duong Chakr and retired to his palace in Phnom Penh. Some conspiracies claim that he secretly fled to Brussels instead and died later on. Before he died in 1904, King Norodom appointed his son, Prince Yukanthor, as heir apparent to the throne. But because of Yukanthor's fall-out with the French, the Governor General Doumer threatened to dethrone him, and although bitter and disappointed with Sisowath, he made him heir to the throne. Family Prince Yukanthor married four times, but finally settled with Princess Norodom Malika (1872‚Äì1951), who was his half sister, and they had four sons and five daughters, of which notable children include: Princess Pengpas Yukanthor (1892‚Äì1969), Princess Robangpas Yukanthor (born 1893), Princess Pingpeang Yukanthor (1894‚Äì1966), who later became an important political activist, and Prince Heanh Wachhiravongs (1896‚Äì1969).

The character is portrayed by Giacomo Gianniotti. Andrew is introduced as a new surgical intern at Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital at the end of the eleventh season, eventually obtaining the position of a resident in the thirteenth season. He becomes one of the few interns and residents in later seasons to have personal connections to the attending surgeons. Andrew struggles with the everyday life of being in a competitive profession, fitting in with his peers, and navigating personal relationships with his friends and colleagues. Gianniotti was cast in April 2015 and was promoted to series regular status in January 2016. For his performance, Gianniotti was nominated for two Golden Maple Awards in 2016. In 2018, Gianniotti reprised his role in the spin-off series Station 19 as a guest.  Development  On April 15, 2015, it was announced that Gianniotti was cast in an undisclosed role for the final two episodes of the eleventh season, with the possibility of recurring in the twelfth season. He was promoted to the main cast on January 8, 2016, midway through the twelfth season. The announcement of Gianniotti's casting and the character's introduction initially received backlash from some fans who felt that the character was meant to be a replacement for Derek Shepherd, a character that had recently been written off the series to accommodate the departure of actor Patrick Dempsey. However, Gianniotti denied that this was the case, saying, \\"I‚Äôm just a new character on the show. I‚Äôm not filling any void.\\" He also confirmed at the time that \\"Andrew won‚Äôt have any [romantic] intentions with Meredith [Grey] so fans don‚Äôt have to worry about any threat.\\" In the beginning, Gianniotti struggled with the technical aspects of acting out surgeries. \\"My first surgery went terribly because I didn‚Äôt know the protocol for so many things, and the other actors were laughing at me. I was just getting everything wrong. Like, once you‚Äôre in the OR, your hands have to be by your chest, otherwise you‚Äôre no longer sterile ‚Äî I just didn‚Äôt know that, or how to hold my instruments.\\" However, the lack of direction allowed for Gianniotti to \\"fill in the blanks\\" of the character on his own. \\"I think that [Andrew] is a very honest, genuine, passionate guy. He‚Äôs very driven ‚Äî I relate to him a lot ‚Äî and he knows he‚Äôs good at what he does. I think he‚Äôs more of an introvert and now he finds himself as an adult and maybe he‚Äôs rediscovering who he is as a man [and] how to date women.\\"  Background  When Andrea \\"Andrew\\" DeLuca was young, he and his mother moved to Wisconsin from Italy while his sister Carina stayed behind with their father, Vincenzo DeLuca. Vincenzo was a renowned, but corrupt and mentally unstable surgeon in their home country. After operating in a manic state and killing four patients, Vincenzo used his connections and money to avoid prosecution, prompting his wife to leave with Andrew. At some point, Andrew's mother returned to Italy to visit Carina, where she had a stroke and died. Both DeLuca siblings speak fluent Italian and English, but due to the different settings they grew up in, Carina has an Italian accent when she speaks English and Andrew has an English accent when speaking Italian. Before becoming a doctor, Andrew worked as an EMT straight out of high school. At some point, he dated future colleague Sam Bello. Their chaotic relationship was ultimately left unresolved when Andrew moved away. But in Season 13, Episode 1, after Alex beats up Andrew, Maggie says that she will call his parents because they ‚Äúknow her,‚Äù and then reveals to Meredith that DeLuca's mom never knew that Andrew and Maggie broke up, which is inconsistent with the storyline that is later told. When Meredith and DeLuca start a potential relationship in Season 15, Andrew says that Carina did not tell him his mother had died until after she died, which doesn't fit with the storyline in the beginning of Season 13, which implies DeLuca's parents are alive and together. Later in Season 15, they add the story of DeLuca's father's potential mental illness.  Storylines  The penultimate episode of the eleventh season \\"Time Stops\\" features the first appearance of Dr. Andrew DeLuca. In the episode, Andrew emerges from a rescue vehicle carrying patients from a tunnel collapse. At the hospital, he identifies himself as a surgeon and says that he was on his way to work at Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital when he saw the accident and joined the rescue. He quickly lends a hand in helping the victims and, because he is wearing a suit and seems confident in what he is doing, the other doctors assume that he is an attending. However, he is later revealed to be an intern, which causes the other interns to ostracize him. Alienated from the other interns, who believe that he posed as an attending and therefore do not want to share housing with him, Andrew ends up moving in with Arizona Robbins. He also briefly dates Maggie Pierce, the Chief of Cardiothoracic Surgery, but breaks up with her out of professional intimidation. Andrew later develops feelings for Jo Wilson and takes her home from the bar when she is too drunk to drive. After getting her to bed, Jo begins to remove her clothes and causes Andrew to fall on top of her just as her boyfriend Alex Karev walks in. Alex assumes that Andrew is taking advantage of Jo and beats him nearly to death. Andrew files felony charges against Alex, which causes unease with his bosses and colleagues, most of whom have longstanding friendships with Alex. Andrew tells Arizona, Alex's friend and mentor, that he would be willing to move out, but she rejects his offer. Just as Alex is about to go to jail, Andrew retracts the charges for Jo's sake. Andrew becomes a surgical resident as his ex-girlfriend, Sam Bello, arrives at the hospital as an intern. His sister Carina also joins the team at Grey Sloan and begins dating Andrew's roommate Arizona, much to Andrew's discomfort. Carina doesn't approve of Sam, whom she feels is a stalker. Andrew and Sam eventually rekindle their relationship until Sam leaves to avoid deportation. Heartbroken, Andrew drunkenly kisses Meredith Grey at Jo and Alex's wedding. He then realizes that his feelings for Meredith are genuine and begins to pursue her. After months of chasing her, Andrew begins a relationship with Meredith. When Andrew's father, Vincenzo, shows up at the hospital to do research on an external womb, Andrew signs onto the project to further his surgical career. However, he soon realizes that his father's mental illness is getting in the way just as it did in the past. After the project fails, Andrew has an emotional confrontation with Vincenzo, who then departs Seattle. As his and Meredith's relationship deepens, Andrew tells her he loves her and takes the fall for her insurance fraud to prove it, landing him in prison. When Meredith visits him in jail, she says she loves him too and vows to get him out. Once Meredith turns herself in, Andrew is released from prison and rehired at Grey Sloan. He supports Meredith through her court-mandated community service as the status of her medical license hangs in the air. During her hearing, he speaks about the nature of their relationship and, upon hearing her talk about Derek, realizes she doesn‚Äôt respect him the way she did Derek. He asks her to take some time to think about what she wants, and though they briefly reconcile their relationship, he breaks up with her for good when she expresses concern about him showing signs of mania possibly brought on by bipolar disease. In the aftermath of their breakup, Andrew appears to be continuing down a spiral, worrying Carina, who recognizes the similarities in Andrew‚Äôs behavior to that of their father‚Äôs.  Reception  Despite initial skepticism, the character has been received positively. Rebecca Farley of Refinery29 described DeLuca's reputation as \\"passionate, handsome, and a bit of an idiot.\\" She also cited the fact that the intern had remained on the show after multiple seasons as proof that the \\"Rhimesian jury\\" had ruled in his favor, affirming the character's likability. Elite Dailys Rachel Chapman called the character \\"charming\\" and said that \\"he truly handles stuff like a pro.\\" In 2016, Gianniotti was nominated for Best Actor in a TV Series Broadcast in the U.S. and Newcomer of the Year in a TV Series Broadcast in the U.S. at the Golden Maple Awards.

It served as the high school for black students until the public schools were integrated in 1970. History=Early history= Colored School Number 4 Delray opened in 1896 and closed in 1907. In 1914, William Robinson wrote to Booker T. Washington for advice on how to get the school reopened. At Washington's request, Clarence Walker came to an abandoned schoolhouse in Delray and opened the Delray County Training School using the Smith-Hughes National Vocational Education Act of 1917, which was devised to encourage agricultural training. From 1922 to 1957, Solomon Spady served as teacher and principal. Spady, a student of George Washington Carver, was also recommended by Washington. In 1937, the school was renamed George Washington Carver High School and expanded to include grades 1 through 12. The first 12th grade graduation came in 1939. Agriculture was an important part of the curriculum, and the students farmed a 10-acre plot adjacent to the school and sold the produce to the public. The school moved to its current location in 1958, and the old campus became S. D. Spady Elementary School. A Montessori magnet program, intended to bring white students to the predominantly black school, has been in place at the elementary school since 1989. =After integration= In 1970, the school was merged with the all-white Seacrest High School to form Atlantic Community High School. The old high school became George Washington Carver Middle School. When a new middle school serving Delray Beach opened in 1994, the Carver name was transferred to it. The old campus was renamed the Delray Full Service Center. Buildings on the campus later fell into such disrepair that the Palm Beach County School District decided to tear them down. In response to the proposed demolition, graduates formed a Preservation Society, which has lobbied officials and raised money to preserve Building #1 (the classrooms and administrative building), building #12, the cafetorium, and the gym, called The Hangar because it looked like an airplane hangar. Solomon Spady's house on Northwest 5th Avenue was the first residence on the west side of Swinton Avenue to have electricity and plumbing and now serves as a center of African-American history. It is called the Spady Cultural Heritage Museum. Athletics Carver competed in the Florida Interscholastic Athletic Association, winning two state championships in football. In 1947, Carver was the first black school in the state to host a track meet.

The second is a personal retirement scheme in which the individual has contributed to the plan rather than an employer. The majority of the population is employed in the manufacturing and service sector with a unionized public sector. This results in the occupational retirement scheme being the most popular. Currently only 20.51% of Malta's current population as of 2018 is 65 years of age or old qualifying for pension schemes.

Motivated by the Southport and St Anne's lifeboats disaster, he founded in 1891, under the auspices of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, the Lifeboat Saturday Movement to provide charity for the widows and orphans of drowned crew members. Marion Macara assisted him and founded the Ladies Lifeboat Guild. He directed the Lifeboat Saturday Movement, throughout the United Kingdom, until 1896.

Raka Levajac was remarkably close to both uprising leaders, Obrenoviƒá and Karadjordje, before falling out of grace with each of them. A celebrated leader at a time he died in poverty after losing status and fortune. Early life Raka Levajac was born in 1777 in Leva, he had two brothers Panta and Radosav, little is known of his father who dies when he was young; his mother Jelenka remarried and Raka and his two brothers followed her to the village of Gornje Gorevnica at the beginning of 1800. Raka started working with Nikola Lunjevica a merchant and cattle trader. Lunjevica played a significant role in the life of Raka Levajac, thanks to his financial assistance Levajac began to trade cattle on his own dealing with Zemun merchants, supplying food and livestock to the Austrian army, thus increasing his reputation and wealth; through his trade, he also met fellow livestock merchant Karaƒëorƒëe and the brothers Milan and Milo≈° Obrenoviƒá. First Serbian Uprising A depiction of the Battle of Dublje on 26 July 1815; in the battle, Raka Levajac distinguished himself. In 1804 Raka Levajac responded to Karadjordje's call for an uprising and participated in the Ostru≈ænica Assembly, the first national assembly of Serbia taking place from May 6 to May 15, 1804. The Assembly discussed the development of the uprising, the organization of the uprising government and the acquisition of weapons. Raka Levajac was part of Karadjordje's delegation at the negotiations with the Turks in Zemun in 1804. The negotiations were held under the auspices of Austria, from April 28 to May 10, 1804. Karadjordje appeared with sixteen selected Serbian envoys including Raka Levajac as the representative of Western Pomoravlje. He participated in the battles on Mi≈°ar (1806) and Ljubiƒá.

She was sometimes billed as Stella Steele. Early years Hammerstein was the daughter of Oscar Hammerstein I and Malvina Jacobi Hammerstein, both of whom initially opposed her going into show business as a profession. In 1908, she told a New York Times reporter of her father's reaction when, at age 20, she told him that she was going into musical comedy: \\"Papa without more ado piled me over his knee and applied the hairbrush vigorously.\\" Eventually he accepted her desire to be an actress. Career In 1902, Hammerstein joined the stock theater company headed by Daniel Frohman. She debuted on January 7 of that year in Frocks and Frills. In 1904, she went to London to study drama and soon joined an opera company. Her stay was cut short when her father ordered her home as a way of breaking up a romantic relationship that she had developed with a magazine publisher. She returned to London in April 1907 to join one of the theatrical companies of George Joseph Edwardes. In 1908, she returned to the United States to perform in George M. Cohan's The Yankee Prince when it had its premiere in Hartford, Connecticut. Hammerstein's hopes of eventually singing grand opera and becoming a prima donna were dashed when her father's throat specialist told her in 1908 that her vocal cords were \\"much too weak for really great music\\". Hammerstein's Broadway credits included Everywoman (1911), The American Idea (1908), The Yankee Prince (1908), Winsome Winnie (1903), The Blonde in Black (1903), Notre Dame (1902), and Frocks and Frills (1902). She also appeared in On the Eve at the Hollis Street Theatre in Boston in 1909. She initiated her vaudeville career in 1912 in a playlet, The Tyranny of Fate, in Atlantic City. The following year, she co-authored Getting the Goods, a play for vaudeville. Hammerstein appeared in the films The Ace of Death (1915), Anna Karenina (1915), and Social Hypocrites (1918). Hammerstein Amusement Company In September 1919, approximately two months after the death of their father, Hammerstein and her sister, Rose Hammerstein Tostevain, became owners of the Hammerstein Amusement Company. A judge of the Supreme Court of the State of New York ruled that the two daughters were the rightful owners of 4,998 shares of the company's total of 5,000 shares of stock. The ownership had been the subject of a legal dispute involving the sisters, Oscar Hammerstein's widow, and a trust company with which the shares had been deposited as security for alimony payments to Oscar Hammerstein's first wife. Personal life On October 5, 1912, Hammerstein married Frederick Lionel Chester Keating, an attorney, in Jersey City. They were divorced in March 1920, and on April 1, 1920, she married Charles Fyles Pope, vice-president of the International Doll Association.

It was a racially segregated public black-only high school during the Jim Crow era, and was in operation from 1949 to 1967. History The segregated black \\"Negro\\" public schools in Flagler County, Florida, prior to 1949, only went through the eighth grade. Although Flagler County provided the racially segregated white- only Bunnell High School, which was in operation from the founding of the county in 1917, blacks were forbidden to attend. Flagler County did not provide a high school for blacks for 32 years (from its founding in 1917 until 1949 when the George Washington Carver High School was built).Jaye, Randy. Perseverance: Episodes of Black History from the Rural South. Kindle Direct Publishing, 2020. George Washington Carver High School closed after the 1967 school year (13 years after the Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka decision). Black high school students were integrated with white students at Bunnell High School, which was formally a white-only school. From the 1968 through the 1970 school year Bunnell High School served as the only high school in Flagler County. During the summer of 1970, a fire damaged the Bunnell High School building, which forced its closure. The George Washington Carver High School (building) re-opened for the 1971 school year and all of Flagler County‚Äôs high school students, black and white, attended school here until the end of the 1974 school year. However, the George Washington Carver High School‚Äôs name was changed to Bunnell High School from 1971 through 1974. In 1974, the Flagler Palm Coast High School was completed and the George Washington Carver High School building (now named Bunnell High School) was closed, and would not open as a high school ever again. Although the rest of the school buildings have been torn down, the gym remains and is known as the Carver Center. Efforts by the county commission to tear the gym down in 2010 resulted in backlash from the community as well as the school board, and it was instead refurbished and ownership returned to the school system. The George Washington Community Center facility [which is now housed in the former George Washington Carver School gymnasium building] and is owned by Flagler County. The George Washington Carver Foundation, which is a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization works to raise money and grant funding to support the facility. The George Washington Community Center facility offers community training (including a GED program), recreation and athletics with scheduled open gym hours available for the public. = George Washington Carver Center - Exterior Picture Gallery = File:G.W._Carver_Center_- _West_Exterior_View.jpgG.W.

The Normal School specialized in training young men in music education for Catholic boys' schools, while Pio Nono was a business school. School for the deaf St. John's School for the Deaf was founded as part of Pio Nono in 1876 as the Catholic Deaf and Dumb Asylum. In its first year, the 17 students classes were held in the second floor of the Pio Nono gymnasium. A separate building for the school was completed in the summer of 1879 and dedicated in December of that year. From 1889-1895 it operated as the coeducational St. John's Institute for Deaf Mutes. In 1895, the institute became a fully independent school, and was no longer an entity within Pio Nono College.

In 1941, the high school was combined with minor seminary students transferred over from Saint Francis de Sales Seminary to form St. Francis Minor Seminary (1941-1963), later De Sales Preparatory Seminary (1963-1970), a four-year high school and junior college.

Responding to criticism online, Hashmi, then a 19-year-old student at the university of Colorado, created a 712-page online spreadsheet with specific examples of Muslims condemning terrorist actions. As of November 2018, the spreadsheet had over 6000 entries and was still available and editable online. With the help of Nigerian developers Ire Aderinokun and Timi Ajiboye, she turned it into a website, Muslims Condemn. The website won her the Yaqeen Institute for Islamic Research's Muhammad Ali Confident Muslim Award in 2017. It is now being integrated into The Bridge Project, a Georgetown initiative to combat Islamophobia. Hashmi sees her faith as complementary to her activism stating \\"\\"Social justice is a huge part of being a Muslim, but it also doesn't affect the actions I have to take as a Muslim, when it comes to prayer and fasting and going to the pilgrimage.\\" Hashmi has also been involved in organizing real-life events. These include a 200-person protest at the Denver International Airport following the signing of an executive order by Donald Trump banning citizens of seven primarily Muslim countries from entering the United States, as well as a silent walkout when Ann Coulter came to speak on campus and an interfaith Walk for Unity. In 2017 she was the co-president of the Muslim Student Association at the University of Colorado in Boulder where she studies molecular biology.

Established in 1898, the museum houses a collection of over 80,000 objects from various regions in Northern India.  Description = History = In 1889, a proposal for the foundation of an archaeology museum in the Indian city of Srinagar was formulated by Amar Singh and S.H. Godmerry. Singh was an officer in the Colonial Indian Army, while Godmerry was a scholar. The pair produced and submitted a memorandum to Pratap Singh of Jammu and Kashmir, the ruler of Sringar and Amar's older brother. The Majarah accepted the proposal and agreed to allow for the establishment of a museum; this new institution would house artifacts from Jammu, Kashmir, Baltistan and Gilgit. The museum was to be located inside a state-owned building near the Jhelum river. The establishment of the museum was overseen by John Marshal, a British archaeologist (and future director of the Archaeological Survey of India) who was renowned for his work in preserving the archaeological history of India. Srinagar's Accountant General, one Mr. Blerjee, was appointed as the first president of the museum; Blerjee was also tasked with recording a large collection of coins the museum added to its collection. The museum opened to the public in 1898, with its first collection consisting of items from Majarah Pratap's palace treasury. Following the re- organizational efforts of Indian archaeologist Daya Ram Sahni in 1913, the museum received objects recovered from archaeological excavations in Panderenthan, Parihaspora and Avantipura. The collection of the museum continued to grow through the donation of items by private collectors; many of these items were domestic or household in nature.Valley‚Äôs lone museum opens to public.
