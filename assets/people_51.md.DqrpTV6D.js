This arrangement of the trees is a result of a local man trying to impress his girlfriend Nellie around 1920. It has since become locally famous and is the site of numerous marriage proposals. The trees won the 2018 English and British Tree of the Year awards and came ninth in the 2019 European Tree of the Year awards.  History  Detail of the \\"N\\" for Nellie (2018 photograph) Though referred to as \\"the tree\\" in the singular form it is actually three separate beech trees that have been grafted together. Around 1920 a young miner and keen amateur gardener, Vic Stead, resided in Garforth. He regularly made the trip to Aberford by foot along the \\"Fly-line\\", a disused colliery railway, to see his girlfriend Nellie who worked there as a dairy maid. Near to Aberford Stead found three beech saplings growing in a row and grafted the central tree onto the two adjacent ones in a diagonal fashion to form the shape of the capital letter \\"N\\". This was intended as a gesture of his love for Nellie and as a means of impressing her. It was apparently successful in this regard as the couple later married. The tree is known as the \\"Love Tree\\" locally and has become a popular site for marriage proposals. Writer Richard Mabey has described it as \\"one of the most touching twentieth- century landmark trees\\" in his 1996 work Flora Britannica and The Woodland Trust have called it a \\"northern gem\\". Nellie's Tree has become the symbol of the Save Parlington Action Group, a local campaign against development of the woodland.  Tree of the Year  Vic and Nellie have both since died but their grandson nominated the tree into the Woodland Trust's Tree of the Year competition in 2018. He had become aware of the tree during walks in the woods with his grandparents who pointed it out and told the story behind it. The tree was selected by a panel of experts to be represented on the 10-strong shortlist put to the public vote. The tree won the English round of the competition, garnering 2,351 votes - the most of any tree in the four national competitions ‚Äì and received a ¬£1000 tree care grant from the People's Postcode Lottery. As a result of winning the English competition the tree was put forwards with the other national winners into the British competition, run in conjunction with the BBC's The One Show. The tree won the vote and was named British Tree of the Year. The tree came ninth in the 2019 European Tree of the Year awards.

It is Sensible's fifth studio solo album and contains 32 songs across two and a half hours. The album includes studio performances by Sensible's band - featuring ex-Damned bassist Paul Gray, keyboardist Malcolm Dixon and drummer Garrie Dreadful - as well as demo recordings and instrumentals recorded mostly by Sensible on his own.  Background  Sensible writes in the album's liner notes: \\"If The Universe of Geoffrey Brown was my Sgt. Pepper, then this collection of goodies is probably The White Album.... warts and all!\\" Meathead was recorded in a \\"full on experimentation mode\\", where \\"nothing was off limits\\", according to Sensible. He described the album as \\"a mixed bag of stuff including studio performances by my band, cosmic instrumentals, weird (but genuine) clips from radio and admittedly some dodgy demos that have a certain gnarled charm (ie.... too lazy to re-record).\\" \\"Freedom\\" and \\"Pasties\\" were originally released in 1991 on the 12\\" and CD- single versions of the Damned's \\"Fun Factory\\" single.  Critical reception  In a review for AllMusic, Richie Unterberger called Meathead \\"a sprawling mess of a record\\", saying that Sensible \\"seems to be taking a Zappa-like approach to his work with his combination of so many elements: bouncy London pop, Pink Floydish spacy electronics, found sound bites from TV shows, grating bulldozer guitar riffs, dainty orchestral violins, and silly lyrics about space travel. Often he seems to want to shock or jolt the listener out of complacency with repeated monster guitar licks or spoken dialogue; if the goal is to irritate, he succeeds all too well ... The listener ends up being not so much dazzled as exhausted, or worse, fed up with his apparent value of cocky experimentation over cogent, humane statements.\\"  Track listing  Personnel  Credits adapted from the album's liner notes. ;Musicians *Captain Sensible - vocals, guitar, keyboards *Malcolm Dixon - keyboards, guitar, vocals, lead vocals (\\"Crazy Fish\\", \\"Love Thing\\", \\"Inventing the Wheel\\", \\"Aliens ?

Early life and family Dena Lesley Vane was born on 1 May 1944 to Ronald Vane, a soldier in the British Army, and his wife Phyllis, a cinema usherette. Her father died when she was two but her mother subsequently married his brother, Leslie, whom she had met at Ronald's funeral.Dena Vane-Kirkman obituary. The Times, 8 November 2018. She was educated at Barton Peveril Grammar School where she was head girl. Career Vane-Kirkman's career in the media began with a secretarial job on the Daily Express in London where she worked for the motoring correspondent Basil Cardew and the industrial editor Sir Trevor Evans. She became a reporter and then women's editor for the local Hendon Times where she met her husband Peter Kirkman whom she married in 1965 becoming Dena Vane-Kirkman. Professionally, she remained Dena Vane. The couple had two children. She became a sub-editor on Woman and then deputy editor of Home and Freezer Digest which she revamped so that it outsold Good Housekeeping. She applied the same formula at Living magazine where she moved it away from housekeeping and cookery towards features on relationships, sex, and women's health.\\"Living sheds its clone image\\", Marketing, Vol. 20 (1985), p. 10. According to Ronnie Lessem, however, her attempts to include business coverage were thwarted by men who saw traditional women's subjects as more profitable.Meet the Founders of Integral Economics.

Her marriage ended at that time. She introduced new titles such as In Touch and Life and Style and took the firm's portfolio from two to nine titles. As in the U.K., she changed the content to address more contemporary issues. She was one of a number of British women who made careers editing American women's magazines at that time and her contemporaries included Tina Brown at Vanity Fair and Eve Pollard at Elle.

Personal life  Born Susan Hutchinson Adams in Missouri in 1835, the daughter of John Adams and Mary Gill, she was educated at Fielding Institute, Lindonwood College and Fulton Female College in Missouri and taught school in Jackson, Mississippi in 1865. She married Cornelius Lewis Neville Vaughan in San Francisco, California in 1876. Her husband died in 1893 and she moved to Arlington, VA to live with her sister Sallie Adams. Vaughan attempted to capitalize on her claim by copyrighting a couple of drawings she made in 1908 and selling them as postcards. Aged and destitute, she applied to the Masonic and Eastern Star home for the District of Columbia and was admitted in 1909 and died there in 1911. Vaughan is buried at Mount Olivet United Methodist Church in Arlington, VA.  Claim to fame  Vaughan claimed to have started the Memorial Day holiday on April 26, 1865. This date and her name appear on the southeast portion of the Confederate Monument in Jackson, Mississippi. Briefly, the story goes that Vaughan (Adams, at the time) was at a friend‚Äôs home north of Jackson, Mississippi on the night of April 25, 1865. Around midnight, two couriers arrive to tell them that their army is on the verge of surrender. Vaughan grabs a pencil and scrap of paper to write a plea to the \\"daughters of the Southland\\" to garland the graves of the dead soldiers the next day. The note is pinned to the jacket of one of the couriers who rushes to the newspaper office to have it printed in the next day‚Äôs paper. The following morning everyone meets at the cemeteries and the graves are heaped with flowers, starting the Memorial Day holiday. She apparently wrote several similar versions of the story. The Mississippi Archives preserves a letter Vaughan wrote in 1897 describing the circumstances surrounding her inauguration of the holiday. Many of the details differ from another version of the story published in the Confederate Veteran magazine in 1898. In their book, The Genesis of the Memorial Day Holiday in America, Bellware and Gardiner take issue with Vaughan‚Äôs claim. There is no contemporaneous evidence of her actions, despite claiming that she wrote her appeal in the Mississippian newspaper and no record of any witnesses to corroborate her story. In addition, the details she describes do not match the historical record of the surrender of General Taylor to General Canby at the War‚Äôs end. Her story is similar to the verifiable account of Mary Ann Williams. Williams wrote a letter to the press in March 1866 that was reprinted throughout the South. She proposed an annual decoration custom starting on April 26, 1866, the anniversary of Johnston's surrender to Sherman. Vaughan's claim was determined to be just one of the many hoaxes that arose to explain the origin of the holiday.

The fire ignited on November 8, 2018 and burned of land. The fire destroyed 1,643 structures, killed three people, and prompted the evacuation of more than 295,000 people. It was one of several fires in California that ignited on the same day. While the nearby Hill Fire was contained with minimal damage on November 16, the Camp Fire in Northern California destroyed most of the town of Paradise, killing 86 people. The fire started in Woolsey Canyon on the Santa Susana Field Laboratory property, a complex of industrial research and development belonging to Boeing, in the Santa Susana Mountains above the Simi Valley near the boundary between Los Angeles and Ventura counties. The Santa Ana winds, which often are a factor for Southern California fires, pushed the fire in a southerly direction throughout the first day. The Ventura freeway between the San Fernando Valley and the Conejo Valley was closed as the fire crossed and headed into the rugged Santa Monica Mountains. The fire raced through the chaparral-covered steep canyons where it encountered historic movie and TV sets, small ranches, and the houses of celebrities. Hundreds of houses in Malibu were destroyed or damaged on both sides of Pacific Coast Highway. Many of these were on Point Dume that juts out from the narrow coastal terrace that lies between the mountains and the Pacific Ocean. While the firefighters successfully protected Pepperdine University to the south, the entire portion of the Malibu coast west to the community of Solromar suffered damage from the fire. The fire cost at least $6 billion (2018 USD) in property damage. Thousands of residents were kept away from their houses in numerous neighborhoods along the Ventura Freeway and the communities along the Malibu coast. The evacuations frustrated residents as they lasted for many days as the fire continued to threaten houses especially when the winds increased and fanned the flames. The evacuated residents were incrementally allowed to return to see if their houses were damaged or destroyed as the fire continued to spread through the rugged wilderness at the western end of the Santa Monica Mountains. Authorities in many of the damaged communities declared that they needed to prevent residents from returning quickly as neighborhoods were crowded with crews repairing downed power lines and other hazardous conditions. In the months after the fire, people criticized what they thought was a slow and inadequate response by cities and counties during public meetings held by public officials. While this and other fires were burning, President Donald Trump blamed poor forest management by the state. Fire scientists explained that forest management (good or bad) had a minor influence on the severity of the fires, and that Woolsey was not a forest fire. The California Public Utilities Commission is investigating an equipment problem near the point of origin reported by Southern California Edison.  Timeline  At 2:22 p.m. PST on Nov 8, Southern California Edison reported an outage on the Big Rock 16 kV circuit out of the Chatsworth substation on the Santa Susana Field Laboratory property, south of Simi Valley, Ventura County, California. At 2:24 p.m. PST a brush fire was reported in the same location. The first firefighters arrived almost 20 minutes later due to complications of resources because of the nearby Hill Fire. The nearest fire crew, part of a private company contracted to protect Santa Susana Field Laboratory, a Boeing Company facility nearby, was delayed by its engine breaking down. Powerful Santa Ana winds, reaching , caused the fire to spread rapidly and beyond firefighting capabilities. During the overnight hours into the early morning of November 9, the fire crossed U.S. Route 101 near Calabasas and spread through Liberty Canyon in Agoura Hills. Aerial suppression of the fire was unable to commence until 5:00 a.m. PST, November 9, when winds lessened enough. On the morning of November 9, Assistant L.A. County Fire Chief Williams told KBUU-LP that his request for 70 strike teams had been denied. The blaze spread rapidly throughout the day burning through the mountains and along the 101 Freeway, eventually reaching Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu by the afternoon devastating numerous houses there. Firefighters and firetrucks who did not know the area were reported idle by many frustrated citizens. Several homeowners stayed despite the mandatory evacuation to defend their houses. Pepperdine University in Malibu recommended that students shelter in place in specific buildings on campus rather than use the crowded highway to evacuate. Farther north, the flames spread to portions of Thousand Oaks, Bell Canyon, Westlake Village, Oak Park and the West Hills neighborhood of Los Angeles forcing residential evacuations and the closure of numerous business and corporate offices in the region. On the day before the Hill and Woolsey fires started, residents in the Conejo Valley experienced the shooting of thirteen people in a bar including a police officer and the perpetrator. As the fires threatened the community and otherwise disrupted their routine, memorial services had to be postponed. By November 9, Cal Fire and the United States Forest Service were also helping local services with the fire. This resulted in 3,242 firefighters being deployed to contain the blaze by the morning of November 10. The fire had engulfed more than of land, forcing the evacuation of an estimated 295,000 people from 105,000 residences. This included an unprecedented total evacuation of Bell Canyon, Malibu, Agoura Hills, Malibou Lake, and Oak Park. Before sunrise on November 14, the fire flared up in rugged wilderness at the western end of the Santa Monica Mountains with winds blowing strongly. The fire burned well away from populated neighborhoods, but was threatening scattered home sites. The flare- up sent a huge column of smoke over Point Mugu and out to sea. By November 21 at 6:11 p.m. PST, the fire was 100% contained.  Impacts  Satellite image of the fire on November 9. The majority of western Malibu is engulfed by smoke and fire at the time of this image, with the blaze spreading into Thousand Oaks. Many of the public and private parks and trails within the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area were closed indefinitely as damage due to the fire was being evaluated and necessary remediation measures were put in place. Closures included Malibu Creek State Park and Zuma Beach. Property owned by the federal government within the national recreation area includes some developed parks and large undeveloped tracts of land. The fire caused trails to be shut for months as 88% of the federal parkland was burned. The fire created a challenge to native plants as black mustard with bright yellow flowers quickly established itself post-fire. Two people were found dead in a vehicle on Mulholland Highway in Malibu. Emergency personnel were unable to reach the victims when a report of a critical burn victim was relayed, due to downed power lines. On Tuesday November 13, a third victim was discovered in the 32000 block of Lobo Canyon Road in Agoura Hills. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department announced on January 22, 2019 that charred human remains had been found in the burn area in Malibu and that homicide detectives were trying to determine if the victim had been killed in the flames or had met with foul play. At least 1600 houses were destroyed by the fire. Many celebrities are among those who lost their houses, including Kim Basinger, Tracey E. Bregman, Gerard Butler, Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth, Scott Derrickson, Shannen Doherty, Fred Durst, Joe Flanigan, Mike Garson, Camille Grammer, Daryl Hannah and Neil Young, Gabe Kapler, Catherine Oxenberg, Lil Pump, Robin Thicke, Andrew von Oeyen and Eric Wynalda. Multiple filming locations and historical sites were directly impacted by the fire, including Paramount Ranch, Peter Strauss Ranch, the former Reagan Ranch now part of Malibu Creek State Park, and the lower house of Villa De La Vina, the mansion where The Bachelor and The Bachelorette are filmed. The numerous drug rehabilitation centers and sober living houses in Malibu that have given rise to the nickname \\"Rehab Riviera\\" were evacuated ahead of the fire. At least two were destroyed or significantly damaged. Three Jewish summer camps JCA Shalom, Gindling Hilltop, and camp Hess Kramer were all almost completely devastated in the fire too. There have been two cases of looting in Ventura County, one of which resulted in a car chase. Reporters and officials rescued animals from houses, and brought them to shelters and vets. Other animals at locations such as Malibu Wines were either evacuated or cared for at the locations. Local fire officials opened Zuma Beach as an evacuation point for large animals, with pictures by the Los Angeles Times, showing llamas, alpacas, and horses tied to lifeguard stations and poles. Responses On November 10, President Donald Trump, stated poor forest management by the state of California as the cause of the Woolsey Fire and the concurrent Camp Fire. In a controversial tweet, the President threatened to end federal assistance unless the state improves its \\"gross mismanagement of the forests.\\" The small groves of California sycamores and coast live oaks amidst the sage and chaparral covered hillsides in the area of the fire are not considered to be forests as commonly understood by the public or wildfire experts. Since these small, critical habitats are not logged, President Trump's statements had little relevance to the Southern California fire. The firemens' union disagreed with President Trump's claims, noting that California experienced unusually dry conditions and abnormally high fire danger at the time. Brian Rice, president of the California Professional Firefighters, described Trump's assertion about the state's forest management practices as \\"dangerously wrong,\\" noting that 60 percent of California forests are directly managed by the federal government, which has reduced spending on forestry in recent years.Tweet by Jose Del Real, November 10, 2018 =In public meetings= In public meetings, people affected by the fire were critical of the slow and inadequate response of the Los Angeles County Fire Department, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and California Highway Patrol and their poor handling of the evacuation, and the city of Malibu and their lack of preparation and overall response during and after the fire. Government investigations California Public Utilities Commission launched a probe into Southern California Edison who reported a problem with a transmission grid at the point of origin two minutes before the start of the fire. A 2019 Los Angeles County report on missteps in the government's handling of the Woolsey Fire response (the 'Woolsey Report') cited the unavailability of firefighting units in Western Malibu during critical times of the fire, where hundreds of houses were lost. The report stated: \\"a significant number of requests by political figures to check on specific addresses of homes to ensure their protection distracted from Department leadership to accomplish priority objectives\\" which included a personal request to the city fire chief by Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti. Amidst the coronavirus pandemic in March 2020, Alex Villanueva, Los Angeles County Sheriff, was removed from his position as head of county emergency operations by the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors due to the poor emergency response reported by investigators in the Woolsey Report.

She and her common-law husband, Italian-born Rocco Perri, established a business in bootlegging after the sale and distribution of alcohol was prohibited in both Canada and the United States. Starkman dealt mainly with the finances of the business. Early and family life Bessie Starkman was born in Poland on June 21, 1890, to Shimon and Gello Starkman; she was a Polish Jew. Starkman immigrated to Canada circa 1900, settled in The Ward, Toronto, Ontario with her parents, and married Harry Toben by the age of 18. She had two daughters with Toben, Gertrude and Lilly. In 1912, Starkman met Rocco Perri, an Italian immigrant, while he lived as a boarder in her family home. The two began an affair shortly after, and when Perri got a job working on the Welland Canal in 1913, Starkman left her family and moved in with him in St. Catharines to begin a common-law relationship. When the Canadian government cut funding to the Welland Canal project due to World War I, Perri became unemployed. After working in a bakery, he was hired as a salesman for the Superior Macaroni Company. However, Perri and Starkman found a source of income when the Ontario Temperance Act came into effect on 16 September 1916, which restricted the sale and distribution of alcohol. The couple began bootlegging; using Starkman's business acumen and Perri's connections, they established a profitable enterprise. By this time the two lived in Hamilton, Ontario, and by 1920, moved into a larger home at 166 Bay Street South. In 1918, Perri began an affair with Sarah Olive Routledge, with whom he had two daughters. After his first child was born, Perri had refused to marry Routledge, but he did maintain a home for her in St. Catharines and paid child support. Their affair resumed in 1920. Perri's job as a macaroni salesman required travel across Ontario; he also used those trips to arrange the sale of liquor. Starkman, busy running the finances for their organization, did not question Perri's outings. In February 1922, Routledge was falsely told by Perri's lawyer that he was already married to Starkman. Despondent, Routledge committed suicide by jumping from her lawyer's seventh- story office window of the Bank of Hamilton; her parents took custody of their children. Criminal operations Perri and Starkman survived financially in the few years after 1915 from his income as a macaroni salesman and their grocery store on Hess Street. After the Ontario Temperance Act was passed in 1916, making the sale of alcohol illegal, the couple started selling shots of Canadian whisky on the side. Their bootlegging was done on a small scale, with their kitchen as the centre of operations. Bootlegging became a much larger and more profitable enterprise when Prohibition was declared in Canada nationwide on April 1, 1918 and the Eighteenth Amendment that prohibited sale of alcohol in the United States in 1920. Through the 1920s, Perri became the leading figure in organized crime in Southern Ontario and was under constant surveillance by police. The government allowed for numerous exceptions, allowing various breweries and distilleries to remain open for the export market. Starkman was the head of operations and the duo's negotiator and dealmaker. Perri diversified into gambling, extortion and prostitution. The couple were also reported to have taken part in drug trafficking as early as 1922, when the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) suspected Perri of \\"dealing in narcotics on a large scale.\\" One report estimates that in the mid-1920s, Perri and Starkman were generating C$1 million per year through criminal endeavours and had a hundred employees. In that era, Perri was a \\"big spender\\" and the couple lived an opulent lifestyle. Nonetheless, Perri paid only $13.30 in income tax based on employment as a macaroni salesman and his \\"export/mailorder\\" business in 1926; Starkman, who claimed to be supporting him, paid $96.43. At about that time, some reports indicated that she had between $500,000 and one million in deposits at various banks. In that same year, Perri faced criminal charges in the death of seventeen people who died after drinking illegal liquor, but was acquitted of the charges. In 1927, Perri was compelled to testify at the Royal Commission on Customs and Excise inquiry, focusing on bootlegging and smuggling, and also at a hearing on tax evasion charges against Gooderham and Worts. Later that year, at the Gooderham and Worts tax evasion hearing, Perri admitted buying whisky from the distiller from 1924 to 1927. Gooderham and Worts was convicted of tax evasion in 1928 and ordered to pay a fine of $439,744. Perri and Starkman were charged with perjury after their Royal Commission testimony, but in a plea bargain, the charges were dropped against Starkman; Perri served five months of a six-month sentence and was released on September 27, 1928. Death On August 13, 1930, Starkman was ambushed at around 11:15 p.m. as she got out of Perri's car in the garage of the couple's home. Perri ran down the street after the assailants before retreating back to Starkman who had been killed with two shotgun blasts. Police found two double-barreled shotguns and the getaway car without fingerprints. The investigation eventually resulted in no criminal charges being brought despite a $5,000 reward offered by Perri. However, it was thought that Calabrian compatriot Antonio Papalia, leader of the Papalia crime family and father of Johnny Papalia, played a role in the murder. On August 17, about 20,000 people lined the street for the funeral cortege of hundreds of vehicles; Perri fainted at the gravesite. Starkman's headstone in Hamilton's Ohev Zedek Cemetery, commissioned by Perri, referred to her as \\"Bessie Starkman ‚Äì Perri\\", but the \\"Perri\\" part was later removed by persons unknown. Part of Starkman's estate went to Perri, and the rest to her children. In popular culture * In July 2014, the first performance of a one-woman play, Bootlegger's Wife, about Starkman's life was staged at Theatre Aquarius in Hamilton. The creator and star was Victoria Murdoch; while the Perri character does not appear, \\"voiceovers\\" provide his comments. The play was staged again in mid-March 2019 and at intervals between those dates. * Bessie Starkman appeared as a character on the CBC Television program Frankie Drake Mysteries in Season 2 (2018), portrayed by Natalie Brown, in an episode titled \\"Dealer's Choice\\". Another website states that the character runs an \\"illegal sports betting, and an underground casino\\" and is described as the \\"financial brains of the gang\\".

Plot In Serro Azul, a city in the interior of Minas Gerais, where the internet signal has not yet arrived, a source with rejuvenating and curative properties is protected by seven guardians‚ÄîMayor Eurico (Dan Stulbach), delegate Machado (Milhem Cortaz), the doctor Aranha (Paulo Rocha), the beggar Feliciano (Leopoldo Pacheco), the cafetina Ondina (Ana Beatriz Nogueira), the esoteric Milu (Zez√© Polessa) and the guardian Eg√≠dio (Antonio Calloni)‚Äîtake public notice and fall into the wrong hands. They also protect L√©on the cat (Eduardo Moscovis), a former guardian who was punished by the forces of nature to live in animal form for breaching one of the rules: not to constitute a family. When Eg√≠dio dies, he leaves in search of the new seventh guardian, because only then his charm will be finally broken. In S√£o Paulo, Gabriel (Bruno Gagliasso) sees L√©on through the streets and, mysteriously, feels that he must go to Serro Azul with the certainty that his destiny is there. He abandons the bride, Laura (Yanna Lavigne), at the altar, but on the escape ends up in a vehicular accident, subsequently being saved by the mystical powers of Luz (Marina Ruy Barbosa). Everything changes with the arrival of Gabriel's mother, Valentina (Lilia Cabral), a great cosmetologist who was born in Serro Azul and left for the capital in search of power. With the help of unscrupulous driver Sampaio (Marcello Novaes), she returns only to discover the secrets of the source wealth. She will also be the great impediment of Luz and Gabriel's affair, since she was destined to flee from bankruptcy by marrying her son with Laura, daughter of the powerful Olavo (Tony Ramos), who was willing to merge the companies of the two families and now swears to destroy the shrew. In addition, the couple have to deal with Laura's revenge and the obsession of the arrogant ex-boyfriend of Luz, Enrico J√∫nior (Jos√© Loreto), and the envious Lourdes (Bruna Linzmeyer), who plays with the feelings of the naive Geandro (Caio Blat), but wants Gabriel. Also returning to the city is Neide (Viviane Ara√∫jo), Luz's mother who fled after she was born. She was indirectly responsible for L√©on being turned into a cat, since he promised to take her pregnancy even against the rules of the guardians and, after punishing the source, left her believing that she was abandoned. The city still keeps other stories, such as Mirtes (Elizabeth Savalla), a fervent blessed who lives supervising the lives of others, especially Nora Stella (Vanessa Gi√°como), whom she always humbles for not giving her grandchildren, and of Jo√£o In√°cio (Paulo Vilhena), the ex-husband of her deceased daughter, who is in love with the gaga prostitute Stef√¢nia (Carol Duarte). Maltoni (Matheus Abreu) is a handsome sexton who attracts girls to the church to admire him and lives a forbidden romance with Elisa (Giullia Buscacio), daughter of the conservative Jurandir (Paulo Miklos), who wants her to become a nun. Already Machado is a false macho man addicted to robbing panties of the neighbours to use in the bed with his wife Rita (Fl√°via Alessandra) in a fiery and comical relation, causing a great mystery in the city. Aphrodite (Carolina Dieckmann) lives in conflict with her husband, the cook Nicolau (Marcelo Serrado), for wanting to have a son, although they are already parents of four‚Äîthree girls and a boy who hates sports.

The Maya Block in the north has igneous and metamorphic North American Craton basement rocks, overlain by late Paleozoic metasedimentary rocks, which experienced deformation during the Devonian. Red beds, evaporites and marine limestone from the Mesozoic overlie these rocks. A karst landscape formed in the thick limestone units across the north of the country. During a collisional orogeny, these Paleozoic and Mesozoic rocks were uplifted, thrusted and folded as the Central Guatemalan Cordillera. Paleogene rocks from the early Cenozoic include volcanic and marine clastic rocks, associated with high rates of erosion. By contrast, to the south of the Motagua Valley, the underlying rocks belong to the Chortis Block‚Äîthe northern section of the Caribbean Plate. Many geologists have interpreted the Chortis Block as having \\"translated\\" eastward to its present position, with Cretaceous brittle deformation and uplift suggesting a connection to the Laramide orogeny building up the Rocky Mountains to the north. Particularly within the Quaternary, the Cocos Plate which split off the Pacific Plate in the Oligocene has subducted beneath the Caribbean and North American plates, producing a chain of volcanoes along the Pacific Coast of Guatemala. The North American and Caribbean plates are moving with strike-slip displacement along the Motagua-Polochic Fault Zone. Some have looked to the Paleozoic organic shales and the Todos Santos sandstone, with its evaporite \\"cap\\" as a potential reservoir for oil and gas. The Sierra de Santa Cruz Massif has an ophiolite zone with serpentized harzburgite around a two kilometer thick gabbro pluton with quartz diorite.

It has a robust, dark brown to blackish flowering stem with up to seventy cinnamon brown, tube- shaped flowers that are white inside. It grows in high rainfall forest in southeastern Australia.  Description  Gastrodia procera is a leafless terrestrial, mycotrophic herb that has a robust, dark brown to blackish flowering stem tall bearing between five and seventy cinnamon brown, tube- shaped flowers that are warty outside and white inside. The sepals and petals are joined, forming a tube long. The petals have wavy edges. The labellum is long, wide and white with orange-coloured edges. Flowering occurs from December to January and flowering is enhanced by fire the previous summer. Taxonomy and naming Gastrodia procera was first formally described in 1991 by Geoffrey William Carr from a specimen collected in the Dandenong Ranges near Albany in 1958.

He was the father of Labour politician Eluned Morgan. Early life and education Morgan was born on 28 October 1928 and grew up in Tremorfa, Cardiff, until the Second World War forced his family to evacuate to Aberdare where he went to the local grammar school. After the war he returned to Cardiff and, after spending National Service in the RAF, got a job as an insurance clerk. With ambitions to become a social worker he took two A-levels in six months, before graduating in Politics and Economics at University College, Cardiff. He went on to the theological college at Mirfield in Yorkshire before being ordained in 1957 to a curacy at St Augustine's Church, Penarth where he served until 1961. He married his wife, Elaine, in 1963. Career In 1961 Morgan became curate on the large Cardiff housing estate of Ely. He became vicar of the Ely parish (which had been formed by the Mirfield Community of the Resurrection) in 1967. He raised ¬£10,000 to repair the Church of the Resurrection and established himself as a central figure in the area. The Church of the Resurrection became a community centre and refuge for the locals. It held a weekly disco in the church hall. In 1974, after being encouraged by a church warden to enter into politics, Morgan was elected to Cardiff City Council and South Glamorgan County Council for the Ely ward. In 1977 he became leader of Labour group on South Glamorgan Council and subsequently leader of the council when Labour regained control in 1982. He led the regeneration of Cardiff's impoverished ex-industrial areas. He was replaced by Jack Brooks as leader in 1989, became chairman of the council in 1992, before retiring from politics the following year. Morgan was awarded the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1994 New Years Honours, for \\"services to the community in South Glamorgan\\". Retrieved 11 November 2018.

He died on 23 November 2011 at Morriston Hospital, Swansea. In tribute, former First Minister of Wales Rhodri Morgan said \\"\\"He was a massive figure in Ely and in South Glamorgan politics, and he married religion and politics remarkably effectively in that he never saw any distinction between being a very committed Christian vicar of a very deprived parish... and being a leader and member of the Labour group on South Glamorgan county council.\\" In 2016 a memorial glass screen was unveiled at the Church of Resurrection, with lines from the Magnificat in English and Welsh.

Western and central Cuba are a deformed orogen, that came about due to the collision of an island arc in the Cretaceous with the Florida-Bahamas platform. As a result, the Cuban ophiolite zone became obducted and a northward verging fold and thrust belt formed. A second small orogeny took place in the Paleocene and Eocene. Eastern Cuba, southeast of the Cauto Basin, by contrast has a Cenozoic volcanic arc complex, with ophiolites north and east of the Sierra Maestra as Mesozoic-age orogen rocks overlain by Paleogene sedimentary rocks and tuff. Sedimentation due to the tectonic activity continued into the Oligocene. Structural Geology *Pinar Del Rio Block: **Esperanze zone: Thin belt of Jurassic and Cretaceous limestone, dolomite and evaporite in the west found in Cayo Coco and Los Remedios zones. Deformed by thrust faulting into three nappes. **Sierra del Rosario zone: Antiformal arrangement of three nappes with Jurassic-Cretaceous ophiolites, siliceous slates, mafic and intermediate lava.

The procedure is generally performed when a girl is seven years old and involves the total or partial removal of the clitoral hood. Consequences of FGM may range from discomfort to sepsis. Practice= Occurrence = FGM is practised by the Dawoodi Bohra, a sect of Shia Islam with one million members in India. Known as khatna, khafz, and khafd, the procedure is performed on six- or seven-year-old girls and involves the total or partial removal of the clitoral hood. The spiritual leader of the Dawoodi Bohra, Syedna Mufaddal Saifuddin, stated in 2016: \\"Religious books, written over a thousand years ago, specify the requirements for both males and females as acts of religious purity.\\" The statement also emphasized the need to \\"respect the law of the land\\". Other Bohra sects including the Sulemani Bohras and the Alavi Bohras, as well as some Sunni communities in Kerala, are reported as practising FGM. = Consequences = Dr. Meghana Reddy J, a gynaecologist, reported in 2018 that khatna can lead to complications in later life, including difficult deliveries and urinary infections. In one case a girl had developed sepsis after having had khatna and great effort had been required to revive her. In conjunction with a small study, the first of its kind in India, twenty Bohra women were examined by Dr. Sujaat Vali, an obstetrician and gynaecologist, who reported that only a specialist would be able to separate and cut the clitoral hood without also cutting the clitoris, and the clitoris had been cut in most cases examined. According to Vali, \\"[h]alf of them feel some kind of irritation, while 30% either feel discomfort while walking/urinating or have lost sensitivity in the area.\\" The study covered 83 women and 11 men from five Indian states and found that 75 percent of the respondents' daughters who were at least seven years old had been subjected to FGM. Activism= Opposition = In November 2011 a Bohra woman posted an online petition requesting that Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin, religious leader of the Dawoodi Bohras, ban FGM. A spokesman ruled out any change saying \\"Bohra women should understand that our religion advocates the procedure and they should follow it without any argument.\\" Two Mumbai-based groups, Sahiyo and We Speak Out, launched a campaign in February 2016 called \\"Each One Reach One\\"; the campaign was repeated during Ramadan in 2017. The campaign promoted conversations about female genital cutting. In an online survey of Bohra women, Sahiyo found that khatna had been performed on 80 percent of participants, with most cut when aged six or seven; 81 percent wanted the practice to stop. On 10 December 2016 (Human Rights Day), a group of Dawoodi Bohra women started an online petition calling for FGM to be banned. A similar petition was conducted by the group a year earlier; that petition was submitted to India's Women and Child Development Minister Maneka Gandhi. Also that month, Dawoodi Bohra women petitioned the United Nations demanding that India be recognised as a country where Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) or Female Genital Cutting (FGC) is practised. In September 2017, when the 36th regular session of the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) was conducting a Universal Periodic Review of India, a written submission on FGM in India was presented at a side event. That was the first time the issue of FGM in India had been raised at the United Nations. = Support = The Dawoodi Bohra Women for Religious Freedom (DBWRF) was established in May 2017 by six Bohra women to support their \\"beliefs, customs, culture and religious rights\\". It claims to represent the views of nearly 75,000 women who are followers of Mufaddal Saifuddin. The DBWRF states that the form of FGM practiced by the Dawoodi Bohra is a harmless procedure and not mutilation. DBWRF's stated mission is to \\"stand for the rights of Dawoodi Bohra women in India\\" to ensure they have the same freedom as other citizens, particularly by defending women who are victimised for their religious beliefs, practices, customs and culture. In the face of controversy, DBWRF has taken the lead in ensuring that the practice of FGM is protected. In July 2018, senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi represented the DBWRF during proceedings in the Supreme Court and stated that \\"the practice of khafz is an essential part of the religion as practised by Dawoodi Bohra Community and their right to practise and propagate religion is protected under Articles 25 and 26 of the Constitution of India\\".  Supreme Court  In May 2017 a public interest litigation (PIL) case was raised in India's Supreme Court. The case was filed by Sunita Tiwari, a lawyer based in Delhi, seeking a ban on FGM in India. The Supreme Court received the petition and sought responses from four states and four ministries of the central government. An advocate for the petition claimed the practice violated children's rights under Article 14 (Right to Equality) and Article 21 (Right to Life) of the Constitution of India, while an advocate opposing the petition argued that khafz is an essential part of the community's religion, and their right to practise the religion is protected under Articles 25 and 26. The Ministry of Women and Child Development reported in December 2017 that \\"there is no official data or study which supports the existence of FGM in India.\\" Earlier, in May 2017, Women and Child Development Minister Maneka Gandhi announced that the government will ban FGM if it is not voluntarily stopped. In April 2018 India's Attorney General K. K. Venugopal asked a bench of the Supreme Court to issue directions regarding the case, saying that FGM was already a crime under existing law. The bench adjourned the case and issued notices to Kerala and Telangana, having earlier notified Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Delhi. In September 2018 the Supreme Court referred the PIL to a five-judge constitution bench at the request of Venugopal and the counsel for the Dawoodi Bohras. In November 2019, the Supreme Court decided that the issue of FGM be referred to a larger seven-judge bench and that it be examined alongside other women's rights issues. The court said it was a \\"seminal issue\\" regarding the power of the court to decide whether a practice is essential to a religion.\\"Female genital mutilation petition pending before Supreme Court\\", Hindustan Times, 15 November 2019.

He is also Professor of Psychology at Claremont Graduate University. His research focuses on cognitive development and mental rotation in infants, as well as behavioral epigenetics. His 2002 book, The Dependent Gene, criticized some of the fundamental assumptions underlying the nature-nurture debate. His 2015 book, The Developing Genome: An Introduction to Behavioral Epigenetics, received positive reviews, and was awarded the American Psychological Association's Eleanor Maccoby and William James Book Awards in 2016. A short pr√©cis of the book was subsequently published in WIREs Systems Biology and Medicine. Moore's work has been profiled in The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, Scientific American, and Parents. In collaboration with Scott P. Johnson, Moore has demonstrated that infants as young as three to five months of age are capable of mental rotation. Subsequent work revealed that object exploration can facilitate 4-month-olds' mental rotation performances and that early postnatal testosterone exposure and parental attitudes about gender are related to some infants' mental rotation performances. Moore was the director of the National Science Foundation‚Äôs Developmental Sciences Program from 2016 to 2018, and he was elected to a three-year term as Member-at-Large of the Division of Developmental Psychology of the American Psychological Association, from 2020 to 2023.

Location and description The island is situated between Quail Island (some away) and Moepuku Point, a peninsula between Teddington and Charteris Bay, off Banks Peninsula. The island is approximately long and metres wide, covering an estimated at mean high water mark. It is composed of Charteris Bay Sandstone, with a thin layer of soil supporting forest. Name The MƒÅori name is considered to mean \\"no name\\". The origin of the English name is unknown: it might refer to a comic book character, King William IV, or an Aboriginal Australian whaler Billy Lanny. History Archaeological sites are recorded on the island showing evidence of quarries, landing sites, and middens. In pre-European times, the island was a source for MƒÅori of coarse sandstone used for grinding stone including pounamu (greenstone). As such the island has cultural significance to NgƒÅi Tahu, especially to Te Hap≈´ o NgƒÅti Wheke (RƒÅpaki). This sandstone was later quarried by colonists for the corners and facing of the Lyttelton Gaol, among other buildings. The area was included in Walter Mantell's controversial securing of the harbour (then called Port Cooper) and surrounding land for the Crown in 1849. In April 1858 the island was part of a purchase by Mark Stoddart, and was subsequently sold to Thomas Potts, then to William Rolleston for public purposes. It was owned by the Anderson until 1975, then sold to the Crown. In 1979 it was classified as a Recreation Reserve, but in 1980 this was changed to a Scenic Reserve.

Its nearest higher peak is Mount Lougheed, to the southeast. Windtower is a conspicuous landmark that can be seen from Highway 1, the Trans-Canada Highway in the Canmore area. Although not of remarkable elevation, the mountain has an imposing, overhanging north face with an appearance similar to peaks in The Bugaboos.  Climbing Routes The Iron Butterfly is a formidable 450 metre 5.11 A4 rock climbing route on the northwest face. It was first climbed in 1988 by Jeff Marshall and Steve DeMaio, but attempts by others to repeat the feat have been unsuccessful. The Northeast Ridge is a 5.5 route first climbed by B. Corbeau, G. Crocker and K. Hahn in July 1965. The Northeast Face is a 570-metre 5.10a route first climbed by G. Homer and R. Wood in 1972. The West Slope is a hike and easy scree scramble from Highway 742, the Smith-Dorrien/Spray Trail. History Windtower was named in 1950. The mountain's name was officially adopted in 1982 by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. Geology Windtower is composed of Palliser limestone, a sedimentary rock laid down during the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny.

It was developed as an entrepot by the Portuguese in 1562 with the permission of the local lord ≈åmura Sumitada, but was burned down a year later during a rebellion against Sumitada. History=Background= In 1543, Europeans reached Japan for the first time when a Chinese junk carrying Portuguese traders shipwrecked on Tanegashima. The Portuguese introduced the arquebus to the Japanese during this chance encounter, which gave the Japanese, undergoing the bloody Sengoku period at the time, a powerful weapon with which they conducted their internecine wars. The discovery of Japan was attractive to Portuguese merchants and missionaries alike, for it gave the merchants a new market to trade their goods, and the Jesuit missionaries eyed Japan for new converts into Christianity. Likewise, the warlords of Kyushu vied to get the Portuguese carrack (called the black ship by the Japanese) into their harbours, since the ship also brought considerable wealth to their fiefdoms in addition to the guns. The Portuguese initially made Hirado their preferred port of call, although they also visited the ports in Satsuma and Bungo from time to time. The Jesuits felt that the carrack should take turns visiting each port of Kyushu so the priests could cover more ground and convert more people, but the merchants had other priorities in mind: the carrack had to land at a harbour that protected their valuable cargo from the wind and weather, and a stable port of call was essential to build a reliable clientele. The daimy≈ç of Hirado, Matsura Takanobu, was initially accommodative to the missionaries due to their association with the Portuguese traders, but turned hostile once he felt they overdid their evangelization by burning books and destroying Buddhist images. Matsura Takanobu evicted the missionaries from Hirado in 1558, and did not allow them to come back for five years. In 1561, 15 Portuguese were killed in Hirado in a brawl with the Japanese; a captain was also killed in Akune, marking the first recorded clashes between Europeans and the Japanese. Faced with such events, it became clear to the Portuguese that they needed to find a safer port to call. =Establishment of the Christian community= Under the urgings of the Jesuit viceprovincial Cosme de Torres to find a new port, the Portuguese sounded the harbour of Yokoseura on a discreet fishing boat and found it suitable for large Portuguese ships. Crucially, the local lord ≈åmura Sumitada was more than willing to accommodate the foreigners. ≈åmura Sumitada's district of Sonogi in Hizen Province was mountainous and lacking in resources. His hold onto these lands was not stable due to an ongoing succession feud, in which Sumitada, an adopted son of ≈åmura Sumisaki (Â§ßÊùëÁ¥îÂâç), was placed in charge instead of the biological but illegitimate son Got≈ç Takaakira (ÂæåËó§Ë≤¥Êòé). For these reasons Sumitada depended on the deep water ports to keep himself in power, even if that meant following the European religion. Sumitada communicated to the missionaries that he would be happy to receive the Portuguese in Yokoseura. In addition, he would let the Jesuits build a church there, make Yokoseura exempt from taxes for ten years, and forbid non- Christians to stay there. With such promising prospects, the Jesuits directed the Portuguese carrack into Yokoseura the next year in 1562. With Sumitada's blessing, a church was built in Yokoseura where a Buddhist temple had once stood, and an enormous wooden cross, 18 feet high and 9 feet wide, was erected in front of the church. Soon, the exclusively Christian community, the first of its kind in Japan, attracted Christians and merchants from as far as Kyoto. By April 1563, the population of Yokoseura numbered around 300 Christians. Sumitada took an active interest in Christianity, such that he built himself a residence in Yokoseura next to the church and made attending mass compulsory for all residents of Yokoseura. In early June 1563, Sumitada was baptised in the church of Yokoseura, took the baptismal name Bartolomeu, and became known as the first Christian daimy≈ç. =Destruction= Sumitada turned out to be quite a fervent Christian. He adorned himself in Christian symbols in place of his traditional familial emblem, razed Buddhist temples, and burned the spirit tablet of his adoptive father Sumisaki. This last act incensed the unbaptised members of the ≈åmura clan, who rallied behind Got≈ç Takaakira. Rumours reached Yokoseura on 8 August that Takaakira was plotting to kill Sumitada and Cosme de Torres, but this was contradicted five days later by news that Takaakira had sent for a priest to give him a sermon. A party was assembled under the convert Tomonaga Shinsuke (ÊúùÈï∑Êñ∞Âä©, Christian name Luis) to bring the priests Lu√≠s Fr√≥is and Juan Fern√°ndez to Takaakira's town of Takeo, but Fr√≥is was too sick to travel and the priests decided to stay behind. Tomonaga went on ahead with the party, only to be ambushed and slaughtered by Takaakira's men near the Hario Strait (ÈáùÂ∞æÁÄ¨Êà∏) on August 17. Believing the missionaries to be dead, Takaakira moved to attack Sumitada in his home city of ≈åmura, putting him to flight. Having lost the military backing of Sumitada, the situation in Yokoseura became insecure, and the Japanese merchants decided to leave the town on the morning of August 18. That night, opportunistic merchants from Bungo Province burned down Yokoseura as they stood to lose if the Portuguese became permanently settled and not go to Bungo any more. To make that point clear, they abducted the sickly Cosme de Torres and Lu√≠s Fr√≥is and tried to use the priests to blackmail the Portuguese into trading in Bungo. The two were finally released on August 20. With Yokoseura destroyed, the Portuguese were forced to return to Hirado to trade while they find a new anchorage. Sumitada survived the coup and regained control of the ≈åmura clan, and in 1565 directed the Portuguese to the port of Fukuda, closer to his home city of ≈åmura. Matsura Takanobu, the daimy≈ç of Hirado, sent a fleet to destroy this new anchorage to protect his own mercantile interests, but it was repelled by the Portuguese in the battle of Fukuda Bay. The Portuguese continued to call at Fukuda and the nearby Kuchinotsu for a few more years, but they felt the terrains of these ports were lacking and kept searching until Sumitada offered the Jesuits the nearby port of Nagasaki, a mere fishing village at the time that the Portuguese found to be perfect. The former inhabitants of Yokoseura were moved to Nagasaki, and from 1571 onward the Portuguese traders focused their activities there, turning it into the hub of Japan's foreign trade and its window to the West until the 19th century. Tourism Yokoseura Historical Park The destruction of Yokoseura in 1563, to which followed the seclusion of Japan and the persecution of Christians in the Edo period, left no physical trace of the Yokoseura Christian settlement today. However, as Yokoseura was the place where Lu√≠s Fr√≥is (who went on to write the seminal Historia de Iapam) first landed in Japan, and where the first Christian daimy≈ç received baptism, the Saikai city government decided to develop Yokoseura as a potential tourist attraction. The Yokoseura Historical Park (Ê®™ÁÄ¨Êµ¶Âè≤Ë∑°ÂÖ¨Âúí) was completed in 2003, with structures within it built according to Alessandro Valignano's principles for building churches in Japan.

Developed by Creative Assembly's Australian studio and published by Sega for the Nintendo DS, the game received generally positive reviews upon release. A limited edition, exclusive to Spain and Australia, was released concurrently alongside the standard version of the game. The limited edition comes with a tin box containing the base game, a Sonic figurine, and five postcards of Sonic artwork. Overview Sonic Classic Collection contains Sonic the Hedgehog, Sonic the Hedgehog 2, Sonic the Hedgehog 3, and Sonic & Knuckles. The Lock-on modes from the original Sonic & Knuckles cartridge (Blue Sphere, Knuckles in Sonic the Hedgehog 2 and Sonic 3 & Knuckles) are fully implemented and playable. The ability to save and load at any point, a feature not found in the original games, is also present. Alongside the main games, a gallery of early artwork from the Sonic series is viewable. Development On November 11, 2009, the BBFC classified Sonic Classic Collection, accidentally announcing the game early. Two videos, one about Sonic Chronicles: The Dark Brotherhood and the other about the history of the Sonic franchise, were listed as content present within the game. These were presumably cut, as they are not featured in the final version of the game. Sonic Classic Collection was formerly announced by Sega on December 1, 2009 through a press release. During development, Sega had hired Stephan Dittrich to be a lead programmer for the game. Stephan had created a Sega Genesis emulator for the Nintendo DS named jEnesisDS, and Sonic Classic Collection runs on a modified version of the emulator in which screen size has been cropped to properly fit the top screen. In 2015, a former Creative Assembly employee featured Sonic Classic Collection illustrations on his portfolio. Among the artwork were icons for Sonic Spinball, Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine, and Sonic 3D Blast. These games were not present in the final release. Reception Sonic Classic Collection received mixed reviews according to review aggregator Metacritic. Critics generally agreed that the compilation was fun and that the games could still be enjoyable after their original release. However, critics criticised the emulation for \\"the iffy frame rate present in all the games\\", and \\"although the game never slows down to the extent of Sonic‚Äôs infamous Game Boy Advance outing, it‚Äôs a fact that the DS shouldn‚Äôt be struggling with these games\\". More points of contention were the lack of multiplayer and how loading a file \\"just kicks you back to the start of the level that you were playing\\". A lack of extras was another complaint, as they were described as \\"extremely little... to get excited about\\" and how it had \\"only the basics of legacy material like character art.\\" ReferencesExternal links Sonic Classic Collection on MobyGames 2010 video games Nintendo DS games Nintendo DS-only games Sonic the Hedgehog video games Sega video game compilations Video games developed in Australia ","title":"Sonic Classic Collection"},{"id":"59016596","text":"Alfred Moul (c. 1852 ‚Äì 18 January 1924) was a composer, pianist, agent, critic, and impresario.

Origin and family  The Retti illustrated in Germany and the Czech Republic the emigration of Italian artists to Europe from the Alpine valleys near Como, such as the Marca, of Franche-Comt√© or the Landi and Resti of Hungary. Leaving their families in their native villages, where they may or may not return at the end of their lives, the children of a few families of Italian marble workers or stucco workers were apprenticed to a master who had already left, usually from his own family. The apprentice followed his master wherever he went. There he met the other apprentices. Between them, there were contracts and worksites. It was not uncommon for brothers to work together in the same specialization; they married girls from associated families and were highly mobile from their respective points of attachment. Over time, the disciplines became more specialized and complex, so that the members of the siblings were no longer as versatile as in the 16th century. The architect, although himself versed in painting or stucco, gradually took on a dominant hierarchical role and distributed the tasks. Retti was indeed from a family of artists: * his father was Lorenzo Mattia Retti, he was a stucco master * His brother Donato Riccardo Retti was also a stucco artist (He was with Emanuele Pighini the interior designer of the baroque interior of the collegiate church of Ellwangen * his brothers Leopoldo and Paolo Retti were both architects * His uncle Donato Giuseppe Frisoni was a master stucco artist and architect. It was his uncle Frisoni who changed the fate of the Retti family by accepting the contract offered to him by Eberhard Louis, Duke of W√ºrttemberg for the construction and completion of his new Ludwigsburg Palace which would become one of the largest baroque castles in Germany.. Previously, Frisoni worked as a stucco craftman in Prague. Indeed, once he had settled in Ludwigsburg, he brought to his adopted town his extended family from Laino in Lombardy, Province of Como. The amount of work was gigantic in Southern Germany, whose taste for Baroque art reached its peak during the period of the Counter- Reformation. Italian artists collaborated with artists and craftsmen from Bohemia, especially from the Baroque city of Prague, and some families of craftsmen from Franconia and W√ºrttemberg such as the Dientzenhofer.. The Retti were no exception because there were other Italian artists, travelling or not, who worked on construction sites in southern German-speaking countries and especially in Prague. The families of stuccoers and craftsmen from the Val d'Intelvi, in the Como region, merged and helped each other, among them the Carloni, the Retti, the Scotti, the Aliprandi, the Barberini, the Quaglio, all of them from Laino like the Frisonis. In Schw√§bisch Hall the Retti met the Italian sculptors Emmanuelo Pighini and Tomaso Gavoni who created the statues of the entrance hall of the new city hall.  Works  Retti was appointed painter of the court of W√ºrttemberg in 1732 and in 1743, he was appointed court painter of the Electoral Palatinate. He specialized in mural paintings and mainly frescoes of church ceilings or official buildings representative of the regional nobility. His uncle first called him for the decoration of the Ludwigsburg Palace. His major work is the fresco of the ceiling of the Ordenskapelle in the ducal residence. Through the work-sharing of the sites between parenteles and associated craftsmen's families, Retti also participated in the decoration of the castles of Ansbach, Bad Mergentheim and W√ºrzburg where in particular worked his brother Leopoldo Retti, chief architect of W√ºrttemberg since 1750. and a specialist in rococo architecture such as the Retti-Palais in Ansbach. = Schw√§bisch Hall = \\"Victory of virtue over vices\\" on the ceiling of the Great Council Chamber of City Hall in Schw√§bisch Hall. Hall and its prosperity. Oil painting on the ceiling of the hero room of the town hall of Schw√§bisch Hall: Greek and Roman heroes. Between 1736 and 1738, Retti was called by the advisers of the free imperial city of Schw√§bisch Hall for the interior decoration of the new Baroque town hall which was built on the site of a Franciscan convent church devastated by a fire in the city in 1728.. Retti painted 22 murals in the town hall of Schw√§bisch Hall. whose rooms were originally equipped with parquet floors with sculpted benches. These were actually oil paintings on canvas that were stretched on ceilings or walls. He did not paint a fresco directly on the wall after treatment. His paintings were then framed by a stucco decoration, often representing naturalistic motifs, and decorated with figurative medallions. After the fire, traces of wall paintings were found directly below Retti's oil paintings; they represented landscapes of Hall, Limpurg, Vellberg and the Comburg. The current paintings in the City Hall are copies. There are three rooms: * the heroes' room; ** Alexander the Great destroys the Gordian knot (wall) ** Aeneas saves his father Anchises from Troy on fire (wall) ** The martyred death of Marcus Curtius (wall) ** Achilles, Patroclus, Hector, Aeneas, Romulus, Caesar, Pompey, Scipio and Hannibal (ceiling) * the Hall which revolves around the allegory of the city republic of Hall. ** Allegory of the city of Hall and its prosperity (ceiling) ** Allegory of merit with the Latin motto \\"Nemini sua munera claudit\\" (wall) ** Allegory of the action with the Latin motto \\"Nemo otiosus!\\" (wall) ** Architecture and Fine Arts of Schw√§bisch Hall (wall) ** Beneficence of Schw√§bisch Hall (wall) ** Agricultural life, crafts and industry in Schw√§bisch Hall (wall) * the Council Room is decorated mainly with biblical motifs such as the Last Judgment. ** Joseph and his brothers (right wall) ** The sacrifice of Isaac (right wall) ** The judgment of Solomon (left wall) ** Jacob's fight with the angel on the banks of the Jabbok (left wall) ** Pharaoh's daughter saves Moses (wall) ** Samson's fight with the lion (door top) ** David and Jonathan's oath against Saul (door top) ** The request of Semeis to David (top of door) ** Victory of virtue over vices or Victory of Christianity over paganism (ceiling) In the music room (Musiksaal) is the Allegory of music and the five senses.. Retti also realized the allegory entitled \\"The Beneficial Power of Fire\\". and the allegory entitled \\"The destructive power of fire\\". Retti's original works in Schw√§bisch hall no longer exist. They were destroyed by a fire that ravaged the interior of City Hall after an incendiary bombing on April 16, 1945.

It was compiled by Helena Blavatsky and included into the 2nd volume of the Blavatsky Collected Writings. According to a doctoral thesis by Tim Rudb√∏g, in this \\"important\\" article Blavatsky \\"began conceptualizing her idea of 'Theosophy'.\\"  Analysis of contents = Definition of Theosophy = Blavatsky writes that, \\"according to lexicographers, the term theosophia is composed of two Greek words‚Äîtheos \\"god,\\" and sophos \\"wise.\\" She then writes that Noah Webster defines it as \\"a supposed intercourse with God and superior spirits, and consequent attainment of superhuman knowledge, by physical processes, as by the theurgic operations of some ancient Platonists, or by the chemical processes of the German fire-philosophers.\\" Professor James Santucci wrote that the article author considers this interpretation unsuccessful, calling it \\"a poor and flippant explanation.\\" In hers opinion, Robert Vaughan has proposed \\"a far better, more philosophical\\" definition: \\"A Theosophist is one who gives you a theory of God or the works of God, which has not revelation, but an inspiration of his own for its basis.\\" She continues: > \\"In this view every great thinker and philosopher, especially every founder > of a new religion, school of philosophy, or sect, is necessarily a > Theosophist. Hence, Theosophy and Theosophists have existed ever since the > first glimmering of nascent thought made man seek instinctively for the > means of expressing his own independent opinions.\\" Both Alexander Senkevich and Tim Rudb√∏g stated that, to fully define Theosophy, Blavatsky proposes to consider it \\"under all its aspects.\\" Both Santucci and Rudb√∏g have quoted in the article: > \\"The interior world has not been hidden from all by impenetrable darkness. > By that higher intuition acquired by Theosophia‚Äîor God-knowledge, which > carries the mind from the world of form into that of formless spirit, man > has been sometimes enabled in every age and every country to perceive things > in the interior or invisible world.\\" Santucci wrote that among the Theosophical ancestors, mentioned further by the article author, were the Hindu ascetics, the Neoplatonists, the Rosicrucians or Fire-philosophers, and other mystics. According to Blavatsky, they were all involved in \\"the search after man's diviner 'self',\\" which accompanied the theurgy she described. Santucci stated that, according to Iamblichus, theurgy is, as Blavatsky points in hers article, \\"the art of applying the divine powers of man to the subordination of the blind forces of nature.\\" This \\"search\\" was often viewed \\"as individual communion with a personal God\\", and although this was not true, it was the aim of every mystic at all times. Senkevich wrote that the article author quotes Alfred Russel Wallace, F.R.S., a spiritualist who, as she writes, \\"with brave candour\\" claimed: > \\"It is 'spirit' that alone feels, and perceives, and thinks‚Äîthat acquires > knowledge, and reasons and aspires... there not unfrequently occur > individuals so constituted that the spirit can perceive independently of the > corporeal organs of sense, or can perhaps, wholly or partially, quit the > body for a time and return to it again... the spirit... communicates with > spirit easier than with matter.\\" Santucci stated that Theosophy or \\"Divine Wisdom\\", according to Blavatsky, is the Highest Truth about God, the universe and man, \\"It is a Truth that in its pure form is primordial, in that it existed from the dawn of Humanity; esoteric, since only those few individuals capable of understanding such knowledge are allowed to receive it; and universal, because all great minds throughout the world enunciated the same Wisdom.\\" Rudb√∏g wrote that this article is the first example in which Blavatsky's \\"concept of a 'Wisdom- Religion' is directly correlated with 'Theosophy'.\\" He quoted: \\"Theosophy is, then, the archaic Wisdom-Religion, the esoteric doctrine once known in every ancient country having claims to civilization.\\" Both Tim Rudb√∏g and Julia Shabanova have cited Blavatsky's definition of Theosophy as the Wisdom- Religion: > \\"This 'Wisdom' all the old writings show us as an emanation of the divine > Principle; and the clear comprehension of it is typified in such names as > the Indian Budha, the Babylonian Nebo, the Thoth of Memphis, the Hermes of > Greece; in the appellations, also, of some goddesses‚ÄîMetis, Neitha, Athena, > the Gnostic Sophia, and finally the Vedas, from the word 'to know'.\\" = Basic idea of Theosophy = James Santucci wrote that Theosophy, according to Blavatsky, \\"refers to a nexus of teachings associated with the Supreme, the macrocosmos (the universe or Nature), and microcosmos (humanity).\\" He noted that in hers article she first presents the statement on \\"a single Supreme Essence, Unknown and Unknowable\\" which was the \\"central idea of the Eclectic Theosophy.\\" Professor Julia Shabanova wrote that an idea of Theosophy was not alien to German idealism, with which were traditionally associated rationalism and even panlogism; this is about \\"that Theosophy which\\", as Blavatsky argues, \\"prompted such men as Hegel, Fichte and Spinoza to take up the labors of the old Grecian philosophers and speculate upon the One Substance‚Äîthe Deity, the Divine All proceeding from the Divine Wisdom‚Äîincomprehensible, unknown and unnamed‚Äîby any ancient or modern religious philosophy.\\" Having mentioned these manifestations of Theosophy, the article author declares: > \\"Every Theosophist, then, holding to a theory of the Deity 'which has not > revelation, but an inspiration of his own for its basis,' may accept any of > the above definitions or belong to any of these religions, and yet remain > strictly within the boundaries of Theosophy. For the latter is belief in the > Deity as the All, the source of all existence, the infinite that cannot be > either comprehended or known, the universe alone revealing It, or, as some > prefer it, Him, thus giving a sex to that, to anthropomorphize which is > blasphemy.\\" Shabanova wrote that Blavatsky points to the Theosophical method of the consciousness developing, quoting \\"superb,\\" in hers opinion, essay on The Oversoul by Ralph Emerson, \\"I, the imperfect, adore my own perfect.\\" She refers Plotinus, who counted that the secret gnosis, or the knowledge of Theosophy, has \\"three degrees‚Äîopinion, science, and illumination.\\" Blavatsky continues the cite: \\"The means or instrument of the first is sense, or perception; of the second, dialectics; of the third, intuition. To the last, reason is subordinate; it is absolute knowledge, founded on the identification of the mind with the object known.\\" She then writes, \\"Theosophy is the exact science of psychology, so to say; it stands in relation to natural, uncultivated mediumship, as the knowledge of a Tyndall stands to that of a school-boy in physics.\\"  Criticism of Theosophy  Both the explicit ideological opponents of Blavatsky's doctrine and the Western esotericism scholars who claim for objectivity are equally interested in separating modern Theosophy from the classical one. For example, according to Nikolai Berdyaev, \\"contemporary 'theosophical' movements\\" corrupted the beautiful word 'Theosophy' and \\"have made us forget\\" the existence of a genuine \\"Christian theosophy\\". He believed that modern Theosophy does not represent a synthesis of religion, philosophy and science, as its adherents say, but there is a \\"mixture\\" of them, in which there is no real religion, no real philosophy, no real science. In professor Antoine Faivre's opinion, that what Blavatsky called \\"Theosophy\\" was in fact only her own doctrine. Ren√© Gu√©non believed that \\"theosophism\\" is a \\"confused mixture\\" of Neoplatonism, Gnosticism, Jewish Kabbalah, Hermeticism, and occultism. A religious philosopher Sergius Bulgakov stated that [Blavatskian] Theosophy, trying to replace religion with itself, turns into a \\"vulgar pseudoscientific mythology.\\"  Publications   See also  * \\"Is Theosophy a Religion?\\" * Theosophy and Buddhism * Theosophy and Christianity * Theosophy and Hinduism * Theosophy and literature * Theosophy and visual arts * Theosophy and Western philosophy * \\"What Are The Theosophists?\\"  Notes  References = Sources =      ;In Russian   External links  * \\"What Is Theosophy?\\" * \\"What Is Theosophy?\\" Religious studies Theosophical texts Magazine articles 1879 documents Helena Blavatsky ","title":"What Is Theosophy?"},{"id":"59016685","text":"Early history (19th century) Photographic technology was introduced to Vietnam by photographers from Europe and Hong Kong, who set up photography studios in Hanoi, Saigon, and other cities. Early photographers used photography to document archaeological sites in the region, create portraits of colonial administrators and Vietnamese royalty, and capture everyday life in cities such as Saigon. The early commercial success and spread of photography can be attributed to the recognition of photography‚Äôs potential to spread information on Cochin China, Tonkin, and Annam by colonial administrators. Thus photographers were often tasked to record early military expeditions. For instance, √âmile Gsell (1838 ‚Äì 1879) was hired to photograph Angkor Wat in the Commission d'exploration du M√©kong. Gsell would later be the first Frenchman to set-up a commercial photography studio in Saigon. Other notable French photography studio owners include Aur√©lien Pestel (1855‚Äì1897) whose photographs were exhibited at the 1894 World Exposition in Lyon and used to announce Indochina‚Äôs participation in the 1900 World‚Äôs Fair in Paris. Gsell jeune annamite.jpg\\"Young Annamese\\" by √âmile Gsell Another factor that contributed to the spread of photographic technology in Vietnam was the importance of family portraits, that would be used as part of Confucian practices of ancestor worship. Commercial photography studios not only served colonial administrators but also Mandarin elites. Notable photography studio owners include Pun Lun (ÁπΩÁ∂∏) (1864-1900), a Chinese photographer who opened studios in Saigon, Fuzhou, and Singapore, as well as Nguy·ªÖn ƒê√¨nh Kh√°nh (also known as Kh√°nh K√Ω) (1884‚Äì1946) who owned a chain of commercial studios in Vietnam and was said to have employed Ho Chi Minh in his Paris studio. Rise of photojournalism (20th century) Commercial salon photography practices decreased with the onset of the First Indochina War (1946 ‚Äì 1954) and Second Indochina War (1955 ‚Äì 1975) and were displaced by representational photography practices such as photojournalism, that served to document historic events as well as disseminate images of war to an international audience. The division of Vietnam along the 17th parallel after the 1954 Geneva Conference not only reflected the conflicting ideologies within Vietnamese Republicanism, but also the differences in the institutional structures of news agencies. The North Vietnamese government established the Vietnamese News Agency (VNA) in 1945, shortly after Ho Chi Minh‚Äôs proclamation of independence in Hanoi, as well as the Liberation News Agency (LNA) in the South along the Ho Chi Minh trail. VNA and LNA photographers were both soldiers and war correspondents, trained in military and photography techniques and answerable to the People‚Äôs Army of Vietnam. Similarly, the Republic of South Vietnam employed photographers in the Political Warfare department of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) and local newspapers that were headquartered in Saigon. However, Vietnamese photographers in the Republic of South Vietnam also had the option of freelancing for Western media outlets such as the Associated Press. There are 72 recorded deaths of North Vietnamese VNA and LNA correspondents and 4 South Vietnamese war correspondents that worked for Western media outlets. =North Vietnam= Photographs submitted to the VNA or LNA were published in local newspapers as well as publications with circulation in Eastern European states, such as the Viet Nam Pictorial. Such photographs by North Vietnamese war correspondents tended to focus on the diverse aspect of people‚Äôs lives and experiences during the wartime, rather than violent scenes from the war as seen in the images created by war correspondents working for Western news agencies. Critics have argued that this difference exhibits the decreased importance of objectivity for North Vietnamese photojournalists and desire to exercise agency in capturing images that highlight the continuation of everyday life for the civilians. However recent critiques of photography from the era, most notably by L√¢m T·∫•n T√†i (1935 - 2001) who founded the LNA, points to the restrictions by the North Vietnamese government that forbade the shooting of ongoing battle scenes and wounded soldiers. L√¢m also suggests that a sense of collective Vietnamese sentimentality resulted in the avoidance of capturing images of violence and instead a compulsion to create beautiful images. Photojournalists came from a diverse range of backgrounds. For instance, ƒêinh ƒêƒÉng ƒê·ªãnh (1920 - 2013) worked at a photography studio in his teenage years before joining the Viet Minh in 1936. He later became Ho Chi Minh‚Äôs personal photographer in 1945 and founded the Vietnamese Association of Photographic Artists (VAPA) with L√¢m T·∫•n T√†i in 1965. On the other hand, L√™ Minh Tr∆∞·ªùng (1930 - 2011) was declared unfit for combat and reassigned to be a photographer for the VNA. Other notable photographers include ƒêo√†n C√¥ng T√≠nh (b. 1943) who picked up photography while in the military academy, Vo An Khanh (b. 1936) who photographed the Mekong Delta, Mai Nam (b. 1931) who worked for the Hanoi Tien Phong (Pioneer) Newspaper, Nguy·ªÖn Khuy·∫øn who is the founder of the English-language daily Vi·ªát Nam News, and Tr·ªçng Thanh (1945 ‚Äì 2000) who led the Viet Nam Pictorial and brought \\"an East-German and Russian influence to Vietnamese photography\\". East-German and Russian influence on Vietnamese photography can also be seen in the sort of photographic equipment used by VNA and LNA correspondents. For instance, photographers were often issued a FED Soviet rangefinder or the East-German made Praktica. =South Vietnam= Less is known about the conditions and experiences of South Vietnamese war correspondents. A potential explanation is the absence of narratives of Southern Vietnamese in the history of the war, privileging the role of photographers from the North that mirrors the political narrative of the North liberating the South. Another explanation is the eclipsing of the contributions by South Vietnamese war correspondents by their Euro-American counterparts. Notable war correspondents with the ARVN were mostly established salon photographers who decided to use their craft to support the ideological position of the RV. This included Nguy·ªÖn Ngoc H·∫°nh (1927 - 2017) who was a Lieutenant Colonel and official war photographer for the ARVN, Nguy·ªÖn M·∫°nh D√¢n (b. 1925) who co-created the photo book \\"Viet Nam in Flames\\" with Nguy·ªÖn Ngoc H·∫°nh, and Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Th√¥ng (b. 1925) who was an internationally-acclaimed salon photographer based in North Vietnam before moving to Saigon. Because of their affiliation with the South Vietnamese government, Nguy·ªÖn Ngoc H·∫°nh, Nguy·ªÖn M·∫°nh D√¢n, and Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Th√¥ng were sent to reeducation camps after 1975. Other notable war correspondents include South Vietnamese photographers who worked for Western media outlets such as Hu·ª≥nh Thanh M·ªπ (1938 ‚Äì 1965) who worked for the film crew of CBS before joining the Associated Press as a staff photographer, as well as his younger brother Hu·ª≥nh C√¥ng √öt (known as Nick Ut) (b. 1951) who also worked for the Associated Press and won a Pulitzer Prize in 1973. =Reconciling the Past: exhibiting images by North and South Vietnamese photographers= New exhibitions of war photographs by both North and South Vietnamese correspondents suggest the creation of spaces for the recognition and remembrance of all photographers during the war. For instance, the Requiem ‚Äì The Vietnam Collection exhibition in the War Remnants Museum in Ho Chi Minh on 10 March 2000 showcased images by war correspondents regardless of nationality, political orientation, or press affiliation. Organised in collaboration with the Indochina Requiem project, VNA, and VAPA to commemorate the twenty-fifth anniversary of end of the \\"anti-US resistance for national salvation\\", the exhibition reflected the efforts and desires to reconcile the past and potentially build collaborative relationships between Vietnam and the United States. Modern and Contemporary photography practices (21st century)=Before ƒê·ªïi M·ªõi (1975 ‚Äì 1986)= Founded by L√¢m T·∫•n T√†i and ƒêinh ƒêƒÉng ƒê·ªãnh in 1965, the Vietnamese Artistic Photographers Association (VAPA) organised early fine art photography exhibitions and was a main driver of debates on what characterised ‚Äòartistic‚Äô versus ‚Äòdocumentary‚Äô Vietnamese photography. Key qualities of fine art photography were beauty as well as the ability to capture the essence of everyday life, specifically of the countryside as it is the only constant in the rapidly changing landscape of the country. Prior to economic liberalisation through ƒê·ªïi M·ªõi, the government was the main patron of photography and the arts. As a result VAPA represents the orthodoxy of photography in Vietnam because of how its members were some of the most famous photographers and how the association was founded with the mission of using photography to support the revolution in line with socialist ideology. =After ƒê·ªïi M·ªõi (1986 ‚Äì present)= The cautious liberalisation of economic policies in Vietnam resulted in the diversification of sources of funding and greater artistic freedoms for photographers. Opportunities were also created for increased international exposure through exhibitions and fellowship programs which has catalysed developments in fine art and documentary photography. ƒê·ªïi M·ªõi has also enabled the return of overseas Vietnamese (Vi·ªát Ki·ªÅu) artists, who have become notable figures in the ecosystem of Contemporary art. Fine Art Photography To conduct research and disseminate information about Vietnamese photography, L√¢m T·∫•n T√†i founded the Photographic Research and Development Centre in 1997. The centre later established the first Department of Photography in Vietnam at the Ho Chi Minh City College of Art and Culture in 1998, resulting in the proliferation of photography departments in other universities across the country. Ho Chi Minh City College of Art and Culture would bring together notable photographers of the time to train the next generation of Contemporary practitioners. For instance, B√πi Xu√¢n Huy (b. 1953) and his students have risen to become notable figures in Contemporary Vietnamese photography. As one of the first South Vietnamese photographers sent abroad to study photography in the School of Visual Arts in New York by VAPA in 1996, B√πi Xu√¢n Huy‚Äôs photographs are characterised by a sense of ambivalence and disorientation. Using a Holga, a non-professional camera known for its off-focus quality of images, B√πi created his Landscapes (1996 ‚Äì ongoing) series that present diptychs of street scenes in Ho Chi Minh City. His Mannequins (1999 ‚Äì ongoing) series utilises mannequins found outside clothing stores as a metaphor for the change that has engulfed the city and country. Critics have also suggested that the Mannequins series reflect the creative frustration and powerlessness of artists during this time, who \\"dress up but cannot be themselves.\\" B√πi‚Äôs students include Nguyen Thong Linh (b. 1973) who utilises photography to create image collections such as his Motorcycles (2006 ‚Äì 2007) series that documents the daily routines of Xe √îm drivers and the changing cityscape, as well as Bui Huu Phuoc (b. 1976) whose Identity Cards (2003 ‚Äì2004) series is critique of the ability of photography to capture the likeness of its subject. Documentary photography Documentary photographers experience the potential for self-censorship, especially for those whose works might reveal the underbelly of Vietnamese society. Nonetheless, documentary photography practices continue to thrive in Contemporary Vietnam. Notable photographers include ƒêo√†n ƒê·ª©c Minh (b. 1957) who captures portraits of victims of Agent Orange in his Suffering and Smiles (2000 ‚Äì 2005) series to showcase the desire of victims to struggle for their lives and counter images by foreign photographers who portray them as sad, Nguy·ªÖn Ho√†i Linh (b. 1967) whose The Red River Delta (1995 ‚Äì 2005) series is an investigation of the region his family was displaced from, Maika Elan (born Nguy·ªÖn Thanh H·∫£i) (b. 1986) who depicts the lives of homosexual couples in The Pink Choice (2011 ‚Äì 2012), and Lam Hieu Thuan (b. 1973) who was a student of B√πi and documents the changes in the architectural landscape of Ho Chi Minh city since ƒê·ªïi M·ªõi in Apartments (2005 ‚Äì 2006). Vi·ªát Ki·ªÅu artists In addition to reimagining the genres of photography, Contemporary art practices particularly by Vi·ªát Ki·ªÅu artists have used found images as a medium. Perhaps the most well-known practice is by Dinh Q. L√™ (b. 1968), who moved back to Vietnam in 1996 from California. His work such as From Vietnam to Hollywood (2003 ‚Äì 2005) weaves together documentary photography images from the Second Indochina War into three- dimensional tapestries. Dinh along with other Vi·ªát Ki·ªÅu artists such as Tiffany Chung, Tuan Andrew Nguyen, and Phunam founded S√†n Art in 2007. As a nonprofit Contemporary art library and exhibition space in Ho Chi Minh city, S√†n Art seeks to create opportunities for discourse around art-making practices and has become an important part of the Vietnamese arts ecosystem. Another notable Vi·ªát Ki·ªÅu photographer is Richard Streitmatter-Tran (b. 1972), whose works critique the use of Agent Orange by American troops. The Loudest Sound (2005) features diptychs of Vietnamese people in their usual attire and then in orange suits similar to the suits worn by prisoners in Abu Ghraib prison. Friction exists between Vi·ªát Ki·ªÅu and local-born artists, who have criticised their return to Vietnam as being self-motivated, in search for more reference materials to work with.

After loans spells with Arthurlie and Hamilton Academical, he left the club and embarked on a nomadic playing career that included spells in Ireland, Switzerland and the English Football League. Career After playing for junior side Denny Hibernian, McNally joined Celtic and made his professional debut on 9 April 1927 in a 3‚Äì3 draw with Dundee United. At the start of the following season, he was loaned to Scottish Second Division side Arthurlie. On 1 October 1927, he scored eight goals in a single match during a 10‚Äì0 victory over Armadale, the joint record for the most goals scored by a single player in a Scottish Football League match. After a prolific season with Arthurlie, he returned to Celtic for the 1927‚Äì28 season.

At the time of its writing he was 83 years old and knew that he was coming to the end of his life: the work is a kind of philosophical testament. Like many other works by Voltaire, it is written in the tradition of Socratic dialogue, where the interlocutors seek the truth together. Arguments The imagined dialogue takes place between two historical figures, Euhemerus and Callicrates. Euhemerus, a Stoic, was a contemporary of Alexander the Great, remembered mostly for his view that the Classical Greek gods had originally been people, deified long after their deaths by their followers. Callicrates was also a philosopher, from the third century BC, of whom little is known but whom Voltaire makes an Epicurean. His views, including atheism, are meant to represent the views of Voltaire's contemporaries Holbach, La Mettrie and Diderot. In the dialogue as in historic reality Euhemeros had enjoyed a life of travel, much of it following Alexander; Callicrates is curious to know what his friend has learned as a result of these experiences. The conversations that follow are set out in twelve dialogues: There are two main themes in the dialogues. The first six consider metaphysical questions such as whether we have a soul, whether God exists and, if he does, who is responsible for all the misery on earth. And the last six dialogues are about natural philosophy and the material world - what we know about the cosmos, the earth, the creation of mountains, and the generation of new life. What all the dialogues have in common is an appeal for modesty and restraint in argument. There is little we can undubitably know and much is hidden from us. For this reason, whatever we may believe, we should never ignore evidence or assumptions from outside the universe of our beliefs; rather than proclaiming dogmas we should engage in dialogue. At the same time, Euhemerus is unsparing in his attacks on atheists, atomists and materialists as well as on religious dogma - all of which he terms 'madness, misery and crime'. The dialogues offer an overview of Voltaire's life of thought. Euhemerus is effectively Voltaire's mouthpiece; he has seen the follies, delusions and misery of mankind. Much of the dialogue focuses on paradox of God's goodness and the misery on earth. Euhemerus draws hope from scientific progress that points to a future world built on rationality. Eventually Callicrates decides to embark on a journey of his own to the barbarian lands from which his friend had learned so much. Censorship and the first edition Voltaire's 94-page autographed manuscript still survives (pages 37‚Äì40 are not in his hand). However Voltaire's surviving correspondence makes no reference to the work, its development, or the ideas it elaborates. Likewise Grimm does not mention it. The M√©moires secrets from November 1777 did refer to the work however, and a comment from Jean-Louis Wagni√®re indicated that the Dialogues had been published only shortly before. Over the course of his life Voltaire had had his works condemned or banned by royal censors in France on many occasions. He also had a number of ways of avoiding censorship - including arranging for his work to be printed outside France, and having it printed anonymously so he could deny authorship. Indeed, the presentation of challenging or radical ideas in the form of a dialogue was one method of bringing unconventional ideas to public attention while being less likely to have the word altered or suppressed. The frontispiece of the first known edition of the Dialogues d'Evh√©m√®re indicates that it was published in London by Voltaire not in 1777 as suggested by the M√©moires secrets but in 1779 (i.e. the year after Voltaire's death), but does not name a publisher. In fact it is evident from the distinctive typography used that it was printed not in London but in Lausanne, by Abraham-Louis Tarin, who worked for the publisher Fran√ßois Grasset. Grasset is noted for having previously published a number of works attacking Voltaire as well as for having on several occasions clashed with him over the intended publication of Voltaire's works from unauthorised manuscript versions.

She was one of the first four women to be elected to the Folketing (the Danish national parliament) in 1918. Biography Born in Copenhagen on 21 April 1884, Helga Petersen was the daughter of Marie Sofie Petersen (1869‚Äì1920) who worked in a brewery and had attempted to organize her colleagues in a trade union branch for female brewery workers. Brought up in a poor home, from the age of nine, Petersen had to work after school for six hours a day to make ends meet. Unable to follow a formal education, Petersen followed in her mother's footsteps as a brewery worker. From 1903 to 1906, she was appointed cashier in Copenhagen's newly founded Kvindelige Bryggeriarbejderforbund (Female Brewery Workers Union), providing her with experience of trade union management. In 1907, she married Christian Larsen (1879‚Äì1920) who was employed by the tramcar authority. The following year, her colleagues invited her to chair the union. She went on to join the board of Dansk Bryggeri-, Br√¶nderi- og Mineralvandsarbejderforbund, the national union for brewers, distillers and mineral water workers, a position she maintained until 1927 when she had to leave over a misunderstanding about a loan. From 1913 to 1944, she was a member of the Citizens' Representation for the Social Democrats, becoming a member of the local council from 1944 to 1946. She also participated in activities in support of child care and housing for the poor. In 1918, standing in Copenhagen for the Social Democrats, Larsen was one of the first four women to be elected to the Folketing. The others were Elna Munch (Social Liberals, Copenhagen), Mathilde Malling Hauschultz (Conservative People's Party, Copenhagen) and Karen Ankersted (Conservative People's Party, Aarhus). Larsen was the first working-class women in the Rigsdag and until 1936, was the only woman representing the Social Democrats. She strove for better conditions for working families, especially for single mothers and their children. Helga Larsen died in Copenhagen on 13 December 1947.

Currently, the clade includes the genera Zalambdalestes, Alymlestes, Anchilestes, Barunlestes, Kulbeckia, Zhangolestes and Zofialestes. Palaeobiology Zalambdaltestids were insectivores, having zalambdodont molars much as various modern insectivorous species. They are uniquely suited to a saltitorial, cursorial lifestyle, bearing long, semi- digitigrade limbs and a spinal column similar to that of modern lagomorphs.

He survived Auschwitz and the death march to the Baltic, with the help of his dental tools. In 1945, he then survived the Royal Air Force attack on the ocean liners turned into prison camps in the Bay of Lubeck. After the war, he settled in Boston, USA, worked as a dentist and toured to give interviews about his wartime experiences. In 1995, he published his memoirs, The Dentist of Auschwitz: A Memoir, recounting his experiences and revulsion at having to strip gold from prisoners at Auschwitz in exchange for extra provisions for his family. In 2004, with co- author Eugene Pool, he recounted the Bay of Lubeck incident in a book entitled The 100-year secret : Britain's hidden WWII massacre. Life Bronek Jaciebowicz also spelled Berek Jakubowicz, and later known as Benjamin Jacobs, was born in 1919. In June 1941, he was a first year dental student and one of 160 men aged between 16 and 60 that were taken from the small town of Dobra in western Poland by the occupying Nazis and sent on a journey through a series of labour and concentration camps. On the advice of his mother, he carried his dental tools and despite being limited as to which procedures he could perform, he became known as \\"the dentist\\" and was sought after for his treatments. He performed simple dental procedures including draining a fistula and cleaning gums with iodine. His bright red box, containing his dental tools, became \\"his passport to survival\\". At Buchenwald and Mittelbau-Dora concentration camps, he was involved in building V-1 flying bombs and V-2 rockets. Once at Auschwitz with his father and brother (Josek), he was appointed to the dental station to treat SS men and was also given the job of extracting gold from prison corpses. It was hard to do and he recounted \\"I heard the voices of broken hearts and crushed souls\\". He also witnessed the selection processes and labouring in the mines. Despite saving extra rations for his family, his father died. At Auschwitz, he also crossed paths with Adolf Eichmann. Jacobs has been recalled in the memoirs of Sam Pivnik, another Holocaust survivor who described his experiences at F√ºrstengrube subcamp. He survived the Royal Air Force attack on the ocean liners turned into prison camps, the SS Cap Arcona, SS Thielbek and the SS Deutschland in the Bay of Lubeck in 1945. After the Second World War was over, Jacobs toured the United States and other places to share his experiences and speak of the people he had tried to help, but did not write his memoirs until he was in his eighties. At the time, he was suffering from cancer of the throat. The Dentist of Auschwitz: A Memoir Jacobs wrote his memoirs which were published by the University Press of Kentucky in 1995. The Dentist of Auschwitz: A Memoir recounts his experiences and revulsion at having to strip gold from prisoners at Auschwitz in exchange for extra provisions for his family. The book has been acknowledged as a unique witness account of the \\"perverted way of life\\" at Auschwitz and has been used as a case study to examine the traumas and ethical dilemmas faced by Jews who held \\"privileged\\" positions in the ghettos and concentration camps. The memoirs were published by the University Press of Kentucky in 1995 and consist of 20 chapters. He writes in the book that \\"Jews were verbally abused and often beaten in broad daylight\\". It has been described as a \\"hard read\\", but a valuable first-hand testimony of dentistry in Auschwitz. Defined as having \\"Wieselian darkness\\", it has been compared to Night, a novella by Elie Weisel. The 100-year secret : Britain's hidden WWII massacre Jacobs and Eugene Pool authored The 100-year secret : Britain's hidden WWII massacre, published by The Lyons Press in 2004, in which Jacobs gives a first hand account of the Cap Arcona disaster, one of a few known memoirs of the incident.Watson, Robert P.

These coffins are known from finds secreted in churches, as well as from references to their use in folk magic at other locations. Overview Burials of frogs in miniature coffins were (re)discovered in churches in eastern Finland around the turn of the twentieth century, and were briefly recorded by , who explained them as placed objects with a magical purpose of the stealing the luck of more successful fishermen. A typical size for the coffin was long. Churches where such coffins were found include Kuopio Cathedral (about 32 coffins); Tuusniemi Church (about 100 coffins); Kiihtelysvaara Church (4 coffins); Pielavesi Old Church (coffin and bound frogs); coffins and bound frogs have also been found at Nilsi√§ Old Church; Hein√§vesi Old Church; Turku Cathedral; and Church (in Sweden) ‚Äì along with the coffins other finds included puppets made of alder or birch bark, parts of fishing nets, and textiles. =Physical finds= One such find were the coffins found during restoration work in the choir of Kuopio Cathedral, recorded in the newspaper ' in 1895 ‚Äì the cathedral itself was consecrated in 1816 ‚Äì according to the report in Savo-Karjala the 'coffins' had been pushed into the space through ventilation hatches. At the time of discovery some of the coffins were relatively new. Five further coffins were found in 1901, and the find recorded in Savo-Karjala again ‚Äì the newspaper surmised from the number that the coffins were being added yearly. Two coffins were kept by the National Museum of Finland in Helsinki, and another in the Kuopio Museum ‚Äì features of these offerings were ‚Äì a coffin carved from alder wood; a frog inside the coffin; fishing net covering or wrapping the frog; a needle impaling the frog with white thread in the needle; in one case it is thought the frog's mouth had been stitched shut. Finds with very similar features were found in 1907 at the church in Tuusniemi (b.1869). At the same church similar coffins were found in 1818 in the church's bell tower- these coffins also contained bedbugs, animal hair, or grains. Another find was made in the 1930s under the churches stone foundation. Possibly related finds include a cat in an alder coffin at Kiihtelysvaara Church, and alder coffins (about ) containing a carved human figure found at The Old Church of Pielavesi. Whilst most coffins have been found in eastern Finland an example has been found in the west at Turku Cathedral ‚Äì this deposit was a 'high quality' work was made of varnished pine with cloth, and the initials 'HM' on the base. Radiocarbon dating, building history, and style have dated this coffin to the late 17th century or early 18th century. =Folklore= There is extensive recorded folklore concerning the placement of frogs in coffins in eastern Finland, including central Finland, Savo, Karelia, North Ostrobothnia, Kainuu, and as far north as south Lapland ‚Äì these areas are mostly Lutheran in modern religion, except Karelia which is Orthodox. Generally the burial of a miniature coffin is a key part of the ritual. The majority of recorded lore is about counter-magic ‚Äì intended to reflect evil intentions back to the those sending them. A lesser part of recorded rituals are malicious in intent ‚Äì the ritual may be similar to the counter-magic one, but include the burial of an item from the victim in the coffin, though the intent of ritual is also key. In these rituals frogs are the commonest animal (about 70%) though others may be used including squirrels, pike, or even a human foetus. Animal substances (milk, feathers, hooves etc.) may have also been buried in a miniature coffin. In recorded folklore accounts it was thought that such a practise was powerful magic, and could kill an intended victim. Other spells or rituals could be healing, such as a cure for epilepsy which included burying a piece of the afflicted's undergarments with a frog coffin ‚Äì this cure likely was another form of a protective 'reflective' spell, with the illness assumed caused by malicious sorcery. For example:, in a ritual to dispel the problem of cows not returning home at night, recorded from the cunning man Mikko Koljonen (born 1812) of Viitasaari: A ritual against epilepsy also use a 'frog coffin' ‚Äì it gives one ritual by which such coffins might end deposited in churches : Christian interpretations and influence Both the malicious intent of 'frog coffin' rituals, and also those intended to 'reflect' evil intent back on the sender were at odds with the Christian world view of forgiveness, though the protective use against other persons' malice could co-exist to some extent as it did not harm the innocent. Contemporary newspaper reports of finds of such burials were scathing of such practises occurring and continuing to occur. notes the use of Christian holy places as geographic focuses for non-Christian practices. It is thought that the V√§ki ('Power') for these spells may have come from the dead associated with the church and churchyard. In some cases miniature coffin rituals included elements of Christian practice, such as reciting parts of the Lord's Prayer, but not performed by a priest. In other cultures The Zhuang people of China idolize the frog ‚Äì on the first day of the Lunar Year a societal ritual (\\"Yaogui\\") takes place including a hunt for hibernating frogs (\\"Gui\\"), and their sacrifice and placing in a coffin (of a Bamboo section). On the 25th day after the sacrifice, the frog's bones are exhumed and used to foretell the next harvest.

It belongs to the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB) and is located in the cantons of St. Gallen and the Grisons.  History= 19th century= Photograph from 1923 with station (right) and Heerbrugg palace (left) Steam trains at the 150th anniversary of the Rhine line with Ec 3/5 and E 3/3 between Au and St. Margrethen The construction of the Rhine valley line was started by the Southeastern Railway (Schweizerische S√ºdostbahn), which sought to build a railway through the Lukmanier Pass. The first work, which was carried out by English contractors, was unsatisfactory. Due to a lack of financial resources, the Southeastern Railway was taken over during the construction by the United Swiss Railways (Vereinigte Schweizerbahnen, VSB), which continued the work without interruption. The VSB opened the section from Rorschach to Rheineck on 25 August 1857 and the section from Rheineck to Chur on 1 July 1858. Sargans station was opened as a junction station with the station building between the diverging lines along with the section of the Ziegelbr√ºcke‚ÄìSargans railway to Murg on 15 February 1859. In the same year, the VSB took over the continuous operation of the line via Ziegelbr√ºcke and Rapperswil to Z√ºrich. Since then, the section between Sargans and Chur has served traffic from both Z√ºrich and St. Gallen. The Rhine valley line would have become a lucrative access route if an eastern Alpine railway crossing had been built. = 20th century= The VSB was nationalised with a route length of 269 kilometres on 1 July 1902 and its routes have since belonged to the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB). Ragaz Until 1928, the railway line between Maienfeld and Bad Ragaz crossed the Rhine with a covered timber bridge, it was the last of its kind in the Swiss railway network. The Sargans‚ÄìBuchs was electrified at 15 kV 16‚Öî Hz on 15 December 1927 as part of the ongoing electrification program of the SBB. About six months later, on 11 May 1928, electric operations started on the Sargans‚ÄìChur section. The section from St. Margrethen to Rorschach was electrified on 15 May 1934 and the last section from Buchs to St. Margrethen was wired on 21 September 1934. A second track was put into operation between St. Margrethen and Rheineck on 1 December 1920. The Staad‚ÄìRorschach section was duplicated on 15 May 1930 and the Rheineck‚ÄìStaad section on 12 August 1930. The line between Sargans and Bad Ragaz has been duplicated since 20 December 1957. The line between Landquart and Chur was duplicated between 15 December 1970 and 10 April 1973. The line from Weite-Wartau to Tr√ºbbach was duplicated on 17 September 1982. The new track was commissioned on 1 September and the old track was then refurbished. Source: A new 5.3 kilometre-long loop between Sargans and Tr√ºbbach was opened together with the partial commissioning of a new signalling system in Sargans station on 29 May 1983. This connecting loop was constructed for freight traffic and allows trains to avoid reversing in Sargans. However, it is also used by services on line 4 of the St. Gallen S-Bahn, Transalpin services and, subsequently, Railjet services. The Rossriet‚ÄìLandquart sections was duplicated on 6 June 1993 and the Bad Ragaz‚ÄìRossriet was duplicated on 8 November 1994. Since then, duplication of the line between Sargans and Chur has been completed. The line between St. Margrethen and Buchs is still single-track. = 21st century= Rheintal- Express between Tr√ºbbach and Sargans upright At the 2013 timetable change, the range of InterRegio and Regional services were comprehensively expanded and the lines of the St. Gallen S-Bahn were completely rearranged. Since then, the St Gallen and Sargans junctions have formed the basis for the S-Bahn timetable, which offers half-hourly services on virtually all lines, with extras services in the core area. Infrastructure upgrades were necessary to make the new timetable possible. The travel time of the Rheintal-Express (REX) was shortened by ten minutes to just under an hour, so that better connections could be offered in Sargans and Chur. This required an acceleration of the Rheintal-Express, an increase in running speeds on the section to 160 km/h and the dropping of intermediate stops. In addition to the stop in St. Gallen St. Fiden there are also stops in Rheineck and Bad Ragaz. Three stations were closed between Buchs SG and Sargans: , , and .  Route description Railjet passing through the then station of Weite The Chur‚ÄìRorschach line is an important rail link in the canton of St. Gallen. It runs through the Chur and St. Gallen sections of the Rhine valleys from Chur to Rheineck and on to Rorschach. The Rhine valley line begins in Chur railway station, where the standard gauge line connects with the dual gauge Domat/Ems‚ÄìChur line of the Rhaetian Railway (RhB). The route initially runs parallel to the Chur‚ÄìLandquart line of the RhB north to Haldenstein, from where the two lines run to Zizers between the Rhine and the A13 motorway. From Zizers, the SBB line runs directly to Landquart, where it again meets the RhB line to Davos, which has detoured via Igis. Between Maienfeld and Bad Ragaz, the Rhine valley line crosses the A13 and the Rhine, which at this point forms the canton border between the Grisons and St. Gallen. The section to Maienfeld is the only standard gauge line in the Grisons. From Bad Ragaz the trains run parallel to the A13 to Sargans station, where the line splits to Z√ºrich and St. Gallen. Stadler KISS (class RABe 511) running as the Rheintal-Express Chur‚ÄìWil at a stop in St. Margrethen. Sargans, the starting point for the measurement of the line-kilometrage (chainage), follows a junction with the Sargans loop (Sargans Schleife), which allows trains coming from Ziegelbr√ºcke to proceed to Tr√ºbbach next to the A13, avoiding the need to reverse in Sargans. A short double track section between Tr√ºbbach and Neugr√ºt allows train crossings, otherwise the line to St. Margrethen is single-track. It no longer runs along the A13 and the Rhine, but has its own route between the motorway and the valley slope. In Buchs, the Rhine valley line meets the line from Feldkirch of the Austrian Federal Railways (√ñBB). Trains coming from Sargans and continuing over the Arlberg Railway have to reverse in Buchs, which in the case of freight trains, requires a locomotive change. From Buchs to Oberriet the Rhine valley line more or less follows the Werdenberger and Rheintaler canals and main road 13 as far as Altst√§tten. The Altst√§tten‚ÄìGais railway of the Appenzell Railways (AB) has ended in Altst√§tten Stadt since 1975. Since then the connection between the two Altst√§tt stations has been provided by a short bus line operated by the Rheintalische Verkehrsbetriebe (Rhine Valley Transport Company). The Rhine Valley line runs directly to Au and meets and runs along the inland canal and the St. Margrethen motorway, where it connects with the Bregenz line of the √ñBB. As the SBB and √ñBB have the same electrical system, there is often no change in traction for international trains in St. Margrethen. The EuroCity services running from Z√ºrich via St. Gallen to Munich are hauled to Lindau by class Re 421 locomotives registered in Germany and Austria. DB Cargo operates its freight trains on the Kornwestheim‚ÄìRorschach‚ÄìWolfurt route with its own Swiss-made TRAXX (class 185) locomotives. From St. Margrethen to Rheineck, the now double-track line follows the A1 and the Alter Rhein (old Rhine). In Rheineck, the Rheineck‚ÄìWalzenhausen mountain railway of the AB connects to the Vorderland mountain resort. The Rhine valley line runs to Staad and along the shore of Lake Constance to Rorschach, where SBB services continue on the line to St. Gallen or the line to Romanshorn and AB services run on the line to Heiden.  Operations Stadler FLIRT sets of the S√ºdostbahn are operated on the circular line S4 Since 13 December 2009, two of the three daily EuroCitys to and from Austria have been replaced by Railjet services. This saves a total of 40 minutes running time between Z√ºrich and Vienna, due, among other things, to having faster turnarounds in Buchs. The third train, the former Transalpin service, was also replaced by a Railjet service in June 2010, but, unlike the first two, runs as two coupled sets. Nine day and night trains a day connect Z√ºrich with Austria, all with stops in Sargans and Buchs. The section from Rorschach to St. Margrethen is served four times a day by a EuroCity service on the Z√ºrich‚ÄìMunich route. Rheintal Express (REX) services now run between Chur and St. Gallen every hour. Between Sargans and Rorschach, line S4 St Gallen S-Bahn services operated by S√ºdostbahn also run every hour on a circular route with stops at all stations. Between Altst√§tten and St. Gallen the line is served by lines S1 and S2 of the S-Bahn. Overall, this results in two trains per hour between St. Gallen and Altst√§tten and three between Heerbrugg and St. Gallen. On the Sargans‚ÄìChur section the good connections from Z√ºrich on two InterCity services and a RegioExpress are supplemented by the S12 (Sargans‚ÄìChur) service. = Freight traffic= Freight traffic is heavy between Sargans and Buchs, because this is the transit route to the Vorarlberg and to the rest of Austria. The trains from France (Mulhouse) and the Limmattal marshalling yard (west of Z√ºrich) to the Hall in Tirol marshalling yard use the route through the Buchs border crossing. The crossing at St. Margrethen is only used by trains to and from the Wolfurt marshalling yard. The Buchs marshalling yard serves the whole Swiss Rhine valley. Since 2004 DB Cargo has been operating freight trains from Stuttgart Kornwestheim via the electrified Lake Line and then via Rorschach and St. Margrethen to the Wolfurt marshalling yard to avoid the use of diesel locomotives on the Lake Constance Belt Railway and the Ulm‚ÄìFriedrichshafen railway.

It was built from 1853 to 1854 for Joseph George Raphael. It is also known as The Rocks Toy Museum, Unwin's Coach House, Coach House, and The Coachhouse. The property is owned by Property NSW, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002.  History  The Raphael Mackeller Stores were reputedly erected as stores and possibly as stables and later used for small-scale manufacturing activities. Vacated in the 1980s the buildings were left disused for several years. The buildings still contain some machinery related to their former manufacturing and/or store functions. Although commonly known and referred to in the past as \\"The Coach House\\", the doorways and the lane access are barely adequate for manoeuvring a horse and cart or coach, making it unlikely that the building was ever used as a coach house. The Raphael Mackeller Stores are two narrow stone buildings facing Kendall Lane. They were built along the rear boundary of the properties now called Nos. 77, 79 and 81 George Street North (earlier known as Nos. 81, 83 and 85 George Street respectively), being Unwin's Stores. The Raphael Mackeller Stores is generally considered as separate from the George Street properties it is purported to have originally served. The subject land was originally granted to Captain John Piper in June 1828 by Lieutenant General Ralph Darling, Governor of the Colony. The allotment was part of the Sydney Hospital's stage 2 plan in the 1790s. When the land was not required for future extensions, William Balmain was granted a lease on the property and by 1807 he had surrendered the lease to the NSW Government. Frederick Wright Unwin gained title to the land in 1839, and his subdivision of 1841 included these properties. Construction proper of the shops and houses fronting George Street commenced a few years earlier in 1843 by Unwin. No. 85 George Street was completed in November 1844 and No. 79 George Street was finished in the later half of 1845. Dr Frederick Mackellar purchased the four tenements in February 1853 for ¬£2,100 and his trustees re- leased the buildings to the Crown and the then NSW Minister for Public Works in December 1902 for the sum of ¬£5,932/15/4. The Mackeller Store located to the rear of 79-81 George Street was erected in 1853-4 by Dr Frederick Mackeller, physician and surgeon and owner of 79-81 George Street, as an extension of the original store building (Raphael Stores) built to the rear of 77 George Street. The Raphael Store (at the rear of 77 George Street) was built in 1853 as store/warehouse. It was probably built for Joseph George Raphael, a merchant, publican, clothier, seaman's shipping agent, member of the NSW Parliament, and owner of 77 George Street. The building was constructed around the southern wall and chimney of Samson's Cottage (partially demolished). The present Samson's Cottage was rebuilt in 1991 to the same configuration. The close match in style and construction between the two sections (Raphael and Mackeller Stores) suggests a close cooperation between the owners and possibly the same builder. For most of its history the Raphael Mackeller Stores were occupied by tenants of Unwin's Stores, including several Chinese businesses. In 1860 Nom, Hing & Co., Chinese merchants were the tenants. In 1864 Henry Murray, grocer was a part tenant followed by in 1865 Nom, Who & Co. and from 1866-1868 Chin Long was the storekeeper. The most recent tenant before the original conservation and adaptive reuse works in the late 1980s was Stanton Catchlove & Co who moved into 2 Kendall Lane in 1930 and manufactured sheep dip and soft soap. The company gradually took over 4 Kendall Lane from 1932 to 1936. They also ran a ship's chandlery from 1946. Stanton Catchlove moved out in 1986 and in 1990 was operating in Alexandria. By May 2005, the Raphael Mackeller Stores was in use as the Rocks Toy Museum. This involved extensive conservation and adaptive reuse of the building to accommodate modern services and fitout occurring in 1988- 1990. In 2005, the Raphael Mackeller Stores were once again converted to accommodate the Rocks Discovery Museum (opened in December 2005), at which time, further conservation and interpretation works occurred.Conybeare Morrison 2006  Description  The Raphael Mackeller Stores or Coach House is a narrow stone building facing Kendall Lane. It was built along the rear boundary of properties now called Nos. 77, 79 and 81 George Street North (earlier known, as Nos. 81, 83 and 85 George Street, respectively). The Coach House is now generally considered as separate from the George Street properties it originally served, and is now usually referred to as the Coach House or as Nos. 2 & 4 Kendall Lane. The justification for the \\"Coach House\\" name is fairly tenuous, but it seems to be the currently accepted name and so is used here as well. The Coach House was reputedly erected as a store and stables over the period 1853-1854. It was later used for small-scale manufacturing activity, but was vacated in the 1980s and left disused. It still contains some machinery related to its former manufacturing and/or store functions. The doorways and the lane access are barely adequate for manoeuvring a horse and cart, let alone a coach, making it unlikely that the building was ever used as a coach house. The three storey sandstone coach house was built in two stages. The first part on 77 George Street was built in 1853 and the second part on 79 George Street was built to the south in 1853-54. This is visible from the continuous vertical joint that runs along the western and eastern facades of the building. The rough face sandstone block walls have six loading bays on the first and second floors, with three on the ground floor and one on Kendall Lane. The doors are framed and braced and all have hardwood lintels. Two cat head beams are at roof level to the north and middle doors projecting through above the loading bays. A pulley mechanism remains over the top level northern door. A corrugated iron gable roof has capped sandstone gable ends at the north and south ends of the building and over the continuous joint in the Kendall Lane Coachhouse at the boundary between Nos 77 and 79-81 George Street. The north wall is the original sandstone wall to the 1844 Samson's Cottage.Tropman 1989: 34 =Industrial archaeology=Lineshafting and Associated Motor Drive At ground floor level of No. 2 Kendall Lane, there is a short lineshaft mounted high on the east wall, near the ceiling. The shaft has a diameter of and is approximately long. It is mounted in four plain sleeve metal (probably brass) bearings on four fabricated steel cantilever brackets attached to the east wall, with the axis of the shaft at approximately out from the wall, and approximately above the uneven floor. The shaft has five pulleys for use with flat leather belts, but all of the belts have gone. Three of the pulleys are solid discs made of laminated wood, and the other two (larger) pulleys have laminated wood rims and wooden spokes. The pulleys are (from north to south end of the shaft): (a) diameter (spoked) x face width; (b) diameter (spoked) x face width; (c) diameter (solid) x face width; (d) diameter (solid) x face width; (e) diameter (solid) x face width; The largest pulley, (a), is at the northern end of the shaft, in line with the motor pulley, and was obviously used for the flat belt transferring mechanical power from the electric motor to the shaft. The smallest pulley,(e), is located at the southern end of the lineshaft, directly beneath a hole in the floor above, and was used for a belt transmitting power from the lineshaft to a small mixing machine at first (middle) floor level, used by Stanton Catchlove for making semi-liquid soap. The other three pulleys are located in between (a) and (e), and were used for flat belt drives to other machinery (since removed) at ground floor level, mainly mixing machines for making much sheep dip and soft soap, again for Stanton Catchlove. The shaft was probably installed in by Vita-Lick, or in by Stanton Catchlove, and was certainly used for many years by Catchlove. However, the pulleys look much older than 1930, and it is possible that the shaft was installed earlier, or that the pulleys were second-hand from some other site. The motor for driving the lineshaft was tucked beneath a wooden staircase at the northern end of the ground floor area, and is partly guarded (for operator safety) by a roughly made chain-wire mesh screen. The motor was a relatively modern \\"C & W' Type A, 3 phase AC, , variable speed, 550-1950 rpm, electric motor, made by Charles and Hunting, Melbourne. The motor ran at constant speed internally, but the output shaft speed is set at any speed between 550 rpm and 1950 rpm by varying the setting of internal intermediate conical drive pulleys. The internal conical drive setting, and hence output speed, is varied by means of a handwheel and flexible shaft connected to the motor easing. The pulley on the motor output shaft is cast-iron, diameter x face width, indicating that the lineshaft ran at a modest 80 to 280 rpm. Mixer At middle floor level in the north section of the Coach House (No. 2 Kendall Lane), there is a small mixing machine which was used by Stanton Catchlove & Co. for making semi-liquid soap. The machine has a cylindrical sheet-metal drum, about diameter x tall, with an open top and a lift-off thin pressed-metal lid, like a billy lid. The drum has a hemispherical bottom in which three concentric sets of circular mixing blades revolved, each set consisting of six semicircular rods spaced 60 degrees apart. The blades are on a short horizontal shaft connected by gears to an upper shaft which carries a pair of flat-belt pulleys. The upper shaft also acts as a pivot on which the drum could be tilted to discharge the contents. Power was provided by a continuously running flat leather belt, which came up through a hole in the floor from the ground-floor lineshaft immediately beneath the mixer, and passed around the machine's pulleys. A handle with metal prongs enabled the mixer operator to slide the belt onto one pulley which was keyed to the gear shaft, and which then drove the mixing blades, or to slide the moving belt onto the second pulley which was not keyed but which rotated freely on the shaft and allowed the blades to stop. The combination of motor speed range, pulley sizes, and gearing ratio, gives the mixer blades a theoretical speed of 70 rpm to 250 rpm. The mixer was probably installed by Catchlove on occupying the Coach House in , but might have been in use earlier at their previous premises. The machine had no visible brand, but appeared to be a \\"mass\\" produced mixer rather than a one-off custom-made item. It resembles a food mixer, and it is likely that the blades could be removed for cleaning. The drum appears to be made of tin-plated or galvanised sheet steel, with some of the galvanizing or plating flaking off. More sturdy brackets, pivots etc., are riveted to the outside of the drum at strategic locations. The drum still contains a residue of (presumably) soap. The whole mixer is very dirty, but in fairly intact condition, except that the drive belt is missing, and a drain cock has been removed from a threaded outlet at the bottom of the drum. Winch and Catshead Pulley A large manually- powered winch is bolted to the top floor of the north section of the Coach House (No. 2 Kendall Lane), just inside and facing the top loading doorway over Kendall Lane. The winch has a fairly modern steel wire cable wrapped around the winching drum. The free end of the cable passes out through a small hole above the loading doors, passes over a pulley attached to the external catshead beam protruding above the doorway, and ends with a hook. The winch and hook were obviously intended for hoisting heavy loads from the laneway up to the middle or upper floor levels, or for lowering loads to the laneway. The load rating of the winch, cable and catshead beam, is not visible, although a safe load rating is normally required to be clearly displayed next to any lifting device. Such a notice may have been removed, but possibly the winch was never inspected after the relevant regulations came into force. The winch has a pair of A-shaped cast-iron side frames, marked with the name of the manufacturer, \\"BROWN LENOX & Co, LONDON\\". The frames are joined by three horizontal tie rods with threaded ends, which pass through holes at the apex and at each foot of the A-frame, and are secured by square nuts. Also mounted horizontally between the pair of A-frames are the cast-iron winch drum (near the centre of the frame), a winding handle shaft, and an intermediate gear shaft (both near the apex of the frame, which is at about waist height). At one end of the winch drum there is a large 64 or 65 tooth gear wheel. Above that is a much smaller 10 tooth pinion gear on the winding handle shaft, which has a large crank handle at each end, enabling the pinion gear to be turned by two men. Normally, the small pinion gear would be engaged directly with the large drum gear, and about 6.5 turns of the handles would be required to get one turn of the winch drum. Next to the handle shaft is another shaft with a set of 24 tooth and 10 tooth intermediate gears, which are normally disengaged and sitting idle, but which, by a simple arrangement, can be slid across to be interposed as a second reduction stage between the handle pinion gear and the main drum gear. This gives extra gear reduction, so that about 15.5 turns of the handles are needed for one turn of the drum. Engaging the intermediate gears allows much heavier loads to be lifted occasionally, although they would be raised more slowly, a versatile arrangement well suited to a small store like this one. On the side of the main drum gear there is a narrow brake drum, around which is wrapped a brake band. The upper end of the brake band is attached to a fixed pin in the top of one leg of the A-frame side casting. The lower end of the band is connected to a long lever, allowing the operator to apply considerable tension to the brake band, and thus control the lowering of the load. If preferred, one or both winding handles could be removed to stop them spinning during lowering of the load. The nuts or threaded knobs which were used to secure the handles to the shaft have been lost, but the handles are still in place. At the opposite end of the drum there is a toothed ratchet which originally had a pawl to engage it, to lock the drum and the load in a fixed position. The engaging pawl has gone, and several teeth of the ratchet are broken, indicating that there were problems with the pawl breaking or not engaging properly, and the load getting away. The floor beneath the winch is strengthened locally by two cross-planks, held by the same bolts which secure the feet of the winch to the floor joists. Above the winch there is a makeshift wire tie from the winch to the overhead roof truss. the purpose of the tie is unclear, but possibly it was intended to prevent the floor shaking during hoisting, or possibly there was some concern that the winch might fall through the floor. The date of installation of this winch has not been determined, but winches of a very similar type can be seen in a photograph of railway construction work, and in a photograph of a water reservoir being built. It is quite likely that this Coach House winch is of about the same vintage, i.e. about 100 years old. It has been in the same location since first installed in the building. The date of its installation is not known. It may have been installed new in the 1880s or 1890s, but equally may have been moved in from another location by a later tenant. =Summary of the building fabric= Style: Colonial; Storeys: Three; Facade: Sandstone; Roof: Slate on timber truss; Floor: Stone flagging on ground floor, timber boarding on timber framing first and second. = Condition = As at 25 May 2006, major conservation works .

Heritage listing  As at 29 January 2009, the Raphael Mackeller Stores are a rare surviving example of stores with workshops for light industry above located in Sydney and dating from the 1850s period. It has state historical significance for the industrial usage associated with The Rocks as an inner city commercial precinct of Sydney with the light manufacturing usages continuing in the mid 1980s. As part of the Kendall Lane/Unwin Stores Precinct and The Rocks as a whole it conveys very clearly the character of Sydney's mid to late 19th century period of development. The exterior and interiors of the building are of state aesthetic significance and the buildings hold research potential in retaining many original or later finishes and fixtures which interpret its industrial nature. The late nineteenth century catshead beams and pulley are rare surviving examples in their original location. The Raphael Mackeller Stores and site are of state heritage significance for their historical and scientific cultural values. The site and building are also of state heritage significance for their contribution to The Rocks area which is of state heritage significance in its own right. The Raphael Mackeller Stores or Coach House was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Raphael Mackeller Stores has historic value because of its immediate visual association with an early phase of Sydney's history. The coach house is associated with a very historic precinct of Sydney, George Street, The Rocks, indicating early commercial activity.Tropman 1989 The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The Raphael Mackeller Stores is associated with the merchants and professionals Frederick Mackellar (solicitor, father of long-term parliamentarian Sir Charles Mackellar and grandfather of poet Dorothea Mackellar), Joseph George Raphael (merchant, seaman shipping agent, clothier, publican and member of NSW parliament) and Frederic Wright Unwin, who were all instrumental in the early development of the commercial precinct of George Street North and Kendall Lane. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The Raphael Mackeller Stores is a well detailed colonial sandstone three storey building which is relatively intact and has had sympathetic restoration works carried out. It is an extremely significant townscape element to Kendall Lane portraying the original form, scale, detail and material of the 1850s. The internal layout has been largely untouched and hence portrays the full character of the building. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Raphael Mackeller Stores have social significance as an important feature in The Rocks Conservation Area, and contributes strongly to the character of The Rocks. The Raphael Mackeller Stores are held in high esteem as indicated by their listings on the State Heritage Register, the National Trust register and the now defunct Register of the National Estate, and thus is recognised by an identifiable group/s and has importance to the broader community. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The construction of the Raphael Mackeller Stores indicates the early method of building and finishing in the 1850s, using hardwood flooring, beams, columns and sandstone block walls. The common wall between the south and north parts also indicates the practice of using adjacent boundary walls where possible. The Lineshaft: The lineshaft and pulleys are typical of small-scale factories c.1900 to 1940, when electric motors were too expensive to be fitted to each individually driven machine. The arrangement with all wooden pulleys and combination of both spoked and solid wooden pulleys is fairly unusual. Although this lineshaft is not an outstanding example, it has some significance as representing a technology which was very important and is now rare. The main significance of the lineshafting is its indication that small-scale manufacturing activity was carried on in this building for more than 50 years. Soap Mixer: The mixer is not an outstanding artefact, but has a local significance as a specific reminder of one aspect of the manufacturing activities carried on in this building for more than 50 years. The mixer complements the lineshaft, being the only remaining example of the machinery previously driven by the lineshaft. Winch & Catshead Pulley: The winch and associated catshead pulley are very significant, because they represent the original and long-standing function of the Raphael Mackeller Stores as a typical small multi-storey store warranting manual-powered hoist machinery, but not warranting a major steam or hydraulically powered hoist. As such the winch and pulley are also representative of the once numerous but now rare winches of a similar type which must have operated in many other small multi-storey stores and warehouses in The Rocks and throughout the Sydney commercial and shipping district during the late 19th and early 20th century. The winches helped make the use of such stores viable. This winch is also significant for being in its working location, and in nearly complete working condition. The pulley has not been dated, but the winch is approximately 100 years old, and should certainly be considered an industrial relic. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Raphael Mackeller Stores is not uncommon or rare. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The Raphael Mackeller Stores is representative of early commercial stores constructed within the first century of European settlement in Sydney Cove. Together with the Union Bond Store and Argyle Stores located along George Street, Evans' Stores, Harrington Street and Campbell's Stores, Circular Quay West (amongst others), all built in a similar period (mid to late 1800s); the Raphael Mackeller Stores contribute to the history of The Rocks Precinct, the areas' early history of maritime based commerce and is representative of the developing economy of the young colony.

She was the first Mexican woman to host a radio program.  Early life and career  Carolina Malpica Mungu√≠a was born in Puebla, Mexico, on January 14, 1891. Her father, Patricio Malpica, was a widower. Mungu√≠a was sent to the Instituto Normal Metodista (Methodist Normal School) to be educated, despite her being a Roman Catholic. At the institute, Carolina trained as a teacher and graduated in 1911. After graduating, Mungu√≠a worked in an elementary school in Mexico. While working at the school, Mungu√≠a attended graduate classes in English and soon became the principal at a Methodist School in Orizaba, Veracruz. During the Mexican Revolution, the Methodist School Mungu√≠a was employed at was closed, leading Mungu√≠a to found her own school in her hometown of Puebla. The school, operated by Mungu√≠a, focused on education for fourth and fifth grade students before its closure. She later became the primary school supervisor for the city of Puebla.Gonzalez, Gabriela. \\"Two Flags Entwined: Transborder Activists and the Politics of Race, Ethnicity, Class, and Gender in South Texas, 1900‚Äì1950.\\" Dissertation. Stanford University, 2005. Mungu√≠a's career as an educator ended when she married Jos√© R√≥mulo Mungu√≠a Torres in 1916. The couple had seven children and remained married until their deaths. Due to Mungu√≠a's husband's controversial status as a revolutionary, the family was exiled from Mexico and moved to San Antonio, Texas, in 1926.  Later career and activism  In 1932, Mungu√≠a became the first Mexican woman to have her own radio show. Her show, La Estrella, aired on station KONO and promoted Mexican culture in San Antonio through Mexican music and literature. After the success of the radio program, Mungu√≠a helped her husband establish his own printing business in the 1930s called Mungu√≠a Printers. In her early years in San Antonio, Mungu√≠a taught Spanish at the Wesleyan Institute, which later became Trinity University. During this time she washed and shelled pecans in the Mungu√≠a home. After finding economic stability for her family, Mungu√≠a decided to become an activist for the Mexican community La Raza in San Antonio. On June 12, 1938, she started \\"C√≠rculo Social Femenino, M√©xico\\" (\\"Women's Social Circle, Mexico\\"), later renamed as \\"Circulo Cultural; Isabel La Catolica\\" (\\"Cultural Circle; Isabel the Catholic\\"). C√≠rculo Social Femenino was designed to help lower-middle-class and working-class Mexican and Mexican-American women. The slogan for the organization was ‚ÄúToda por la patria y el hogar‚Äù (\\"All for country and home\\"), designed around the revitalization of the Mexican and Mexican-American community. Circulo Cultural participated in many community projects, such as taking in donations for the poor, celebrating Mexican holidays, volunteering at the Mexican Consulate and Clinic, organizing cultural events, and raising money for community outreach. Mungu√≠a provided two Mexican lawyers to answer legal questions from members of the organization. The Circulo Cultural was active for 16 months and disbanded in the early 1940s. In 1938 she also started participating in the Asociaci√≥n de la Biblioteca Mexicana (Association of the Mexican Library), which was a project of the Mexican Consulate. After serving as a Secretary of the Crockett Latin American Parent-Teachers Association, Mungu√≠a became the Spanish- speaking PTA President in 1938, which allowed Spanish-speaking parents to bring concerns and ideas to the teachers in order to improve student education. It was during the Great Depression, so students were going to school hungry, dirty, poorly clothed, sick or injured. To meet students' basic needs, a dining room was opened, showers installed, sewing circles organized, and medical attention was given to the students. Mungu√≠a met additional needs through the \\"Home of Neighborly Service Center\\" which fed children and had Mexican-American barbers who gave the children free haircuts. During her tenure at Crockett, she had the Spanish-Speaking PTA raise money for clothes and shoes for the students and create Christmas baskets for their families. In 1940 and 1941 she moved up in the organization and became the head of the Spanish-Speaking Department of the San Antonio PTA Council in District 5. In this position, she oversaw all of the Spanish-Speaking PTAs in the district, gave speeches at seven schools, participated in Executive PTA Board meetings, founded a Spanish-Speaking PTA chapter at T. J. Brackenridge Elementary, and presented at the PTA state convention to showcase work done by Spanish- speaking students. She then joined the American Red Cross because four of her sons were fighting in World War II. In 1952 Mungu√≠a helped her husband start a cross-cultural community organization called \\"El Patronato\\" (The Board) to support extension courses offered by the National Autonomous University of Mexico in San Antonio. R√≥mulo Mungu√≠a served as the first president of the organization whose members included both Mexican-Americans and Caucasians. The continued efforts of El Patronato eventually led to the establishment of a satellite campus of UNAM in San Antonio in 1972.  Later life and legacy  Later in life, Mungu√≠a was active in the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Little Flower, which was devoted to St. Th√©rese of Lisieux. She was the grandmother of Henry Cisneros, who became the first Mexican-American mayor of San Antonio. She died on May 25, 1977, in San Antonio.

It is on the south waterfront of the Grunewaldsee and is part of the locality Dahlem in the borough Steglitz-Zehlendorf. The Jagdschloss was built in 1542/1543. Its owner was Joachim II Hector the prince-elector of the Margraviate of Brandenburg. The building was created in the Renaissance style and got the name Zum gr√ºnen Wald, \\"to the green forest\\", and gave the whole Grunewald its name. Around 1800 the ch√¢teau got the name Grunewald too. During reconstructions between 1705 and 1708 by Frederick I, the first king of Prussia, it got its Baroque design by master builder Martin Gr√ºnberg. The Jagdschloss has been administered by the Prussian Palaces and Gardens Foundation Berlin-Brandenburg since 1932 and is used as a museum. It contains paintings by Lucas Cranach the Elder, his son Lucas Cranach the Younger, and from the Netherlands and Germany from 15th to 19th century. The Jagdschloss has the sole hall in Berlin from the time of the Renaissance. Since 1977 a hunting kit collection has been established in a nearby building.  The building of Jagdschl√∂ssern under Kurf√ºrst Joachim II. Hector  Abraham Begeyn: King Frederick I on the Hunt At the beginning of the 16th century Elector Joachim II Hector began building hunting lodges in the Margraviate of Brandenburg in the wooded and wild area around Alt-Berlin and C√∂lln. In addition to existing simple hunting lodges, mostly timber framed, hunting lodges were built in B√∂tzow (later Oranienburg), in the Teltower Heide with Grunewald and in K√∂penick, Renaissance hunting lodges were built in the Renaissance style, as well as castle complexes converted for this purpose in Potsdam and Grimnitz near Joachimsthal on the edge of the Schorfheide. Of these castles from the time of Joachim II, only the Grunewald hunting lodge has survived. It was about 15 kilometer away from the electoral residence, in which a Renaissance palace was built shortly before in the years 1538 to 1540 in C√∂lln an der Spree, the predecessor of the Berlin Palace. A riding path connected the Residenz C√∂lln with the hunting area in the Teltower Heide, from 1792 Spandauer Forst, today's Grunewald. A section of the path, the street Unter den Linden, led from the city palace to the west into the electoral zoo, which was established in 1527. From there the riding path, which was laid out as a Kn√ºppeldamm (Truncheon Dam) due to the swampy terrain, continued in a southwesterly direction, today's Budapester Stra√üe and Kurf√ºrstendamm.  The Renaissance Ch√¢teau  The terrace = From Castle to Ch√¢teau = The fortified castles, formerly built to secure the sphere of influence according to economic and strategic aspects, which served both as a defensive structure and as an administrative and residential residence, offered hardly any protection due to the further development of small arms and cannons and thus lost more and more of their importance. In addition, the territorial claim to sovereignty of the sovereigns, such as that of the Elector of Brandenburg, whose greatest internal opponent was the landed gentry, had been consolidated. With the aim of avoiding armed conflicts and clarifying claims by legal means, Emperor Maximilian I passed an imperial law at the Imperial Diet of Worms on 7 August 1495 to preserve the Ewiger Landfriede, which, however, was not observed by all nobles. This development led to the transition from castle to palace at the turn of the 15th to 16th centuries. A separation of the different buildings according to their purpose began. In addition to fortifications erected specifically for territorial defence, such as the Spandau Citadel in the Margraviate of Brandenburg, representative palace buildings were built in the establishing European residences as the residence of the princes, in the country mansions of the nobility and castles which were specially designed for hunting. Influenced by the Renaissance castles of Chambord and Blois of the French King Franz I., a lively building activity developed at the European princely courts. The architectural style of the Renaissance, which had its origins in Italy, was mainly applied decoratively in northern Europe, with the building retaining the traditional local house form. With large windows, balconies, bay windows, high dwarf houses, chimneys and paintings, sometimes also staircase towers, the pompous builders let decorate the roofs and facades. With the construction of magnificent castles and representative town houses in the cities, as well as municipal buildings, the wealth and understanding of art could be presented to the public. = The Jagdschloss ‚ÄûZum gr√ºnen Wald‚Äú = For the construction of a hunting lodge in the forest area of the Teltower Heide, today's Grunewald, Elector Joachim II acquired from the noble family of Spi(e)l a plot of land on the south-eastern shore of Lake Spi(e)ls, which later became Lake Grunewald, northeast of the village of Dahlem. He had a moated castle built directly on the water castle, which he called Zum gr√ºnen Wald. Only a ground plan drawn up in the middle of the 17th century, the so-called Renaissance plan, the evaluation of building files found in 1916 and excavations in the 1970s, and a reconstruction drawing of the building published by Albert Geyer in 1936 provide information about the palace grounds.Staatliche Schl√∂sser und G√§rten Berlin (SSGB): 450 Jahre Jagdschlo√ü Grunewald 1542‚Äì1992, I. Aufs√§tze, S. 22. = The Renaissance Plan = The so-called Renaissanceplan The evaluation of the Renaissance plan and the building records of the Kurm√§rkisch Brandenburgischen Amtskammer, then Kurm√§rkische Kriegs- und Dom√§nenkammer, from the years 1669 to 1737, showed that the hunting lodge was originally built as a moated castle on an 8 m √ó 21 m platform and surrounded by a moat and in the northwest by the Grunewaldsee. The only access to the castle was via a wooden bridge spanning the moat. The moat surrounding the building was filled in as early as 1709, and the courtyard was given a completely new appearance after leveling. In addition, in the 19th century the Grunewaldsee lake was lowered several times in order to be able to cut peat on the Dahlemer Wiesen, so that the water level has been around 2.80 meter lower since the castle was built. The originally rectangular building has two almost square tower buildings on the lake side, which the architect Count Rocco Guerrini added after the death of Joachim II in 1571, during the reign of his son John George, Elector of Brandenburg. Around the main building there were some U-shaped outbuildings as well as a wall with a chemin de ronde and a round tower in the middle. The buildings on the southwest side housed a gatehouse and the residence of the castellan, on the north-east side a room for storing hunting gear, a gate room, the entrance gate with an adjoining open arcade and the kitchen. The main house was flanked by elongated buildings that reached as far as the lake. They were opened along the moat by arcades and were used to house hunting dogs, horses and carriages. Although Renaissance architecture largely dispensed with defensive structures, the entire complex and the embrasures in the entrance area still reveal the fortified house. However, the moat, the wall, which was probably equipped with battlements and loopholes, and the later added corner wings, which remind one of fortified towers, were only of aesthetic importance. = Reconstruction of the Renaissance building = Deer relief and sandstone tablet above the entrance portal The building records contained entries of individual repair and reconstruction measures, from which it emerged that some of the decorative Renaissance building elements had been thrown into the moat filled in in 1709 during a reconstruction carried out between 1705 and 1708. After excavations in the 1970s, a reconstruction drawing could be made on the basis of the found components. The evaluation showed that the base area of the castle had not changed, but the outline had. The today uniformly three-storey building originally consisted of a two-storey main house with the three-storey tower- like corner wings facing the lake, an octagonal staircase tower at the front, a so-called staircase tower and another in the connection between the main house and the western corner wing. The protruding entrance building, which still exists on the courtyard-facing front, was adjoined on both sides by a single-storey ancillary building. The windows had round, lead-cased panes. A building component already used in the late Gothic period are the oriels on the bay window towards the lake side, which have also survived. They were missing in almost every building of the 16th century. In addition to their function as a loosening up facade decoration, they also emphasised the importance of the interiors behind them. The main house and the corner wings had gable roofs covered with plain tile, probably inclined by 45‚Äì50 degrees. The octagonal curved bell canopy of the stair towers were covered with slate in \\"Old German covering\\" \\"altdeutscher Deckung\\". Numerous chimneys, dormers and high dormers gave the roof a richly decorated structure. The gables of the house roof, the dormer houses and the entrance building had a half concave, half convex curved outline, the so-called keel arch or donkey's back, a medieval arch form from the late Gothic period, which today only exists in Grunewald at the entrance building. = Owner builder and master builder = Painting Prince Elector Joachim II of Brandenburg by Lucas Cranach the Elder, around 1520. During the reign of Joachim II, Renaissance architecture also found its way into the Margraviate of Brandenburg. He received inspiration for the design of his buildings from his cousin, the Saxon Elector Johann Friedrich I, who had Hartenfels Castle built in Torgau in 1533 by master builder Konrad Krebs. According to his plans and the Torgau model, the Kurm√§rkische Residenzschloss in C√∂lln an der Spree was built in 1538. Caspar Theiss also came to Brandenburg with the Saxon master builder Krebs, who was commissioned with the construction management. Little is known about his origins. However, numerous Renaissance buildings in the Mark are attributed to him, and he is said to have been involved in their planning and management. In the entrance room of the hunting lodge his name can be found on a stone slab above the cellar door. The welcome drink is served on the relief above, the Zecherrelief. According to the inscription the pictures show Caspar Theiss and the building scribe Kunz Buntschuh. There are various details about the third person in the literature. Elector Joachim II, a nobleman or an electoral official and the sculptor Hans Schenk, called Scheutzlich, are suspected. Whether Caspar Theiss was the master builder of Grunewald Castle cannot be clarified by the stone relief, as it is not certain whether it already found its place here in the time when the castle was built. Doubts are cast by the door frame renewed in 1705, which lies under the text plate, and the slightly shifted plate, which does not hang vertically on top of each other, and the relief. There are also no documents that could give any reliable information about the master builder. Due to his degree of popularity and his leading role in numerous building projects under Joachim II, it can be assumed that Theiss also designed the Grunewald hunting lodge architecturally.  The reconstruction under Friedrich I.  Roof of the Jagdmuseum Large courtyard parlour Stove plates of an iron box stove from 1542 = Increase and change of the roof zone = Except for the corner wings, which were attached to the main building under Elector Johann Georg, no major alterations by the successors of Joachim II are known. Due to the building files found, repair work can only be proven again under the Great Elector Friedrich Wilhelm. In 1669 he gave the order \\"to repair the Gr√ºnewald hunting lodge which had been destroyed and had fallen into disrepair and to have it rebuilt\\" The recurring farm maintenance measures continued into the electoral reign of his son Frederick III. Johann Arnold Nering, who during these years was the court architect in the electoral service, died in 1695. His successor Martin Gr√ºnberg was commissioned by Frederick I, the first king to rule Prussia since 1701, to carry out major repair and modernization work, as the \\"K√∂nigl. Jagthaus and nearby located buildings have a major repair highly necessary\\" According to the building records, the inventory was also missing at that time, which suggests that the house was not used during the whole years. In 1705, in addition to interior conversion work, the richly structured roof zone was changed. The saddle roofs of the corner wings and the main house with its dormer houses and dormers gave way to a mansard hipped roof covering these parts of the building with gable dormers on the long sides for lighting the attics. Previously, the main house and the stair tower at the front were extended and adapted to the three-storey corner wings. The protruding entrance building was retained, but the adjoining buildings on both sides were demolished. After the partial installation of new windows and repairs to the outer facades, the conversion was completed in 1708. This external image of the building has been largely preserved to this day. Only the roof view changed in the 1820s, when the gable dormers were replaced by bat dormers during renewed roof repairs. Johann Heinrich Behr, the successor of Martin Gr√ºnberg, who died in 1706, had already taken over the management of the construction work two years earlier. In 1709 he had the moat filled with roof parts and building rubble filled up and planted with grass, paved the courtyard and built three pleasure and fishing cottages by the lake. = The interiors before and after the conversion = The modernisation measures mainly concerned the interiors. Simple stucco ceilings were installed, fireplaces and tiled stoves were built to heat the living rooms, and floors, windows and doors were renewed. An unusual location for the layout of rooms in castles from the time of construction is the large courtyard parlour on the ground floor, as the festival halls were usually located on the upper floor. During the reconstruction, the largest room of the house was divided into two rooms by a partition wall. In the 1970s the hall was able to be restored to its original state and is thus the only room in the palace that conveys the Renaissance style. By demolishing the partition wall, a double arcade with a column, also dividing the room, was uncovered. The stucco ceiling, which was drawn in in 1705, concealed the imitation coffered ceiling, which was divided into fields by black and white ceiling painting. The floor, originally made of red brick slabs, could also be restored. The courtyard room was originally heated by a large box kiln, of which only four cast iron plates have survived. They are the only remains of the interior decoration from the founding period of Grunewald Castle. According to the Renaissance plan, a second, somewhat smaller box kiln was located in a room on the east side of the building. Both were replaced by tiled stoves during the reconstruction in 1705. The narrow, elongated box stoves reaching into the room were flush with the wall on one side and could be heated from a side chamber. These so-called breech loaders were expensive luxury items. They show how much importance Joachim II attached to the hunting lodge, which was certainly representative of its time, especially since the Elector is regarded as one of the greatest promoters of art among the Hohenzollern. There is no reliable information about the use of the two rooms in the corner wings at the time of Joachim II. However, the two rooms and the heatable room on the east side of the house were additionally equipped with toilets, so-called Priveter, and were therefore certainly not without significance. These garderobe, which were attached to the outer wall of the house above the moat and could be reached from the rooms through narrow door openings, were removed during the reconstruction work in 1705. The walled wall surfaces of the formerly 50 centimetre wide door openings reappeared in 1963 when the house was replastered. After the reconstruction in 1708, the Hegemeister was assigned the rooms in the eastern area. The royal chambers included the divided court room and the room in the western corner wing, which Friedrich I used as a bedroom. The most elaborately designed stucco ceiling in the entire palace has oval and polygonal coffered panels and is richly decorated with shells and foliage. The furniture of the 18th century no longer exists. At the time of Joachim II, the private apartments of the electoral couple were on the first floor, which was accessible via the Wendelstein on the front. The elector's living room and bedroom were located in the eastern part of the house, the rooms of the elector in the west. A larger room in the middle, which lay above a part of the court room, probably served as a common dining room. This room and the oriel rooms were also demolished in 1705. The oriels on the corner wings, which are four steps higher than the room floor, have been preserved to this day. Under Frederick I, the rooms on the first floor were used from 1708 to accommodate hunting guests and, according to an inventory from 1710, were partly furnished with bedroom furniture. Before the extension of the building, there was a large attic in the area of the second floor with two rooms in the uppermost part of the three-storey corner wings. The room in the west tower belonged to the private chambers of Elector Johann Georg and could be reached separately from the oriel room below via a small spiral staircase that still exists today. The access doors to the staircase on the first and second floors, with their semicircular endings, date from the Renaissance. A third door from this period is at the entrance to a room in the entrance building, which can be reached from the first floor. In the inventory list the rather modest furnishing of the Grunewald hunting lodge of only nine rooms was listed, although the number of rooms in the three-storey building was much higher. This suggests that the second floor had not yet been furnished. Since only the property of the king was inventoried, the living quarters of the Hegemeister are of course not mentioned either.  The use of the Grunewald hunting lodge = Hunting passion and Anna Sydow (16th century) = Floor plan of the castle around 1790 Joachim II was a passionate hunter who often used his hunting lodges. For his passion for hunting he received several rebukes from his Landst√§nde, which accused him of \\"always lying in the wood and waiting for the hunter\\", however, spending little time on government business. But it was not only the sovereigns who sought diversion in hunting. For the entire court society the hunting events were above all pleasure and pastime. Splendid festivities made them a social event. Hunting lodges were built in the princely territories to accommodate the guests. The hunting lodge Grunewald was in the time of Joachim II not only a place of stay at hunting events lasting several days, but also two decades a permanent residence of his mistress Anna Sydow, popularly known as the beautiful foundrywoman and wife of the head of the electoral foundry in Grimnitz. After her death she was surrounded by the following story, which in popular belief made her the haunted figure of Grunewald Castle. In order to escape the monotony of court life, the second wife of the Elector - Hedwig, daughter of the Polish King Sigismund I - and her entourage took part in the hunting pleasures. During a stay in Grimnitz in 1551, the rotten floor under the electoral couple broke away. Joachim II got stuck between the beams and did not injure himself. The elector, however, plunged into the depths, broke her thigh and impaled herself on the hanging antlers in the room below. After that she could only walk on crutches. He took the physical condition of his wife, which was no longer presentable for Joachim II, as an opportunity to get in touch with Anna Sydow. With her he now showed himself in public and often spent many days in the Grunewald hunting lodge in her company and with her child. After Joachim's death in 1571, Anna Sydow came to Spandau Fortress by order of his son Elector Johann Georg, where she died in 1575. However, the superstition that the unfortunate woman had been walled in alive in the wall of the small spiral staircase in the western corner wing and had been haunting the castle since midnight became firmly established among the people. = Declining interest in the hunting lodge (17th and 18th centuries) = Painting Elector Joachim II of Brandenburg, Lucas Cranach the Younger, around 1570 The Grunewald hunting lodge was neglected for many decades and was therefore not or hardly used by the Brandenburg electors. Due to the repairs carried out under the Great Elector Friedrich Wilhelm, the building could be used again, but he had a new hunting lodge built only a few kilometer southwest of Grunewald, near his residence Potsdam 1683 with Klein-Glienicke. The Grunewald hunting lodge also played only a minor role for his son Frederick I. Nevertheless, the continuous reports of damage led to the order for modernisation measures. The outbuildings also underwent a change. The stable building on the west side of the main house, originally open to the former moat, was replaced by a two- storey building. On the ground floor there was space for the accommodation of the carriages, on the upper floor the castellan received an apartment. A half- timbered stable was attached to it towards the lake. In the north-east the arcade between the entrance gate and the kitchen was bricked up and new stables were built in front of the wall in the south-east. Like many of his predecessors, the soldier king Frederick William I was a passionate hunter. He often hunted in the Grunewald, but never used the castle for longer stays. For his excessive hunting he favoured the forest area around K√∂nigs Wusterhausen, whose dominion and castle he was given by his father Friedrich I at the age of ten, as well as a farmer's heath southeast of his residence Potsdam, which he had developed between 1725 and 1729 for the organisation of par force hunts - the so-called par force heath since then. The Stern hunting lodge was built in 1730 in the centre of the complex. As early as 1734, renewed damage to the roof of the main house in Grunewald and dilapidated fishing cottages were reported. Since 1734 the term \\"castle\\" has been used in the documents. With Frederick the Great's accession to power in 1740, the hunting lodge finally lost its importance. In contrast to his ancestors - the exception being Johann Sigismund - he rejected hunting as a pastime. In the book Anti-Machiavel, in which he wrote down his thoughts about the tasks and goals of the exercise of princely power during the Crown Prince's reign, he described them as one of the sensual pleasures that move the body very much and do not improve the mind. On June 22, 1765, Frederick the Great gave the order to store the hunting equipment of the Berlin hunting yard at the Friedrichswerder in an annex to the Grunewald hunting lodge. In order to be able to take up the Berlin inventory, a stable in the south of the court had to be enlarged on both sides, \\"from 207 feet\\" (about 65 meters) to a \\"total length of 535 feet\\" (about 168 meters). In the new hunting equipment magazine the equipment required for the various types of hunting found room, but not the weapons, which were accommodated in armory and armory. Like Frederick the Great, his nephew and successor Frederick William II was not interested in hunting. For occasional stays he had three rooms on the first floor of the hunting lodge furnished. In 1788 Johann Friedrich Nagel commissioned him to create a painting with a view of the castle from the northeast and only one remaining fishing cottage at Grunewaldsee, which was also demolished around 1903. It is the oldest pictorial document of the hunting lodge. = Revival and Hubertus hunting (19th century) = Frederick William III by Ernst Gebauer 1826 Frederick William III, on the Prussian throne since 1797, also used the hunting lodge only for occasional stays. He also found no pleasure in hunting. During his reign in May 1814, Grunewald briefly became an attraction for the Berlin population. During the Napoleonic Wars, the French emperor had the Quadriga of the Brandenburg Gate brought to Paris as booty in December 1806. After the Battle of Paris at the end of March 1814 and Napoleon's defeat, it was brought back to Prussia. Packed in boxes, the work of the sculptor Johann Gottfried Schadows stood in Grunewald for a few days before being transported on to Berlin. The building records of the Royal Court Marshal's Office also contain records of various repair works, which accumulated in the 1820s and led to a new roofing of the main house, whereby the dormers from the 1705 reconstruction were removed and replaced by five bat dormers. In the 1820s, interest in the Grunewald hunting grounds grew again. Through the sons of Friedrich Wilhelm III, the princes Friedrich Wilhelm, Wilhelm and above all at the instigation of Carl, the par force hunt, also known as the Red Hunt, was revived on 8 February 1828. Until the abandonment of the hunting ground at the beginning of the following century, hunting events took place regularly. The annual Hubertus hunt on 3 November was of particular importance. State guests took part in it, such as the Russian Tsar Alexander II from the house of Romanov in 1864. In Grunewald the thousandth par force hunt could already be celebrated in 1863 under Wilhelm I, who had ruled since 1861. Of the 2000 par force hunts held by the court in the various hunting grounds around Berlin between 1828 and 1897, 638 were carried out in the Grunewald alone. The hunting lodge had meanwhile been equipped with all kinds of furniture and utensils again. In 1891 there was a vomit affair. One of the biggest sex scandals in the German Empire under Emperor Wilhelm II took place in January 1891 in the hunting lodge, when 15 ladies and gentlemen of the aristocratic court society celebrated an orgy there and this became known nationwide. = Museum use of the hunting lodge (20th century until today) = Courtyard of the hunting lodge 2018 Diana by Wilhelm Cristian Meyer 1769 KPM Landgraf Friedrich by Matth√§us Merian the Younger Already in the middle of the 19th century the Berliners discovered the Grunewald and the Seenkette - the Hundekehle-, Grunewald- and Schlachtensee as well as Krumme Lanke - as local recreation areas. In addition, the forest area of the hunting grounds became increasingly smaller due to the growth of the city of Berlin, military facilities, railway lines and roads, so that some par force hunts were held as early as the end of the 19th century in the Par force heath and the hunting lodge Stern. In 1907 the Grunewald was finally abandoned as a hunting ground. The permanent forest contract of 1915 between the Zweckverband Gro√ü-Berlin and the Prussian Forest Administration finally designated large parts of the Grunewald as local recreation areas. Despite the developments, the last German Emperor Wilhelm II had some contemporary modernisation measures carried out in the castle between 1901 and 1908. In addition to roof repairs, details of the renovation are no longer traceable, but toilets and bathrooms were brought to the upper floor and the demolition of some tiled stoves led to the discovery of the four remaining cast iron plates of the box stoves from the Renaissance. After the First World War and the end of the monarchy, the assets, land and real estate of the House of Hohenzollern were confiscated by the new government. After the passing of the \\"Act on the Dispute of Property between the Prussian State and the Members of the Formerly Governing Prussian Royal House\\" on 26 October 1926, the Grunewald Hunting Lodge came into the possession of the Prussian State and then into the care of the Prussian Administration of State Castles and Gardens, founded in 1927. In 1932, they set up a museum in the building with furniture from the 17th to 19th centuries and paintings of German and Dutch painting from the 16th and 17th centuries. In addition to 29 existing paintings with hunting motifs, 153 paintings from the holdings of various Hohenzollern castles were added.  The collection of paintings  During the Second World War, the hunting lodge survived the heavy bombardments of Berlin unscathed. However, fighting in the last days of the war damaged some works of art and seventeen paintings were missing after looting by members of the Soviet occupying power. With the permission of the American headquarters, the museum was reopened on 16 May 1949, and after the war it became the first Berlin art museum to be open to the public again. The collection in Grunewald Castle was further expanded by the removal of works of art from the destroyed Berlin Palace and Monbijou Palace. In addition, there were the three-winged altarpiece of the early 15th century, from the town church in Cadolzburg demolished in 1750, some paintings by Lucas Cranach the Elder, such as Judith with the Head of the Holofernes and the portrait of 65-year-old Joachim II by Lucas Cranach the Younger. Some pictures from the booty were also returned, such as a presumably old copy of the Fall of Man by Jan Gossaert and the Lucretia by Lucas Cranach the Elder, both from the 16th century and the small painting Smoking Women by the Leiden painter Jan Steen from the 17th century. The painting Lady with Parrot by the Leiden painter Willem van Mieris, which has also been recovered, has been kept in the Cabinet at Caputh Castle since 2004. After many years of renovation work, Berlin's largest Cranach collection has been on display here since 2011. These include nine large-format central panels from a Passion cycle of 1537/38 from the collegiate church of the former Dominican monastery in C√∂lln. The collection also includes four large-format copy plates with the Sovereign virtues of courage, moderation, justice and wisdom, which were probably created in 1540/1545 for a room in the Stechbahnfl√ºgel of C√∂llner Castle. German and Dutch paintings from the 15th and 16th centuries are also on display, most of which the Prussian royal house acquired at the beginning of the 19th century from the collection of the English merchant Edward Solly. The permanent exhibition also includes portraits of Brandenburg-Prussian rulers and members of their families, paintings and equipment with hunting motifs as well as various types of presentation of hunting trophies.  The Hunting Museum  A hunting museum was opened on 29 January 1977 in the former hunting goods magazine of Frederick the Great, which after reconstruction had a hall length of 38 meter. The original equipment no longer existed, so that mainly handguns such as arquebus and pistols from the second third of the 16th to the 18th century were exhibited. Of these, about one hundred wheel lock weapons come from the inventory of the former Berlin armoury and a large part from the collection of Prince Carl of Prussia. The museum also features trophies of deer, fallow deer and elk as well as roe buck horns, which were previously in the hunting lodge.  The castle as a film backdrop  As early as 1967, the castle served as the backdrop for shots for the Edgar Wallace film adaptation Creature with the Blue Hand, with Klaus Kinski in a double role, later as the location for the film Wild Geese II, and from 1997 to 2007 as the external backdrop for the children's series Schloss Einstein of the KiKa. Outdoor shots for the series Verliebt in Berlin also took place there.

The earliest written testimony about its existence is in a register from 1506, where it is listed among the pious foundations of Gazi √ñmer Bey., at p. 311 It is an orthogonal building, whose southern, eastern, and western sides are decorated with monumental pointed arches. Its dimensions are 27 √ó 18 m. The entrance was through a low gate on the northern side, leading to a small room, probably used as a treasury. This room was topped by six lead-covered domes, supported by two massive pillars. Nineteen shops were located in vaulted rooms located around the central courtyard, mostly dealing in cloth and valuables. Until its destruction by fire in 1799 it served as the city's commercial heart, along with the adjacent open-air market and bazaar. the 17th-century traveller Evliya Celebi mentions the building, describing it as a \\"veritable fortress\\" and likening it to a citadel. Indeed, the Frourio (\\"Fortress\\") hill received its name from the bedesten. In the 19th century it was used as a gunpowder magazine.

Modernism is often contrasted with traditionalism, which upholds ulama-based and syncretic vernacular traditions. Modernism is inspired by reformism in the late-19th to early 20th century based in the Middle East, such as Islamic modernism and Wahhabism. Throughout the history of contemporary Muslim Indonesia, modernism has spawned various religious organizations, from mass organization Muhammadiyah (1912), political party Masyumi Party (1943), to missionary organization Indonesian Islamic Dawah Council (1967). Usage of the term The division between \\"traditionalism\\" and \\"modernism\\" is widely used by both Indonesians and foreign academics to describe the chasm which has been existed among the contemporary Muslim society in Indonesia.Bush, 2009. Previously, Muslim society in Java in particular was analyzed through the division of abangan, santri and priyayi popularized by an anthropologist Clifford Geertz based on communal identity. However, this division has already been considered obsolete.Von Der Mehden, 1995. Geertz's category of santri is considered referring to modernist Islam.Geertz, 1960. Greg Barton of Monash University states that since the 1950s and 1960s, Indonesian society could be reasonably described based on the traditionalist-modernist dualism.Barton, 1994. Definition Modernism is defined by its pure adherence toward the Qur'an and Hadith, promotion of ijtihad (individual reasoning), rejection of maddhab (Islamic schools of jurisprudence) and the authority held by ulama (Muslim intellectual on religious issues), as well as criticism against taqlid (imitation of judicial precedence), Sufism, and vernacular traditions based on syncretism with local practices. Modernism is also often discussed in terms of its internal conflict between the tendency inspired by the Enlightenment philosophy, science and rationality, championed by Muhammad Abduh, and the one oriented toward scriptural literalism and unified regulation of formal ritual behavior promoted by Rashid Rida. The latter is considered closer to Salafism.Feener, 2007. According to Robin Bush of RTI International, modernism initially encouraged ijtihad in order to widen the freedom of individual interpretation, but the rejection of religious sources outside of the scripture has led to the development of a rigid and legalistic tendency. =Neo-modernism= Since the 1980s and 1990s, attempts to bridge the gap between traditionalism and modernism were made, and progressive intellectuals of both sides have attained interpretational resemblance with common goals of pluralism and interfaith tolerance. These movements are called \\"neo-modernism\\" by scholars such as Fachry Ali, Bahtiar Effendy and Greg Barton.Ali and Effendy, 1986.Barton, 1995. Neo-modernism was heavily inspired by the Pakistani Muslim intellectual Fazlur Rahman, and popularized by an intellectual stream called pembaruan (renewal). The most important neo- modernist or pembaruan thinkers including Nurcholish Madjid, Djohan Effendi and Luthfi Assyaukanie. They have cooperated with the reform-minded traditionalists such as Abdurrahman Wahid of Nahdlatul Ulama, holding strong influence during the late 1990s to early 2000s.Hefner, 2000. History Islam in Indonesia was spread by Arab traders and Sufi saints after the 16th century. It had legitimated the authority of the ulama and taqlid as a learning system, and prompted incorporation of vernacular Hindu or animist practices into the Islamic tradition. Since the 18th century, the Islamic world was facing European colonization worldwide and philosophical crisis. Islamic modernism was articulated by philosophers such as Jamal ad-din Al Afghani, Muhammad Abduh and Rashid Rida to revive the Islamic civilization. They criticized the ulama's authority and taqlid as blind imitation, as well as Sufism for deviation and blamed them for the demise of Islamic teaching and civilization. With the increase of Indonesian students studying the Middle East, Indonesian Muslim such as Abdullah Ahmad, Ahmad Dahlan, Ahmad Hassan, and Moenawar Chalil had brought Islamic modernism into the Indonesian archipelago. In West Sumatra, a reformist youth group Kaum Muda held strong influence. Ahmad founded an Islamic magazine Al-Munir in Padang, inspired by Al-Manar published by Rida. In 1912, Dahlan established a socio-religious organization Muhammadiyah, the first religious mass organization in Indonesia. Hassan and Chalil both became prominent members of a modernist organization PERSIS, established in 1923. Other modernist organizations including Al-Irshad Al-Islamiya in Jakarta (1914) and Sumatera Thawalib in West Sumatra (1915). Modernists were also active on the political arena, establishing Union of Indonesian Muslims (PERMI) in 1930, Masyumi Party in 1943, and Muslim Students' Association (HMI) in 1947. The leader of the Masyumi Party, Mohammad Natsir, became the most prominent proponent of modernism throughout the Sukarno and New Order era. Through Masyumi Party, Natsir campaigned for implementing sharia on the state level. Following the banning by the Suharto regime, Natsir went underground and founded Indonesian Islamic Dawah Council (DDII) in 1967. DDII built strong relations with the Middle Eastern Muslim scholars of Salafi and Wahhabi brands and played a huge role in importing these doctrines to Indonesia. During the New Order era, HMI built strong relations with the ruling Golkar Party, inducing the changes of Suharto's policy toward Muslims. During the 1980s and 1990s, the progressive branch of neo-modernism had gained a strong presence thanks to Nurcholish Madjid and his Paramadina University. Madjid and other modernists were active in the political organization Indonesian Association of Muslim Intellectuals (ICMI). ICMI became the main vehicle for the Suharto regime's attempt to obtain Muslim support. However, Madjid later broke off with ICMI for its compromise toward the Suharto regime. Neo-modernists and Madjid had played a major role, along with progressive traditionalists such as Abdurrahman Wahid after the fall of Suharto and the democratic transition in the reformation era. After the reformation, modernists of Muhammadiyah established National Mandate Party (PAN) with Amien Rais as the chairman. Puritan branch of modernists has been absorbed to Jemaah Tarbiyah which founded Prosperous Justice Party (PKS).Machmudi, 2008. Neo-modernists influenced the creation of Liberal Islam Network (JIL) and the progressive Muhammadiyah Berkemajuan movement.Burhani, 2016. NotesFootnotesReferences *Ali, F. and Effendy, B. (1986).

It was built from 1912 to 1916. It is also known as New Metcalfe Bond Stores. The property is owned by Property NSW, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002.  History  The building stands upon the site of the former garden and orchard for Robert Campbell's Wharf House (1800-1883),Johnson & SHFA, 2000 itself on a grant made to Campbell on 29 June 1814.Architectural Projects, 2005 Part of it was later used as a quarry. The existing stone retaining wall at George Street probably dates from the mid to late 19th century. For much of the 19th century the site was apparently used as Campbell's garden and was acquired by the Colonial Government in 1887 and then used as a stone quarry. In 1900 the site was vested in the NSW Government as part of the Darling Harbour Resumptions, following the outbreak of bubonic plague.SCRA, 1972: CC/05 In 1912, a three-storey warehouse used by Upward & Co., Bonded and Free Stores was resumed and demolished to allow the formation of Hickson Road. The company required new storage space to replace the demolished building. Upward & Co. was founded by John Upward (1854-1918) born in London, who arrived in NSW in 1862. After time in Queensland, he returned to NSW in 1874 and found employment with the Australasian Steam Navigation Company (ASN). He returned to Qld. as manager of ASN's Cairns branch, returning to NSW again to take charge of its bonded stores. Upward approached ASN in 1880 and as a result took over its interests in the bond and ran it as his \\"private concern\\", Upward & Co. In August 1912 John Upward signed a 50-year lease on a parcel of land with a frontage of 81m on the eastern side of George Street. One condition of the lease was that \\"a building to the value of at least 10,000 pounds was erected thereon\\".TKD, 2015 The land on which this building now stands was leased from the Government for 50 years. The Metcalfe Bond Stores was built in two sections, the northern section in 1912 and the southern section in 1916. On his death in 1918 the company was managed by his son, Leonard. At the conclusion of the 50-year lease period, Upward & Co. continued to occupy the building as tenants until 1972 - some seven years. Once the company had vacated the building, the building reverted to Government ownership, but Upward & Co. stayed on as tenants. On 12 January 1970 ownership of the building passed to the Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority (SCRA). In 1972 the Authority commenced work on the staged conversion of the store to offices, galleries, shops and restaurants. Plans for these works were carried out by architects Devine, Erby Mazlin, who also renovated Campbell's Stores at West Circular Quay, for the SCRA. Amongst various modifications was a fitout for the Pancakes at the Rocks restaurant and for W Kennedy's Old Spaghetti Factory restaurant. Works associated with the fitout were situated on part of the lower ground floor, ground and first floors. A kitchen with large cool room and store were installed at the southern end of the ground floor, a new stair linking thsese with the restaurant above. New floors were introduced over existing flooring on the restaurant level and the floor was strengthened to support a feature tram car. Storage was situated in the lower ground floor. The Old Spaghetti Factory moved into the building in early 1973. It seems to have been an instant success and was even visited by international celebrities (for instance the \\"Rolling Stones\\" English band were photographed in the tram in the restaurant in 1973). By the second half of 1988 the establishment was being touted as a venue for \\"family fun\\". Further change to the building occurred in 1984. An arcade of part of the ground floor was documented early that year, and extended along the entire level to include a link to 86 George Street, necessitating a reduction in size of staff amenities area associated with the Old Spaghetti Factory, which occurred in 1984 or 1985. The restaurant kitchen was modified around the end of 1986 with a relocated cool room. In 2011 Sydney Harbour Foreshore Authority undertook extensive base works, including upgrading amenities, lifts, stairwells, toilets and building services. The site formed part of Robert Campbell's garden from -1870s. By the end of this period there is some evidence that stone was being quarried. A rough faced ashlar retaining wall is visible in the basement of the building along the George St frontage which may date to 1880s or earlier. Current Bond Store building constructed . In 1970 the Sydney Cove Authority occupied part of the building.  Description  The three-storey view from George Street, , pictured in 2019. The Metcalfe Bond comprises two adjacent buildings, both simple bond stores in the functionalist tradition with timber post and beam interior construction. Exterior walls are of load bearing red brick with minimal darker brick outlines. 66-76 George Street: The older of the two buildings, built in 1912, comprises three storeys to George Street and five to Hickson Road, seven bays long with a stucco parapet. Openings on ground and second floors are semi-circular in shape. 78-84 George Street: Located south of the earlier building and built in 1916, also of three storeys to George Street, five to Hickson Road but nine bays long. The parapet is stepped, dividing the fa√ßade into three large sections. All openings are rectangular with two prominent string courses between the first and second floors. The brick detailing is more elaborate than the 1912 store, but the two form a harmonious whole of uniform height and texture.Croker, 1976 Style: Federation Warehouse; Storeys: five; Roof cladding: corrugated iron; Floor frame: timber. = Condition = As at 3 May 2001, Archaeology Assessment Condition: Destroyed Assessment Basis: Site redeveloped in 1994.

Early life  Petra Vela was born on 31 January 1823, to Gregorio and Josefa Vela in Mier, Mexico. Her father was a Spanish governor who oversaw the territory between the Rio Grande and Nueces Rivers. Being one of seventeen children, she grew up in a very religious and patriotic household.  Career and marriages  Petra‚Äôs first marriage was to Luis Vidal, a Greek colonel in the Mexican Regular Army, the exact date of which is unknown. Luis‚Äô decorated military career allowed him and Petra to become a very wealthy family and allowed Petra to establish military contacts within the Mexican military. Luis Vidal died in 1849 of cholera whereupon Petra inherited much of Luis‚Äô wealth. This added to the wealth she had inherited from her father‚Äôs estate in 1846, making Petra a very wealthy woman for this time. Following her first husband‚Äôs death, Petra decided to take her children and move to Brownsville, Texas. There she met Mifflin Kenedy, a rancher, and the two were married in 1852. Over the next several years, Petra and Mifflin had six more children and adopt another child. In 1854, Petra and Mifflin purchased 10,000 sheep and would grow their influence over the next several years. With frontier raids becoming common place. The Kenedys became one of the wealthiest families in South Texas, dealing primarily in cattle, horses, sheep and land. Mifflin Kenedy was partners with Richard King in the King Ranch until 1868. The following year, he purchased the Laureles Ranch near Corpus Christi, and the family moved there. The ranch consisted of 172,000 acres and employed 161 people. Petra Kenedy managed the servants. Petra was able to use her connections to persuade raiders not to raid her ranch and she used her wealth to fund a small army of mercenaries to protect her interest.

She was one of the first four women to be elected to the Folketing (the Danish national parliament) in 1918. Biography Born on 2 December 1885 in Copenhagen, Mathilde Johanne Malling was the daughter of the high court lawyer Gustav Frederik Ludvig Vilhelm Schneider Malling (1855‚Äì1919) and Hortensia Martine Malmberg (1860‚Äì1946). Raised in a well-to-do environment, she matriculated from Laura Engelhardt's School in 1950, studied law at the University of Copenhagen and graduated as Cand.jur. in 1911. She immediately entered her father's legal firm, becoming a high court barrister and her father's partner in 1914. In 1915 she married the high court lawyer Rudolph Hauschultz (1884‚Äì1958) with whom she took over her father's business on his death in 1919. Following in the footsteps of Henny Magnussen, she became a well- established barrister. On the political front, she was an active supporter of improvements to national defence, joining the Danish Women's Defence Association (Danske Kvinders Forsvarsforening) in 1907. In 1914, she co- founded the Danish Women's Conservative Association (Danske Kvinders konservative Forening), the first party-political women's organisation. By 1918, she had become widely known for her influence on the agenda of the Conservative People's Party where she also stood in favour of women's inclusion in the 1918 elections. It was therefore no surprise that not only she, but her colleague Karen Ankersted were both elected to the Folketing as representatives of the Conservative People's Party. Two other women were also elected: Helga Larsen for the Social Democrats and Elna Munch for the Social Liberals. After Ankersted died in 1921, she was the only conservative women in the Rigsdag. She fought for better legal conditions for housewives and children while continuing to call for improvements to defence. She was a frequent contributor to magazines and newspaper, editing the Berlingske Tidende column on Kvinden og Hjemmet (Women and the Home). Apparently as a result of over-exertion, she died from a stroke on 30 December 1929, only 44 years old. She is buried in Copenhagen's Assistens Cemetery.

They apply within the national territory and territorial waters of a country. In most cases they apply to occupational diving, but in a few cases also to recreational diving. There are exemptions for recreational diving in some cases where it is recognised as a self- regulated industry. Offshore diving (outside of territorial waters) is generally outside the scope of diving regulations, and tends to be self- regulated through voluntary membership of industry organisations. Scope The scope of diving regulations is generally defined in each specific set of regulations and the statutory law which empowers them, which can vary considerably across jurisdictions. Diving regulations apply within the national territorial waters of the country. Alternatives Diving regulations apply within the national territorial waters of the country. In general they do not apply in international waters, but the commercial diving industry operates in international waters, in what is generally known as the offshore diving industry. In these waters the industry is largely self- regulated through voluntary membership of organisations such as the International Marine Contractors Association (IMCA). Members of these organisations are required as a condition of membership to comply with their Codes of Practice. In some jurisdictions specific exemptions and exceptions may be stipulated. For example: *In the US, the American Academy of Underwater Sciences (AAUS) is responsible for the promulgation of the AAUS Standards for Scientific Diving Certification and Operation of Scientific Diving Programs.

The Ogunquit Museum of American Art in Maine has over 120 of his watercolors representing all aspects of his work. His paintings are in the collections of many museums in the USA and have been the subject of exhibitions throughout the United States. He was an influential educator through his nearly 40 years of teaching, writing, and film making.  Life  Eliot O'Hara was born in 1890, in Waltham, Massachusetts to Daniel and Mayfred O'Hara.\\"Massachusetts, Town Clerk, Vital and Town Records, 1626‚Äì2001,\\" database with images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:F4KX-JLB : 17 October 2017), Elliot O'Hara, 14 Jun 1890; citing Birth, Waltham, Middlesex, Massachusetts, United States, , town clerk offices, Massachusetts; FHL microfilm 2,110,841. His father was the owner of the O'Hara Waltham Dial Company and Eliot went into the family business. In 1923 he began teaching himself to paint with watercolors while continuing to work at the family factory.EX-FACTORY HAND WINS PRIZE FOR A PAINTING. (1931, Jul 29). New York Times In 1927, O'Hara took a few courses at the Boston Museum School and at the School of Fine arts and Crafts in Boston and then, in 1928, he was awarded a Guggenheim fellowship in painting. Moscow Church, 1929 In 1929 O'Hara undertook an epic journey through Soviet Russia. Traveling by train, horseback and foot, he produced 130 sketches and watercolors that he later completed at a studio in Paris. The paintings were exhibited in the Soviet Union and at galleries in London, Boston, and New York.CHERRY RUSSIA. (April 20, 1930). New York Times A selection of the paintings toured throughout the United States. He remained an avid traveler and plein air painter throughout his life, locations for his paintings include Peru, Australia, Japan, China, Indonesia, and Thailand. In 1931, he opened the Eliot O'Hara School for Watercolor Painting in Goose Rocks Beach, Maine. The school was active until it burned down in the Great Fires of 1947. After the fire, O'Hara continued to offer classroom instruction at summer workshops around the United States. O'Hara authored his first book of watercolor instruction in 1931, his final book was published in 1966. During World War II, from 1943‚Äì44, he served in the Camouflage Section, Bureau of Ships, U.S. Navy. In the late 1940s O'Hara began making art education films for Encyclopaedia Britannica Films, his last film was made in 1961. In 1948 O'Hara was among the first water-colorists inducted into the National Academy of Design. O'Hara died in Washington D.C. in 1969 from cancer of the kidney.Eliot O'hara, a water-colorist and school founder, 79, dies. (1969, Aug 02). New York Times  Art  Beginning with his first exhibitions, O'Hara was noted for his technical skill in watercolor. He preserved and advanced his mastery of the medium throughout his life, achieving a \\"miraculous\\" level of skill. For O'Hara, mastery was not an end but a means to achieve expression of his artistic voice. He wrote that \\"the problems of techniques and materials are of relatively minor importance\\" and that the goal is to use technique to achieve \\"the greatest possible emotional thrust.\\" Marathon Key, 1968 O'Hara mainly painted outdoors, finding in nature a reliable source of inspiration. His later landscapes became less complex tending towards simple washes with spare, obvious brushstrokes. These later restrained and abstracted landscapes, of surprising simplicity, evoke a calm, profound power that \\"stand with the finest of American watercolors\\". O'Hara worked primarily with transparent watercolors but he was open to other media. He taught himself several printmaking techniques, made collages, experimented with acrylics, and sometimes painted with gouache and casein.  Teaching  O'Hara taught watercolor painting at his school in Maine and at classes sponsored by universities, museums and art associations around the United States. O'Hara said that his teaching was \\"predicated on the assumption that art itself cannot be taught\\", therefore his teaching focused on the development of technical skills as a means to self expression. His student, Carl Schmalz, attempted to capture the organization and content of his classroom teaching in the book \\"Water Color Lessons from Eliot O'Hara\\". In addition to his classroom teaching, O'Hara wrote books on watercolor painting and made art education films. His notable students include Carl Schmalz, George Campbell Tinning, Elsie Lower Pomeroy, and Standish Backus.

Background In the early 1830s Schumann worked on sketches for an opera based on Shakespeare's Hamlet. Although that project did not come to fruition, Schumann used the sketches and other fresh material to compose the first two movements of a symphony in G minor and sketches for two further movements before abandoning work on the symphony as well.John Daverio: \\"Robert Schumann: Orchestral Works, A Quest for Mastery of the Grand Form\\", 1997 The nickname \\"Zwickau\\" comes from Schumann's home town where the first movement of the symphony was given a performance at the Gewandhaus on November 18, 1832, a concert at which Schumann's future wife, the then thirteen-year-old Clara Wieck, performed on piano and had one of her own orchestral compositions performed (the Scherzo for Orchestra - now lost). Structure and style The symphony is scored for a traditional orchestra of the period: 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 2 horns, 2 trumpets, 3 trombones, timpani and strings. The completed movements are as follows: A typical performance lasts approximately 18‚Äì19 minutes. In the months leading up to working on this symphony Schumann had been studying and transcribing the music of Beethoven, whose influence can be heard in the first two movements, particularly the use of short motives rather than full-blown melodies in the first movement and the solemn rhythms of the second, which are reminiscent of the slow movement of Beethoven's Symphony No. 7.

It was built for William Samson in 1844. It is also known as Samson's Cottage (wall remains) and Puppet Cottage (Samsons). The property is owned by Property NSW, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002.  History  In 1790 this parcel of land was part of the proposed 2nd stage of Sydney Hospital. William Balmain was granted a lease which included this lot, and by 1807 he had released the property to the Government. By March 1837 William Carr and George John Rogers were trustees of the property and in October 1838 Sir George Gipps granted the land to Carr and Rogers. In February 1839 Frederic Wright Unwin became the owner of the property and on 21 June 1843 conveyed lot 7 of the subdivision of Lots 1 & 2 of Section 85 to William Samson, a stevedore. Samson completed the erection of a two-storey house to the rear of the lot in 1844. The three roomed house was constructed of stone and brick walls and the roof was clad in shingles. In 1853 Samson erected a single storey shop containing three rooms to George Street frontage. The shop walls were constructed out of \\"Wood and Brick\\" and the roof was shingled. The Cottage of William and Martha Samson was considered \\"large\\" by the rating assessors in 1858. In 1882 Martha Samson sold Lot 7 to William Cope and Cunningham Archibald Atchison and in the same year they conveyed the Cottage and shop to Alexander William Cormack. In 1882-83 the shop on George Street was pulled down and during 1883 Cormack erected a three-storey building containing two shops to George Street and lodging rooms over. The walls were constructed in brick and the roof clad with iron. The premises was divided into two tenements, each with nine rooms and were numbered 75 and 75.5. The southern wall of Samson's cottage formed part of the wall to Joseph Raphael's store and stable constructed 1853. The remaining walls are a very good indication of the house's former size and materials used.SCRA 1979: KL/07 In 1991-92 a new infill building was constructed on the site of Samsons Cottage incorporating the remaining sections of the former house. The form of the new building is similar to that of the original cottage, built in 1844 and demolished in the 1920s. The small mezzanine area was located to give visitors an unimpeded view of the south wall of the original cottage contained within the new building. Archaeological work before construction revealed foundations and valuable historical information. The building, designed as a multi purpose space, is currently being used as The Rocks Discovery Museum.SCRA, Annual Report, 1992: 29  Description  The original two storey cottage had stone and brick walls and a shingle roof and was pulled down in 1883, however parts of the northern, western and southern walls of the building still remain. The southern wall of Samson's cottage formed part of the wall to Joseph Raphael's store and stable, constructed in 1853. The cottage has been rebuilt in 1991-2 in its original form.

A small terrace was constructed at the rear, overlooking the courtyard system, which was extensively repaved and landscaped. The toilet block was upgraded to provide public toilets. *2005: Conservation and adaptive reuse of the building for the Rocks Discovery Museum involved cutting a doorway in the upper wall and building overhead walkway to enable disabled access to the 2nd floor of the museum.

Heritage listing  As at 31 March 2011, Samson's Cottage (wall remains) and site are of State heritage significance for their historical and scientific cultural values. The site and building are also of State heritage significance for their contribution to The Rocks area which is of State Heritage significance in its own right. The remaining walls portray extremely well the development of the site and adjoining property in a rare visual cut away section. The scale, form, colour, texture, and material of the fabric are all conveyed very well. Illustrative of the changing development and growth of the residential and commercial, and industrial precinct of The Rocks and Sydney, it contributes greatly to the streetscape and rear courtyards.Tropman, 1989: 40 The rear courtyard portrays the early subdivision pattern of the 1840s by Unwin. It is an example of mixed usage with an early residence in a commercial and later industrial precinct with the construction of the Kendall Factory. The remaining walls clearly indicate the scale and fabric of this \\"large\\" two storey 1844 residence of William Samson. The height of the building, the steep pitch of the gable roof and type of materials used, are all evident from the remaining fabric. The southern wall of the residence which has been built into the Coach house is significant in illustrating the position of the fireplace, and its later extension with the construction of the Coach house. The stone wall to Kendall Lane and the distinct remaining impression of the south wall contributes the existing streetscape to the Lane. The remains of the cottage effectively illustrates the early practice of building common or party walls. In particular the incorporation of the southern and northern wall of Samson's cottage into the Coach house and Ambulance station.

The Japanese tunnel is a protection tunnel built by the Japanese occupying army around 1942 for defense purposes, which was fully completed in June, 1944. It was first discovered in the early 1950s and opened to the tourists in 1994. As is known, during World War II in 1942 Japanese occupied force had begun to be pressured by Allied forces, and started to construct many hiding tunnels across the archipelago of then Dutch East Indies , not only in Bukittinggi, but also in cities of Bandung and Biak, as well as other places in Indonesia. History Interior of Lobang Jepang The tunnel was made by the instructions of Lieutenant General Moritake Tanabe, Commander in Chief of the 25th Army of the Japanese Army. The purpose of building this tunnel was to use as a place for storing supplies and equipment for Japanese army warfare. this tunnel, including the reconnaissance room, ambush room, prison, and arsenal. In addition to its strategic location in a city that was once the center of Sumatra's government, the land that became the wall of this tunnel is a type of land which if mixed with water will be more robust. Even the earthquake that shook West Sumatra in 2009 did not damage the structure of the tunnel much. It is estimated that tens of thousands of forced labor or romusha were mobilized from the islands of Java, Sulawesi and Kalimantan to dig this tunnel. The selection of labor from outside this area is a Japanese colonial strategy to maintain the secrecy of this mega project. Workers from Bukittinggi themselves were deployed including working on defense tunnels in Bandung and Biak Island. Thousands of labor died to build this tunnel. Attractions Entrance of Lobang Jepang Japanese tunnel began to be managed as historical attractions in 1984, by the city government of Bukittinggi. Some of the entrances to this Japanese tunnel are located in the Sianok Gorge area, Panorama Park, next to the Bung Hatta Palace and at the Bukittinggi Zoo.Terowongan Jepang Only 1.5 kilometers of this tunnel is accessible for tourists, which is touted as the longest tunnel in Asia with a total length of up to 8 km. The winding tunnel had a width of about 2 meters, with a depth of 49 meters below ground. There are 21 small aisles whose functions vary, ranging from ammunition rooms, meeting rooms, escape doors, ambush rooms, kitchen room and prisons. Apparently the kitchen room wasn't used not only for cooking, but also used to chop dead prisoners and dump them through the water hole down. In this place there are 2 small holes, one above for reconnaissance, and one more hole below which was then used to dispose of the bodies of forced workers and prisoners of war who died due to cruel torture of Japanese soldiers. On the four sides of the kitchen wall there are strokes. In the kitchen there is a concrete table which was allegedly used to execute prisoners. When the tunnel was not opened to the public, there were skulls and tools to build like hoes, which are now kept in museum.

It was built for William Cormack and built from 1883, and over the years, it has housed a Chinese laundry, an art gallery and an antique shop. It is located at 75-75.5 George Street in the inner city suburb of The Rocks in the City of Sydney local government area. The property is owned by Property NSW, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002.  History  In 1790 this parcel of land was part of the proposed second stage of Sydney Hospital. William Balmain was granted a lease which included this lot, and by 1807 he had released the property to the Government. By March 1837 William Carr and George John Rogers were trustees of the property and in October 1838 Sir George Gipps granted the land to Carr and Rogers. In February 1839 Frederic Wright Unwin became the owner of the property and on 21 June 1843 conveyed lot 7 of the subdivision of Lots 1 & 2 of Section 85 to William Samson, a stevedore. Samson completed the erection of a two-storey house to the rear of the lot in 1844. The three roomed house was constructed of stone and brick walls and the roof was clad in shingles. In 1853 Samson erected a single storey shop containing three rooms to George Street frontage. The shop walls were constructed out of \\"Wood and Brick\\" and the roof was shingled. The Cottage of William and Martha Samson was considered \\"large\\" by the rating assessors in 1858. In 1882 Martha Samson sold Lot 7 to William Cope and Cunningham Archibald Atchison and in the year they conveyed the Cottage and shop to Alexander William Cormack, importer, of Snails Bay near Sydney. Tenants of the shop until 1882 (when it was demolished) were fruiterers and grocers. In 1882-83 the shop to George Street was pulled down and during 1883 Cormack erected a three-storey building containing two shops to George Street and lodging rooms over. The walls were constructed in brick and the roof clad with iron. The premises was divided into two tenements, each with nine rooms and were numbered 75 and 75.5. The tenants of the shops until 1900 (till they were resumed by the Government) were tobacconists, hairdresser, confectioner and bootmaker.SCRA 1979: KL/07 Archaeology notes: Lease to William BalmainAR033-035; AR037; AR044-045; AR145; AR149 by 1800.

George Street frontage not developed until 1883. =Samson's Cottage wall remains= In 1916, 75.5 George Street was leased as a household to Hong On Jang, a shipping provider (Sand's Directory). It is assumed that he was recognised to have elite social status of a merchant, perhaps similar but not to the extent of Quong Tart.Lydon 1991: 97 As a shipping provider, he was linked between the source of supply and visiting ships and would have interacted with the European community. Jane Lydon notes the coincidence that Hong On Jang as a shipping provider (1916 - 1924) coincides with the operating years of the Australian-China Mail Steamship.Lydon 1991: 75 Hong On Jang also offered board to his countrymen on his premises, first at his Harrington Street residency between 1904‚Äì11 and later on George Street from 1916 - 24. He was involved with the S.S Courtfield incident where on Christmas Day, 1908, the Collector of Customs sent a telegram to the Melbourne Head Office regarding eight Chinese stowaways found on the S.S Courtfield. The ship had arrived in Sydney from Hong Kong and through an interpreter, they were able to extract the information that these men were from rural Southern China and had arranged through a stranger in Hong Kong to come to Australia. The stowaways claimed that they did not know who was to meet them in Sydney but letters found on board were addressed to Hong On Jang in George Street asking him to house them until they could be sent further inland Sydney to their relatives. To resolve this incident, Chinese merchants of Sydney rallied together and raised 100pounds to send the men back on the first ship to China. This incident obviously did not tarnish Hong On Jang's reputation as other shipping companies (1910: Eastern and Australian Steamship Co. Ltd.; 1911 Norddeutscher Lloyd, P.P. Lohmann and Co., General Agents; 1911 Gibbs Bright and Co.) made requests to the Collector of Customs to allow Chinese passengers on their ships to board in Harrington Street temporarily before sailing to their final destination.Lydon 1999: 84 - 85 An archaeological excavation of the rear yard of 75.5 George Street was conducted by Lydon in 1990 and objects recovered demonstrate that there was a period of Chinese occupation in the early 20th century. Lydon later wrote that while the archaeological record of Chinese occupation in Sydney is limited, she singles out 75.5 George Street as the exception.Lydon 1999: 91 - 92 Her investigation shows that the boarders lived in a shed in the yard of 75.5 George Street. A large amount of Chinese ceramics (mainly storage vessels and also celadon rice bowls, stone ware \\"ginger-jars\\" and a stoneware 'sand-pot') were recovered and Lydon noted that majority of the Chinese ware was not intended for a foreign market.Lydon 1991: 60 - 63; Lydon 1999:97 - 99 European ceramics were also recovered along with a large amount of glass alcohol bottles and thirty-eight small glass vials with their necks snapped off. The glass vials have the Chinese characters \\"Tung Kwan Kok\\" printed on their bases and are assumed to be the maker's mark. These small vials were once thought to hold opium but are now believed to have held medicinal products. Since opium was banned in 1901 and was often used in patent painkillers and medicinal tinctures, it is suggested that addicts may have had resorted to opium-based products.Lydon 1991: 65; Lydon 1999: 100 - 101 Dolly Bonnet, who grew up in The Rocks during the 1920s, recalls that Chinese men would smoke opium in Kendall Lane, however, no artefacts associated with opium smoking such as opium pipes were recovered from 75.5 George Street.Iacono 1991; Lydon 1991: 65 Sheep bones along with a handful of pig, rabbit and cattle bones were also found from this period. Fish bones dominate the faunal assemblage including snapper, bream and wirrah cod and with the recovery of the \\"sand-pot\\", which was used for cooking rice as well as braising and making stews, it can be suggested that the traditional Chinese diet of fish and rice was upheld in 75.5 George Street, with the occasional supplement of meat. \\"Sand-pots\\" have rarely been found in an archaeological context outside of China. Its single presence at 75.5 George Street has led Lydon to also suggest that the custom of sharing food in order to create bonds between the Chinese were upheld in Hong On Jang's household.Lydon 1991: 59 , 60; Lydon 1999: 97, 99 Hong On Jang (or Que On Jang, who is listed as the occupant in the 1923 - 24 Sands Directory) ended his lease of 75.5 George Street in 1924. The building was then leased out to European tenants. In 1944, 75 George Street was utilised as a Chinese laundry and residence. Dolly Bonnet recalls the laundry drying out the back of Kendall Lane.Iaconno 1991 According to the SCA Tenancy CardsSAO 11/3374 and SCA property files, the tenant between 1946 - 47 was Soo Tim. The business along with the fittings was sold to Henry James in 1947. It is unknown whether Henry James was European or of Chinese descent but the painted sign \\"Chinese Laundry\\" remained on the windows,Johnson 2006: pers. comm. James was open for business until 1974. George Auchinachie, an antique dealer, was the next occupant in 1975 and he operated under the name of \\"Chinese Laundry Antiques\\".  Description  No 75-75.5 George Street is a pair of late Victorian shops having ornate well scaled stuccoed facades with projecting cornice and parapet above. A small pediment with the date 1883 rises above the parapet between the two facades. Pilasters decorated with columns, Corinthian capitals and cornices rise to the full height of the fa√ßade separating them from the two adjacent buildings and dividing the two shops.Croker 1976 Style: Victorian; Storeys: 3 plus Basement; Roof Cladding: Iron; Floor Frame: Timber Archaeology Notes: Building on George Street, 1883.

The site and building are also of State heritage significance for their contribution to The Rocks area which is of State Heritage significance in its own right. The buildings are located in an area which has been continuously settled since the arrival of Europeans in Australia, and the site has been more or less in continuous use as shops with attached residences/lodgings since its construction in the Victorian Period. It has been added to an 1840s building and contains elements of the 1840s which had been intended for an earlier building. It therefore illustrates the historic process of urban development and, in this particular case, of non- development due to economic circumstances in the 1840s. It demonstrates how early settlers of modest means were able to acquire land and develop it gradually prior to the economic boom of the late 1850s. Its bipartite division demonstrates a closer settlement and development of the land and together with Samson's Cottage wall remains illustrates the development of Sydney at ever higher densities. The loss of the rear yards to public use has destroyed evidence of its former residential use. This increasing public pedestrianisation of formerly private areas both lessens the site's significance and increases the importance of maintaining what little of the site is left. Its fa√ßade is well-modelled on Victorian mannerist fa√ßade which is an important, rare mannerist contribution to the streetscape of George Street North. It is an important component of George Street North and complements the buildings of different periods in the immediate vicinity. The method of construction, especially the manner in which the 1880s building has made use of the 1840s building to its south for support, illustrates the techniques of construction of the period. As the site has been in almost continuous use by Europeans for two centuries the ground under the building yield archaeological evidence of the land's earlier occupation. Samsons Cottage should also be considered to have high Chinese cultural value and significance due to its utilisation as a boarding house by Hong On Jang during the early 20th century. Hong On Jang provided accommodation to Chinese sojourners and passer-throughs. An archaeological excavation conducted in 1990 of the rear yard of Samson's Cottage further contributes to its Chinese cultural significance. Chinese objects found insitu around Sydney were considered to be a rare discovery and large amounts of Chinese ceramics, which were not intended for export outside of China, were recovered from the rear yard. From 1944 until 1974, 75 George Street was utilised as a Chinese laundry, one of the occupations adopted by Chinese sojourners who made the decision to remain in Australia. Samson's Cottage was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. It has been more or less in continuous use as shops with attached residences/lodgings since its construction in the Victorian Period. In this regard, its degree of significance is representative of the area. It has been added to an 1840s building and contains elements of the 1840s which had been intended for an earlier building. It therefore illustrates the historic process of urban development and, in this particular case, of non-development due to economic circumstances in the 1840s.

This increasing public pedestrianisation of formerly private areas both lessens the site's significance and increases the importance of maintaining what little of the site is left. In this regards, its degree of significance is representative in the area.Robertson & Hindmarsh 1998: 54-55 Samsons Cottage wall remains: 75.5 George Street can be considered to have high Historical Significance due to the unique archaeological assemblage recovered from the 1990 excavation. Whilst archaeological evidence of Chinese inhabitancy has rarely been found in Sydney, this building is an exception. Chinese ceramics found contemporary to this period are recognised as being rare and were not intended to be exported out of China (e.g. 'sand-pot'). Fish bones, which dominated the bones assemblage, indicate that the Chinese traditional diet of fish was maintained and occasionally supplemented with lamb, rabbit and cattle. The discovery of the \\"sand-pot\\" (used for cooking rice and also braising and stew) has led Lydon to believe that the inhabitants dined together, one of the traditional methods to form a bond within the household. Glass alcohol bottles recovered has also led Lydon to the conclusion that the Chinese inhabitants were adopting a social aspect of Australian culture. Alcohol was only consumed for medicinal purposes or at religious occasions in China. This is not to imply the assimilation of culture but rather the access to a larger market. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. Samsons Cottage wall remains: 75.5 George Street is associated with Hong On Jang, a Chinese merchant and shipping provider. Hong On Jang regularly boarded his countrymen within his household at his Harrington Street residency between 1904‚Äì11 and at 75.5 George Street between 1916 - 24. He was also involved with the S.S. Courtfield incident when 8 stowaways from China were found on board along with letters addressed to him, asking for him to temporarily board these men. As a Chinese merchant, Hong On Jang would have been recognised as being part of an elite class. He was a link between the source of supply and visited ships and it is assumed he would have had regular interaction with the European community. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Its George Street fa√ßade is well- modelled on Victorian mannerist fa√ßade which is an important, rare mannerist contribution to the streetscape of George Street North. In this regard, its degree of significance is rare in the area. It is an important component of George Street North and complements the buildings of different periods in the immediate vicinity. In this regard, its degree of significance is representative in the area.Robertson & Hindmarsh 1998: 55 The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Samsons Cottage wall remains: 75.5 George Street is of high social significance due to the artefacts recovered from its rear yard. Archaeological evidence of Chinese inhabitancy is rarely found in Sydney and Chinese ceramics that are seldom found outside of China were recovered. It is speculated by Lydon that the ceramics recovered (i.e. 'sand-pot') that within the Hong On Jang household the traditional custom of sharing meals was practised in order to create a social bond. 75.5 George Street is also socially significance because of its previous function as a boarding house. Hong On Jang provided accommodation to labourers who worked within the vicinity of The Rocks and also to Chinese sojourners passing through Sydney. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The method of construction, especially the manner in which the 1880s building has made use of the 1840s building to its south for support, illustrates the techniques of construction of the period. In this regard, its degree of significance is rare in the area. As the site has been in almost continuous use by Europeans and Chinese for two centuries the ground under the building which was not removed for the current could yield archaeological evidence of the land's earlier occupation. In this regard, its degree of significance is representative in the area. Samsons Cottage: 75.5 George Street has the potential to assist with future research on Chinese households and its archaeological assemblage can provide a comparison for any other future discoveries within Australia The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Chinese assemblage recovered from an archaeological excavation of its rear yard is considered to be a rare find within Sydney and some ceramic objects such as the \\"sand-pot\\" are seldom found outside of China. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. 75.5 George Street is representative of a boarding facilities set up for the Chinese sojourner who came to make a living in Sydney. 70 George Street, which was used as a Chinese laundry between 1944 - 1974, is representative of one of the Chinese occupations taken up by Chinese sojourners who made the decision to remain in Australia. Other occupations include market gardeners and vendors and cooks.

He showed top class form as a two-year-old in 2018 when he won two of his three races including the Group 1 Vertem Futurity Trophy. On his three-year-old debut he won the 2000 Guineas Stakes. Background Magna Grecia is a bay colt with a white sock on his left foreleg bred in Ireland by Woodnook Farm. In November 2016 the foal was put up for auction at Tattersalls and was bought for 340,000 guineas by Michael Magnier, Mayfair and P&R; Doyle. He entered the ownership of John Magnier's Coolmore Stud (represented by Susan Magnier, Michael Tabor and Derrick Smith) in partnership with the Niarchos family's Flaxman Stables. Like most Coolmore horses he was sent into training with Aidan O'Brien at Ballydoyle. He was sired by the Haydock Sprint Cup winner Invincible Spirit, who has produced many other major winners including Kingman, Charm Spirit, Mayson, Fleeting Spirit, Moonlight Cloud and Lawman. Magna Grecia's dam Cabaret, who was owned by Coolmore, won two races including the Silver Flash Stakes, and went on to become a very successful broodmare who also produced St Mark's Basilica. She was descended from the British broodmare Fiddlededee who was the ancestor of Mountain Lodge, Might and Power, Lucky Owners and Sariska. Racing career=2018: two-year-old season= Magna Grecia made his racecourse debut on 30 September over seven furlongs at Naas Racecourse when he started the 2/1 favourite for a maiden race. Ridden by Ryan Moore he raced in third before moving up on the inside to take the lead approaching the final furlong, drew away from his rivals in the closing stages and won \\"comfortably\\" by three and a half lengths. Two weeks later the colt was stepped up in class and sent to England for the Group 3 Autumn Stakes over one mile at Newmarket Racecourse in which he was ridden by his trainer's son Donnacha O'Brien and started the 3/1 second favourite behind the French colt Persian King. The last quarter mile saw a prolonged struggle between Persian King and Magna Grecia, with the favourite prevailing by a neck. The other O'Brien-trained runners Circus Maximus and Western Australia came home third and fourth. Aidan O'Brien said that he was \\"delighted\\" with the colt's performance. On 27 October Magna Grecia was back in England for the Group 1 Vertem Futurity Trophy over one mile on good to soft ground at Doncaster Racecourse. With Donnacha O'Brien in the saddle he was made the 2/1 favourite ahead of the John Gosden-trained Turgenev in a ten-runner field which included Circus Maximus, Western Australia, Phoenix of Spain, Raakib Alhawa (Haynes, Hanson and Clark Conditions Stakes) and Great Scot (Ascendant Stakes). After racing in mid-division as Western Australia set the pace he began to make progress in the last quarter mile and moved up to challenge for the lead entering the final furlong. In a rough, crowded and closely contested finish, which saw five horses almost level with 100 yards left to run he prevailed by a head from Phoenix of Spain, just ahead of Western Australia, Circus Maximus and Great Scot. The result was only confirmed after a lengthy inquiry by the racecourse stewards into possible interference between the first two finishers. Donnacha O'Brien said \\"There just was a little bit of a bump... but I don't think there was much in it. He gave me a good feel through the race. He will be better next year. I just had to keep him balanced and he toughed it out in the last furlong\\". =2019: three-year-old season= On his three-year- old debut Magna Grecia was one of seventeen colts to contest the 211th running of the 2000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket Racecourse and was partnered again by Donnacha O'Brien. He started the 11/2 second favourite behind his stablemate Ten Sovereigns while the other contenders included Madhmoon (Juvenile Stakes), Skardu (Craven Stakes), Advertise, Royal Marine, Shine So Bright (European Free Handicap) and Great Scot. While the bulk of the field raced up the centre of the track Magna Grecia, Shine So Bright and the 66/1 outsider King of Change raced down the stands-side (the left-hand side from the jockeys' viewpoint). In the last quarter mile it became clear that the stands-side trio held a distinct advantage and Magna Grecia overtook Shine So Bright to take the lead approaching the final furlong. Magna Grecia forged clear in the closing stages to win by two and a half lengths from King of Change, with Skardu finishing best of the centre group in third ahead of Madhmoon and Ten Sovereigns. Aidan O'Brien, who was winning the race for a record tenth time said \\"He's a lovely, straightforward horse and he's done very well over the winter. He's got very pacy and he's a strong traveller now. We were a little bit worried that he was over there by himself when all the more fancied horses were on the other side. Donnacha knew the horse, he was riding him in all his work, so I didn‚Äôt have to explain much to him.\\" Three weeks after his win at Newmarket Magna Grecia was ridden by Moore when he started 6/4 joint favourite with Too Darn Hot for the Irish 2,000 Guineas at the Curragh. Racing on firmer ground he tracked the leaders but was unable to quicken in the last quarter mile and came home fifth behind Phoenix of Spain, Too Darn Hot, Decrypt and Skardu. He sustained a tendon injury in the race and was off the track until the autumn. Donnacha O'Brien took the ride when Magna Grecia made his comeback in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes over the straight mile course at Ascot Racecourse on 19 October. Racing on heavy ground he started at odds of 13/2 but tired badly in the last quarter mile and came home fifteenth of the sixteen runners behind King of Change, beaten more than thirty lengths by the winner.

The Chinese Eastern Railroad electoral district was located outside the borders of Russia. In March 1917, in response to the abdication of the Tsar, Lieutenant General Dmitri Horvath (the Chinese Eastern Railroad Zone administrator since 1902) proclaimed an 'All Russian Provisional Government' based in Harbin. However, Horvath's regime was soon challenged by emergence of soviet power in the Chinese Eastern Railroad Zone (to the dismay of Western powers). Nevertheless, Harbin was far detached from events in Petrograd and a more liberal atmosphere prevailed in Russian politics there; foreign diplomats took note that the monarchist Horvath and the Bolshevik leader Martemyan Ryutin could meet for lunch at the Railway Club in Harbin.Wolff, David.

The first formal Social Democratic meeting occurred in Vladivostok on March 10, 1917, with twenty attendees. Five days later, a second meeting was held with a hundred party members in attendance and electing a provisional committee chaired by A. Antonov. On March 12, 1917 the first Menshevik Social Democratic party meeting was held in Blagoveshchensk, which elected S. G. Bukharevich as chair of the Party Branch Committee. Social Democratic organizations were established in Khabarovsk, Nikolsk-Ussuriysky, Suchan, Muraev-Amursky, Razdolnoye, Bozkarevo, Magdagachi and Gondatti. By July 1917, there were some 2,850 Social Democratic party members in the Russian Far East.

After immigrating from Mexico to San Antonio in 1926, Romulo secured a job with the Spanish language newspaper La Prensa. The family soon followed him to San Antonio. Romulo eventually opened Munguia Printers, ‚Äúa family owned business that became a central place for political activism‚Äù. Her mother became one of the first female Mexican radio personalities on the West Side of San Antonio. Elvira began her lifelong devotion to her culture when, as a child, she assisted her parents as they established parent teacher organizations, community newspapers, and in their radio programs which centered on Mexican literature and culture. Elvira and her six siblings were raised in the Prospect Hill area of San Antonio's West side where, in elementary school, Elvira went to Sacred Heart School. She left parochial school for Washington Irving Junior High, and went on to graduate from Jefferson High School. While at Jefferson High School she was on the archery team and she danced Mexican folklorico with the cultural club, Seleni, sponsored by the Mexican Consulate. After high school, Elvira moved to Austin, Texas, to attend the University of Texas at Austin. During this time, WWII was underway and Elvira's three older brothers enlisted in the military. Elvira returned to San Antonio to help with the family business. While back in San Antonio tending to her family, Elvira studied at Draughon's Business College and enhanced her bookkeeping skills working at her family's print shop. After Draughon, she started a job at Frost Bank in downtown San Antonio.  Marriage & family  During Elvira's tenure at Frost Bank, she spent her evenings at nearby Santa Rosa Hospital caring for her younger brother, Henry, who wound up passing away from Hodgkins disease in 1943, at age 14. She also helped care for her youngest sister, Stella, who was afflicted by, and died from, polio. Through her brother Ruben, who was stationed at Randolph Field, Elvira met George Cisneros, who was a fellow World War II combat veteran stationed in San Antonio. The two eventually married on November 25, 1945 and had 5 children together: Henry (1947), Pauline (1949), George Jr. (1952), Tim (1957), and Christina (1960).

Bowden later attended St. Augustine's Normal School in Raleigh, North Carolina, where she graduated in 1900.  Personal life  Bowden was the oldest of four children. When she was young, she was taught how to cook, sew, and play the piano. She never married but was known to be married to her school and civic duty. She was also known for her confidence. ‚ÄúMiss Esdale Malloy...described her ‚Äòas a person of supreme confidence, one who felt she could overcome any obstacle\\". Bowden spent much of her life fighting for equal education and rights for African Americans. A few examples of her roles in civic programs were ‚Äúthe introduction of a black nursing unit in Robert E. Green Hospital, for securing Lindbergh Park for black residents, and for establishing the East Side Settlement House.‚Äù In 1935 she received her bachelor's degree at St. Augustine's College and an honorary degree from Wiley College for her efforts and accomplishments in Texas.  Career  After graduating from St. Augustine's Normal School in Raleigh in 1900, she became an educator at St. Joseph's Parochial School in Fayetteville, North Carolina. After a year of teaching at St. Joseph's Parochial School she accepted another position at High Point Normal and Industrial School in High Point, North Carolina. Bowden continued teaching at High Point for one more year, during which time she received another opportunity. Bishop James Johnston began a search for a qualified individual to take the position of chief administrator and primary teacher at St. Philip's Normal and Industrial School in San Antonio, Texas. Bowden accepted the position and arrived in 1902, and as principal, Bowden made many changes to St. Philip's Day School. Under her administration she divided the departments into a primary and secondary grammar school and a vocational school. In the vocational program Bowden focused on teaching young women reading, writing, algebra, history, botany, sewing and cooking, and other homemaking skills. In 1907 there was an integration of vocational and industrial skills in public schools and because the tuition at St. Philip's was high for the times, St. Philip's saw a decrease in the number of students enrolled. Bowden sought out students from outside of San Antonio and also added a Normal Department to prepare elementary school teachers, and by 1908 low enrollment was no longer an issue. In 1917 she helped move the school to its most current location on the San Antonio East Side. In 1926, Artemisia Bowden set out to help the school achieve the next level in higher education for her school, junior college status. She fundraised for her school and with the support of the American Church Institute for Negroes the school was able to obtain \\"a new main building, which included classrooms, space for boarding students, a gym, music rooms, a dining hall, a handicraft room and a library.\\" In September 1927, St. Philip's Junior College opened. During the Great Depression, in 1934, the Episcopal Church and Diocese of West Texas renounced the fiscal responsibilities of St. Philips leaving Bowden with an impending foreclosure and lost assets. Bowden looked to friends, family, and her community for financial assistance. When her father died, she used $1,000 out of the $2,000 inheritance she received for school obligations such as school supplies and teacher salaries. She also began a campaign to have the San Antonio School Board assume fiscal responsibilities but was rejected several times. On September 15, 1942 St. Philip's Junior College was accepted by the San Antonio School Board as the first junior black college governed by a city school board and Artemisia Bowden became its Vice President. In 1954, after 52 years of service Artemisia Bowden retired with the title Dean Emeritus.  Legacy  Artemisia Bowden passed away on August 18, 1969, in San Antonio. She was cremated and interred in Corpus Christi, Texas. Bowden is recognized not only for her contributions to the success of St. Philip's College,\\"Artemisia Bowden: The Founder of St. Philip's College by Beverly Bragg\\". www.uiw.edu. Retrieved 2018-11-05. but also for her leadership and success in civic and welfare projects for African Americans in greater San Antonio. Bowden received an honorary degree from both Wiley College in 1935 and Tillotson College in 1952 for her civic work. She served as president of the San Antonio Metropolitan Council of Negro Women, founded and served as president of the Negro Business and Professional Women's Club and founded the Bowden Chapter of Business and Professional Women.‚Äù In 1955 Zeta Phi Beta sorority named her woman of the year.

In \\"Sex and Caste\\" (November 1965),Document 86A: Casey Hayden (aka Sandra Cason) and Mary King, \\"Sex and Caste,\\" 18 November 1965, Liberation Magazine, April 1966, Elaine DeLott Baker Papers, Schlesinger Library, Radcliffe Institute, Harvard University. pp. 35-36. https://womhist.alexanderstreet.com/SNCC/doc86A.htm a reworking of an internal memo they had drafted with other SNCC women, Hayden and Mary King drew \\"parallels\\" with the experience of African-Americans to suggest that women are \\"caught up in a common-law caste system that operates, sometimes subtly, forcing them to work around or outside hierarchical structures of power.\\" Since regarded as a bridge connecting civil rights to women's liberation, Hayden describes its publication as her \\"last action as a movement activist.\\" In the decades since, she has continued to acknowledge the civil-rights struggle of the era as the forerunner for women, and for all those, who have taken up \\"the idea of organising for themselves.\\"  Early life  Casey Hayden was born Sandra Cason on October 31, 1937, in Austin, Texas, as a fourth-generation Texan. She was raised in Victoria, Texas, in a \\"‚Äúmultigenerational matriarchal family‚ÄùCasey Hayden (2010). \\"In the Attics of my Mind.\\" Written for Hands on the Freedom Plow: Personal Accounts by Women in SNCC.

An unconventional arrangement, she believed it cultivated in her from the outset an affinity for those on the margins.Davis W. Houck, David E. Dixon (2009) Women and the Civil Rights Movement, 1954-1965. University Press of Mississippi. p. 135  Campus activist  In 1957 Cason enrolled as junior at The University of Texas. She moved out of campus dorms into the Social Gospel and racially-integrated Christian Faith and Life Community, and as officer of Young Women's Christian Association and member of the Social Action Committee of the university's Religious Council was soon engaged in civil-rights education and protest. Continuing from 1959 as a UT English and philosophy graduate student, she participated in a successful sit-in campaign to desegregate Austin-area restaurants and theaters. In a dramatic intervention at the National Student Association convention in Minneapolis in August 1960, Cason turned back a broadly-supported motion that objecting to sit-ins would have denied support to the fledgling Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). ‚ÄúI cannot say to a person who suffers injustice, ‚ÄòWait,‚Äô And having decided that I cannot urge caution, I must stand with him.‚Äù Among the delegates who, after a moments silence, gave her a standing ovation was SDS president Alan Haber, whom, as she recalls, \\"scooped\\" her \\"up,\\" and Tom Hayden editor of University of Michigan student newspaper. Stirred by her \\"ability to think morally [and] express herself poetically,\\" he followed her into Haber's new left-wing grouping.Smith (2015). p. 365 At the SNCC second coordinating conference in Atlanta in October 1960, Cason reported herself transfixed by the idea of the Beloved Community as espoused by James Lawson and Diane Nash of the Nashville Student Movement.Houck and Dixon (2009). p. 135  With the SNCC in the South In the summer of 1961 Cason moved to New York City and lived with Tom Hayden. In a ceremony invoking Albert Camus--\\"I, on the other hand, choose justice in order to remain faithful to the world\\"‚Äîthey married in October, and then moved to Atlanta.Smith (2015). p. 369 \\"Godmother of the SNCC\\" Ella Baker had hired Cason (now Casey Hayden) for a YWCA special project, travelling to southern campuses to conduct integrated race-relations workshops (secretly in the case of some white schools). She also worked in the SNCC office on, among other projects, preparations for the Freedom Riders who were to challenge non-enforcement of the United States Supreme Court decision Boynton v. Virginia (1960). In December, as Freedom Riders themselves, the Haydens were arrested in Albany, Georgia. It was from the jail cell that Tom Hayden began drafting what was to become the Port Huron Statement, adopted by the SDS at its convention in June 1962 in Ann Arbor, Michigan. With Tom Hayden elected SDS president for the 1962‚Äì1963 academic year, and Casey Hayden heeding the SNCC call to return to Atlanta, they separated, divorcing in 1965. While she had had the reputation in the SDS of being \\"one of the boys,\\" much of the discussion within the SDS inner circle struck her as young men posturing. Her heart was with the SNCC where, consistent with the focus on action, greater value was placed on building relationships, and where women, Black women, spoke out.Smith (2015). p. 372 In 1963, Casey Hayden moved to Mississippi where, along with Doris Derby, she was asked to begin a literacy project at Tougaloo College in an all-black community outside Jackson. The comparative safety of the college was a consideration: out in the field the increased visibility she brought as a white woman was a risk not only to herself, but also to her comrades. But it was also important to Hayden that the \\"request was specifically made\\" because of her background in English education: > As a Southerner, I considered the Southern Freedom Movement Against > Segregation mine as much any one else's. I was working for my right to be > with who I chose to be with as I chose to be with them. It was my freedom. > However, when I worked full time in the black community I considered myself > a guest of that community, which required decency and good manners, as every > Southerner knows. I considered myself a support person; my appropriate role > was to provide support from behind the lines, not to be a leader in any > public way. It was not that within SNCC she did not have a \\"right to leadership\\" but that \\"it would have been counterproductive.\\" Not being \\"a leader in any public way,\\" however, did not leave Hayden feeling in any way excluded. Although she appears quicker to recognize the advantage it was to her as a woman in the movement than to her as a \\"guest\\" in the community, Hayden noted that because of \\"the participatory, town-hall, consensus-forming nature of the SNCC operation\\" being \\"on the Executive Committee or a project director didn't carry much weight anyway.\\"Casey Hayden (2015), \\"Only Love Is Radical.\\" Inspiring Participatory Democracy: Student Movements from Port Huron to Today, ed. Tom Hayden. New York: Routledge, 2015, p. 65. Her ability to make decisions and to control her own work was not a matter of formal position. In 1964 she became organizer and strategist for Freedom Summer and for the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party in the challenge they were to mount to the seating of the all-white regulars at the 1964 Democratic National Convention. She explains that in those roles: > I did the work all the way up and down. That means I did my own typing and > mimeographing and mailing and I also did my own research and analysis and > writing and decision making, the latter usually in conversation with other > staff. As we said at the time, both about our constituencies and ourselves, > \\"The people who do the work should make the decisions.\\" There were no > secretaries in SNCC, with the exception of Norma Collins in the Atlanta > office, so there was no office hierarchy.

This still suggested too loose, too confederal a structure for the party-political direction on which Forman and others were now travelling.

She was not asked about the issues raised by Sex and Caste but was pressed on black- white division within the SNCC Mississippi operation, particularly in the light of calls for Black Power and black separatism. She allowed that there was an understandable degree of frustration, even resentment, felt by the local black staff, \\"the backbone\\" of the project, in having to deal \\"with a lot of young white people who were intellectual and moneyed.\\" Calls for Black Power only came later, after Freedom Summer, and were in great measure a reaction, she believed, to continued political exclusion, something which the refusal to accredit the MFDP at the Democratic convention had dramatically symbolized: \\"it was like, if you won't let us in, we'll do our own thing.\\" Division of any kind, however, was not her abiding memory of the movement.

She continued dancing and water skiing until she was 92. She died July 1, 2018, in her home in Terrell Hills San Antonio, Texas of congestive heart failure at the age of 100.  Philanthropy and legacy  McAllister herself would say that she became bored with ‚Äúsitting around playing cards‚Äù, and first began volunteering with the San Antonio Junior League. She had the support and mentor-ship of her husband's father, Walter McAllister Sr. Her efforts in Junior League expanded to fundraising for the development of Southwest Craft Center in 1972, now the Southwest School of Art and Craft, a four-year art school in San Antonio. She served as a Girl Scout Leader, president of the Alamo Heights Junior School PTA, and Mistress of the Robes for the Fiesta coronation of 1965. She volunteered her time to help develop San Antonio.

She was one of the first Mexican Americans to join the Democratic Women's Club and recruited other women from the Hispanic and African-American communities. She served as campaign manager for her husband Albert Pe√±a, Jr. and helped him get elected as Bexar County Commissioner.  Early life and education  Pe√±a was born in San Antonio in 1925. Her parents were originally from Mexico and had immigrated to the United States when they were young, becoming U.S. citizens in 1937. Pe√±a's childhood home was in West San Antonio in a segregated neighborhood. Her mother, Francis Navarro Diaz was a stay at home mom and cared for her and her 2 younger brothers, Guadalupe and Hugo. Her father, Guadalupe Gutierrez Ramos worked for a Mexican-owned soda manufacturer as a beverage delivery driver who delivered to various retailers in the San Antonio area. Pe√±a, the oldest child, had two brothers, both veterans of wars. Her father used to drive her to school in his delivery truck as the family owned no vehicle. Pe√±a was educated and graduated from a segregated public school system in Bexar County. In her own words, ‚ÄúI grew up in the West Side on Leona Street and went to Navarro School for elementary and then to Joel Chandler Harris and finally San Antonio Tech High School.‚Äù As she recalls,‚ÄúI had a very bad accent and spoke no English, but was very lucky that I got one of the teachers who was bilingual, so she could teach us in both languages.  Career  Pe√±a has been involved with various organizations, including the Democratic Women's Club, American GI Forum, and LULAC. She was responsible for the organization of multiple political movements, the running of Albert's campaigns, and has achieved status in many activist groups, including being the first Mexican member of the Democratic Women Club. She retired in 1996 in order to take care of her aging parent.  Personal life  As a child, Pe√±a loved dancing. From the age of 8 she enlisted the teachings of many neighborhood women dancers until she was proficient in dozens of traditional Mexican dances. She danced at assemblies in school, and dancing was her first paid job. She would dance at local San Antonio events and sometimes even traveled to other cities for performances.

In the 1970s, she actively participated in the Chicano movement as a member of the Mexican American Youth Organization (MAYO) and as an organizer in the Raza Unida Party (RUP).  Early life and education  Canales was born in Rosita, Texas, to migrant parents and raised in Edinburg, Texas. Her family claimed ties to the land long before the United States annexed Texas in 1845. All family members worked as migrant farm workers during the summers, and their work took them seasonally from West Texas to Michigan. From a young age, Canales witnessed discriminatory practices in West Texas toward migrant workers. The itinerant life of her farm working family made it difficult to establish a track record in school. However, Canales persevered to graduate from Edinburg High School in 1965 and received a journalism scholarship from the Edinburg Daily Review to attend University of Texas Pan American.  Career and activism  The journalism scholarship enabled Canales to work as a reporter with the Edinburg Daily Review. She also wrote for her college paper.\\"Oral History Interview with Alma Canales,\\". library.uta.edu. Retrieved 2018-11-08. In the role of reporter, Canales looked further into events concerning Mexican American migrant workers and discrimination. At the height of the Vietnam War, Canales reported on casualties among young Chicano men. She noted the irony of young Mexican American boys being sent to war to fight for freedom and American democracy while still experiencing discrimination in South Texas. Her reporting on the war led to her increased participation in the MAYO. Canales wrote for the Castro County News for a short time before moving in 1969 to Wisconsin as part of the Colorado Migrant Council to establish childcare centers. She returned to Edinburg, Texas later that summer to continue projects for the Colorado Migrant Council. She later enrolled in Colegio Jacinto Trevino in Mercedes, Texas during which time she traveled to Mexico City as a representative of the United States Department of Education. The university disbanded before Canales could finish her degree. Drawing from her experiences in MAYO and at Colegio Jacinto Trevino, Canales directed her energy into the early formation of Partido Raza Unida. In 1972, Canales accepted the RUP nomination for Lieutenant Governor of Texas. She was the first Chicana to run for this statewide position. She garnered 88,000 votes running on a platform that challenged discrimination and poverty. Shortly following the election, Canales left the RUP over differences with the direction of the party and moved to Waco, Texas. Canales continued her activism by participating in the League of Women Voters, Waco Peacemaker Alliance, and as deputy director of the League of United Latin American Citizens Waco Council 273.  Legacy  Alma Canales made history for women and for Chicanas specifically.

In 1918, she was one of the first five women to be elected to the Landsting. The others were Nina Bang, Marie Hjelmer, Olga Knudsen and Inger Gautier Schmidt. Biography Born on 12 December 1860 in P√•bol near Ringk√∏bing, Jutland, Kirsten Marie Christensen was the daughter of the estate owner Mads Christian Christensen (1827‚Äì1904) and Karen Jensen (1833‚Äì1879). She was raised on an estate in the west of Jutland as the second oldest of nine children. The family was strongly oriented towards the Danish Liberals, her elder brother Jens Christian becoming a key figure after the political reforms of 1901. She had set her mind on becoming a teacher but her plans were upset when her mother died in 1879 and she had to bring up the remainder of the family. Nevertheless, a few years later, she attended Horsens Kvindeseminarium, a teacher training college for women in Horsens. On receiving her diploma in 1882, she taught in a number of villages until she arrived in Bagterp near Hj√∏rring where she taught until 1925. She became active in the Hj√∏rring branch of the Danish Women's Society from 1910 to 1917. In Bagterp, she became increasingly active in politics, providing assistance to both criminals and neglected children. It was therefore not surprising that she was put forward as a candidate for Venstre for the 1918 elections. Once elected, she successfully supported parents' influence on the school system though she opposed the school matriculation examination as a prerequisite to a teaching diploma. She was in favour of assisting the children of working mothers, bringing about legislative reforms thanks to her political influence. In 1931, she also ardently supported the establishment of a university in Aarhus. She remained a member of the Landsting until 1932, constantly working towards better conditions for children and schools, including improvements in teacher training. Marie Christensen died on 22 December 1935 in Copenhagen.

It was formed in October 1942 during World War II from the first formation of the 154th Rifle Division as the 47th Guards Rifle Division. It served with the 8th Guards Army from late 1943. In late 1945, the division was converted into the 19th Guards Mechanized Division as part of the Group of Soviet Occupation Forces in Germany. It was ultimately relocated to Hillersleben as part of the 3rd Shock Army (later the 3rd Army) and served there with the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany for the rest of the Cold War, being converted to the 26th Guards Tank Division in 1957 and renumbered to restore its original number in 1965.  World War II  The 47th Guards Rifle Division was formed on 20 October 1942 by the conversion of the first formation of the 154th Rifle Division for the latter's \\"courage and heroism\\" during the Kozelsk Offensive. It included the 437th, 473rd, and 510th Rifle Regiments, the 571st Artillery Regiment, and smaller units. The commander of the 154th, Major General Yakov Fokanov, continued in command of the 47th Guards. The division's units received Guards designations on 26 December, with the rifle regiments becoming the 137th, 140th, and 142nd Guards, while the artillery regiment became the 99th Guards.  Postwar  In late May 1945, the division with the 8th Guards Army became part of the newly created Group of Soviet Occupation Forces in Germany (renamed the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany (GSFG) in 1954). In late 1945, the 47th Guards Rifle Division was converted into the 19th Guards Mechanized Division. The latter included three mechanized regiments and two tank regiments: the 62nd, 63rd, and 64th Guards Mechanized Regiments, formed from the 137th, 140th, and 142nd Guards Rifle Regiments, and the 26th and 153rd Tank Regiments, the former 244th Separate Tank Regiment and 153rd Tank Brigade, respectively. It was subsequently transferred to the 3rd Shock Army (the 3rd Army from 1954) in 1947, joining the 79th Rifle Corps. The corps was renumbered as the 23rd in 1955 and disbanded a year later, leaving the division directly subordinated to the army headquarters. On 17 May 1957 the division was converted into the 26th Guards Tank Division. The 63rd and 64th Guards Mechanized Regiments were accordingly disbanded, while the 62nd Guards became the 245th Guards Motor Rifle Regiment. To replace the disbanded units, the 49th Guards Tank Regiment was transferred to the 26th Guards from the 12th Guards Tank Division. The division was renumbered as the 47th Guards to restore its World War II designation on 11 January 1965. The 49th Guards was subsequently renumbered as the 197th Guards in addition. As the Cold War ended, the GSFG was reduced in size and renamed the Western Group of Forces. Following the Dissolution of the Soviet Union at the end of 1991, the division became part of the Russian Ground Forces. In April 1993 the division began its withdrawal to Mulino in the Moscow Military District. The division was disbanded by merging it with the 31st Tank Division of the Moscow Military District into the 3rd Motor Rifle Division at Nizhny Novgorod in 1997.

She is the mother of Julian Castro and Joaqu√≠n Castro.  Early life and education  Born to Victoria Castro and Edward Perez, Rosie was raised by her mother and a guardian, Marcia Garcia, in San Antonio.https://www.expressnews.com/150years/people/article/Rosie-Castro- community-and-political-activist-6153232.php Growing up in the San Antonio barrio, Castro cited the beginning of her interest in social justice in witnessing the racial and economic boundaries that affected her family, especially her mother. With a scholarship from her valedictorian title and other financial means, she successfully enrolled at Our Lady of the Lake University, intending to become a teacher, before earning a degree in Spanish in 1971. At OLLU, she joined with the Catholic Youth Association, but took issue with the organization's lack of minority membership. It was at OLLU that Castro first became involved in student activism through the Young Democrats, and organizing the campus-required Young Republicans chapter in response.  Career and activism  Rosie first worked as a volunteer for Lyndon B. Johnson‚Äôs 1964 presidential campaign. Later she joined with the Mexican American Unity Council. With MAUC, she participated in and helped to organize the organization‚Äôs boycott of the San Antonio Savings Association, a savings and loan operation headed by former San Antonio Mayor Walter McAllister. Rosie was active during the \\"Free Angela Davis\\" Campaign of 1971, and during this period she was under observation by the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation. Castro worked with the Raza Unida Party's 1970s initiative to field Mexican-American candidates in Texas, serving as the Bexar County party chair. At the time, the RUP worked alongside the San Antonio Committee for Barrio Betterment to pursue positions in the city. With the CBB, Castro herself became a candidate in 1971 for the San Antonio City Council, finishing second among four candidates.

In the 20th century it belonged to the Nunburnholme family. The estate was acquired by Savills in 1954, who put it on the market in 2011 for about $8 million. It became a listed building on 19 July 1985. Architecture Arthingworth Manor is a two-storey brick house. Stone wall traces remain from an earlier 18th century dwelling. The left projecting wing no longer exists. The right wing features a canted end, and a flat roof, added in the 20th century. It contains a staircase with quarter landings and a turned balustrade. The dining room is situated in the eastern side, and has a large bay overlooking the eastern and southern gardens. The stables to the east date to the 18th century and have been converted into a house by Kellet & Partners, which is now known as \\"The Manor\\" and the older house the \\"Old Manor\\".

They were founded on two different dates, Candler College in 1899 and Colegio Buenavista in 1920. They both ceased to exist in 1961 when they were nationalized by the revolutionary government of Fidel Castro. Administration left These schools intended to provide bilingual education in Spanish and English, based on the Christian faith. They offered from the pre-school level until finishing high school to Cuban children and youth, as part of the mission of the church on the island. Although they were administered by different dependencies of the Methodist Church of Florida (United States), these two schools developed all their activities in coordination. Candler College offered elementary education only to boys while Colegio Buenavista provided primary education for girls. Young girls enrolled in Buenavista attended secondary education programs at Candler College; they only received religion and physical education classes at the Buenavista facilities. Some of Candler's boys did the seventh and eighth grades in English at Colegio Buenavista to be able to follow the United States High School curriculum. The younger boys also went to Kindergarten along with the girls. Candler College had a boarding school for boys only. Similarly, Buenavista provided the boarding for young girls and ladies. The two schools had separate lunch services for students who did not live a short distance away from them. In order to give its graduates and other students, the opportunity to continue university studies, at Candler College Candler University was organized in 1956, opening the Faculties of Pedagogy, Languages, Philosophy, and Letters, Pharmacy and Commercial Sciences to begin in 1957. These institutions grew in number of students and in prestige over the years until their educational work was interrupted in 1961 when the Castro regime nationalized all the private educational establishments (religious and lay). During the years in which Candler College and Colegio Buenavista existed, both schools provided a successful service to Cuban youth preparing their students for civic life by providing, in addition to official instruction, an integral formation based on Christian, moral and patriotic values. History left The first Methodist school in Cuba was founded in 1899 by the American missionary Thad E. Leland on Calle Virtudes de La Habana. This was founded when the Bishop of the Methodist Church of Florida, the Rev. Warren Akin Candler, proposed to give a new impetus to the missionary work begun in Cuba in 1883, through educational projects.

In addition to offering elementary and secondary education, between 1924 and 1946 at Candler College, a theological seminary was held, the School of Pastors, which was under the direction of the Reverend B.

He was replaced in 1949 by the Reverend Carlos P√©rez Ramos, who had been assistant director since 1946. Under his direction, the school continued to grow and other buildings and facilities were built to meet new requirements. Colegio Buenavista was founded in 1920 by the Women's Missionary Board of the Methodist Church to provide a Christian education for girls and young women and to respond to the request of the parents of Candler College students who demanded an education for their daughters of a quality similar to that of their brothers. This women's school began to operate in a residence surrounded by gardens that acquired the church across Miramar street, along the side of the Candler.Haskin, Sarah Estelle.

Until 1960, the directors of Colegio Buenavista were American missionaries who had carried out evangelization and social work for the Methodist Church in different parts of the island. Under his direction the school grew at the same pace as Candler College. Miss Belle Markey, the first director, was followed by Miss Junia Jones and then by Miss Ione Clay, who held the position for more than 25 years, until her retirement in 1956, and was replaced by Miss Juanita Kelly, who was succeeded by Miss Lorraine Buck. Four months before the nationalization of the school, the Reverend Humberto Carrazana, pastor of the Methodist Church of Marianao, was named director of Colegio Buenavista. For several decades, the schools were considered among the best in Cuba and \\"many graduates were accepted in the best universities in the United States without taking admission exams.\\"P√©rez Ramos, Carlos.

Some banks and other commercial companies often offered vacant positions to students of the school that were close to finishing their studies of Accountant and Secretariat. Location, buildings and facilities left Buildings of Candler College Candler College was located in the southeastern corner of the intersection of Miramar (Calle 54) and Guti√©rrez (Ave. 43) in La Ceiba neighbourhood, Marianao. Candler's main entrance was on Guti√©rrez Street (Ave.43) and gave access to the gardens in the front part of the main building, where the offices were on the ground floor and the bedrooms for the pupils in the second and third floors. Through this entrance, taking to the left, were the Martian Corner and the two-story building where the High School classes were held. At the back of this building, which opened onto Calle Lanuza (Calle 52), an entrance was opened for the students of Candler University. There were three other entrances on Calle Miramar (Ave. 54): one that was used to enter the Chapel, the next allowed the entrance of cars to the esplanade and parking place; this entrance had on the right the two-story building of the School of Commerce, with its well-equipped classrooms and spacious corridors, and to the left was the Library building, which also had two floors. Surrounding the esplanade were the back of the main building with its long corridors, the front of the High School building, the dining room and kitchen with the apartment for the director on the second floor and the three-story building that occupied the School of Baccalaureate, with its laboratories and the Museum of Natural Sciences, in addition to classrooms. Separated by a fence was the field for sports, the squash court and beyond the ground and the ballpark. The third entrance was the building of the Elementary School, in front of Font Street (Ave. 45). On the opposite side of the street, there was another sports field on the corner of 54th Street and 45th Ave. The Gymnasium, with its modern wooden floor for playing basketball and indoor volleyball and a stage at the back, was located in the southwest corner of 56th Street and 45th Ave. The main building of Buenavista on 54th Street Colegio Buenavista was located in front of the entrances on the side of Candler, on the southwestern corner of 54th Street and 43rd Avenue. The main Buenavista building had three entrances on Calle Miramar (Calle 54): the first was a gate to enter the main building, the beautiful mansion that was adapted to the initial needs of the school. On the ground floor were: the materials room, the kitchen, the dining room, and two classrooms. On the facade there were two converging stairs on a large terrace that gave access to the offices, the library, and the hall, from where a corridor led to the infirmary, the bedrooms and bathrooms for the pupils and the director, on the second floor. On the third floor, there were more bedrooms for the older pupils and the missionaries. To the left of this building, there was an entrance for cars, gardens, a garage, and a small room. A hallway to the left led to the classrooms, lined along 54th Street and 45th Ave, which limited the large courtyard with its gardens. This included recreational areas, the platform for cultural activities, the Martian Corner and, on the other side, the tennis and volleyball court. A third entrance to the gardens of Calle Miramar led to a vestibule that separated a small religious meditation room and a classroom and the long corridor that gave access to classrooms. There was also an entrance through the back of the patio, on Calle Primelles (Calle 56). Crossing this street, a small door allowed access to the sports ground for the students of Buenavista. The Auditorium of both schools was built next to this land, located in the south- western corner of 56th Street and 43rd Ave. Diagonal to this, in the northeast corner, with the entrance by Ave. 43, was the building of two stories with a smaller playground for students from pre-school to third grade. Both schools in total occupied a vast lot whose area of more than 32,000 square meters was bounded by 45th Ave to the south, 52nd Street to the east, 58th Street to the west and 43rd Ave to the north. This large area was crossed by three streets: Calle 54, Ave. 45 and Calle 56, which separated the buildings of the schools and the sports grounds, the gymnasium, and the auditorium. Basics Candler College and Buenavista College were grounded in the creed and discipline of the Methodist church. They were opened to prepare students for their future life outside of school on the basis of Christian faith and practice as well as moral, civic and patriotic values. Its purposes were to provide a comprehensive education that would contribute to the personal development of students as individuals and members of society and raise the educational level of the newly founded republic. =Methodist approach= Candler College Chapel. Corner of 54th Street and 43rd Avenue According to the thought of John Wesley, a good education was considered \\"one of the best ways to transform individuals, communities and societies as a whole\\" for their betterment and the glory of God. Education was not only the acquisition of academic knowledge but also wisdom and humility, which was founded on the teachings of Christ, in order to grow intellectually, personally and spiritually. The search for truth was encouraged through reason, research and debate, based on freedom of thought and expression. High academic standards were promoted as well as the development of talents through varied activities. As a result, challenges were posed to students, they were inspired and supported to achieve their best through self-discipline and a strong work ethic. Candler and Buenavista maintained a distinctive approach to education that incorporated Christian ethical values. The Methodist Social Creed emphasizes interest in social welfare and justice as well as the need to combat prejudice and intolerance in whatever form they take by strengthening mutual respect and understanding. So tolerant attitudes and behaviors were reinforced, respectful and non- discriminatory. It was hoped that students would learn to differentiate good and evil based on Christian and moral values. Family values based on love and mutual understanding and support were an important part of the formation of students. High ideals of patriotism were present in the education of the students: love their homeland and be loyal to it, respect and honor the national emblems and recognize the merits of the main forgers of the nation, know its history, culture and traditions as well as the achievements of the newly created republic and interested in the needs and problems of its people and their efforts to solve them. The civic values of freedom and democracy and the norms of coexistence related to rights and duties had a central place in the task of preparing future citizens as well as inculcating good manners and the appropriate habits required to live in society. The strong ties with the Florida Methodist Church Conference, which partially supported both colleges, were evident in the influence of American culture and traditions in schools. The flag of the United States was present in all the parties and ceremonies along with the Cuban flag and the national anthems of the two countries were sung. Hymns and emblems The principle adopted by Candler College as a guide was Consilio et Prudentia (Wisdom and Prudence). The motto of Colegio Buenavista, which appears on his seal, was Esse quam Videri (Ser instead of appearing). The pennants of Candler College bore the distinctive colors of the school, red and black. Those of Buenavista the orange and the black. The hymns of the schools were the following: Logo Candler College Logo Candler College 1 Hail Candler! Emblem for always of nobility and virtue Holy Mother of the soul you teach us the truth and rectitude. As a beacon that the sad sailor in the night will guide you are light that the path of the student with knowledge will illuminate.

Companions we sing the hymn of the beloved school in praise and its echoes resound gloriously like a psalm that reaches God. Chorus Academic structure Candler College Faculty Students at Candler College ca. 1955 Candler College consisted of four schools, each coordinated by a sub-director: * Elementary School, which included a pre-primary education degree and seven primary education grades (the latter was called preparatory). At the end of the sixth grade students could enter the Baccalaureate if they passed in any of the public secondary schools the official entrance exam that was required. * Baccalaureate school, high school in Spanish, which comprised five years. In the latter, students could choose between two branches: Science and Letters. The students left prepared to continue studies of higher education in the different careers that were offered in the country at the university level. * School of Commerce, consisting of two different branches: Accountant and Secretariat, which initially were programs of three years each. But from the course of 1957‚Äì58 Contador was extended to four years. Upon completion of studies in these programs, students were prepared to enter the world of work in commercial enterprises or where office work would be required. * High School in English, which consisted of four years of secondary education that prepared the student to continue studies of higher education in the United States. left Colegio Buenavista offered preschool (Kindergarten and Pre-primary) and primary education in Spanish and English from first to eighth grades. Her students continued secondary education at Candler College. The curriculum corresponded to the graduate school model adopted in Cuba at the beginning of the twentieth century, which implies the progressive nature of the teaching-learning process so that the contents of the subjects were sequenced progressively from pre- school to secondary education. Candler College and Buenavista followed the official programs for the Primary School and the Bachillerato proposed by the Cuban Ministry of Education, which determined in a precise way the contents for the subjects of each grade in the Study Plans, as well as the time required for each one. The teachers selected the textbooks and the materials among those prepared by authors Cubans. Primary Education in Spanish and the Baccalaureate had official recognition, as there were supervisors from the Ministry of Education who periodically visited the primary school classes. The Baccalaureate School was incorporated the Secondary Education Institute of Marianao, so that the students had to present exams of each subject before professors of this institute twice a year to obtain the accreditation of their results, and at the end, the diploma official that would allow them to enter the university. In the School of Commerce the professors prepared the study plans. The textbooks and materials were selected by them among those offered by the publishing houses and were available in the bookstores. The curricula for the High School followed the curriculum of the United States and the texts were brought from there. The schedules, the spaces and the didactic resources were conceived and managed in coordination by the sub-directors and teachers. They were autonomous to conduct the teaching-learning process. Each teacher was free to choose the teaching methods and teaching materials he or she considered most convenient for each subject and was responsible for the evaluation of the students, including the observation of their difficulties and needs in order to improve their performance. Grades or grades were reported monthly to the parents of the students. Religious education was important in both schools. The Bible classes were part of the curriculum in all grades. The students not only read the history and teachings of Jesus and the apostles in the New Testament, they also learned about the history of the Hebrew people, their leaders, prophets, and other characters; they also learned the Ten Commandments and read the Psalms and Proverbs in the Old Testament. Worshiping God and praying were part of the students' formation. Twice a week the students of Buenavista and the boys of Candler in the Chapel met separately, where the word of God was preached and topics related to spiritual, moral, civic and patriotic values were discussed.  Extracurricular activities  Students at both schools had opportunities to supplement their academic instruction through a number of sports and various extracurricular activities: = Sports = leftAthletics and sports were always practiced in Candler. In the beginning, the favorite sports were tennis and field and track. Later, students also practiced softball, basketball, volleyball, and judo. Some students could participate in teams that were specially trained to compete in the intercollegiate championships. Candler College won various trophies in baseball and basketball. They also played sports in Buenavista: softball, kickball, volleyball, and basketball. Teams were trained with the best players to also participate in intercollegiate competitions. = Music = In Buenavista there was a Music Department that, in addition to the regular music classes included in the curricula, offered piano and solfeggio and music theory lessons. The students could take these classes in their free time or at the end of the school day each day. The annual Recital was a tradition of many years, in which the students who took piano lessons played a piece of classical music. In this one also participated the Rhythmic Band. In the decades of 1940 and 1950, there was also a school band that participated in parades or patriotic celebrations and played the National Anthem during the salute to the flag. In addition, choirs were specially prepared to participate in festivals and other celebrations. Since 1958 a choir was organized with students from both schools. = Other extracurricular activities = Evening extracurricular activity at Colegio Buenavista. ca 1955 At different times, some groups of students interested in literature, musical appreciation, theater, oratory, or the publication of a newspaper were organized, guided by a teacher or counselor. The excursions were traditional opportunities to visit places near the school or historical or recreational places in different parts of the country. At Candler College, there was also a troop of Boy Scouts. In addition, festivals, bazaars, theatrical performances, Christmas celebrations and others that were part of the annual planning of school activities were organized.  Student body  Candler College and Colegio Buenavista were open to all children and young people without further requirements, who, apart from paying the monthly fee, committed to respecting their standards. Some students were scholarship two for the church and some parents got a reduction in the tuition for their children's education. The two schools did not admit exclusively Methodist or Protestant students. The majority of the students were Catholic and there were also some students Jews. Due to the good level in the teaching of the English language, Candler and Buenavista were chosen by many parents of students foreigners who lived in Cuba. In the sixty-two years of existence of Candler College and forty-one of Buenavista, many thousands of students left the schools prepared to continue their studies or enter the world of work and become good citizens. They were equipped with solid foundations of religious faith and moral values to cope with life after school. = Alumni Associations = The Candler Fraternity was the association of graduates and alumni of Candler College. The former students of Buenavista belonged to the Association of Former Students of Colegio Buenavista. Many alumni and teachers of Candler and Buenavista left their country in the early 1960s when the revolution that took power in 1959 turned to socialism. Others emigrated later. The majority went to live in the United States, concentrating on the largest number in Florida. Some of those who have been in contact have met on different occasions to remember the old times and reaffirm the spirit of the schools that they all share. The former students of Candler and Buenavista who remained in Cuba have formed the Candler-Buenavista Fraternity and meet annually since 1999.

It was released on CD and double LP in July 1989 on his own Deltic Records. It was Sensible's first album release in six years since 1983's The Power of Love. The album features contributions from Eddy Grant and former the Damned members Rat Scabies, Paul Gray and Henry Badowski, among others. The album was reissued in 2013 by Easy Action Records in a redesigned gatefold card sleeve.  Background  After leaving his previous record label A&M; following the release of his \\"Revolution Now\\" single in 1987, Sensible formed his own label, Deltic Records. His first release on the label was the single \\"Toys Take Over\\" in June 1988, followed by \\"I Get So Excited\\" in October. All three singles were included on Revolution Now, which was recorded in a number of different studios. Sensible wrote in the album's liner notes: \\"Why so many? Possibly due to the fact that being a bit of a perfectionist I spent a fair amount of time painstakingly putting this album together and would rapidly run out of credit wherever I happened to have the escalating bill that week - requiring frequent, and occasionally speedy relocation.\\" The album includes the 15 minute epic \\"Coward of Treason Cove\\", which consists of a montage of different songs and musical styles. It was co-written with former bandmate Henry Badowski during a visit to Sensible's home in December 1986. Badowski: \\"He was in the process of putting together a mini rock opera and I was given a bottle of whiskey and a pen and paper and was ordered to write the words to a bunch of tunes he'd written.\\" \\"Coward of Treason Cove\\" was originally released as the B-side to the \\"Revolution Now\\" 12\\" single.  Reception  Revolution Now received less favourable reviews upon release and did not chart in the UK. In a review for AllMusic, Richie Unterberger wrote that the album is hard to categorize musically, and that \\"the result sounds more irritatingly confusing than impressive.\\" He described the music as \\"'80s British dance rock, neo- psychedelia, and White-boy soul, sometimes in the same song\\". Unterberger added that \\"there are some nice bits of melody here and there, but you get the uneasy feeling that eclecticism is being used as a cover for the lack of killer material or a compelling lyrical thread.\\" In a more positive review, Ira Robbins of Trouser Press wrote that Sensible \\"reached some sort of artistic peak\\" on Revolution Now, although it was \\"hampered a bit by Sensible's minimalist singing and the obvious use of synthesizers where real instruments would have sounded better\\". He felt that the album was \\"full of catchy melodies and nearly serious left-field lyrics\\" and added that \\"there isn't a bad song here, and the best ones ... cover amazing stylistic ground with ease and flair.\\"  Track listing  Personnel  Credits adapted from the album's liner notes. ;Musicians *Captain Sensible - vocals, instruments *Rachel Bor - vocals (\\"Missing the Boat\\", \\"Toys Take Over\\") *Mark Ferda - instruments (\\"Toys Take Over\\", \\"I Get So Excited\\") *Belva Haney - vocals (\\"Green Light\\", \\"I Get So Excited\\") *Andy Boucher - keyboards (\\"Missing the Boat\\", \\"Wake Up (You're Only Dreaming)\\", \\"Green Light\\") *Eddy Grant - guitar (\\"I Get So Excited\\") *Rat Scabies - drums (\\"Riot on Eastbourne Pier\\") *Paul Gray - bass (\\"Riot on Eastbourne Pier\\") *Howard Turner - backing vocals (\\"Riot on Eastbourne Pier\\") *The Soultanas - backing vocals (\\"Revolution Now\\") *Captain Stupid - lead vocal (\\"Vosene\\") *Howlin' Wilf - harmonica (\\"The Kamikaze Millionaire\\") *Martin Newell - backing vocals (\\"The Kamikaze Millionaire\\") *Henry Badowski - vocals (\\"The Coward of Treason Cove\\") *Claire Gilligan - vocals (\\"The Coward of Treason Cove\\") *Fred Burns - voice (\\"The Coward of Treason Cove\\") ; Production *Captain Sensible - producer *Mark Ferda - producer (\\"Toys Take Over\\", \\" I Get So Excited\\") *Team Esselle - producer (\\"Missing the Boat\\", \\"Green Light\\") *The Flowerpot Men - producer (\\"Revolution Now\\")  References  1989 albums Captain Sensible albums Pop rock albums ","title":"Revolution Now"},{"id":"59019576","text":"The Leopaard CS9 or Liebao CS9 is a subcompact crossover produced by Changfeng Motor of GAC Group under the Leopaard brand.

Biography Burkards Dzenis was born in the outskirts of Riga and spent his first years in the city. He decided to become an artist because of the impression that two statues at the entrance to his school made on him, early in his life. In 1897 he moved to Saint Petersburg to study to become a sculptor at the Saint Petersburg Art and Industry Academy. There he came in contact with other young Latvian artists, including his own cousin and R≈´dolfs Pƒìrle, and joined the association of young artists known as R≈´ƒ∑is. He remained a member of the group until 1905. In Saint Petersburg he came in contact with a wider art scene and took influences from both the rich collections of the Hermitage Museum and through temporary exhibitions displaying contemporary art, among them the works of Auguste Rodin. Dzenis subsequently adopted a modern aesthetic and committed himself to the ideals of artistic renewal around the turn of the century. After having obtained his art diploma from the academy in 1905, he spend one year in Paris thanks to a scholarship, and subsequently traveled to Berlin and Moscow. He then returned to Riga where he opened a large and modern atelier and worked as an independent artist. He was also active as an art teacher. From 1910, he regularly exhibited his works at art exhibitions in the city, and took active part in the development of the city's artistic life. Dzenis became an influential member of the Art Academy of Latvia and was director of the Latvian National Museum of Art between 1920 and 1944. Following the Soviet occupation of Latvia, he fled the country to the United States. Dzenis, his wife, Augusta, and children emigrated to the United States as displaced persons in 1950.

It is one of the five largest Russian cognac producers.  History = Russian Empire = Viticulture and winemaking have been the main sectors of the economy of Kizlyar since the second half of the 18th century. A 1884, \\"On fruit and wine production\\", encouraged industrial production of cognac in Kizlyar. In the 1880s, Georgian businessman David Sarajishvili began producing alcohol Kizlyar; he was the first in the Russian Empire to produce cognac by keeping grape alcohol in Caucasian mountain oak barrels. Kizlyar first shipment - 236 buckets of grape alcohol to Moscow - in 1885. It was not until 1889 that Sarajishvili organized cognac production at Kizlyar. 1885 is regarded as the start of industrial cognac production in Russia. Production at the factory dropped following the prohibition of alcohol at outbreak of the First World War in 1914. = Soviet Union = Cognac made in 1954 Cognac production was reauthorized by the Soviet government in 1924, with full production only being restored just before the entry of the Soviet Union into the Second World War. In 1942, the factory was evacuated to Armenia to avoid the German advance; most of the alcohol was sent to the Tbilisi Cognac Factory. The factory relocated to Kizlyar in 1947. Restoration continued into the mid-1950s, with a new batch of cognac being produced in 1955 from 6-7 year old alcohol. Reconstruction and expansion of plant and employee accommodation to meet rising demand continued to 1960. In Soviet times, about half of the strong alcohol produced at the factory was exported, mainly to Western European countries. The factory produced grape juice instead of alcohol during the period of prohibition starting in 1985. The factory also required new suppliers due to the closure of Kizlyar and Tarumovsky district vineyards starting in 1985. = Russian Federation = The work of one of the production departments of the plant In 1990, the factory became a rental company \\"Dagvino\\". Due to the shortage of raw materials the company began to buy grapes in Spain or, in harvest years, in Krasnodar and Stavropol regions. In 1998, the factory received a French certificate that permitted to sell its products under the name \\"cognac\\", although earlier Kizlyar factory exported its drinks as a brandy. In 1998, during the Chechen‚ÄìRussian conflict, Vladimir Grigoriants, the director of the factory, and his wife were kidnapped and had been held in Chechen captivity for eight months. In 2008, Evgeny Druzhinin became the director of the factory. During his leadership, the company carried out modernization at its own expense and increased production volumes, becoming the main source of the Dagestan budget.. Also in 2008, the factory restored the status of the Kremlin Suppliers Guild On August 28, 2014, by order of the Prime Minister of Russia Dmitry Medvedev, the Kizlyar Brandy Factory was transferred to federal ownership and became a subject of Federal Service for Alcohol Market Regulation.

On September 1, 2015, the company was transformed into a joint-stock company.  Capacity rate  In 2008-2009, the factory management invested 15 million rubles in expanding the area of its own vineyards. During the financial crisis in 2009, the factory temporarily lost the status of the main enterprise of the region, giving way to the Derbent sparkling wine factory. At the end of 2012, the net profit of the factory amounted to about 1.5 billion rubles, and the factory itself got into the group of the three most profitable companies in the North Caucasus. At the end of 2015, the factory became the second largest enterprise in Dagestan with a total revenue of 2.4 billion rubles. At the end of 2018, the factory processed over 40 thousand tons of grapes.  Production  The factory produces cognacs of various aging times and grape vodka. In the 2010s, its brands included \\"Peter the Great\\", \\"Five Stars\\", \\"Three Stars\\", \\"Kizlyarsky Festive\\", \\"Russia\\", \\"Bagration\\", \\"Dagestan\\", \\"Kizlyar\\", \\"Lezginka\\", \\"Imperator Vserossijsky\\" and \\"Saradzhev\\".

It is the site of the Dutch Gap Conservation Area and Boat Landing and the Henricus Historical Park. Originally, Farrar's Island was formed by a meander loop in the James River and lay on the east side of the James River. At its smallest point, the neck of the peninsula was less than 400 feet wide. At that time, Farrar's Island was slightly less than 700 acres and lay about south of the James River fall line at Richmond, Virginia. Due to its strategic location on the river, the neck of the peninsula became the site of the earliest English settlements in Virginia, Henricus, was founded by Sir Thomas Dale in 1611. Farrar's Island acquired its name after 1637 when the Farrar family obtained ownership as fulfillment the headright due to William Farrar, an early settler who was councillor and commissioner of the Crown Colony of Virginia. The Farrar family owned the peninsula until 1737 when it was sold to Thomas Randolph. During the last year of the American Civil War, Farrar's Island played a minor role in the Bermuda Hundred campaign. The James River along the peninsula anchored the left flank of Union General Benjamin Butler's defensive line. At this time, Farrar's Island was the site of river defenses by both Union and Confederate to deny the use of the James River to the enemy. The James river around Farrar's Island was also the site of one of the last major naval engagements of the war, the Battle of Trent's Reach. During the war, Farrar's Island became a true island when General Butler's troops built the Dutch Gap Canal, across the neck of the peninsula. In the 1870s, the Dutch Gap Canal was expanded to become the main channel of the James River, which allowed shipping to bypass the meander loop around Farrar's Island. The construction of the canal put Farrar's Island on the west side of the James River and it evolved into its present form with a tidal lagoon surround by woods and wetlands. Colonial history Historical Marker, Farrar's Island In colonial history, Farrar's Island was technically a peninsula or a neck of land. However, in 17th century Virginia when the land was acquired by the Farrar family, a neck of land mainly surrounded by a river could also be known as an island. At its most narrow point, the neck was less than 200 yards wide and its elevation above the James River varied from 3 feet to about 49 feet. In the original patent that gave the land to William Farrar, the peninsula was called an island; though, the will of his son, his namesake, the land was called a neck. By the time of the American Civil War, the peninsula had acquired its common name of Farrar's Island. At the time of English-Native American contact period starting around 1607, the area around Farrar's Island was associated with the Arrohattoc, a tribe within the Powhatan Confederacy. The tribe's village of Arrohateck is depicted in John Smith and William Holes's map of 1607 Virginia as located approximately on the east side of the James River approximately 5 leagues (15 miles) south of the river's fall line. However, Arrohateck village was apparently deserted by the time the English began settling in the area. The first English settlement on Farrar's Island was Henricus, which was founded in 1611 by Sir Thomas Dale who the deputy-governor of the Virginia Colony. The settlement was located on the neck of the peninsula, which was near the location of the former village of Arrohateck. The founding of Henricus was commissioned by the Virginia Company of London, who ordered Dale to find a healthy location to secure the navigable portion of the upstream James River and to provide a place of retreat in case of an attack by the Spanish. Intending the new settlement to become the principal seat of the colony, Dale rapidly made Henricus a well-built, strongly-fortified settlement. Part of Henricus's fortifications included a ditch with a palisade behind that ran across the neck of the peninsula. The historian Robert Hunt Land suggests that it was at this time that the peninsula's neck got the name \\"Dale's Dutch Gap\\", as Dale had served as a long-time soldier of fortune with the United Provinces of the Netherlands. However, the settlement did not thrive. By the time Dale returned to England in 1616, Henricus was already in a dilapidated state, consisting of few houses and the ruins of a never- completed church. Though Henricus was incorporated into the City of Henrico, what was left of it was abandoned after the Powhatan attack of 1622, as the settlement was not listed as one of the fortified strongholds that the Virginia Company ordered survivors to move to. In 1637, Farrar's Island became the property of the son and namesake of the councillor, William Farrar. The peninsula was part of a 2000-acre patent along the James River granted by Governor John Harvey. Before he died, the elder William Farrar had acquired the acreage through headright for providing the cost of transporting 40 persons from England to the Virginia Colony. Farrar's Island remained with the Farrar family until it was sold to Thomas Randolph in 1727. In May 1771, heavy rains fell on the mountains to the west of Richmond for 12 days. These rains cause a deluge known as \\"The Great Fresh of 1771\\", which inundated the settlements and plantations along James River. Because it was almost entirely surrounded by the James, Farrar‚Äôs Island was particularly hard hit. All the property of the current owner, Thomas Mann Randolph was carried off by the flood, and the economic value of the land was also severely reduced as 80 acres of the peninsula's arable topsoil were washed away, leaving in its stead a pavement of stones. Civil War history By the time of the Civil War, Farrar's Island was owned by Henry Cox of Farmer's Rest, who had substantial landholding on the James River, and was sometimes referred to as Cox's Island 1864 depiction of Farrar's Island (on the right) with Union boom reaching to Trent's Reach (on distant left) 1864 Naval Scout drawing of James River and Farrar's Island with depiction of Confederate battery positions and Union boom across the James at Trent's Reach In May 1864, Union General Benjamin Butler's initiated the Bermuda Hundred campaign by landing the Army of the James at Bermuda Hundred and occupied the east side of the James River between Bermuda Hundred and Farrar's Island. After Butler gave up on his maneuver towards Richmond at his defeat at the Battle of Proctor's Creek, the Army of the James retreated back to a line on the Bermuda Hundred Peninsula stretching from a bluff on the south bank of the James river overlooking Farrar's Island, which was called Trent's Reach, to the mouth of the Appomattox River. The Confederates then entrenched their forces on the Howlett Line, which was approximately parallel to the Union defenses. These fortified lines were held with only minor changes until after the end of the Siege of Petersburg in April 1865. During this time, Farrar's Island became the front line in the struggle to control the James River. In June 1864, General Ulysses S. Grant ordered the Union navy under Admiral Samuel Phillips Lee to sink five ships, which were then used to create an obstruction boom across the James River stretching between Farrar's Island and Trent's Reach.The purpose of this barrier was to prevent Confederate warships from going downstream and attacking Grant's headquarter and depot during the Petersburg Campaign, which were located at City Point. The Confederates prevented Union warships from moving north by posting artillery batteries on the Howlett Line, as well as additional batteries on the east side of the James River north of Farrar's Island. These batteries provided a field of fire over almost all of the five- mile loop of the James that encircled Farrar's Island. To bypass the loop around Farrar's Island, General Butler began excavating a canal to cut across the neck of the peninsula at the Dutch Gap Canal. The work was begun in August 1864 and the canal completely cut the neck on January 1865. However, the explosion that removed the bulkhead at the north end of the canal to open it up threw so much debris and fallen earth into the canal that it was unusable by armed vessels, and dredging continued until the end of the war in April 1865. The completion of the canal made Farrar's Island a true island. Also in January 1865, the James River around Farrar's Island was became the site of one of the Civil War's last major naval battles, the Battle of Trent's Reach. In this battle, a Confederate flotilla of three ironclads and eight other warships were repulsed as they attempted to get through the Union boom between Farrar's Island and Trent's Reach. Post-Civil War history Soldiers of the 313th Field Artillery Regiment practicing at the Dutch Gap Artillery Range in 1918. Immediately after the Civil War, Dutch Gap Canal remained unusable because Henry Cox, who still owned Farrar's Island, had filled in the northern end of the canal with a causeway to access the island; however, a flood in 1870 washed away the causeway and opened the canal to development. Improvements to the canal were not made until after 1871, and ongoing deepening and widening under the guidance of the Army Corps of Engineers continued at least through to the end of the 1870s. The subsequent owner of Farrar's Island, Richard Friend, who inherited the property from Cox in 1888, filed suit against the United States Government to recover his claimed losses due to the improvement of the canal, but lost his case. In 1918, Farrar's Island became part of the Dutch Gap Range during World War I. The 80th Division's artillery regiments, who were stationed in Fort Lee, used the island for gunnery training before heading to France and fighting in the Meuse-Argonne offensive. Between 1920 and 1940, approximately 300 acres of Farrar Island was transformed into a tidal lagoon surrounded by wetland when the Richmond Sand and Gravel Company mined the area, creating a large pit that was subsequently connected to the old James River channel for barges to load the sand and gravel. In 1983, another 103 acres of Farrar's Island was transformed into an ash pond for the nearby Dominion Chesterfield Power Station located on the Dutch Gap Cutoff on the James River; though as of 2020, Dominion will be moving the coal ash from the pond on Farrar's Island to a lined landfill at the Chester Power Station. This transfer of coal ash is expected to take 15 to 20 years. Farrar's Island today Farrar's Island as it appears today Today, Farrar's Island is now part of the Dutch Gap Conservation Area and is the location of Henricus Historical Park. Farrar's Island has once more become a peninsula as a section of the old river on the north side of the island has been filled in over time. However, this peninsula now lays on the east bank of the James River.

On February 21, 2019, Texas Governor Greg Abbott nominated Busby to a vacancy on the Texas Supreme Court resulting from Justice Phil Johnson's retirement. Busby was unanimously confirmed by the Texas Senate on March 20 and sworn into office that same day.http://www.txcourts.gov/supreme/news/gov-abbott-swears-in-a-new-justice-j- brett-busby/  Biography  Busby received a Bachelor of Arts degree in public policy and international affairs from Duke University and his Juris Doctor from Columbia Law School. Before entering private practice, Busby served as a law clerk to Judge Gerald Bard Tjoflat of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, to retired Associate Justice Byron White of the Supreme Court of the United States, and to Associate Justice John Paul Stevens.  State court service  Before his appointment to the SCOTX in 2019, Busby served as a justice of the nine-member Fourteenth Court of Appeals in Houston from 2012 through December 31, 2018. The First and Fourteenth Court of Appeals are both housed in the 1910 Harris County Courthouse and divide the caseload of appeals from the ten surrounding counties, including Harris County, the State's most populous one. They hear both civil and criminal matters and each issue about 1,100 per year. Busby appreciated the variety of the caseload: ‚ÄúThere are very few generalists left in the law these days, but appellate judges are some of them. I really do enjoy that.‚Äù The Houston Courts of Appeals function as a stepping stone for service on the Texas Supreme Court. Supreme Court Justice Eva Guzman, like Busby, previously served as a member of the Fourteenth Court of Appeals. The Court's newest member, Jane Bland, comes to the SCOTX from the First Court of Appeals, with a very brief interlude as an appellate lawyer in private practice with Vinson & Elkins. Her predecessor, Jeff Brown, also hails from Houston, and had previously served on a Harris County district court bench, as did Bland and Guzman. Democratic challengers in Texas Supreme Court races typically also hail from Harris County. Busby ran for re-election in 2018, but was defeated by his Democratic opponent, as were all of the his Republican colleagues who were seeking re- election in Houston that year. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs certainly a dream job for me,‚Äù Busby is reported as commenting on his appointment, since the Supreme Court had been ‚Äúgrading my papers‚Äù during his six years as a state appellate judge. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very exciting to be able to join them.‚Äù Busby and Bland now have an opportunity to double-check the work of the new arrivals on the Houston Court of Appeals, though not in cases that were before them in 2018, from which they will have to stand recused. Busby is Board Certified in Civil Appellate Law by the Texas Board of Legal Specialization and served as Chair of the Appellate Section of the State Bar of Texas.

The term \\"particularly serious crime\\" was coined for the first time when the U.S. Congress enacted the Refugee Act in 1980. As of September 30, 1996, an aggravated felony conviction with at least 1 year of imprisonment that was actually imposed (or more than 2 years of imprisonment potentially imposed) by a court of law could qualify as a particularly serious crime in certain cases. This requires a case-by-case analysis. An offense that involves murder or torture is considered a particularly serious crime even if the possible term of imprisonment is 2 years or less. History The term \\"particularly serious crime\\" was created in 1980 during the enactment of Refugee Act,See generally Matter of N-A-M-, 24 I&N; Dec. 336 (BIA 2007). which allowed 50,000 international refugees to be firmly resettled in the United States each year.

This ridge was unevenly destroyed in abrasion, a process of grinding and erosion.  History The beach near the island is known as Rock Beach, after the tiny island opposite the beach. Until the breakwaters at the Rock Beach in Bat Yam were built in the late 1960s, the rock could only be reached swimming or sailing. Swimming there was and still is a common activity among bathers.

All six buildings center on a three-acre multilevel garden that has been described as the best of its kind in Washington, DC.  History  The Tilden Gardens units were originally planned in 1927, as cooperatives (co-ops). However, due to the collapse of the housing market, most of them were not completed until after the Great Depression. The four later buildings' apartments were rented out through the 1930s. In 1935-36 and again in 1939, one apartment was rented to then Senator Harry Truman and his wife. The first two Tilden Gardens buildings became legally separate cooperatives. By 1939, it became possible for owners to sell apartments again, and the later four buildings were incorporated as a single \\"Tilden Gardens\\" co-op.  Description  Counting all six buildings, Tilden Gardens has 210 apartments, of which 170 are in the \\"Tilden Gardens\\" co-op as such. The later buildings were modified to include fewer large apartments and more one-bedroom apartments, in recognition of Depression economics.

The film stars Silambarasan, Megha Akash and Catherine Tresa in the lead roles alongside Ramya Krishnan, Prabhu, Nassar, Mahat Raghavendra, and Yogi Babu, among others, in supporting roles. Hiphop Tamizha composes the film's music. This film is a remake of the Telugu film Attarintiki Daredi (2013) starring Pawan Kalyan and Samantha Akkineni. The title of the film is taken from a dialogue by Silambarasan in the film Chekka Chivantha Vaanam (2018).  Plot  Raghunandhan is a rich but unhappy businessman based in Madrid. He wishes to reconcile with his estranged daughter Nandhini, whom he expelled because she married Prakash against his wishes. His grandson Aadhi promises Raghunandan that he will bring her back to their home on his 80th birthday. Nandhini has two daughters: Maya and Priya. Aadhi enters the house as a driver named Raja who was appointed by Prakash after saving him from a heart attack. Raja tries to woo Priya but gives up when he learns that she is in love with another man. Maya hates Raja and is suspicious of him. Nandhini later reveals to Raja that she is aware of his real identity much before the incidents and warns him to abstain from doing anything with the intention of taking her back to Raghunandan. To save Priya's love, Raja and Bucket, Nandhini and Prakash's manager, go to a village, and accidentally, Maya falls into the jeep due to a head injury, thus suffering with amnesia. Raja introduces himself as her lover for the time being. Maya believes it. The trio goes to the venue. Raja and Bucket enter the house. They and the bridegroom escape from there and reach Nandhini's home after a violent altercation with the family members of the bridegroom where Maya's memory is revived. The bride's father Pandithurai asks for compensation for the damage caused by Raja, to which Nandhini promises Maya's marriage with Pandithurai's second son Saravanan. To avoid complications, Prakash fires Raja. Raja later learns that Maya loved him from the beginning but was hesitant to express her feelings. Azhagu, Pandithurai‚Äôs eldest son, falls for Maya, but his attempts are repeatedly thwarted by Raja. On the day of her marriage, Maya elopes with Raja. While waiting with him for the train to Coimbatore, Pandithurai's men reach the station to stop them, only to be trashed by Raja and his assistants, led by Roshan. Through Roshan, Maya comes to know Raja‚Äôs real motive. An angry Prakash, with Nandhini, arrives to shoot Raja, but Prakash is taken aback after knowing his true identity as Aadhi. Aadhi reveals that the day Nandhini left the house, Raghunandan tried to commit suicide but accidentally killed Aadhi‚Äôs mother. He says that he chose to love his grandfather, though he killed his mother. Nandhini chose to hate him, as he injured Prakash and expelled them. Nandhini and Prakash realise their folly and reconcile with Aadhi. Maya is kidnapped by four henchmen appointed by Azhagu, where she narrates the story to the henchmen. Aadhi and Bucket reach the spot, and Maya reconciles with Raja. Pandithurai is arrested. Raghunandan reconciles with Nandhini, and Aadhi is unanimously appointed as the CEO of the company thanks to Raghunandan and Nandhini's support. The film ends with Aadhi holding Raghunandan's hand with affection.

The region has some of the oldest rocks in the world and among the oldest in North America, formed from several sections of stable craton continental crust, including the Slave Craton, Rae Craton and Hearne Craton. These rocks form the Archean and Proterozoic Precambrian basement rock of the region and are the subject of extensive research to understand continental crust and tectonic conditions on the early Earth. Geologic History, Stratigraphy & Tectonics The Hearne Craton and Rae Craton are underlain by Archean metasedimentary and metavolcanic rocks. Quartz arenite in the Rae Craton has been interpreted as possible passive margin or rift deposits. Around the world, greenstone belts are a hallmark of ancient Precambrian rocks. The Ennadai-Rankin greenstone belt is the second largest in Canada and displays felsic volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks, as well as mafic rocks reaching greenschist grade on the sequence of metamorphic facies. Laminations in ironstone and pelite formations suggest that the mafic volcanic rocks deposited on the low energy slope of a volcanic plateau, away from wave action. Because of the enormous time distance from the Archean, exact interpretations are less reliable. In the late Proterozoic, the region was affected by the Wopmay orogeny. Along the edge of the Archean Slave Craton, a 1.1 kilometre thick wedge of carbonates formed the Rocknest Formation, which thins to the east. The Slave Craton (also known as the Slave Province) is smaller than the vast neighboring Superior Province, which extends southward to the Great Lakes. By contrast with the Superior Province, the Slave Province has more sedimentary rocks, more felsic than mafic rocks, more potassium-rich granite and gold and base-metal mineralization. Geologists have inferred ancient sea floor spreading in the western part of the province from dikes and mafic lava flows, overlain by deep ocean turbidite deposits. These rocks are believed to be the remains of oceanic crust that ended up preserved, surrounded on all sides by felsic volcanic rocks and granitoid plutons. In the area of Snofleld Lake in the northern part of the Slave Province, the remains of Archean stromatolites are preserved in a dolomite unit between felsic volcanic and greywacke-mudstone turbidites, some of the earliest evidence of life, forming in the shallows around volcanic islands. Around 1.27 billion years ago in the Proterozoic, a series of major magmatic events affected the region, referred to as \\"Mackenzie magmatic event,\\" by some geologists. In the Coppermine River Province, tholeiite flood basalts emplaced at the same time over a rapid span of five million years. Strontium-neodymium- lead analysis indicates that the rocks included older, partially melted basement rocks. In the Neoproterozoic, the four kilometre thick Mackenzie Mountains Supergroup deposited in a poorly understood basin. Hydrothermal fluids emplaced base metals into these deposits, likely during rifting that lasted into the Paleozoic. =Paleozoic (541-251 million years ago)= Marine deposition was common across much of the area in the Paleozoic. Within the Mackenzie Basin, tabulate and rugose corals grew formed the Horn Plateau Formation‚Äîa group of isolated reefs from the Devonian fed by nutrients from eroding Canadian Shield rocks and offshore upwelling in the ocean. The Selwyn Basin, which now spans into the Yukon Territory formed at the same time and accumulated graptolite fossils and bitumen. The siliclastic, fossiliferous wackestone and mudstone of the Ordovician Bad Cache Rapids Formation record a shallow shelf environment on Southampton Island. This unit is overlain by the Ashgill Boas River Formation carbonaceous mudstone and oil shale, Churchill River Formation coral-bearing wackestone and the Sixteen Mile Brook oil shale. =Mesozoic (251-66 million years ago)= In the Mesozoic, kimberlite pipes intruded Archean basement rock in places beginning around 75 million years ago and continuing into the Cenozoic in the Ekati area. Sedimentation continued in many areas into the Mesozoic. On Banks Island, manganese spherulites with rhodochrosite, iron-manganese oxides and dolomite mark the boundary between the Christopher and Kanguk sedimentary formations from the Cretaceous. =Cenozoic (66 million years ago-present)= In the early Cenozoic, changes in regional structural geology led to widespread erosion and fission track analysis of apatite indicates that in the Beaufort-Mackenzie area, rocks cooled from temperatures around 110 degrees Celsius after one mile of rock eroded above them in the early Eocene. The Northwest Territories was heavily glaciated during the Pleistocene. In the Mackenzie Mountains, moraine glacial till overlies older Paleogene gravel, paleosols and different till shed off of mountains. In the vicinity of the Mackenzie River delta and Sitidgi Lake till and sediments formed into the unglaciated Eskioma Lakes area. The Mackenzie delta formed as alluvium drowned valleys. Thermokarst and an ice-cored landscape took shape in the early Holocene. =Gas Hydrates= Northern Canada and the Northwest Territories are famous for gas hydrates, also known as methane clathrate‚Äîmethane gas frozen in thick sediments, which might hypothetically lead to intense climate change if they melted. Recognized from bore holes, gas flow during drilling or seismic data, it was not until March and April, 1993 that samples were recovered from a 451 meter deep hole in the Mackenzie Delta.

A. Leontovich, On the approximate boundary conditions for the electromagnetic field on the surface of well conducting bodies. Moscow: Academy of Sciences of USSR, 1948. Definition As originally formulated by Russian physicist Mikhail Leontovich, the boundary condition is given as :\\\\mathbf{E_t} = \\\\zeta_s \\\\mathbf{H_t}\\\\times \\\\hat{n}, where \\\\mathbf{E_t} and \\\\mathbf{H_t} represent the tangential components of the electric and magnetic fields, \\\\zeta_s = \\\\sqrt{\\\\mu/\\\\epsilon} is the effective surface impedance, and \\\\hat{n} is a unit normal pointing into the conducting material. This condition is accurate when the permittivity of the conductor is large, which is the case for most metals. More generally, for cases when the radii of curvature of the conducting surface is large with respect to the skin depth, the resulting fields on the interior can be well approximated by plane waves, thus giving rise to the Leontovitch condition. Applications The Leontovich boundary condition is useful in many scattering problems where one material is a metal with large (but finite) conductivity. As the condition provides a relationship between the electric and magnetic fields at the surface of the conductor, without knowledge of the fields within, the task of finding the total fields is considerably simplified.

Family Marjoribanks was the third son of Edward Marjoribanks of Hallyards and Lees, Berwick, and Grizel n√©e Stewart, daughter of Archibald Stewart of Edinburgh and Mitcham, Surrey; and the brother of Sir John Marjoribanks, 1st Baronet. He married twice, first to Eleanor, illegitimate daughter of Archibald Paxton, in 1798 and they had one son‚ÄîArchibald John Marjoribanks‚Äîbefore her death in 1799. In 1841, he married to Lucy, daughter of Edward Roger Pratt, and they had no children. Merchant By 1798, after presumably working for him, Marjoribanks was in partnership with Paxton as a wine merchant, marrying Eleanor in the same year. On Paxton's death in 1817, Marjoribanks continued his business in conjunction with Paxton's son, William Gill Paxton; Marjoribanks' elder brother, Campbell, joined as a director of the company in 1807, becoming a chairman three times. At some point, it appears Marjoribanks became involved in the work of the East India Company, pursuing this line by 1817 and becoming a shipowner for the company on a \\"considerable scale\\" later on. By 1832, he had withdrawn from the wine business, and by 1840, he is considered to have sold his majority stake in his East India agency. Political career By 1820, Marjoribanks was pursuing a political career. In that year's general election, he stood for Hythe and‚Äîwith the help of a non-existent opposition, money, and patronage of the East India Company‚Äîhe was \\"virtually impregnable\\". He declared independence from partisanship, however, stating to James Loch on the eve of the election that \\"I am not a Whig\\". Then, at the nomination, he was reported as declaring he: Marjoribanks' election was successful but, as a Member of Parliament, he began voting with the Whig opposition on most major issues, joining Brooks's Club in 1823‚Äîbut also voting with the Tories on issues including against the omission of arrears from the Duke of Clarence's grant in 1821. During this period he voted for Catholic emancipation, economy, retrenchment, and reduced taxation, as well as parliamentary reform‚Äîand was, in 1824, was described by James Abercromby as having \\"a very odd temper, which makes it difficult to deal with him\\". He was returned unopposed at the 1826 general election, during which he again professed his independence. After this, he voted against the Duke of Clarence's grant and for Catholic emancipation. he voted for chancery reform, the disenfranchisement of Penryn, and the repeal of the Test Acts. On most major divisions on retrenchment, he voted with the Whig opposition. By the 1830 general election, Marjoribanks was to all intents and purposes considered a Whig. He was returned for Hythe once more, alongside his cousin and chairman of the East India Company, John Loch, against opposition. After the election, he requested in an \\"anxious wish\\" from the Tory patronage secretary Joseph Planta for James Redsull to be made a Cinque Ports pilot. Planta noted: Marjoribanks' request was neither initially approved nor denied and a decision was made to consider this \\"at the proper time\\" as there was no appointment of pilots scheduled for that year. In the end, nothing came of the request. In the press, Marjoribanks was now considered a \\"Wellington Whig\\" despite Tory ministers considering him a foe. In this period of his parliamentary career, he voted in favour of parliamentary reform, and for inquiries into grievances of West Indian sugar producers. At the 1832 general election, Hythe was reduced to a single-member seat and Marjoribanks was again returned, opposed by a single Tory candidate. In the campaign, he expressed \\"cautious support\\" for the abolition of slavery, and described himself as \\"neither a republican, nor a radical\\". He held the seat until 1837, when he resigned by accepting the office of Steward of the Chiltern Hundreds, before standing unopposed for the seat again in 1841 and holding the seat until 1847 when he did not seek re-election.

Soon afterwards however he was forced to contend with the outbreak of civil war between al-Amin and his brother al-Ma'mun, and before long his continued loyalty to the former had put him at odds with a faction of the local jund led by al-Sari ibn al-Hakam, which favored recognizing al- Ma'mun as caliph instead. In the spring of 812 the jund, with the encouragement of al-Ma'mun, openly switched their allegiance and revolted, and Jabir was overthrown from his position.

She is generally considered to be the first Black-American woman to receive a PhD in astrophysics. She is also the first person to successfully work out the Penrose mechanism to extract energy from black holes. The Penrose mechanism uses Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity to extract energy from the ergosphere of a rotating black hole.  Early life and education  Williams was born in Memphis, Tennessee. She moved to Chicago at the age of 6 and studied at Malcolm X College, earning an A.A. in liberal arts in 1977 and being voted graduate student of the year. She studied astronomy at Northwestern University, earning a B.A. in 1980. She joined Indiana University Bloomington for her MA and PhD, achieving her doctorate in astrophysics in 1991.  Career  Williams was awarded a National Research Council postdoctoral minority fellowship and moved to the University of Florida in 1993. She joined Bennett College in 1998, winning the Belle Ringer Image Role Model Award, and acting as an Associate Professor of Astrophysics and Director, Center for Women and Science. Her work considered gravitomagnetism. She looked at the Penrose scattering process in the ergosphere of Kerr black holes. This formed a major part of her research, searching for the energy sources of active galactic nuclei. Williams was the first person to work out the Penrose mechanism of black holes. Her calculations explained that black hole jets are emitted as escaping tornado-like coils of photons and electrons - black holes drag spacetime into rotation near their cores, which may also produce uneven jets. She showed that the Lense-Thirring Effect could cause the high energies and luminosities. She became interested in gravitational instabilities and the form of dark matter in the early universe, but was unable to remain at the University of Florida after her postdoctoral fellowship ended. She also looked at how black holes could be used to power gamma-ray bursts. She struggled to get funding for her research when the University of Florida decided against supporting relativistic astrophysics research and did not extend her fellowship. Since 2009 she has been a research assistant professor at the University of Toledo. She was awarded a National Science Foundation grant to study the jet structure and energy generation of quasars and other active galactic nuclei. This study combines Monte Carlo simulations with the physics of general relativistic supermassive Kerr black holes. Having demonstrated that Kerr black holes can provide the energy of active galactic nuclei, she hopes to create a unified model showing that active galactic nuclei, microquasars, and gamma-ray bursts are powered by rotating black holes of different masses and/or accretion disk properties. She also works on dark energy and whether it could be a manifestation of gravity. Professor Williams is scheduled to give the plenary at the astrobiology conference, AbSciCon, in the fall of 2021, organized by American Geophysical Union and NASA.

History Mount McGillivray was named for Duncan McGillivray (1770-1808), one of the first white men along with David Thompson to see the Bow Valley. In November of 1800, McGillivray and Thompson rode south on a trip from the newly established fort at Rocky Mountain House and explored west into the Bow Valley as far as what is now Mount McGillivray in search of the headwaters of the Columbia River. tunnelsThe mountain's name was officially adopted in 1957 by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. During the Cold War, tunnels and vaults were constructed under the north slope of the mountain as part of a plan to safely store government documents, however the project was never completed. Geology Mount McGillivray is composed of sedimentary rock laid down during the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny.

It is located to the west of the district centre and the A435 Alcester Road. History The park and pool were originally part of the gardens of Moseley Hall, which were designed by the estate landscape gardener Humphry Repton. Towards the end of the 19th century most of the estate was being sold for house building; in particular, the construction of Salisbury Road in 1896 disconnected the park from the Hall. Businessmen bought the park and pool in order to prevent further development and preserve them for the citizens of Birmingham. The park was opened by local East Worcestershire MP Austen Chamberlain on 29 September 1899. In 1983, the park became part of the wider Moseley Conservation area. This seeks to preserve the historic character of the locality. In particular, the centre of the park contains a number of specimen trees. Amenities and events A music festival in the park The park has a tennis and yoga club, and hosts annual music festivals, including the Moseley Folk & Arts Festival, and Mostly Jazz. Ocean Colour Scene, who originate from the area, headlined a festival at the park in 2016 to celebrate the 20th anniversary of their album Moseley Shoals. An ice house in the park is Grade II listed. It was built in the 18th century and is around by . The ice house was used for cold storage and storing ice before the invention of the refrigerator. It is believed to have storage space for up to 20 tonnes of ice and food materials were placed above it to be used as frozen food. It is now open for public viewing. In 2015, the Sunday Times named the park as one of the desirable factors for Moseley being the best place to live in the UK, beating London‚Äôs Mayfair and Muswell Hill. Security A key is required to gain entry. Residents with keys have a say in the management, while the public may purchase a day key with a refundable deposit. The head ranger has said it has made the park popular as people feel safe inside it. An incident where a man was spotted armed with a knife in the park surprised the head ranger, who said that she hadn't heard of such a case in her 15 years of managing the site.

The game values a gentle use of natural resources and is used both as an entertainment and educational tool.  Plot  The game world in Eco is threatened with an impending meteor impact. The task of the players is to research and improve the level of technology available to them in order to destroy the meteor before it strikes without harming the game world too much by resource exploitation or pollution. The game world shares similarities to Earth. It is a small planet consisting of dirt, stone, and several other underground resources. It also features different biomes like forests, plains, and rivers, as well as several kinds of plants to harvest and animals to hunt.  Gameplay  Eco is a multiplayer survival game that allows players to interact with both the world and each other. The game pushes players to reenact a sustainable lifestyle. Players have to care about a balanced nutrition and need to control the gathering of natural resources, otherwise negatively harming or destroying the environment. For example, cutting too many trees reduces the amount of air pollution that can be mitigated, and creating too much pollution by using high tech machines can raise the sea level and species of plants or animals can become extinct if players harvest or hunt too much of them. In order to prevent this from happening players have to create a working society. They have the possibility to create currencies and establish an economy for trading, form a government and propose and vote on laws that can restrict what other players can do or give incentives to (not) do things by applying taxes or government grants to specific actions. Unlike other survival games, Eco does not have any combat between players or monsters, and there is no way for the player's character to die. It also encourages players to actively collaborate and work together with other players.  Production  Eco was originally an educational tool designed purely for pupils in middle school. Strange Loop Games cooperated with the University of Illinois on the creation of the game for some time. The U.S. Department of Education allocated more than a million dollars for the development of the project with its biggest boost delivered in 2015 of almost US$900,000 for a two year development contract. Strange Loop Games had previously only produced two games; the logic game Vessel and the serious game Sim Cell. The design of the game has been influenced by Open-world games like Minecraft and Rust, and has taken inspiration from the dynamic community processes present in EVE Online. In August 2015, the CEO of Strange Loop Games and designer of Eco, John Krajewski, attempted to gather $100,000 using the crowdfunding platform Kickstarter, in order to further extend the game. The campaign was successful, gathering more than $200,000. A release date September 2015 was targeted. It was eventually released in February 2018 as early access, in order to fund the ongoing development.  Reception  German computer game magazine GameStar titled Eco as an ‚Äúambitious survival game‚Ä≥ with an ‚Äúinnovative approach‚Ä≥. Rock, Paper, Shotgun described the game as a \\"good looking Minecraft\\", and emphasized that survival games usually promote a heedless exploitation of resources, while the players actions in Eco has consequences that need to be thought of.

Friedat made two requests in November 2016. She made a third request under Florida's Public Records Act (Government in the Sunshine Act) in March 2017. In June 2017, Canova and Friesdat made a joint request, but to no avail. That same month, Canova filed a lawsuit asking the courts to order Snipes to allow him to examine the ballots. On September 1, 2017, while litigation was ongoing, Snipes signed an order authorizing the destruction of 688 boxes containing the ballots. Litigation on the matter continued for another two weeks. On November 6, 2017, the court discovered that the ballots in question had been destroyed two months prior. The judge ruled that Snipes had illegally destroyed the ballots and that Canova be awarded attorney's fees. Snipes' attorney said a vendor had made and retained a digital copy of every ballot cast in the race and that the destruction of the ballots was neither intentional nor illegal. 2018 general elections Elections were held on November 6, 2018 for the Governor of the State, Florida's U.S. Senator, and all of Florida's U.S. Representatives, as well as other seats. Republican Ron DeSantis ran against Democrat Andrew Gillum, and was initially declared the winner. On November 17, Gillum conceded to DeSantis after the final recount, making DeSantis Governor- elect. Florida's governor Rick Scott ran against incumbent Democratic Senator Bill Nelson for the U.S. Senate seat. Nelson eventually conceded to Scott after the recount. During the August 2018 primary elections, a public polling location was moved inside a gated community. Voters complained that they were required to show their ID to security guards to get through the gates, despite the fact that ID is not required to vote in Florida. Voters were questioned, and some turned away. Complaints were lodged with Snipes' office at the time of the primary elections, but the situation was not resolved before the general elections. Snipes' assistant told a reporter that she (the assistant) was not aware of any complaints. The Thursday following the election, a teacher found a box marked \\"provisional ballots\\" that had been left at a school used as a polling place. The teacher reported finding the box, but did not touch it or look inside. A county official later said the box contained voting equipment, not ballots. The Friday after the elections, the Canvassing Board found that the 205 provisional ballots were already counted. The Board also determined that 20 of the ballots were illegal due to mismatched signatures, however, since the votes were already processed, the illegal votes could not be distinguished from the legal votes and all 205 votes remained counted. Florida law states that county election departments must release the total number of ballots counted within 30 minutes of poll closings to facilitate accountability and oversight. Six days after the election, the total number of ballots had not been reported. The Election Department is also expected to post the current tallies every 45 minutes after the polls close. By the Friday after the election, there was still no declared winner in the U.S. Senate race and votes were still being counted. As more votes were counted, they seemed to favor the Democratic nominee. Scott filed suit the Friday after the election, claiming that Broward County was violating the law. The judge ruled in Scott's favor, ordering Snipes to disclose the number of ballots cast in Tuesday‚Äôs midterm elections, broken down by absentee, early, and election day votes, as well as the number of ballots still to be counted by 7:00 p.m. that day. Snipes did not comply. Florida requires an automatic machine recount when results are within 0.5%. By the weekend following the election, the tallies in the U.S. Senate race were so close that a machine recount was initiated. After the election, current Governor and then U.S. Senate candidate Rick Scott asked the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to investigate. Scott asked for the investigation verbally. Because there was no formal written request filed, no investigation was initiated. On November 18, 2018, almost two weeks after election day, Scott was declared the winner, officially becoming Senator-elect after Bill Nelson's concession. Removal from office On November 18, 2018, Snipes submitted her resignation, to be effective January 4, 2019, after Senator Bill Nelson conceded the Senate race the day before. Florida Governor Rick Scott suspended Snipes on November 30, 2018. Peter Antonacci, president and CEO of the state‚Äôs business-recruitment agency Enterprise Florida, was appointed to serve the remainder of Snipes‚Äô term until a replacement can be chosen by voters in November 2020.

Online resource accessed 4 April 2020.  The History  The first St Stephen's was a simple temporary building (‚Äôiron church‚Äô) put up in 1901 as a chapel of ease to All Saints Church in Edmonton. In 1906 work began on a permanent church to a gothic design by John Samuel Alder (1847-1919) with walls built of Stamford stone, with Welden stone for the corners. Bath stone is used for the windows and pillars and York stone for the steps. The church was lit by electricity. The chancel, lady chapel, organ bay, clergy and choir vestries and three bays of the nave and aisles were completed in 1907 at a cost of ¬£6,000, and consecrated that year by the Bishop of London. In 1909 St Stephen's became a separate parish. Completion of the church, which in 1912 was estimated to cost a further ¬£4,800, was achieved in 1916, but the planned- for tower and spire were never built.‚ÄôSt Stephen's Church‚Äô. ‚Äò‚ÄôThe Enfield Society‚Äô‚Äô.

The nave and chancel are of lofty proportions, with traceried clerestory windows, and an opened timbered and panelled roof of arched form; and there are handsome arcades with stone pillars and richly moulded arches, dividing the nave and chancel from the aisles and lady chapel. Large traceried windows are a feature at east and west ends of the church. At present only the lower stage of the tower has been built, up to the height of clerestory window-sills; but, when completed, the tower and spire, rising to a height of 170ft will be an important feature, and a landmark for many miles round. The general style of the church is Decorated Gothic [...] the walls throughout, inside and out, are faced with Casterton free stone, roughly chiselled.

The Pipe Organ  The parish's first pipe organ (1-manual and pedal) was built for the temporary church building by the firm of Henry Jones. It was later moved to the church of St Alphege Edmonton. The present 3-manual instrument was installed in 1908, built by the Norwich-based firm of Norman and Beard. As a mark of the importance of the St Stephen's organ to the nation's heritage, being of special interest and warranting every effort to preserve, it has been awarded an Historic Organ Certificate by the British Institute of Organ Studies, the amenity society for the British organ, which lobbies Government, Historic England and other national bodies.St Stepehn's Church, as listed in The National Pipe Organ Register The original cost of the present instrument was ¬£1,150.

He was a co-developer of the RDS-37 (the Soviet Union's first two-stage thermonuclear device) and worked on statistical mechanics, plasmas and nuclear reactors. Career Klimov was a student of Nikolay Bogolyubov at the Academy Institute for Chemical Physics. He worked as a laboratory assistant there, along with Dmitry Shirkov. Director Nikolay Semyonov assented to Bogolyubov's suggestion that they be employed as full-time workers. Klimov worked in a single, secure room with his colleagues. In March 1950, he and other researchers were given short notice to move, again under tight security, to what was known as KB-11 ('Design Bureau-11') or Arzamas-16, the closed city of Sarov, Nizhny Novgorod Oblast (today it is the All-Russian Scientific Research Institute of Experimental Physics (VNIIEF)). The purpose was to develop the Soviet hydrogen bomb. He was involved in calculations including for many-layered nuclear systems and neutron moderation. Klimov, Shirkov, Vasily Vladimirov, I.–ê. Zhernak and –ê.–ê. Bunatyan developed mathematical approaches to tasks involving neutron propagation and thermalisation. In another team of Bogolyubov's, with Dmitry Zubarev and Yuri Tserkovnikov, he investigated magnetic thermonuclear reactor design, studied the behaviour and stability of plasma contained in a magnetic field and the interaction between the plasma and the reactor vessel wall. With Zubarev, he wrote a number of papers on plasma physics, developed the theory of temperature jumps at the plasma boundary in a magnetic field, and wrote on stationary conditions in a magnetic thermonuclear reactor. Klimov did not get on well with Bogolyubov (who had a more fruitful professional relationship with both Shirkov and Zubarev), and once Bogolyubov was given permission to leave \\"the Installation\\", Andrei Sakharov took Klimov into his group. The RDS-6 bomb, Sakharov's 'layer cake' design on which Klimov had done a part of the theoretical work, was tested in 1953. Klimov was one of the fifteen authors of the design report detailing the configuration and calculations for the RDS-6's successor, the first Soviet two-stage nuclear device, the RDS-37.  Personality  Klimov regularly ridiculed perceived lies in press reports. He was regarded as a pioneer of different thinking by some, supporting people's rights, and was openly defiant, to the surprise and dismay of his colleagues who considered such behaviour perilous. He was often called to the gorkom (political committee) to receive warnings. At KB-11, Klimov quickly became the outdoor activities leader in the group in swimming, walking, running at the local stadium and any other athletic pursuits. He was killed before his thirtieth year in a snow avalanche in the Caucusus mountains.

Extensive tectonic changes, metamorphism and volcanic activity have formed the region throughout Earth history. Newfoundland In contrast to neighboring Labrador, the island of Newfoundland is largely underlain by younger rocks. The Churchill, Nain, Superior and Grenville Province present in Labrador were all small continents or pieces of continental lithosphere that joined to form sections of the proto-North American continent Laurentia and the broad stable region known as the Canadian Shield. By the end of the Precambrian in the Neoproterozoic, continental crust which had come into existence in the Archean nearly 2.5 billion years had already experienced up to eight supercontinent cycles. In the late Precambrian and Paleozoic, Avalonia (named after the Avalon Peninsula in Newfoundland) formed as a volcanic island arc off the coast of the supercontinents Pannotia which lost land through rifting and became Gondwana. This volcanic island arc was later split into different areas, but currently underlies southern New England, Maine, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, southern New Brunswick, southern Ireland, England, Wales, Belgium, the Netherlands and much of north Germany. Northwest Newfoundland includes older rocks affected by the Grenville orogeny in the late Proterozoic during the collision of continents to form the previous supercontinent Rodinia. Examples of ancient rocks from this period include the late Precambrian Harbour Main Group ignimbrite and ash flow tuff with obsidian and augite in the center of the Avalon Peninsula. Rocks of similar age were forming on Grenville Province basement rock in what would become western Newfoundland, such as the Round Pond granite formed 602 million years ago. Sedimentary and volcanic rocks 15 kilometers thick are exposed in the Avalon Peninsula, deposited in rift basins as flysch and molasse with volcaniclastic rocks in submarine fans. The Gaskiers Formation holds diamictite that may have formed during the Snowball Earth glaciations and Ediacaran fossils and microfossils have been found in some rocks. Northern Newfoundland at the edge of the Laurentian continent witnessed columnar flood basalts in the Cloud Hills area into the Cambrian. The Avalon Zone is an area of 550 million year old sedimentary and volcanic rocks exposed only in the east that preserves the original geology of the microcontinent and extends 600 kilometers out to sea forming the below water Flemish Cap. By the early Devonian, the Avalonia microcontinent and the Bronson Hill island arc, collided with Laurentia to form the mid-sized continent Euramerica, causing the Taconic orogeny. The collision closed the Iapetus Ocean and obducted the Laurentian continental margin under the two island arcs. The process produced a strange bulged up area of mantle material to the surface as peridotite in Gros Morne National Park, essentially the only area on the Earth's surface where mantle material is present as cool, crystallized rock. It also created an ophiolite zone where oceanic crust was preserved on land. Geologists group the rocks in this area into the Humber Zone and the Dunnage Zone, with the Dunnage Zone's southern edge defined by the Gander River Ultrabasic Belt. The neighboring Gander Zone has siltstone, shale and quartz sandstone as well as deformed rocks and granite. The sediments were deposited on the continental margin during the closure of the Iapetus Ocean. By 356 million years ago, Gondwana collided with Euramerica, closing the Rheic Ocean and creating the supercontinent Pangea, which left Newfoundland and the Avalonian microcontinent (also known as terrane) far inland and brought widespread interior desert conditions around the world. Newfoundland was re-exposed to the ocean in the Triassic when rifting began to form new oceanic crust and opened the Atlantic Ocean. Labrador Labrador is part of the eastern Canadian Shield and intrusive igneous or metamorphic rocks are the most common, with sedimentary rocks in some areas. Four of the seven Canadian Shield provinces make up Labrador. Archean age rocks and east-west structural trends mark the Superior Province (a small area in the west near Quebec) which encompasses the Ashuanipi Complex granulite and granodiorite intruded by pyroxene-rich felsic plutons. The Nain Province runs along the northeast coast and also has Archean-age rocks, although a greater northward trend. The only exception is gneiss overlain by metasedimentary and metavolcanic rocks in the southeast, which were recrystallized and metamorphosed during 1.42 billion year old orogeny. A major anorthosite- adamellite pluton intrudes the province. South of the Davis Inlet, the Hopedale Gneiss is the defining rock unit. Nain Archean gneiss is overlain to the north of the community of Nain, Newfoundland and Labrador by the undeformed Ramah Group shale, sandstone and quartzite from the Aphebian. The Mugford Group tholeiite basalts and pyroclastic flows overlie similar sedimentary rocks. The volcanic rocks are between 1.49 and 2.3 billion years old. The Nain Province is subdivided into the Makkovik-subprovince, which is mainly made up of the 25,000 foot thick Aillik Group quartzofeldspathic, argillite, limestone, conglomerate, paragneiss and iron formations. The Churchill Province is situated inland in north-central Labrador and was deformed during the Hudsonian orogeny. Anorthosite intrusions partly obscure it in places, but a mylonite zone marks it northern boundary. Structural geologists divide it into the undeformed sedimentary and volcanic rocks Kaniapiskau Supergroup in the Labrador Trough (including gabbro sills and plutons) in the west and high-grade anorthosite and gneiss in the east. Virtually all of southern Labrador belongs to the major Grenville Province, which underlies much of eastern Canada and the northern US. Extensive faulting and mylonite marks its northern boundary with the other structural provinces. Archean gneisses were metamorphosed again during the Grenville orogeny and intruded by anorthosite-adamellite plutons. The Kaniapiskau Supergroup extends into the Grenville Province, marked by marble and quartzite. During the Paleozoic around 334 million years ago, flood basalts emplaced in northern Newfoundland and southern Labrador. Through the Mesozoic and into the Cenozoic, the landscape eroded, shedding sand into the Labrador Shelf, mainly from older metasediments and metavolcanic rocks that reached amphibolite grade on the sequence of metamorphic facies. Close to Makkovik, breccia from the Mesozoic, cut by lamprophyre-carbonatite dikes marks the opening of the Labrador Sea. The region experienced repeat glaciations during the Pleistocene. Glaciomarine silts and mud records the melting of the glaciers on the Labrador Shelf, with significant deposition around 20,000 years ago. Analysis suggests most of these sediments originated on land in Labrador, although large amounts of limestone (which is completely absent in the Labrador) indicate a second source to the north, likely Paleozoic limestone on the Hudson Strait and Ungava Bay. =Natural resource geology of Labrador= Massive iron deposits are found in the Labrador Trough along with copper, uranium and molybdenum. Iron forms in chert from the Ungava Bay to the Grenville Front, over a span of 700 miles, while copper and nickel minerals such as pyrite, pyrrhotite, sphalerite and galena form dispersed deposits or massive bodies in Kaniapiskau Supergroup rocks. The Aillik Group hosts uranium as uraninite and pitchblende dispersed in veins in pegmatite, argillite, granulite and quartzite.

Approximately 1,500 texts and fragments have been found to date. The texts were written in the 13th and 12th centuries BCE. The most famous of the Ugarit texts are the approximately fifty epic poems; the three major literary texts are the Baal Cycle, the Legend of Keret, and the Tale of Aqhat. The other texts include 150 tablets describing the Ugaritic cult and rituals, 100 letters of correspondence, a very small number of legal texts (Akkadian is considered to have been the contemporary language of law), and hundreds of administrative or economic texts. Unique among the Ugarit texts are the earliest known abecedaries, lists of letters in alphabetic cuneiform, where not only the canonical order of Phoenician script is evidenced, but also the traditional names for letters of the alphabet.

The most famous of the Ugarit texts are the approximately fifty epic poems. The most important literary document recovered from Ugarit is arguably the Baal Cycle, describing the basis for the religion and cult of the Canaanite Baal; the two other particularly well known texts are the Legend of Keret and the Tale of Aqhat. The other texts include 150 tablets describing the Ugaritic cult and rituals, 100 letters of correspondence, a very small number of legal texts (Akkadian is considered to have been the contemporary language of law), and hundreds of administrative or economic texts. The tablets have been used by scholars of the Hebrew Bible to clarify Biblical Hebrew texts and have revealed ways in which the cultures of ancient Israel and Judah found parallels in the neighboring cultures. The tablets reveal parallels with Israelite practices described in the Bible; for example, Levirate marriage, giving the eldest son a larger share of the inheritance, and redemption of the first-born son were practices common to the people of Ugarit as well.

Ascyreia.  Distribution and Habitat  The species is present from northern Pakistan east to central Nepal through the western Himalayas in hilly regions at elevations of 800-1200 meters above sea level. It is found in open areas or shady, moist places, sometimes being found in the undergrowth.  Description  The species is a shrub that grows from 50-120 centimeters tall. It is many-branched, and its branches are spreading or drooping or sometimes straggling. Its stems are red, 4-lined, and ancipitous when young, but later become terete. The stems are 15-50 mm long, meaning they are almost always shorter than the leaves. When the plant has bark it is a dark grey color. The leaves are sessile and are elliptical to oblong and are paler beneath the leaf. The lower ones are eventually deciduous. The leaves have laminar glands that are arrayed in short lines or streaks or dots, and their ventral glands can be dense or sparse varying from plant to plant. The species has groups of 1-3 flowers that come from an apical node and are corymbiform. The flowers are 35-65 millimeters in diameter and are stellate with ovoid buds that are obtuse to rounded. The petals appear bright yellow to bright yellow-orange and grow to be around 20 by 15 millimeters in size. The stamen fascicles each have about 30 stamens, with the longest being 15-20 millimeters long with yellow anthers. The seeds are a dark reddish-brown and are 1-1.2 millimeters long. The species' flowering period typically lasts from March to August.  Uses  Hypericum oblongifolium extract has traditionally been used as a treatment for numerous ailments, including hepatitis, gastric ulcers, and bee stings. In addition, its extract has also been used as a dressing for external wounds and as a sedative, antispasmodic, and antiseptic. More recently, methanol extracts from H. oblongifolium have been tested for their analgesic properties, with the raw extract from the plant being proven to have significant analgesic properties. However, no widespread usage of the plant strictly as an analgesic has yet been recorded. Besides its medical uses, the extract that comes from the roots of the species can be used to create a yellow dye that is sometimes harvested in local regions where the species can be found.

In his early career, he was the owner and operator of a specialty drum shop in the West End of London. Later, Arbiter founded or co-founded several instrument companies, including Arbiter‚ÄìWestern, Dallas‚ÄìArbiter and CBS‚ÄìArbiter. He is credited with designing the Beatles' original drop-t logo, and bringing karaoke to Great Britain. Early career Arbiter began his career by opening Drum City, a drum speciality shop, on Shaftesbury Avenue in London. In the late 1950s, his shop quickly became a regular hangout for jazz drummers. Soon after, Arbiter became the UK franchise for Fender guitars and introduced the first Fender Stratocaster to Britain. Beatles logo Ringo playing on Arbiter's kit in Belfast, 1964 In the early 1960s, Arbiter secured exclusive rights to sell Ludwig drums. Ringo Starr, interested in a Black Oyster Pearl drum kit, then only available through Ludwig, approached Arbiter in early 1963. Starr insisted that a large Ludwig logo be printed on the bass drum head, which was not available. Brian Epstein suggested that the drum head also include a Beatles logo, and Arbiter decided on a design including a large Beatles logo with enough room to fit a Ludwig logo on the top. He sketched a logo mockup on the back of a cigarette package and paid a local signmaker five pounds to paint the logo on the drum head. Other ventures Arbiter continued to find success in the music market, selling equipment to musicians including Brian Bennett, Jeff Beck, and Jimi Hendrix. In 1966, Arbiter established a new guitar company, Arbiter‚ÄìWestern, which was sold to Dallas in 1969. Arbiter became the company's deputy chairman and the company was renamed Dallas‚ÄìArbiter. While there, Arbiter's work included launching a new line of Hayman drums, considered the loudest on the market In 1974, Arbiter left Dallas‚ÄìArbiter and began a new venture, CBS‚ÄìArbiter. Arbiter introduced Autotune in 1975, which allowed drums to be quickly replaced and retensioned. In the late 1980s, while visiting Japan, Arbiter discovered karaoke and began importing and manufacturing karaoke machines. In 2001, Arbiter received a lifetime achievement award from the Music Industries Association. Arbiter retired in 2003 and died in London in 2005 after a battle with cancer.

She received her bachelor's degree from Dayacician College in Calcutta and later enrolled to study Medicine at Christian Medical College in Vellore. She was elected to the Berhampur constituency in 1937 and 1946 and served as the Deputy Speaker of the Odisha Legislative Assembly in 1946. She notably introduced a policy of free education for girls in Odisha.  Early life, education and married life  Laxmibai was born on 12 October 1899 in Berhampur, India to Varahagiri Venkata Jogesh (father) and Varahagiri Sovama (mother). She was the younger sister of future Indian President V. V. Giri. Laxmibai completed her secondary education in Berhampur and later joined the Theosophical Society in Kashi. She was a graduate from Dayacician College in Calcutta and went on to study medicine at Christian Medical College in Vellore. Ill health prevented her from completing medical studies, and she eventually returned to Berhampur. After her return, she was married to Adruti Venkateswar Rao of Rajahmundry. Her husband died within one year of their marriage and she returned to her parents' house in Berhampur.  Participation in Indian freedom movement  After the death of her husband, Laxmibai was inspired by Mahatma Gandhi and participated in the Indian freedom movement, in which many of her family members were already involved. National leaders like Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, and Rajendra Prasad stayed at Giri's residence during their visits to the Berhampur district. She participated in activities such as boycotting foreign goods and picketing in front of liquor shops. Her participation in these activities led to her first arrest on 18 January 1932. The Chhatrapur Court sentenced her to one year imprisonment and a fine of 700 Indian rupees. She was later transferred to Vellore Central Prison and served one and a half years in prison. In 1935, she served as the President for Ryots Mahasabha in Kulada, Ganjam. She was a prominent activist in the Khadi Movement and distributed khadis free of charge to the poor. She was also an active participant in the Quit India Movement of 1942. When India achieved independence, she was serving a sentence at a jail in Cuttack, where many notable freedom fighters were imprisoned during the swaraj movement. A memorial to freedom fighters was inaugurated at the jail site by Honorable Chief Minister of Odisha Naveen Patnaik on 23 January 2010, but the development appears to have stalled.  Later involvement in politics  Laxmibai served as an active member of the Indian National Congress in Odisha from 1930 to 1940. She took the roles of the Vice-President of the Ganjam district, the Congress Committee, and President of Berhampur town Congress. Laxmibai was elected to the Odisha Assembly without any opposition from the Brahmapur Assembly Constituency in the first general elections of 1937, and continued as MLA consecutively until 1953. From 29 May 1946 to 20 February 1952 Laxmibai held the positions of Deputy Speaker and Speaker of the Odisha Legislative Assembly. = Women's empowerment = Laxmibai critically appraised the education policy presented at the Deputy Speaker's national conference in Kerala. She introduced a free education policy for girls in Odisha as part of her interest in empowering women. The policy improved the performance of girl students in the area. In Odisha, she served as the President of the Kasturba Memorial Fund's local branch as an adviser for the Government Girls High School Committee and she was a member in the State Social Welfare Board. She also visited Ganjam district, Boudh district, and Phulbani district to help poor students and she gave aid to girl students in the Jaya Mangalam Ashram.

It is estimated that more than three million men fought in the battle, and more than one million men were wounded or killed, making it one of the bloodiest battles in human history. The work comprises 72,396 small human figurines, each separately wrapped in a calico shroud which was cut and sewn by hand. The full installation was laid out at the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park from 8 to 18 November 2018, over the centenary of the Armistice of 11 November 1918 that ended the First World War. Background Heard started the work after suffering injuries to his hands in a car accident in 2013 which prevented him continuing with his earlier artworks. He was inspired by injured British servicemen returning from Afghanistan, and the difficulty to envision the 19,240 Commonwealth soldiers killed on the first day of the Battle of the Somme, on 1 July 1916. The shrouded figures draw in part from the films of Ridley Scott, and presents a tangible three dimensional representation of each dead soldier and of the scale of the casualties. Determined to make each figure an individual, each shroud covers a plastic figurine approximately long (approximately 1:6 scale); the figurines are jointed so each can take its own slightly different position. The calico shrouds are cut by hand, wrapped around the figure, and then sewn up and tied on. As he worked, Heard crossed off a name from the official list of the missing for each shrouded figure he completed, creating a relationship between that figure and a specific person. Heard built a shed in his garden in Somerset to assemble and store the shrouded figures. He received early financial support from songwriter Steve Knightley, Exeter City Council, and the Exeter Chiefs Foundation. After completing and exhibiting 19,240 shrouded figures, Heard resolved to expand the work by adding another 60,000 figures to represent all 72,396 Commonwealth soldiers missing during the 5 months of the Battle of the Somme, from 1 July and 18 November 1916. He aimed to complete the work for the centenary of the Armistice of 11 November 1918 that ended the First World War. Heard's work was supported by a team including Shrouds of the Somme committee chairman Commodore Jake Moores, project director Mel Bradley, and (from June 2017) project patron Jim Carter. Completing the work took approximately 13,000 hours, working almost continuously on this project over the five years from 2013 to the centenary of the end of the First World War in 2018, finishing only days before the completed work went on display in London. Support was received from a number of organisations, including VolkerFitzpatrick, DHL, West Ham United F.C., Westfield Group, Network Rail, Transport for London and Waitrose. Exhibition An assemblage of 19,240 shrouded figures was laid out by soldiers from the 6th battalion of The Rifles and exhibited in Exeter for the centenary of the Battle of the Somme in July 2016, attracting over 60,000 visitors. The assemblage was then exhibited in Bristol for Remembrance Sunday, in November 2016. The extended work was laid out as \\"The Trench\\" in Exeter in June 2018, with approaching 72,000 models stacked in high wooden frames to create a replica trench about long that the public could walk through. The names of the missing were listed on the outside of the frames. After displays in Salisbury, Exeter, Belfast, Bristol in the UK, and at Thiepval in France, the full installation was laid out at the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, in Stratford, East London, in November 2018, with all 72,396 models placed on a lawn in strictly regimented rows by volunteers from the 1st battalion, Royal Anglian Regiment. The shrouds took three days to put in place, covering an area of on the South Park Lawn near the ArcelorMittal Orbit. It was described by the historian Dan Snow as \\"the most remarkable First World War commemoration you will ever see\\". Displayed alongside the main installation was \\"Lost Lives\\", a separate display of 1,561 shrouds, one for each day of the First World War, with each shrouded figure accompanied by a cross listing the number of Commonwealth war casualties on that day. Posters with copies of the official list of the missing were displayed nearby. During the exhibition, volunteers recited names from the list. The installation went on public display from Thursday 8 to Sunday 18 November, with free entry. A memorial service was held on Sunday 11 November 2018, led by Reverend Canon Flora Winfield. The exhibition was visited by Anne, Princess Royal on Thursday 15 November. Donations were collected for SSAFA - the Armed Forces charity, and the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. The models will be sold for ¬£35 each, with proceeds also donated to those two charities.

She was believed to have traveled from her job at a Best Buy store on Harrison Street via a Municipal Railway Vehicle on the Third Street Corridor around 9:45 pm, wearing a blue Best Buy shirt. Her daughter Arianna, was last seen in late February in Oakland, California. On April 8, a gardener in the John McLaren Park discovered a large piece of wood resting behind a clump of ivy covered bushes with an odd silver character painted on it.

He was suspended from the Labour Party and the NEC in May 2019, pending investigation, after publicity over making allegedly antisemitic comments.  Early life and career Willsman was born in Andover in 1944. He worked for the National Union of Public Employees as a researcher. Political activism As a delegate representing Canterbury's constituency party to Labour's 1976 conference, Willsman unsuccessfully moved a resolution to make comprehensive education compulsory by 1977, rather than maintaining a system with grammar schools and independent schools. From the 1970s, Willsman has been a central member of the Campaign for Labour Party Democracy, a left-wing group that campaigns for more power to be given to party members, and is its secretary. Every year between 1981 and 1994, Willsman was elected onto the Labour Party's Conference Arrangements Committee. He was described as one of the left wing of the party's \\"key strategists\\" in 1981, having focused on party constitutional issues rather than ideological issues. In his time on this committee, Willsman had a reputation for his expertise on process. Having lost his seat on this committee in 1994, he was elected to the party's disciplinary National Constitutional Committee in 1995. Willsman has been a long-term, though intermittent, member of Labour's ruling body, the National Executive Committee (NEC). He was first elected in 1998 on a Grassroots Alliance slate. Having failed to win a seat in 2014, Willsman was elected with Momentum support in 2016, coming sixth in the section representing members. For the 2018 elections to the NEC, Willsman was included on Momentum's slate of promoted candidates due to his role as chair of the Campaign for Labour Party Democracy. During a meeting in 2016, Willsman declared that he wanted the party to split to \\"get rid of the Blairites\\". In 2017, he said some disloyal Labour MPs \\"deserve to be attacked\\", though sources present at the meeting said it was clear that he meant the MPs should be criticised, rather than face physical violence. = Antisemitism allegations= In July 2018, Willsman was recorded during an NEC discussion on the party's disciplinary code and antisemitism as saying that he had \\"never seen\\" antisemitism in the Labour Party. He claimed that those making the accusations were \\"Trump fanatics\\" who were \\"making up duff information without any evidence at all\\". He was criticised by The Guardian and some Labour politicians, Marie van der Zyl, president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, called for Willsman to be expelled and the Jewish Labour Movement made a formal complaint. After Willsman apologised, party chair Jennie Formby warned that a repeat occurrence would result in disciplinary action. Momentum withdrew its support for his candidacy for the NEC, even though voting had commenced, describing his remarks as \\"deeply insensitive and inappropriate\\", although he retained the support of Jewish Voice for Labour. He came in ninth place and was re-elected in the expanded section representing members: when other members of the Momentum slate asked him to resign given the late withdrawal of Momentum's endorsement, Willsman declined. In May 2019, a recording of Willsman emerged from an informal conversation he had had with Israeli-American undercover author Tuvia Tenenbom in January 2019, which Willsman had been unaware was being recorded. Willsman had said \\"Almost certainly it was the Israeli embassy (behind the antisemitism allegations). They caught somebody in the Labour Party. It turns out they were an agent in the Israeli Embassy\\". In 2017, the influential documentary series, The Lobby, an investigation by Al Jazeera, had been broadcast, focusing on the activities of an Israeli embassy official in the Labour Party and more widely. Willsman also said that an open letter on the issue signed by 68 rabbis the previous year was \\"obviously organised by the Israeli embassy\\".https://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/labour-s-pete-willsman-recorded- ranting-the-israeli-embassy-is-fuelling-antisemitism-crisis-1.484944 Willsman's comments were widely condemned, with several members of the NEC and Labour MPs calling for his expulsion, although Jewish Voice for Labour‚Äôs Mike Cushman said ‚ÄúIt is Pete‚Äôs claims that the embassy has managed to infiltrate the party that should be the subject of urgent investigation, not Pete‚Äôs actions in drawing our attentions to the possibility\\". Later that month, Willsman was suspended from the party over the allegation, pending investigation.

He was a member of the Michigan House of Representatives in its first year of existence, and was also a regent of the University of Michigan in its first years as a statewide elected body.  Biography  Elisha Ely was born on April 27, 1784, in West Springfield, Massachusetts, the son of John Ely and Abigail Montague. During the War of 1812, General Peter B. Porter organized a company of dragoons under the command of Major Isaac W. Stone, and Ely was commissioned as a captain. This unit of about fifty men was responsible for repelling, after a brief exchange of cannon fire, the attempted landing by the British admiral Sir James Yeo at Charlotte in May 1814. Ely formed a company to transport the mail between Canandaigua, and Lewiston, New York, in 1816. He was named the surrogate of Monroe County, New York, on March 10, 1821. The following year he became county clerk following Nathaniel Rochester's election to the state assembly, and served until 1826. He also served as a trustee of Rochester High School following its establishment in 1827. In 1833 Ely purchased a one-third share of a tract of land in Michigan, on the site of what later became the town of Allegan, and, along with his partners, built a sawmill on the property. His son, Alexander L. Ely, acted as the principal manager. Elisha made a tour of the area that year and returned to Rochester in 1834, before moving to Allegan permanently in 1835. By 1835, the population of the area was large enough to warrant organization as a separate county rather than a township attached to Kalamazoo County, and at a meeting to organize Allegan County held on August 12, 1835, Ely was elected as a judge of the new county. He was elected as the county's representative to the newly-formed Michigan House of Representatives in the November 5 election that also approved the new state constitution, by a vote of 31 to 30 over Dr. Lintsford B. Coats. The constitution, which had been drafted prior to Allegan County's organization, did not explicitly allocate the seat to which Ely was elected, but since the county was duly organized prior to final approval of the constitution, the House allowed him to take his seat. Ely was appointed superintendent of the poor for Allegan County in 1839; sources do not indicate how long he held the position. Michigan adopted a new constitution in 1850 that called for the election, rather than appointment, of the Regents of the University of Michigan. Ely was one of the eight men elected in 1851, and served until his death in 1854. During his tenure, the Board of Regents chose the first president of the university, Henry Philip Tappan. Ely died in Allegan on November 3, 1854. = Family = Ely married Hannah Dickinson of Hatfield, Massachusetts, on November 11, 1807. They had two children who died young, Mary and Elisha, and seven who survived to adulthood, Alexander Leicester, Elisha Dickinson, Heman Billings, Caroline, John Fellows, George Hervey, and Samuel Partridge. Hannah Ely died of cholera in Rochester on August 30, 1832. Ely remarried in Detroit in April 1837, to Ann Garrison, originally of New York City; she outlived him, dying in Marshall, Michigan, on February 20, 1873.

Early life Taaffe was born Olivia Mary Blake on 24 June 1832 in Annagh House, near Tuam, Co. Galway, Ireland to John Joseph Blake and Elizabeth Bodkin. She was born with a twin brother who did not survive. Her father and mother both came from well to do Catholic families. However shortly after her birth her mother died. She and her sister were raised by two aunts and their grandmother and moved between the family homes in the country and Dublin, living occasionally with cousins. Taaffe was educated at home by French governesses and finished her education in Paris. Her sister went on to become a teacher, Sr Mary Ignatius of the Presentation Sisters in Midleton. May 29, 1867 she married John Joseph Taaffe of Smarmore Castle Co. Louth in St. Michael's Church, D√∫n Laoghaire. They toured Europe for their honeymoon and had an audience with Pope Pius IX. Taaffe ran her husband's estate and was a generous benefactor to the local widows and orphans especially in the period after a minor famine in 1879. Her popularity helped keep tensions reduced during the land wars in the 1880s. Taaffe had a shrine including a stained glass window in honour of St Joseph erected in the local church of St Catherine's, Ballapousta near Ardee. Later life St Catherine's church was built in 1831 and contained Taaffe's gifts and eventually her grave Her husband always suffered with ill health and died in 1890. Her only son George Robert died of tuberculosis in 1894 after his mother took him to Switzerland in an attempt to help him. Because the lands of her husband were entailed his nephew was the new heir to the estates and Taaffe was left homeless and with a limited income. Initially she moved into the Presentation convent in Lucan but she had no intention of becoming a nun. She still had a certain income of her own and used it to move to Dublin. Having spent years involved in charity work, Taaffe focused on it now. From 1867 she had been a friend of Canon Joseph L√©on Roy. He had established an archconfraternity and shrine for St. Joseph at Maranville, France. After becoming a widow Taaffe became the administrator and secretary of the Irish branch. She mostly lived in Dublin after that. In 1895 she arranged for the publication of an Irish edition of the association's magazine and created what went on to become St Joseph's Young Priests Society. They educated young Irish men who wanted to become priests in Asia. Taaffe ensured support of the organisation with successful fund raising events. Her work in establishing the society with Fr Browne and Fr Darlington, the first editors of the magazine, were so successful that the organisation expanded from being able to fund the education of the original 2 men to 36 men by 1923 and had over 100,000 members by 1997 and funded 711 young men. Taaffe died on May 3, 1918. She is buried with her husband and son at the graveyard at St Catherine's church, Ballapousta, Ardee.

Smino's Blk Juptr is a fantastic sophomore project, and for many a first introduction. It is a multifaceted EP that will take some time to get through, but is worth the time spent.\\" The Chicago Reader claimed \\"The instrumentals chatter and hum, reverberating with intimacy and quietly blossoming as Booker arranges and rearranges his minimal palette. Smino follows the music's changing moods with his slippery flow, which can shift from a poised croon to a playful, coiled snarl without drawing too much attention to the change. Even in its quietest moments, Blk Juptr sounds bustling.\\" These Days said \\"blkjuptr is a body of work rooted in Smino‚Äôs awareness of his surroundings. As the title track begins, Smino‚Äôs saccharine drawl hides in producer Monte Booker‚Äôs crescendoing synths.

Life He was born in Berlin and trained under Antoine Pesne before being summoned to Neustrelitz by Adolphus Frederick IV to be his court painter. He remained in the town until his death there. He mainly produced portraits of Adolphus Frederick and his family, though he did also produce altarpieces (such as that for the Nikolaikirche in Friedland) and produced drawings which others worked up for engravings. All the major museums in Mecklenburg have paintings by him in their collections - there are also some in the portrait collection at Gripsholm Castle in Sweden. In 1770 he was commissioned by Crown Prince Charles to paint a series in oils showing the Prillwitz idols. Johann Conrad Kr√ºger produced engravings after the original paintings and these were included in the 1771 volume Die gottesdienstlichen Alterth√ºmer der Obotriten aus dem Tempel zu Rhetra, am Tollenzer-See, co-authored by Andreas Gottlieb Masch and Woge himselfDigitised copy at the Herzog August Bibliothek  Selected works Duke Adolphus Frederick IV and His Siblings, Staatliches Museum Schwerin.

It is on Piccadilly Approach outside the main entrance of Manchester Piccadilly station and was commissioned to commemorate the centenary of the First World War. The sculpture depicts seven blind figures guiding each other and walking together; their likeness are based upon real veterans who all suffered blindness as a result of action on the frontline. Unusually a plinth is not used and the figures are situated at eye level to engage passers-by. It was commissioned by the Blind Veterans UK and was unveiled in October 2018. It is believed to be the only memorial to depict those wounded in the First World War. Background The location for a permanent memorial to commemorate the centenary of the First World War was supported by both Network Rail and Transport for Greater Manchester. The exterior area outside the main entrance of Piccadilly station has historically been used for temporary exhibits and sculptures such as the Bee in the City art trail in 2018. The sculpture was first created to mark the centenary of the Blind Veterans UK charity in 2015 and which now sits at the charity's Llandudno rehabilitation and training centre. A cement cast of the sculpture was first unveiled in 2017 at the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire. With funding from the Gosling Foundation and support for a prominent location in Manchester, Blind Veterans UK commissioned the sculpture to commemorate the centenary of the First World War. The sculpture was officially unveiled on 16 October 2018 by The Countess of Wessex. In a short ceremony and speech, she stated that, \\"As we approach the anniversary of the end of the First World War and, quite rightly, remember all of those who never returned, it is also important to remember those who did, changed by their experiences.\\" Depiction The sculpture depicts seven life-sized figures guiding one another. It was inspired by a photograph the sculptor saw of World War I veterans, blinded in combat, leading one another from the front. Whereas statues or sculptures of lifelike individuals are generally placed on plinths, it was decided the sculpture should be situated on the ground and at eye level to engage passers-by and to highlight the notion that the sacrifices of those on the frontline in World War I should not be forgotten. The sculptor, Johanna Domke-Guyot, stated that \\"People will be able to touch them, I want it to become a people's piece\\". The seven figures are all based upon World War I veterans who all suffered blindess as a result of action on the frontline and each figure depicts a similar likeness to the veterans. The sculpture was well-received with it being described as \\"moving\\" for its subject matter and \\"striking\\" for its interaction with passers-by at eye level.

Wickham (1886 - 1967) was a Solomon Islander swimmer and diver. Wickham resided in Sydney from 1901‚Äì1927 where he achieved several national and New South Wales titles for swimming. Yet perhaps Wickham's most significant achievement is his 62-meter (205 feet, nine inches) swan dive into the Yarra River, Melbourne in 1918 in which he was credited with breaking a world diving record and attracted more than 70,000 spectators from all across Melbourne. Wickham is also widely known for being a pioneer of the modern front crawl.  Early life  Wickham was born on 1 June 1886 in Gizo, New Georgia in the Solomon Islands to Frank Wickham (q.v) and Pinge Naru. He was of predominately Melanesian heritage and had at least one sibling, a brother, Ted who was killed while serving as a soldier in France. At the age of 7, he moved from the Solomon Islands to Sydney in his father's schooner. In Sydney, as a schoolboy, Wickham would work as a 'house boy' and in his free time, he would swim at the sea baths in Bronte Beach where he was often observed by prominent members of the Australian sporting scene including notable Australian coach of the time, George Farmer. Farmer would observe speedy Wickham and shout, \\"look at that kid crawling!\\" From this comment the stroke label, the Australian crawl, was coined then later developed by other swimmers. Sydneysider, Arthur Freeman would watch Wickham too and claimed that, \\"Wickham's six-beat kick reminded me [Freeman] of an outboard motor\\".  Sporting achievements  As an aquatic sportsman and pioneer, Wickham served as the inaugural Australasian dive champion in 1904 and from 1908‚Äì1912 was the New South Wales state champion for both diving and swimming. Wickham is also credited as having a role to play in the development of body surfing. Wickham often performed at swimming carnivals and events where he showcased his wild stunts. He also achieved the unofficial world record for fifty-yards freestyle in 1910. = Record dive = In April 1918, Wickham took what was purported to be a record-breaking 62-meter swan dive into the Yarra River at Deep Rock Swimming Club. Up to 70,000 inner-city residents came to watch in awe at Wickham's eventful dive. In the early 20th century, the much cleaner Yarra River was a popular place to swim for Melbournians and saw a peak in popularity in the 1920s. Wickham's dive was partially organised by notorious businessman, John Wren to raise funds for Australian soldiers. An article titled \\"Alick Wickham's Sensational Dive\\" by W.F. Corbett published by Sydney- based newspaper The Referee on Wednesday 17 April 1918 describes Wickham's momentous 62 meter high dive. In an interview included in the article following the dive Wickham says, \\"I [Wickham] could not say how I reached the water or how I struck it. But I do know that I was sore and bleeding in places from the chest to the waist. My costume was torn from neck to knee. Must have hit the surface with my body you think. So do I\\".  Personal life  At the time Wickham was known as quite an 'exotic' identity and was often billed as a foreign prince, Prince Wickyama. Wickham and Dorothy Bellisario Fraser were married on 25 July 1917 in Sydney. The couple gave birth to a daughter named Joyce (c. 1918‚Äì1996). Too old for competitive swimming, Wickham drove taxis to make ends meet and took part in a variety of other jobs. After the death of his father in the late 1920s, Wickham permanently returned to the Solomon Islands and led a life of obscurity. He then remarried three times and had at least two children. Wickham remarried to Ima Tako (c. 1880s‚Äì1969) on the island of Munda with whom he had two sons, Rex Pae (d. 2002) and Alick Gena (Kena) Wickham (d. 2001). With the exception of working as a scout in World War II, Wickham spent the last years of his life in Munda. He died in hospital in the nation's capital, Honiara of natural causes on 10 or 11 August 1967 and was buried in the Old Colonial Graveyard in Honiara.  Legacy  Wickham is recognised in the International Swimming Hall of Fame in the United States and the Australian Sporting Hall of Fame for being one of the first to introduce the freestyle stroke to Australia and is featured in documentaries on television, the radio, movies and in many books and articles. While in the Solomon Islands, he is honoured in many sites including a swimming pool in Honiara carrying his namesake since 1973. He also featured in commemorative postal stamp booklets in the Solomon Islands in 1984. The site of Wickham's most recognized dive is located by the Yarra River in Yarra Bend Park, Fairfield and is marked with a placard. This site is also the former Deep Rock Swimming Club.

Description  Dendrobium adae is an epiphytic or lithophytic herb that has wiry, cylinder-shaped pseudobulbs long and wide and between two and four dark green leaves long and wide. The flowering stem is long and bears up to six resupinate white or greenish to apricot-coloured flowers long and wide. The dorsal sepal is erect, oblong, long and wide. The lateral sepals are a curved triangular shape, long and about wide. The petals are lance-shaped, curved inwards and slightly shorter and narrower than the lateral sepals. The labellum is white with reddish markings, about long and wide with short hairs and three lobes. The side lobes curve upwards and the middle lobe has a ridge along its midline. Flowering occurs between July and October. Taxonomy and naming Dendrobium adae was first formally described in 1884 by Frederick Manson Bailey from a specimen collected near Herberton and the description was published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society of Queensland. The specific epithet (adae) is \\"in honour of Mrs. J. W R. Stuart\\" who collected the type specimen.

She joined the MIT faculty in 2004 and CSAIL in 2012.  Research  Oliva's group investigates how psychological perception of an image can change based on memorability, content, and limitations of human visual systems. Her most recognizable work is the hybrid image, the classic example of which combines the high-frequency outline and detail of Albert Einstein's face with a blurry, low-frequency image of Marilyn Monroe; the latter becomes focused only when viewed from long distances. Such images have found use in information privacy, time-lapses, marketing, and brainteasers. Another branch of her research deals with object-vs-scene image processing in human brains, where Oliva and others have postulated that part of our visual system focuses on a fast recognition and classification of a familiar scene (birthday party) rather than individual component objects in the scene (cake). She has most recently used deep learning to teach computers how to recognize locations in an image by a combination of its features. For example, a bed, window, and posters might indicate a bedroom, while a stove, tile, and countertop might indicate a kitchen. Oliva's work has been used by those in the field of artificial imagination, the concept of building a human-like consciousness from computer algorithms.
