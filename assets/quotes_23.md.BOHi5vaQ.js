It is a xanthophyll cycle pigment, an oil-soluble alcohol within the xanthophyll subgroup of carotenoids. Antheraxanthin is both a component in and product of the cellular photoprotection mechanisms in photosynthetic green algae, red algae, euglenoids, and plants.Duan S, and Bianchi T, 2006. Seasonal changes in the abundance and composition of plant pigments in particulate organic carbon in the lower Mississippi and Pearl Rivers. Estuaries and Coasts 29, 427-442Sandman, G. 2009. Evolution of carotene desaturation: the complication of a simple pathway. Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics 483, 169‚Äì174  In the xanthophyll cycle  Antheraxanthin has been found in high levels in sun-exposed dandelions (Taraxacum officianale). Antheraxanthin is an intermediate molecule of the xanthophyll cycle in most photosynthetic eukaryotes, namely plants, and some bacteria. In the xanthophyll cycle, specific carotenoid pigments are transformed via enzymatic reactions into either more or less photoprotective biological pigments.Yamamoto HY, 1979. Biochemistry of the violaxanthin cycle in higher plants. Pure Applied Chemistry 51, 639‚Äì648 A plant can increase its capacity for non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) and excess heat dissipation by converting the orange pigment violaxanthin to antheraxanthin and then to light-yellow pigment zeaxanthin.Adir N, Zer H, Shochat S, & Ohad I. 2003. Photoinhibition‚Äîa historical perspective. Photosynthesis Research 76, 343‚Äì370 The xanthophyll pool, or total xanthophyll cycle pigment levels are sometimes abbreviated as ‚ÄúVAZ‚Äù in scientific literature.Krause GH & Weis E, 1991. Chlorophyll fluorescence and photosynthesis: the basics. Annual Review of Plant Physiology and Plant Molecular Biology 42, 313‚Äì349 ‚ÄúVAZ‚Äù is an abbreviation of the cycle‚Äôs main pigments in order of lowest to highest photoprotection each pigment provides. Antheraxanthin is denoted by the ‚ÄúA‚Äù in the middle, between violaxanthin (V) and zeaxanthin (Z).Kov√°ƒç D, et al 2013. Response of green reflectance continuum removal index to the xanthophyll de- epoxidation cycle in Norway spruce needles. Journal of Experimental Botany 64, 1817-1827  Location in thylakoid membrane  The xanthophyll cycle takes place, along with other photopigment reactions, in the membranes of thylakoids within chloroplasts.Eskling M, Arvidsson P, & Akerland H, 1997. The xanthophyll cycle, its regulation and components. Physiologia Plantarum 100, 806-816 Antheraxanthin provides more heat and light stability (via NPQ) to the thylakoid membranes than violaxanthin, but less than zeaxanthin.Havaux M, 1998. Carotenoids as membrane stabilizers in chloroplasts. Trends in Plant Science 3, 147-151 Xanthophyll cycle reactions, where antheraxanthin is an intermediate stage, are usually responses to changes in light or radiation exposure, which cause changes in the internal pH of thylakoids. Lessening or heightening photoprotection through the xanthophyll cycle allows plants to regulate their own light uptake for photosynthesis. The majority of chloroplasts are located in a plant's mesophyll tissue cells, just below the epidermis (surface) layer of leaves and stems. Since thylakoids are contained within chloroplasts, antheraxanthin and other photopigments are in their highest concentrations in the leaves of plants under high solar radiation or light/heat exposure. A high-altitude study with dandelions (Taraxacum officianale) in the Andes Mountains found overall high rates of antheraxanthin accumulation in highly exposed leaves on a NW-facing slope at 1600 meter and even higher rates on a summit at 3600 meter.Molina-Montenegro MA, Penuelas J, Munne-Bosch S, & Sardans J, 2012. Higher plasticity in ecophysiological traits enhances the performance and invasion success of Taraxacum officinale (dandelion) in alpine environments. Biology of Invasions 14, 21-33  Enzymes and reactions  Antheraxanthin is a partially de-epoxidized (see de- epoxidation) form of violaxanthin. One of violaxanthin‚Äôs two epoxide groups are removed from its chemical structure to generate antheraxanthin.Eskling M, Arvidsson P, & √Ökerlund H, 1997. The xanthophyll cycle, its regulation and components. Physiologia Plantarum 100, 806-816 For this reason, the xanthophyll cycle is sometimes called the violaxanthin cycle. Violaxanthin de- epoxidase is an enzyme that reduces one epoxide group from violaxanthin into a double bond to create antheraxanthin. It also functions to create zeaxanthin, where it catalyses the reduction of two epoxide groups from violaxanthin. Zeaxanthin epoxidase catalyses the attachment of one epoxide group to zeaxanthin to generate antheraxanthin, and two epoxide groups to generate violaxanthin.

Background George trained as an artist at the Ilam School of Fine Arts in Canterbury and graduated with a BFA in painting in 1993. He subsequently completed a Diploma in Teaching, and then, studied towards a MFA (painting) at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology. George is the Head of the Art Department at Christ‚Äôs College in Christchurch. His work Darryn George, Atua, 2011, oil on canvas George connects minimalist abstraction and the politics of photographic reproduction which has long influenced New Zealand art. George explores the contrast between the sheen and glossy photographic images accessible in books and the textural quality of paintings when encountered in real life. Whereas George uses abstract patterns that recall the pristine and hard-edged aspect of photographic representations in books, his paintings also include subtleties on the surface such as ridges and wobbly lines differentiating it from photographic reproductions. George has an interesting work process. While he principally works with oil on canvas, George primarily envisions his works on computer screens playing around with size, colours, motifs, orientation and texture, adding and amending elements which have been present in his work since 2003. Such experiments result in a group of images which become paintings and other which George archives on his computer. George‚Äôs paintings contain both abstract and figurative designs including numbers, symbols and words. The palette for George‚Äôs works remains strongly connected to its place and Maori heritage as does the range of symbols which can be found in his paintings such as the kowhaiwhai, moko and koru patterns. George has exhibited widely around New Zealand and Australia and is represented by several galleries including Gow Langsford Gallery in Auckland, Brooke/Gifford Gallery in Christchurch, Peter McLeavey Gallery in Wellington and The Gallery at Woollaston in Nelson.

It is Australia's largest privately owned development company, being fully owned and operated by its high-profile co-founder and Chairman, Lang Walker. Most notably, Walker Corporation is responsible for the development and restoration of a number of significant Australian sites, including King Street Wharf, Finger Wharf, Broadway Shopping Centre and Rhodes Waterside shopping centre in Sydney. Walker Corporation recently completed their large Collins Square project in Melbourne's Docklands and is using their IP to develop a new precinct in Parramatta, Sydney. In August 2016 Walker Corporation, a major Liberal party donor, used a meeting with then Minister for the Environment and Energy Josh Frydenberg to lobby for boundary changes to reduce the size of an important internationally listed Ramsar Wetland for its Toondah Harbour apartment and retail development. The company wanted to reclaim and dredge about 40ha of the wetland which is critical in hosting around 20% of the world's migratory Eastern Curlew bird species. History In the late 1960s, Lang Walker, along with his father Alec Walker, established A & L Walker Pty Ltd in New South Wales as a plant hire and earth moving contractor. In 1972, Lang Walker founded The Walker Group, a company specialising in the new roads construction, and subdivision development. In 1977, The Walker Group began residential development activities. Throughout 1979 and 1980, the group undertook the development of a number of small office buildings and lower-density residential projects throughout southern Sydney. During the early 1980s, The Walker Group undertook subdivision projects throughout Brisbane and Sydney. Meanwhile, Walker Constructions Pty Ltd was established to perform the construction aspects of the Group's development projects. In the late 1980s, the Group focussed on residential and industrial development projects, and civil engineering projects in Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney. In 1988, The Walker Group was officially renamed to Walker Corporation Pty Limited. During the 1990s, Walker Corporation primarily developed residential and retail properties. During this time, the business expanded significantly. In 1993, the corporation participated in the establishment of the listed property trust The Industrial Property Trust of Australia, as a joint manager with Macquarie Bank Ltd. In 1994, the company floated. Lang Walker retained his position as the Managing Director, while projects under the control of Walker Corporation Limited went on to generate over $2 billion in sales revenue, while employing over 375 full-time staff. In 1999, Lang Walker elected to sell his held shares in Walker Corporation Ltd to Australand Holdings Limited, to focus on running his private development company McRoss Developments Pty Ltd. Mr Walker reserved the right to reuse the Walker Corporation name after January 2003. In 2000, the company acquired the Queensland property Hope Island Resort, including an 18-hole golf course, and approximately 2,000 housing allotments. In 2003, Lang Walker exercised his right to reuse the Walker Corporation name, renaming McRoss Developments Pty Ltd as Walker Corporation. In 2006, Walker Corporation sold over $1.25 billion worth of assets to Mirvac, while continuing to develop over 20 projects across retail, commercial, residential and industrial sectors. In 2008, Walker Corporation began its first Malaysian development, beginning work on Senibong Cove, a mixed-use development situated across 213 acres of waterfront land in Johor Bahru.

She was designed and built for use in the North Sea towards the end of the 1960s. Most probably, she was the world's first ship built to the SWATH design principle. After two years of trials and initial use, she was rebuilt into a hybrid form between SWATH ship and catamaran. History 'Duplus' was designed by the Dutch construction office Trident Offshore. She was built as hull #1033 at Boele's Scheepswerf & Machienefabriek N.V. in Bolnes, Netherlands. In 1969, she was launched and sea trials started. The owners, the Netherlands Offshore Company (original name Nederlandse Maatschappij voor Werken Buitengaats), expected her experimental concept to deliver a usability in rough seas greater than what was known of single-[hull] ships. Starting in 1969, 'Duplus' was active in the North Sea for 15 years, performing duty as a diving support ship, for drilling seabed samples and as a standby vessel. After a sale to McDermott, Inc. in 1980, she was renamed to 'Jaramac 57' and registered in Panama. In 1984, she was sold to International Underwater Contractors and renamed to 'Twin Drill'. Under this name, she was active in the Gulf of Mexico for another ten years. After being laid up for an extended period, she was broken up in Mobile, AL in 2004.

The Dutch Hunebedden, University of Michigan. is an early form of dolmen or megalithic tomb that occurs especially in Northern Europe. The term was defined by archaeologist, Ernst Sprockhoff, and utilised by Ewald Schuldt in publicising his excavation of 106 megalithic sites in the north German state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. The simple dolmen emerged in the early days of the development of megalithic monuments of the Funnelbeaker culture (TBK) and around 3,500 BC they appeared across almost the entire region covered by the stone cult structures of Nordic megalith architecture, but not in the Netherlands, in Lower Saxony west of the River Weser nor east of the River Oder and only once in Sweden (Lejeby Laholm). Neolithic monuments are an expression of the culture and ideology of neolithic communities. Their emergence and function serve as indicators of social development.J. M√ºller In: Varia neolithica VI 2009 p. 15  Distinction between simple dolmens and stone cists  In many cases there is no clear distinction between simple dolmens and stone cists.Ewald Schuldt: Die Nekropole von Wollschow Kreis Pasewalk und das Problem der neolithischen Steinkisten in Mecklenburg In: Jahrbuch der Bodendenkmalpflege in Mecklenburg 1974 (1975) pp. 77‚Äì144This detailed classification of dolmens into subtypes is only common in Germany. In the Netherlands and Poland these types do not occur. In Denmark and Sweden a distinction is only made between dolmens (Dysse, D√∂se) and passage graves. In Denmark the type of mound is used to distinguish dolmens in the nomenclature (Runddysse and Langdysse) In the necropolis of Br√ºssow-Wollschow, in the Uckermark region, simple dolmens and stone cists occur together. The differences consist in the degree to which they are embedded and in the material used for the sidestones (orthostats). In simple dolmens the sidestones consist of rubble, in stone cists of slabs. Whether this was of relevance for neolithic people, remains questionable, because there are also combinations of both materials. Evolution Monte Bubbonia dolmen, Sicily The smallest simple dolmens occur on the Danish island of Zealand, where the ratio of length-to-breadth of the southern half of the island (Dolmen of Jyderup) (1.7 x 0.6 m) is even less in the north. This small size led researchers such as Hans-J√ºrgen Beier, to refuse to give simple dolmens the status of a megalithic site. Whether, however, the equally very small megalithic tombs fulfil his conditions, is still open to question. Also in Sicily, in recent years, are being found small dolmen monuments, because around the end of the 3rd millennium BC, the west coast of the Mediterranean island was caught up in a cultural wave (bringing the bell-shaped goblet) coming the Sardinian coast, which in turn had imported from the peninsula Iberica.Salvatore Piccolo, Ancient Stones, op. cit., pp. 4 and 32. Cava dei Servi dolmen, Sicily You can follow the evolution of simple dolmens, which for the early builders was a learning process, and how, step by step, they met the demands placed on them at the time by producing ever more mature (and larger) solutions. This also applies to the development of simple dolmens into extended dolmens (also called rectangular dolmens), to its round variant, the polygonal dolmen, and to the great dolmens. Block cists The prototype of the simple dolmen is the so-called block cist, enclosed on all sides and dug into the ground. It has no entrance and is, once closed, difficult for the technically less skilled user to open and re-utilise. It was therefore only intended for a one-time use. On the island of Sylt in Schleswig-Holstein, two simple dolmens were found in a common enclosure (H√ºnenbett). But there is usually only one simple dolmen within an enclosure, lying parallel to the longitudinal axis, the so-called parallel type (Parallellieger). In Ulstrup near Gundeslevholm two of the three simple dolmens form a pair next to one another in the enclosure. The block cist in the Tykskov of Varn√¶s near Aabenraa and the one in the N√∏rreskov on Alsen lie diagonally within the enclosure. North of the River Eider about 20% of the simple dolmens are covered by a circular mound. Access Initial progress - in terms of multiple use - was achieved by the creation of an entrance. In examples that were still dug into the ground the entrance was (in Denmark and Mecklenburg- Western Pomerania) initially made through the roof - as, for example, at Barkvieren. By dividing the ceiling into a large stone and a stone that could be lifted by hand, access from above was enabled. This variant, however, is not very widespread. Breakdown of the 18 simple dolmens researched by Schuldt This development path was abandoned in favour of options using other axes of entry. The simple dolmen was now buried less deeply and the upper half of one of the ends was used as access. This form can be found e.g. in the stone enclosures of Grundoldendorf. The weight of the single stone was still divided amongst three orthostats. This process shows the discovery of the stability of a three-point support system. The always parallel-sided open simple dolmens are 2.2 to 2.6 metres long and 1.0 to 1.8 metres wide and slightly larger than the closed examples. For Schleswig-Holstein, the small chamber at Dobersdorf Pl√∂n county, (only 1.8 metres long x 0.5 metres wide) is, in this respect, an exception. Of the 20 simple dolmens in Schleswig-Holstein, 12 are sealed on all sides, five are classified as open at the end and the design of three (destroyed) simple dolmens cannot be determined. Of about 88 simple dolmens once found in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern there are still 51 survivors. Subsequently, the first rectangular dolmens (Grammdorf in the municipality of Wangels) and passage graves (Deinste) were built, still sunk in pits. In the next step, the neolithic builders understood how to lay the foundation of the three or more supporting stones (which in simple dolmens were always placed on their longest sides) in such a way that their base of the structure could be closer to the surface of the ground. This higher positioning allowed a passage to be added that led into the chamber at ground level (below right). Now, however, a threshold stone was required that separated the chamber and the profane or secular passage (symbolically) from one another. The effort was made to reduce the size of the slab covering the opening of the re-usable simple dolmen to one that could be manhandled by the settlement community. The simple dolmen with a passage evolved into the \\"extended dolmens\\", which are generally longer, usually have more than one capstone and - apart from the transitional types at Neu Gaarz, Bad Doberan county - have orthostats that stand on one of their two smallest faces, thus allowing the roof of the chamber to be higher. Simple dolmens once lay within stone enclosures or under circular mounds, but many of these have been removed. The simple dolmen at Lindeskov on Fyn lies within a 168-metre-long enclosure, the second longest in Denmark (after the Kardybdysse, 185 m). By comparison, the longest German enclosure measures 160 metres. In Poland, the length of one chamberless enclosure is 130 metres.Staatliches Museum f√ºr Naturkunde und Vorgeschichte Oldenburg J. A.

Her husband Watkin Williams then added the Wynn family name to his own.Jacob Youde William Lloyd, The history of the princes, the lords marcher, and the ancient nobility of Powys Fadog, and the ancient lords of Arwystli, Cedewen, and Meirionydd, vol. 6 (T.

He volunteered for service in the Second Boer War, and was seconded for service in the Imperial Yeomanry on 24 February 1900, where he was appointed a captain in the 31st Company of the 9th Battalion. After arrival in South Africa, he saw active service in the Transvaal and the Orange River Colony and was on the staff of Lord Chesham. He was promoted to major on 14 May 1902. For his service during the war, he was appointed a Companion of the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) in the South Africa Honours list published on 26 June 1902. From 1905 to 1917 he was the colonel commanding the Montgomeryshire Yeomanry and saw further active service in Egypt during the First World War, when he was three times mentioned in dispatches and held two district commands. He was appointed Honorary Colonel of the 61st (Carnarvon & Denbigh Yeomanry) Medium Regiment, Royal Artillery on 7 February 1923.Army List.

In 1928 Williams-Wynn was appointed as Lord Lieutenant of Denbighshire, remaining in post until his death in 1951. He was also a Justice of the Peace for Denbighshire and Flintshire and was Master of the Flint and Denbigh Foxhounds for fifty-eight years, from 1888 to 1946. In 1938 he was knighted by being appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB). In 1949, at the age of eighty-seven, he inherited the Williams-Wynn Baronetcy and estates from a cousin, Sir Watkin Williams-Wynn, 8th Baronet (1891‚Äì1949), who had died without a surviving son.

The Dutch Hunebedden, University of Michigan. is a specific type of megalith, rectangular in shape, with upright sidestones and, usually, two capstones. The term rectangular dolmen was coined by Ekkehard AnerThis detailed classification of dolmens into subtypes is only common in Germany. In the Netherlands and Poland these types do not occur. In Denmark and Sweden a distinction is only made between dolmens (Dysse, D√∂se) and passage graves. In Denmark the type of mound is used to distinguish dolmens in the nomenclature (Runddysse and Langdysse) and is used especially in the German state of Schleswig-Holstein, where dolmens with this type of ground plan primarily occur. A more precise term, however, is extended dolmen, used by Ewald Schuldt and Ernst Sprockhoff, because these types of dolmen also occur with trapezoidal ground plans (e.g. the Gnewitz). Neolithic monuments are an expression of the culture and ideology of neolithic communities. Their emergence and function are a hallmark of social development.J. M√ºller In: Varia neolithica VI 2009 p. 15 sections and a polygonal dolmen (below)  Capstones and passageway  Whilst the simple dolmen as a rule only had one capstone (but could have two), the rectangular dolmen, which differs primarily in the orientation of its support stones (standing) from the simple dolmen (lying), usually had two capstones (but also can have just one). Once a third capstone is added, it is called a great dolmen (Gro√üdolmen) in Germany. A sub- grouping of this type of dolmen is based on the ever-present entranceway, which, for example, could be designed with a roof-height half stone or single- angle (einwinkelnd) support stones.  Mounds  Within long mounds, rectangular dolmens are usually oriented at right angles to the axis of the enclosure. The proportion of rectangular dolmens in round (including oval) mounds, compared with simple dolmens, increases in Schleswig-Holstein from 20% to at least 27%. The proportion of mounds is probably higher, because experience has shown that circular mounds leave fewer traces than stone enclosures. In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, however only two of the 20 \\"extended dolmens\\" surveyed by E. Schuldt were covered by round mounds.  Entrances  Most types of dolmen that form part of the Nordic megalith architecture genre are open at one end (i.e. are accessible). Occasionally, a short passage is built in front the chamber, often of just one or two pairs of stones of 1.0-1.5 metres in length. Even at undisturbed sites, it is often so short that it does not extend out as far as the stones of the enclosure or the stones around the mound, and just forms the ante-chamber to the main chamber. The place in the enclosure where one would have expected there to be a gap is closed, so that the stone in the row forming a side of the enclosure would have to be removed in order the get into the dolmen. Monte Bubbonia dolmen, Sicily In Denmark and Sweden, the passages could be much longer, especially in the round mounds that are much more common there. In Sicily, Monte Bubbonia dolmen is a chambered tomb 2.20 mt length, made of colossal splinters of rock, with no significant modifications, in rectangular shape.Salvatore Piccolo, Ancient Stones: The Prehistoric dolmens of Sicily, Brazen Head Publishing, Thornham/Norfolk 2013, pp. 9-12  Distribution  Rectangular dolmens, which are generally over 2 metres, and sometimes over 3 metres, in length and 0.9 to 1.5 metres wide, continued the trend of increasing the size of the interior of the chamber, a tendency already seen in the development of simple dolmens. About 145 of these chambers occur in Schleswig-Holstein, where it the most common type of dolmen. It is also found throughout the entire coastal region and on the East Frisian Islands and its distribution reaches the Elbe south of Lake Pl√∂n, where it is also seen south of the river in Lower Saxony. In Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, 54 extended dolmens have survived of an estimated 98 formerly. Rectangular dolmens also occur in groups within stone enclosures. Whilst in Denmark up to five dolmens may be found in one enclosure (Stenbjergg√•rd Barrow), in Germany the sites at Waabs in the district of Rendsburg-Eckernf√∂rde has three rectangular dolmens and the one at Kampen on Sylt has three polygonal dolmens in a single enclosure (both are in Schleswig- Holstein). A far greater number of enclosures, but also a few round mounds, have two dolmens or chambers.

It first aired on NBC on October 28, 1982. This episode guest stars Allyce Beasley as Coach's daughter, Lisa Pantusso. In this episode, Lisa arrives with her fianc√© Roy, who is boorish and obnoxious and rude to her, causing Coach to resent him. When it first aired, this episode scored very low Nielsen ratings; however, network reruns of this episode improved. Although it did not earn award nominations, it has been praised as a favorite by critics and cast alike, including the late Nicholas Colasanto.  Plot  Allyce Beasley portrays Coach's daughter, Lisa Pantusso, in this episode. Coach's (Nicholas Colasanto) daughter Lisa (Allyce Beasley), a district manager of her company, arrives with her fianc√© Roy (Philip Charles MacKenzie), a door-to-door salesman who works for her company and turns out to be abrasive and insensitive.Lisa personally characterizes Roy during her conversation with Coach in the office. Repulsed by Roy's obnoxious, boorish personality and insults toward people, including Lisa, Coach finds Roy not good enough for her. However, Coach is too reluctant to tell her about Roy because she appears to like him and wants her father's blessings. To make matters worse, at Melville's restaurant, Roy forces her to pay for dinner herself, which makes Coach angrier. Therefore, witnessing Roy's treatment on her, Coach's friends convince him to tell Lisa about Roy before it is too late. No longer able to keep his silence, Coach escorts Lisa into an office, admits to Lisa that she is too good for someone who treats her badly, like Roy, and openly refuses to let her marry him. Lisa admits that she knows everything about Roy and that Roy wants to marry her merely for business reasons. Then Lisa reluctantly tells Coach that, despite all that, she wants to have a family of her own, that Roy is the first man in her life to propose to her, and that she fears Roy will be the last. Coach is shocked with disbelief and tells her that she's \\"beautiful\\", but Lisa objects and begs him for one moment to analyze her physical appearance, which she is insecure about. Coach then realizes and tells Lisa that she resembles her mother.Coach's wife died before the show premiered in 1982. Lisa agrees, saying that her mother was not \\"comfortable about her [own] beauty.\\" Coach tells Lisa that she is more beautiful every day, regardless of her appearance, just as her mother was more beautiful every day. Lisa, feeling self-confident from her talk with Coach, tells Roy that she does not want to marry him because she finds him \\"more and more obnoxious.\\" Roy vows that he will be \\"gone\\" as he exits the bar. Lisa prepares to celebrate her freedom from Roy with Coach, as they leave the bar. Meanwhile, Diane (Shelley Long) draws sketches of people, but her efforts show no resemblance to their subjects.  Production  Ken Levine remarked that the whole audience laughed during the filming of an office scene between Coach and his daughter at the end of the episode. It was reshot but the audience still laughed. Glen and Les Charles decided to lift the laughter from the office scene, so it is not heard in the final cut.Levine, Ken. \\"\\". ...by Ken Levine April 24, 2011. Web. June 8, 2012.

Until 2019, the asteroid's modelled orbit placed it at risk of a possible future collision with Earth in 2185. It had the third highest cumulative impact threat of all known asteroids on the Palermo Technical Impact Hazard Scale based on its estimated diameter of 160 meters, kinetic yield, impact probability, and time interval.Sentry Risk Table Observations to 2019 have extended the observation arc by four years and detected a favourable Yarkovsky effect, which rules out impact in 2185.  Discovery was initially announced as discovered on 16 March 2009 by La Sagra Sky Survey. Because there were previous observations found in images taken by the Spacewatch survey some 3 weeks prior, on 24 February 2009, the Minor Planet Center assigned the discovery credit to Spacewatch under the discovery assignment rules. made a close pass to Earth on 27 March 2009 at a distance of Near Earth Asteroid 2009 FD - whilst you were sleeping!

The October‚ÄìNovember 2015 Earth approach was studied by the Goldstone Deep Space Network.  Binary  NASA's Near Earth Program originally estimated its size to be 130 metres in diameter based on an assumed albedo of 0.15. This gave it an estimated mass of around 2,800,000 tonnes. But work by Amy Mainzer using NEOWISE data in 2014 showed that it could be as large as 472 metres with an albedo as low as 0.01. Because (K09F00D) was only detected in two (W1 + W2) of the four wavelengths the suspected NEOWISE diameter is more of an upper limit. Radar observations in 2015 showed it to be a binary asteroid. The primary is 120‚Äì180 meters in diameter and the secondary is 60‚Äì120 meters in diameter.  Future approaches The JPL Small-Body Database shows that will make two very close approaches in the late 22nd century, in 2185 and 2190. As of 2016, the approach of 29 March 2185 had a 1 in 710 chance of impacting Earth. The nominal 2185 Earth approach distance was .

An impact by would cause severe devastation to a large region or tsunamis of significant size.  Past Earth-impact estimates  In January 2011, near- Earth asteroid (with observations through 7 December 2010) was listed on the JPL Sentry Risk Table with a 1 in 435 chance of impacting Earth on 29 March 2185. In 2014 (with observations through 5 February 2014, creating an observation arc of 1807 days) the potential 2185 impact was ruled out. Using the 2014 observations, the Yarkovsky effect has become more significant than the position uncertainties. The Yarkovsky effect has resulted in the 2185 virtual impactor returning. While was estimated to be 470 meters in diameter, it was rated ‚àí0.40 on the Palermo Scale, placing it higher on the Sentry Risk Table than any other known object at the time. On 14 June 2019, Alessio Del Vigna and colleagues published a new analysis, which incorporates astrometry taken in 2019. Using both JPL's Sentry as well as NEODyS's CLOMON-2 system, the new data allowed a 4-sigma detection of the Yarkovsky effect at . The 2019 observations extended the observation arc from six years to ten years. This ruled out the 2185 impact possibility, leaving the potential impact in 2190 as the only theoretically possible impact until 2250, at a very low probability of 1 in 100 million.

The first commander of the Indonesian National Armed Forces, he continues to be widely respected in the country. Born in Purbalingga, Dutch East Indies, Sudirman moved to Cilacap in 1916 and was raised by his uncle. A diligent student at a Muhammadiyah-run school, he became respected within the community for his devotion to Islam. After dropping out of teacher's college, in 1936 he began working as a teacher, and later headmaster, at a Muhammadiyah-run elementary school. After the Japanese occupied the Indies in 1942, Sudirman continued to teach, before joining the Japanese-sponsored Defenders of the Homeland as a battalion commander in Banyumas in 1944. In this position he put down a rebellion by his fellow soldiers, but was later interned in Bogor. After Indonesia proclaimed its independence on 17 August 1945, Sudirman led a break-out then went to Jakarta to meet President Sukarno. Tasked with overseeing the surrender of Japanese soldiers in Banyumas, he established a division of the People's Safety Body there. On 12 November 1945, at an election to decide the military's commander- in-chief in Yogyakarta, Sudirman was chosen over Oerip Soemohardjo in a close vote. While waiting to be confirmed, Sudirman ordered an assault on British and Dutch forces in Ambarawa. The ensuing battle and British withdrawal strengthened Sudirman's popular support, and he was ultimately confirmed on 18 December. During the following three years Sudirman saw negotiations with the returning Dutch colonial forces fail, first after the Linggadjati Agreement ‚Äì which Sudirman participated in drafting ‚Äì and then the Renville Agreement; he was also faced with internal dissent, including a 1948 coup d'√©tat attempt. He later blamed these issues for his tuberculosis, which led to his right lung being collapsed in November 1948. On 19 December 1948, several days after Sudirman's release from the hospital, the Dutch launched an assault on the capital. Sudirman and a small contingent escaped Dutch forces and left the city, making their headquarters at Sobo, near Mount Lawu. There Sudirman commanded military activities throughout Java, including a show of force in Yogyakarta on 1 March 1949. When the Dutch began withdrawing, in July 1949 Sudirman was recalled to Yogyakarta and forbidden to fight further. In late 1949 Sudirman's tuberculosis relapsed, and he retired to Magelang, where he died slightly more than a month after the Dutch recognised Indonesia's independence. He is buried at Semaki Heroes' Cemetery in Yogyakarta. Sudirman's death was grieved throughout Indonesia, with flags flown at half- mast and thousands gathering to see his funeral convoy and procession. He continues to be highly respected in Indonesia. His guerrilla campaign has been credited with developing the army's esprit de corps, and the long route he took must be followed by Indonesian cadets before graduation. Sudirman featured prominently on the 1968 series of rupiah banknotes, and has numerous streets, museums, and monuments named after him. On 10 December 1964, he was declared a National Hero of Indonesia. Early life Sudirman was born to Karsid Kartawiraji (father) and Siyem while they lived with Siyem's sister Tarsem, one of three women married to the sub-district head Raden Cokrosunaryo, in Rembang, Bodas Karangjati, Purbalingga, Dutch East Indies. According to the family's records, Sudirman ‚Äì named by his uncle ‚Äì was born on a pon Sunday in the month of Maulud in the Javanese calendar; the Indonesian government later established 24 January 1916 as Sudirman's birthday. As Cokrosunaryo was in a better financial situation, he adopted Sudirman and gave him the title Raden, reserved for Javanese nobility; however, Sudirman was not told that Cokrosunaryo was not his birth father until he was eighteen. When Cokrosunaryo retired from his position as chief in late 1916, Sudirman went with the family to Manggisan, Cilacap, where he was raised. In Cilacap Karsid and Siyem had another son, Muhammad Samingan. Karsid died when Sudirman was six, at which time Siyem left the boys with her brother-in-law and went back to her village at Parakan Onje, Ajibarang. Sudirman was raised with stories of heroic deeds and taught the etiquette and ways of the priyayi, or noble caste, as well as the work ethic and simplicity of the wong cilik, or commoners. For his religious education, he studied Islam under Kyai Hajji Qahar with his brother; Sudirman was a religious child, and always prayed on time. He was soon entrusted with performing both the adhan and iqama, or calls to prayer. When he was seven years old, Sudirman was enrolled at a school for natives (), where he was an average student. The family, although it had enough to live by, was not rich. During his tenure as sub-district head, Cokrosunaryo had not accumulated much wealth, and in Cilacap he became a distributor of Singer sewing machines. In his fifth year of school, Sudirman asked to leave his studies, concerned with the ridicule he faced at the government-run school; this request was at first refused, but Sudirman was transferred to a junior high school run by Taman Siswa in his seventh year of school. In his eighth year, Sudirman transferred to Wirotomo Junior High School after the Taman Siswa School was found to be unregistered and closed under the Wild School Ordinance. Many of Sudirman's teachers at Wirotomo were Indonesian nationalists, which influenced his views of the Dutch colonists. Sudirman studied diligently at school; his teacher Suwarjo Tirtosupono later recalled that Sudirman would already be studying second-term lessons while the class was still in term one. Although he performed poorly in Javanese calligraphy, Sudirman was strong in mathematics, science, and writing in both Dutch and Indonesian. Sudirman also became more religious under the guidance of his teacher Raden Mohamad Kholil; his classmates named him \\"hajji\\" because of his devotion to his prayers, and Sudirman took up preaching to other students. Aside from his studies and religious activities, Sudirman also served in the school's musical troupe and on the football team, on which he was a defender. Although Cokrosunaryo's death in 1934 left the family poor, Sudirman was allowed to continue his studies without paying until he graduated later that year; after his step-father's death, Sudirman also devoted more time to studying the Sunnah and prayer. By age 19, Sudirman had become a pupil teacher at Wirotomo. Muhammadiyah While at Wirotomo Sudirman was a member of the Wirotomo Student Union, drama club, and band. He helped establish a branch of the Hizboel Wathan, an organisation similar to the Boy Scouts, which was run by the Islamic establishment Muhammadiyah. Sudirman became the leader of the Cilacap division after graduating from Wirotomo; he was tasked with deciding and planning his groups' activities. He emphasised the need for religious studies, insisting that the contingents from Cilacap attend Muhammadiyah conferences throughout Java. He taught the younger members about the history of Islam and the importance of morality, while with older members he enforced near-military discipline. Teaching Sudirman and his wife Alfiah with their youngest son, 1949 After graduating from Wirotomo, Sudirman spent a year at a Muhammadiyah-run teacher's college in Surakarta, but later dropped out owing to a lack of funds. In 1936 he returned to Cilacap to teach at a Muhammadiyah- run elementary school, having been trained by his teachers at Wirotomo; that year he married Alfiah, a former schoolmate and the daughter of the rich batik merchant Raden Sastroatmojo. After the marriage Sudirman lived at his father- in-law's house in Cilacap so he could save money for his own home. The couple went on to have three sons, Ahmad Tidarwono, Muhammad Teguh Bambang Tjahjadi, and Taufik Effendi, and four daughters, Didi Praptiastuti, Didi Sutjiati, Didi Pudjiati, and Titi Wahjuti Satyaningrum. As a teacher, Sudirman taught his students lessons on morality using examples from the lives of the prophets and traditional wayang stories. One of his students later recalled that Sudirman was an even-handed and patient teacher who would mix humour and nationalism in his lessons; this made him popular with the students. A hard-working teacher despite poor pay, within several years Sudirman had become headmaster despite not having a teacher's certificate. As a result, his monthly wages quadrupled from three gulden to twelve and a half. As headmaster, Sudirman worked on numerous administrative duties, including finding middle ground between feuding teachers. A coworker later recalled that Sudirman was a moderate, democratic leader. He was also active in fundraising, both for the needs of his school and the construction of others. During this time Sudirman also continued to serve as a member of the Muhammadiyah Youth Group. Within the group he was known as a keen negotiator and mediator, working to resolve issues between members; he also preached at the local mosque. He was elected as Chair of the Banyumas District of the Muhammadiyah Youth Group at the end of 1937. In this role he enacted policies facilitating members' studies and activities, both religious and secular. He was later put in charge of Youth Group activities throughout Central Java and spent much of his free time travelling and preaching Islam, putting an emphasis on self-awareness. Alfiah was also active in Muhammadiyah-sponsored activities through the group's branch for women, Nasyiatul Aisyiyah. Japanese occupation Governor-General Tjarda van Starkenborgh Stachouwer and General Hein ter Poorten, brought into an internment camp; the two capitulated to invading Japanese forces on 9 March 1942, leading to a three-year long occupation. When World War II broke out in Europe, it was expected that the Japanese, who had already made aggressive moves against mainland China, would try to invade the Indies. In response, the Dutch colonial government ‚Äì which had previously limited military training for native Indonesians ‚Äì began teaching the populace how to deal with air raids. To co-ordinate the preparations, the Dutch formed Air Raid Preparation teams. Sudirman, respected in the community, was asked to lead the Cilacap chapter. Aside from teaching local citizens the safety procedures for dealing with an air raid, Sudirman established watchposts throughout the area. He and the Dutch would also have passing aircraft drop materials to simulate a bombing run; this was intended to improve response time. After the Japanese began occupying the Indies in early 1942, winning several battles against Dutch and Dutch-trained forces of the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army (, or KNIL), on 9 March 1942 Governor-General Tjarda van Starkenborgh Stachouwer and head of the KNIL General Hein ter Poorten capitulated. This brought drastic changes in the governance of the archipelago and reduced the quality of life for non- Japanese in the Indies, many of whom suffered from widespread human rights violations at the hands of the Japanese. In Cilacap, Sudirman's school had been closed and turned into a military outpost; this was part of a widespread effort to close private schools. After Sudirman convinced the Japanese to reopen the school, he and the other teachers were forced to use substandard supplies. Sudirman was also involved in several social and humanitarian organisations during this period, including as chair of the Indonesian People's Cooperative. This brought him greater recognition among the people of Cilacap. Pembela Tanah Air In early 1944, after a year as a representative at the Japanese-run regency council board (Syu Sangikai), Sudirman was asked to join the Defenders of the Homeland (, or PETA); the Japanese occupation government had established PETA in October 1943 to help repel any Allied invasion, and were focused on recruiting younger men, those who had \\"not yet been 'contaminated by Dutch rule. After a few days of hesitance, caused in part by a knee injury he had occurred as a youth, Sudirman agreed to begin training in Bogor. Owing to his standing in the community, Sudirman was made a commander (daidanco) and trained with other persons of that rank. Trained by Japanese officers and soldiers, the cadets were armed with confiscated Dutch equipment. After four months of training Sudirman was put in charge of the battalion stationed at Kroya, Banyumas, Central Java, not far from Cilacap. Sudirman's time as a PETA commander passed uneventfully until 21 April 1945, when PETA troops under the command of Kusaeri began to rebel against the Japanese. Ordered to stop the rebellion, Sudirman agreed to do so only if the PETA rebels would not be harmed, and places harbouring them not razed; this condition was accepted by the Japanese commander, and Sudirman and his troops began searching for the rebels. Although Kusaeri's men initially shot at the commander, after Sudirman used a loudspeaker to tell them they would not be harmed, they backed down. Kusaeri surrendered on 25 April. This garnered support for Sudirman within the occupation forces, although several high-ranking Japanese officers expressed concern over Sudirman's support for Indonesian independence. Sudirman and his men were soon sent to a camp in Bogor, ostensibly for training; however, they were tasked with hard labour as a way to prevent a further uprising, and rumours circulated that the PETA officers would be killed. National revolution=Commander of the Armed Forces The first dedicated TKR headquarters, located in Gondokusuman, Yogyakarta; it is now the Dharma Wiratama Museum. Sudirman taking the oath for becoming the commander of the Armed Forces in-front of Sukarno in 1947 After news of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki reached the Indies in early August 1945, followed by the proclamation of Indonesian independence on 17 August, it was evident that Japanese control was weakening. Sudirman led a break out from the camp in Bogor. Although his fellow internees wanted to attack the Japanese soldiers, Sudirman convinced them against it. After ordering the others to their hometowns, Sudirman made his way to Jakarta and met with President Sukarno, who asked him to lead resistance against Japanese forces in the city. Unfamiliar with Jakarta, Sudirman refused, instead offering to lead forces in Kroya. He left for his former command on 19 August 1945. At the same time, Allied forces were in the process of retaking the Indonesian archipelago for the Netherlands. The first British forces arrived on 8 September 1945. In late August, Sukarno established the People's Safety Bureau (, or BKR), which united troops from the former PETA, Heih≈ç, and KNIL. The BKR served mostly as a police organisation, partly because the political leadership were intent on using diplomacy to garner international recognition of the new country and partly to avoid appearing overly aggressive to the Japanese forces still in the archipelago. Sudirman and several of his fellow PETA soldiers formed a BKR branch in Banyumas in late August, after stopping at Kroya and discovering that his battalion had been disbanded. In a meeting with the Japanese commander for the region, Saburo Tamura, and the resident of Banyumas, Iwashige, Sudirman and Iskak Cokroadisuryo forced the Japanese to surrender and hand over their weapons while a crowd of armed Indonesians encircled the Japanese camp. Many of these weapons were later used by Sudirman's BKR unit, making it one of the best equipped in the country; surplus weapons were distributed to other battalions. As the newly independent nation did not yet have a professional military, on 5 October 1945 Sukarno passed a decree establishing the People's Security Armed Forces ( or TKR, now known as the ). Most officers were former KNIL officers, while rank-and-file soldiers were mostly PETA and Heih≈ç personnel. As the decreed Commander of the Armed Forces, Soeprijadi, failed to come forward, chief of staff Lieutenant General Oerip Soemohardjo served as an interim leader. That October British-led forces, tasked with disarming Japanese troops and repatriating Dutch prisoners of war, arrived in Semarang, then made their way south to Magelang. When the British began rearming repatriated Dutch prisoners and seemed to be preparing a military base in Magelang, Sudirman ‚Äì now a colonel ‚Äì sent some of his troops under Lieutenant Colonel Isdiman to drive them away; the mission was successful, and the European soldiers withdrew to Ambarawa, midway between Magelang and Semarang. On 20 October Sudirman was put in command of the Fifth Division, after Oerip began dividing Java into different military commands. On 12 November 1945, at the first general meeting of Army leadership, Sudirman was elected Commander of the Armed Forces (Panglima Besar) following two deadlocked votes. In the third round, Oerip had 21 votes to Sudirman's 22; the division commanders from Sumatra voted unanimously for Sudirman and swayed the ballot in his favour. Sudirman, aged 29 at the time, was surprised at his selection and offered to relinquish the leadership position to Oerip, but the meeting did not allow it. Oerip himself, who had lost control of the meeting prior to the vote, was glad to no longer be in charge of the entire Army. Sudirman kept Oerip to serve as chief of staff under him. In accordance with his new role, Sudirman was promoted to general. After the meeting, Sudirman returned to Banyumas to await confirmation as leader of the TKR and began developing strategies on how repel Allied advances. The Indonesians feared that the Dutch, through the Netherlands Indies Civil Administration (, or NICA), would attempt to retake the archipelago; soldiers of the Dutch-British alliance had landed in Java in September, and a large battle had occurred in Surabaya during late October and early November. This instability, as well as Sukarno's uncertainty about Sudirman's qualifications, led to a delay in Sudirman's confirmation. While waiting for his appointment to be confirmed, in late November Sudirman ordered the Fifth Division to attack Allied forces stationed in Ambarawa, once again with Isdiman in charge; the city was considered strategically important owing to its military barracks and training facilities dating from the colonial period. This assault was countered by an air strike and the use of tanks, which forced the division to retreat; Isdiman died in the battle, killed by a strafing P-51 Mustang Sudirman then led the Division in another assault against Allied forces; the Indonesian troops were armed with a variety of weapons, ranging from bamboo spears and confiscated katanas to rifles, while the British were armed with modern equipment. Sudirman led from the front, wielding a katana. The Allies, whose air support had been cut off when guerrilla soldiers attacked Kalibanteng Airfield in Semarang, were forced onto the defensive and holed up in Willem Fortress. On 12 December Sudirman led a four-day siege, which resulted in the Allied force withdrawing to Semarang. Sudirman, early 1946 The Battle of Ambarawa brought Sudirman greater attention at a national level, and generally silenced whispers that he was unfit for military command because of his lack of military experience and previous employment as a schoolteacher. Ultimately, Sudirman was chosen as his loyalty was undoubted, while Oerip's former pledge of loyalty to the Dutch led to him being viewed with suspicion. Sudirman was confirmed as commander of the Armed Forces on 18 December 1945. He was replaced as head of the Fifth Division by Colonel Sutiro, and began to focus on strategic problems. This was done partly by establishing a board of advisors, which gave the general advice on both political and military issues. Oerip handled many of the military matters. Together, Sudirman and Oerip were able to reduce the differences and mistrust between former KNIL and PETA troops, although some troops were reluctant to be subordinated to a central command, instead choosing to follow their popularly selected battalion commanders. The government renamed the Army twice in January 1946, first to the Peoples' Salvation Armed Forces (), then to the Republic of Indonesia Military Forces (, or TRI/RIMF). This was followed by the formal establishment of a navy and air force in early 1946. In the meantime, the Indonesian government had moved from Jakarta ‚Äì now under Dutch control ‚Äì to Yogyakarta in January; delegates led by Prime Minister Sutan Sjahrir spent much of April and May unsuccessfully negotiating for Dutch recognition of Indonesian sovereignty. On 25 May Sudirman was reconfirmed as commander of the Armed Forces of the expanded military, after its reorganisation. At the ceremony, Sudirman swore to protect the republic \\"until he shed his last drop of blood.\\" The leftist Minister of Defence Amir Sjarifuddin, who had received greater power in the reorganisation, began collecting socialist and communist troops under his direct control, as well as leftist paramilitary units () that were funded by and loyal to the various political parties. The minister instituted political education programmes in the army, which were meant to spread leftist ideology. This use of the military for political manoeverings disappointed both Sudirman and Oerip, who were at the time busy ensuring equal treatment for soldiers from different military backgrounds. However, rumours among the populace had spread that Sudirman was preparing for a coup d'√©tat; although an attempt did occur in early July 1946, Sudirman's role, if any, is not certain. In July Sudirman addressed these rumours through a speech broadcast on Radio Republik Indonesia (RRI), stating that he, like all Indonesians, was a servant of the State, and that, if he were offered the presidency, he would refuse it. In his later career he stated that the military had no place in politics, and vice versa. Negotiations with the Dutch Sudirman arriving in Jakarta on 1 November 1946 Meanwhile, Sjahrir continued to work on negotiations with the Allied forces. On 7 October 1946, Sjahrir and the former Dutch Prime Minister, Wim Schermerhorn, agreed to work towards a ceasefire. The discussions were to be moderated by the British diplomat Lord Killearn and involved Sudirman. He took a specially commissioned train to Jakarta, departing on 20 October. However, he ordered it to return to Yogyakarta when Dutch troops refused to allow him and his men to enter the city with their weapons, feeling that such an order violated his sense of honour; the Dutch apologised, construing the events as a misunderstanding. Sudirman took another train in late October, arriving at Gambir Station in Jakarta on 1 November, where he was greeted by large crowds. The discussions in Jakarta resulted in the drafting of the Linggadjati Agreement on 15 November; the agreement was ratified on 25 March 1947, despite heavy opposition from Indonesian nationalists. Sudirman was vocally against the agreement, which he found to be detrimental to Indonesian interests, but considered himself obliged to follow his orders. In early 1947, with the Linggadjati Agreement granting relative peace, Sudirman began work on consolidating the TKR with various laskar. As part of a committee, Sudirman began reorganising the military; they reached an agreement in May 1947, and on 3 June 1947 the Indonesian National Armed Forces (, or TNI) was formalised; it consisted of TKR forces and various laskar groups, which Sudirman had included only after realising the extent of their manipulation by the political parties. However, the ceasefire obtained through the Linggadjati Agreement was not long lasting. On 21 July 1947 the Dutch forces ‚Äì which had occupied areas left by the British during their withdrawal ‚Äì launched Operation Product, and quickly gained control of large swaths of Java and Sumatra; the national government in Yogyakarta remained untouched. Sudirman called the army to fight, using the code \\"Ibu Pertiwi is calling! Ibu Pertiwi is calling!\\", and later delivered several speeches over RRI in an unsuccessful attempt to encourage soldiers to fight against the Dutch. However, the Indonesian soldiers were unprepared and their lines crumbled quickly. The Van Mook Line, with areas under Indonesian control in red; in 1947 Sudirman was forced to recall over 35,000 troops from Dutch-held areas. Pressured by the United Nations, which had looked at the situation in the former East Indies with disdain, on 29 August 1947 the Dutch established the Van Mook Line, which divided Dutch and Indonesian-controlled areas. Along this line a ceasefire was called. Sudirman recalled the Indonesian guerrillas hiding in Dutch-held lands, ordering them to return to Indonesian-held areas. To keep their spirits up, he referred to the withdrawal as a hijrah, reminiscent of Muhammad's migration to Medina in 622 AD, implying that they would return. Over 35,000 troops left western Java at this order, travelling to Yogyakarta by train and ship. This boundary was formalised by the Renville Agreement on 17 January 1948; among the signatories was Amir Sjarifuddin, by then also serving as prime minister. Meanwhile, Sjarifuddin began rationalising the army, cutting back on the number of troops. At the time the regular army consisted of 350,000 men, with a further 470,000 in the laskar. In this programme, by presidential decree Sudirman was no longer commander-in-chief of the military starting on 2 January 1948. He was demoted to lieutenant general, while Chief of the Air Force Soerjadi Soerjadarma was intended to be commander-in-chief. Shortly afterwards, Sjarifuddin was ousted in a vote of no confidence for his involvement in the Renville Agreement, and the new prime minister, Mohammad Hatta, worked to implement the rationalisation programme. This led to a several months-long debate between pro- and anti-rationalisation groups. Sudirman served as a rallying point and driving force for soldiers, including numerous older commanders, who were against the programme. Sudirman was formally reinstated on 1 June 1946, upon which he effectively rescinded the command to rationalise. He chose Colonel Abdul Haris Nasution as his deputy, but remained a lieutenant general. As the rationalisation programme was winding down, Sjarifuddin began gathering soldiers from the Socialist Party, Communist Party, and members of the All Indonesia Centre of Labour Organizations for a would-be proletarian revolution in Madiun, East Java, which occurred on 18 September 1948. Sudirman, ill at the time, sent Nasution to deal with the revolution; Sudirman also sent two other officers as peace feelers before the attacks. Although the revolutionary leader Muso was amenable to peace, Nasution and his soldiers had quashed the uprising by 30 September. Sudirman visited Madiun not long after the battle, later telling his wife that he had been unable to sleep there for all the bloodshed. Panti Rapih Hospital (pictured c. 1956), where Sudirman was treated for tuberculosis This rebellion, and ongoing political instability, sapped Sudirman of much of his remaining strength. On 5 October 1948, after celebrations of the military's third anniversary, Sudirman collapsed. After being examined by numerous doctors, he was diagnosed with tuberculosis. At the end of the month he was brought to Panti Rapih Hospital and had his right lung collapsed, in hope that it would stop the spread of the disease. During his time at the hospital, he delegated most of his duties to Nasution. However, the two continued to discuss plans for the war against the Dutch, and Sudirman continued to receive status reports. They agreed that guerrilla warfare, which had been applied on raids into Dutch-held territory since May, would be best suited for their needs; towards this goal, Sudirman issued a general order on 11 November, with Nasution handling most of the preparations. Sudirman was released from the hospital on 28 November 1948. Although he continued to issue orders, Sudirman only returned to active duty on 17 December; in light of the growing tension between the Dutch and Indonesian forces, he ordered the TNI soldiers to maintain an increased level of awareness; he also ordered large- scale military exercises as a in an unsuccessful attempt to convince the Dutch that the TNI was too strong to attack. Two days later, after a nighttime announcement that they were no longer bound by the Renville Agreement, on 19 December the Dutch launched Operation Kraai, an attempt to capture the capital at Yogyakarta. By 07:10 local time (UTC+7), the airfield at Maguwo had been taken by paratroopers under the command of Captain Eekhout. Sudirman, upon becoming aware of the attack, had an order read over RRI which stated that soldiers should fight as they had been trained ‚Äì as guerrillas. He then went to the Presidential Palace in central Yogyakarta, where the government leaders were discussing an ultimatum which stated that the city would be stormed unless the leadership accepted colonial rule. Sudirman urged that the president and vice-president leave the city and fight as guerrillas, actions they had previously promised, but this suggestion was rejected. Although his doctors forbade it, Sudirman received permission from Sukarno to join his men. The central government evacuated to the Kraton Ngayogyakarta Hadiningrat at the urging of Sultan Hamengkubuwana IX, but were captured and exiled. Guerrilla warfare Sudirman first went to his official home and gathered sensitive documents, which he burned to prevent them falling into Dutch hands. His convoy, consisting of Sudirman, a small group of soldiers, and his personal doctor, then made their way south, towards Kretek, Parangtritis, Bantul. There they were received by the district head at 18:00. After several days in Kretek, during which time Sudirman sent undercover troops into the Dutch-occupied city for reconnaissance and to ask his wife for jewellery to sell and help fund the guerrilla movement, he and his group travelled east along the south coast to Wonogiri. Before the Dutch attack it had already been decided that Sudirman would be able to better control the guerrillas from eastern Java, where there were still several bases. Meanwhile, Alfiah and the children were ordered to stay in the Kraton. Aware that he was being pursued by the Dutch, on 23 December Sudirman ordered his troops to continue to Ponorogo, where they stopped at the home of Mahfuz, a kyai and Islamic religious leader; Mahfuz gave the general a cane to help him walk, although Sudirman was, and continued to be, carried on a litter. They then continued east. Sudirman, surrounded by his guerrillas during their campaign Outside of Trenggalek, Sudirman and his group were stopped by TNI soldiers belonging to 102 Battalion. These soldiers, who were told that Sudirman ‚Äì who was in civilian clothes and unrecognised by the troops holding them ‚Äì had been taken prisoner, refused to allow the group to pass; they were suspicious as Sudirman's convoy carried maps and notes on Indonesian military movements, things which may have belonged to spies. When the group's commander, Major Zainal Fanani, came to check the situation, he realised that Sudirman was with them and apologised. Told that his men were right to guard their areas diligently, Fanani called a post in Kediri and ordered that a car be sent to pick up the general and his troops. After a time in Kediri, they continued further east; as they left the city on 24 December, Dutch planes attacked Kediri. The constant Dutch attacks led Sudirman, perhaps at the suggestion of one of his men, to change his clothes and give his old outfit to one of his soldiers, Second Lieutenant Heru Kesser ‚Äì who bore a resemblance to Sudirman. Kesser was ordered to head south with a large company of soldiers, remove the clothes, and furtively return north, while Sudirman waited in Karangnongko. The diversion was successful, and on 27 December Sudirman and his men made their way to Jambu Village. Arriving on 9 January 1949, Sudirman met with several government ministers who had not been present during the Dutch attack on Yogyakarta: Supeno, Susanto Tirtoprojo, and Susilowati. With the politicians, Sudirman made his way to Banyutuwo, ordering some of his soldiers to linger back and hold off Dutch ground troops. In Banyutuwo, they held for over a week. However, on 21 January, when Dutch forces approached the village, Sudirman and his entourage were forced to leave, fighting their way out in heavy rain. Sudirman and his troops continued to make their way through the jungles and forests, eventually arriving at Sobo, near Mount Lawu, on 18 February. During the journey, Sudirman used a radio set to convey orders to local TNI troops if he believed that the region was secure. Feeling weaker because of the physical hardships he had faced, including travelling through the forests and a lack of food, and believing the area to be safe, Sudirman decided that Sobo would serve as his guerrilla headquarters. The local commander, Lieutenant Colonel Wiliater Hutagalung, served as his go-between with the other TNI leaders. Aware that international opinion, which was beginning to condemn Dutch actions in Indonesia, could bring Indonesia greater recognition, Sudirman and Hutagalung discussed possible terms of action, before agreeing on a large-scale assault. Meanwhile, the Dutch began to spread propaganda claiming that they had captured Sudirman; this claim was intended to break the morale of the guerrillas. Sudirman ordered Hutagalung to begin planning a full-scale assault, in which TNI soldiers ‚Äì in uniform ‚Äì would attack the Dutch and show their strength in front of foreign reporters and United Nations investigative teams. Hutagalung, together with officers under his commander Colonel Bambang Sugeng and government officials under Governor Wongsonegoro, spent several days discussing ways to ensure the attack could be successful. The discussion may have resulted in the General Offensive of 1 March 1949, which saw TNI soldiers attack Dutch outposts throughout central Java. Troops under Lieutenant Colonel Suharto retook Yogyakarta for six hours before withdrawing, a successful show of force which caused the Dutch to lose face internationally; they had previously declared the TNI eradicated. However, who truly ordered the offensive remains uncertain: Suharto and Hamengkubuwana IX claimed responsibility, while Bambang Sugeng's brother reportedly overheard him ordering the assault. Sudirman (left) being embraced by President Sukarno upon his return to Yogyakarta. Under increased pressure from the United Nations, on 7 May 1949 Dutch‚ÄìIndonesian negotiations resulted in the Roem‚ÄìVan Roijen Agreement, a controversial measure which guaranteed Dutch withdrawal from Yogyakarta, among other points; The Dutch withdrawal commenced in late June, and the Indonesian leadership began returning to Yogyakarta from exile in early July. Sukarno ordered Sudirman to return to Yogyakarta as well, but Sudirman refused to let the Dutch withdraw without a fight; he considered the TNI to now be strong enough to defeat the dispirited Dutch. Although he was promised medicine and support in Yogyakarta, Sudirman refused to return to the political leadership, whom he considered acquiescent to the Dutch. He only agreed to return after receiving a letter, although sources disagree on its sender. On 10 July, Sudirman and his group returned to Yogyakarta, where they were greeted by thousands of civilians and warmly received by the political elite there. The reporter Rosihan Anwar, who was present when the letter was delivered, wrote in 1973 that \\"Sudirman had to return to Yogyakarta to avoid any perceptions of a rift among the republic's top leaders\\". Post-war and death In early August Sudirman approached Sukarno and asked him to continue the guerrilla war; Sudirman did not expect the Dutch to abide by the Roem-Royen Agreement, based on the failings of the previous agreements. Sukarno disagreed, which was a blow to Sudirman. When Sudirman threatened to resign his post, blaming the government's inconsistency for his tuberculosis and Oerip's death in November 1948, Sukarno threatened to do so as well. As he thought that such a resignation would have a destabilising effect, Sudirman stayed his hand, and a Java-wide cease fire came into effect on 11 August 1949. Continuing to suffer from tuberculosis, Sudirman was checked into Panti Rapih hospital, where he stayed until October, when he was transferred to a sanatorium in nearby Pakem. As a result of his illness, Sudirman made few public appearances. Sudirman was transferred to a home in Magelang in December. In the meantime, the Indonesian and Dutch governments held a several-month-long conference which resulted in Dutch recognition of Indonesian sovereignty on 27 December 1949. Sudirman, despite his illness, was reconfirmed that day as commander-in-chief of the TNI, now serving the newly established Republic of the United States of Indonesia. On 28 December, Jakarta once again became the nation's capital. Sudirman's casket being carried by soldiers Sudirman died in Magelang at 18:30 on 29 January 1950; this was reported in a special broadcast over RRI. Upon receiving news of his death, the Sudirman family home received numerous visitors, including the entirety of the 9th Brigade, which was stationed nearby. The following morning Sudirman's body was brought to Yogyakarta. As the funeral convoy passed, led by four tanks and consisting of eighty motor vehicles, thousands of mourners stood at the sides of the streets. The convoy was organised by members of the 9th Brigade. The viewing, held at the Great Mosque of Yogyakarta in the afternoon, was attended by numerous political and military elite from both Indonesia and foreign countries; this included Prime Minister Abdul Halim, Minister of Defence Hamengkubuwana IX, Minister of Health Johannes Leimena, Minister of Justice Abdoel Gaffar Pringgodigdo, Minister of Information Arnold Mononutu, Chief of the Air Force Soerjadi Soerjadarma, Colonel Paku Alam VIII, and Suharto. The viewing was closed with a 24-gun salute. Sudirman's body was brought to Semaki Heroes' Cemetery on foot, with a crowd of mourners long trailing behind. He was interred next to Oerip, after another gun salute. His wife filled in the first scoop of dirt, followed by the government ministers. The national government ordered flags to be flown at half-mast throughout the country, and Sudirman was promoted to full general. Major-General Tahi Bonar Simatupang was selected as the new leader of the armed forces. Sudirman's memoirs were published later that year; a series of his speeches were also published in 1970. Legacy Sudirman's grave at Semaki Heroes' Cemetery in Yogyakarta; it has become a pilgrimage destination. An obituary in the Yogyakarta-based daily Kedaulatan Rakjat wrote that Indonesia had lost a \\"brave and true hero\\". Colonel Paku Alam VIII, in charge of the Yogyakarta area, told the national news agency Antara that all Indonesians, especially the armed forces, had \\"lost a father figure who did uncountable deeds for his country\\". The Indonesian Muslim leader Haji Abdul Malik Karim Amrullah, writing soon after Sudirman's death, described the general as a \\"symbol of the strength of spirit shown by Indonesian heroes,\\" while the Muslim politician Muhammad Isa Anshary described Sudirman as a \\"son of the revolution, as he was born in the revolution, and raised by the revolution.\\" In a radio speech, Hatta described Sudirman as impossible to control and hard-headed, but ultimately intent on doing what was right for the country; Hatta noted that, although Sudirman often did not like the government's position, he would generally obey his orders. However, Hamengkubuwana IX noted that KNIL trained soldiers such as Abdul Haris Nasution and Tahi Bonar Simatupang were disappointed in Sudirman because of his background and poor knowledge of military techniques. Modern opinions in Indonesia tend to be laudatory. Sardiman, a professor of history at Yogyakarta State University, writes that Sudirman was as lively a speaker as Sukarno, who was known for his fiery speeches, and a devoted, incorruptible leader. The Indonesian historian and former Minister of Education and Culture Nugroho Notosusanto described Sudirman as \\"his only idol\\", citing the general's guerrilla period as the origin of the army's esprit de corps. The general's guerrilla campaign is emphasised in biographies of him because, during that period, the army had a greater role than the exiled political leadership; beginning in the 1970s, all military cadets had to retrace the long route prior to graduation, a \\"pilgrimage\\" meant to instill a sense of struggle. Sudirman's grave is also a pilgrimage destination, both for the military and general public. According to Katharine McGregor of the University of Melbourne, the Indonesian military has elevated Sudirman to a saint-like status. Sudirman received numerous awards from the national government posthumously, including the Bintang Sakti, Bintang Gerilya, Bintang Mahaputera Adipurna, Bintang Mahaputera Pratama, Bintang Republik Indonesia Adipurna, and Bintang Republik Indonesia Adipradana. On 10 December 1964 Sudirman was declared a National Hero of Indonesia by Presidential Decree 314 of 1964. Oerip was declared a National Hero by the same decree. He was posthumously promoted to General of the Army in 1997. Sudirman on a 5 rupiah banknote, issued in 1968 According to McGregor, the military increasingly used Sudirman's image as a symbol of leadership as it gained more political power. An image of Sudirman was featured on every denomination of the 1968 series of rupiah. He featured as a major character in several war films, including Janur Kuning (Yellow Coconut Leaf; 1979) and Serangan Fajar (Dawn Attack; 1982). Numerous museums have been dedicated to Sudirman. His childhood home in Purbalingga is now the Sudirman Museum, while his official home in Yogyakarta is now the Sasmitaloka Museum to General Sudirman. The house in Magelang where he died is also now the Sudirman Museum, established on 18 May 1967 and containing artefacts belonging to the general. Other museums, including the Monument Yogya Kembali in Yogyakarta and the Satriamandala Museum in Jakarta have rooms dedicated to him. Numerous streets are named after Sudirman, including a major street in Jakarta; McGregor states that nearly every city in the country has a General Sudirman Street. Statues and monuments to him are spread throughout the archipelago, most of which were built after 1970. Jenderal Sudirman University in Banyumas, established in 1963, is named after him.

Tiffany's other National Theatre of Scotland productions included an adaptation of Peter Pan, which played in Glasgow, in April to May 2010, and then toured to London, Inverness, Edinburgh and Aberdeen; a version of The Bacchae, starring Alan Cumming as Dionysus; and Macbeth, as co-director with Andrew Goldberg, in which Cumming played all the roles. His final production as Associate Director was Let the Right One In which premiered in Dundee in 2013. Once James Bond movie producer Barbara Broccoli acquired the stage production rights for Once, which is based on the 2006 musical film by the same name, and subsequently recruited Tiffany to produce it after seeing his Black Watch at St. Ann's Warehouse in Brooklyn. Tiffany collaborated on Once with longtime friend and choreographer Steven Hoggett, with whom he had also worked on Black Watch. Although the two had been close friends since 1987, they did not collaborate until 2003 when they worked on The Straits by Gregory Burke. Once marked their seventh collaboration. Tiffany directed the Off-Broadway and Broadway productions of Once in 2011‚Äì2012. He won the 2012 Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Director of a Musical for his direction of Once. Among the artistic decisions that Hoggett and Tiffany made was the decision to eliminate the choreography from several works including \\"Falling Slowly\\", which won the Academy Award for Best Original Song at the 80th Academy Awards in 2008. He won the Tony Award for Best Direction of a Musical for Once at the 66th Tony Awards. Tiffany also received a 2012 Obie Award special citation (along with Once colleagues Hoggett and Martin Lowe). Once earned 11 Tony Award nominations, more than any other production for the 2011‚Äì12 season. Work 2013 to present In 2013, he directed a production of Tennessee Williams' The Glass Menagerie at the American Repertory Theater, Cambridge, Massachusetts, which transferred to Broadway. The work earned him a second Best direction of a play Tony Award nomination. However, he lost out to Kenny Leon who directed A Raisin in the Sun. In April 2015, his production of Enda Walsh's adaptation of The Twits was described as \\"torture\\" by Telegraph Chief Critic Dominic Cavendish. Tiffany directed the stage play Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. The play opened at the West End Palace Theatre, London on 7 June 2016 in previews and officially on 30 July. Harry Potter and the Cursed Child opened on Broadway on 22 April 2018, again directed by Tiffany.McPhee, Ryan. \\" 'Harry Potter and the Cursed Child' Officially Opens on Broadway April 22\\" Playbill, 22 April 2018 He won the 2018 Tony Award for Best Direction of a Play, 2018 Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Director of a Play, and 2018 Outer Critics Circle Award for Outstanding Director of a Play.

Its nose art and name were based on the male character Baboon McGoon from Al Capp's comic strip, Li'l Abner. On Sunday, October 10, 1943, in the afternoon, the aircraft ran out of fuel while returning to Bassingbourn, and made a belly landing in a wet and muddy sugar beet field near the village of Tannington, Suffolk, England. Its recovery was described in an article in the June 1944 issue of Popular Science magazine, as well as a 1945 article in Flying magazine. The article describes how the aircraft was jacked up in the sugar beet field. Once on its own gear, it was determined that it could be flown out of the field and several weeks of mobile repairs resulted in the engines and propellers being replaced and temporary patches being applied. An 1,800 ft long steel mesh temporary runway allowed the aircraft to depart the sugar beet field in November 1943 and fly to a maintenance depot for more extensive repairs. Squadron records of the 324th BS indicate that Sir Baboon McGoon returned to Bassingbourn on 19 February 1944. It flew seven additional missions between 24 February 1944 and its final mission on 29 March 1944. The 10 man crew for that final mission on March 29, 1944 was headed by 2Lt Edgar C Downing.2Lt Edgar C Downing, ASN O-803789 Most of his crew had flown other missions, and they had flown this particular aircraft on one previous mission since its return to service. The crew members described it as \\"a real crate\\" of an airplane ‚Äì with many patches and quirks. The assigned mission for that day was a bombing run to Brunswick, Germany. As their portion of the formation arrived over the primary target, (also known as Braunschweig), they reported that the target area was obscured by clouds or smoke, so they proceeded to their secondary target. Bombs released from a bomber above them struck one of their engines. (Believed by the crew to be the #4, or right outboard engine.) This shut down one engine, but the propeller couldn't be properly feathered and there was damage to the electrical and/or hydraulic systems. Their troubles mounted when they attempted to drop their bombs and the bomb bay doors had to be manually opened and the bomb's released manually. Once the bombs were gone, they were unable to close the bomb bay doors. The increased drag of a non-feathered propeller and the open bomb bay doors, combined with the lost power from one inoperative engine, caused them to slow down and forced them to fall out of formation. The crew recalls that they were then attacked by German fighter aircraft and they lost one or two more engines and had to drop down to the cloud deck (tops around 5,000') to attempt to continue flying. The aircraft was headed west towards England, but was lower than their formations and unable to keep up. Witness crew members from a 323rd Bomb Squadron aircraft reported losing sight of the missing aircraft about 30 minutes (east of) the Zuider Zee, but that the aircraft was continuing on course, just lower & slower. The witnesses reported that the engines were feathered, but crew statements suggest that the engines were not turning, however the propellers were not feathered either. As the accident aircraft continued westward, the crew was ordered to lighten the load by jettisoning all the extra weight that they could. The ball turret gunner was able to get back into the plane and so they jettisoned the ball turret. One crew member stated that they probably jettisoned any emergency radio they may have had, because they didn't have one in the life rafts. Approximately 4pm and 20 nm west of the coast, they were firmly over the North Sea as darkness approached. They were flying on one sputtering engine, and they had approximately 80 to 90 nm to go to make the English coast. The pilot polled his crew and a unanimous decision was made to attempt a controlled ditching with the limited remaining power, rather than pressing on and facing a forced ditching with no power, quite likely in the dark. Based on previous boating experience, the pilot ditched, but 90 degrees different than the recommended procedure. (Following his return to service, the ditching procedures were changed to match his success method.) A successful ditching was made, and the entire 10 man crew evacuated through the top hatch. They deployed their two 5-man life rafts and pushed away in just in time to watch their aircraft sink in approximately 80 ft of water in the North Sea. The crew recalls that they were cold, sore, injured, and mad. They watched formations of bombers returning to England, and a lone German aircraft came and circled their position once and could have strafed them, but didn't. It appeared to return perhaps an hour later. Struggling to keep their two rafts together in heavy 5' waves, they feared they would freeze or drown in the icy water at approximately 60 degrees N latitude. After darkness fell, they began launching flares every half-hour or so until a boat arrived and rescued them. German records include documents for each of the 10 man crew. These documents are titled \\"Report On Capture of Members of Enemy Air Forces\\" and are shown with a \\"PLACE: 8th E-boat Flotilla, Haarlem\\". Each crew member was reported as being taken POW \\"At sea 28 nautical miles 300 degrees IJmuiden\\" on March 29, 1944 at 2125 (9:25pm). IJmuiden is a coastal city where the Germans had hardened concrete E-boat pens for their Schnellboote (Fast Boats). Larger than an American PT boat, these boats probably were based from IJmuiden and the specific reference of time, distance and direction 28 nm 300 degrees (WNW) from IJmuiden at 2125 hours provides a very specific location. There is a table that estimates the drift rate for a 5-man raft under those wind & wave conditions, which provides a reasonably accurate estimate for the location of the ditching around 4pm, followed by 5 hours and 25 minutes drifting in the rafts. The North Sea is approximately 80' deep at the estimated ditching site. The crew were initially taken to a jail near the streetcar line. Subsequently, they were ordered onto a train and transported to the DuLag (DurchgangsLager) or transfer camp, and about April 1944 the crew had arrived in Luft Stalag 17-B in Krems Austria where they were held POW for just over a year until the end of the war. The June 1944 issue of Popular Science featured the article of the successful restoration of Sir Baboon McGoon from its October 1943 belly landing. By the time the article appeared in print, the aircraft had been on the bottom of the North Sea for at least two months.

Written by Betty Burbridge and Stanley Roberts, the film is about a singing cowboy who takes care of three tough boys sent west from Chicago after their father dies and leaves them a cattle ranch. Plot Following a shootout with lawmen, cattle rustler Jim \\"Legs\\" Barton (William Pawley) with his dying words makes the local sheriff and childhood friend, Gene Autry (Gene Autry), promise to take care of things for him after he's gone. The next day, Barton's attorney, Arthur Dean, informs Gene that, as executor of the estate, he must look after Barton's three motherless boys. Gene sends his sidekick Frog Milhouse (Smiley Burnette) to Chicago to bring the children back, and then prepares the ranch for their homecoming, with the help of Peggy Shaw (Shirley Deane), the local schoolteacher. In Chicago, Frog locates the feisty boys, William \\"Brain\\", Clarence \\"Nails\\", and Hector \\"Slick\\" Barton, who are more than Frog can handle. The boys have trouble adjusting to Western life on the ranch and long to return to the city. While they spy on Gene as he proposes to Peggy at a barn dance, general store owner Frank Welch (Stanley Andrews), Legs's secret partner, leads a cattle rustling raid. The local ranchers chase after the rustlers, but the cattle seem to vanish. The ranchers do not suspect Welch, but when the boys see him riding out from behind a waterfall on their ranch, they realize what has happened. Welch tries to befriend them, saying that their father was his good friend. When the boys tell him about Gene's plan to adopt them, Welch comes up with his own plan. At the adoption hearing, Welch and his wife offer to adopt the Barton boys. Gene agrees to the offer because he is unmarried and the boys say the want to go with Welch. Sometime late, one of the boys has a change of heart, and when he tells Gene what has happened, Gene produces a phony \\"Mrs. Barton\\" and her three children. The judge then rules that Brain, Nails, and Slick are imposters, but Welch detects that the plan is a trick. He plans to do away with the boys and secretly remove the rustled cattle from their ranch. Gene intervenes, however, and Welch and his gang are captured. Afterwards, Gene and Peggy plan to marry and adopt the boys, despite Frog's concern that they will be getting more than they bargained for.

Part O ‚Äì Arthropoda (Trilobitomorpha). 1959 These trilobites were fast-moving low-level epifauna and detritivore. They lived in the Devonian period, from 414 to 391 million years ago.  Distribution  Silurian of China; Silurian to Devonian of Australia and the United States; Devonian of Algeria, Canada, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Kazakhstan, Morocco and Spain.  Description  Odontochile sp., dorsal viewOdontochile is genus of trilobites with a large (about long), moderately vaulted exoskeleton with an inverted egg-shaped outline (about 1.6√ó longer than wide). Its headshield (or cephalon) is semicircular, with long (genal) spines extending from the side of the cephalon back to the tailshield (or pygidium). The frontal margin of the cephalon is semicircular to parabolic, and lacks an anterior extension. The facial suture lies in front of the preglabellar furrow. The frontal lobe of the central raised area of the cephalon (or glabella) is much wider than the other lobes. The frontal lobe is vaulted. The eye is very large, almost touching the lateral and the posterior border furrow. The eye lobe is much higher than the glabella. The \\"seem\\" that is visible from the ventral side (or doublure) is wide and flat, and has a deep and wide. The \\"palate\\" (or hypostome), also only visible from the ventral side, is elongated subtriangular (about 1¬Ω√ó wider than long) and adorned with three prominent spines at its back rim, and two weaker ones more to the side. To the front the hypostome has robust wings extending sideways. The thorax consists of 11 segments. The tips of the segments are leaf-shaped, pointed and angle back at about 30¬∞. The pygidium is large, subtriangular, and about ‚Öî-¬æ√ó as long as wide. The axis is vaulted and 20-25% of the width of the pygidium and consists of 16-20 rings. 13‚Äì14 deep and wide pleural furrows have flat or only slightly concave bottoms. The furrows within each pleural rib (or interpleural furrows) are very narrow. The frontal band of each pleural rib is more vaulted and broader than the rear band. The pleural furrows stay clear of the margin by a distance comparable to that of length (measured along the midline) of an axial ring. The pygidial termination (or mucro) is vaulted and more or less pointed into a short broad- based spine; in derived species this spine is longer. The entire exoskeleton is covered in fine and coarse granules.  Differences with related genera  Reussiana is much like Odontochile, but has a much flatter exoskeleton, 17-21 pygidial axial rings, 15-18 pleural furrows and lacks a medial terminal spine. Zlichovaspis has a subtriangular cephalon with a short median processus, a subtriangular pygidium, and a longer medial terminal spine. In Zlichovaspis (Devonodontochile) the anterior median processus is tongue- shaped, the terminal spine is even longer and slimmer, and uniquely, all elevated parts are perforated by large pores. Dalmanites has genal spines that extend to the 8th thorax segment from the front. The facial suture (almost) coincides with the frontal glabellar furrow. Eye smaller, staying clear of the lateral and posterior border furrows. The hypostome is about as wide as long with three blunt denticles. Tips of the thorax segments point increasingly further backwards as these are situated nearer to the pygidium with the last one pointing parallel to the midline. The pleural furrows of the pygidium almost touch its margin.

All psittacine species are susceptible to Pacheco‚Äôs disease, mainly those in zoological collections and aviaries in any geographic regions. Specifically, Pacheco‚Äôs disease has a high occurrence rate in Amazon parrots, followed by African grey parrots, parrots, macaws, cockatoos and conures. Due to a very high mortality rate within these susceptible species, concerns are brought to companion bird markets and breeders. The main sign of Pacheco‚Äôs disease is a sudden and rapid death of birds. It is often preceded by short, severe illnesses, which includes diarrhoea, lethargy, anorexia and inactivity. The virus is transmitted between birds through ingestion, by contaminated food or water, as well as through inhalation and conjunctival exposure. The rate that the virus can spread is highly influenced by its environment and living conditions. Birds can then develop signs and symptoms weeks after being in contact with the virus. If a bird survives Pacheco‚Äôs disease, it may later develop internal papilloma disease in its gastrointestinal tract. Pacheco‚Äôs disease is diagnosed through a DNA probe or chemical and serological testings. No vaccine directly cures Pacheco‚Äôs disease. There are only treatments with acyclovir and formalin-inactivated vaccine that helps prevent the virus from replicating. The first case of Pacheco‚Äôs disease occurred in Brazil in 1930. Since then, there have been multiple outbreaks globally including in Europe, Japan, Middle East and the U.S. The main source of these outbreaks is mainly due to the importation of birds. Signs and symptoms An uninfected blue-fronted Amazon parrot; one of the vulnerable species to carry and transmit Pacheco's disease Birds infected with Pacheco‚Äôs disease usually experience minor signs and symptoms that appear right before or after its death. Birds can have a watery, yellowish to greenish discolouration of urates and faeces or have moist droppings. They can experience mucoid discharges from its nostrils, such as in blue-and-gold macaws and Amazon parrots, or a regurgitation of clear sanguineous fluids. As the disease progresses, birds can become difficult to arouse, experience lethargy and somnolence as well as lose interest in eating and its normal daily activities. Birds can also display signs of extreme depression only hours before its death. However, due to the short and lack of severe clinical signs indicating a presence of the herpesvirus, the birds that experience a rapid death are found in excellent bodily conditions with full crops. This means that birds often do not live long enough for the collection of its blood for testings or diagnoses. Laboratory tests can also display the abnormalities of tissues, such as a liver with pale yellow to brown patches in necrotic areas. Examinations mainly present lesions in the bird‚Äôs liver and spleen, such as an enlargement of both organs with diffuse patches of necrosis and the bleeding of broken capillaries (petechial haemorrhage). There can also be minimal to no inflammatory response surrounding the necrotic areas. By comparing these signs and symptoms to a healthy liver that displays no signs of reactions, this indicates a presence of the herpesvirus infection. External factors surrounding the birds can also promote the spread of these signs and symptoms and infections. Specifically, environmental changes, such as importing birds from a warm to cold environment as well as creating a stressful event for birds in crowded situations, often triggers a virus amplification and increased virulence. Cause A virus, Psittacid alphaherpesvirus 1, is the etiologic agent that causes Pacheco‚Äôs disease. This virus species is closely related to Gallid alphaherpesvirus 1. It was initially identified as a herpesvirus by examining its virion size, sensitivity to ether, the formation of intranuclear inclusions, its ability to thicken the nuclear membranes of the host cells. Pacheco‚Äôs disease is caused by at least three different serotypes of the herpesvirus. The most common strain that causes Pacheco's disease is Serotype 1. This is followed by Serotype 2 and less frequently, Serotype 3. In curing Pacheco‚Äôs disease, the vaccine developed must protect the birds against these main three serotypes. Transmission Although there is no exact route of transmission, Pacheco‚Äôs disease is not transmissible by humans. It is also not transmissible to other common laboratory animals, including guinea pigs, mice as well as other certain bird species, such as pigeons and canaries. Adult birds that are infected with the herpesvirus causing Pacheco‚Äôs disease can transmit and infect their parent-fed offspring, who may not develop signs. Pacheco‚Äôs disease is usually spread by aerolisation or contact. The main sources of contraction is through the faeces, oral and pharyngeal secretions of carrier birds where the virus has shed, or through contaminated food or water. Once a bird has been infected and recovers from Pacheco‚Äôs disease, it is permanently immune and becomes a carrier of the disease, whether it displays symptoms or not. It is still able to release the virulent virus and so, bring risks into aviaries by infecting other healthy birds. These latently infected birds then become a potential source for future outbreaks as well as a spread of mucosal papillomas. This makes it essential for all recently imported psittacine birds to be tested for the presence of the herpesvirus before entering a resident of aviaries. Droppings of resident birds are also screened periodically to determine the presence of the virus. Infected birds are quarantined and isolated from the rest of the birds to prevent any further transmissions or deaths.  Diagnosis  Pacheco‚Äôs disease can be diagnosed both antemortem and post-mortem. By diagnosing an infected bird antemortem, a DNA probe runs serologically and detects the virus within the bird‚Äôs internal system, mainly to find asymptomatic carriers. This theoretically tests for all known herpesvirus serotypes that infect the birds and involves taking samples from the bird‚Äôs oral cavity or cloaca, where the virus can be consistently detected in most parrots. However, readings can often present a misleading indication that there is no presence of Pacheco‚Äôs disease as a result of samples being collected at the time the bird is not shedding the herpesvirus. The detection of the virus through the DNA probe also helps identify a contaminated environment the bird has recently been exposed to. An indirect immunoperoxidase method is another chemically sensitive and specific testing that laboratories have used to arrive at a reliable result in making a histopathological diagnosis of Pacheco‚Äôs disease. This test does not require highly complex devices or sources. It detects the presence of the avian alpha- herpesvirus, which is the causative agent, through an antiserum obtained in SPF chickens as well as another serum obtained from rabbit anti-chicken IgG that is conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. By applying this test on post- mortem tissues, dark dispersed spotting on the liver and small intestines in necrotic areas display an indication of a reaction to the viral antigen. This is possible due to the high degree of contrast between the viral antigen and host cell that allows a detection of Pacheco‚Äôs disease. This approach has successfully confirmed diagnoses in psittacine birds that were previously diagnosed with Pacheco‚Äôs disease based on its clinical features and macroscopic lesions, indicating its accuracy and reliability. Serologic testing is another diagnosis method that detects the virus within the birds through antibody tests and overseeing the bird‚Äôs antibody tiers. This test involves observing the titre levels in paired serum samples. Increasing titres indicate a recent infection while decreasing titres indicate that the antibodies in the immune system is no longer being stimulated. However, these antibody tests are not as helpful in diagnosing birds that are already sick or those birds that do not live long enough to compare titres. A bird infected with Pacheco‚Äôs disease‚Äôs virus antibody titre is considered latently infected.  Treatment  The molecular structure of Acyclovir, an antiviral medication that acts as an inhibitor to reduce the replication rate of the virus within affected birds. There is no effective vaccine that completely cures Pacheco‚Äôs disease in infected birds. It is difficult to establish an effective treatment for Pacheco‚Äôs disease as birds can suddenly die without displaying any symptoms. However, there have been successful uses of acyclovir, an antiviral medication, in reducing high death rates by rapidly inhibiting the virus replication within the birds. Acyclovir is a synthetic acyclic purine nucleoside that has strong activity against certain members of the herpesvirus group. It is given to birds in the form of oral administration for numerous days or in an IV form. Acyclovir has decreased morbidity and mortality during multiple Pacheco‚Äôs disease outbreaks. However, it cannot prevent the establishment of the carrier and latent infections. This means that acyclovir cannot be used to cure the virus infection and infected birds will remain infected and become a carrier throughout its lifetime. An autogenous, formalin-inactivated vaccine, with an adjuvant of aluminium, hydroxide gel, has similarly been used in an outbreak, in 1999, to successfully protect psittacine birds from Pacheco‚Äôs disease. This vaccine was used to stop the rapid spread of the virus and helped maintain morbidity and mortality rates in psittacine birds within the zoo. By injecting this in the birds, it effectively contained the outbreak, where no herpesvirus was isolated from faecal samples of the many psittacine birds after the outbreak occurred.  Epidemiology  The first case that recognised Pacheco‚Äôs disease occurred in 1930 in Brazil, from birds that were imported from South America. It was not until 1933, when the causative agent was identified. Since then, the global spread of Pacheco‚Äôs disease has increased as a result of domestically raised birds or the transportation of aviaries that contains symptomatic and asymptomatic infected birds.  Outbreaks  In February 1933, an outbreak occurred in Campania, Italy. A shipment of 93 psittacine birds was imported to Campania, Italy, from Guayana, South America. It contained macaws, Amazon parrots, conures and parakeets, who were all transferred to quarantine premises and were housed in cages, based on its size and genera. All birds arrived in good and healthy conditions and were previously vaccinated against PPD and Poxviridae with a commercial vaccine containing PsiHV1. However, 3 of the Conure parakeets suddenly died without displaying any relevant symptoms, followed by the rest of its species. While certain species experienced high mortality rates, others had not, such as the A. Manilata, B. Cbyoptems and A. Mehnocepbala. In this instance, the vaccine failed to serve its purpose as the vaccine only protected the birds against 1 serotype, rather than all 3 known serotypes that cause Pacheco‚Äôs disease. This raised concerns about how vaccines relating to Pacheco‚Äôs disease should be developed in an attempt to protect birds from Pacheco‚Äôs disease. The U.S. has encountered numerous psittacine-disease related incidences linking to Pacheco‚Äôs disease: In December 1977 and January 1978, multiple outbreaks had occurred in a privately-owned bird import quarantine station that was located in Miami, Florida. In the first incident, the Floridan aviary imported 3 macaws from California into an aviary of 18 healthy birds. This consisted of 7 macaws, 8 cockatoos, 2 hornbills and 1 mynah bird. Within a week, the newly imported macaws had died, followed by the other macaws and cockatoos that were originally residing in the Floridan aviary. The other non-psittacine birds, the mynah and hornbills, that were largely exposed to the virus spreading around in the aviary were not affected in this situation and survived the outbreak. In the second incident, 2 macaws and 1 cockatoo that were imported had died. Such high mortality rate in this same Floridan aviary was largely influenced by the overcrowding and stressful environment of the birds. This provided an ideal setting for Pacheco‚Äôs disease to spread and promote the infection by transmitting it from bird to bird. In this instance, examinations of the birds that were presented for necropsy showed that each died suddenly without clear evidence of any sicknesses other than lethargy. There are no linkages between both outbreaks. In March 1991, an outbreak had occurred in an aviary in Wyoming, despite being closed to newly introduced birds for 4 years. Several bird species had died in this outbreak, including 2 golden mantle rosellas, 2 red-fronted parakeets, a yellow-bellied parrot and a double-yellow headed Amazon parrot. These 6 birds showed few to no premonitory signs over the 2 weeks it resided in the aviary before its death. Medical examinations showed an absence of gross lesions while the clinical signs confirmed Pacheco‚Äôs disease as cause of death. This included watery, green diarrhoea as well as depression that terminated in death within a day. In this instance, it is suspected that the source may have come from carrier species that were already residing in the aviary, such as the conures that are considered to be the main carriers of Pacheco‚Äôs disease.

Rudolph I is primarily known for his disputes with Duke Pribislaw I of Mecklenburg. To protect his seat in B√ºtzow, he built a castle close to the border between his prince-bishopric and the Lordship of Parchim- Richenberg, in ecclesiastical respect part of his diocese, but not of his prince-bishopric. Pribislaw I saw this castle as a direct threat and burned it down. He imprisoned Rudolph in his dungeon, but soon released him for a small ransom. Rudolph then tried to overthrow Pribislaw. On his instigation, both an imperial ban and a papal ban were proclaimed against Pribislaw. In 1255, Pribislaw was taken prisoner and handed over to Rudolph. Pribislaw was removed from power and his territory was divided among his brothers and his brother- in-law, the Count of Schwerin. When Rudolph died in 1262, Pribislaw hoped he would be restored to power, but his brothers refused to do this.

It was released as a PlayStation mini on the PlayStation Network in North America on November 8, 2011http://blog.us.playstation.com/2011/11/08/playstation-store-update-212/ and Europe on November 16, 2011.http://uk.playstation.com/psn/games/detail/item307532/Where-is-my-Heart On March 2, 2012, Die Gute Fabrik announced plans to release the game for Windows, macOS, and Linux in the spring of 2012, a date which was pushed back, eventually seeing the Windows and macOS versions released on May 29, 2014, with the Linux version \\"still on the way‚Ä¶\\". Story Where is my Heart? tells the story of a family of three monsters who find themselves lost in the forest after setting out to find their home (a tree) after it mysteriously floats away one day. Elements of familial struggle and working together are sprinkled throughout. Gameplay An example of a level broken up into shuffled frames, which the player must figure out how to navigate. The game starts out as any platformer might, but soon the image breaks into frames of varying sizes, often shuffling them. The player must then try to navigate their way through the level, by piecing together where their character appears to be in any given frame, as well as collecting hearts or figuring out other puzzles that might feature in a level. The player is able to switch between one of the three monster characters at will, each of them having a special ability that can aid in solving a level. Development The idea for the game was derived from Die Gute Fabrik designer Bernhard Schulenburg's memories of being lost in the woods as a child while on a hike with his parents. The game is also an homage to platformers of the 1980s and '90s, and its story and art direction are inspired by \\"German fairytales, the mythical creatures of Central Europe, and Japanese pictogram aesthetics.\\"http://gutefabrik.com/wimh.html Reception Reviews of Where is my Heart? have been generally favorable, with a Metacritic score of 81 out of 100. GameZone reviewer David Sanchez gave applause to the gameplay and art direction, proclaiming Where is my Heart? \\"...a wonderful experience that's both a work of art and proper homage to classic game design...one of the most genius gameplay formats seen in a platformer in a long time.\\" Brendon Keogh of Edge praised the ingenuity in the separated frames mechanic, stating, \\"A less skilled developer could easily abuse such a novel device, but the restrained, careful design of Where is my Heart? ensures the game lasts just long enough to get the most out of its mechanic without succumbing to padding.\\" Christian Donlan of Eurogamer also commended the design as \\"...a concept so ingenious, I'm stunned I've never seen it before.\\" Conversely, David Wolinsky of The A.V. Club found the game interesting but somewhat repetitive, saying, \\"A bit one-note. It's an incredibly interesting note, but still, there isn't much variation as you work your way through all 26 levels.\\" The major complaint of IGN's Ryan Clements was simply that the game's play- through time is too short, recommending the game with a caveat: \\"Play it for something a little different, even if the experience doesn't last longer than a few hours.\\"  References  External links  *Official site *Where is my Heart? developer page 2011 video games Indie video games Linux games MacOS games Network Network Network PlayStation Network games Video games developed in Denmark Windows games ","title":"Where Is My Heart?"},{"id":"36078677","text":"Euriphene intermixta is a butterfly in the family Nymphalidae.

It is an interdisciplinary marine research group and it is funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG). Part of the cluster is the Integrated School of Ocean Sciences (ISOS) which is a post graduate school for ocean sciences in Kiel.  Goals  The ocean plays an important role in the global climate, holds dangers, but simultaneously provides opportunities not just in the form of exploitable resources but also in many different fields of research. With that in mind the scientists in the cluster \\"The Future Ocean\\" have one common goal: to reassess the opportunities and risks of global change for the ocean and to allow a sustainable management of its resources based on these insights.  First Funding Period  Organigram first funding period The Future Ocean The first funding period started on 1 November 2006 and lasted till 31 October 2012. During this first period of funding the cluster of excellence focused on two major areas of research, Greenhouse Oceans (A) and Resources and Risks (B). Each of them was further divided into seven, respectively, six research teams which in turn were based on different research platforms (P1-P4). The research teams encompassed the Integrated School of Ocean Sciences, the cluster's public outreach program and the transfer of research to application.  Greenhouse Oceans  The research area Greenhouse Oceans (A) focused on the causes and effects of climate change in regards to the modern ocean. Interactions between the atmosphere, ocean surface, deep water regions and its organisms were closely studied. It was divided into seven research teams. Their members mostly focused on environmental research ranging from topics such as ocean acidification and its impact on marine life to global warming and its influence on the ocean floor to ocean circulation regarding climate modelling and even ocean surface chemistry, studying the exchange of gases between the water column and the atmosphere.  Resources and Risks  The research area Resources and Risks (B) focused in turn on different resources, their mining and recovery potential but also their sustainable utilization and possible occurring risks. It was divided into six research teams, that focused mostly but not exclusively on economic research ranging from topics such as fishery and the common pool problem to molecular interdependencies within marine organisms for medical research to resource deposits and their safe exploitation and even to submarine hazard research regarding earthquakes and tsunamis.  Second Funding Period  Organigram second funding period The Future Ocean On 15 June 2012 the funding for the cluster of excellence The Future Ocean was extended by another five years. During this period from 1 November 2012 to 31 October 2017 the former research areas Greenhouse Ocean (A) and Resources and Risks (B) were terminated and replaced by the fully integrated Research Topics (R). There are a total of eleven multidisciplinary R topics. The research platforms and part of the central services were merged into the new science support (S). The different research topics (R) do not stray very far from the former research areas Greenhouse Ocean (A) and Resources and Risks (B). The team's scientists from the fields of biology, chemistry, computer sciences, economy, ethics, geography, geosciences, law, mathematics, medicine, philosophy, physics and politics pile their combined knowledge into the research for a common, sustainable ocean for the people.  Governance  The cluster developed an operational framework, which has been approved by the General Member Assembly in 2008. The cluster framework defines the decision making process, advisory mechanisms and several core groups. The General Member Assembly elects the Cluster's director, acting director and members of the Executive Committee. It also votes on new full and associate membership applications. The General Member Assembly meets at least once a year. The Cluster Council is the assembly of principal investigators and junior research group leaders. It consists currently of 55 members and advises the Executive Committee on research-related matters, overall budget allocations and meets at least twice a year. The Executive Committee is composed of a number of representatives from various cluster research and science support topics, participating institutions including platforms, the graduate school, junior research groups, the postdoc network, and PhD students. The Executive Committee meets monthly and makes all operational, management and funding decisions of the cluster. The External Scientific Advisory Board (SAB) is currently composed of 15 national and international experts. The SAB meets in Kiel once a year and provides guidance and advice to the cluster. The cluster has several international partners, e.g. the Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada, Columbia University in New York, USA, the Ocean University of China in Quingdao and others.

During its early career, Rover served in the Far East. During World War II, the submarine operated in the Mediterranean Sea, attacking several Italian convoys and providing assistance to the crippled HMS York during the evacuation of Crete in 1941, before returning to the Far East to operate against the Japanese. The vessel survived the war and was sold for scrap in 1946. Design and construction Ordered by the Royal Navy on 28 February 1929, the submarine was laid down on 24 July 1929 by Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering, at Barrow-in-Furness. A Rainbow-class vessel, the submarine's sisters were HMS Rainbow, Regent and Regulus, and it was long, with a beam of , and a draught of . Carrying a crew of 53 officers and ratings, the submarine displaced surfaced and submerged, and was armed with eight 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes (six in the bow and two in stern) with 14 spare torpedoes for reloads, and one 4.7 in QF Mark IX deck gun. Propulsion was provided by two Admiralty diesel engines, producing 4,640 hp, which were used when the vessel was surfaced, and two electric motors, producing 1,635 hp to power the vessel's two shafts when submerged. The vessel was capable of sailing at when surfaced and when submerged. It was launched on 11 June 1930 and construction was completed on 29 January 1931. Operational service After being commissioned into the Navy on 29 January 1931, Rover was assigned to the 4th Submarine Flotilla, and deployed to China Station. At the outbreak of World War II, Rover was still part of the 4th Submarine Flotilla, serving east of Suez. The submarine was based at Hong Kong until transferring to Singapore in early 1940. While there, it undertook anti-submarine training with Royal Australian Navy vessels deploying to the Mediterranean. Rover was then stationed in the Mediterranean, moving to Aden in August 1940, and arriving in Alexandria in October. The following month, the submarine began patrol operations and in early 1941 Rover attacked several Italian convoys. In April 1941, amidst the Battle of Crete, Rover arrived at Souda Bay from Alexandria to assist in an attempt to salvage the disabled the heavy cruiser HMS York, which had been severely damaged by Italian MT boats. Rover was used to provide electrical power to operate anti-aircraft guns during the operation, but on 24 April 1941, the submarine was bombed and had to be towed to Alexandria to receive temporary repairs before being towed to Singapore for more permanent repairs in late 1941. In early 1942, as the Japanese advanced down the Malay Peninsula towards Singapore, Rover was moved to Bombay, in India, where repairs were completed. At the conclusion of repairs, Rover operated out of Trincomalee, in Ceylon (present day Sri Lanka), escorting several convoys and sinking a total of ten Japanese ships. In 1945, Rover took part in anti-submarine training, before being sold to Joubert of Durban. Rover was the only submarine in her class to survive the war and had a total of six commanders during the war. She was scrapped on 30 July 1946.

It is a multicampi institution, specialising with professional and technological education in different areas of knowledge (biologics/human sciences/exact sciences). It was known previously as Centro Federal de Educa√ß√£o Tecnol√≥gica de Qu√≠mica de Nil√≥polis. IFRJ is a federal institution, public, directly vinculated to the Ministry of Education of Brazil. History=Escola Superior de Qu√≠mica (1947-2008) The story began in 1945 with the creation of the Vocational Industrial Chemistry Technician (CTQI). Since February 1942 the Decree Law 4,127 / 1942 provided in Article 4, the creation of a Chemical Technical School. However, only on 16 August 1943 by Decree-Law was formally established the course by the National School of Chemistry at the University of Brazil, current Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. This course worked on the premises of that University from 1944 to 1946, but soon after, even without the administrative link was changed, the course started to work in space provided by the School National Technical (ETN), current Federal Center of Technological Education Celso Suckow da Fonseca (CEFET-RJ) in Rio de Janeiro. Only on February 16, 1956, promulgated the Law 3,552 / 1956, Second Organic Law of Industrial Education, was created the Federal Technical School of Chemistry of Rio de Janeiro (ETFQ-RJ), a government agency with the mission to offer the Technical Course Industrial Chemistry. Facade For four decades the institution remained working on the premises of TNCs with Course Industrial Chemistry Technician. The facilities were expanded classrooms and more laboratories in 1977. In 1981, after expansion of its facilities, the ETFQ-RJ, following the process of industrial and technological development of the nation, began the upgrade and expansion of its courses, creating Course Food Technician. The year 1986 marked the achievement of a headquarters in the Maracan√£ neighborhood, municipality of Rio de Janeiro and in 1988 the creation of the Technical Course in Biotechnology. In 1994, ETFQ RJ-founded the Decentralized Teaching Unit Nil√≥polis (UNED). Initially, they were only offered technical courses, with new facilities, which relied on laboratories for teaching and research, environment rooms, classrooms, library, cafeteria, auditorium, and sports courts. In 1999 ETFQ-RJ had its headquarters moved to Nilopolis and assumed new responsibilities, to be transformed into the Federal Center of Technological Education Chemistry - Chemistry CEFET / RJ. The transformation in higher education institution allowed to offer undergraduate and graduate together created with the Scientific and Cultural Centre, a space for training and teacher training, dissemination and popularization of science and its interactions with the various human activities. In 2005, the Chemical CEFET / RJ expanded offering sensu post-graduation courses. IFRJ (2008-) The Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of Rio de Janeiro - IFRJ - was established pursuant to Law 11,892, of December 29, 2008, then part of the Federal Professional Education Network, Science and Technology as federal Institute of Education, science and technology (IFET). By law, the transformation of the Federal Center of Technological Education of Nil√≥polis Chemistry (CEFE Nil√≥polis-RJ Chemical), followed by integration of the Agricultural College Nile, until then linked to the UFF were attached to IFRJ campuses.

History Unit Rig was founded in 1935 by Hugh S. Chancey and two partners, Jerry R. Underwood and William C. Guier, who formed a partnership to build a rotary drill rig for oil field work that was more mobile than existing designs. The group based the company in Tulsa, Oklahoma. By 1947, the partnership between the men was beginning to break down when Underwood died, leaving Chancey and Guier as the remaining partners. Guier eventually took control of Unit Rig and in 1951 sold it to Kenneth W. Davis, who already had several oil-field related businesses under the parent company name of Kendavis Industries International. During the 1950s, Unit Rig began to diversify its products away from the limited oil-field products and looked towards mining products to utilize their manufacturing facilities. R. G. LeTourneau had already adapted compact electric drive wheels to construction machinery with great success, prompting Unit Rig to investigate the possibility of building a truck and finding a suitable client to take the finished machine. By 1960, the M-64 prototype truck was completed using General Electric drive systems and featuring special Goodyear low-pressure tires for the suspension. This truck was not a success; however, Unit Rig went on to be a very successful maker of off-highway dump trucks sold under the brand name of Lectra Haul (due to their electric drive system). Lectra Haul was eventually sold to Terex then to Bucyrus Erie, who were taken over by Caterpillar Inc. around June 2011. Some Lectra Haul trucks are still sold alongside Caterpillar's own trucks but are branded as Unit Rig. Unit Rig trucks enjoyed a reputation for a simplified customer friendly design with very little requirement of parts during operation. A large fleet of Unit Rig trucks were sold in countries falling in Arctic circle and they proved to be survivor. Their solid rock like performance forced competitors to spend huge resources on R&D; to match the performance in not only in sub zero but in sub Saharan hot environment. Unit Rig had just 4 engineers to design whole new trucks and a small but very experienced support group. In early 90s, Unit Rig brought in the first truck that had design intent for a min 8000 hours operation per year and successfully proved it. 8000 hours of operation means an availability over 92%. Unit Rig launched industry's first AC drive 150T (MT3300AC) truck with GE Invertex drive followed by 240T AC (MT4400AC) truck. Both trucks wrote new chapters in TCO - Total Cost of Ownership which is an indicator of life time expenses made by a client on parts, fuel and Capex. Unit Rig' truck design philosophy probably prompted later day's Linux like open source programming. In 1998, Unit Rig executed mining industry' the largest single order for supply of 160 trucks to Coal India Limited. Products Jacobs Ranch Mine and operated for 20,000 hours hauling 10 million tons of coal. It is now on display at the outdoor Energy Equipment Exhibit museum in Gillette, Wyoming.

There are a specific number of posts, which can be applied to when they are vacated or established. Professors Finland's system is similar to the traditional German system in that there is a limited number of posts for professors (professori), who head research groups and take part in administration in addition to lecturing. Fulfillment of a professor's post often requires that the previous professor has retired. Traditionally, there was no assistant / associate / full professor career track, nor an official \\"tenure track\\". The title of apulaisprofessori (\\"assistant professor\\") was retired in 1998, but reintroduced in 2010. Qualifications for a professor's position are a doctoral degree and an extensive independent publication and teaching record. The degree of lisensiaatti (licentiate) does not qualify (exceptions are legal, but extremely rare). For example, in medicine, the common degree equivalent to a medical doctor is a lisensiaatti degree: additional research and study is required for the degree called l√§√§ketieteen tohtori, \\"Doctor of Medicine.\\"  Teachers and researchers  Mid-career scholars immediately below the rank of full professor are called \\"yliopistonlehtori\\", a tenured position equivalent to a senior lecturership/readership in the UK or an associate professorship in the US. The honorary title of dosentti is similar in required qualifications, but the related form of employment is often task-based (e.g., teaching a specific course, supervising a specific student) rather than full-time employment. When it does include full-term employment, it has fewer or no administrative responsibilities and may be combined with work at a company or another university. The alternative translation for docent is \\"adjunct professor\\".http://www.eui.eu/ProgrammesAndFellowships/AcademicCareersObservatory/AcademicCareersbyCountry/Finland.aspx The rank of apulaisprofessori (literally \\"assistant professor\\", but may refer to positions at the level of assistant professor or associate professor depending on the university) is also in use for positions that are tenure- track rather than permanent). Junior educators are called by other terms such as assistentti (literally \\"assistant\\" and is typically a position designed for PhD students), lehtori (lecturer), yliopistotutkija (postdoctoral researcher, literally: university researcher), opettava tutkija (teaching researcher), or yliopisto-opettaja (literally \\"university instructor\\").Helsinki University job title glossary The same applies to researchers (tutkija, etc.). Researchers and professors funded by the Academy of Finland are generally styled accordingly, \\"akatemiatutkija\\" and \\"akatemiaprofessori\\" (academy researcher and academy professor, respectively). Academic Positions=Research track * Professori (Professor) is the highest non-administrative position. * Dosentti (Adjunct Professor), is not necessarily permanently associated with the university but holds the right to teach () and supervise doctoral students independently. The title also gives the right to act as a principal investigator. Similarly to German Privatdozent and Swedish docent, receiving the title requires academic merits significantly exceeding a doctoral degree. * Yliopistotutkija (University Researcher), a position, generally temporary, for a senior researcher. * Tutkijatohtori (Post-Doctoral Researcher), a position for a junior post-doctoral researcher. * Tohtorikoulutettava (Doctoral student), Tutkija (Research Associate, Research Scientist) and Projektitutkija (Project Researcher) are positions intended for doctoral students * Tutkimusavustaja or Tutkimusapulainen (Research Assistant) is a Bachelor's or Master's student position. Teaching track * Yliopistonlehtori (\\"UK Senior Lecturer or Reader/US Associate Professor), tenured faculty position involving both research and teaching. * Lehtori (Lecturer) used only at some universities; tends to be replaced with \\"assistant professor\\" tenure-track contracts. * Tutkijaopettaja or opettava tutkija (Senior Instructor), a non-tenured senior position involving both research and teaching. * Yliopisto-opettaja or yliopistonopettaja (University Teacher), a junior teaching-oriented faculty position. Administrative positions * Rehtori (Rector) or kansleri (Chancellor) is the highest official of a university. * Dekaani (Dean) leads a faculty. * Yksik√∂njohtaja (Head of Unit) leads a laboratory or a unit.

It replaces the former church, which was razed by the 1908 Messina earthquake. Located before the Courthouse, the Carmine Church was rebuilt in the eighteenth century Baroque or Rococo style. Designed by the architect Cesare Bazzani (Rome, 1873 - Rome 1939), the church was reconsecrated 15 July 1931. Carmine Church of Messina and Carmelite Convent The Carmelites in Messina The religious Carmelites arrived from the Holy Land in Messina probably not later than 1238 and settled down by the river San Michele, two miles from the city. There, they built their first convent with its church, which they called \\"Santa Maria del Carmelo\\". That place, for the hermit life lived by the brothers, was then commonly called ‚ÄòRitiro‚Äô ('Withdrawal') name that then took all the area. The pressures of the faithful people that flocked, attracted by the admirable life of those monks, induced the Carmelites to relocate and move almost at the mouth of that river San Michele. However, being the second mansion infested with malaria and too exposed to the depredations of pirates and wars, in 1292 the brothers moved to Via degli Argentieri, between the current Via Garibaldi and Via Cavour. But also in this convent, their presence did not last long because it was too close to the Cathedral and those priests considered their masses \\"disturbed\\". The facade of the churchThe brothers then, \\"pro bono Pacis,\\" moved in April 1304 for the fourth time to a new convent, located in Contrada Pozzo Leone (dedicated to Pope Leo II, born in Messina by tradition) where they occupied the church of St. Cataldo located in the area of the current theatre \\"Vittorio Emanuele\\", overlooking Via Cavour. On 5 February 1783, when the church, and all its internal works and tombs, were completely destroyed. The new headquarters, \\"Carmine Maggiore\\" stood on the ancient Via Universit√†, including the current Via San Filippo Bianchi and Via della Zecca. The statue dedicated to Our Lady of Mount Carmel The church of the Carmine, as before, had a unique nave and was lavishly embellished in a Baroque style, with frescoes and oil paintings by Giovanni Tuccari. He had five altars: the main one was dedicated to Our Lady of Mount Carmel, with a painting on wood always considered by Polidoro da Caravaggio, covered with silver-stained leaving visible only the Madonna's face (you can see it in the current Regional Museum), one was dedicated to St Albert of Trapani and was ornamented with four silver \\"plates\\" depicting the life of the saint (stored in current vestry until 1981 when they were stolen). On 28 December 1908 a terrible earthquake struck Messina 1908 Messina earthquake. The Hon. Mirabello, then Minister of the Navy, ruthless anti-clerical, in an interview in early January 1909, accused the clergy of total absenteeism in the earthquake country. To repair this slander, Honorable Joseph Toscano wrote in the newspaper \\"Il Risveglio\\": ¬´Simply for the truth, the undersigned Giuseppe Toscano, former municipal councilor of the hapless Messina testify that immediately following the disaster, I met with three friars of the convent of the Carmine, almost naked, already worked to rescue the buried alive and, although they also just escaped the wreckage and free of any instrument, by sheer force of their arms drew to rescue as many as they could. I gave to them some clothing that I could draw from my house, one room was not completely knocked down, and sat with them at the pitiful work¬ª. Sensing devotion to the Holy Virgin of Carmel, the Archbishop of Messina, D'Arrigo, wanted to entrust the Carmelites one of the first shack-churches built after the disaster, in Via Salandra. At that stood near the church of SS. Lawrence and Anne, the oldest parish in the city, which could include in its records the name of Canon St. Annibale Maria Di Francia, baptized there 7 July 1851. However, the parish priest, old and shabby, needed help. The Archbishop D'Arrigo asked Father Alessi, the prior of the convent, to lend, and the pastor, to concede that his parish would pass to the Carmelites at his death, which occurred in October 1918. In fact in 1926, thanks to the paternal involvement of Archbishop Angelo Paino, the successor of D'Arrigo, the project was obtained for the new church and convent by the renowned architect Cesare Bazzani. The cornerstone that took place on 17 July of that year, after four years, the new convent stood and was opened 3 June 1930. After one year, the new church of the Carmine was completed. On 15 July 1931, the statue of the Virgin of Carmel made its triumphal entry, greeted fondly by Messina people. The Church today Inside of the dome The interior, in the shape of a Greek cross with side chapels, is decorated with polychrome marble and pink marble columns topped with carved capitals. The dome of the church, octagonal, has a circular window on each side and is surmounted by a square lantern. The central compartment has an octagonal shape and is covered by a dome that is in line with Via Nicola Fabrizi and Corso Cavour, to whom all the building, seen from a distance, gives the impression of a terminal point. The church has seven chapels. On the main altar is an eighteenth-century statue depicting the Madonna of Carmel, with the Infant Jesus in her arms, in the act of turning the holy scapular to St. Simon Stock. Church Dome Statues of Our Lady of Mount Carmel and St. Simon Stock * Chapel of St. Heart: it is located in the crossing of the church on the left of the main altar. The niche contains a statue of St. Heart. * Chapel of St. Crucifix: it depicts Mount Calvary, the cross on which Jesus stands against a background of dark clouds that hint of darkness that have arisen time of his death. Sitting at the foot is the Mother of Sorrows with his chest pierced by a sword. * Chapel of Our Lady of Lourdes it is from right beside the main altar. In a cave that seems to remember that French is the wooden statue of Our Lady of Lourdes natural high that comes from the ancient church-cabin (after the earthquake stood at Via La Farina). At his feet there is a small Bernadet. * Chapel of St. Anne: the wooden statue of St. Anne holds an open book with the biblical passage \\"Rorate coeli et desuper nubes pluvant iustum\\" (Drop down dew, ye heavens, from above the clouds rain down the Just). The Santa was, along with St. Lawrence, until 1988, co-owner of the parish that, on that occasion, changed its name to \\"Santa Maria del Carmine.\\" * Chapel of St. Albert of the Abbots: the wooden statue of Albert of Trapani, one of the patrons of Messina, natural height, holding in her arms the Divine Little Child on the right, with the symbolic lily and a book on the left: the symbols of his candor and scrupulous observance of the Rule. It lies on a wooden base, on which is a fluttering ribbon with the inscription \\"Civitas Messana Gaude\\", which invites the city of Messina to enjoy having such a wonderful protector. Behind the saint's feet you can see the stern and the bow of the historic \\"Vascelluzzo\\", a vessel that commemorates the liberation of the city of Messina by a severe famine, and that is carried in procession every year on the day of Corpus Domini. * Chapel of Saint Lucy: it recalls the church \\"Santa Lucia all'Uccellatore\\" which stood near the present sanctuary. Great is the devotion of Messina people for Saint Lucy and they particularly celebrate it in her feast day, 13 December. The Tamburini organ Built by the famous company Tamburini of Crema and tested on January 30, 1954, this organ is the most practical and perfect that could be offered at that time. It has two manuals of 61 keys, a fine console, beyond the radially concave pedalboard with 32 pedals brackets, adjusted every twenty registers, 17 of which are real mechanical. It has a complex of 1,400 rods which, placed on both sides of the loft, forms a complex rich sounds. It has just been subject to a restoration.

Stavrakakis, Lacan and the Political (1999) p. 128 When one is said to have a false pleasure, this is distinct from actually feeling pleasure. Pleasure can be described as being false or true based on the content of where the pleasure comes from. When being faced with a situation where one holds a false belief that in turn makes them feel pleasure, this would be categorized as false pleasure. An example of this could be if someone gets pleasure from being in a happy relationship, yet they are unaware that the other person is cheating. Their pleasure then comes from a false belief. Classical philosophy Plato devoted much attention to the belief that \\"no pleasure save that of the wise is quite true and pure - all others are shadows only\\"Alain de Botton intro., The Essential Plato (1999) p. 364  both in The Republic and in his late dialogue Philebus.Blackburn, p. 130 Augustine saw false pleasure as focused on the body, as well as pervading the dramatic and rhetorical entertainments of his time.B. Krondorfer, Male Confessions (2009) p. 83 and p. 140 When Plato describes false pleasure he defines it in two different ways. The first way is sometimes called the propositional sense of falsity. In this way of looking at falsity of pleasure the truth value of the statement does not affect the fact that the statement is still a statement. The other way Plato uses falsity when looking at pleasure is in the alienans sense. When looking at falsity in this way we are explaining something as being \\"fake\\". In this use of the term falsity the thing we are talking about is in question of existence. Asceticism Buddhaghosa considered that \\"sense-pleasures are impermanent, deceptive, trivial...unstable, unreal, hollow, and uncertain\\"Quoted in E. Conze ed., Buddhist Scriptures (1975) p. 108-9  a view echoed in most of what Max Weber termed \\"world-rejecting asceticism\\".Max Weber, The Sociology of Religion (1971) p. 166 Vain pleasure A specific false pleasure often denounced in Western thought is the pleasure of vanity - Voltaire for example pillorying the character \\"corrupted by vanity...He breathed in nothing but false glory and false pleasures\\".Voltaire, Candide, Zadig, and Selected Stories (1961) p. 121 Similarly John Ruskin contrasted the adult's pursuit of the false pleasure of vanity with the way the child does not seek false pleasures; its pleasures are true, simple, and instinctive\\".John Ruskin, The Stones of Venice Vol 3 p. 189 False pleasure is not to be confused with vain pleasure. The difference is that vain pleasure is when someone feels pleasure from something that others would find morally wrong for them to get pleasure from. Mean while false pleasure is just based on false beliefs regardless of the moral outlook on the source of pleasure. An example of a vain pleasure would be if a person found pleasure in finding out that someone they hate was tortured. This would only count as a false pleasure if the person was not indeed tortured. Sex Sexual intercourse is sometimes seen as a true pleasure (or false one), contrasted with the less real pleasures of the past, as with Donne's \\"countrey pleasures, childishly\\".John Hayward, The Penguin Book of English Verse (1978) p. 77 In the wake of Reich, a distinction was sometimes made between reactive and genuine sexualityOtto Fenichel, The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis (1946) p. 515-6  analysis supposedly allowing people to \\"realize the enormous difference between what they once believed sexual pleasure to be and what they now experience\\".La P. D. A., quoted in Jacques Lacan, √âcrits: A Selection (1997) p. 244 Mass media Popular culture has been a central arena for latter-day disputes over true and false pleasures. Modernism saw attacks on the false pleasures of consumerism from the right,D. Horowitz, Consuming Pleasures (2012) p. 30 as well as from the left, with Herbert Marcuse denouncing the false pleasures of happy consciousness of \\"those whose life is the hell of the affluent society\\".Quoted in John O' Neill, Sociology as a Skin Trade (1972) p. 50 From another angle, Richard Hoggart contrasted the immediate, real pleasures of the working-class from the increasingly ersatz diet fed them by the media.Richard Hoggart, The Uses of Literacy (1968) p. 132 and p. 233 As the 20th Century wore on, however - while concern for the contrast of false and authentic pleasures, fragmented or integrated experiences, certainly remainedHorowitz, p. 2-3  the mass media increasingly became less of a scapegoat for the prevalence of false pleasure, figures like Frederic Jameson for example insisting instead on \\"the false problem of value\\" in a world where \\"reification or materialization is a key structural feature of both modernism and mass culture\\".M.

Life He studied at both Oxford and Cambridge, graduating B.A. at Magdalene College, Cambridge in 1623/4. For a time he appears to have been employed by Robert Bertie, 1st Earl of Lindsey, probably as chaplain. By 1629 he was chaplain to Baptist Hicks, 1st Viscount Campden. Gaule's one preferment was as vicar of Great Staughton, Huntingdonshire, through Viscountess Campden by 1632, though there is some confusion on the point. He claimed in a petition to Parliament that he had been imprisoned by the Parliamentary army, and had been in danger of being shot by order of Edward Whalley. Select Cases of Conscience touching Witches and Witchcraft Gaule clashed with, and preached against, the self-appointed witch-hunter active in East Anglia, Matthew Hopkins. This took place around 1646, when Hopkins and John Stearne were operating in Huntingdonshire. As a result, and to expose the methods used by Hopkins, he wrote Select Cases of Conscience touching Witches and Witchcraft, London, 1646. The work was dedicated to the Huntingdonshire Member of Parliament, Valentine Wauton. Gaule himself followed the position of William Perkins on witchcraft. He objected to the \\"swimming test\\" for witches, used by Hopkins and Stearne in the first half of 1645. Unusually for the time, Gaule engaged with the question of the imp or familiar spirit thought to accompany a witch. While he was convinced enough that witchcraft existed, he suspected theories about it that connected with popular superstition rather than scriptural sources. He distinguished between the workings of a magician and the spells of a witch, leaving some room for the former to operate in good conscience. Gaule took a legalistic and evidentiary approach to witchcraft. He argued for stringent standards of evidence, but also that circumstantial evidence should be admitted because of the difficulty of conviction. His works were consulted at the time of the Salem witch trials for criteria to apply to cases. Cotton Mather in his Wonders of the Invisible World gave an account of Gaule's witch-theories and their discriminations; George Lincoln Burr regarded the account as distorted, however. Other works Other writings by Gaule were: * The Practiqve Theorists Panegyrick. ‚Ä¶ A Sermon preached at Pauls- Crosse, London, 1628. * Distractions, or the Holy Madnesse. Feruently (not Furiously) inraged against Euill Men, or against their Euills, London, 1629. * Practiqve Theories, or Votiue Speculations, vpon Iesvs Christs Prediction, Incarnation, Passion, Resurrection, London, 1629. Frontispiece was by Christof le Blon. * Practiqve Theories, or Votiue Speculations vpon Abrahams Entertainment of the three Angels, &c.;, 3 parts, London, 1630. * A Defiance to Death. Being the Funebrious Commemoration of ‚Ä¶ Viscount Camden, London, 1630. * A Sermon of the Saints judging the World. Preached at the Assizes holden in Huntingdon, London, 1649. * Œ†·ø¶œÇ-ŒºŒ±ŒΩœÑŒØŒ±. The Mag-Astro-Mancer, or the Magicall-Astrologicall-Diviner posed and puzzled, London, 1652. Another edition under the title of A Collection out of the best approved Authors, containing Histories of Visions, &c.;, was published without Gaule's name in 1657. This general attack on magic was dedicated to Oliver Cromwell. In it Gaule lamented that people generally were more ready to consult an almanac than the Bible.Keith Thomas, Religion and the Decline of Magic (1973), p. 353. With Henry Jeanes, Nathaniel Stephens and Anthony Burgess, he took part in the presbyterian attack on Jeremy Taylor's doctrine of original sin. His views appeared in a rare work, Sapientia Justificata (1657). He also criticised Erasmus on the same topic, from the Calvinist angle. At the time of the Restoration, Gaule wrote a tract, An Admonition moving to Moderation, holding forth certain brief heads of wholesom advice to the late and yet immoderate Party, London, 1660, to which he prefixed a dedication to Charles II.

Career Plaque dedicated by Roderick Barclay to commemorate the cricket game held by English soldiers on the eve of the Battle of Waterloo (1815) on the \\"Bois de la Cambre\\" lawn. Roderick Edward Barclay was educated at Harrow School and Trinity College, Cambridge. He entered the Diplomatic Service in 1932 and served at British embassies at Brussels, Paris, Washington, D.C., and at the Foreign Office as head of the Personnel Department. He was then appointed Principal Private Secretary to the Foreign Secretary, Ernest Bevin, 1949‚Äì51. > Barclay was a surprising choice as Bevin's Private Secretary since, at first > sight, he and his intended master had nothing in common. ... But in the > event he was probably the most successful of the exceptionally able men who > served Bevin as Private Secretary. > -- Obituary, The Independent, 1 November 1996 After Bevin moved on due to illness in March 1951 (he died shortly afterwards), Barclay served as Assistant Under-Secretary of State at the Foreign Office 1951‚Äì53, then Deputy Under-Secretary 1953‚Äì56. He was Ambassador to Denmark 1956‚Äì60, then returned to the Foreign Office with the rank of Deputy Under-Secretary, as Adviser on European Trade and relations with the newly created European Free Trade Association 1960‚Äì63.Sir R. Barclay's New Post, The Times, London, 25 February 1960, page 11 He took part in Edward Heath's attempt to join the then European Economic Community which, however, was vetoed in 1963 by French President Charles de Gaulle. Barclay's final diplomatic post was as Ambassador to Belgium, 1963‚Äì69. In 1965, to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the Waterloo battle he set up a commemorative \\"Duchess of Richmond's Ball\\" and planted a tree in the Bois de la Cambre on the lawn where English soldiers had played cricket on the eve of the Battle. Sir Roderick (as he had become) retired from the Diplomatic Service in 1969 and became a director of a unit of the family bank, Barclays Bank SA in France, 1969‚Äì79 (Chairman 1970‚Äì74), also of Barclays Bank International 1971‚Äì77, and of Banque de Bruxelles 1971‚Äì77. He was also a non-executive director of Slough Estates 1969‚Äì84. Private life Roderick Barclay was born in 1909 in Kobe, Japan, the son of Joseph Gurney Barclay an Evangelican Anglican-Quaker missionary by his first wife Gillian Mary Birkbeck, who died from complications in childbirth bearing him. His father later remarried Gwendoline Watney, the daughter of a doctor and one of the first women sociology graduates. His half-brother was the Evangelical Anglican missionary Oliver Barclay (d. 2013). In 1941 he married Jean Cecil Gladstone, only daughter of Sir Hugh Steuart Gladstone of Capenoch, and his wife Cecil Emily Talbot, (d. 1949), a great-granddaughter of Charles Chetwynd-Talbot, 2nd Earl Talbot (father of the 18th Earl of Shrewsbury).This made Lady Barclay a distant cousin of the earls of Shrewsbury & Waterford, via her mother (a great-granddaughter of the 2nd Earl, via his fifth but fourth surviving son, Rev. Gustavus Chetwynd-Talbot, a clergyman). Her great-uncle was Gustavus Arthur Talbot MP. Through her grandmother Susan Frances Elwes, she was also a second cousin of her husband, whose maternal grandmother was Ysabel Caroline Elwes. Jean Barclay was a kinswoman of the great Victorian statesman William Ewart Gladstone.. Her father was the great-grandson and heir male of Robert Gladstone (1773-1835) a younger brother of Sir John Gladstone, 1st Bt (1764-1851), whose fourth son was the Prime Minister. Traced via www.thepeerage.com 5 July 2014. This makes Sir Hugh's grandfather Thomas Steuart Gladstone the first cousin of the Prime Minister; Sir Hugh's father Samuel Steuart Gladstone of Capenoch the second cousin of W.E.'s sons, including his two youngest sons Baron Gladstone of Hawarden and Viscount Gladstone. Sir Hugh himself was the third cousin of W.E.'s grandson Sir Albert Charles Gladstone of Fasque and Balfour, 5th Bt (1886-1967), while Lady Barclay was the fourth cousin of W.E.'s great-grandson Sir Erskine William Gladstone, 5th Bt (b. 1925), the present baronet. Since W.E. Gladstone wasn't granted any peerage, and his two youngest sons's peerages died out with him, the heir male of one of the UK's great Prime Ministers is a mere baronet. Sir Roderick and Lady Barclay had one son and three daughters. Their youngest daughter Davina Cecil Palmer n√©e Barclay is mother of Juliet Palmer, now wife since 1991 of Hugh Cairns, Viscount Garmoyle (b. 1965, eldest son and heir of the 6th Earl Cairns). Her son is in direct succession to the earldom after his father. Publications *Ernest Bevin and the Foreign Office 1932‚Äì69, self- published, 1975. Honours Roderick Barclay was appointed CMG in the King's Birthday Honours of 1948, CVO in the Coronation Honours in 1953 and knighted KCMG in the Queen's Birthday Honours of 1955.

Holdsworth, (25 February 1899 ‚Äì 20 June 1976) was an English scholar, academic, educationalist, cricketer and a distinguished Himalayan mountaineer. He was a member of the first expedition to Kamet in 1931, which included other stalwarts such as Eric Shipton and Frank Smythe. Holdsworth, along with Shipton and Smythe, are credited with the discovery of the Valley of Flowers, now a UNESCO World Heritage Site, during their return from Kamet. Early life The Oxford University Cricket Team, 1922; Holdsworth sits on the chair at the left corner. Holdsworth was educated at Repton School, where he was a pupil of Victor Gollancz, later a famous publisher. He attended Repton under the headmastership of William Temple, the future Archbishop of Canterbury. He later attended the University of Oxford, where he read Literae Humaniores or Classics at Magdalen College. At Oxford he earned a Triple Blue for cricket, football and boxing. He was a first-class batsman and played cricket for Sussex, Warwickshire and Marylebone Cricket Club. Holdsworth briefly served in the First World War as a lieutenant in the Rifle Brigade in 1918 (he served until 1919), after leaving Repton. Career Holdsworth held various distinguished positions in his lifetime. In 1922, he joined Harrow School as a schoolmaster. He was made the master-in-charge of cricket and played for Sussex County Cricket Club. In order to encourage ski mountaineering at Harrow, he established a club called the Marmots. After leaving Harrow in 1933, he took over as principal of Islamia College in Peshawar, Pakistan (at the time in British India), in which position he served for seven years until 1940, when he joined The Doon School in Dehradun. At Doon, he met his old colleague J. A. K. Martyn, whom he had known since his days at Harrow. Martyn was the second headmaster of Doon School. He later retired in Somerset, England. Climbing highlights *1924 ‚Äì Holdsworth was invited by George Mallory to join him on the 1924 British Mount Everest expedition but he was so adamant on taking his skis along that the invitation was withdrawn. Holdsworth later remarked that his \\"intransigence saved my life\\" because it was on this expedition that Mallory disappeared along with Irvine. * 1931 ‚Äì Holdsworth was a member of the first expedition to climb Kamet (7,756 m) in 1931, at the time the highest peak yet climbed.Narinder Kumar and Kapil Malhotra, Kamet East, Kamet West: The Kumaoni Expedition, New Delhi: Vision, 1987, , p. 12. During the Kamet expedition Holdsworth, Shipton and Smythe discovered what they called the Valley of Flowers in the Himalaya, now in the state of Uttarakhand, India. Holdsworth also holds the record of smoking a pipe at the summit of Mt. Kamet. Cricket career Holdsworth was active in first-class cricket from 1919 to 1942. He played for Warwickshire and Sussex. He appeared in 109 first- class matches as a righthanded batsman who scored 4,716 runs with a highest score of 202 among eight centuries.Romilly Holdsworth at CricketArchive See also *Role of The Doon School in Indian mountaineering References ;Notes ;Bibliography * F.

Industrial background  After working some time as an accountant, he joined his father-in-law's contracting business, Isola & Lerchbaumer (later Ilbau) in 1972. Through a series of takeovers, he expanded the company, now known as Strabag, into an international concern, which he controls through the holding company FIMAG (Finanz Industrie Management AG), of which he is the majority shareholder.http://www.raiffeisen.at/eBusiness/services/resources/media/1021234568466-1021919879012_219874997483535595-219847462716636167-1-11-NA.pdf * At the beginning of the 70's, he became chairman of Ilbau AG * In 1998, he became chairman of Bau Holding. * In 2006 he became chairman of Strabag SE. * Haselsteiner is shareholder and director of the Rail Holding AG, which operates the WESTbahn train, a passenger train competing with √ñBB between Vienna and Salzburg.Capital injection dilutes SNCF's stake in Westbahn International Railway Journal 25 April 2013 June 2012, Haselsteiner announced he would resign his executive position in Strabag in June 2014.

It is the successor of the EOS 600D/Kiss X5/Rebel T3i and is the predecessor of the EOS 700D/Kiss X7i/Rebel T5i. Sales began on June 15, 2012. At introduction, recommended retail prices for the body were US$849.99, ¬£699.99 (including VAT), and ‚Ç¨839.99 (including VAT). Features The 650D is the first Canon DSLR that has continuous autofocus in video mode and live view, which Canon calls \\"Hybrid CMOS AF\\". This feature, intended mainly for video recording, is implemented through a new sensor technology in which certain pixels are dedicated to phase-detection AF (traditionally used in DSLRs) and others to contrast-detection AF (used in camcorders). When the subject is in the center of the frame, phase detection is used to identify the subject's current location, with contrast detection then used to fine-tune the focus. Hybrid CMOS AF will be available with all lenses, but other improvements to video autofocus, specifically in smoothness and quietness, will depend on the use of Canon's new STM lenses, two of which were announced alongside the 650D. DPReview noted that the Hybrid CMOS AF system was similar to the focusing system of the Nikon 1 mirrorless cameras. The 650D is also the first DSLR from any manufacturer equipped with a touchscreen, although it is not the first interchangeable-lens camera with this feature. Almost all shooting parameters and camera functions can be controlled either via the touchscreen, or by buttons and the control dial. The AF system used for stills shooting through the optical viewfinder is inherited from the EOS 60D. All 9 points are cross-type, as opposed to only the central point in the 600D. The central point is also dual cross-type (i.e., also sensitive to diagonal lines) at 2.8. The EOS 650D is built with two new shooting modes designed for inexperienced photographers: the Handheld Night Scene mode and the HDR backlight mode. The Handheld Night Scene mode reduces the risk of blur while taking nighttime shots without a tripod while the HDR backlight mode uses Canon's patented multishot system to combine three images into one, balancing both foreground and background exposure. Feature list * 18.0 megapixel APS-C CMOS sensor * DIGIC 5 image processor with 14-bit processing * 95% viewfinder frame coverage with 0.85x magnification * 1080p HD video recording at 24p, 25p (25 Hz) and 30p (29.97 Hz) with drop frame timing * 720p HD video recording at 50p (50 Hz) and 60p (59.94 Hz) * 480p ED video recording at 50p (50 Hz) and 60p (59.94 Hz) * 5.0 frames per second continuous shooting * ISO sensitivity 100 ‚Äì 12800 (expandable to H: 25600) * 3.0\\" Clear View II vari-angle LCD touchscreen with 1.040.000 dots resolution * 9 points AF system, all cross-type at f/5.6. Center point is high precision, double cross-type at f/2.8 * 63-zone color sensitive metering system * Built-in Speedlite transmitter ** The camera is compatible with Canon's latest radio-controlled flashes, but the built-in transmitter is infrared-only. * Built-in stereo microphone * 3.5mm microphone jack for external microphones or recorders One feature of the 600D missing from the 650D is the former's 3-10x digital zoom capability when shooting 1080p video. Ergonomics The articulated screen The 650D has roughly the same dimensions as the 600D, and apart from the touchscreen has largely the same physical controls as previous models. One notable difference is that the two- position power switch of the 600D is replaced with a three-position switch on the 650D, with the added position used to activate the video shooting mode. Speed The DIGIC 5 processor, used for the first time in a consumer-level Canon DSLR, allows for a significant increase in continuous shooting from the 600D of 5.0 frames per second, up from 3.7 frames per second. The 650D is also the first Canon DSLR to support the UHS-I bus . The 650D's autofocus during live view mode is approximately two times faster than the 600D.

The ballad in Nepal Bhasa dates from the late 18th century.Lienhard, Siegfried (1992). Songs of Nepal: An Anthology of Nevar Folksongs and Hymns. New Delhi: Motilal Banarsidas. . Page 84. Page 253. This tragedy song has been cited as the source of \\"Muna Madan\\", a short epic story in the Nepali language composed by Laxmi Prasad Devkota in 1936.Hutt, Michael (1991). Himalayan Voices: An Introduction to Modern Nepali Literature. University of California Press. . Page 41. Page 99. Synopsis The ballad \\"Ji WayƒÅ LƒÅ Lachhi Maduni\\" is in the form of a dialogue. There are three persons, husband, wife and mother-in-law. The man is about to leave Kathmandu for Tibet on work. The song starts with the wife pleading with her mother-in-law to stop him, saying that it's not even been a month since she came to their home and he wants to go away. She offers to hand over her trousseau so that he can start a business in Nepal and not have to go to Tibet. But the husband consoles her that he will be back within a year or two. He starts on the journey after performing an auspicious ceremony, \\"accepting the ritual gifts with his right hand and wiping away the tears with his left hand\\". A few months pass, there has been no word from him, and the wife sees bad omens. One day, a deceitful friend brings a message that her husband has died in Tibet. Distressed, she expresses her wish to join her husband in death, and commits sati despite her mother-in- law's entreaties not to do so. Three years later, the son returns home from Tibet. His mother tells him from the window that he can't come inside the house because they have already performed his death rituals. She also tells him that his wife committed sati after hearing that he was dead. The son is shocked, and goes away and becomes an ascetic.Kasa, Prem Bahadur (ed.) (1983). Bakhan Mye. Kathmandu: Chwasa Pasa. Page 41. Background The title of the song \\"Ji WayƒÅ LƒÅ Lachhi Maduni\\" means \\"It hasn't been a month since I came\\" in Nepal Bhasa. It is a popular seasonal song in Newar society and is sung during the rice planting season.Lienhard, Siegfried (1992). Songs of Nepal: An Anthology of Nevar Folksongs and Hymns. New Delhi: Motilal Banarsidas. . Page 84. The song's theme is based on the life and times of the merchants and artisans of Kathmandu who used to go to Tibet for long periods in the past. Known as Lhasa Newar, they operated business houses in Lhasa and other cities and conducted trade between Nepal, India and Tibet. The artisans built temples and created artworks for the monasteries. The tradition goes back centuries. Page 97. Wives and families were greatly concerned when the travellers left as they often died on the trek across the Himalaya mountains or of the harsh climate on the Tibetan plateau, and ballads describing their hardships are frequently sung.

It was counted as one of Aesop's Fables and is numbered 115 in the Perry Index. Fable and its interpretation There are two Greek sources for this fable, giving conflicting interpretations. One describes how a fowler is so intent on preparing his bird-snares that he treads on a snake and dies from its bite. This story, we are assured, 'shows that when people plot against their neighbours, they fall victim to the same sort of plot themselves'. The sentiment is common in the early fables; the alternative story of the Crow and the Snake comes to the same conclusion. However, the basic situation is transposed by the 2nd century BCE poet, Antipater of Sidon, in a poem collected in the Greek Anthology. Included in the section of sepulchral epigrams, it concerns a countryman keeping the birds from his crops who has stepped on a viper and now sends this warning from the grave: 's broadside satire on human folly showing a fowler, 1588 ::::::::::See how, gazing at what was in the air, ::::::::::I did not see the evil creeping at my feet.Archived online, VII.172 Andrea Alciato coalesces the two in the Latin poem in his Emblemata (1531), which illustrates the theme 'Those who contemplate the heights will fall' (qui alta contemplantur, cadere). The story is told of a fowler out hunting and concludes, ‚ÄòThus the man dies, who looks to the stars with drawn-back bow‚Äô. The preceding emblem had illustrated the fable of the Astrologer who Fell into a Well and this continues the lesson there of the need to keep one's attention focussed on the things of this world. The English emblematist Geoffrey Whitney also uses the story in his Choice of Emblemes (1586) under the device 'Look not on high' (noli altum sapere) but extends the lesson in the second and third stanzas of his accompanying poem. While the third cautions those who practise 'astronomie', ::::::::::Whoe leave the earthe, and studie on the skie, ::::::::::As if they coulde all worldlie thinges expresse, his second warns against pride in learning, ::::::::::Leste when theire mindes do mounte unto the skies, ::::::::::Their fall is wrought, by thinges they doe dispise. The first meaning of the story was not lost sight of, however. The Renaissance poet Hieronymus Osius keeps close to the original telling in his Latin version. A fowler is intent on preparing a snare of reeds and bird-lime, then catches sight of a thrush and inadvertently steps on the snake. He dies in the knowledge that killer hunters will die through the agency of others that hunt to kill.Auceps et Anguis, Fable 56 English tellings, such as those of Roger L'Estrange and Samuel Croxall, speak of the ways of 'Providence'. Illustrations of the fable show a wider variety of bird-catching methods than the text, including setting up nets (as in the edition of Osius), using a bow and arrow (Alciato) or even (as in Croxall) a fowling piece. The species of birds involved are also wide. Antipater mentions starlings and cranes; Alciato thrushes, larks and cranes; L'Estrange has a pigeon and Croxall a ringdove.

Other sports that can be practised at the club are swimming and tennis. History=Beginning The club was founded on May 15, 1955, due to the initiative of a group of men who wanted to encourage their children to practise football by playing matches against other teams from the region. Its first name was \\"Bajo Palermo Baby F√∫tbol Club\\"; Bruno Montesco was the first president of the recently created institution. Bajo Palermo initially focused on children's football, building a specific purpose field but also building a bowls green, an athletics track (nevertheless this sport would disappear in subsequent years), a motocross track (which hosted a wide variety of races that were a great success in the Province) and a basketball stadium. In 1969 the swimming pool was finished, as well as field hockey was introduced at the club, becoming one of the main sports practised at the institution. That same year, the practise of rugby union is incorporated into the club. Coming of rugby The first match played by a rugby team was facing Club Atl√©tico General Paz Juniors (or simply \\"Juniors\\") on May 25, 1959, in order to commemorate the 4th. anniversary of the institution.\\"Palermo Bajo festej√≥ 50 a√±os en el rugby\\" , La Voz, 26 May 2009 Bicycle races, basketball matches and children's games were also part of the celebration. The first rugby line-up was: Casteli, Gamboa, Mateo, Viale, Durante, C. Quiroga, Vicario, Lipari, Mart√≠nez H., Mu√±oz F., Ferrari J., Ferrari H., Hasspacher, Lorenz√≥n, Avila (captain), Gal√≠ndez, Villalba, Mu√±oz M., Valenzuela, De Velva and Pedrerol. Palermo Bajo was defeated by 17-3. In 1994 a youth team (under-21) of the institution toured abroad for the first time in the club's history, tripping to Australia. Two years later Palermo Bajo won the Torneo Preparaci√≥n Oficial of Uni√≥n Cordobesa de Rugby, beating C√≥rdoba Athletic by 25-22. The first team would make its international debut in 2000, touring Europe. Championship Palermo Bajo won its first Torneo de C√≥rdoba title in 2002, defeating Jockey Club C√≥rdoba 23-19 in the final game. Some players of that team were: Agust√≠n Corchio, Paulo Cecchetto, Gast√≥n Toranzo, F. Interdonato, Juan Covassi, Mariano Moya, Mauro Gallardo, Chevi Irazoqui, Esteban Brouwer de Koning, Marcos Ferreyra, Pablo Rusculleda, Ricardo Barbar√°, Rodrigo Altamira, Ezequiel Ferrini, Eugenio Morra, Nicol√°s Cativelli, Daniel Ferreyra and Tom√°s Brouwer de Koning, being coached by Marcelo Ambroggio and Alfredo D√≠az.\\"Bajo Palermo se consagr√≥ campe√≥n en C√≥rdoba\\", Rugbytime, 20 August 2002 The second-division team also won the 2002 and 2003 championships.Historia del Club - official website, by Manolo Calvi√±o Pazos. Colors and badge The first colors of the club (when it was still a children football institution) had been inspired on Buenos Aires' football club V√©lez Sarsfield, the white and blue shirt. Likewise, the rugby jersey design was primarily taken from a picture of a French team of Perpignan. This jersey was worn for 32 years until it was replaced by its current design made by architects Tosi and Cano. About the colors, maroon with thin gold stripes, some version state that they were inspired on oil company Shell's colors. About the badge, the most accepted version about the origins of the emblem refers to a journalist called V√©lez, who usually referred to the players as \\"los Bichos Colorados (the Red Bugs)\\". This nickname was used by artist Ram√≥n Gal√≠ndez to draw the bug (in fact, a beetle) and the rest of club's badge. The beetle has remained as the characteristic symbol of the institution.

Olga has accused her father of kidnapping her daughter. Career Olga was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Saint Petersburg from 2007 to 2011. Family and legal dispute Her father Vladimir is the rector of the Saint Petersburg Mining Institute and owns a 5% share in Phosagro, which owns a phosphate mine in the Arctic. The mine had been at one time partly owned by the currently imprisoned Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Vladimir claims that he did some consulting for the company in 2004 for which he received the shares. The stock is now worth about $260,000,000 after Phosagro was floated on the London Stock Exchange in July 2011. Vladimir Putin went to the Saint Petersburg Mining Institute where he received a degree in 1996, under Vladimir Litvinenko's guidance. Putin has been accused of plagiarising large sections of his dissertation. Clifford Gaddy: \\"Mr. Litvinenko -- who was directly involved in the dissertation, allegedly helped [Putin] choose the topic and was more or less the advisor for the dissertation -- is himself a member of the higher accreditation commission, which is the government- appointed body to be the watchdog over standards about degree-granting, dissertations and quality control for higher education in Russia. So it‚Äôs extra scandalous that he would be involved in this case of, at minimum, shoddiness and plagiarism, possibly something worse, which would be the literal purchase, either by money or political influence, of a dissertation by someone who didn‚Äôt actually do the work. That second point is not clear. I don‚Äôt have proof about that. All I have is proof about the plagiarism.\\" In May 2010 Vladimir and his wife Tatyana were looking after Olga's daughter Ester- Maria Litvinenko (born in 2009), and refused to give her back to Olga. Olga has described this as a kidnapping and has instigated legal proceedings to get her daughter back.

This extensive area of rainforest, which includes the R√≠o Pl√°tano Biosphere Reserve, has long been the subject of multidisciplinary research. Archaeologists refer to it as being a part of the Isthmo-Colombian Area of the Americas, one in which the predominant indigenous languages included those in the Chibchan and Misumalpan families. Due to the many variants of the story in the region, most professional archaeologists doubt it refers to any one actual settlement, much less one representing a city of the Pre-Columbian era. Spanish conquistador Hern√°n Cort√©s reported hearing \\"trustworthy\\" information on a region with \\"towns and villages\\" of extreme wealth in Honduras, but never located them. In 1927, aviator Charles Lindbergh reported seeing a \\"white city\\" while flying over eastern Honduras.Colavito, Jason \\"On the Development of the Ciudad Blanca Myth\\" http://www.jasoncolavito.com/blog/on-the-development-of-the-ciudad-blanca-myth The first known mention by an academic of the ruins under the name Ciudad Blanca (White City) was by Eduard Conzemius, an ethnographer from Luxembourg in 1927. In his report on the Pech people of Honduras to the Society of Americanists, he said the ruins had been found about twenty-five years earlier by someone looking for rubber who got lost in the area between the Paulaya River and the Pl√°tano River. He said it was called the White City because its buildings and a wall around it were white stone.Conzemius, Eduard (1927) \\"Los Indios Payas de Honduras, Estudio geografico, historico, etnografico y linguistico\\" in Journal de la Societ√© des Americanistes. Tome 19, p. 302 In 1939, adventurer Theodore Morde claimed to have found a \\"City of the Monkey God\\" which he and earlier explorers equated with the White City. However, he never provided a precise location for it. Morde died before returning to the region to undertake further exploration. Explorer Tibor Sekelj searched for the White City in 1952 on a small, unsuccessful expedition that was financed by the Ministry of Culture of Honduras. Interest in Ciudad Blanca grew in the 1990s as numerous explorers searched for it and news of archeological work in the area was chronicled in popular media. In 2009, author Christopher Stewart attempted to retrace the steps of Morde with the help of archaeologist Christopher Begley. His book about the search, Jungleland, was published in 2013. In May 2012, press releases issued by a team led by documentary film maker Steve Elkins and by the Honduran government about remote sensing exploration using LiDAR renewed interest in the legend. The lidar mapping revealed not one but two large settlements, one of which was the size of the core of Cop√°n. Some news media asserted that Ciudad Blanca had been found. The association was quickly criticized by University of California, Berkeley archaeologist Rosemary Joyce as \\"hype\\".Joyce, Rosemary \\"Good science, big hype, bad archaeology\\" http://blogs.berkeley.edu/2012/06/07/good-science-big- hype-bad-archaeology/ Discovery of Ciudad Blanca was asserted by the media yet again after a 2015 expedition explored one of the settlements discovered in the 2012 lidar survey, which expedition archaeologists determined was in fact a Pre-Columbian city. This work has also been met with both acclaim and criticism.Joyce, Rosemary There‚Äôs a Real Archaeological Surprise in Honduras‚Ä¶\\" http://blogs.berkeley.edu/2015/03/03/theres-a-real-archaeological-surprise-in- honduras/ Only 200 archeological sites have been discovered and documented in all of Mosquitia during the twentieth century, ranging from large complex settlements to artifact scatters and petroglyphs. The ancient inhabitants of Mosquitia are one of the least-known cultures in Central America, with the most extensive building period being 800-1250 AD. However, only a few have been systematically mapped and scientifically investigated so far and large parts of the region remain scientifically undocumented. The legend of Ciudad Blanca, a popular element of folklore in Honduras, has been the subject of multiple films, TV programs, books, articles, and in 2010 the Honduran government inaugurated an eco-tourism route to take advantage of its popularity called Ruta \\"Kao Kamasa\\" (Route plus the Pech name for the White City) between Santa Maria de Real (Escamilpa in the conquest period), Olancho and going through the Pech villages and the town of Dulce Nombre de Culm√≠ either to the southern entrance of the Rio Platano Biosphere or to the Sierra de Agalta National Park or the proposed Malacate Mountain Wildlife Preserve in the municipio or county of Culm√≠, Olancho Department. Background La Ciudad Blanca is said to be located in la Mosquitia, reportedly in or near the R√≠o Pl√°tano Biosphere Reserve, a protected World Heritage Site located in Gracias a Dios, Colon and Olancho Departments of Honduras in what archaeologists refer to as the Isthmo-Colombian Area. La Mosquitia is a 32,000 square mile stretch of dense forest, swamps, lagoons, and coastline encompassing eastern Honduras and northern Nicaragua. The ecology of this region is primarily a rainforest habitat, although parts are savannah and swamp. Mosquitia is occupied by several different indigenous peoples including the Pech, Miskito, Miskito Sambu, and Tawakha, as well as mestizo populations and those of European and East or South Asian ancestry. These groups all speak their own languages, but Colonial-era reports also mention \\"Mexicano\\" (presumably Nahuatl) and variants of Lencan languages (Colo, Ul√∫a, Lenca) in the Taguzgalpa area east of Trujillo.Herranz, Atanasio (2000) Estado, sociedad y lenguaje La politica linguistica en Honduras, Tegucigalpa: Editorial Guaymuras The Pech (at one time referred to as Paya) \\"trace their ancestry to Chilmeca in the Pl√°tano River headwaters, near the legendary and lost 'Ciudad Blanca'.\\"Stevens, Stanley (1997) Conservation Through Cultural Survival: Indigenous Peoples and Protected Areas. Island Press, Washington, DC. p. 106. In the past another group of Indians known to the Miskitos as the Rah, who were very warlike and ate people, also lived in the area.Wood, Scott (2103) La Moskitia desde adentro. Tegucigalpa: Secretaria de Cultura, Artes y Deportes. The Rio Platano Biosphere declared in the 1980s is a larger area that includes all the protected area decreed in 1961 by the Honduran Congress at the suggestion of the Maker of Honduras's 1954 General Map Dr. Jes√∫s Aguilar Paz as the Ciudad Blanca Protected Area. The Honduran-Nicaraguan border dispute wasn't decided until 1960 in the World Court at The Hague. Aguilar Paz had included on his map a place called \\"Ciudad Blanca\\" with a question mark.(Aquilar Paz, Jesus (1954) Mapa General de la Republica de Honduras) The Pech Indian name for the ruin is Kao Kamasa (White House in English, Casa Blanca in Spanish).Flores, Lazaro H. and Wendy Griffin (1991) Dioses, Heroes, y Hombres en el Universo Mitico Pech, San Salvador: Universidad Centroamericana Jos√© Simeon Ca√±as Popular accounts of the Ciudad Blanca claim it was a city of great wealth, associated with the town or Province of Taguzgalpa east of Trujillo, that the Spanish on repeated occasions tried to conquer but could not.Conzemius, Eduard (1927) \\"Los Indios Payas de Honduras, Estudio geografico, historico, etnografico y linguistico\\" in Journal de la Societ√© des Americanistes, Tome 19, 1927, p. 245-302 Indigenous people such as the Pech, Tawahkas, and Miskitos talk about a city that cannot be entered, or if regular people enter they can not take anything out of it, and if they tell where it is, they will be punished. In some versions, it is the hiding place of deities who retreated from the Spanish invaders. Some accounts of Ciudad Blanca include allusions to the legend of El Dorado, an imaginary location in South America.Wood, Scott(2013) La Moskitia Desde Adentro: Aspectos Hist√≥ricos, antropologicos, y culturales, Tegucigalpa: Secretaria de Cultura, Artes y DeportesConzemius, Eduard (1927) Los Indios Payas de Honduras, Estudio geografico, historico, etnografico y linguistico, in Journal de la Societe des Americanistes, Tome 19, 1927, p.302Griffin, Wendy (2013) \\"Jungleland\\" In Honduras, the Colonial era Spanish had a gold mine located between the Paulaya and Sico Rivers, an area named El Dorado in Colonial times.Conzemius, Eduard (1927) \\"Los Indios Payas de Honduras, Estudio geografico, historico, etnografico y linguistico\\" in Journal de la Societ√© des Americanistes, Tome 19, 1927, p.245-302 History The precise origin of the Ciudad Blanca legend is unclear. Spanish Conquistador Hern√°n Cort√©s is often cited as the earliest reference to the story, but he actually never mentioned a \\"white city\\" and his geographical references are vague. Begley suggests that elements of the legend probably originated with preexisting Pech and Tawahka stories and that those were conflated with Spanish fables from the time of the Spanish Conquest. Spanish conquest Around 1520, Cort√©s received what he considered to be \\"trustworthy reports of very extensive and rich provinces, and of powerful chiefs ruling over them\\". For example, Cort√©s made inquiries about a place called Hueitlapatl√°n (literally Old Land of Red Earth in Nahua), also known as Xucutaco (written Axucutaco in one copy of Cort√©s' letters) for six years. In 1526, he wrote to Spanish Emperor Charles V detailing what he had learned. \\"So wonderful are the reports about this particular province,\\" he wrote, \\"that even allowing largely for exaggeration, it will exceed Mexico in riches, and equal it in the size of its towns and villages, the density of its population, and the culture of its inhabitants.\\" According to Cort√©s, this place was located \\"between fifty and sixty leagues\\" (around 130‚Äì155 miles/210‚Äì250 km) from Trujillo. Although it is often assumed that Cort√©s and other conquistadors searched for it, there is no record of such attempts and it was never located. The Spanish of Trujillo strongly affected the Indians of the Ciudad Blanca area through epidemics against which they had no defenses such as bubonic plague (peste) and smallpox (viruelas),MacLeod, Murdo (1973) Spanish Central America: A Socio-Economic History 1520-1720, Berkeley: University of California through capturing 150,000 Indians which they sent from Trujillo to be slaves in the Caribbean Islands of Santo Domingo and Cuba where by 1545 all but 11 had died and later sent the last of their 300 encomienda Indians to guard the Fort Santo Tomas Guatemala in 1645,Newson, Linda (1986) The Cost of Conquest: Indian Decline under Spanish Rule in Honduras.

Tegucigalpa: Secretar√≠a de Cultura, Artes y Deportes  Nineteenth-century speculation  The publication by Lord Kingsborough of his nine-volume Antiquities of Mexico beginning in 1830 aroused significant interest in cultures of the Pre-Columbian era in Mexico and Central America, contributing to a legacy of romantic speculation about \\"lost cities\\" in Latin America that persists to this day.Williams, Stephen (1991) Fantastic Archaeology: The Wild Side of North American Prehistory. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylviania Press.Wauchope, Robert (1962) Lost Tribes and Sunken Continents: Myth and Method in the Study of American Indians. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. In 1839, just a year after Honduras became an independent and sovereign state, attorney, explorer, and travel writer John Lloyd Stephens visited the remains of Cop√°n, a Maya site in Honduras, as well as dozens of ruins in Central America and Mexico. When he described his discoveries in the best-selling, two-volume Incidents of Travel in Central America, Chiapas, and Yucat√°n, with illustrations by his partner Frederick Catherwood, the public's imagination was ignited. However, early scholars tended to ignore the cultures of the challenging Mosquitia region and little exploration was undertaken. Even so, rumors of lost cities persisted. In the United States, speculation about Lost Tribes and other connections between the Bible and the Americas, especially as recounted in the Book of Mormon, and the popularity of the Lost World genre of fantasy literature ignited the public imagination. Many people presumed under the Manifest Destiny that the ruins of Mexico and Central America would eventually become the property of the United States. The Miskito King and General Thomas Lawrie signed a peace, friendship and mutual assistance treaty with Honduras in 1845, ending more than three centuries of war between the Kingdom of the Miskito Indians, which included the Ciudad Blanca area, and the Hondurans.Duran, Romulo E. (1936) \\"Efemerides de Honduras\\" Revista del Archivo y Biblioteca Nacional, T. XV, No. 1, pp. 15-19.Wood Ronas, Scott (2013) La Moskitia Desde Adentro: Aspectos Historicos, Antropologicos y Culturales, Tegucigalpa: Secretar√≠a de Cultura, Artes y Deportes The following year the sister of the Miskito King, Ana Frederica as regent, signed a peace treaty with the Nicaraguan government. In 1860 the Honduran government and Great Britain signed a treaty turning the Honduran Mosquitia over to the Honduran government \\"wherever the border might be with Nicaragua\\"Griffin, Wendy y CEGAH(2005) Los Garifunas de Honduras, San Pedro Sula: Central Impresora and Great Britain also signed a similar treaty with the Nicaraguans. However, Honduran control remained minimal in the area, and the actual decision that the Ciudad Blanca area actually even belonged to the Honduran government was not made until 1960, after a brief border war in 1958-1959 known as \\"Guerra de Mocoron\\".  Early-twentieth-century exploration and speculation  During World War I, archaeologist Sylvanus Morley collected intelligence for the Office of Naval Intelligence, while also undertaking an archaeological survey of the coastal rivers of Mosquitia.Harris, Charles H. (2009) The Archaeologist Was a Spy: Sylvanus G. Morley and the Office of Naval Intelligence Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press In 1924, archaeologist Herbert Spinden made an expedition to visit sites on the R√≠o Patuca and the R√≠o Pl√°tano in eastern Honduras, reporting on his experiences first in an article in The New York Times and in a paper presented that same year at the 21st International Congress of Americanists in Gothenburg, Sweden.Spinden, Herbert J. (1925) \\"The Chorotegan Culture Area,\\" 21st International Congress of Americanists, Gotheburg, Sweden 2: 529-545 In his paper, Spinden identified a \\"Chorotegan\\" culture whose material remains were found in a region that extended from central Honduras to eastern and northwestern Costa Rica. He reported, photographed, and described large, elaborately stone metates and cylindrical vessels that had been found as surface finds in Mosquitia and which he collected for the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology at Harvard University. Spinden drew comparisons between this material and objects collected by Minor Cooper Keith in Costa Rica in the late 1800s as well as those reported in 1901 and 1907 publications by Carl Vilhelm Hartman from Mercedes and other sites in Costa Rica. While some believe earliest mention of the \\"White City\\" appears to have been made by pilot Charles Lindbergh, who is said to have reported ruins he saw while flying over Honduras in 1927. However, author Jason Colavito notes, \\"So far as I know, Lindbergh‚Äôs 1927 claim is where many believe the name Ciudad Blanca comes from, but even this isn‚Äôt certain since this legend saw print only in the 1950s, some three decades after the fact.\\"Colavito, Jason (2013) On the Development of the Ciudad Blanca Myth, JasonColavito.com. Lindbergh is said to have described it as \\"an amazing ancient metropolis.\\"Stewart, Christopher S. (2013) Goodbye, iPhone. Farewell, Brooklyn. Let‚Äôs move to Honduras and camp with jaguars. Salon.com, 5 January 2013. However, according to Colavito, \\"The oft-quoted phrase 'an amazing ancient metropolis,' attributed in the recent book Jungleland to Lindbergh, is actually another author‚Äôs paraphrase of a third author‚Äôs 1958 claim.\\" The first mention by an academic of the ruins under the name Ciudad Blanca (White City) was by an ethnographer from Luxemburg Eduard Conzemius in 1927 in his report on the Paya Indians of Honduras to the Society of Americanistes where he said the important ruins had been found about 25 years earlier between the Paulaya River and the Plantain River by someone looking for rubber and lost in the area. It was called the White City because its buildings and a wall around it were of white stone. In 1933, archaeologist William Duncan Strong explored Honduras for the Smithsonian Institution, concentrating on the Bay Islands and northeastern part of the mainland. In his 1935 report on the expedition, Strong reports that \\"the famed 'White City' of the Paya\\" is said to reside in the upper Pl√°tano region, according to \\"local tradition\\". According to Strong, Spinden, who visited the area in 1924, \\"does not describe any ruins but mentions the occurrence of stone bowls with animal and bird heads, and great metates and slabs similar to those at Las Mercedes in Costa Rica.\\" Also in 1933, Honduran president Tiburcio Car√≠as sponsored an expedition to the region. The government was planning to open Mosquitia to colonization and wanted to perform an ethnological study of the indigenous peoples before their way of life was disturbed. They contracted with Museum of the American Indian founder George Gustav Heye to perform the study. Explorer R. Stuart Murray was hired to lead the expedition. He brought back a few artifacts, and a rumor of \\"a great ruin, overrun by dense jungle.\\" \\"There's supposedly a lost city... which the Indians call the City of the Monkey God\\", he reported. \\"They are afraid to go near it for they believe that any one who approaches it will, within the month, be killed by the bite of a poisonous snake.\\" A return trip to complete the study and search for the city was held in 1934, but did not find it. In 1941, archaeologist Doris Zemurray Stone published The Archaeology of The North Coast of Honduras (1941), a major synthesis of the archaeology of Honduran Mosquitia that contained no reference to Ciudad Blanca = Theodore Morde and the \\"Lost City of Ancient America's Monkey God\\" = An illustration by Virgil Finlay for The American Weekly representing the Temple in Morde's \\"Lost City of the Monkey God.\\" In 1940, George Gustav Heye hired American adventurer and future spy Theodore Morde to perform a third expedition. The goal of the expedition was to further study the local indigenous people, explore archaeological sites, chart the upper reaches of the Wamp√∫ River, and search for a rumored \\"lost city.\\" After four months, Morde and his colleague Laurence C. Brown reported having made a great find, which included ancient razor blades. \\"'City of the Monkey God' is believed located: Expedition reports success in Honduras expedition\\" read the headline of the New York Times. According to the letter Morde sent home, the \\"city\\" was located in \\"an almost inaccessible area between the Paulaya and Pl√°tano Rivers.\\" Morde and Brown, following Spinden's earlier terminology, described their find as the capital of an agricultural civilization of the Chorotega people. When he returned to the states, Morde described traveling miles through swamps, up rivers, and over mountains before coming across ruins that he interpreted as the remains of a walled city. In an article for The American Weekly, a Sunday magazine tabloid edited by fantasy fiction author A. Merritt,Maliszewski, James (2011) Merritt and Memory, Grognardia. he claimed to have evidence of large, ruined buildings. He said that his Paya guides told him that there once was a temple with a large staircase leading to a statue of a \\"Monkey God.\\" Morde speculated that the deity was an American parallel to the Hindu deity Hanuman, who he says \\"was the equivalent of America's own Paul Bunyan in his amazing feats of strength and daring.\\" According to Morde, he was told that the temple had a ‚Äúlong, staired approach‚Äù lined with stone effigies of monkeys. ‚ÄúThe heart of the Temple was a high stone dais on which was the statue of the Monkey God himself. Before it was a place of sacrifice.‚Äù The steps to the dais were said to have been flanked by immense balustrades. ‚ÄúAt the beginning of one was the colossal image of a frog; at the beginning of the other a crocodile.‚Äù He also said the guides told him the city had been inhabited by the Chorotegas \\"a thousand or more years ago\\". Morde thought the ruins which he found with white stone walls, large bases, and stairways were built by the Chorotegas (people from Cholula in Mangue, who in Honduras also sometimes appears as Cholulatecas‚Äîpeople from Cholula in Nahuat and those in Honduras seemed to have spoken Nahua).Morde, Theodore (1939) Los Misterios de la Mosquitia Hondure√±a La Ciudad del Mono-Dios . Informe al Ministerio de Cultura, Turismo e Informaci√≥n. TegucigalpaChapman, Anne (1974) Los Nicaroas y los Chorotegas seg√∫n las Fuentes historicas. San Jos√©: Universidad de Costa RicaGriffin, Wendy, Hern√°n Martinez Escober, Juana Carolina Hernandez Torres (2009)Los Pech de Honduras: Una Etnia que Vive, Tegucigalpa: Instituto Hondure√±o de Antropolog√≠a e Historia Morde also related a story about a monkey who had stolen three women with whom it bred, resulting in half-monkey half- human children. He claimed, ‚ÄúThe native name for monkey is Urus, which translates literally into ‚Äòsons of the hairy men.‚Äô Their fathers, or fore- fathers, are the Ulaks, half-man and half-spirit, who lived on the ground, walked upright and had the appearance of great hairy ape-men.‚Äù According to journalist Wendy Griffin, Nahuat speakers repeated a similar story to anthropologist James Taggart many years later. In Morde's version, the hybrid children were hunted for revenge, while in the Nahuat version the child grew up to be Nahuehue, a Thunderbolt god. Morde and Brown brought back thousands of artifacts, most of which became part of the collection of the Heye Foundation Museum of the American Indian in New York City. These included stone blades, a flute, stone statuary, and stone utensils. Morde and Brown also reported having found evidence of gold, silver, platinum, and oil. The artifacts are now part of the National Museum of the American Indian in Washington, D.C. Morde vowed to return to Honduras in January 1941 to undertake further study and excavate the \\"city,\\" but did not. He died in 1954 from an apparent suicide, never having secured funds to return to the area. He had not revealed the precise location of his supposed discovery, causing later conspiracy theorists to assert that his death was the result of sinister forces. Later authors, including journalists Christopher Stewart and Douglas Preston, have associated Morde's \\"City of the Monkey God\\" with Ciudad Blanca.Nawotka, Edward (2013) Book review: 'Jungleland,' by Christopher S. Stewart, GuideLive Books, The Dallas Morning News, 18 January 2013. Preston uncovered Morde's journals and revealed in his book, The Lost City of the Monkey God, that Morde‚Äôs claim of finding the Lost City was entirely fabricated, and that his and Brown‚Äôs search for the legendary city was actually a cover for a secret hunt for placer gold‚Äîwhich Morde and Brown discovered and mined in quantity along a tributary of the Rio Blanco, far from where Morde claimed to have found the ruins. Morde's journals suggest he hastily acquired the artifacts near the coast, after the expedition emerged from the jungle.  Late-twentieth-century exploration and speculation  German geographer Karl Helbig in 1953 did an extensive investigation of archaeological sites in the old Paya region, including Valley of Agalta, and the Rio Platano area identifying sites, and drawing examples of the archaeology with three pages of discussion specifically about \\"die Weisse stadt\\" (Ciudad Blanca or White City in German) .Helbig, Karl (1956) Antiguales (Altert√ºmer) der Paya Region und die Paya Indianer von Nordost-Honduras. Hamburg: Selbstverlag des Hamburgisch en Museum f√ºr Volkerkund und Vorgeschichte In 1960, the Honduran government portioned off a 2,000 square mile piece of Mosquitia and called it the Ciudad Blanca Archaeological Reserve. In 1980, UNESCO named a larger area encompassing the earlier Reserve the R√≠o Pl√°tano Biosphere Reserve. In 1982, it was designated a World Heritage Site. The Biosphere program was renamed as the Man in the Biosphere, to include the understanding that this is not a park without people, but rather the area has thousands of native people, some of whom tell the stories that the big rocks with petroglyphs on the Rio Platano such as Walpa Ulban Silp (Peque√±a Piedra tallada) y walpan Ulban Tara (Grande Piedra tallada) mark the umbilical cord of their people, that that is where they came out of the earth to this earth.Wood Ronas, Scott (2013) La Moskitia Desde Adentro Aspectos Historicos, Antropologicos, y Culturales. Tegucigalpa: Secretar√≠a de Cultura, Artes y Deportes According to Dr. Chris Begley, there have been people in what is now the Rio Pl√°tano Biosphere and the Ciudad Blanca area for at least 3,000 years A 1976 expedition by David Zink and archaeologist Edwin M. Shook was filmed by a television crew. The crew traveled by airplane and helicopter to Mosquitia, where they located ancient mounds over which a local had built his dwelling. They also unearthed several stone monoliths. Since the 1980s, archeologists including Begley, George Hasemann and Gloria Lara Pinto have explored the area and have documented hundreds of sites, including Crucitas del R√≠o Aner, the largest recorded until the 2012 lidar expedition documented two larger sites, one of which still remains unexplored. News of their finds, combined with the ease of spreading information on the Internet, has led to unprecedented interest since the turn of the century. The British sent two expeditions Operation Drake and Operation Raleigh to look for the lost White City in the Pl√°tano River and Rio Tinto and down the Paulaya River areas the early 1980s. They found both archaeological sites that were fairly simple such as would be expected of hunting and fishing people in the rainforest like the Pech and the Tawahkas, but they also reported large complex sites which are usually identified with stratified societies like Mesoamerican societies, instead of the more equalitarian leadership styles of the Pech and Tawahkas.Clark, Catherine et al.

Cambridge University PressGriffin, Wendy, Hernan Martinez Escobar, Juana Carolina Hernandez Torres (2009) Los Pech de Honduras: Una Etnia que vive. Tegucigalpa: Instituto Hondure√±o de Antropolog√≠a e Historia In the 1990s, explorer Ted Maschal (a.k.a. Ted Danger) undertook various expeditions in search of Ciudad Blanca that were sponsored by an organization he founded called the Society for the Exploration and Preservation of Honduras (SEPH). His principal interest was in tracing evidence for a historical basis of the myth of Quetzalcoatl and for a Nahuatl presence in the region. It was his conclusion that architectural remains in the region had been built by people of the Pipil culture who spoke Nahua. Academics who have supported the probable builders of the large ruins of the Ciudad Blanca area within and next to the Rio Pl√°tano Biosphere include Dr. William Fowler, the leading ethnohistorian of Nahua speaking Pipiles and Nicaraos in the Central American area, and Wendy Griffin, the ethnohistorian working with Ted Maschal and author of several books on the Indians of NE Honduras, particularly the Pech Indians.Pe√±a, Gustavo (2012)\\"Ciudad Blanca, una leyenda que ha sobrevivido al paso de los siglos\\" in http://www.elheraldo.hn/csp/mediapool/sites/ElHeraldo/AlFrente/story.csp?cid=565265&sid;=300&fid;=209 Consulted January 14, 2015 Dr. Chris Begley did not agree with this identification and felt that the Indians native to the Mosquitia adopted traits like ball courts, stone-sided temple mounds with stairs reaching 12 meters high, walled cities, white stone paved roads down to the rivers and between parts of the sites, the extensive use of stone corn grinding stones, terraced agriculture, the use of fine orange pottery, the adoption of incised punctates and dots designs (such as were found on Fine Orange and coarser ceramics in Cholula in the Classic Period),Coe, Michael (1984) Mexico, London:Thames and Hudson and the use of caves for ceremonial purposes such as are found at the archaeological site of Las Crucitas on the Aner river near the Guampu River from contact with Mesoamerican neighbors and traders. According to the Honduran government SEDINAFROH website about Nahuas, they mention that caves used for ceremonial uses were an important identifying part of that cultureNahoas, www.sedinafroh.gob.hn Consulted 14 January 2014 and El Heraldo reporters noted that the use of caves, the stone grinding stones, and the stone statues in the Rio Platano/Ciudad blanca area were similar to what was found in Southern Honduras in Choluteca (name from Cholulateca, people from Cholula in Nahua).Pe√±a, Gustavo (2012) \\"Fragmentos milenarios que unen el este y el sur de Honduras\\" in http://www.elheraldo.hn/alfrente/565231-213/fragmentos-milenarios-que-unen-el- este-y-el-sur-de-honduras Consulted January 14, 2015 Francis Yakam-Simen, Edmond Nezry, and James Ewing used the remote sensing method of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images to \\"identify and locate the lost city\\" in thick vegetation. They also used \\"radargrammetric techniques\\" to produce a digital elevation model (DEM) of the study area and to combine various data sources \\"to allow visual interpretation of the remnants of Ciudad Blanca by visual photo interpretation\\". This work sought to \\"guide a group expedition in the future\\",Francis Yakam-Simen; Edmond Nezry; and James H. Ewing \\"Legendary lost city Ciudad Blanca found under tropical forest in Honduras, using ERS-2 and JERS-1 SAR imagery\\", SPIE Proceedings 3496, Earth Surface Remote Sensing II, 21 (October 9, 1998). The archaeology shown includes Quetzalcoatl heads, corn grinding stones (manos and metates), and petroglyphs of a king with a crown and a monkey head.  Early-twenty-first-century exploration and speculation  A documentary featuring Begley and actor Ewan McGregor aired on American television in 2001. = Jungleland expedition = In 2009, journalist Christopher S. Stewart, accompanied by archaeologist Christopher Begley undertook an expedition as the basis for a book, published as Jungleland (2012), in which he sought to retrace the explorations by Morde. Using Morde's journals as a guide, Stewart and Begley visited a number of archaeological sites in the region. However, they could not be sure they followed Morde's path exactly, and thus were unsure if what they found was what Morde claimed to have seen.Jungleland: A Mysterious Lost City, a WWII Spy, and a True Story of Deadly Adventure, by Christopher S. Stewart, Kirkus Review. = Under the LiDAR (UTL) project = During the 1990s, documentary film maker Steve Elkins became fascinated by the legend and made multiple trips into the Honduran rain forests in search of a \\"lost city\\", but did not find it. In 2009, he learned that a team led by archaeologists Arlen and Diane Chase of the University of Central Florida used LiDAR to map a area covering most of the Vaca Plateau in Belize that includes the ruins of Caracol, a Maya site located in a dense rainforest. LiDAR mapping revealed that approximately 90% of the site's remains had not been identified by conventional ground survey and revealed large structures, roads, reservoirs, and even looted tombs. The mapping was funded by NASA and the data was collected by the National Science Foundation (NSF) National Center for Airborne Laser Mapping (NCALM), a research center for airborne scientific LiDAR mapping. Elkins teamed with film maker Bill Benenson to found UTL (\\"Under the LiDAR\\") Productions LLC to fund the mapping, later ground searches, and film production focused on discovering settlements in the region where Ciudad Blanca is supposedly located in eastern Honduras. Over seven days in 2012, they flew a Cessna 337 Skymaster carrying LiDAR equipment over four target areas. The LiDAR data, merged with GPS data, was originally interpreted by Carter, who said: \\"I don't think it took me more than five minutes to see something that looked like a pyramid.\\" He believed that the images showed some pillars, many geometric mounds, linked plazas, and extensive areas of human-altered terrain. When he learned of the find, √Åfrico Madrid, the Minister of Interior, informed Honduran President Porfirio Lobo Sosa that he believed Ciudad Blanca had been located. According to Preston, both of them \\"credited the hand of God\\", with Madrid remarking: \\"There are no coincidences...I think that God has extraordinary plans for our country, and Ciudad Blanca could be one of them.\\" On May 15, 2012, Elkins and Juan Carlos Fernandez D√≠az, the Honduran LiDAR operator, presented their results live on Honduran television. They qualified their announcement by describing their find as \\"what appears to be evidence of archaeological ruins in an area long rumored to contain the lost of Ciudad Blanca\\", but reports in mainstream media announced the city had been found. As with the previous finds, some archaeologists immediately criticized the announcement. Rosemary Joyce, a Mesoamerican specialist and expert on Honduran archaeology from UC Berkeley, called it \\"big hype\\" and \\"bad archaeology\\". She said: \\"This is at least the fifth time someone's announced that they've found the White City... there is no White City. The White City is a myth. I'm quite biased against this group of people because they are adventurers and not archeologists. They're after spectacle.\\" However, she confirmed that the images did show what appeared to be archaeological features and remarked there were what seemed to be: \\"...three major clusters of larger structures, a plaza, a public space par excellence, and a possible ball court, and many house mounds.\\" Preston noted: \\"She guessed that the site dated from the late- or post-classic period, between 500 and 1000 AD.\\" In May 2013, Elkins' archaeological team announced additional details based on further analysis of the LiDAR data, and news media once again promoted the legend of a \\"lost city\\". In February 2015, a joint Honduran-American expedition organized by UTL and the Honduran government explored one of two larges sites revealed in the 2012 lidar survey. Ten PhD scientists took part, including Honduran and American archaeologists, anthropologists, engineers, along with filmmakers, a writer, support personnel and Honduran Special Forces soldiers. The team surveyed and mapped extensive plazas, earthworks, an earthen pyramid, irrigation canals and a possible reservoir. They also discovered an untouched cache of elaborately carved stone offerings at the base of the central pyramid, placed there when the city was abandoned 500 years ago. In August 2016, the UTL team published an account of their findings in a peer-reviewed, online journal. A popular account of the expedition appears in a 2017 book by Douglas Preston. Archaeological interpretations Archaeological interpretations of Ciudad Blanca are practically nonexistent. Ciudad Blanca is not mentioned in academic syntheses of Honduran archaeology or Begley's 1999 dissertation on the archaeology of the region.Lange, Frederick W. and Doris Z. Stone, eds. (1984) The Archaeology of Lower Central America. University of New Mexico Press, Albuquerque. Stories about spotting la Ciudad Blanca from a distance are common in Honduras today. Archaeologist Gordon Willey suggested that people were misinterpreting white limestone cliffs as architecture. However, the Pech, the Miskitos, and Ladinos in the Mosquitia also report seeing the Ciudad Blanca and even spending the night there when out hunting and Ladinos in particular have guided film makers and archaeologists to archaeological sites in the region.Wood Ronas, Scott (2013) La Moskitia: Aspectos Hist√≥ricos, Antrop√≥logicos, y Culturales, Tegucigalpa: Secretar√≠a de Cultura, Artes y Deportes In 1994, George Hasemann, former head of the Archaeology Section of the Instituto Hondure√±o de Antropolog√≠a e Historia (IHAH), said the 200 or so known archeological sites in Mosquitia may have been part of a single political system dominated by a \\"huge primate center,\\" meaning a single settlement many orders of magnitude larger than others, that has not yet been identified. Hasemann, referring to archaeological remains of settlements as well as the tales told about them, told a journalist that there might be multiple \\"ciudades blancas\\" in Mosquitia. There have been multiple claims of the discovery of Ciudad Blanca. \\"Every ten years or so, somebody finds it,\\" says Begley, who documented this history of claims in a 2016 article for the book Lost City, Found Pyramid. Most professional archaeologists remain skeptical that the various legends surrounding Ciudad Blanca refer to a specific site. According to Begley, the various version of the legend do not provide \\"any characteristics, traits, or identifying attributes\\" making it impossible to say that any given archaeological site is THE Ciudad Blanca. Jason Colavito, an author and blogger about pseudoarchaeology, identifies promotion of the \\"White City\\" myth as part of a neoliberal strategy to bring tourism to Honduras. UTL interpretations of LiDAR data In mid-June 2012, archaeologist Christopher Fisher of Colorado State University, a Mesoamerican specialist with expertise in Western Mexico,Hopkins, Curt \\"Indiana Jones goes geek: Laser-mapping LiDAR revolutionizes archaeology.\\" Arstecnica March 10, 2012. joined the UTL project. Fisher, who had previously used LiDAR at the Pur√©pecha archaeological site of Angamuco in Michoac√°n, Mexico, spent six months analyzing Elkins's data. In December, he presented his findings to the team. \\"There is a big city [at T3],\\" he said. \\"It's comparable in geographic area to the core of Cop√°n\\" (about two square miles). He also identified a large city at T1, numerous small sites, and possible a small city at T2. According to Fisher, the sites at T1 and T3 are as large or larger than the biggest previous finds in Mosquitia. \\"Each of these areas was once a completely modified human environment,\\" he said. Fisher said each of the sites had clear division of space, social stratification, and had roads leading to farms and outskirt settlements but, unlike Cop√°n and Caracol, which were built around a central core, the Mosquitia settlements were more dispersed. Fisher and geographer Stephen Leisz, both of Colorado State University, presented their findings at the annual conference of the American Geophysical Union in May 2013. When asked if Ciudad Blanca had been found, Fisher laughed and said \\"I don't think there is a single Ciudad Blanca. I think there are many.\\" The legend may hold cultural meaning, he said, but for archeologists it is mostly a distraction. Additional research in the area has been reported by Douglas Preston in a March 2, 2015 article for National Geographic. Preston notes that, \\"Archaeologists surveyed and mapped extensive plazas, earthworks, mounds, and an earthen pyramid...\\" and \\"also discovered a remarkable cache of stone sculptures\\" including metates or stone seats and \\"finely carved vessels decorated with snakes, zoomorphic figures, and vultures\\". The project conducted excavations in 2016 and 2017, uncovering hundreds of stone offerings left at the base of the central earthen pyramid, the first such intact cache that had ever been excavated in Honduras. The work was conducted by a joint Honduran American archaeological team under the direction of Virgilio Paredes, Director of the Instituto Hondure√±o de Antropolog√≠a e Historia. However, the archaeological discoveries generated criticism from several Honduran archaeologists, who asserted that Ciudad Blanca was and remains a myth and not a \\"discovery\\".\\"Honduran Archaeologists Criticize US Claim of Archaeological 'Discovery'\\" http://hondurasculturepolitics.blogspot.com/2015/03/honduran- archaeologists-criticize-us.html Honduran archaeologist Ricardo Agurcia remarked, \\"What I have been able to see has very little scientific merit. What I find strange as well is that news of this type comes out first published outside Honduras\\". A few archaeologists in the U.S. have also been critical of the project, with Rosemary Joyce stating: \\"Reading these reports, it seems like 1915 has come again and everything actual archaeologists have spent the last century learning has been swept away. For modern archaeologists who aren‚Äôt trying to aggrandize themselves or live a fantasy about tomb raiders, the imagery of 'discovery' and 'lost civilizations' make this story tragic: instead of knowledge, this story is a message of ignorance.\\"Joyce, Rosemary \\"There‚Äôs a Real Archaeological Surprise in Honduras‚Ä¶\\" http://blogs.berkeley.edu/2015/03/03/theres-a-real-archaeological-surprise-in- honduras/ In an interview with The Guardian, project archaeologist Chris Fisher claimed, \\"We never said it‚Äôs Ciudad Blanca or the city of the lost monkey god\\" and he dismissed the charges as \\"ridiculous\\" and coming from archaeologists who had not participated in the expedition, had no idea where the site was, and had no knowledge of the archaeological findings as they had not yet been published. The Honduran government also defended the joint Honduran-American research project against its critics. ‚ÄúThey criticized, because they were not involved,\\" said Virgilio Paredes, Director of the Honduran Institute of Anthropology and History. ‚ÄúCome on! They should be saying, ‚ÄòHow can we get involved and help?‚Äô This is a project for my country, Honduras‚Äîfor my children‚Äôs children.‚Äù Increased understanding of the region Archaeologists have come to realize that societies of what is now referred to as the Isthmo-Colombian Area likely cleared huge areas of land and practiced agriculture. Fisher believes the assumed \\"inhospitable jungle\\" was probably more like a \\"tended garden\\" of numerous crops mingled together around dense housing settlements. Fisher's view is consistent with other recent interpretations of indigenous agriculture in southern Central America. Indigenous societies of the region built monumental architecture, plazas, and even parallel-sided ballcourts for playing something similar to the Mesoamerican ballgame. These societies probably built their houses and large superstructures from perishable materials such as wattle and daub and thatching with foundations of rounded river cobbles rather than the cut stone and rubble used in large buildings of the Mayas Similar construction techniques as used in the Ciudad Blanca area were also reported by the Spanish for the Nahua speaking Nicaroa communities in Nicaragua, too.Fowler, William (1989) The Cultural Evolution of Ancient Civilizations: The Pipil-Nicaroa of Central America. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press To date, the most extensive archaeological survey of the Department of Gracias a Dios was conducted by Begley, who documented dozens of sites with significant architectural remains. According to Begley, the region's culture was influenced by both the Maya and Nahuat people but the principal pre-Columbian population appears to have been the ancestors of the Pech, a Chibchan-speaking people. Cultural impact The legend of Ciudad Blanca is widely known in Honduras. In June 2012, Honduran daily newspaper El Heraldo featured a multi- part series on the legend of Ciudad Blanca and archaeological remains in the R√≠o Pl√°tano Biosphere Reserve. To the Pech people of Honduras, \\"the thing that's 'lost' in this lost city isn't the city itself\\", explains Begley. \\"It represents a kind of golden age, their lost autonomy, or hope, or opportunity.\\" In a Pech story called the \\"Patatahua\\", collected by anthropologist Lazaro Flores, the people of Ciudad Blanca were \\"allied with the spirits of the great storms\\" such as the Thundergods.  El Xendra  In 2012, Honduran filmmaker Juan Lu√≠s Franconi directed El Xendra, a feature- length science fiction motion picture filmed in Honduras. In the movie, four scientists experience a series of paranormal events that lead them to a place called Ciudad Blanca. The cast included Juan Pablo Olyslager (Carlos), Boris Barraza (Doc), Roc√≠o Carranza (Marcela), and Fabian Sales (Diego). The marketing of the film referenced the 2012 phenomenon with a plot set in January 2013, after the supposed December 21, 2012 \\"Maya apocalypse.\\" Jungleland In his 2013 nonfiction book Jungleland, journalist Christopher S. Stewart recounts his exploration of the rainforest habitat of Gracias a Dios in search of Ciudad Blanca. Archaeologist Christopher Begley helped lead the trip, which took Stewart to a previously documented archaeological site with monumental architecture. The story climaxes when Stewart and Begley arrive at the large ruins, which may or may not have been what Morde found. It ends on a philosophical note. The site cannot possibly be la Ciudad Blanca, Begley explains, \\"because the White City must always be lost\\" by definition. Legend of the Monkey God On October 4, 2015, the National Geographic Channel premiered Legend of the Monkey God, a documentary about Steve Elkins' quest to find the White City. It features interviews with Elkins and author Douglas Preston, who accompanied the 2015 expedition to Honduras, as well as with Stewart. The Lost City of the Monkey God On January 3, 2017, the book The Lost City of the Monkey God: A True Story by author Douglas Preston, was published. It chronicles the history of the search for Ciudad Blanca or the Lost City of the Monkey God and provides a history of Steve Elkins' search for Ciudad Blanca and a description of the Under the LiDAR (UTL) expedition and its results.

History  Following May 1948 Congress of the Hague, was created in Italy, in December 1948, a National Council of the European Movement which was an organism in charge of the cooperation between the pro-European MPs and the European Federalist Movement. However its rebuilding was necessary in 1956 because of the opposition inside the pro-European movement between the so- called ‚Äúfunctionalists‚Äù, supporters of a progressive market integration of the ‚Äúlittle Europe‚Äù ‚Äì in which they recognized the necessary base for every further development ‚Äì and the majority of the Italian federalists, like Altiero Spinelli, very critical about the European governments after the failure of the European Community of Defence. In these conditions, it seemed unavoidable that the CIME assumes de facto an alternative character respecting to the militant federalism because of its composition (including political parties in charge and unions related to these). This situation evolved with time, notably thank to the accession of Giuseppe Petrilli at the Presidency in autumn 1964. In spite of being a former member of the EEC-three-first-year Commission, he matured a vision of the integration process which surpass the intergovernmental approach. The merger between the CIME and the Federalist Movement came to a conclusion in 1966 with the adhesion of the second to the first. The European Movement joined ‚Äì first at the national level then to the European one ‚Äì the fundamental positions of the federalist strategy and so recognized the importance of European Parliament election at the universal direct suffrage as an indispensable condition for any further progress on the political and institutional camp. When the parliamentary initiative of Altiero Spinelli (after the 1979 first EP elections) demonstrated the adequacy of this strategy, the CIME gave it its full support, through the strong pressure in favour of the treaty project made by the European Parliament to the Italian presidency of the Community, in the first semester of 1985. From there, the successive presidencies of Mauro Ferri, Mario Zagari e Giorgio Napolitano largely confirmed the continuity of the rapport within the CIME between the national political, social-economic forces and the federalist avant-garde. So the CIME counted among the protagonists in Italy of the constant commitment in favour of the Euro creation but also of European institutional reforms to get to the adoption of a real Constitution for the Union.

It lies in the inner part of the Lufilian arc. Today, the south-western extension of the massif lies under the Kafue National Park. Formation Field studies and U-Pb (uranium-lead) dating show that the massif is a large composite batholith that has intruded into the upper Katangan (Kundelungu) strata of sediments in the Lufilian arc during or after tectonic activity. Sample U-Pb dates for syntectonic granite in the massif are 559¬±18 and 566¬±5 Ma, and for post- tectonic granite 533¬±3 Ma. These show that the Kundelungu sediments date to before 570 Ma; the deformation of the inner Lufilian arc and voluminous syntectonic granite plutonism took place around 560‚Äì570 Ma; and the major tectonic activity had ended by around 530‚Äì540 Ma. The Hook massif is bounded to the south by the Mwembeshi dislocation, a Pan-African transcurrent shear zone. Syntectonic rhyolite intruded in this shear zone dates to 551¬±19 Ma, so the transcurrent shearing happened about the same time as the batholith intrusion and was probably due to the same causes.

Life  Gunzelin III was the son of Count Henry I and his wife, Audacia. He inherited the County of Schwerin when his father died in 1228. As his was still a minor at the time, his mother acted as his guardian and regent. She ensured that he would hold the county of Schwerin as a feudal fief. After the Battle of Bornh√∂ved (1227), Duke Otto I of Brunswick and Luneburg was held captive in Schwerin. As a condition for his release, he had to confirm Gunzelin III as the holder of the fiefs Schwerin held from Brunswick. During this period, all feudal transactions of the County were sealed by both Gunzelin and his mother. On 1 November 1246, they jointly founded Zarrentin Abbey and donated some land to it. On 30 October 1230, Gunzelin III was engaged to Princess Margaret of Mecklenburg and Lord John I, who had just come of age, was appointed co-guardian. On 21 November 1267, Gunzelin was elected patron of the Archbishopric of Riga. During his visit to Riga, he probably also visited the monastery at Daugavgrƒ´va, to which he had donated some land in the village of Siggelkow in 1235. Gunzelin III died in 1274. After his death, his sons Helmold III and Niklot I divided their inheritance. Helmod III received Boizenburg, Wittenburg and Crivitz and founded the Schwerin- Wittenburg line. Niklot I received Schwerin, Neustadt and Marnitz and founded the Schwerin-Schwerin.  Marriage and issue  In 1241 in Mecklenburg, Gunzelin III married a member of the House of Nikloting - Margaret, the daughter of Henry Borwin II.

The production of porcelain at the factory began in 1810. Potteries in the West Riding of Yorkshire had been increasing in number throughout the 18th century but English experimentation with porcelain had been concentrated in the south and Midlands until this point, although a number of potteries in the vicinity of the Don Pottery began making porcelain shortly afterwards, including the world-famous Rockingham Pottery. Don pottery porcelain which was produced between 1810 and 1830 was of a very high quality and was exported worldwide. Whilst the pottery was initially very successful, financial problems arose in the 1830s and the Greens were forced to sell the pottery in 1839, when it was purchased by Barker and Sons, who owned the nearby Mexborough Pottery.

Featuring guest vocals from rapper 2 Chainz, \\"Sweat\\" is Ciara's debut release under Epic Records after publicly asking to leave previous label Jive Records. The label failed to support Ciara creatively and financially on previous albums, Fantasy Ride (2009) and Basic Instinct (2010), contributing to poor performance of both albums. Ciara's contract with Epic Records reunited the singer with her mentor L.A. Reid, who is credited as originally signing the singer to his LaFace Records label during the beginning of her career in 2004, as well as having a hand in producing her debut album, Goodies (2004). Initially touted as the lead single from Ciara, \\"Sweat\\" received mixed reviews from music critics, with some describing the song as a heavy club song, while others referred to the song as boring. \\"Sweat\\" was likened to previous urban singles \\"Goodies\\" (2004) and \\"Like a Boy\\" (2006). It was serviced to rhythmic radio stations on June 18, 2012; however, its planned digital release for June 19, 2012 was cancelled. Epic Records subsequently noted the song as a promotional single when it charted at number eighty-six on the US Billboard Hot R&B;/Hip- Hop Songs chart. The song was replaced by a ballad called \\"Sorry\\" as the lead single from Ciara but what when that underperformed too, both songs were scrapped from the album and replaced with an R&B; midtempo song called \\"Body Party\\", subsequently touted as the album's new lead single.  Background and release  Ciara's previous two albums, Fantasy Ride (2009) and Basic Instinct (2010), both underperformed commercially compared to the singer's first two albums; Ciara: The Evolution (2006) debuted at number one, while her debut album, Goodies (2004), debuted at number three. Following a heavy period of legal issues and unauthorized leaking of songs from the Fantasy Ride recording sessions, Ciara recorded Basic Instinct in strict confidentiality. Ciara reflected on the album's progress at the time, stating that she wasn't interested in first week sales or performance. However, Gerrick Kennedy from the Los Angeles Times attributed Basic Instincts lack of success to multiple pushbacks and the leaking of material from the album's recording sessions. Eventually, Ciara broke her silence revealing that Jive Records had not financially supported her with Fantasy Ride and Basic Instinct. Ciara was left to pay for promotion herself, which included funding the music video and radio release of her last single \\"Gimmie Dat\\". She publicly asked to be released from Jive on February 14, 2011. On July 12, 2011, it was reported that she had reunited with L.A. Reid by signing with his record label Epic Records. Reid had previously signed Ciara to LaFace Records at the start of her career and was a factor in the commercial success of her debut album, Goodies (2004). Billboard magazine went on to confirm her move to Epic in September 2011. On May 30, 2012 during promotional appearances for That's My Boy, a film Ciara stars in, the singer announced she had a new single on the way called \\"Sweat\\". Just five days later on June 4, 2012, \\"Sweat\\" premiered online, the bass-heavy record features upcoming rapper 2 Chainz and was unveiled as the lead single from Ciara's fifth album Ciara (2013). The record was serviced to rhythmic radio stations on June 18, 2012 and was scheduled for release as a digital download on June 19, 2012. However, the digital release did not happen as planned, and when charting Billboard listed the song as a promotional single. On August 13, 2012, Ciara revealed through a handwritten letter that a song called \\"Sorry\\" would be released as the album's lead single.  Composition and reception  \\"Sweat\\" is an uptempo \\"bass-heavy\\" club song which features rapper 2 Chainz. Serving as Ciara's debut release with Epic Records, \\"Sweat\\" was described by MTV News as a throwback to \\"Ciara's old roots,\\" particularly drawing comparisons to \\"Like a Boy.\\" It was written by Ciara, 2 Chainz, William Wesson, Patrizio Pigliapoco, Christopher Trujillo, K. Townsend, and S. Randolph. The song was described as \\"bass-heavy banger\\" by Rap-Up. Becky Bain from Idolator, however, was disappointed with \\"Sweat,\\" describing the song as \\"not very exciting.\\" In her review, Bain said, \\"Ciara's vocals go nowhere, the beat doesn't pick up or drop off or twist or turn unexpectedly, and the repetitive lyrics are your generic sexy-dancefloor bon mots.\\" Chart performance \\"Sweat\\" peaked at number 86 on the Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs chart in Billboard magazine. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" - ! scope=\\"col\\" Chart (2012) !!

The pH activated protein possesses two transmembrane segments and a highly selective pore region, responsible for the gating and shuttling of K+ ions out of the cell. The amino acid sequence found in the selectivity filter of KcsA is highly conserved among both prokaryotic and eukaryotic K+ voltage channels; as a result, research on KcsA has provided important structural and mechanistic insight on the molecular basis for K+ ion selection and conduction. As one of the most studied ion channels to this day, KcsA is a template for research on K+ channel function and its elucidated structure underlies computational modeling of channel dynamics for both prokaryotic and eukaryotic species.  History  KcsA was the first potassium ion channel to be characterized using x-ray crystallography by Roderick MacKinnon and his colleagues in 1998. In the years leading up to this, research on the structure of K+ channels was centered on the use of small toxin binding to reveal the location of the pore and selectivity filter among channel residues. MacKinnon‚Äôs group theorized the tetrameric arrangement of the transmembrane segments, and even suggested presence of pore-forming ‚Äúloops‚Äù in the filter region made of short segments of amino acids that interacted with K+ ions passing through the channel The discovery of strong sequence homology between KcsA and other channels in the Kv family, including the Shaker protein, attracted the attention of the scientific community especially as the K+ channel signature sequence began to appear in other prokaryotic genes. The simplicity of the two transmembrane helices in KcsA, as opposed to the six in many eukaryotic ion channels, also provided a method to understand the mechanisms of K+ channels conduction at a more rudimentary level, thereby providing even great impetus for the study of KcsA. The crystal structure of KcsA was solved by the MacKinnon group in 1998 after discovery that removal of the C-terminus cytoplasmic domain of the native protein (residues 126-158) increases the stability of crystallized samples. A model of KcsA at the 3.2A resolution was produced that confirmed the tetrameric arrangement of the protein around a center pore, with one helix of each subunit facing the inside axis and the other facing outwards. Three years later, a higher resolution model was produced by Morais-Cabral and Zhou after monoclonal Fab fragments were attached to KcsA crystals to further stabilize the channel. In the early 2000s, evidence for the occupation of the selectivity filter by two K+ atom during the transport process emerged, based on energy and electrostatic calculations made to model the pore region. Continued investigation of the various opened and closed, inactive and active conformations of KcsA by other imaging methods such as ssNMR and EPR have since provided even more insight into channel structure and the forces gating the switch from channel inactivation to conduction. In 2007, Riek et. Al. showed that the channel opening that results from titrating the ion channel from pH 7 to pH 4, corresponds to conformational changes in two regions: transition to the ion-exchanging state of the selectivity filter, and the opening of the arrangement of TM2 at the C-terminus. This model explains the ability of KcsA to simultaneous select for K+ ions while also gating electrical conductance. In 2011, the crystal structure of full length KcsA was resolved to reveal that hindrance by the previously truncated residues permits only straightforward expansion of the intercellular ion passage region of the protein. This research provides a more detailed look into the motion of separate channel regions during ion conduction. In the present day, KcsA studies are focused on using the prokaryotic channel as a model for the channel dynamics of larger eukaryotic K+ channels, including hERG.  Structure  The crystal structure of KcsA. Only two of the four subunits are shown here. The protein is shown in green, backbone carbonyl groups (oxygen = red, carbon = green) and potassium ions (occupying the S2 and S4 sites) and oxygen atoms of water molecules (S1 and S3) are purple and red spheres respectively.The structure of KcsA is that of an inverted cone, with a central pore running down the center made up of two transmembrane helices (the outer- helix M1 and the inner-helix M2), which span the lipid bilayer. The channel itself is a tetramer composed of four identical, single-domain subunits (each with two Œ±-helices) arranged so that one M2 helix faces the central pore, while the other M1 helix faces the lipid membrane. The inner helices are tilted by about 25¬∞ in relation to the lipid membrane and are slightly kinked, opening up to face the outside of the cell like a flower. These two TM helices are linked by a reentrant loop, dispersed symmetrically around a common axis corresponding to the central pore. The pore region spans approximately 30 amino acid residues and can be divided into three parts: a selectivity filter near the extracellular side, a dilated water-filled cavity at the center, and a closed gate near the cytoplasmic side formed by four packed M2 helices. This architecture is found to be highly conserved in the potassium channel family in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. The overall length of the pore is 45 √Ö, and its diameter varies considerably within the distinct regions of the inner tunnel. Travelling from the intracellular region outwards (bottom to top in the picture) the pore begins with a gate region formed by M2 helices at 18 √Ö in diameter, and then opens into a wide cavity (‚àº10 √Ö across) near the middle of the membrane. In these regions, K+ ions are in contact with surrounding water molecules but when they enter the channel from the selectivity filter at the top, the cavity is so narrow that K+ ions must shed any hydrating waters in order to enter the cell. In regards to the amino acid composition of the pore-lining residues within KcsA, the side chains lining the internal pore and cavity are predominantly hydrophobic, but within the selectivity filter polar amino acids are present that contact the dehydrated K+ ions.  Selectivity filter  The wider end of the cone corresponds to the extracellular mouth of the channel made up of pore helices, plus a selectivity filter that is formed by a TVGYG sequence, (Threonine, Valine, Glycine, Tyrosine, Glycine), characteristic of potassium channels. Within this region, coordination between the TVGYG amino acids and incoming K+ ions allows for conduction of ions through the channel. The selectivity filter of KcsA contains four ion binding sites, although it is proposed that only two of these four positions are occupied at one time. The selectivity filter is about 3 √Ö in diameter. though molecular dynamics simulations suggest the filter is flexible. The presence of TVGYG in the filter region of KcsA is conserved even in more complex eukaryotic channels, thus making KcsA an optimal system for studying K+ channel conductance across species.  Function  KcsA transitions from a closed to open conformation upon protonation of the M2 helix at low pH. Voltage gating results in the collapse of the selectivity filter and subsequent inactivation. Image is adapted from Thompson et al. 2008. The KcsA channel is considered a model channel because the KcsA structure provides a framework for understanding K+ channel conduction, which has three parts: Potassium selectivity, channel gating by pH sensitivity, and voltage-gated channel inactivation. K+ ion permeation occurs at the upper selectivity filter region of the pore, while pH gating rises from the protonation of transmembrane helices at the end of the pore. At low pH, the M2 helix is protonated, shifting the ion channel from closed to open conformation. As ions flow through the channel, voltage gating mechanisms are thought to induce interactions between Glu71 and Asp80 in the selectivity filter, which destabilize the conductive conformation and facilitate entry into a long-lived nonconducting state that resembles the C-type‚Äìinactivation of voltage- dependent channels. In the nonconducting conformation of KcsA at pH 7, K+ is bound tightly to coordinating oxygens of the selectivity filter and the four TM2 helices converge near the cytoplasmic junction to block the passage of any potassium ions. At pH 4 however, KcsA undergoes millisecond-timescale conformational exchanges filter permeating and nonpermeating states and between the open and closed conformations of the M2 helices. While these distinct conformational changes occur in separate regions of the channel, the molecular behavior of each region is linked by both electrostatic interactions and allostery. The dynamics of this exchange stereochemical configurations in the filter provides the physical basis for simultaneous K+ conductance and gating.  K+selectivity  The sequence TVGYG is especially important for maintaining the potassium specificity of KcsA. The glycines in this selectivity filter sequence have dihedral angles that allow carbonyl oxygen atoms in the protein backbone of the filter to point in one direction, toward the ions along the pore. The glycines and threonine coordinate with the K+ ion, while the side-chains of valine and tyrosine are directed into the protein core to impose geometric constraint on the filter. As a result, the KcsA tetramer harbors four equal spaced K+ binding sites, with each side composed of a cage formed by eight oxygen atoms that sit on the vertices of a cube. The oxygen atoms that surround K+ ions in the filter are arranged like the water molecules that encircle hydrated K+ ions in the cavity of the channel; this suggests that oxygen coordination and binding sites in the selectivity filter are paying for the energetic cost of K+ dehydration. Because the Na+ ion is too small for these K+-sized binding sites, dehydration energy is not compensated and thus, the filter selects against other extraneous ions. Additionally, the KcsA channel is blocked by Cs+ ions and gating requires the presence of Mg2+ ions.  pH Sensitivity  The pH- dependent conductance of KcsA indicates that the opening of the ion channel occurs when the protein is exposed to a more acidic environment. NMR studies performed by the Riek group show that pH sensitivity occurs in both the C-terminal TM2 region of the protein as well as with Tyr78 and Gly79 residues in the selectivity filter. There is evidence to suggest that the main pH sensor is in the cytoplasmic domain. Exchanging negatively charged amino acids for neutral ones made the KcsA channel insensitive to pH even though there were no amino-acid changes at the transmembrane region. In addition, between the pH of 6 and 7, histidine is one of the few titratable side chains of histidines; they are absent in the transmembrane and extracellular segments of TM2 but present at KcsA's C-terminus. This highlights a possible mechanism for the slow opening of KcsA which is particularly pH sensitive, especially as the conformational propagation of channel opening signal from the C-terminus to the selectivity filter could be important in coordinating the structural changes needed for conductance along the entire pore. NMR studies also suggest that a complex hydrogen bond network between Tyr78, Gly79, Glu71 and Asp80 exists in the KcsA filter region, and further acts as a pH-sensitive trigger for conductance. The mutation of key residues in the region, including E71A, results in a large energy cost of 4 kcal mol‚àí1, equivalent to the loss of the hydrogen bond between Glu71 and Tyr78 and the water-mediated hydrogen bond between Glu71 and Asp80 in KcsA(E71A). These studies further highlight the role of pH gating in KcsA channel function.  Voltage Gating  In 2006, the Perozo group proposed a mechanistic explanation for the effects of voltage fields on KcsA gating. After adding a depolarizing current to the channel, the reorientation of Glu71 towards the intracellular pore occurs, thereby disrupting the Glu71-Asp80 carboxyl-carboxylate pair that initially stabilizes the selectivity filter. The collapse of the filter region prevents entry into or facilitate exit from the inactivated state. Glu71, a key part of the selectivity filter signature sequence that is conserved among K+ ion channels, plays a pivotal role in gating as its ability to reorient itself in the direction of the transmembrane voltage field is able to provide an explanation for voltage gating events in KcsA. The orientation of amino acids in the filter region might play significant physiological role in modulating potassium fluxes in eukaryotes and prokaryotes under steady-state conditions.  Research = Function  The precise mechanism of potassium channel selectivity continues to be studied and debated and multiple models are used to describe different aspects of the selectivity. Models explaining selectivity based on field strength concept developed by George Eisenman based on Coulomb's law have been applied to KcsA. An alternative explanation for the selectivity of KcsA is based on the close-fit model (also known as the snug- fit model) developed by Benzanilla and Armstrong. The main chain carbonyl oxygen atoms that make up the selectivity filter are held at a precise position that allows them to substitute for water molecules in the hydrated shell of the potassium ion, but they are too far from a sodium ion. Further work has studied thermodynamic differences in ion binding, topological considerations, and the number of continuous ion binding sites. In addition, a major limitation of crystal structure study and simulations has yet to be discussed: the best resolved and most applied crystal structure of KcsA appears to be that of the ‚Äòclosed' form of the channel. This is reasonable as the closed state of the channel is favored at neutral pH, at which the crystal structure was solved by X-ray crystallography. However, the dynamic behavior of KcsA makes analysis of the channel difficult as a crystal structure inevitably provides a static, spatially and temporally averaged image of a channel. To bridge the gap between molecular structure and physiological behavior, an understanding of the atomic resolution dynamics of potassium channels is required.  Applications  Due to the high sequence similarity between the pore of KcsA and other eukaryotic K+ ion channel proteins, KcsA has provided important insight into the behavior of other important voltage conducting proteins such as the drosophilla-derived Shaker and the human hERG potassium channel. KcsA has been used in mutagenesis studies to model the interactions between hERG and various drug compounds. Such tests can screen for drug-hERG channel interactions that cause acquired long QT syndrome, are essential for determining the cardiac safety of new medications. In addition, homology models based on the closed state KcsA crystal structure have been generated computationally to construct a multiple state representation of the hERG cardiac K+ channel. Such models reveal the flexibility of the hERG channel and can consistently predict the binding affinity of a set of diverse ion channel-interacting ligands. Analysis of the complex ligand-hERG structures can be used to guide the synthesis of drug analogs with reduced hERG liability, based on drug structure and docking potential.

It was released on 5 November 2012 in the United Kingdom through Destination Moon, the band's own record label. In interviews, the band described the composition of the album as being much more accessible and direct than their previous albums, while retaining the technical and experimental elements of their typical sound. The album was produced by Jason Sanderson, the producer of Rolo Tomassi's first album Hysterics. This is the band's first release with Chris Cayford and Nathan Fairweather in their line-up after the departure of Joseph Thorpe and Joe Nicholson. The album was recorded in various locations across Nottingham, United Kingdom including James Spence's house and The Bodega club night venue. This was because the band's producer, Sanderson had come into contractual issues with the land owner of his recording studio. The album was critically acclaimed, praised for both its increased accessibility, sonic development and the increased use of Eva Spence's singing. However, the album performed poorly commercially, failing to chart or make significant sales in upon its release. Background Rolo Tomassi only completed one short tour of the United Kingdom in 2011. They spent all the year preparing for their new album and the creation of Destination Moon, the band's own record label. They released a compilation CD, Eternal Youth, in mid-2011 to compile selected works from their numerous split EPs, demos and out-of-print extended plays. When asked about leaving Hassle to form their own record label, the band stated \\"We were questioning what we were doing for our label that we couldn't do ourselves. We've always been very proactive with the running of our band and we've never given away much freedom.\\" The band announced in early February 2012 that both Joseph Thorpe and Joe Nicholson had left the band. This was because Joe Nicholson wanted to read chemistry at university, while Thorpe's reasons were related to personal differences. The band replaced both with Chris Cayford, who is the current frontman and former guitarist of No Coast, and Nathan Fairweather, who plays in Brontide, making this the first release with the new line-up. The title of the album has been cited as having several origins. Some have suggested it gets its name from the Greek goddess of justice Astraea. Another possibility is ASTRAEA, (Autonomous Systems Technology Related Airborne Evaluation & Assessment) an acronym for the development of British unmanned aerial vehicle. The album's title acted as a reference to the Spence siblings' admiration for Greek mythology and a desire to pick a title that made the album \\"sound big and like this proper body of work\\". James Spence described Astraea and the band's previous album Cosmology as being \\"really grand titles\\". Writing and recording Writing for the album started as early as July 2011. James Spence also had stated that in that period the band have at least two songs written with the lyrics being self-reflective, a common theme for the band's music. Around this time as well, Rolo Tomassi expressed interest in working with Anthony Gonzalez or Kurt Ballou respectively of M83 and Converge as producers for the third album. However at the time insufficient progress had been made for them to search for producers. James Spence had said that with this record he wished to experiment with shoegaze, \\"dreamy keyboard[s]\\" and utilising more melodic passages. Spence has also commented that \\"quite progressive synth-based music\\" such as M83 and the horror film soundtracks Goblin have produced acted as influences. Because all the members were working their band schedule round their jobs they had to practice in basic recording rooms and write and record their own ideas. From this the members listened to each other's ideas and gave their interpretations and evaluations. Synthesiser player James felt the band produced their best work with this method as they were constantly assessing themselves. In the writing of previous albums by Rolo Tomassi a majority of the music was written by James and Eva Spence wrote most of the lyrics. For Astraea, the band treated it as a collaboration between all five members; however James and Cayford were the \\"main brains\\". In January 2012, in an interview with Kerrang!, Eva Spence confirmed that the band are self-producing their third full-length with Hysterics producer Jason Sanderson. The choice of returning to Sanderson was because he has been a close friend of the band members for a long time. Regarding the sound of the album, she stated that it will be \\"more direct and heavier\\", but also noted that the band \\"will never shy away from being experimental\\". However, James Spence went on record saying that during the actual production of the album the band did not consider themselves as part of the overall production; rather just having a say in every aspect of the album progress. In April 2012, the NME did a studio update with on the album with James Spence stating that the band's writing was \\"70% complete\\". He credited how the new members Chris and Nathan \\"breathed new life\\" into the band's writing as the original three members had become \\"too set in their ways\\". The band members have commented that this has made the writing a lot more fun as the band no longer writes a song then learns it. As the band wrote Astraea they decided to contrast with their typical style more with the clean and ethereal parts, which led to an increase of Eva's singing. They started recording Astraea in June at James Spence's house in Nottingham. They were forced into this situation as Sanderson's recording studio was taken from him through a contractual issue on the building with the landlord. The recording process was different from previous albums as there was a lot of production and pre-production involved. Sanderson would come to the practice sessions of the bands and make suggestions to the songs and then they would go to record it. The album took three months to record because of band member's personal commitments, this to James Spence had a positive effect as the members took their time with the music, believing the album was more ‚Äúproduced‚Äù than previous efforts. James believed Rolo Tomassi had much more of an opportunity to experiment in the studio and try things they had never tried before. However, James had commented that the recording of the album in his house revealed to be a stressful decision. An example of this was were his basement- where all the recording equipment was- flooded due to heavy rainfall. Although nothing got damaged, stagnant water remained and they had to move the guitar cab to his bedroom. They recorded the drums upstairs at The Bodega in Nottingham then Rolo Tomassi then went to James and Eva Spence's parents house record the vocals, keyboard and pianos. Musical style Much like the band's previous work Astraea is considered primarily as mathcore. This is displayed in the theoretical complexity of their music, such as odd time signatures like 9/13, polyrhythmic drumming and use of dynamics, akin to bands such as Converge, Radiohead and Sigur R√≥s. Their sound is seen as a \\"stylistic schism\\" between \\"Dillinger Escape Plan-esque tech-metalcore, grandstanding prog rock and modish synthesised pop\\" and fusing aesthetics from shoegaze, space rock, ambient, black metal, hardcore punk, jazz, pop, progressive rock and techno. The band is noted for their two vocalists who utilise both screaming and singing vocals, and the album is described as featuring more 'clean vocals' than previous albums. The band's vocal diversity is said to: \\"immediately creates a rich and textured sonic world\\". Eva has been seen as pushing her vocals \\"further than ever before, displaying extremity, contrasted with canorous beauty\\", with her singing voice being compared to the dream pop stylings of Grimes and Cocteau Twins. When Eva Spence has been asked about the album's musical approach, is much more 'hard- hitting' and 'more direct' than previous albums. She was quoted saying that the album is much more accessible than their previous albums: \\"You can get your teeth into it much quicker, people who didn't have patience before with our music before will be into this record. It's still technical, but we're using the mathy bits more sparingly.\\" The album opens out with 'Howl', a grinding, but graceful opener. The song starts with an opening two minutes of intense and spacious drone synthesisers. The following two minutes of the song break into \\"unrelenting and brutal\\" mathcore with Eva Spence making her vocal debut with her \\"gleefully guttural vocal register\\". The song is used as an example of how the band is using more complex, but 'more rewarding' song structures in their music. ‚ÄòEx Luna Scientia‚Äô, the opening single for the album is seen as a more expansive and more melodic song in comparison to their previous work, placing emphasis on Eva Spence‚Äôs singing rather than her trademark 'guttural' style. Rock Sound reviewer Oliver Robertson used the song as an example for the sonic development of the album as it is \\"more focused on making each element stand out now, rather than creating simply a cacophony of noise.\\" The introduction to 'Empiresk' is seen as being \\"completely caked in reverb\\" and ends with a stoner riff. The \\"sparse piano chords\\" that open both 'Empiresk' and 'Prelude II', among the atmospheric breaks that are featured on other tracks on the album defy the aggression featured on the rest of Astraea. Songs like 'The Scales of Balance', 'Remancer' and 'Gloam' are seen as having a familiar style to the Rolo Tomassi's previous work. 'Gloam', specifically the last half of the song, showcases a \\"battle between melodic keyboard[s] and screamed vocals with a real sense of urgency and threat.\\" 'Remancer' specifically has been considered as almost like Mastodon. The album closes with 'Illuminare', a song which Metal Hammer reviewer Merlin Alderslade cites as showing Radiohead and Sigur R√≥s influences. Lyrically, Eva Spence credited on how the Astraea was a lot more positive than their previous material due to having time off between tours and being able to relax in the writing process. \\"I feel happier than I have done in the past few years. I'm seeing things in a positive light and I hope the lyrics will be more uplifting\\" In an interview with James Spence about the early writing process and how the lyrics have an essence of self-reflection as a common theme in the band's work, \\"it's not something people normally look at or focus on; self-reflection as a theme, but if you ignore what's happening to you and how it's making you think about things then I don't think that's good.\\" Release and promotion In early February 2012, Rolo Tomassi announced the release of a new single: 'Old Mystics'. 'Old Mystics' and its B-side 'Mesmerizer' was written by synthesiser play James Spence in the earliest stages of the Astraea's writing, in late 2011. The single was uploaded to the band's Facebook profile to stream for free. They released the single on 26 March. The band announced a few days after releasing \\"Old Mystics\\" for streaming that it will most likely not appear on the new album and will just be a stand-alone single as they felt the two songs did not fit onto Astraea. Rolo Tomassi completed their first tour of the year as the main support for Architects on a 14-date UK tour in April. They used this tour to promote their new single 'Old Mystics' as well as debut other unrecorded new material from the album, such as songs 'Howl' and 'Remancer'. Rolo Tomassi's presence on the tour was met with positive reception; however, reviewers believed the band's music was too aggressive and chaotic for fans of Architects. Tim Sewell when writing for The Courier Online said that: \\"it was apparent that much of the crowd (mostly Architects fans) were left a little confused by singer/shewolf Eva Spence, who flung herself about in front of them screaming.\\" Rolo Tomassi performing in 2012. During the promotion for Astraea the band learned that some songs- particularly 'Gloam'- were difficult to play live. The album's release date was delayed several times. Kerrang! magazine initially announced that Astraea was expected to be released in May. But by April the album was then declared as being released in October. On 16 August 2012, the band issued both the track listing for the album its title, Astraea and unveiled its British release date as 5 November. Before the Astraea's release, they completed an October tour of Britain with support from Oathbreaker and Goodtime Boys and then went on to support the album in Europe in November 2012 which, as a tour was 24 shows in 26 days. One music video and one single spawned out of the release of Astraea. The single was 'Ex Luna Scientia' which was released in September 2012. The music video was for 'Howl' and was released in early March 2013. The aims of Astraea, in James Spence's mind, was to help reach parts of the world they've been unable to tour, like North America and South-east Asia as well as desiring to tour and support the album all of 2013. The band learned their studio output was not as easy to re-create live as it was with previous albums. An example was with the song 'Gloam' as the pedal changes were too rapid for live performances. The band completed a small British tour in January 2013, but in May that year Rolo Tomassi completed another short British tour with Bastions, the band was noted for only costing five pound a ticket for all venues. They picked Bastions as they were aware of them because of their mutual relationship with Holy Roar Records and how their bassist played in Crocus, a band which has played with Rolo Tomassi in the past. Rolo Tomassi's decision of making the shows of the tour only cost five pound was questioned by interviewer Samantha Booth when writing for The National Student, James replied saying it was for the sake of encouraging people to come see them and because of the high prices of concert tickets. The band has hinted that their touring schedule would go \\"further afield\\" than Europe. In September Rolo Tomassi performed on three out of the four dates of the Japanese touring festival Reverberation Festival. In September and October, starting just three days after their Japanese performances Rolo Tomassi completed 13 date tour of Australia with Australian bands Totally Unicorn and Stockades. It is the first time the band has been in the country since 2010. Reception=Critical reception The album received critical acclaim from popular critics. BBC issued a very much favourable review of the album as writer Noel Gardner praised Rolo Tomassi as remaining a \\"remarkably singular band\\" three albums into their career. Drowned In Sound writer Pieter Macmillan commented positively on their use of vocals on the album saying \\"having male and female vocals and the ability to switch from singing to screaming and back again immediately creates a rich and textured sonic world if it‚Äôs done well, as it certainly is here.\\" The Fly magazine gave the album a four out of five star rating summarising the album as \\"blissed-out ecstasy\\". New Musical Express writer Barry Nicolson gave the album an 8 out of 10 and drew parallels between the album titles name, being derived from the Greek goddess of justice by concluding his review with \\"If there is any justice in the world, here‚Äôs an album richly deserving of some.\\" Metal Hammer reviewers praised the album for its increase in 'clean vocals' and less disjointed song writing but still being heavy. John Doran of online magazine The Quietus gave the album a glowing review expecting it to appear in his publicationsend of year lists, describing it in summary as a triumph: \\"Rolo Tomassi are miles ahead of the game not just because they are constantly trying to break new ground but also because they have entered a nuclear arms race of progressiveness with their own back catalogue.\\" Oliver Robertson when writing for Rock Sound magazine gave the album a 7 out of 10 and started his review by praising the band saying \\"deviating little from the blueprint while making some of the finest mathcore albums of the past few years\\". Considering the album as a sign of Rolo Tomassi maturing as a band. Accolades The album earned numerous best-of lists in 2012.

Development The Gamera II is a quadrotor helicopter purpose-designed to attempt an official flight duration record sanctioned by the National Aeronautic Association, and is a step in the progression of designs built to meet the criteria of the 1980 American Helicopter Society Igor I. Sikorsky Human Powered Helicopter Competition. It is the advanced follow-on model of the Gamera I developed the year prior. Two other teams have made Sikorsky Prize attempts unsuccessfully. On June 13, 2013, the University of Toronto Team's AeroVelo Atlas, managed to keep its helicopter in the air for 64.11 seconds, reach a peak altitude of 3.3 meters and drift no more than 9.8 meters from the starting point, claiming the prize. The requirements to win the Sikorsky Prize include achieving a flight duration of 60 seconds and reaching an \\"altitude\\" of . At the same time the aircraft must prove that it is controllable by remaining within a square. Since the University of Maryland's mascot is a terrapin turtle, the craft is named Gamera II, a tribute to popular Japanese Kaiju series of films featuring a flying turtle Gamera. Design Gamera consists of a \\"X\\" shaped fuselage frame using a micro truss structure that helped reduce overall weight by 33 percent from the Gamera I. The transmission, cockpit and rotors have been refined from the original Gamera I. The transmission now includes a flywheel to reduce \\"jerky\\" impulses on the rotors. The rotor weight was reduced by 39 percent by reducing material in the webbing of the triangular truss spars that deflect only 1 ft versus 25 inches on Gamera I. The rotors are now tapered with a Selig S8037 airfoil and rigged with a 3 degree anhedral to compensate for coning so the blades fly almost level with the ground. 35 Percent less power is required to hover the Gamera II than the Gamera I with the same weight pilots. At the terminus of each end of the frame resides a rotor. Each rotor weighs , and the powerplant/pilot weighs to . Power is transferred to the rotors via hand and foot pedals in a pod suspended beneath the structure. Up to 20 percent additional power for the 60 second runtime is achieved using this more complex method rather than pedal power alone. Like a pull-starter on a lawn mower, the transmission spools in a length of Spectra line in order to spin the rotors. There is enough line to spool the rotors 90 seconds. The line needs to be rewound for each effort, but weighs significantly less than a continuous chain or belt drive. The rotors operate in extreme ground effect, a distance of less than five percent of the rotor length from its operating height. Ideal operation is at 90 rpm for the \\"engine\\" and 20 rpm for the rotors. Operational history Construction began in November 2011. On June 20, 2012, Colin Gore flew the Gamera II at the Reckord Armory on the University of Maryland Campus for a duration of 35 seconds, setting a new world record for human powered helicopter flight duration. With engineering improvements, the team bested the Gamera I endurance effort by 24 seconds. One day later, on June 21, 2012, Kyle Gluesenkamp flew the Gamera II for an unofficial world record of 50 seconds. The time will be submitted to the National Aeronautic Association by judge Kris Maynard and the validation process will likely take a few weeks.http://www.agrc.umd.edu/news/news_story.php?id=6589 On August 28, 2012, University of Maryland freshman Henry Enerson flew the Gamera II to a world record height of above ground level.https://news.yahoo.com/blogs/sideshow/air- human-powered-helicopter-212542729.html On August 28, 2012, Colin Gore powered the Gamera II for 65.1 seconds, within a 10-meter x 10-meter area. Two of the three criteria prescribed to meet the American Helicopter Society Sikorsky Prize competition were achieved, with only hover height falling short. Sonar altimeters and a modified transmission were added for the effort. On June 13, 2013, the Canadian AeroVelo Atlas met the criteria for the Sikorsky Prize. On June 26, 2013, the Gamera II set an unofficial world record for human powered helicopter endurance of 74 seconds. On September 25, 2013, pilot Justin Mauch powered Gamera IID (a modified version of Gamera II) for a certified U.S. record and pending world record flight duration of 97.5 seconds. On the same day, female pilot Kay Tsui set a new U.S. record for a flight duration of 38 seconds.

It was built in 1882 to house refugee children. It was later destroyed by fire and a new building was erected on the same site in 1913. The orphanage was closed down in 1940 and the building fell into disrepair after Germany's reunification in 1990. It was acquired and restored by a charitable foundation in 1999 and now houses a school and a district library.  History  The orphanage was originally intended to be a home for refugee children who had escaped the pogroms following the assassination of Emperor Alexander II of Russia in 1881. Due to the fact that many of the children had lost their parents, the Jewish community of Berlin converted the home into an orphanage in 1882. Later it was destroyed by fire, so a new building was erected on the very site following Alexander Beer's plans, who was the architect for the building. Following the November pogroms of 1938 the director of the orphanage, Kurt Crohn succeeded in saving the lives of many children by the means of kindertransports to the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, among these was Leslie Baruch Brent. The orphanage was forcibly closed in 1940 and the last residents were put into concentration camps in 1942. Between 1943 and 1945 the building was used by SS- Reichssicherheitshauptamt for its central endorsement department (). After 1945 the building briefly served the district's administration and East Germany's sports association. Between 1951 and 1971 it housed the embassy of Poland, followed by the embassy of Cuba until 1991. The building fell into disrepair and was acquired from its owner (the state of Israel) by the Dr. Walter and Margarete Cajewitz Foundation in 1999. After extensive restoration, the building has housed the district's Janusz Korczak library since 2001 and also a comprehensive school, SchuleEins, since 2007. The memory of the Jewish orphanage is preserved by an association of friends and sponsors, among these are Jutta Limbach, Wolfgang Thierse and the late Christa Wolf.

It is formed by a coating of carbon on one side of a sheet of paper, giving one black and one white side. Western Union developed Teledeltos paper in the late 1940s (several decades after it was already in use for mathematical modelling) for use in spark printer based fax machines and chart recorders.Grosvenor Hotchkiss, Electrosensitive Recording Paper for Facsimile Telegraph Apparatus and Graphic Chart Instruments, Western Union Technical Review, Vol. 3, No, 1 (January 1949); page 6. Teledeltos paper has several uses within engineering that are far removed from its original use in spark printers. Many of these use the paper to model the distribution of electric and other scalar fields.  Use  Teledeltos provides a sheet of a uniform resistor, with isotropic resistivity in each direction. As it is cheap and easily cut to shape, it may be used to make one-off resistors of any shape needed. The paper backing also forms a convenient insulator from the bench. These are usually made to represent or model some real-world example of a two-dimensional scalar field, where is it is necessary to study the field's distribution. This field may be an electric field, or some other field following the same linear distribution rules. The resistivity of Teledeltos is around 6 kilohms / square. This is low enough that it may be used with safe low voltages, yet high enough that the currents remain low, avoiding problems with contact resistance. Connections are made to the paper by painting on areas of silver-loaded conductive paint and attaching wires to these, usually with spring clips. Each painted area has a low resistivity (relative to the carbon) and so may be assumed to be at a constant voltage. With the voltages applied, the current flow through the sheet will emulate the field distribution. Voltages may be measured within the sheet by applying a voltmeter probe (relative to one of the known electrodes) or current flows may be measured. As the sheet's resistivity is constant, the simplest way to measure a current flow is to use a small two-probe voltmeter to measure the voltage difference between the probes. As their spacing is known, and the resistivity, the resistance between them and (by Ohm's law) the current flow can be easily determined. An assumption in some cases is that the surrounding field is 'infinite', this would also require an infinite sheet of Teledeltos. Provided that the sheet is merely 'large' in comparison to the experimental area, a sheet of finite size is sufficient for most experimental practice.  Field plotting  The basic technique for plotting a field is to first construct a model of the independent variables, then to use voltage meter probes to measure the dependent variables. Typically this means applying known voltages at certain points, then measuring voltages and currents within the model. The two basic approaches are to either applying electrodes and a voltage at known points within a large sheet of Teledeltos (modelling an infinite field) or else to cut a shape from Teledeltos and then apply voltages to its edges (modelling a bounded field). There is a common practical association that electrical field models are usually infinite and thermal models are usually bounded.  Modelling fields by analogy  Although the modelling of electric fields is itself directly useful in some fields such as thermionic valve design, the main practical use of the broader technique is for modelling fields of other quantities. This technique may be applied to any field that follows the same linear rules as Ohm's law for bulk resistivity. This includes heat flow, some optics and some aspects of Newtonian mechanics. It is not usually applicable to fluid dynamics, owing to viscosity and compressibility effects, or to high-intensity optics where non-linear effects become apparent. It may be applicable to some mechanical problems involving homogeneous and isotropic materials such as metals, but not to composites. Before the use of Teledeltos, a similar technique had been used for modelling gas flows, where a shallow tray of copper sulphate solution was used as the medium, with copper electrodes at each side. Barriers within the model could be sculpted from wax. Being a liquid, this was far less convenient. Stanley Hooker describes its use pre-war, although he also notes that compressibility effects could be modelled in this way, by sculpting the base of the tank to give additional depth and thus conductivity locally. One of the most important applications is for thermal modelling. Voltage is the analog of temperature and current flow that of heat flow. If the boundaries of a heatsink model are both painted with conductive paint to form two separate electrodes, each may be held at a voltage to represent the temperatures of some internal heat source (such as a microprocessor chip) and the external ambient temperature. Potentials within the heatsink represent internal temperatures and current flows represent heat flow. In many cases the internal heat source may be modelled with a constant current source, rather than a voltage, giving a better analogy of power loss as heat, rather than assuming a simple constant temperature. If the external airflow is restricted, the 'ambient' electrode may be subdivided and each section connected to a common voltage supply through a resistor or current limiter, representing the proportionate or maximum heatflow capacity of that airstream. As heatsinks are commonly manufactured from extruded aluminium sections, the two-dimensional paper is not usually a serious limitation. In some cases, such as pistons for internal combustion engines, three-dimensional modelling may be required. This has been performed, in a manner analogous to Teledeltos paper, by using volume tanks of a conductive electrolyte. This thermal modelling technique is useful in many branches of mechanical engineering such as heatsink or radiator design and die casting. The development of computational modelling and finite element analysis has reduced the use of Teledeltos, such that the technique is now obscure and the materials can be hard to obtain. Its use is still highly valuable in teaching, as the technique gives a very obvious method for measuring fields and offers immediate feedback as the shape of an experimental setup is changed, encouraging a more fundamental understanding.  Sensors  Teledeltos can also be used to make sensors, either directly as an embedded resistive element or indirectly, as part of their design process.  Resistive sensors  A piece of Teledeltos with conductive electrodes at each end makes a simple resistor. Its resistance is slightly sensitive to applied mechanical strain by bending or compression, but the paper substrate is not robust enough to make a reliable sensor for long-term use. A more common resistive sensor is in the form of a potentiometer. A long, thin resistor with an applied voltage may have a conductive probe slid along its surface. The voltage at the probe depends on its position between the two end contacts. Such a sensor may form the keyboard for a simple electronic musical instrument like a Tannerin or Stylophone. A similar linear sensor uses two strips of Teledeltos, placed face to face. Pressure on the back of one (finger pressure is enough) presses the two conductive faces together to form a lower resistance contact. This may be used in similar potentiometric fashion to the conductive probe, but without requiring the special probe. This may be used as a classroom demonstration for another electronic musical instrument, with a ribbon controller keyboard, such as the Monotron. If crossed electrodes are used on each piece of Teledeltos, a two-dimensional resistive touchpad may be demonstrated.  Capacitive sensors  Although Teledeltos is not used to manufacture capacitive sensors, its field modelling abilities also allow it to be used to determine the capacitance of arbitrarily shaped electrodes during sensor design.

Prior to 1984 there was little suspicion that continental rocks could reach such high pressures. The formation of many UHP terrains has been attributed to the subduction of microcontinents or continental margins and the exhumation of all UHP terrains has been ascribed principally to buoyancy caused by the low density of continental crust‚Äîeven at UHP‚Äîrelative to Earth's mantle. While the subduction proceeds at low thermal gradients of less than 10¬∞C/km, the exhumation proceeds at elevated thermal gradients of 10-30¬∞C/km.

Identification Petrological indicators of UHP metamorphism are usually preserved in eclogite. The presence of metamorphic coesite, diamond, or majoritic garnet are diagnostic; other potential mineralogical indicators of UHP metamorphism, such as alpha-PbO2 structured TiO2, are not widely accepted. Mineral assemblages, rather than single minerals, can also be used to identify UHP rocks; these assemblages include magnesite + aragonite. Because minerals change composition in response to changes in pressure and temperature, mineral compositions can be used to calculate pressure and temperature; for UHP eclogite the best geobarometers involve garnet + clinopyroxene + K-white mica and garnet + clinopyroxene + kyanite + coesite/quartz.Ravna, E.

G., 2007, Petrotectonics of ultrahigh- pressure crustal and upper-mantle rocks: Implications for Phanerozoic collisional orogens: Geological Society of America Special Paper, v. 433, p. 27-49. The giant UHP terrains have a metamorphic history spanning tens of millions of years, whereas the small UHP terrains have a metamorphic history spanning millions of years.Kylander-Clark, A., Hacker, B., and Mattinson, C., 2012, Size and exhumation rate of ultrahigh-pressure terrains linked to orogenic stage: Earth and Planetary Science Letters, v. 321-322, p. 115-120. All are dominated by quartzofeldspathic gneiss with a few percent mafic rock (eclogite) or ultramafic rock (garnet-bearing peridotite). Some include sedimentary or rift-volcanic sequences that have been interpreted as passive margins prior to metamorphism.Oberh√§nsli, R., Martinotti, G., Schmid, R., and Liu, X., 2002, Preservation of primary volcanic textures in the ultrahigh- pressure terrain of Dabie Shan: Geology, v. 30, p. 609‚Äì702.Hollocher, K., Robinson, P., Walsh, E., and Terry, M., 2007, The Neoproterozoic Ottfj√§llet dike swarm of the Middle Allochthon, traced geochemically into the Scandian hinterland, Western Gneiss region, Norway: American Journal of Science, v. 307, p. 901-953. Implications and importance UHP rocks record pressures greater than those that prevail within Earth's crust. Earth's crust is a maximum of 70‚Äì80 km thickness, and pressures at the base are <2.7 GPa for typical crustal densities. UHP rocks therefore come from depths within Earth's mantle. UHP rocks of a wide variety of compositions have been identified as both regional metamorphic terrains and xenoliths. UHP ultramafic xenoliths of mantle affinity provide information (e.g., mineralogy or deformation mechanisms) about processes active deep in Earth. UHP xenoliths of crustal affinity provide information about processes active deep in Earth, but also information about what kinds of crustal rocks reach great depth in Earth and how profound those depths are. Regional metamorphic UHP terrains exposed on Earth's surface provide considerable information that is not available from xenoliths. Integrated study by structural geologists, petrologists, and geochronologists has provided considerable data on how the rocks deformed, the pressures and temperatures of metamorphism, and how the deformation and metamorphism varied as a function of space and time. It has been postulated that small UHP terrains that underwent short periods of metamorphism formed early during continent subduction, whereas giant UHP terrains that underwent long periods of metamorphism formed late during continent collision. Formation of UHP rocks Eclogite-facies HP to UHP metamorphic rocks are produced by subduction of crustal rocks to the lower crust to mantle depths for extreme metamorphism at the low thermal gradients of less than 10¬∞C/km.Zheng, Y.-F., Chen, R.-X., 2017. Regional metamorphism at extreme conditions: Implications for orogeny at convergent plate margins. Journal of Asian Earth Sciences, v. 145, p. 46-73. All of these rocks occur at convergent plate margins, and UHP rocks only occur in collisional orogens. There is general agreement that most well-exposed and well-studied UHP terrains were produced by the burial of crustal rocks to mantle depths of >80 km during subduction. Continental margin subduction is well documented in a number of collisional orogens, such as the Dabie orogen where South China Block passive- margin sedimentary and volcanic sequences are preserved,Schmid, R., Romer, R. L., Franz, L., Oberh√§nsli, R., and Martinotti, G., 2003, Basement-Cover Sequences within the UHP unit of the Dabie Shan: Journal of Metamorphic Geology, v. 21, p. 531-538. in the Arabian continental margin beneath the Samail ophiolite (in the Al Hajar Mountains, Oman),Searle, M.

S., and Molnar, P., 1993, Geological and geophysical evidence for deep subduction of continental crust beneath the Pamir: Geological Society of America Special Paper, v. 281, p. 1-76. Subduction erosion also occurs beneath volcanoplutonic arcs around the world, carrying continental rocks to mantle depths at least locally.Hacker, B. R., Luffi, P., Lutkov, V., Minaev, V., Ratschbacher, L., Plank, T., Ducea, M., Pati√±o-Douce, A., McWilliams, M., and Metcalf, J., 2005, Near-ultrahigh pressure processing of continental crust: Miocene crustal xenoliths from the Pamir: Journal of Petrology, v. 46, p. 1661-1687. Exhumation of UHP rocks The specific processes by which UHP terrains were exhumed to Earth's surface appear to have been different in different locations. If continental lithosphere is subducted because of its attachment to downgoing oceanic lithosphere, the downward slab pull force may exceed the strength of the slab at some time and location, and necking of the slab initiates.van Hunen, J., and Allen, M. B., 2011, Continental collision and slab break-off: A comparison of 3-D numerical models with observations: Earth and Planetary Science Letters, v. 302, p. 27-37. The positive buoyancy of the continental slab‚Äîin opposition principally to ridge push‚Äîcan then drive exhumation of the subducting crust at a rate and mode determined by plate geometry and the rheology of the crustal materials. The Norwegian Western Gneiss Region is the archetype for this exhumation mode, which has been termed 'eduction' or subduction inversion.Andersen, T. B., Jamtveit, B., Dewey, J. F., and Swensson, E., 1991, Subduction and eduction of continental crust: major mechanism during continent-continent collision and orogenic extensional collapse, a model based on the south Caledonides: Terra Nova, v. 3, p. 303-310. If a plate undergoing subduction inversion begins to rotate in response to changing boundary conditions or body forces, the rotation may exhume UHP rocks toward crustal levels. This could occur if, for example, the plate is small enough that continental subduction markedly changes the orientation and magnitude of slab pull or if the plate is being consumed by more than one subduction zone pulling in different directions. Such a model has also been proposed for the UHP terrain in eastern Papua New Guinea, where rotation of the Woodlark microplate is causing a rift in the Woodlark Basin). If a subducting plate consists of a weak buoyant layer atop a stronger negatively buoyant layer, the former will detach at the depth where the buoyancy force exceeds slab pull, and extrude upward as a semi-coherent sheet. This type of delamination and stacking was proposed to explain exhumation of UHP rocks in the Dora Maira massif in Piedmont, Italy,Chopin, C., 1987, Very- high-pressure metamorphism in the western Alps: implications for subduction of continental crust: Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A-Mathematical Physical And Engineering Sciences, v. 321, p. 183-197. in the Dabie orogen,Okay, A. I., and Seng√∂r, A. M. C., 1992, Evidence for intracontinental thrust-related exhumation of the ultrahigh-pressure rocks in China: Geology, v. 20, p. 411‚Äì414. and in the Himalaya.Wilke, F. D. H. et al., 2010, Multi-stage reaction history in different eclogite types from the Pakistan Himalaya and implications for exhumation processes. Lithos, v. 114, p. 70-85. In addition it was demonstrated with analogue experiments.Chemenda, A. I., Mattauer, M., Malavieille, J., and Bokun, A. N., 1995, A mechanism for syn-collisional rock exhumation and associated normal faulting: Results from physical modelling: Earth and Planetary Science Letters, v. 132, p. 225-232. This mechanism is different from flow in a subduction channel in that the exhuming sheet is strong and remains undeformed. A variant of this mechanism, in which the exhuming material undergoes folding, but not wholescale disruption, was suggested for the Dabie orogen,where exhumation-related stretching lineations and gradients in metamorphic pressure indicate rotation of the exhuming block;Hacker, B. R., Ratschbacher, L., Webb, L. E., McWilliams, M., Ireland, T. R., Calvert, A., Dong, S., Wenk, H.-R., and Chateigner, D., 2000, Exhumation of ultrahigh-pressure continental crust in east‚Äìcentral China: Late Triassic‚ÄìEarly Jurassic tectonic unroofing: Journal of Geophysical Research, v. 105, p. 13339‚Äì13364. The buoyancy of a microcontinent locally slows the rollback of and steepens the dip of subducting mafic lithosphere.Brun, J.-P., and Faccenna, C., 2008, Exhumation of high-pressure rocks driven by slab rollback: Earth and Planetary Science Letters, v. 272, p. 1-7. If the mafic lithosphere on either side of the microcontinent continues to roll back, a buoyant portion of the microcontinent may detach, allowing the retarded portion of the mafic slab to roll quickly back, making room for the UHP continental crust to exhume and driving back-arc extension. This model was developed to explain repeated cycles of subduction and exhumation documented in the Aegean and Calabria‚ÄìApennine orogens. UHP exhumation by slab rollback has not yet been extensively explored numerically, but it has been reproduced in numerical experiments of Apennine-style collisions.Faccenda, M., Gerya, T. V., and Burlini, L., 2009, Deep slab hydration induced by bending-related variations in tectonic pressure: Nature Geoscience, v. DOI: 10.1038/NGEO656. If continental material is subducted within a confined channel, the material tends to undergo circulation driven by tractions along the base of the channel and the relative buoyancy of rocks inside the channel;Zheng, Y.F., Zhao, Z.F., Chen, Y.X., 2013. Continental subduction channel processes: Plate interface interaction during continental collision. Chinese Science Bulletin 58, 4371-4377. the flow can be complex, generating nappe-like or chaotically mixed bodies.Burov, E., Jolivet, L., Le Pourhiet, L., and Poliakov, A., 2001, A thermomechanical model of exhumation of high pressure (HP) and ultrahigh pressure (UHP) metamorphic rocks in Alpine-type collision belts: Tectonophysics, v. 342, p. 113-136.Gerya, T.

The material within the channel can be exhumed if: # continuous introduction of new material into the channel driven by traction of the subducting plate pushes old channel material upward; # buoyancy in the channel exceeds subduction-related traction and the channel is pushed upward by the asthenospheric mantle intruding between the plates; or # a strong indenter squeezes the channel and extrudes the material within. Buoyancy alone is unlikely to drive exhumation of UHP rocks to Earth's surface, except in oceanic subduction zones.Hacker, B.R., 2007. Ascent of the ultrahigh-pressure Western Gneiss Region, Norway.

Arrest and spreading of UHP rocks at the Moho (if the overlying plate is continental) is likely unless other forces are available to force the UHP rocks upward. Some UHP terrains might be coalesced material derived from subduction erosion.Gerya, T. V., and St√∂ckhert, B., 2006, Two-dimensional numerical modeling of tectonic and metamorphic histories at active continental margins: International Journal of Earth Sciences, v. 95, p. 250-274. This model was suggested to explain the North Qaidam UHP terrain in western China. Even subducted sediment may rise as diapirs from the subducting plate and accumulate to form UHP terrains.Currie, C.

Diapiric rise of a much larger subducted continental body has been invoked to explain the exhumation of the Papua New Guinea UHP terrain.Little, T. A., Hacker, B. R., Gordon, S. M., Baldwin, S.

C., 2007, Characteristics of, and a Tectonic Model for, Ultrahigh-Pressure Metamorphism in the Overriding Plate of the Caledonian Orogen: International Geology Review, v. 49, p. 777-797. However, the mantle wedge above continental subduction zones is cold like cratons, which do not allow for diapirically ascending of the crustal materials.

Helen was portrayed by Janet Munro in the 1968 TV adaptation and Tara FitzGerald in the 1996 miniseries. Biography Helen Lawrence was born in 1802 (or in the first half of 1803) at Wildfell Hall. Rachel, later her maid and friend, takes care of infant Helen. Her mother dies when Helen is still too young to remember her. Immediately after that, her father, unwilling to take any care of a girl, sends Helen to her aunt, Mrs. Peggy Maxwell, at Staningley Hall. At the age of eighteen Helen enters her first season, where she meets witty and handsome Arthur Huntingdon. She falls in love with him and eventually marries him, in spite of all his faults and strong disapproval of her aunt. Helen is firmly convinced that she can reform Arthur with gentle persuasion and good example. One year after their marriage Helen gives birth to their son, also named Arthur, often referred to in the novel as Little Arthur. Huntingdon, who doesn't like his baby, becomes increasingly jealous of him and his claims on Helen's attentions and affections. He spends even more time with his dissolute friends and eventually begins an affair with Lady Lowborough. Walter Hargrave, Helen's unwanted admirer, tells her about it. Nevertheless, Helen plans to run away from Huntingdon and, therefore, violate the law, only when he begins to encourage their son to drink and swear at his early age. Unfortunately, Huntingdon learns of Helen's plans from her journal and burns her artist's tools (by which she had hoped to support herself). Unable to run away to America as she planned before, Helen, with help from her brother, Frederick, finds a secret refuge at Wildfell Hall. She lives there under an assumed name: Helen Graham (Graham is her mother's maiden name). There she meets Gilbert Markham, a young farmer who falls in love with her. When he begins to believe the filthy gossip that is spread about her, she gives him her diary. From it Gilbert learns than Helen is a runaway wife. Soon after this, Helen goes back to Grassdale Manor where she discovers that Huntingdon has fallen from his horse (in a state of inebriation) and is badly injured. As he is unwilling to stop drinking alcohol, Arthur's health deteriorates and he eventually dies. Now unburdened by her marriage to Arthur, Helen and Gilbert marry and have at least two children together. By the end of the novel, Little Arthur is grown up and is residing at Grassdale Manor with his wife, Helen Hattersley (the daughter of Milicent Hargrave and Ralph Hattersley). Appearance Helen is described by Gilbert in the first chapter of the novel when he sees her at church: Later he revealed that her eyes were very dark grey, almost black and a 'large, clear and full of soul'.

The church was notable for the frescoes created in the 14th century. The church was destroyed to the ground during World War II and restored in 1970. Fragments of the frescoes have since been reconstructed. The church is located east of Veliky Novgorod, on the right bank of the Maly Volkhovets River. The Transfiguration Church in Kovalyovo was designated an architectural monument of federal significance (#5310100000). History The church was built as the katholikon of the small Kovalyovo Monastery. It was commissioned around 1345 by a boyar named Ontsifor Zhabin. The southern annex is thought to have been designed as the burial vault of the Zhabin family. The frescoes were painted ca. 1380. During the Second World War, between 1941 and 1943, the church was destroyed. After the war, the ruins were conserved. In the 1960s, fragments of the frescoes were restored. Only originally survived, but the restorers (led by Alexander Grekov and Valentina Grekova) managed to retrieve about of frescoes from the debris. In 1970, the church was rebuilt to a design by Leonid Krasnorechyev. Architecture The church is constructed in brick, and has one dome. It has a single apse and four square columns. This design is typical for pre-Mongol Novgorod churches. There are two auxiliary chapels of different size flanking the main building from the south and from the north. The south chapel has a set of limestone crosses inserted in the walls. The system of vault roofing features three semicircular wall gables (zakomara) which hark back to the pre-Mongol period. The pillars are square rather than circular or octagonal, as was typical for the 14th century. Frescoes The frescoes, created ca. 1380, covered the apse, the inner surface of the dome, the southern and the northern walls of the church, some of the pillars, and the interior of the western chapel. They were sponsored by Afanasy Stepanovich and his wife. The frescoes are thought to have been painted by a team of Balkan (possibly Serbian) painters. Their static and hieratic style has little in common with other Novgorodian frescoes of the period; but it shares similarities with the older Byzantine tradition. The total area of the frescoes was . The interior of the dome was filled with images of the prophets. But it is the images of warrior saints that predominate. This is usually explained by the fact that in the 1370s the Grand Duchy of Moscow, with the support of other Russian states, was preparing to fight against the Golden Horde, culminating in 1380 with the Battle of Kulikovo. There is also the first Russian image of the dead Jesus Christ in the tomb.

Voters chose eight representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president. Arizona was won by incumbent President George H. W. Bush (R-Texas) with 38.47% of the popular vote over Governor Bill Clinton (D-Arkansas) with 36.52%. Businessman Ross Perot (I-Texas) finished in third, with 23.79% of the popular vote. Clinton ultimately won the national vote, defeating incumbent President Bush.

Originally formed in 1997 as Transamerica Municipal Finance (TMF), a division of Transamerica Corporation. In August 2000 the founders completed a form of a management buyout of TMF, creating ATF. ATF currently buys and services real estate tax liens in over 14 states and has provided over $1 billion in relief to local governments. Many ATF tax liens are secured by either Wells Fargo Foot Hill or the Harris Nesbitt Corporation. The process of privatizing the municipal tax foreclosures process and outsourcing to out of state third party, for-profit, private companies has drawn criticism from housing advocates who argue that a for-profit tax foreclosure process leads to more foreclosures, displacement and vacancy. The other argument is that third party purchases of tax liens enables local governments to pay for essential services such as salaries for teachers, health care, police officers and firefighters. To date, no study has shown that the sale of tax liens to third parties leads to any increase in foreclosure activity. In fact, the sale of liens to third party purchasers often extends redemption periods and allows flexible repayment agreements for delinquent tax payers. ATF News & Controversies Between 2006 and 2008, the City of Syracuse sold American Tax Funding (\\"ATF\\") their pool of delinquent City and County tax liens upon roughly 1,900 properties for $12.9 million. Essentially, ATF paid the City of Syracuse $0.87 on the dollar, which was typically more than the City could collect upon these back taxes, and also assumed the liability of collecting and enforcing on these unpaid obligations, some of which were over a decade old. Initially, City Officials were \\"elated\\" to receive $4.5 million for their portion of the liens, but in January 2008 the City of Syracuse refused to sell ATF any subsequent liens and in December 2008, the City sent notice of default to ATF, citing in part that ATF had allowed already vacant properties to further deteriorate and had also refused to pay about $79,000 in back taxes upon half a dozen properties it had recently come to own through tax lien foreclosure and were actively marketing to local investors. In response to the City's notice of default, ATF filed notice of a $6.1 million lawsuit against the City of Syracuse claiming that the City breached their contract and asking City Officials to address a variety of complaints. One such complaint alleged that the City of Syracuse Code Enforcement Department targeted properties that ATF had recently foreclosed for violations and demolition, which caused outrage for Syracuse home buyers who were hoping to rehab these properties but were ultimately caught in the crossfire. The outcome of the legal proceedings between the City of Syracuse and ATF is still pending. In Youngstown, Ohio, Pig Iron Press business owner alleged that ATF foreclosed upon his business without giving him recourse to challenge the action or offer repayment options. According to public record, in 2010 ATF did file a foreclosure action on both the owner's Youngstown business address and his personal residence in Boardman, Ohio, due to back taxes not paid from 2007 to 2009. Contrary to the published reports, ATF did indeed through its attorney offer a repayment plan to the owner, however, he did not believe that he was obligated to pay taxes and also filed bankruptcy, a claim which he later withdrew. ATF has a history of offering repayment plans in Ohio. In Louisville, Kentucky homeowners and housing advocates argue that third party lien purchasers can charge excessive fees. According to public records ATF does not profit from any fees in fact all fees are charged in connection of the servicing or foreclosure of the liens as allowed by statute. Between 2004 and 2009, the City of Schenectady received $43 million from American Tax Funding for their unpaid back taxes. However, in 2012, the City of Schenectady would not sell its liens to ATF and instead, initiated its own foreclosure action upon the 2010 and 2011 liens. In response, ATF sued the City of Schenectady as \\"the city's threatened foreclosure action would preclude ATF's foreclosures, would preclude ATF from collecting on the payment plans that it has in place with numerous property owners, and would also preclude ATF from purchasing subsequent tax liens pursuant to its right of first refusal under the contract.\\" The City of Schenectady then sued American Tax Funding for the right to continue its foreclosure action. To complicate matters, in 2006 the City of Schenectady sold ATF multiple invalid tax liens filed inadvertently by the City on various non-for profits, such as a Hindu Temple and various churches. The City admits that the liens were inappropriately assessed and sold but \\"doesn't want to pay the nonprofits' roughly $280,000 bill.\\" Litigation between the City and ATF is still pending, along with the settlement resolution of the non-for profit liens. In a rather unusual case in Rochester, New York, ATF foreclosed upon a property with $39,000 in back taxes and years of code violations which were included in these property taxes. As authorized by State of New York, municipalities may treat code violation fines as part of unpaid base property taxes and subsequently sell these liens to third party investors, such as ATF. In this case, the owners defended themselves in court against the foreclosure and claimed they were \\"Moorish American Aboriginals, changed their last name...and argued that the house was within the Iroquois territory of the Moorish Empire,\\" thus, they were tax exempt. The defense was eventually dismissed by a judge, but the practice of including code violations in property tax has elicited protests from homeowners who have delinquent tax liens and code violations, along with community groups in Rochester, NY. Alternatively, it may be argued that including unpaid code enforcement fines in property tax bills may be seen as an effort to preserve and enhance the value of City neighborhoods, and to protect the safety, health and welfare of its citizens. According to the City Treasurer, \\"Rochester is perfectly happy in its relationship with ATF.\\" ReferencesSee also * Tax lien sale * Foreclosure * Tax taking * Tax deed sale * Privatization Companies based in Palm Beach County, Florida ","title":"American Tax Funding"},{"id":"36081261","text":"Portrait of Maspons y Labr√≥s by Ramon Casas, conserved at MNAC in Barcelona.

The station began broadcasting at 07.56 am on Thursday, 1 July 1993. The original Station Manager and Programme Controller was John Barnes, the original Sales Manager was Lisa Price. Live programmes initially ran between 0700 - 1900, with the Supergold service from the Chiltern Radio Network overnight. The station increased local hours to 2100 a few months after going on air. Maldwyn was the only station outside the Chiltern-owned stations that made full use of the automation service available on Supergold to insert local news, commercials and features within network programming. Maldwyn broadcast the Network News service provided by Chiltern Radio before switching to IRN when Network News closed. Originally a local station formed as a community co-operative, Radio Maldwyn became a Limited Company in the late 1990s, with original shareholders having 51% of the new company and 49% owned by Murfin Music International, owners of Sunshine 855 in Ludlow, South Shropshire and Sunshine FM in Hereford and Monmouth.

Although monodominance is studied across different regions, most research focuses on the many prominent species in tropical forests. Connel and Lowman, originally called it single-dominance.Connel, Joseph H.; Lowman, Margaret D. (1989). \\"Low diversity tropical rainforests: Some possible mechanisms for their existence.\\". The American Naturalist 134: 88‚Äì119. Conventional explanations of biodiversity in tropical forests in the decades prior to Connel and Lowman's work either ignored monodominance entirely or predicted that it would not exist.Torti, Sylvia D.; Coley, Phyllis D.; Kursar, Thomas A. (February 2001). \\"Causes and Consequences of Monodominance in Tropical Lowland Forests\\". The American Naturalist 157 (2): 141‚Äì153. doi:10.1086/318629. Connel and Lowman hypothesized two contrasting mechanisms by which dominance can be attained. The first is by fast regrowth in unstable habitats with high disturbance rates. The second is through competitive exclusion in stable habitats that have low disturbance rates. Explanations of persistent monodominace include the monodominant species being more resistant than others to seasonal flooding, or that the monodominance is simply a sere. With persistent monodominance, the monodominant species successfully remains so from generation to generation.  Examples  A minimum of 22 species from eight different families are known to create monodominant forests. Examples of persistent monodominance are seen in Africa, Central and South America, and Asia.Torti, Sylvia D.; Coley, Phyllis D.

Dipterocarpaceae is one example of a plant family that is recognized as persistently dominant in Asia. The ectomycorrhizal tree Dicymbe corymbosa, found in central Guyana, creates wide ranges of monodominant forests containing more than 80% of the canopy tree species.McGuire, Krista L. \\"Ectomycorrhizal Associations Function to Maintain Tropical Monodominance.\\" Mycorrhizae: Sustainable Agriculture and Forestry. Z.A. Siddiqui, et al. Netherlands: Springer Science + Business Media B.V., 2008. 287-302. Print. Dominant plants in the Neotropics and Africa are usually in the family Leguminosae. The species Gilbertiodendron dewevrei, Cynometra alexandri, and Julbernardia seretii are pronounced as exclusive dominants in their individual forests in equatorial Africa.Hart, T. B., Hart, J. A., & Murphy, P. G. (1989). Monodominant and species-rich forests of the humid tropics: causes for their co-occurrence. American Naturalist, 613-633.

This species in the Ituri forest forms monodominant stands that occupy more than 90% of the canopy trees. View from the top, Falealupo Rainforest canopy walkway, Savaii, Samoa 2009  Causes  Connel and Lowman originally hypothesized ectomycorrhizal association causing the replacement of other species as one of two mechanisms by which a species becomes persistently monodominant; the other is the simple colonization of large gaps. However, subsequent research over the years has shown that there is not a single, simple mechanism by which monodominance occurs.Hart, Terese (January 1990). \\"Monospecific dominance in tropical rain forests.\\". Trends in Ecology and Evolution (Elsevier Ltd) 5 (1): 6‚Äì11.doi:10.1016/0169-5347(90)90005-X.Read, Jennifer; Hallam, Patricia; Cherrier, Jean-Fran√ßois (1995). \\"The anomaly of monodominant tropical rainforests: some preliminary observations in the Nothofagus-dominated rainforests of New Caledonia\\".

Journal of Tropical Ecology 23 (3): 297‚Äì307.doi:10.1017/s0266467406003968. Monodominant species have been recorded forming at various times after forest clearance, though this has not been shown to be a predictor of monodominant species persistence. Reliance upon ectomycorrhizae and poor soils have not been demonstrated. Instead, multiple traits of adult monodominant species hinder the ability of other species to grow, including a dense canopy, a uniform canopy, deep leaf litter, slow nutrient processing, mast fruiting, and poor dispersal. Several causal mechanisms have been proposed for the formation of monodominant forest in tropical ecosystems, including features of the environment such as low disturbance rates, and intrinsic characteristics of the dominant species: escape from herbivores, high seedling shade-tolerance, and the formation of mycorrhizal networks between individuals of the same species.McGuire, K. L. 2007. Common ectomycorrhizal networks may maintain monodominance in a tropical rain forest\\" Ecology 88(3) 567‚Äì574.  Canopy  The dense canopy of the adult trees prevents light from getting into the understory. In the Ituri Forest of the Democratic Republic of the Congo a monodominant Gilbertiodendron forest understory only receives 0.57% full sunlight while a mixed-forest understory received 1.15% full sunlight. This difference may prohibit many plant species from living in that environment due to the low light conditions and their resulting inability to sufficiently and effectively photosynthesize. Even some species that are more shade tolerant cannot survive the severe low light conditions.  Leaf-litter  Leaf litter A monodominant forest has generally very deep leaf litter because the leaves are not decomposing as quickly as in other forests. In some monodominant forests the decomposition rates can be two to three times slower than mixed forests. Low ammonium and nitrate could be the result of this slow decomposition which in turn, means less nutrients in the soil for other plant species to use.  Nutrient processing  Nutrient processing is somewhat different from one forest to another. In the Gilbertiodendron forests there is low availability of nitrogen due to the low levels in the leaves that fall to the ground and the slow decomposition. This could prevent other plant species from colonizing because the soil lacks necessary nutrients. In Parashorea chinensis forests, trees are known to require more fertile soils than in other areas. There is a large amount of manganese though that prevents other plants from taking root. Manganese can poison other trees if the levels are too high and possibly cause leaf chlorosis and necrosis and prevent the nutrient uptake of calcium and magnesium.Van der Velden, N., Ferry Slik, J. W., Hu, Y. H., Lan, G., Lin, L., Deng, X., & Poorter, L. (2014). \\"Monodominance of Parashorea chinensis on fertile soils in a Chinese tropical rain forest\\". Journal of Tropical Ecology, 30(04), 311-322.  Mast fruiting  Mast fruiting is a mass fruiting event that overwhelms the animals that consume fruit and helps the seeds' survival rate. Well-defended leaves also assist in the prevention of predation. In the Gilbertiodendron forests this mast fruiting does not assist in lesser predation, but in Asia and the Neotropics this does induce fitness benefits and sometimes is actually important to monodominant maintenance.  Poor dispersal  A monodominant forest has poor dispersal because of the lack of animal dispersers, so many of the seeds are just dropped from the parent tree and fall to the ground where they germinate. This can create a regular and radial path around the parent tree that results in a \\"tree-by-tree replacement\\" in a mixed forest. In a monodominant forest the dominant species do not need all of the described traits to overwhelm the area. Though many have a combination, all monodominant forests have at least one of these traits to create the monodominant habitat.  Ectomycorrhizal association  Many of the tropical monodominant trees are associated with ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi networks. Mycorrhizal fungi are known to effect plant diversity trends in a variety of ecosystems around the world. Ectomycorrhizal relations with trees can increase nutrient supplies through a more effectual use of larger capacities of soils or through the direct decomposition of leaf litter. This has been suggested to provide a competitive advantage to such tree species. Examples of ectomycorrhizal trees in tropical rainforests can be found in Asia, Africa, and the Neotropics. There is a strong correlation between the ECM association in tropical trees and the occurrence of monodominance. Fungi like mycorrihizae appear not to harm the leaves and even display a symbiotic relationship.Arnold, A. E., and F. Lutzoni. 2007. Diversity and host range of folier fungal endophytes: Are tropical leaves biodiversity hotspots? Ecology 88: 541-549. ECM fungi are derived from saprotrophs and retain some ability to decompose organic material. Because tropical soils are often nutrient-poor, ECM trees are predicted to have a competitive advantage over neighboring trees because of their ability to attain more nutrients. With time this could lead to dominance in a tropical rainforest. = Ectomycorrhizal mediated mechanisms = A study of Dicymbe corymbosa individuals show that (in terms of total basal area) the adult trees dominate resources and space. Additionally, they form coppices, also known as epicormic shoots, which allow their perseverance over time. Hence, if one stem of the tree dies, it is replaced by another living stem in the canopy. This creates same-species regrowth at stem level. All of this requires high levels of carbohydrates and nutrients that are accumulated from the ECM association. There is evidence that masting tree species rely on ECM associations to accumulate these requisite nutrients for reproduction during inter-mast years. Associations between resource levels stowed in plant tissue, timing of masting, and ECM patterns propose that ECM fungi are essential in the procurement of nutrients required for large masting trees. Seeds of monodominant trees typically have higher rates of germination and seedling survival when planted in monodominant forests rather than mixed forests. Monodominant seedlings planted in mixed forests have significantly lower levels of ECM colonization of roots. The lower percent of ECM colonization can cause the low survival rates of these seedlings in mixed forest. Another mechanism that can be important for seedling and growth survival is a connection to a common ECM network. By connecting their small root systems to ECM networks that emanate from larger adults, more benefits can be received. Slower decomposition rates in monodominant forests have been hypothesized to be a result of competition between saprotrophic bacteria and fungi. ECM fungi may be suppressing saprotrophs in the monodominant forest to slow decomposition and return organically bound nutrients back to the tree. This is also called the \\"Gadgil\\" hypothesis.  Ecological impacts  All of the traits that contribute to creating a monodominant forest over time hinder the growth of other plant species and force them to move to a more mixed forest. Even though this is inconvenient for the plant species that were there, there has not been any evidence that suggests that this is a negative effect of monodominance. Monodominant forests are also found to have significantly less nitrogen in their soil than mixed forests. In these monodominant forests there are a lot of dominant tree species from the legume family that have nitrogen fixation. Nitrogen fixation creates compounds that help a plant to grow in otherwise low nutrient conditions.Brookshire, E. J., & Thomas, S. A. (2013).

The self-declared fireworks capital of Mexico is Tultepec, just north of Mexico City. Although the main ingredient for fireworks, gunpowder, was brought by the conquistadors in the 16th century, fireworks became popular in Mexico in the 19th century. Today, it is Latin America‚Äôs second largest producer, almost entirely for domestic use, with products ranging from small firecrackers to large shells and frames for pyrotechnics called ‚Äúcastillos‚Äù (castles) and ‚Äútoritos‚Äù (little bulls). The industry is artisanal, with production concentrated in family-owned workshops and small factories with a number operating illegally. The relatively informal production and sales of fireworks have made it dangerous with a number of notable accidents in from the late 1990s to the present, despite attempts to safety regulations. History A \\"torito\\" or bull frame for fireworks on display at the Museo de Arte Popular in Mexico City Although pre Hispanic cultures had ways of manipulating fire for ceremonial purposes, the popularity of fireworks came to Mexico late, in the 19th century. Fireworks were invented by the Chinese, and for ceremonial and religious use, which is their main use today in Mexico. Fireworks production and use came to Mexico through Europe. The main ingredient for them, gunpowder, came with the conquistadors but for military purposes. The first place to start gunpowder manufacture was Tultepec, which during the colonial period was separate from Mexico City and had an abundance of saltpeter, from which the chemicals could be extracted. The popularity of fireworks begin in the 19th century, after Mexico‚Äôs independence. Fireworks production, sale and handling is covered by the federal Armas, Municiones, Explosivas y Pirotecnia law, with the aim of reducing the risk associated with the product. This law was enacted in 1963, more geared towards the military. Recent efforts to update the law have included providing training and other measures to extend legal status to irregular manufacturers. Fireworks are a main staple of Mexican religious festivals, especially those for patron saints. However, the main occasion for fireworks use are the celebrations surrounding Mexican Independence, which begins with the reenactment of Father Hidalgo‚Äôs cry against the Spanish at 11pm on September 15, 1810. The fireworks are ignited just after the reenactment. Manufacture A castle frame for fireworks on display at the Museo de Arte Popular in Mexico City Portions of a \\"castillo\\" or castle fireworks frame set off at the National Fireworks Fair in Tultepec In Latin America, Mexico is the second largest producer of fireworks, after Brazil. There are over 50,000 families in Mexico which manufacture fireworks, many illegally, with 40,000 families in sixty municipalities in the State of Mexico alone. Many of these artisans are located in the municipalities of Almoloya de Ju√°rez, Axapusco, Tianguistenco, Tenancingo, Tenango del Valle, Otumba, Capulhuac, Coyotepec, Tec√°mac and Texcoco, along with the community of San Mateo Otzacatipan. However, the biggest producer is the municipality of Tultepec, located just north of Mexico City, which accounts for 25% of all the fireworks produced in Mexico. There are three internationally recognized pyrotechnic enterprises in Mexico. Lux Pirotecnia is located in Zumpango, known for its rigorous manufacturing methods and participation in international competitions in Europe and Canada. Pirotecnia Reyes won first place at the International Fireworks Competition in Hannover, Germany in 2011 with a fireworks and music show lasting 25 minutes. This enterprise was founded by Manues Reyes Arias who received the 1996 Premio Nacional de las Artes . Most artisans are trained by their elders with no formal training or formal degrees in chemistry or engineering, although some have abroad for training as well to promote products. Artisans buy ingredients in local chemical supply shops and local markets, which are then mixed by hand in family owned workshops and small factories. Everything is made from scratch, with cartridges made of packing tape and scrap paper purchased in bulk. Often, the fireworks are packaged in nothing but old cornmeal and dog food bags. Most artisans are not formal employees, but rather work in the family business. The formulas used by each workshop are individual and guarded by the families that own them. Workshops are ranked with the best artisans receiving the ‚Äúmaestro‚Äù (master) title, able to produce elaborate products such as castillos, bombas, toritos and synchronized fireworks/light/music shows. Mexican firework production include a number of explosive objects such as ‚Äúrocas‚Äù (rocks, a kind of powerful firecracker), ‚Äúvampiros‚Äù (vampires), ‚Äúpatas de mula‚Äù (mule hooves) and ‚Äúbombas‚Äù (large rockets) as well as frames with pyrotechnics called ‚Äúcastillos‚Äù (castles), ‚Äútoritos‚Äù (little bulls), ‚Äúcanastillas‚Äù (little baskets) and Judas figures . Castillos are generally large wooden frames covered with brilliant flares, which can cost between 20,000 to 250,000 pesos depending on size and complexity. These are most often made to honor patron saints or Mexico‚Äôs patriot heroes. Toritos are smaller frames in the shape of a bull, designed to be worn or carried by a person as they are lit, chasing passers-by in the street during festivals. A version of the torito is designed to released candy when set off, which as the effect of having children run toward it, instead of running away. Toritos run about 800 pesos in the market. The most elaborate product is called a ‚Äúpiromusical‚Äù (pyro-musical) a set of fireworks synchronized to music and sometimes lights, with an average commercial price of about 10,000 pesos a minute, usually lasting about fourteen minutes. Tultepec Setting off cohetones or rockets during a religious festival in Colonia Doctores in Mexico City Most fireworks in Mexico are produced in the State of Mexico, especially the municipality of Tultepec just north of Mexico City, which has declared itself to be the ‚Äúpyrotechnics capital of Mexico.‚Äù This area has a two-hundred year tradition of making fireworks, with, about 65 percent of the population of the municipality is involved directly or indirectly in fireworks production. In Tultepec, all fireworks are made by hand, including decoration and wrapping, mostly in small factories or workshops that produce everything from small firecrackers to twelve-inch shells for professional shows. Tultepec is also one of the main suppliers of ingredients needed to make fireworks. Most fireworks production in the municipality is crowded into an area called the La Saucera pyrotechnic zone, located outside the town of Tultepec near the communities of Xahuento and Lomas. Originally, all of the fireworks production was scattered around the municipality, but after the explosion and fire of fireworks stands at the La Merced Market in Mexico City in 1988, authorities decided to force artisans into one area away from residential areas and with security precautions such as special warehouses for finished products and to store chemicals. The State of Mexico‚Äôs largest fireworks market is located here as well, called the Mercado de San Pablito, constructed by the state which spent nine million pesos to construct 300 study block stalls. However, this market suffered major explosions in 2005 and 2006, reducing most of the stalls to rubble on both occasions. The market also has problems with regulations on how much they can store and sell in the market, as well as the harassment of customers leaving the market by police. This has led to a fifty percent reduction in sales volume, with sales shifting to other, often clandestine, outlets in the municipality. The Feria Nacional de la Pirotecnia (National Pyrotechnics Festival) occurs each year in March in Tultepec, featuring a national competition of castillos. Most attendance for the event is for the piromusicales competition, which draws about 10,000 spectators. There are also competitions for toritos and castillos. Danger Fireworks exploding over church in Atotonilco de Tula Mexico The industry is a dangerous one, mostly due to lack of enforcement of existing safety laws and regulation and lack of professional training. A Tultepec mural shows townspeople, some lacking hands, lighting powder kegs and among castillos. In the State of Mexico alone, there are about 500 artisans who make fireworks illegally, without the proper training or facilities and without permission from authorities. According to the Instituto Mexiquense de la Pirotecnia, the main reason for this is that their manufacture is mostly done in families, rather than in factories. Most accidents have happened in Tultepec, with 46 explosions in the municipality in 2002 alone, with a total of twelve dead and dozens hurt. In 2011, there were fourteen explosions in La Saucera, none of which were fatal, and one in a clandestine shop that left four people dead. There have been a number of notable accidents related to the manufacture and sale of fireworks in Mexico. In 1998, an explosion in a workshop in the Barrio de San Agust√≠n neighborhood in Tultepec affected over one hundred houses and killed ten neighbors. In 1999, an explosion in Celaya left 56 dead and 350 hurt. In 2003, there was an explosion at the Miguel Hidalgo Market in Veracruz, which started at a clandestine fireworks warehouse that resulted in 28 dead, 35 hurt and 52 missing. In 2006, an explosion at the San Pablito market was attributed to a product called a ‚Äúcerillo‚Äù (match), which consists of a colored stick with chemicals on both ends which produces sparks when scraped on a surface. This led to a yearlong ban on the product so its safety could be reevaluated. The last major accident in Tultepec was in 2016 when a major fireworks explosion in San Pablito killed at least 32. Sales In Mexico, fireworks, especially large rockets called ‚Äúcohetones‚Äù are a staple of patron-saint festivals. Religious festivals even in the smallest towns have fireworks, which can include images of the patron saint on a frame outlined in pyrotechnics. This is particularly true to large pilgrimage sites such as that of Our Lady of San Juan de los Lagos. The biggest day for fireworks sales is Mexico‚Äôs independence day. For Mexico‚Äôs Bicentennial celebration at the Zocalo or main square in Mexico City, over 2,400 shells composed the multimedia spectacular which begins by a reenactment of Father Miguel Hidalgo‚Äôs call for troops at 11 pm September 15, 1810. There are three markets specializing in fireworks, San Pablito in Tultepec, one in Chimalhuac√°n and the other in Zumpango, with San Pablito being the most important in the country. National sales of fireworks fluctuates between 800,000 and 1,700,000 pesos per year. Only thirteen Mexican enterprises export abroad, mostly because they do not meet the standards for fireworks set by the United States, the closest major international market. Mexican fireworks tend to be more powerful than mass-produced Chinese ones, which account for most of legal sales in the United States, which tempts many Americans to try and bring them across the border for Fourth of July celebrations. Mexican fireworks are mostly promoted by the State of Mexico‚Äôs Instituto Mexiquense de Pirotecnia, which sponsors events such as art exhibits with a pyrotechnic theme and puppet shows on fireworks safety for children.

The term is a play on \\"cup-tied\\", which refers to a player who is not eligible to appear in a cup competition for a new team after having appeared for another team earlier in the season. There are several ways that a player can become 'cap-tied' to a national team. A player is 'cap-tied' once he has played in an official competition for the senior national team. A player can also be cap-tied once he has played in an official competition for a national team at any level providing that the player was not eligible to play for another national team at the time of his match appearance. For example, Adama Traor√©, an Ivorian youth international, had shown interest in playing for the Socceroos after having moved to Australia; however, in October 2013, the FFA released a statement saying that he was ineligible for Australia because of his prior appearances. In the event where a player is eligible to play for multiple nations, he is only 'cap-tied' to a nation after playing for its senior team in an official competition, or having played in an official competition at youth level and later submitting a request to change national association with FIFA. Playing in friendly competitions at any level does not cap-tie a player. A player who competes for one nation in a friendly match is not considered cap-tied and may represent another nation in a competitive fixture, should the opportunity present itself. An example of this is Jermaine Jones, who had played three friendlies for Germany in 2008 but started competing for the United States in 2010. In some instances, players have sought refuge in another country having represented their national team in an official competition. Players such as Maykel Galindo, Lester Mor√© and Osvaldo Alonso have represented the Cuba national football team and since defected to the United States but are now unable to represent another nation.

The novel follows a journalist named Miller and his appointment in the hostile town of Crossmaheart; it was well received by reviewers. A movie adaptation has been made, named Crossmaheart also, and was featured in a number of film festivals. Plot The mononymous Miller works for a Belfast newspaper named the Post, riding his bicycle nicknamed the \\"Cycle of Violence\\" from case to case. Shortly after the death of his father, he offends his boss Frank Galvin, duty editor, in a drunken outburst that leaves him curled up in the foetal position in the middle of his office. As a punishment, he is sent to the fictional town of Crossmaheart, home of the Posts sister paper, the Chronicle, as one of their reporters, Jamie Milburn, has gone missing. Miller arrives in the town and gets sexually involved with Marie Young, girlfriend of the missing Milburn. Marie suffered a sexual assault as a child and Miller, in an effort to help Marie deal with her persisting trauma, seeks out her attackers. Shortly after Miller speaks with each of the three parties; Reverend Michael Rainey, IRA member Tyrone Blair, and Tom Callaghan who is now blind and the only one of the three to show any remorse; they are each killed. Miller, now with a reputation as the \\"Angel of Death\\", attempts to solve the disappearance of Milburn while avoiding the police chasing him for these murders.

Development The title of the novel is intended to be a pun, referring to Miller's propensity to riding his bicycle when reporting on killings or court cases. Also, the fictional town of \\"Crossmaheart\\" in based on the South Armagh village of Crossmaglen, known for the numerous incidents which occurred in the area during The Troubles; the name being a play on words referring to the child's vow \\"cross my heart and hope to die\\". Movie The novel formed the basis for the 1998 British film Crossmaheart, directed by Henry Herbert, 17th Earl of Pembroke. The movie was shown as part of the Cannes Film Festival, the Dublin Film Festival and the Boston Irish Film Festival. Reception The novel was well received, with reviewers praising Batemans encapsulation of Northern Ireland during a particularly hostile time and the humour which runs throughout the book despite this. Jonathan Dyson, for The Independent, stated that \\"just as The Troubles seem finally to be ending, Colin Bateman is belatedly establishing himself as their greatest satirist\\"; and, of the book itself, \\"the resulting yarn is fast-paced, very black and very funny: Roddy Doyle meets Carl Hiaasen\\". Publishers Weekly called the novel \\"another side-splittingly funny, irreverent tale of violence\\", the finale of which they found to be \\"fascinating\\" and \\"devastating\\". They found \\"Bateman's forte is that, without directly addressing Northern Ireland's military / paramilitary confrontation, the book is drenched and reeking with the pervasive violence and fear of a war-torn state.\\" The review continues that the \\"horror\\" of the situation \\"is cleverly framed with the blinding sparkle of dark Northern Irish wit - humor so black that it will have readers chuckling even while it reveals the dreadful realities that laughter pretends to camouflage\\". In conclusion, they found that \\"we probably learn more about life in Northern Ireland from this brilliant, often hilarious novel than from a year of Sunday magazine specials\\". Kevin Cullen, for The Boston Globe, found that \\"Colin Bateman, who actually grew up and still lives in the place so many outsiders like to write about, has snatched the genre back with a vengeance, dreaming up scenarios that rely on the gallows humor peculiar to the natives of Northern Ireland\\"; stating also that \\"Only Bateman would look at the word \\"manslaughter\\" and see \\"man's laughter\\"\\". Cullen found that \\"Bateman's Vonnegut-like sense of absurdity is universal, and very funny\\" comparing the novel to Joseph Hellers Catch-22 in \\"serving up humor and pathos in equal proportions\\". He praised the fact that the \\"dialogue captures the perverse sense of humor that many people in Northern Ireland employ as a defense mechanism\\", stating in conclusion that \\"in Colin Bateman's world, the blind see and everybody dies. The reader, meanwhile, can't help but laugh\\". Kirkus Reviews were less effusive in their praise, finding Cycle of Violence to be \\"less manic - except for its luckless heroine - than Bateman's blackly comic debut, Divorcing Jack\\", finding that \\"Bateman and his hero both pay a high price for the few sweet, funny moments they wring out of this vale of tears\\".

He was the deputy chief engineer at the Siege of Louisbourg (1758) and the chief engineer at the siege of Quebec in 1759. In later years he was responsible for the design and construction of the town of Es Castell on the island of Menorca. Early life and career Patrick Mackellar was born in 1717, the son of John, the last Mackellar to be head tenant of Maam, Argyllshire. In 1735, probably through the influence of the Second Duke of Argyll he entered the Ordnance service, at that time very separate from the Army, as a clerk at Woolwich Arsenal. Four years later he was promoted to clerk of the works and posted to Menorca. His aptitude for engineering works was recognized on 7 December 1742Roll of Officers of the Corps of Royal Engineers from 1660 to 1898, ed. R. F. Edwards (Chatham, England, 1898). when he was granted a warrant as practitioner engineer, the lowest rank in the Corps of Engineers. In Menorca he worked on improving the defences of Port Mahon. These defences relied heavily on the great fortress of St Philip at the mouth of the harbour. On 8 March 1744 Mackellar was promoted to engineer extraordinary and on 31 July 1751 to engineer in ordinary; on 1 Dec 1745 he was also appointed an ensign in Wynyard's Regiment (4th Marines), presumably by purchase. Having returned to England, on 24 November 1754 he was designated by royal warrant as one of the engineers to accompany Major-General Edward Braddock to America.Maj-Gen W Porter, History of the Corps of Royal Engineers, Vol I, published by Institution of Royal Engineers, Chatham, 1889. Seven Years' War (French and Indian War) Mackellar first saw active service when he took part in the Braddock Expedition (along with the young George Washington) against Fort Duquesne (now Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania) in 1755. He was severely wounded in the Battle of the Monongahela on 9 July, when Braddock and 976 British and provincial soldiers out of the 1459 deployed were killed, but by the following spring he was at Fort Oswego as chief engineer of the frontier forts. During the summer Mackellar was engaged in repairing and strengthening the obsolete fortifications at Oswego, a difficult task as the original defences had been poorly sited and laid out. On 11 August a French force of 3000 men under the command of the Marquis de Montcalm appeared and the Battle of Fort Oswego (1756) ensued. The British surrendered during the afternoon of 14 August and Mackellar, having survived the subsequent massacre perpetrated by Montcalm's Indian allies, was taken to Quebec City where he was kept closely guarded. He was able, however, to make detailed notes on the city's defences and his report, bearing the initials \\"PM\\" and of which several copies still exist, is dated September 1756. At some time in September he was transferred to Montreal and after some months as a prisoner-of-war, Mackellar was exchanged. He returned to Britain early in 1757 and on 14 May, when all military engineers were finally given army rank, he was commissioned a captain in the Corps of Engineers. In December 1757, following a meeting with a fellow ex-prisoner-of-war named Moss, it would appear that Mackellar had time to draw upon his notes in order to compile a postscript to his report, which was dated and initialled 23 December 1757, and to arrange the production of a map. It was undoubtedly his recent experiences in New France and the important intelligence contained in his report that prompted his next appointment. On 4 January 1758 year Mackellar was promoted to major and sub-director of engineers and was appointed deputy to Colonel John Henry Bastide in the expedition against Louisbourg, the key to control of the St Lawrence, the vital supply line of Canada. The British forces disembarked in Gabarus bay, a couple of miles from their objective, on 8 June 1758 and commenced the Siege of Louisbourg (1758). Mackellar initially accompanied the then Brigadier- General James Wolfe on his rapid, left-flanking thrust to encircle the town and to place batteries at the entrance to the harbour on the opposite shore to the town. On 8 July, when Bastide was wounded, Mackellar became the acting chief engineer. Although Wolfe was impatient with the slow progress of the siege (and let his unflattering opinion of military engineers be generally known), it appears that not a little of the credit for the capitulation of Louisbourg on 27 July was due to Mackellar's professional skill. It was not therefore surprising that a few months later Mackellar was selected to serve as chief engineer in the expedition that Wolfe was to command against Quebec. In May 1759 the army of 8,500 men assembled at Louisbourg and then sailed up the St Lawrence to Quebec. During the siege of Quebec the information contained in Mackellar's report proved to be invaluable. Although much of it was out of date, it nonetheless provided Wolfe with the only substantial body of intelligence about his objective, and Mackellar became one of Wolfe's few trusted advisers. Despite being wounded in an earlier attack on 31 July near the Montmorency River, Mackellar sited the British batteries and conducted all preliminary siege operations against Quebec. He also devised and tested methods of landing infantry from floating stages. He advised Wolfe against a frontal attack upon the city and accompanied the general on his final reconnaissance. Mackellar was with Wolfe during the famous scaling of the cliffs on the night of 12/13 September and, immediately after the victory at the Battle of the Plains of Abraham, he prepared to extend the siege operations against the newly exposed walls of the upper city, but the capitulation of Quebec five days later made these efforts unnecessary. During the autumn of 1759 and the spring of 1760 he strengthened the defences of the city against an expected French counterattack, and had the direction of the artillery in the force under Brigadier-General James Murray at the Battle of Sainte-Foy on 28 April. Although critically wounded in the battle and subsequent withdrawal through Sillery to Quebec, Mackellar supervised the defence of the city during his convalescence and up until the arrival of a British squadron in May forced the French to raise the siege. He later took part in the capture of Montreal and other engagements, thus completing the defeat of the French in Canada. In November 1760 Mackellar was appointed chief engineer at Halifax, Nova Scotia, where he initiated important works to improve the defences and devoted much time and energy to training troops for siege operations. On 7 January 1762 he arrived in Martinique as chief engineer with General Monckton‚Äôs expedition to that island. By 4 February, after a difficult siege, Fort Royal was captured and the whole island surrendered soon after. Monkton‚Äôs force was then reinforced by further troops from England for an attack on Havana for which Mackellar was again appointed chief engineer. On 7 June the troops landed in Cuba and began the campaign by besieging the fort called El Morro that was strategically sited at the harbour entrance opposite the city of Havana. In desperately hot conditions and ravaged by disease, the British forces made slow progress, but on 30 July two mines were exploded, caving in the huge ditch protecting the landward side of El Morro. The breach was stormed, the fort captured and the rest of the island surrendered soon after. It was Mackellar‚Äôs journal that formed the basis of the report of the capture of Havana in the London Gazette of 7 September 1762. Mackellar, however, was dangerously wounded during the siege of Morro Castle and never completely recovered. Later life and death After the Treaty of Paris in 1763 Mackellar was posted back to Menorca, where he again worked on improving the defences. He was promoted brevet lieutenant-colonel on 3 January 1762, lieutenant-colonel on 2 February 1775, and director of engineers and colonel on 29 August 1777. Probably at some time while in Menorca he married Elizabeth Basaline and had two sons. His elder son John was born in Menorca in 1768. He rose to the rank of admiral of the blue, despite being court-martialed and dismissed the service in 1802, and served in Halifax from 1804 to 1810 as agent for prisoners of war and transports and as governor of the naval hospital. Patrick's descendants include Major-General Townshend, the \\"hero of Kut-al-Amara\\", and Steven Fletcher who was a first quadriplegic Canadian member of parliament(2004-2015), member of the federal cabinet and the queens privy council (2008).Linda Mackintosh, What do you do if you don't die?, HeartlandLinda Mackintosh, Master of my fate, Heartland From 1763 until his death on 22 October 1778 Mackellar was engaged in rebuilding and fortifying the harbour at Mahon. One of the main reasons for the relatively rapid fall of Fort St Philip in 1756 had been the proximity of Philip's Town to the fortifications. This settlement had sprung up around the fortress in response to the lack of quartering for soldiers within the fort itself and in the inevitable way that taverns, sutlers, families and less reputable women coalesced around the armies of that time. When the French began their siege operations they were able to use the town to conceal their approach from the fire of the fort and to provide ready material for the building of their batteries. Following the destruction of Philip's Town, Mackellar designed and supervised the building of a new military town at a distance of about a mile from the fort, which town is now called Es Castell. The town is laid out in a grid pattern with a magnificent parade ground in the centre that is now the town square. In 2002, the bicentenary of the return of Menorca from Britain to Spain, a plaque was erected in his memory in the main street of Es Castell. Mackellar left interesting and valuable accounts of the principal operations in which he was involved including ‚ÄúPlan of the town of Quebec the capital of Canada . . . showing the principal encampments and works of the British army commanded by Major General Wolfe and those of the French army commanded by Lieut. General the Marquis of Montcalm‚Äù. \\"A sketch of the field of Battle of July 9th upon the Monongahela seven miles from Fort Du Quesne, showing the Disposition of the Troops when the Action began\\" is considered the best map detailing events during Braddock's defeat.

It was first published in the collection Lyrical Ballads in 1798. It is written in anapestic tetrameter. The poem records the memories awakening in a country girl in London on hearing a thrush sing in the early morning.  Text  At the corner of Wood-Street, when day-light appears, There's a Thrush that sings loud, it has sung for three years. Poor Susan has pass'd by the spot and has heard In the silence of morning the song of the bird. 'Tis a note of enchantment; what ails her? She sees A mountain ascending, a vision of trees; Bright volumes of vapour through Lothbury glide, And a river flows on through the vale of Cheapside. Green pastures she views in the midst of the dale, Down which she so often has tripp'd with her pail, And a single small cottage, a nest like a dove's, The only one dwelling on earth that she loves. She looks, and her heart is in Heaven, but they fade, The mist and the river, the hill and the shade; The stream will not flow, and the hill will not rise, And the colours have all pass'd away from her eyes. Poor Outcast! return‚Äîto receive thee once more The house of thy Father will open its door, And thou once again, in thy plain russet gown, Mayst hear the thrush sing from a tree of its own.

It is one of the largest medical schools in the UK, and in 1903 became one of the first to be incorporated into a university. The school used to have a problem-based learning curriculum, which was replaced in 2014 with a new 'integrated' curriculum for its flagship five-year MBChB course, which has an annual intake of 280 students. Around 1400 medical undergraduates and 600 taught postgraduates study at the school at any one time. The school also offers an MD programme and courses for continuing professional development.  History  A medical school in Liverpool was established in 1834. Dr Richard Formby, who ran a course of lectures in anatomy and physiology since 1818, joined with a group of colleagues to form a school of medicine attached to the Liverpool Royal Institution, which occupied rooms in Colquitt Street. William Gill (surgeon), who had set up a second Anatomy School in Liverpool in 1827, accepted a joint Lectureship in Anatomy with Dr Formby, who also lectured in Medicine. Other doctors from the Infirmary and Dispensary lectured on Surgery, Chemistry, Midwifery and Medical jurisprudence. In 1844, the medical school became attached to the Liverpool Infirmary, which was renamed in 1851 to become the Liverpool Royal Infirmary School of Medicine. In November 1877, a joint meeting was held between the Liverpool Association for the Promotion of Higher Education and the Council of the School of Medicine to look to establishing a University in Liverpool. Several staff members of the medical school were mentioned at the meeting including Dr Richard Caton, William Mitchell Banks and Reginald Harrison. That same year, Experimental physics was included in the syllabus for University of London medical degrees, which Liverpool could not provide. Thus, University College Liverpool was eventually established in 1881. The Royal Infirmary School of Medicine initially kept its independence, but in 1884 became the Faculty of Medicine when University College was affiliated to Victoria University, along with Owen's College, Manchester and Yorkshire College, Leeds. Victoria University had the power to award medical degrees with its own syllabus requirements. The University of Liverpool received its royal charter in 1903, establishing its independence and leading the way for many provincial medical schools. This also made it possible for degrees to be awarded to women. The associated Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine was the first school of Tropical Medicine in the world. In 2011 following an internal restructure of the University, the Faculty of Medicine was demoted back to School status under the stewardship of the new Faculty of Health and Life Sciences.  Facilities  The school's facilities have recently undergone a massive refurbishment and redevelopment. The refurbished Liverpool Royal Infirmary Waterhouse buildings house the Clinical Skills Resource Centre for clinical teaching, and a centre for the development of personalised medicine. The school also makes use of a Human Anatomy Resource Centre for anatomy teaching. The School of Medicine is based in the 19th century Cedar House building on Ashton Street. Cedar House includes teaching rooms, administrative offices for the senior management, and a medical student common room.  Teaching hospitals  The medical school has close links with the region's NHS organisations, which are actively involved in designing its courses and in hosting students for the practical aspects of training. Hospitals include: Royal Liverpool University Hospital, Broadgreen Hospital, Whiston Hospital, Aintree University Hospital, The Walton Centre for Neurology and Neurosurgery, Arrowe Park Hospital, Liverpool Women's Hospital, Countess of Chester Hospital, Warrington Hospital and Alder Hey Children's Hospital. The medical school also has close links with the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine. Courses The School provides undergraduate and postgraduate courses in medicine. In 2011 there were around 1,400 undergraduate students enrolled on the MBChB course and 600 taught postgraduates For the five-year A100 course, the current conditional offer given to a student taking A-Level examinations is AAA, to include Biology and Chemistry at A-Level. Candidates are required to sit the UCAT examination. The style of interviews is MMI (Multiple Mini Interviews). As with all UK Medical Students, successful applicants must be immunised against Hepatitis B, Diphtheria, Polio, Rubella, Tetanus, Varicella and Tuberculosis.

Beskid Dukielski forms the middle of the Low Beskids in the Western Carpathian Mountains. Piotru≈õ is the highest mountain of the Beskid Dukielski. A tourist trail passes through the mountain. Its most prominent characteristic is a stream and pond related to the Saint John of Dukla.  Geology  The Beskid Dukielski Range is located within the outer part of the Carpathians, which is part of the Alpine orogenic belt. The Outer Carpathians fold and thrust belt, is subdivided into several nappes bounded by thrust faults. The mountain lies within the Dukla Nappe which is further faulted into smaller thrust sheets. The sequence that outcrops in this area consists of flysch type sedimentary rocks of Upper Cretaceous to Paleogene in age. Piotru≈õ itself is formed of Oligocene age rocks, particularly the Menilite Beds, which contain the Mszanka Sandstones, the Jawornik Marls the Cergowa Sandstones or Shales with interbedded layers of Tylawa Limestone. Prominent ridges near the top of the mountain consist of thick-bedded layers of sandstone and conglomerate that form part of the Mszanka Sandstones. Physical characteristics The tallest mountain in the Beskid Dukielski, Piotru≈õ is relatively flat-structured, giving it its alternative name of P≈Çazyna. The mountain is crescent-shaped, aligned roughly north-south. It is bounded to the west and south by the valley of the Jasio≈Çka river, separating it from Ostra Mountain to the south. The mountain is covered in forest, primarily old beech trees, and near the top, in birch, European mountain-ash and alder. A spruce forest on Piotru≈õ's western slope was mostly destroyed in a fire during the interwar period. A yellow sandstone rock is prominently displayed at the top of the mountain, which likely contributed to its name (Piotr ‚Äì Polish for Peter ‚Äì also means stone). Some of it was excavated for buildings, and several unused large blocks can be found. The mountain is the source for numerous streams, which form small ponds the largest of which is known as the Murowana Studnia'. Another pond (Holy Water, Polish: ≈öwiƒôta Woda) is linked to the legend of Saint John of Dukla, who is said to have rested there. There is also a \\"Papal stone\\" (\\"Kamie≈Ñ papieski), commemorating the presence of Karol Wojty≈Ça here. A small chapel was raised in the site in 2005.

The origin of the name Avenor is not known.  Location  Their traditional area is located in the south eastern part of the Volta Region of Ghana. The Avenor traditional area has Avenorpeme as it traditional seat and Akatsi as the administrative capital. Administratively, the people of Avenor can be found in two districts namely the Akatsi South District which is Avenorland and Akatsi North District which the Avenors share with their neighbours to the north, the Aves. The traditional area is bordered to the south by the Anlo Ewe (Keta Municipal District) on the east by the Somes (Ketu District), the west by the Tongus and Agaves (North and South Tongus districts) and North by the Aves (Akatsi North district).  History  Tradition has it that the Avenor people lived in a town by the name Avenor Ketukpe, a suburb of Ketu in the lower Niger area, the original home of all Ewe- speaking people. The Avenor like other Ewe groups moved from Avenor Ketukpe to Notsie due to incessant conflicts with their enemies (mostly like the Yorubas) The headman or leader of the Avenors at Ketukpe was Togbe Agbohlo whose son Anumah led the Avenors to Notsie. On leaving Notsie, the Avenors under their leader Anumah, moved very closely with the Agus, with whom they found their first settlement at Avenor-Agu Volui near present Kpalime in the Republic of Togo. Their next settlement was at Anyirawase Awudome. Tribal frictions made them move to Fodzoku from where they later crossed the Volta to Kroboland, founding a settlement at Kpong. They became known as Avenor Krobos. This is still sung in songs and the Avenors still have descendants in Kroboland. Frequent clashes with the Akwamus made the Avenors to leave to continue their wandering. From Kroboland there was a general dispersion. One group defected to found a settlement by the Gas at a place now called Avenor close to the Police Training Depot in Accra. The larger group led by Togbui Anumah made settlement at Tefle Avenorkpo in Fieve land. Avenorkpo still stands. The group that sojourned in Accra had to flee from Accra to look for the larger group at a time when Ofori, the King of Accra and his people also fled from the Akwamus to LittlePopo (about 1682). Quarrel over farmland and fishing zones with the Tefles made the Avenors to cross the Volta to found a settlement at Yorta, later called Detsowome, near Dabala. At Yorta, male child without one arm and an eye was born to one Ku of the chiefly (royal) family. The incident was an ill omen. Then there arose the saying \\"Detsagbawor\\" a typical Avenor word meaning, what strange thing has befallen us. Detsagbawor is now Detsawame. By then the Accra group had caught up with the group led by Anumah. Trekking resumed and the Avenors found a new home at Adume near present Avenorpedo (Avenor‚Äôs deserted home). Here Togbui Anumah went to farm to be succeeded by his son Atsu Fiadzea. Anumah‚Äôs grave has been marked by an uncultivated grove, now still standing at Adume- Avenorpedo. The Tefles had not forgiven the Avenor encounters they had at Teflekpo and took to kidnapping Avenor women when the opportunity occurred. At Adume the nearest source of water was at Lotor, a distance of four miles away. Whenever Avenor women went to fetch water the Tefles would lay ambush to them and either kill or kidnap them, so the place become known as Lotor- Latsi meaning \\"you will come but not return\\". This situation forced the Avenors under their leader Atsu Fiadzea to move away to a place called Korvenu (the grove that protects). At Korvenu the Avenors in alliance with the Adas fought the Anlo in 1750 and 1767. In 1775, the Avenors again fought the Anlos in what is called the Korvenu War or Anyamakpa war. The scene of war is called Ametawito meaning the \\"pit of skull\\". The Avenors had to abandon their settlement to found a new home at Agbiveme also Afeyeme (new abode). Here Atsu Fiadzea died and was succeeded by his son Adoe under whom the Avenors made their permanent home at Avenorpeme about 1776. From the settlement at Avenorpeme, new settlements were founded by hunters and adventurers emanating from the thirteen clans of Avenor.

The focus of his scientific work was on excavations of megalithic tombs, the grave sites of the Neolithic farming peoples around the middle of the 3rd century B.C. and on the excavations of Slavic archaeological sites (600 to 1,200 A.D.). Excavations from this time gave him insights into the social, economic and cultural life of the ancient Slavs. By 1945 almost nothing was known about them in Mecklenburg; his achievement is that our knowledge of this field increased many times over.Rolf Seiffert: Der Mann, der Mecklenburg ausgrub: Prof. Dr. Ewald Schuldt (3.

Definition The concept of the matrifocal family was introduced to the study of Caribbean societies by Raymond Smith in 1956. He linked the emergence of matrifocal families with how households are formed in the region: \\"The household group tends to be matri-focal in the sense that a woman in the status of 'mother' is usually the de facto leader of the group, and conversely the husband-father, although de jure head of the household group (if present), is usually marginal to the complex of internal relationships of the group. By 'marginal' we mean that he associates relatively infrequently with the other members of the group, and is on the fringe of the effective ties which bind the group together\\". Smith emphasises that a matrifocal family is not simply woman-centred, but rather mother-centred; women in their role as mothers become key to organising the family group; men tend to be marginal to this organisation and to the household (though they may have a more central role in other networks). Where matrifocal families are common, marriage is less common. In later work, Smith tends to emphasise the household less, and to see matrifocality more in terms of how the family network forms with mothers as key nodes in the network. Throughout, Smith argues that matrifocal kinship should be seen as a subsystem in a larger stratified society and its cultural values. He increasingly emphasises how the Afro-Caribbean matrifocal family is best understood within of a class-race hierarchy where marriage is connected to perceived status and prestige. \\"A family or domestic group is matrifocal when it is centred on a woman and her children. In this case the father(s) of these children are intermittently present in the life of the group and occupy a secondary place. The children's mother is not necessarily the wife of one of the children's fathers.\\" (Glossary, entry matrifocal) In general, according to Laura Hobson Herlihy citing P. Mohammed, women have \\"high status\\" if they are \\"the main wage earners\\", they \\"control ... the household economy\\", and males tend to be absent.Three quotations: , cited in Men's absences are often of long durations. One of R. T. Smith's contemporary critics, M. G. Smith, notes that while households may appear matrifocal taken by themselves, the linkages between households may be patrifocal. That is, a man in his role as father may be providing (particularly economic) support to a mother in one or more households whether he lives in that household or not. Both for men and for women having children with more than one partner is a common feature of this kind of system. Alternative terms for 'matrifocal' or 'matrifocality' include matricentric, matripotestal, and women-centered kinship networks. The matrifocal is distinguished from the matrilocal, the matrilineal, matrilateral and matriarchy (the last because matrifocality does not imply that women have power in the larger community). Characteristics and distribution According to anthropologist Maurice Godelier, matrifocality is \\"typical of Afro- Caribbean groups\\" and some African-American communities. These include families in which a father has a wife and one or more mistresses; in a few cases, a mother may have more than one lover. Matrifocality was also found, according to Rasmussen per Herlihy, among the Tuareg people in northern Africa;, cited in according to Herlihy citing other authors, in some Mediterranean communities; and, according to Herlihy quoting Scott, in urban Brazil., cited in In their study of family life in Bethnal Green, London, during the 1950s, Young and Wilmott found both matrifocal and matrilineal elements at work: mothers were a focus for distributing economic resources through the family network; they were also active in passing down the rights to tenancies in matrilineal succession to their daughters. Herlihy found matrifocality among the Miskitu people, in the village of Kuri, on the Caribbean coast of northeastern Honduras in the late 1990s. According to Herlihy, the \\"main power\\" of Kuri women lies \\"in their ability to craft everyday social identities and kinship relations .... Their power lies beyond the scope of the Honduran state, which recognizes male surnames and males as legitimate heads of households.\\" Herlihy found in Kuri a trend toward matriliny and a correlation with matrilineality,. while some patriarchal norms also existed. Herlihy found that the \\"women knew more than most men about village histories, genealogies, and local folklore\\" and that \\"men typically did not know local kinship relations, the proper terms of reference, or reciprocity obligations in their wife's family\\" and concluded that Miskitu women \\"increasingly assume responsibility for the social reproduction of identities and ultimately for preserving worldwide cultural and linguistic diversity\\". The Nair community in Kerala and the Bunt community in Tulunadu in South India are prime examples of matrifocality. This can be attributed to the fact that if males were largely warriors by profession, a community was bound to lose male members at youth, leading to a situation where the females assumed the role of running the family.. History In the 14th century, in Jiangnan, South China, under Mongol rule by the Yuan dynasty, Kong Qi kept a diary of his view of some families as practicing gynarchy, not defined as it is in major dictionariesThe New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary. Oxford: Oxford Univ. Press, [4th] ed. 1993, .Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language Unabridged. G. & C. Merriam (Merriam- Webster), 1966.The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language. Boston, Mass.: Houghton Mifflin, 3d ed. 1992, .Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary. New York: Random House, 2d ed. 2001, . but defined by Paul J. Smith as \\"the creation of short-term family structures dominated by women\\" and see pp. 1 (abstract), 2‚Äì3, 46, 63, 65, 69‚Äì70, 72‚Äì73 & 81 and not as matrilineal or matriarchal. The gynarchy possibly could be passed down through generations. According to Paul J. Smith, it was to this kind of gynarchy that \\"Kong ascribed...the general collapse of society\\" and Kong believed that men in Jiangnan tended to \\"forfeit...authority to women\\". Matrifocality arose, Godelier said, in some Afro-Caribbean and African American cultures as a consequence of enslavement of thousands. Slaves were forbidden to marry and their children belonged to the slavemasters. Women in slave families \\"often\\" sought impregnation by White masters so the children would have lighter skin color and be more successful in life, lessening the role of Black husbands. Some societies, particularly Western European, allow women to enter the paid labor force or receive government aid and thus be able to afford to raise children alone, while some other societies \\"oppose ... [women] living on their own.\\" In feminist belief (more common in the 1970s than in the 1990s‚Äì2000s, and criticized within feminism and within archaeology, anthropology and theology as lacking a scholarly basis), there was a \\"matrifocal (if not matriarchal) Golden Age\\" before patriarchy.

It was located at Ikizu, 65 kilometers southeast of Musoma town. In 1975, the Tanzania Union Mission combined the Adventist School of Health Evangelism (ASHE) at Heri Hospital in Kigoma and the ministerial course at Ikizu. This consolidated institution was then transferred to a new site at Usa River, 24 kilometers from Arusha town, and was named Arusha Adventist Seminary (AAS). In 1978, AAS was upgraded to a college status and named Tanzania Adventist Seminary and College (TASC). In 1992, the name was changed to Tanzania Adventist College (TAC) and the ministerial course was replaced by a two-year diploma program in theology. In 1996, TAC was affiliated to Griggs University in the USA. Under this affiliation, TAC offered BA in Theology and Religion. In 1998, the affiliation shifted from Griggs University to the University of Eastern Africa, Baraton (UEAB) in Kenya. Under this affiliation, TAC offered BA in theology and reli- gion, BBA in accounting and management and diploma courses in education and business. Apart from the affiliation with UEAB, TAC was also a teachers‚Äò college under the then Ministry of Education and Culture (MEC). Under the MEC Registration Number S. 401, it offered diploma in education, diploma in secretarial science, and certificate in secretarial science. In early 2003, TAC began the process of being a University. In September 2003, it was granted a Letter of Interim Authority (LIA) by the then Higher Education Accreditation Council (HEAC) of Tanzania, now called the Tanzania Commission for Universities (TCU). Under the LIA, TAC was authorized to carry the name the University of Arusha. In September 2004, HEAC granted the University of Arusha (UoA) a certificate of Provisional Registration No. 016. In the year 2006, the University of Arusha became fully licensed and accredited by Tanzania Commission for Universities as a graduate university. In 2009, the University of Arusha submitted the first four graduate programs to the TCU for accreditation in education and business. The Graduate School with its programs in business and education started in November 2010 in Arusha City. Under the School of Education, the following concentrations are offered: (a) MA in educational management and (b) MA in curriculum and instruction. The Faculty of Business also offers three areas of concentration and they are as follows: (a) MBA in finance and accounting, (b) MBA in strategic marketing and entrepreneurship, and (c) MBA in strategic human resource.

Life Blasich graduated in medicine and participated in the political stream alongside Riccardo Zanella, leader of the Autonomist Fiumo Party or Independent Party (as it was known to everyone in the city of Rijeka. In 1914, upon the outbreak of the First World War, Blasich was inducted into the Austro-Hungarian army alongside Zanella, and was sent to the Eastern Front. There he surrendered to the enemy, claiming to be an Italian irredentist and asked to be sent to Italy to join the Italian army. His request was granted and upon arrival in Italy, he was enlisted with the rank of Captain Doctor, fighting for the duration of the war on the front line. The Hungarian government however for his initial surrenderment, condemned him to death for desertion.Salvatore Samani, Biographical Dictionary of Rijeka, Dolo-Venice 1975, Institute Tipografico Editorial, p. 38 sg. At the end of the war in 1919, Blasich continued to work closely with Zanella and the independent party. Initially he approved the companionship of Gabriele d'Annunzio, however he later politically opposed the poet. After the Treaty of Rapallo on 12 November 1920, which established the Free State of Fiume in Rijeka, Blasich became the deputy to the Constituent Assembly and the Minister of the Interior of the Zanella Government, formed in October of that year.Hamlet Ballarini, The antidannunzio in Rijeka. Riccardo Zanella, Trieste 1995, published by Italo Svevo. On 3 March 1922 the Government of the Free State of Fiume was overthrown by a coup d'etat lasting 18 months by Italian fascists and ex-legionnaires with the active participation of 2000 armed Trieste Fascists (Trieste earlier being annexed by Italy in 1920) led by Francesco Giunta. Zenalla and Blasich as a result were forced to flee to Yugoslavia. After the annexation of Fiume to Italy and the Treaty of Rome, 27 January 1924, almost all members of the Constituent Assembly in exile (except Zanella) returned to the city, and Blasich resumed his medical profession.Hamlet Ballarini, The antidannunzio in Rijeka.

In 2007, alongside John Zimmer, Green founded Zimride, a ride-sharing platform that coordinated carpools, especially across college campuses. Career=Inspiration Green grew up in Los Angeles where he \\"spent most of [his] life stuck in traffic\\".Bell, Josh. Two Startups Harness Facebook's Power to Connect Riders to Rides. ABC News. September 4, 2007. Interested in solving transportation flaws, Green forced himself to travel around California without an automobile. While attending college in Santa Barbara, he used public transportation options like Greyhound and Amtrak to visit his girlfriend in Los Angeles. He also used Craigslist's ride boards for carpooling, but always felt anxiety about not knowing the passenger or driver. After realizing the limits of public transportation, Green started a car-sharing program and asked Zipcar to place cars at UCSB. Because the company only had 100 cars at the time and was based on the East Coast, it couldn't provide any vehicles. Instead, Green acquired several Toyota Prius cars and other vehicles and began a car-sharing program that let users unlock cars with radio-frequency identification. The program had over 2,000 people on campus sharing four cars. During college, Green also served on the Santa Barbara Metropolitan Transit District (MTD) board. During his time on the board, Green realized that large scale changes to public opinion were needed in order to improve public transportation.  Zimride (2006‚Äì2013)  In 2006, Green was inspired by a post-college trip to Zimbabwe in which he saw locals using crowdsourced carpool networks for transportation. Using the Facebook API, he developed a platform that allowed users to find and plan carpools. He named his app Zimride in honor of Zimbabwe's carpooling network. Of the early versions of Zimride, Green said, \\"Public transportation is broken. We're trying to create the next form that works\\".Garthwaite, Josie.

Green and Zimmer promoted the service through guerrilla marketing campaigns; in particular, the pair would dress in frog suits and hand out flyers to students on the Cornell campus. Green and Zimmer moved to Silicon Valley to work on growing the company, where they shared an apartment that also doubled as their office. The two did not take a salary for three years. In 2012, Green and Zimmer shifted the company's focus to their bigger mission of providing an alternative to car ownership. That year, the company launched a smartphone app that allowed users to request rides more frequently and for shorter commutes rather than long-distance trips as Zimride had previously done. In May 2013, the company reincorporated as Lyft and sold Zimride to Enterprise Holdings.  Lyft (2013‚Äìpresent)  , Green and Zimmer have raised $4.1 billion dollars for Lyft, valuing the company at $11.5 billion.

As a result, the Russian Baptist Union, one of the main participants in OSROG, decided in December 1921 that continued involvement was no longer in its interests. It is not certain exactly when OSROG stopped operating altogether: suggested dates vary between 1922 and 1928, with 1923 being the most likely.

Role in mythology  After his wife Chang'e consumed the elixir of immortality, Houyi realized that he would never again be immortal and would soon die. He resolved to pass his knowledge and skills of archery and hunting to the next generation to ensure that they would live after his death. In order to do so, he decided to take an apprentice, Feng Meng; this apprentice soon became an expert archer but even so he was still envious of Houyi's superior abilities, especially after a fateful archery competition in which Houyi killed as many geese as Feng Meng did with his archery despite having a far more difficult target. Feng Meng made multiple attempts on his old master's life; tried to ambush him with his bow and arrow only for Houyi to stop his arrows with a return volley. Finally, Feng Meng resorted to the use of a stick made from a peach tree to bludgeon his master to death. Other stories are told of Feng Meng, set in times previous to or after this fateful event. In one telling, told during the Chinese 'Mooncake Festival' or Mid- Autumn Festival, Feng Meng (rendered in this translation as Peng Meng), was the cause of Chang'e's fateful decision to consume the elixir of immortality herself instead of sharing it with him.

Based on the political, social, and economic background of one's direct ancestors as well as the behavior of their relatives, songbun is used to determine whether an individual is trusted with responsibilities, is given opportunities within North Korea, or even receives adequate food. Songbun affects access to educational and employment opportunities and it particularly determines whether a person is eligible to join North Korea's ruling party, the Workers' Party of Korea. History The Korean Workers' Party Politburo passed a decree in 1957 entitled \\"On the Transformation of the Struggle with Counterrevolutionary Elements into an All-People All-Party Movement\\", which established the policy and programs for conducting its first large-scale purges of North Korean society.Andrei Lankov, \\"The Repressive System And The Political Control In North Korea,\\" in Severnaia Koreia: vchera i segodnia (North Korea: Yesterday and Today) (Moscow: Vostochnaia literatura, 1995) The May 30th Resolution and the KWP's Intensive Guidance Project provided the basis for songbun's socio-political classification of the entire North Korean population by dividing the entire citizenry into three distinct loyalty groups based on family background: \\"friendly\\", \\"neutral\\", and \\"enemy\\" forces.Kim Yong-gu, \\"North Korean Residents' Songbun,\\" 70‚Äì75; and Andrei Lankov, \\"The Repressive System And The Political Control In North Korea\\" Description There are three main classifications and about 50 sub-classifications. According to Kim Il-sung, who spoke in 1958, the loyal \\"core class\\" constituted 25% of the North Korean population, the \\"wavering class\\" constituted 55%, and the \\"hostile class\\" constituted 20%. Those with a landlord, merchant, lawyer, or Christian minister in their background are given very low status. The highest status is accorded to those descended from participants in the resistance against Japanese occupation during and before World War II and to those who were factory workers, laborers or peasants as of 1950. B. R. Myers, associate professor of international studies at Dongseo University in Busan, South Korea, summarizes the core class as consisting of \\"high-ranking party cadres and their families\\". The wavering class is reserved for average North Koreans, whereas the \\"hostile\\" class is made of possible subversive elements (e.g. former landowners). According to CIA analyst Helen- Louise Hunter, the Communists were highly successful in turning the pre- revolutionary social structure upside down, and songbun is reflective of that. In her view, the \\"preferred class\\" consists of 30% of the population, the \\"ordinary people\\" make up the middle 40%, and \\"undesirables\\" make up the bottom 30%.Helen-Louise Hunter, Kim Il-song's North Korea, Praeger, Westport, CT, 1999, pp. 4‚Äì5. Files are maintained on every North Korean by security official and party cadres from age 17 and updated every two years. In general, songbun is difficult to improve, but it can be downgraded for a variety of reasons such as a lack of political enthusiasm, marrying someone of lower standing, or being convicted‚Äîor having a family member convicted‚Äîof a crime, political or otherwise. Before the late 1960s, it was possible to conceal that a relative had bad songbun; however, the ancestry of all citizens was thoroughly checked starting with a 1966 census. These investigations have been suggested to have been a response to the Chinese Cultural Revolution which began in 1966. Kim Il-sung, afraid that Beijing would also interfere in his country, whether by invading or sponsoring a coup d'√©tat (Chinese soldiers had been sent previously on \\"provocative incursions\\" into Korea), aimed to increase internal security by classifying his citizens. These investigations were repeated several times in subsequent years, for reasons varying from suspected corruption in previous checks to weeding out possible opposition. U.S. journalist Barbara Demick describes this \\"class structure\\" as an updating of the hereditary \\"caste system\\", combining Confucianism and Stalinism.Barbara Demick, Nothing to Envy: Love, Life and Death in North Korea, Fourth Estate, London, 2010, pp. 26‚Äì27. She claims that a bad family background is called \\"tainted blood\\", and that by law this \\"tainted blood\\" lasts for three generations.Demick, pp. 28, 197, 202. She asserts, however, that North Koreans are not told of their classification, and that children can grow up without knowing about their family status.Demick, p. 28. Similarly, analyst Helen- Louise Hunter describes songbun as \\"class background\\" and says that it is not officially published or precisely defined.Helen-Louise Hunter, Kim Il-song's North Korea, Praeger, Westport, CT, 1999, pp. 3, 6. The North Korean government, on the contrary, proclaims that all citizens are equal and denies any discrimination on the basis of family background.KINU White Paper on Human Rights in North Korea 2011, pp. 216, 225 Importance Since the collapse of the Eastern Bloc in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the importance of songbun has decreased. Before the collapse, the North Korean economy was heavily subsidized by the bloc. Through these funds, the government was able to provide all material goods, so income could only be derived by working in industry or the bureaucracy. As a result, one's ability to obtain goods from the distribution system, where one could live, what career was pursued, or how much one could advance in society depended solely on their songbun, which made it the \\"single-most important factor that determined the life of a North Korean\\". Before the centralized system's collapse‚Äîwhich led to famine‚Äîthe government had \\"near-complete control of an individual's life\\"; ergo, the only way to increase one's status or affluence was by advancing through the bureaucracy. During the 1994 to 1998 North Korean famine itself‚Äîwhen up to 2.5 million died‚Äîthe songbun system \\"often determined who ate and who starved\\", according to Brian Hook. As the centralized system collapsed, the importance of songbun decreased. To survive, capitalism was \\"rediscovered\\", and the average North Korean now derives most of his or her income through private enterprise. When these private markets started, it was instead more advantageous to be part of the hostile class, because they were not as dependent on the government as were those with better songbun. Military service has decreased in popularity; previously, after seven to ten years of service, a North Korean man could hope to become a low-level bureaucrat, but nowadays it is more profitable to engage in private enterprise. Songbun remains important to members of the government elite, but for the majority of North Koreans, wealth has become more important than songbun when defining one's place in society. A prominent example of songbun involves Ko Yong-hui, the mother of present leader Kim Jong-un. Ko was born in Osaka, Japan, which would make her part of the hostile class because of her Korean-Japanese heritage; furthermore, her grandfather worked in a sewing factory for the Imperial Japanese Army. Before an internal propaganda film was released, after the ascension of Kim Jong-un, there were three attempts made to idolize Ko, in a style similar to that associated with Kang Pan-s≈èk, mother of Kim Il-sung, and Kim Jong-suk, mother of Kim Jong-il and the first wife of Kim Il-sung. These previous attempts at idolization had failed, and they were stopped after Kim Jong-il's 2008 stroke. The building of a cult of personality around Ko encounters the problem of her bad songbun, as making her identity public would undermine the Kim dynasty's pure bloodline. Ko's real name or other personal details have not been publicly revealed (her origins could be figured out, as she worked with Mansudae Art Troupe in Pyongyang), so she is referred to as \\"Mother of Korea\\" or \\"Great Mother\\", and the most recent propaganda film called its main character \\"Lee Eun-mi\\". The complications of Ko's songbun were such that after Kim Jong-il's death, her personal information, including name, became state secrets. While songbun is usually passed from the father, Ko's background has the \\"lowest imaginable status qualities\\" for a North Korean.

Heffron. The film is based on the Tison v. Arizona case, which took place in Arizona in 1978. The film first aired on ABC on October 30, 1983, and was released on DVD by Warner Home Video in 2010.  Plot  Gary Tison is serving two consecutive life sentences for murder, while his three young adolescent sons try to move on with their life. The oldest, Donny is the only son making something of his life. He is a pre-law student and is in a loving relationship with his high school sweetheart, Carol. His younger brothers Ray and Ricky, who spend their days doing nothing, decide (convinced that he is innocent) to break their father out of jail. Donny, morally challenged, threatens to give them up to the police. Noticing their determination, he agrees to go along, convinced that they can never break Gary out without his help. The three young men drive up to prison and Donny and Ricky use their guns to keep everyone hostage, while Ray breaks out Gary and his cellmate Randy Greenawalt. Once outside, the gang grabs the car and drives off in the Arizona landscape. An immediate police announcement is made, warning the citizens that the men are armed and dangerous. Donny laughs off the situation, not believing that any of the fugitives could do anyone harm. However, things change when one night Gary decides to change cars to evade the cops. He hijacks a car and forces the people inside to step out. The driver John Lyons, his wife Dannelda, their young niece Teresa, and their baby are terrified of Gary, even though Donny tries to calm them down by promising they will not harm them. Despite John's promise to Gary that he will not call the cops, Gary fears that the man will betray him and decides to kill him and his family. Realizing that his sons will not allow him, he sends them away to get water for the couple, and then shoots all four of them. The sons are shocked and appalled, and realize their father may not be as innocent and loving as they thought. The next morning, while in a gas station shop, Ray tells Donny that they could go to the police, since they were not involved with the murders. Donny, however, silences him and explains that Gary will never let them go away. They go back to their father and go into hiding with a female friend of Randy. The gas station shop owner, meanwhile, has recognized the gang from the paper, and warns the police. They have already fled, though, when they arrive to arrest them, and leave the spot with a newly bought car, heading out to Mexico. In the end, they are ambushed by the cops. Donny is shot to death, and the other sons are arrested and sent to death row. Gary was able to flee the crime, but his body is found eleven days later.

Life  Simon was the son of Count Henry I of Tecklenburg and his wife, Eilike (Heilwig) of Oldenburg (1126 - after 1189). In 1156, he succeeded his father as Count of Tecklenburg, including Ibbenb√ºren. In his time, he was a famous war hero. In 1173, he resigned from the important post of bailiff of M√ºnster. He was a loyal supporter of the Hohenstaufen and in 1174, he accompanied Emperor Barbarossa to Italy. As a captain in the army of Cologne, he fought in Saxony, Holstein, Italy and in Palestine during the Third Crusade. His military career was considered the high point of the history of the House of Tecklenburg. He opposed Duke Henry the Lion of Saxony and Bavaria, because of his bold power grab, and faithfully supported his liege lord, Archbishop Philip I of Cologne. During the Battle of Halerfeld on 1 August 1179, he was captured and had to submit to Henry the Lion. In 1182, he became bailiff of Osnabr√ºck. He founded Essen (Oldenburg) and became its bailiff and also became bailiff of Metelen and Malgarten. For a while, he had to pledge Tecklenburg to Cologne. In 1196, he became Arch- Cupbearer of Mainz. Around this time, he fought some devastating feuds against the Bishops of M√ºnster and Osnabr√ºck and the Count of Ravensburg. He had to cede Iburg to Osnabr√ºck. He laid the foundation for a good administration of Tecklenburg. The first appeared during his reign. He opposed Emperor Henry VI's proposal to make the imperial crown hereditary. He supported the election of Emperor Otto IV in 1198 and became Otto's chancellor in 1201. A major feud broke out against the Counts of Ravensburg, who supported the Hohenstaufen in the struggle for the imperial crown. Simon won this feud, and with it the fiefs Ravenburg had held from the Archbishops of Bremen and Cologne and from the Bishop of Paderborn.  Marriage and issue  Simon I was married to Oda ( - 1224), the daughter of Count Eberhard I of Berg-Altena and Adelaide of Arnsberg.

That concern increases each day that the implementation of systemic risk reform languishes. A sense of complacency has made reforms for effective oversight seem less urgent despite escalating problems elsewhere in the global financial system. In many ways, the financial system faces larger potential challenges today than it did in the run-up to the 2008 crisis, given the troubled state of the European Union and uncertainties at home related to fiscal and monetary policy.

It is headed by a Detective Chief Superintendent and four Detective Superintendents, reporting to the Assistant Commissioner in charge of the Garda National Support Services. Detective Chief Superintendent Michael O'Sullivan is the current head of the Garda Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. History The Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau was formed in February 2015 with the amalgamation of the Garda National Drugs Unit (GNDU) and Garda Organised Crime Unit (OCU) as part of the Irish government's National Drugs Strategy 2009-2016. The National Drugs Unit had been operating since its creation in 1995, often working in tandem with the newer Organised Crime Unit, which was set up on a pilot basis in 2005 and became an established entity in 2008. The merger was announced by Garda Commissioner N√≥ir√≠n O'Sullivan during tough budgetary times in an effort to create a more effective and proactive drugs \\"super unit\\". Organised and serious crime is also the responsibility of the larger Garda National Bureau of Criminal Investigation (NBCI), and the new bureau works closely with the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) and other law enforcement agencies on the international front. Ireland has become a gateway to the European market for international drug smuggling gangs, as well as the domestic market, which has seen disputes spill over into targeted assassinations on the streets of Irish cities. Previous seizures by Garda√≠, the Irish Naval Service and the Revenue Commissioners Customs have come close to topping ‚Ç¨1 billion, with one individual seizure of cocaine off the Irish coast in 2008 estimated to be worth ‚Ç¨750 million.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996 as the Cooke Hydroelectric Plant. Background William Augustine Foote was an ambitious entrepreneur who established himself by developing a series of electric utility companies in Jackson, Battle Creek, Albion, and other cities in Michigan. In 1899, he introduced the concept of high-voltage transmission to Michigan, using a 22,000 volt line to send power from the Trowbridge Dam and Powerhouse to Kalamazoo, a distance of 22 miles. Foote soon became interested in using the steadily flowing Au Sable River to generate power, but was for a time unable to generate the financial backing necessary. However, Foote was involved in other electrical utility activities, including the establishment of the Croton Dam, where power was transmitted over a distance of 40 miles at 110,000 volts. In 1909, Foote consolidated his holdings and merged with other utilities to form Consumers Power Company. With the financial backing of Consumers Power, Foote returned to the Au Sable in 1909 and identified three sites on which to place hydroelectric dams. This site, the first to be developed, was suggested by banker Andrew Cooke, who helped secure financing for the project and became the dam's namesake. A large construction camp was established that same year for the workers on the dam. The river was diverted next, and by mid-1910 the dam foundation was in place. This dam began generating electricity in December 1911, with an original capacity of 9,000 kilowatts,Au Sable River Consumers Energy Transmission line ran 125 miles to Flint at a voltage of 140,000 volts, establishing a world record. Innovations included in the new project were three-legged, windmill-like towers that supported the transmission line and advances in insulator design. The Cooke plant was the first of six Au Sable River hydros completed over the next 12 years. The Cooke plant now generates power at a lower 46,000 volts. However, the plant, and its original generating equipment, is still in use. Cooke Hydro is also part of the River Road Scenic Byway and listed in the National Scenic Byways Program.AuSable River Tour Cooke Dam Au Sable River MI c 1920 Description The Cooke Hydroelectric Plant consists of a series of structures located on the Au Sable River. The main dam is constructed with an embankment on each side connected by a spillway. Located near the spillway is the powerhouse and outdoor substation. Nearby are two separate structures: an attendant's house, and a storage shed. Embankments and Spillway Spillway (powerhouse is at left) The two embankments form a V-shaped impediment across the river. The north embankment is a 572 feet long earthen dam, reinforced on the upstream side by a 12\\"-thick concrete wall. The south embankment is of similar construction but is only 90 feet long. The spillway is controlled by three steel Tainter gates, which are only opened to pass floodwaters. Normal river flow is directed through the powerhouse, which is situated adjacent to the spillway. Powerhouse and Substation Powerhouse, with substation at left The powerhouse is a red brick structure with a green tile roof measuring 116 feet by 67 feet. There are five windows in the main facade with flat arch brick window hoods. Personnel and cargo doors occupy the lower portion of one of the window openings. The interior of the powerhouse is largely open, and includes a basement and mezzanine. Most of the floorspace is occipied by generators and their governors.Generators in the powerhouse are connected to turbines in the adjacent penstock. At one corner of the powerhouse is the outdoor substation, where a small concrete pad supports transformers and other equipment, A chain link fence surrounds the substation. Attendant's House Attendant's House The attendant's house is a 2-1/2 story wood frame building with a front gable. It was built around 1909 to provide onsite accommodations for plant operators, due to the isolated nature of the site at the turn of the century. Access to the plant at that time was either by an 18-mile wagon road or by a 160-mile, narrow gauge logging railroad. The house has a pedimented front porch and dormers and eave returns on the main gable which suggest a Classical Revival style. Round columns once supported the roof of the front porch, but have since been removed when the porch was enclosed. Storage Shed Storage Shed The storage shed is a single story wood frame structure sheathed in board-and-batten siding with double cargo doors on the main facade. The shed is likely a remnant of the original construction camp built to support the construction of the dam.

Gilruth (second from left), Director of NASA's Space Task Group, and chief assistants Charles Donlan left), Maxime Faget, and Robert Piland in August 1960 discuss selection of contractors to study feasibility of a crewed circumlunar mission The Apollo spacecraft feasibility study was conducted by NASA from July 1960 through May 1961 to investigate preliminary designs for a post-Project Mercury multi-crewed spacecraft to be used for possible space station, circum-lunar, lunar orbital, or crewed lunar landing missions. Six- month, $250,000 study contracts were awarded to General Dynamics/Convair, General Electric, and the Glenn L. Martin Company. Meanwhile, NASA conducted its own inhouse design study led by Maxime Faget, intended as a gauge of the competitors' entries. The three companies spent varying amounts of their own money in excess of the $250,000 to produce designs which included a re-entry module separate from the mission module cabin, and a propulsion and equipment module. One week after the presentation of the contractors' designs, President John F. Kennedy committed NASA to a crewed lunar landing, giving the Apollo program an immediate, critical focus. NASA decided to discard the study designs and the mission module cabin, and based the lunar landing mission design on Faget's inhouse design, with a cone-shaped command module, supported by a cylindrical service module containing return propulsion and supporting equipment. This would be carried to the lunar surface by a still-to-be-defined landing propulsion module. NASA then launched another competition for the command/service module procurement contract. In December 1961, GE publicly presented their feasibility study design to the American Astronautical Society . Similarities in the basic mission-command-propulsion module design have been noted to the Soviet Union's Soyuz spacecraft designed by Sergei Korolev and Vasily Mishin. It has been speculated that Korolev and Mishin could have incorporated GE design elements in the existing OKB-1 Sever designs (1959-1962) that eventually became the cancelled Soyuz-A (7K) (1963) and approved Soyuz 7K-OK (1965-1967). Background In July and August 1960, NASA's Space Task Group (STG) hosted a series of NASA-industry conferences to discuss post-Project Mercury crewed spacecraft plans. Deputy Administrator Hugh L. Dryden announced at the conference opening that \\"the next spacecraft beyond Mercury will be called Apollo.\\" Chariots, ch. 1-6: Priming the Pipeline On August 30, NASA presented plans to award three feasibility study contracts for the Apollo spacecraft, conceived as a three-man Earth orbital and circumlunar craft, with growth potential for crewed lunar landings. A Request For Proposal was issued on September 12, and fourteen bids were received by October 9. On October 25, NASA awarded the $250,000, six-month contracts to General Dynamics/Convair, General Electric, and the Glenn L. Martin Company.Chariots, ch. 1-7:The Feasibility Studies Meanwhile, members of the Space Task Group performed their own spacecraft design studies, to serve as a gauge to judge and monitor the three industry designs. All three competitors supplemented the $250,000 contracts with their own money: Convair spent $1 million, GE $2 million, and Martin $3 million.Chariots, ch. 1-8:Portents for Apollo The Manager of GE Space Vehicle Systems (Philadelphia), George Arthur, led the GE proposal team that included Harold Bloom, Charles Bixler, Jacob Abel, and Arnold Cohen. On May 15 to 17, 1961, the contractors presented their study results to NASA. All three designs employed a mission module cabin separate from the command module (piloting and re-entry cabin), and a propulsion and equipment module. Martin studied three different reentry module shapes, including a conical capsule vehicle similar to the STG configuration. GE also studied several reentry module shapes. GD/Convair's proposal employed a lifting body shape. Designs=GD/Convair Model of General Dynamics Corporation's proposed Apollo circumlunar mission design Convair/Astronautics' entry was designed primarily for lunar orbit, with flexibility and growth potential built in to accommodate lunar landing. The company estimated a total program cost of $1.25 billion over about six years. Convair selected a lifting body for the return vehicle (command module), similar to one conceived several years earlier by Alfred J. Eggers of NASA-Ames. This had an abort tower attached through launch, and nestled inside a large mission module. Convair/Astronautics envisioned a progressive flight development plan, with many Earth-orbital missions before attempting circumlunar, and then lunar- orbital missions. Earth landings would be by glidesail parachute near San Antonio, Texas. The development flights would experiment with space rendezvous, docking, artificial gravity, and maneuverable landing, leading to an eventual lunar landing. The study cost the contractor about $1 million. GE D-2 Cross section of the GE D-2 submission, showing complete spacecraft and descent module GE's design capitalized upon hardware almost ready to fly: a bullet-shaped descent module, carried between a conical mission module cabin containing life support and avionics, and the cylindrical propulsion module. The entire craft was long, with one innovation: a cocoonlike wrapping for secondary pressure protection in case of cabin leaks or meteoroid puncture. Had this configuration been selected, the payload sent to the Moon would have resembled the nose cone flown on the early Saturn I rockets. Although GE did not estimate the final costs in its summary, the company was confident of achieving circumlunar flight by the end of 1966 and lunar-orbital flight shortly thereafter. Seeking professional recognition for their design work on the GE proposal, George Arthur and Jacob Abel publicly presented their papers documenting the GE D-2 design in December 1961 at a special symposium of the American Astronautical Society in Denver, Colorado.Arthur, George R, \\"Lunar Spacecraft Designs\\", Advanced in the Astronautical Sciences, Volume 10, 1963, p. 52. Martin Employees of the Martin Company display models of their top three command module designs, and proposal materials The Martin Company spent about $3 million, employing almost 300 persons for the better part of the six-month term, to produce the most elaborate study of the three, not only following all the Space Task Group guidelines, but also going far beyond in systems analysis. The complete proposal consisted of 9,000 pages. Focusing on versatility, flexibility, safety margins, and growth, this was the only study that detailed the progression of steps from lunar orbiting to lunar landing. Martin's spacecraft would have been similar to the Apollo spacecraft that ultimately emerged. When Martin later entered the Apollo hardware procurement contract competition, NASA scored them highest of all the entrants on configuration design. Martin recommended a five-part spacecraft. The command module was a flat-bottomed cone with a rounded apex and a tower for a tractor-rocket launch escape system. Behind the flat aft bulkhead were propulsion, equipment, and mission modules. Tradeoffs between weight and propulsion requirements led to the selection of a pressurized shell of semimonocoque aluminum alloy coated with a composite heatshield of superalloy with a charring ablator. Two crewmen would sit abreast, with the third behind, in couches that could rotate for reentry g-load protection and for getting in and out of the spacecraft. Flaps for limited maneuverability on reentry, a parachute landing system, and a jettisonable mission module that could also serve as a solar storm cellar, a laboratory, or even the descent stage for a lunar lander, were also featured. Spacecraft procurement competition President Kennedy proposes a crewed lunar landing program to Congress NASA did not get a chance to deliberate long on the study results, due to the pressure placed on America's space program by the Soviet's launching of the first man in space, Yuri Gagarin, on April 12, 1961. On May 25, one week after presentation of the study results, President John F. Kennedy proposed the Moon landing objective to the US Congress, giving the Apollo program a clear focus and sense of urgency.https://history.nasa.gov/moondec.html Kennedy speech NASA turned its focus to what relevant data could be mined from the proposals (abandoning the mission module), and launched another competition for the hardware procurement phase, fixing the reentry module configuration to the conical shape designed by Maxime Faget.Chariots, ch. 1-9:The ChallengeChariots, ch. 2-1:May through December 1961 NASA awarded the contract for the Apollo Command/Service Module (CSM) to North American Aviation on November 28, 1961, when it was still assumed the lunar landing would be achieved by direct descent or Earth orbit rendezvous rather than by lunar orbit rendezvous.Chariots, ch. 2-5:Contracting for the Command Module Therefore, design proceeded without a means of docking the Command Module to a lunar lander spacecraft. In the summer of 1962, the selection of the LOR proposal from NASA's Langley Research Center, plus several technical obstacles encountered in some subsystems (such as environmental control), soon made it clear that substantial redesign would be required. By 1963, NASA decided the most efficient way to keep the Apollo program on track and address technical obstacles encountered in some subsystems such as environmental control, was to proceed with the development of two CSM versions: the preliminary Block I, and the advanced Block II.Chariots, ch. 5-1:Command Modules and Program Changes Similarity to Soyuz The Soyuz TMA spacecraft uses a separate orbital (mission) module in front of a descent module shaped similarly to that of the GE D-2. Similarities have been noted between the GE D2 design and the Russian Soyuz spacecraft, which was designed and built after George Arthur and Jacob Abel's AAS presentation (Denver, CO) in December 1961. In particular, Soyuz uses an orbital module located in front of the descent module, which uses a similar sphere-cone-sphere shape. Victor Minenko, one of the OKB-1 designers with Korolev in 1950s and 1960s, who was active with RSC Energia in 1993, noted that in 1961 there were 40 people in several departments working on early designs and versions of the eventual Soyuz. \\"We use to read carefully the U.S. literature by the leading astrodynamicists - Ferri, Chapman, Van Driest, Lees, and the top Russians - Sibulkin, Koropkin\\". Vassily Mishin, chief Soyuz designer after Korolev's death, noted that a logical comparison of the Soyuz was to the US Apollo command/service module, since both were designed for lunar transport. In 1983, Phillip S. Clark and Ralph F. Gibbons discussed the Russian Soyuz program development (1963-1967) and adaptation of design elements from other programs and studies (Soviet and foreign). A similar modular design was used in the Russian Progress spacecraft (essentially the uncrewed version of Soyuz), the Chinese Shenzhou spacecraft, and the planned Indian ISRO Orbital Vehicle.

Jos√© La Luz (Spanish pronunciation [xo'se la luz], born October 12, 1950) is a labor activist and intellectual who organizes, promotes and advocates for worker rights in Puerto Rico and the United States. Under the leadership of labor leader Gerald McEntee, President of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) who assigned La Luz to lead the fight to achieve collective bargaining rights for public workers in Puerto Rico, La Luz is credited as the architect of the grassroots campaign that resulted in the passage of Law 45 in 1998. This law granted bargaining rights and allowed for the unionization of over 120,000 public employees in Puerto Rico.El futuro del sindicalismo estadunidense depende cada vez mas de los inmigrantes, La Jornada, February 21, 1998 (Spanish) La Luz is currently the Associate Director of the AFSCME, Leadership Academy.  Early life  A native of Santurce, Puerto Rico, La Luz comes from a working-class family and spent his primary years living on the island.Cruz, Jose E. Identity and Power: Puerto Rican Politics and the Challenge of Ethnicity. Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 1998, Chapter 5, pp. 108 - 111. La Luz credits his grandfather ‚Äì a self-made small merchant in the mountain town of Ciales- and his mother, a rural school teacher who nurtured and educated poor children in nearby barrios, with being his key role models by mentoring him and instilling a sense of compassion and justice. They were the ones who planted the earliest seeds of consciousness that lead La Luz into advocating for workers rights as an adult, which included bargaining for better wages, work hours, working conditions and overall more humane treatment. While growing up in Puerto Rico in the 1950s and 1960s, La Luz's grandfather used to take him to the tobacco, coffee and sugarcane fields in Puerto Rico where he witnessed first hand the plight of poor Puerto Ricans who were toiling these fields to earn their meager livelihoods. Having seen the swollen bellies of their children who were malnourished and whose fathers pushed relentlessly to work the fields while living in the poorest of conditions ‚Äì many in shacks without running water, electricity and with poor hygienic conditions ‚Äì La Luz began to understand the importance of working for the sensible human rights of those who had no voice. The fight for basic rights and justice for all people, no matter who they were or where they were from became his life's passion. La Luz also credits two past governors of Puerto Rico, Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n and Rexford Guy Tugwell, and U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR), who were household names while growing up in Puerto Rico, as heroes to society. Through these political role models, La Luz observed how valuable and powerful government could be when it stood behind and provided for the common, poor and underserved people. La Luz sites the example of his grandfather ‚Äì who worked in a key New Deal program implemented in 1935 by the Puerto Rico Reconstruction Administration (PRRA) led by then Governor of Puerto Rico Rexford Tugwell, a close ally and former top advisor to FDR. The government effort provided an ongoing domino effect of positive economic recovery and relief for the impoverished families including La Luz's grandfather, whose business had collapsed from the devastation caused by the San Felipe (1928) and the San Ciprian (1932) hurricanes that wiped out major farm crops and ruined hundreds of small farmers and merchants in the island. His grandfather was able to secure gainful employment in one of the PRRA programs thus joining the ranks of the Federal Civil Service that allowed him to support his large family. The PRRA, was one of several alphabet agencies that cascaded from FDR's New Deal promoted by Governor Tugwell to help people in Puerto Rico out of the Great Depression.FDR: An Architect of an Era, Macmillan, 1967. Tugwell stimulated the creation of efficient public services and the development of low cost housing for poor and working families thus giving rise to the middle class in the impoverished United States territory. Without this successful example of the government supporting those who were less fortunate, most Puerto Ricans - including La Luz's family ‚Äì would have remained poor, illiterate, lacked access to healthcare, nutrition assistance, adult education, training programs, and the basic human right to adequate housing. La Luz was highly inspired by Rexford Tugwell‚Äôs overall legacy as well as his book, The Stricken Land: A Story of Puerto Rico,The Stricken Land: The Story of Puerto Rico, Garden City, New York: Doubleday, 1947. which awakened his passion for progressive thinking and the pursuit working on behalf of the needy as opposed to the greedy. Education La Luz attended the University of Puerto Rico where he embarked on the study of social sciences, before transferring with a sports scholarship from the YMCA to Springfield College in Springfield, Massachusetts. He is a graduate of SUNY‚Äôs Empire State College with a Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Labor Studies. Later he obtained a master‚Äôs degree in labor studies at Rutgers University. Widely recognized as a labor strategist and intellectual, La Luz has served as a Visiting Labor Leader in residence at Cornell University, having written white papersLaLuz, Jose (1991) ‚ÄúCreating a Culture of Organizing: ACTWU‚Äôs Education for Empowerment,‚Äù Labor Research Review Vol. I. No. 17, Article 7. Available at: http://digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu/lrr/vol1/iss17/7 on organizing strategies in labor unions, as well as serving as an instructor in the Labor Studies Programs at Michigan State and Rutgers universities. He became a Wurf Fellow in the Kennedy School State and Local Government Program at Harvard University in 2007. In 2011, La Luz received a lifetime award for his distinguished career as one of America‚Äôs outstanding labor educators from the United Association for Labor Education. Activism During his college years, La Luz became involved in the Students for a Democratic Society, speaking out on issues such as the war in Vietnam. He also became involved with local Puerto Rican Farm Workers organizations in the Tobacco Valley in Connecticut and Massachusetts. La Luz was one of the key community organizers to secure new rights for migrant workers in the area by putting public pressure on the Labor Department of Puerto Rico and denouncing the deplorable conditions that the migrant workers were working under. He also helped merge the local farm workers with Cesar Chavez‚Äôs United Farm Workers of America. La Luz credits C√©sar Ch√°vez and Martin Luther King, Jr. as being his greatest influences in understanding the importance of justice and dignity in the quest for civil and human rights. La Luz has described his time as a young adult in Hartford, involved in the Puerto Rico Socialist Party, as a right of passage and one of establishing ‚Äúel orgullo Boricua‚Äù or Puerto Rican pride. This happened during a time where young Puerto Ricans on the mainland were vigorously asserting and affirming their identity, as well as expressing Puerto Rican nationalism ‚Äì a similar sentiment expressed by a more famous, yet parallel organization in New York City, the Young Lords. :‚ÄúIn Hartford, the Puerto Rican Socialist Party looked longingly at events in Latin America, hoping for a world that would include an independent Puerto Rico. And they began challenging an earlier generation of Puerto Ricans in Hartford. The party seemed at times as much neighborhood association as political party, organizing a diverse collection of programs, particularly for youngsters. There were speeches and music by Puerto Rican folk musicians. Everything had an independentista (see independentistas) bent.In Hartford, A Boy Grows Up Alongside Puerto Rican Nationalism, Hartford Courant, November 8, 1999.‚Äù La Luz was eventually expelled from the Puerto Rico Socialist Party because his ideals no longer aligned with the organization. Labeled a ‚ÄúSocial Democrat‚Äù instead of being primarily nationalist, La Luz decided instead to become active in Democratic Party politics. He also began a career as an organizer for several unions, which sought to organize the growing Hispanic workforce in the low wage manufacturing and service sectors. For him, it had become clear that the most important thing to do was to improve the lives of people who needed basic rights. :‚ÄúWe became heretics.

Recent achievements=NAFTA and the ACTWU  La Luz has a long history in Organized Labor, and not just in one union. One of the most important examples of his work is with the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union (ACTWU), a union that played a pivotal role in the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) debates during the Clinton administration in the early 1990s. During that time, La Luz was the international director of the ACTWU when the NAFTA debate to eliminate barriers to investment and trade between the United States, Mexico and Canada raged in the US.Labor unions seeking input in Nafta talks.

In the early 1990s La Luz became one of the leading voices in debating these topics(1994) \\"LRR Focus: Educating Workers About NAFTA, An Interview with Jose LaLuz,\\" Labor Research Review: Vol. 1: No. 22, Article 12.

La Luz engaged in a cross-country discussion with important political figures such as Felipe Calder√≥n long before he became President of Mexico. Restoration of bargaining rights for public workers Among La Luz's most recent achievements is the restoration on May 17, 2011 of public worker rights in Puerto Rico after Puerto Rico Law 45 was nullified by the passage of a new fiscal austerity Law 7 by the current Governor of Puerto Rico Luis Fortu√±o- a Republican- amidst one of the worst fiscal and economic recessions that Puerto Rico has endured. Law 7 effectively suspended collective agreement clauses in an effort to repress public employees and strip them of collective bargaining rights. Law 7 also caused massive layoffs in Puerto Rico of over 19,000 public sector employees and aggravated an already dismal economic unemployment rate that affected thousands of working families struggling to make ends meet.Puerto Rico est√° en paro laboral cr√≥nico, Primera Hora, martes, 7 de septiembre de 2010 (Spanish) http://archivo.primerahora.com/archivo.asp?guid=4D634FF8-72EC-48D0-9F93-C28A52B19934&year;=2010&mon;=9&keyword;=Jose La Luz La Luz was fundamental in speaking out against the injustices by insisting on the need to restore bargaining rights for public workers. In his impassioned speech at the Labor Day celebration sponsored by the President of the PR Senate, La Luz made the case for restoration as he once again led a grassroots lobbying campaign along with other union leaders and the Senate President which resulted in the passage of Law 73 that restored the contracts that had been originally suspended by Law 7.L√≠deres sindicales se abrazan con Luis Fortu√±o, Primera Hora, 17 de mayo del 2011 (Spanish) http://archivo.primerahora.com/archivo.asp?guid=F69012A6-5539-4AB3-B4FB-810C5F435BE3&year;=2011&mon;=5&keyword;=Jose La Luz (Spanish) Publications *LaLuz, Jose (1991) ‚ÄúCreating a Culture of Organizing: ACTWU‚Äôs Education for Empowerment,‚Äù Labor Research Review Vol. I.

Properties Puig proved that if G is a (solvable) group of odd order, p is a prime, and S is a Sylow p-subgroup of G, and the p‚Ä≤-core of G is trivial, then the center Z(L(S)) of the Puig subgroup of S is a normal subgroup of G.

Natural springs are formed from water that naturally flows to the surface from underground. The natural springs can be accessed from the road by stairs leading down to the Au Sable River. Man-made barriers pool the springs and create small waterfalls. The wooden boardwalk stretches over as it winds through the natural springs. Lying off of River Road National Scenic Byway, Iargo Springs provides a panoramic view of the Au Sable River. Used as a drinking water source since pre-settlement times, dams were constructed on the springs by early loggers before the turn of the century. The dams were useful in diverting water to the logging camps nearby. Most of Cooke Pond was dry land then. Europeans have visited the springs for recreation since the 1920s. A trail to the springs was constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1934. Early photographs show the dam being repaired and reinforced by the CCC's. The dams lasted until 1981 when a storm took them out. The site was renovated in 1991. Steps were added and boardwalks along the springs, as well as the dams being rebuilt. For the avid hiker, the Highbanks Trail has a trailhead here which heads directly east, past Lumberman's Monument, another worthy attraction to the Oscoda area. Although the springs are open year- round, the trails are not groomed during the winter months and camping along the way is only allowed in designated areas. Also, the use of motorized vehicles is prohibited on the trail. Interpretive signs help to teach visitors more about the site and its rich but often troubled history as well as explaining the formation and significance of the transition forest.

She is known for creating the adaptation model of nursing. She was a nursing professor at Boston College before retiring in 2017. Roy was designated as a 2007 Living Legend by the American Academy of Nursing.  Education  Roy earned an undergraduate degree in nursing from Mount St. Mary's College in 1963, followed by a master's degree in nursing from University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) in 1966. She then earned master's and doctoral degrees in sociology from UCLA. She served as a postdoctoral fellow in neuroscience nursing at the University of California, San Francisco. She has been awarded four honorary doctorates.  Career  Roy was Professor and Nursing Theorist at Boston College's Connell School of Nursing. In 1991, she founded the Boston Based Adaptation Research in Nursing Society (BBARNS), which would later be renamed the Roy Adaptation Association. She has lectured across the United States and in more than thirty other countries. Late in her career, she studied the role of lay study partners in recovery from mild head injury. She retired from Boston College in 2017 and moved back to California. She belonged to the Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet.  Roy Adaptation Model  During her graduate studies, Roy was compelled by instructor Dorothy Johnson to write a conceptual model of nursing. The Roy Adaptation Model was first published in Nursing Outlook in 1970. In this model, humans (as individuals or in groups) are holistic, adaptive systems. The environment consists of internal and external stimuli that surround an individual or group. Health is seen as a sound, unimpaired condition leading to wholeness. Nursing's goal is to promote modes of adaptation that support overall health. Four modes of adaptation support integrity: physiologic-physical, self-concept group identity, role function and interdependence. In applying Roy's model, the following steps may help to integrate it with the traditional nursing process: assessment of client behavior; assessment of stimuli; nursing diagnosis; goal setting; interventions; and evaluation.

Fischer (October 3, 1872 ‚Äì 1947) was an American male tennis player who was active in the late 19th century. Biography Edwin Fischer won the mixed doubles title at the U.S. National Championships four times. In 1894, 1895 and 1896, he won the title with Juliette Atkinson and in 1898, he won his fourth title partnering Carrie Neely. The mixed doubles championship was played at the Philadelphia Cricket Club. His best result in the men's singles competition came in 1896 when he reached the semifinals in which he was beaten by later multiple champion Bill Larned. In 1897, he again was defeated by Larned, this time in the quarterfinals. In July 1896, he won the Tuxedo tournament in New York City, defeating 1894 and 1895 champion Malcolm Chace. Fischer was a three-times finalist at the Canadian Championships in 1896, 1897 and 1906. He was a runner-up at the 1906 indoor national tennis championship in New York. His highest ranking in U.S. singles was no. 5 in 1896, and he was ranked in the top 10 during four years.

Fischer had been warning his friends of an impending bomb attack on Wall Street, sending them postcards urging them to leave the area before September 16. He was taken into custody in Hamilton, Canada. On return to New York, he was wearing two business suits for warmth and a tennis outfit underneath, which he claimed he wore \\"to be ready for a tennis match at all times\\". The police questioned him at Bellevue. He said he had received the messages \\"through the air from God.\\" Realizing Fischer was suffering from a mental disorder and finding that he made a regular habit of issuing such warnings, the police soon released him and had him committed to the Amityville Asylum where he was diagnosed as 'insane but harmless'.

Skull rejected these proposals, and with the surrender of Italy in World War II, a group of citizens issued a Liburnia Memorandum in which it was recommended that an Italian confederate state be formed from the free cantons of Rijeka (Fiume), Su≈°ak (Sussak) and Ilirska Bistrica (Bisterza), with a planned condominium with the islands of Krk (Veglia), Cres (Cherso) and Lo≈°inj (Lussino). Death On the night of 3‚Äì4 May 1945, following the Yugoslav occupation of Rijeka, Skull was arrested by agents of OZNA and disappeared. His body was found on the riverbed of the Rjeƒçina 25 days later with a gunshot wound to the neck.

J. Grandville's plate of two fables with similar themes in La Fontaine's fables, 1838 The Dove and the Ant is a story about the reward of compassionate behaviour. Included among Aesop's Fables, it is numbered 235 in the Perry Index.Aesopica site The fable There has been little variation in the fable since it was first recorded in Greek sources. An ant falls into a stream and a dove comes to the rescue by holding out a blade of grass to allow it to climb out. Then, noticing that a fowler was about to catch the dove, the ant bit his foot and his sudden movement caused the bird to fly away. In the Renaissance the Neo-Latin poets Hieronymus OsiusFormica et columba and Pantaleon CandidusFable 146 included it in their fable collections. In England it appeared early in William Caxton's collection of Aesop's fablesAesopica site and was later included in those of Francis BarlowA translation of the Latin and Samuel Croxall.Fable 134 It also appeared in Thomas Bewick's Select Fables, but was there told of a bee rather than an ant.p.181 La Fontaine's Fables also include this storyII.12 and underline the kinship between it and The Lion and the Mouse by running the two together under a common introduction: :::To show to all your kindness it behoves :::There's none so small but you his aid may need. :::I quote two fables for this weighty creed :::Which either of them fully proves.II.11 The difference is that while the lion only showed compassion upon appeal, the dove does so out of pure good nature. The story also has details in common with The Fowler and the Snake. In both a bird is saved from being taken by a fowler by his being stung, although the aggressors have very different motives. Other interpretations have been made of the fable. In a 1947 postcard series it is turned into a political statement in the aftermath of the occupation of France by the Nazis. There a little boy with a slingshot distracts a man with an armband labelled \\"Law\\" from chasing a girl who is running away with stolen apples in her pinafore.Creighton University La Fontaine's fable was later set by Paul Bonneau among his 10 Fables de La Fontaine (1957) and Aesop's is the fourth of five pieces by Anthony Plog for narrator, piano and horn (1989/93).A performance on You Tube Later it also appeared among the three in Canadian Yvonne Gillespie's Aesop's Fables for narrator and full orchestra (2001)Canadian Music Centre and among the ten on David P.

He was a director of the Swiss Tourism Federation, member of Swiss Advisory Committee for Trade Policy, and author. Early life Hunziker was born in Zurich on 27 Mar 1899 to Jakob Hunziker, but Walter Hunziker's place of citizenship was Moosleerau, Aargau. In 1917, he completed a two-year primary commercial school (Handelsschule) in Zurich before receiving a Doctorate in Economic Sciences from the University of Zurich in 1923. His doctoral thesis was on the Swiss cotton industry, 1914-1919. Hunziker was first employed by Swiss Natural Gas (Schweizerischen Gaswerke) and the Eidgen√∂ssische Bank, before becoming the business editor and subsequently business and publishing director of the Berner Tagblatt. Science of tourism In March 1936, Hunziker was hired to be secretary of the Swiss Tourist Association and, on 23 Oct 1937, appointed its director. In 1941, Hunziker initiated graduate studies in tourism at the University of St. Gallen. Hunziker founded a Tourism Research Institute at the University of St. Gallen in conjunction with that founded by Kurt Krapf at the University of Berne. The Institute is now known as the Institut f√ºr √ñffentliche Dienstleistungen und Tourismus (Institute for Public Service and Tourism). In 1942, Hunziker collaborated with Krapf (director of the Bern Research Institute of Tourism) to publish the \\"Outline of the General Teaching of Tourism\\" (Grundriss der Allgemeinen Fremdenverkehrslehre), which became the standard work for basic research in tourism.Cf. Spode, Hasso (2009): Tourism Research and Theory in German Speaking Countries. In: Dann, G.M.S/Liebman- Parrinello, G. (eds.): The Sociology of Tourism, Bingeley: Emerald, pp. 70ff. As part of this text, Hunziker and Krapf developed one of the first broadly accepted definitions of \\"tourism\\" (Fremdenverkehr), roughly translated as \\"Tourism is the sum of the phenomena and relationships arising from the travel and stay of non-residents, in so far as they do not lead to permanent residence and are not connected with any earning activity.\\"Perhaps the earliest recognized definition of tourism was provided by the Austrian economist Hermann von Schullard in 1910, who defined it as, \\"sum total of operators, mainly of an economic nature, which directly relate to the entry, stay and movement of foreigners inside and outside a certain country, city or a region.\\" A year later Hunziker published a book on the system of \\"scientific tourism research\\" (System und Hauptprobleme einer wissenschaftlichen Fremdenverkehrslehre) in which he tried to establish a \\"completely new discipline\\" as a branch of sociology; however, the attempt failed.Spode op.cit., pp.71ff. But Hunziker and Krapf continued to examine tourism not only from an economic perspective, but also from a sociological one. Hunziker did not want tourism to have a negative impact on the cultural values of either the destination or the tourist. In 1972, Dr. Hunziker defined the essential elements of tourism science as: * understanding the nature of tourism; * defining and explaining the various terms and concepts associated with tourism; * developing tourism pedagogy that is practical and not just theoretical; and, * addressing problems related to economic policy and business management. Hunziker was an early advocate of the need to apply interdisciplinary scientific analysis to understand the highly diverse nature of tourism, develop a coherent tourism pedagogy, and use that analytical framework and training to resolve problems associated with business management and economic policy. Although Hunziker was an economist by training, he rejected the earlier view of tourism research as a subset solely of economics. Instead, Hunziker viewed tourism more as a cultural phenomenon. As such, he expanded tourism research to integrate aspects of sociology, psychology, history, geography, marketing and law as well as an understanding of how medicine and technology impacts tourism. Social tourism In May 1959, at the second Congress of Social Tourism (Austria), Dr. Hunziker proposed the following definition: ‚ÄúSocial tourism is a type of tourism practiced by low income groups, and which is rendered possible and facilitated by entirely separate and therefore easily recognizable services‚Äù. He viewed tourism as adding value to society by increasing understanding of other cultures and thereby reducing xenophobia and isolationism. For these reasons (rather than looking solely at economics), Dr. Hunziker opined that governments should support and encourage social tourism.  Reka  As a pragmatic implementation of social tourism, Walter Hunziker co-developed the concept of the Swiss travel savings fund (Schweizerische Reisekasse or Reka), which helps low income families enjoy vacations.REKA \\"The Chairman and Director of the Swiss Tourism Federation, Dr Fritz Ehrensperger and Dr Walter Hunziker, came up with the notion together with the Chairman of the Swiss Trade Union Federation, Robert Bratschi, of creating a travel savings fund.\\" Hunziker was president of REKA, 1939-1974.  Tourism institutes and associations  Glion Institute of Higher Education In 1951, Drs. Hunziker and Krapf founded the Association Internationale d'Experts Scientifiques du Tourisme (AIEST) in order to re-connect tourism researchers after World War II. In 1962, Hunziker and Fr√©d√©ric Tissot co-founded the Institut International de Glion. Professor Hunziker was the founding president of the International Organisation of Social Tourism and ran the organization from 1963 until his death in 1974. Consistent with Dr. Hunziker's focus on social tourism, the aim of the OITS is to facilitate \\"the development of social tourism in the international framework. To this end it is in charge of coordinating the tourist activities of its members, as well as informing them on all matters concerning social tourism, as much on the cultural aspects as on the economic and social consequences.\\" Further, OITS continues to promote Dr. Hunziker's interest in \\"access to leisure, holidays and tourism for the greatest number of people - youth, families, seniors and disabled people\\" and \\"fair and sustainable tourism, ensuring profit for the host populations and respecting the natural and cultural heritage.\\" Other professional positions Dr. Walter Hunziker was also Director of the Swiss Federation of Tourism (1937-1945), professor of tourism at the University of St. Gallen (1941-1969), Executive Vice President of the Swiss Federation of Tourism (1946-1964), and a member of the Swiss Advisory Committee for Trade Policy (1946-1964).

The four- wheel-drive lorry with load capacity of 6 400 kg was developed for pulling of heavy cannons of the Finnish Defence Forces.  Development  Based on experience from Sisu A-45 and due to new, heavier cannons, there came a need for stronger vehicles in the Finnish Defence Forces. Due to this, Sisu-Auto started a development project of an entirely new medium size off-road lorry. The engineering work began in 1978 in the main office of Sisu-Auto located then in Fleming Street, Helsinki. The project manager was Seppo Kokkola, the head engineer of the company. The other members were Kari Lindholm, Veli Vallinoja, Uoti Hartikainen and Kalevi Kakko who were the most notable engineers of Sisu-Auto. The starting point was NATO compatibility, which can be seen for instance on the tyre size of 14.00-20 and the general looks of the vehicle. Building of the first prototype was started in November 1979 and the first test run was performed in the following February. In April the prototype was taken to Rovaj√§rvi for field testing and in the following autumn began a half-year testing programme. The vehicle passed the tests of the Defence Forces. The prototype was called SA-140. It was powered by a turbocharged Valmet 611 of which output was 140 kW. The top speed was 100 km/h and with the biggest gear ratio the top speed was 1.6 km/h. The vehicle was clearly larger and more powerful than A-45. Its kerb weight was nearly the same as the gross weight of A-45. At its early development A-45 had been nicknamed ‚Ä≥Proto-Sisu‚Ä≥, referring to prototype, by the Finnish army officers. Obviously, Sisu-Auto did not like this name and named the vehicle Masi, which comes from Maasto-Sisu, ‚Ä≥Terrain Sisu‚Ä≥. Masi is also the Finnish name for Beetle Bailey.  Production  Rear view on SA-150. The production model got a more powerful, 150 kW engine, and was therefore named SA-150. Serial production started in Sisu-Auto H√§meenlinna factory in 1982 and the first delivery lot of 10 vehicles was handed over to the Defence Forces in October the same year. Beginning from the following year the annual production was about 60 vehicles. Almost all vehicles were built in H√§meenlinna, only two small delivery lots at an early stage of the vehicles production cycle were made in Sisu's Karis factory.  Technical data  In the production of SA-150 Sisu-Auto utilised many shared components of other Sisu models, in particular early XA-180 Pasi's.  Engine  The engine is water-cooled, turbocharged six-cylinder in-line Valmet 611 CSBA direct injection diesel of which output is 150 kW and maximum torque 680 Nm.  Transmission and chassis  Behind the engine there is a dry single- plate clutch and six-speed gearbox that was made by ZF. The vehicle is equipped with a two-step reduction gear that doubles the number of gears. Both axles are rigid and driven and equipped with air S cam drum brakes. Suspension is carried out by leaf springs and the front axle has hydraulic dampers. The axle load is nearly even and the frame allows torsional bending which helps the wheels keeping their contact on ground also on rough terrain. The steering system is aided by servo.  Cabin and accessories  The cabin is forward- control type and contains seats for driver and two passengers. Both the cabin and platform are attached on the frame by elastic pads which allow the torsional movement of the frame without twisting the superstructures. The driver's seat can be adjusted for length and height. The heating fan has got two speeds. On the top of the cabin there is a hatch and a frame for camouflage. The platform is designed to carry up to 26 troops. The sides are openable and the platform can be covered by tarpaulin supported by steel frame. The electric system is 24-volt type and includes two batteries, each of 150 Ah. The vehicle is fitted with capacity of 8 000 kg winch with 50-metre cable that can be used both in front and back. Fuel tank capacity is 225 litres.  Characteristics  The vehicle top speed is 100 km/h and its range is 800 km. The off-road capability is good mainly due to the torsionally bending frame. The angle of approach is 42¬∞ and the angle of departure is 39¬∞. The ground clearance is 0.4 m and turning circle 8.2 m.  Variations  The SA-150 was followed by further developed SA-151 which was produced in 1990‚Äì1991. The major difference was the platform that was widened by 100 mm.  Usage  The main purpose of SA-150 is towing of cannons and carrying of ammunition. Its bigger brother is three-axle SA-240.

History=Nineteenth century The Royal Victoria Patriotic Building is a Grade 2 Gothic Revival listed building on the edge of Wandsworth Common, South West London.ALRA: location. Retrieved 8 June 2012. It was built as the school of the Royal Victoria Patriotic Asylum on land enclosed from Wandsworth Common, one of 53 such enclosures made (lawfully) in the years between 1794 and 1866.Wandsworth: The Commons. Retrieved 8 June 2012. The building was designed by Rohde Hawkins in the then popular Gothic style. The foundation stone was laid by Queen Victoria on 11 July 1857; the building was completed in only 18 months. The rapid construction was facilitated by offsite prefabrication of many components such as cast iron windows, stone dressings, roof trusses, iron floor joists and decorative pieces of leadwork. The money for the building came from Prince Albert's Royal Patriotic Fund, which raised nearly ¬£1.5 million by public subscription for the widows and orphans of soldiers killed in the Crimean War.Wandsworth Borough Council: Conservation Area Character Statements: 25: Wandsworth Common. Retrieved 8 June 2012. However, only ¬£35,000 was actually used in the building's construction by George Myers of Lambeth. The orphans lived in hard conditions; they had to pump water up to the tanks in the building's towers, do all the washing, and be washed outside in cold water. When the installed warm air heating system failed, no fireplaces were built in the orphans' quarters. The orphans were reportedly abused by the chaplain, one orphan dying as a result, leading to a scandal. Twentieth century During the First World War, the building was requisitioned by the War Office to create the 3rd London General Hospital, a facility for the Royal Army Medical Corps to treat military casualties. It was refurbished with stronger roof trusses, repointed brickwork, new Westmoreland slates on the roof, and a new heating system. The field behind the hospital was packed with marquees holding about 1,800 soldiers wounded at the front; many thousands of soldiers were treated at the hospital during the war. After the First World War, the building reverted to its earlier use as the Royal Victoria Patriotic School, still for girls, until the children were evacuated to Wales in 1939. During the Second World War, MI5 interrogators including 'spycatcher' Colonel Oreste Pinto interviewed over 30,000 immigrants to the UK at the euphemistically named \\"London Reception Centre\\" in the building over a period of four years. After the Second World War, the building initially housed a teachers' training college. In 1952 it was bought by London County Council; from 1955 it housed Honeywell Secondary Mixed School, followed by Spencer Park Comprehensive School for Boys until 1974. As the building aged, it became structurally unsafe and the school moved to a new building.Park Explorer: Wandsworth: RVPB Grounds. Retrieved 8 June 2012. From 1974, the Royal Victoria Patriotic Building fell into disrepair, losing most of its windows, and thousands of feral pigeons moved in. Thieves stole lead from the roofs and water tanks, allowing rain into the building's fabric: dry rot then destroyed much of the timber structure including floors and door frames. The building came under threat of demolition, but was saved by campaigning by the Victorian Society and the Wandsworth Society, and became a Grade II listed building. In 1980 the Greater London Council (GLC), successor to London County Council, granted a lease with the option to buy the building for ¬£1 to a developer, Tuberg Property Company. Restoration took six years. Just before formal handover by the GLC, the main hall with its elaborate hammer beam ceiling was destroyed by arson. The hall was fully restored from a photographic survey which luckily had been made two weeks earlier. The Civic Trust awarded a commendation in 1985 for the hall ceiling. In 1987 the Civic Trust awarded another commendation for the restoration of the building as a whole. Also in 1987, the restoration won the Europa Nostra Order of Merit.
