Biography Montgomery was born in Fort Collins, Colorado. He graduated from the University of Nevada, Reno in 1934 with a Bachelor of Arts in Journalism. Upon graduation Montgomery was hired by the Nevada State Journal, but left the Journal two years later to pursue work in other media. He returned to journalism in 1938, joining the Reno Evening Gazette, where he first worked as an editor. Montgomery served in the Marine Corps during World War II (1942–45). After the war, Montgomery went to work for the San Francisco Examiner, where he stayed until his retirement in 1975. During his time at the Examiner, Montgomery became involved in two murder trials. He found the body of Stephanie Bryan in May 1955, after being tipped by the real killer, Edward Wayne Edwards, who posed as automobile salesman LeRoy Myers. Burton Abbott was later sentenced to death for her murder. That same year, Montgomery reported on Barbara Graham's execution. His coverage of the Graham case was adapted into the film I Want to Live! (1958). In 1960, 22-year-old Robert Meisenbach was acquitted after being charged with provoking a confrontation between police and students protesting the House Un-American Activities Committee hearings in San Francisco. The charge was largely supported by a story written by Montgomery, which said Meisenbach had clubbed the officer with a baton. Montgomery never testified, after admitting before the trial that his story was false. Montgomery, a longtime water carrier for the FBI, had published it anyway. An 18-page booklet, \\"Communist Target — Youth: Communist Infiltration and Agitation Tactics.\\", signed by J. Edgar Hoover and released to news outlets across the country, which said Communists had orchestrated the protests and used \\"mob psychology\\" to incite the students, portrayed as gullible dupes, was based on Montgomery's false report. Personal life Montgomery was married to Helene Louise Per Lee (1914–2007), whom he had met in college. They had three children: Diana, Douglas and David.

He also became well known for investing his estate’s wealth into expansions and mining ventures, and for large infrastructure projects. Family Richard Newdigate, 2nd Baronet was the eighth child and third (but only surviving) son born to Richard Newdigate, 1st Baronet (1602-1678) of Arbury Hall, Chilvers Coton, Warwickshire, and his wife Juliana Leigh (1610-1685) sister of Sir Francis Leigh of Dunsmore (1595-1653). He was the grandson of Sir John Newdigate (1571-1610), and had five sisters, who he stayed on good terms with for his entire life. His first marriage was to Mary (1646-1692), the daughter of Sir Edward Bagot of Blithfield Hall, Staffordshire (1616-1660), with whom he had seven surviving daughters and four sons. After relations with his family deteriorated in the final decade of his life, he married again to Henrietta (1685-1739), daughter of Thomas Wigginton (1644-1723) in 1704. There were no surviving children from this marriage. His son Sir Richard, 3rd Baronet was the father of Sir Roger Newdigate. Early life Arbury Hall in 1880 Newdigate was born on 5 May 1644. He was entered as a scholar at the age of ten at Gray's Inn, as it was within walking distance of his childhood home at Holborn, and his father was appointed as a sergeant there. He learned basic knowledge in Latin and the basic tenets of the law. At the age of seventeen, he enrolled at Christ Church, Oxford, but did not take a degree. He would however maintain lasting links with the University, particularly through his communication with the Dean of Christ Church, John Fell (1625-1686). Almost a year after his twenty-first birthday, his father passed on all of his Warwickshire lands to him and enabled him to live at the estate in Arbury, which allowed him to collect rents over much of his father's vast land holdings. After the family had settled at Arbury Hall, Newdigate began acting as a broker for Birmingham gunsmiths and drew up a proposal for a canal between the Severn and the Avon. He also undertook a makeover to his estate, adding on a private chapel, stables, and gardens. He was particularly confident in his love of mines and mining, and he strove to construct a waterway from Arbury to Nuneaton by pioneering the use of mining methods in modern construction, a project that was abandoned after his death.. Politics While Newdigate declined an invitation to stand for the parliamentary seat of Lichfield following a vacancy due to death in 1678, he was appointed to the Warwickshire Commission of the Peace, which he was an active member in. However he soon began to show that his goals outweighed his position when he abortively proposed to raise a regiment of men and horses for the War with France, this request was denied and his behaviour during the process led to him being charged with levying men without a warrant, a charge that he was able to have cleared. He lost contesting general elections in 1679, finishing at the bottom of the polls twice. In November of that year, he was dismissed from the magistrate chamber and from his position as gentleman of the privy chamber, however this was brief as he regained his position and was even pressured to accept a peerage. He was elected to the Oxford Parliament of 1681 as knight of the shire for Warwickshire but saw his entire armoury disposed after his implication in the assassination attempt colloquially known as the Rye House Plot. Following the Glorious Revolution, he was restored to the bench and elected to represent Warwickshire in the 1689 Convention Parliament. He was defeated at the general election in 1690 and would never again serve in Parliament. Later life Following his departure from government, Newdigate’s debts increased as did his quarrels with his own family. He had a particularly poor relationship with his older son, whom he described in his own will as \\"my most inveterate and implacable enemy\\" His children petitioned in 1701 and again in 1703 to have him declared as insane but were defeated in court, Newdigate’s outrage at this turn of events was embodied into a pamphlet that he put out that while attention-grabbing, did a poor job of turning public opinion in his favour. He remarried in 1703 to the chagrin of his family, to Henrietta Wiggington, but was not able to produce any more surviving offspring. Newdigate died on 4 January 1710 in London and was put to rest in his ancestral burial grounds at Harefield, passing all of his debts onto his eldest son.

Excuse My French (La Moakhza) is Salama's third feature, a movie that stirred considerable controversy during its release in 2014. The film was rejected by censors more than three times before it was finally released at the beginning of this year. Hany is a bright student, has many friends, likes to go to church and adores his father. With his father’s unexpected death, his mother can no longer afford the expenses of private school, and is forced to send him to public school. There, Hany is mistakenly presumed Muslim, and uses this situation to his advantage. However, when the truth is revealed, he must face a myriad of unforeseen problems. This turbulent comedy about religious and class differences humorously and boldly addresses critical issues in Egypt. The film was initially deemed too sensitive by the censorship board and Salama was forced to adjust the script while trying to preserve the film's core concept of religious discrimination. Even after the changes, though, the censors refused the film again in 2010, claiming that it would fuel sectarian strife and that it did not reflect behaviours that exist in Egyptian society. Plot Taking place in Egypt, Excuse My French follows 12-year-old Hany, played by Ahmed Dash, as he tries to fit in at his new public school following the death of his banker father. The death of Hany's father leaves his mother unable to afford to keep him in private school. Hany's privileged background shows through his style of dress and alienates him for his peers. Another thing that separates him is that he is also the only Christian in a classroom full of Muslims. After Hany is mistaken for a Muslim after a mistake he makes in his French language class. Hany decides to play along in order to gain acceptance from his classmates; to do this Hany tries to excel in science, memorise the Quran, being better at football and learning new music. This works until one day Hany is beaten up by the class bully and his mother takes him to the principal's office. This embarrasses him an serves as the moment when he is unmasked as a Christian. In these interactions the larger context of religious interactions in Egypt and Amr Salama own experiences as a boy are critique in a comical way. Cast * Ahmed Helmy as Storyteller * Hani Adel as Abdallah Peter * Kinda Allouch as The Mother * Ahmed Dash as Hany Abdallah Peter Reception  Critical response  'Excuse My French' has received mixed to positive reviews from the Egyptian and national media. The movie has an average score of 8/10 on IMDb, a score which comes from several critical reviews. Nick Vivarelli, an international correspondent for Variety Magazine, said regarding censorship issues that, \\"the film’s very sensitive subject has also been plagued by problems with the Egyptian censorship authorities who had blocked it at one point.\\" Tom Palmer, of ScreenRellish, said in regards to the humor in the film, \\"[it] lies in its lack of conviction towards its “Faith is for God and homeland is for all” purported message of peace and harmony.\\"  Box office  'Excuse My French' reached the top of the Egyptian box office in the first week of its theatrical release, during which it was shown in 31 theaters.

It always ridicules the work of the journalists, complaining that they weren't taken seriously by either their boss, the interviewee or both, and regularly admitting that they did a lousy job on purpose because they found the job not worthy to be done.

From a bourgeois family in Nort, he was a small landholder, and churchwarden of the parish at the beginning of the French Revolution. Subsequently, he was elected 15 April 1789, as an alternate member of the Seneschal of Nantes to the Estates General and in March 1790, elected to the governing board of the Lower Loire department. He then sat on the Constituent Assembly on September 5, replacing the lawyer Pellerin, who had resigned. Sitting among the majority, he opposed the release of Necker on September 11 and against the motion against the refractory priests on 17 July 1791, the day of the shooting of Champ de Mars. On September 3, the Assembly completed the drafting of the constitution, and a deputation of 60 members is appointed by the President to present the text to the king, the same evening. Maupassant was included in this group as \\"one who would hold the king to his word\\". On 10 September 1791, he was elected as the second alternate member for Lower Loire to the Legislative Assembly and member of the Executive Department. In March 1793, he was sent to Machecoul, by the Department of Management, to organise the mass uprising but was killed by a panic in the first attack of the village by the rebel peasants.

This painting is oil on canvas painted in the style of divisionism.Christine Poggi, Inventing Futurism: The Art and Politics of Artificial Optimism (Princeton: Princeton UP, 2009), p. 66. Divisionism refers to the actual division of colors by creating separated brush strokes as opposed to smooth, solid lines.\\"Deutsche Guggenheim.\\" ‘’Deutsche Guggenheim’’. N.p., n.d. Web. 22 Apr. 2015, http://pastexhibitions.guggenheim.org/boccioni/overview.html. The painting contains three figures, one being Boccioni's mother Cecilia on the left, another being his sister, Amelia on the right, and the third being Ines, his lover, in the center.Ester Coen, Boccioni, p. 41.  Transition Art teacher and portraitist Giacomo Balla introduced Boccioni to the painting styles of divisionism.Ester Coen, Boccioni, xiv. According to the Deutsche Bank and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, divisionism, which emerged in Northern Italy in the late 1880s, was the “painting method [that] was characterized by the juxtaposition of strokes of pigment to create the visual effect of intense single colors”.\\"Deutsche Guggenheim.\\" ‘’Deutsche Guggenheim’’, http://pastexhibitions.guggenheim.org/boccioni/overview.html. These individual strokes vary over the surface of the canvas, resembling “filament-like” threads.Simonetta Fraquelli, \\"Italian Divisionism 1890–1910\\" (The Burlington Magazine [London], 2009). Divisionists also believed in increased luminosity in their paintings.Simonetta Fraquelli, ‘’Italian Divisionism 1890–1910’’ (The Burlington Magazine [London], 2009). As Boccioni was making the transition from divisionism to futurism, he struggled with changing his pre-futuristic subjects of art. This is because typical divisionism depicts rural labor, tranquility, beauty, and landscape. When Boccioni started to draw futuristic paintings, including industrialized scenes and urban modernity, he did not make the smoothest of transitions. Italian divisionism uses a variety of spectral colors to apply the paint in varied dots and strokes. However, divisionism varies from artist to artist; there are no guidelines. Sometime in the years between 1909 and 1910, Boccioni met Fillipo Tommaso Marinetti, the first futurist formulator.Ester Coen, Boccioni, xx. These two men, along with Carlo Carra, Luigi Russolo, Giacomo Balla, and Gino Severini decided to create The Technical Manifesto of Futurist Painters.Lawrence S. Rainey, Christine Poggi, and Laura Wittman, Futurism: An Anthology, (New Haven: Yale Press, 2009). This manifesto describes the theories that make up futurism as well as the guidelines that make a futuristic painting just that.Lawrence S. Rainey, Christine Poggi, and Laura Wittman, ‘’Futurism: An Anthology’’, (New Haven: Yale Press, 2009). Description Three Women is one of Umberto Boccioni's paintings that portrayed evidence of his transformation from the divisionism style to the futurism style. Three Women is a painting that portrays raw emotion, with calmness and intimacy.Emily Braun, Boccioni’s Materia: A Futurist Masterpiece and the Avant-garde in Milan and Paris, p. 24. The faces of the figures in the painting are dressed with melancholy tones. This painting is categorized as a divisionism painting, however there exists a futuristic style within it. The way that the light enters the room and affects the figures is an example of how this painting contains both divisionism and futurism. A characteristic of futurism lies in the varying and visible strokes as well. This aspect of futurism is extremely evident in this painting; it is seen in the women's dresses, the women's hair, the luminescence, the walls in the background, the bed, and the women's faces and skin.Christine Poggi, ‘’Inventing Futurism: The Art and Politics of Artificial Optimism’’, 75. Also, the luminescence mentioned above, according to Maurizio Calvesi, may be in relation to Einstein's concepts of the physical properties of light, adding yet another futuristic aspect to Three Women, he says in 1967.‘’The International Balzan Foundation’’, (April 19, 2015), http://www.balzan.org/en/prizewinners/maurizio-calvesi/research-project- calvesi. According to Ester Coen, Three Women \\"marks a moment of transition in the artist’s work, the bridge from the suburbs of Milan to the idealistic vision of The City Rises\\".Ester Coen, ‘’Boccioni’’, 41.

Robertson and a boarding party of marines boarded the burning schooner Mouche despite fire from the shore batteries that were trying either to sink them or the schooner. By the time Robertson was able to board the schooner part of her deck had burnt away; while the boarding party was cutting away her masts the intense heat discharged all her guns.

When antibodies are afucosylated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) is increased. Background Most approved monoclonal antibodies are of the IgG1 isotype, where two N-linked biantennary complex-type oligosaccharides are bound to the Fc region. The Fc region exercises the effector function of ADCC through its interaction with leukocyte receptors of the FcγR family. ADCC is important in the efficacy of cancer antibodies, but with many approved cancer antibodies there is less ADCC than could be desired due to nonspecific IgG competing with the drugs for binding to FcγIIIa on natural killer cells. Afucosylated monoclonal antibodies overcome this problem through improved FcγIIIa binding. Approaches The Swiss company GlycArt Biotechnology developed a system using CHO cells, where the cells were engineered to overexpress an enzyme called GnTIII. The effect of this overexpression is to block the formation of fucosylated oligosaccharides on the expressed antibodies. This technology was first reported in 1999 and was the basis of GlycArt Biotechnology. Roche acquired GlycArt in 2005 in order to acquire technology to afucosylate antibodies. GlycArt Biotechnology had been founded in 2000 as a spin-out company of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich. The first commercial product from the GlycArt acquisition was obinutuzumab, which as Gazyva gained FDA approval in November 2013 for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.Presentation: GlycArt Biotechnology AG From Inception to trade sale – and what happened after... by Dr. Joël Jean-Mairet.

Neutron Tagging plays an important role in background rejection from atmospheric neutrinos. By implementing early prototypes of LAPPDs (Large Area Picosecond Photodetector), high precision timing is possible. The suggested location for ANNIE is the SciBooNE hall on the Booster Neutrino Beam associated with the MiniBooNE experiment. The neutrino beam originates in Fermilab where The Booster delivers 8 GeV protons to a beryllium target producing secondary pions and kaons. These secondary mesons decay to produce a neutrino beam with an average energy of around 800 MeV. ANNIE will begin installation in the summer of 2015. Phase I of ANNIE, mapping the neutron background, completed in 2017. The detector is being upgraded for full science operation (so-called Phase II) which is expected to begin late 2018. Experimental design ANNIE will be run using the Booster Neutrino Beam (BNB) which runs at 7.5 Hz, with roughly 4 x 1012 protons-on-target per spill. These are delivered in 81 bunches over 1.6 microseconds per spill to a target 100 meters upstream in the SciBooNE hall. The beam, in neutrino mode, is 94% pure muon neutrinos with a flux peak energy at around 700 MeV. The water target used by ANNIE is a cylindrical volume 3.8 m long and 2.3 m in diameter encased by a plastic liner and aluminum enclosure. The target is to be instrumented by 60 to 100 eight-inch photomultiplier tubes. Part of the iron-scintillator sandwich detector used to track the direction of daughter muons in the SCiBooNE target, called the Muon Range Detector (MRD), could be used by ANNIE. The MRD will be modified by replacing 10 of the 13 layers of scintillator with resistive plate chambers (RPCs). This upgrade will allow centimeter-level precision at each layer. Moreover, the RCPs are capable of withstanding a 1 T magnetic field. Such an applied field could someday be added to ANNIE in order to achieve charge-spin reconstruction in the MRD. This would also allow momentum reconstruction at the highest event energies. Given the few-meter scale of the detector, it would be possible to achieve timing based reconstruction of events using information from the Cherenkov radiation produced during events in the detector. In order to achieve the necessary picosecond time resolution, ANNIE intends to use early commercial prototypes of Large Area Picosecond Photodetectors (LAPPDs). LAPPDs Large Area Picosecond Photodetectors are (8 in. x 8 in. x 0.6 in) MCP photodetectors. While common PMTs are single pixel detectors, LAPPDs are able to resolve the position and time of single photons within a single detector with time and space resolutions higher than 3 mm and 100 picoseconds accordingly. Initial Monte Carlo simulations show that using LAPPDs of this accuracy would allow ANNIE to operate as a tracking detector with track and vertex reconstruction resolution on the order of a few centimeters. These detectors are in their final stages of development. Physics goals Standard Model of Elementary Particles The use of a directed neutrino beam allows the reconstruction of the initial neutrino energy and therefore total momentum transfer during the interaction. ANNIE examines the interactions between neutrinos and nuclei in water with the aim of producing measurements of final state neutron abundance as a function of total momentum transfer. Neutron capture is aided by the solvated gadolinium salts which have high neutron capture cross sections and emit around 8MeV in gamma radiation upon absorption of a thermalized neutron. Characterization of neutron yield in proton decay background events, which are predominantly encountered in atmospheric neutrino interactions in large water Cherenkov Detectors like Super-Kamiokande, would help increase confidence in the observation of proton-decay-like events. By studying the neutron yield, the events captured in the fiducial volume may be separated between a variety of charged-current (CC) and neutral Current (NC) event types. The ability to tag neutrons in the final state will also allow ANNIE to test specific nuclear models for validity in neutrino interactions. In neutrino made, the mode in which the beam is predominantly neutrinos, neutron multiplicity is expected to be lower for CC interactions. This can be used to distinguish electron neutrino oscillation candidates from backgrounds such as neutral pion or photon production. Additionally, ANNIE will look for appearance of electron neutrinos in the beam-line. Proton decay Proton decay is a prediction of many grand unification theories. ANNIE will characterize the neutron yield of events that generate signatures similar to those of proton decay in water Cherenkov detectors. The two channels of proton decay that are of interest to ANNIE, and most popular among GUTs are: :{ border = 0 - style=\\"height: 2em;\\"   →   +  - style=\\"height: 2em;\\"   →   +  } The former is the preferred decay channel in minimal SU(5) and SO(10) GUT models while the second is typical of supersymmetric GUTs where dimension-5 operators induce decays that require a strange quark. Super-Kamiokande has shown a minimum limit above 1034 years. In the neutral pion channel, there would be three showering tracks, one from the charged lepton and two from the neutral pion decay products. In order to confirm PDK, two of the tracks must give an invariant mass close to that of the neutral pion, 85 -185 MeV, the total invariant mass given by the tracks must be near that of the proton 800-1050 MeV and the unbalanced momentum must be less than 250 MeV. In this channel, 81% of the backgrounds are charged current events with 47% being events with one or more pions, and 28% being quasi-elastic and in similar ratios when the charged lepton is an anti-muon. In the Charged kaon channel, evidence of the kaon is seen in its decay products, which are a predominantly an anti-muon and a muon neutrino. The second common decay channel of the kaon produces a charged pion and a neutral pion. The subsequent decay of the charged pion produces a muon which is within the detectable threshold for water Cherenkov detectors. Thus both of these channels are also prone to CC atmospheric neutrino background. Proton decay background events predominately produce one or more neutron whereas proton decays are expected to produce a neutron only ~6% of the time Neutron tagging Free final state neutrons are captured in the gadolinium-doped water of the detector. Even neutrons with energies ranging in the hundreds of MeV will quickly lose energy through collisions in water. Once these neutrons have been thermalized, they undergo radiative capture wherein they are incorporated into a nucleus to produce a more tightly bound state. The excess energy is given off as a gamma cascade. In pure water, neutron capture produces about 2.2 MeV in gamma radiation. In order to enhance visibility of neutron capture events, Gadolinium salts are dissolved into ANNIE’s aqueous media. Gadolinium has a larger capture cross- section, around 49,000 barns, and this occurs on the orders of microseconds after the free neutron is emitted. Additionally, the capture event in gadolinium produces an 8 MeV cascade of 2- 3 gammas. The nature of neutron producing processes associated in neutrino interactions is poorly understood, although it’s observed that such interactions at GeV scales readily produce one or more neutrons. The number of neutrons in the final state is expected to depend on the momentum transfer with higher energy interactions producing a larger number of neutrons. This phenomenon has been documented in large water Cherenkov detectors. These characteristic neutrino events constitute a large portion of PDK background. While the presence of neutrons can be used to eliminate background events, the absence of any neutrons can significantly improve the confidence in the observation of a PDK event. ANNIE will attempt to characterize the exact confidence in rejection of background events based on neutron tagging experiments optimized to the application of atmospheric neutrino interactions. Such extrapolation is possible due to the similarity between the flux profile of the Booster neutrino beam and the atmospheric neutrino flux. Neutron Bakgrounds in ANNIE arise primarily from neutrino interactions with surrounding rock upstream. Time-Line Phase one: technical development and background characterization *Begin Installation Summer 2015 *Run Fall 2015 - Spring 2016 ANNIE will aim to characterize neutron backgrounds. Initial runs will be done with 60 Type-S PMTs rather than LAPPDs until these become available. This time will be used to test prototype LAPPDs. Additionally, a movable, smaller volume of gadolinium doped water will be used to measure rates of neutron events as a function of position inside the tank. Phase two: ANNIE physics run I * Installation Summer 2016 ANNIE will begin this phase when sufficient LAPPDs are acquired. This phase involves the use of a full gadolinium-doped water volume, 60 Type-S PMTs, a small but sufficient number of LAPPDs, and the refurbished MRD. The first measurement will be of neutron yield as a function of momentum transfer and visible energy. This phase aims to demonstrate full DAQ, successfully operation of LAPPDs for tracking, successfully operation of the MRD for tracking, and complete timing calibrations. Phase three: ANNIE physics run II * Run Fall 2017 or upon completion of phase II until Fall 2018 This stage represents the full realization of the ANNIE detector. LAPPD coverage will be at over 10% isotropically which corresponds to 50-100 LAPPDs. During this stage, detailed reconstruction of kinematics will be possible, and therefore, measurements of neutron yield for event classes determined by final state particles. Phase III will designed to identify PDK-backgrounds based on simulations and data from Phase I and II.

Chips used include potato chips, tortilla chips, corn chips, bean chips, vegetable chips, pita chips, plantain chips and others. Crackers are also sometimes used, as are crudités, which are whole or sliced raw vegetables. Various types of dips are used to accompany various types of chips. Chips and dip gained significant popularity in the United States during the 1950s, in part due to a Lipton advertising campaign for their French onion dip recipe, sometimes referred to as \\"California dip\\". Specialized trays and serving dishes designed to hold both chips and dip were created during this time. Chips and dip are frequently served during the Super Bowl American football game in the United States. National Chip and Dip Day occurs annually in the U.S. on March 23. History United States The popularity of chips and dip significantly increased in the United States during the 1950s, beginning circa 1954, due to changes in styles of entertaining in the suburbs and also due to a Lipton advertising campaign based upon using Lipton's instant dehydrated onion soup mix to prepare dip. The advertising campaign occurred on television and in supermarket display advertising, and promoted mixing the soup mix with sour cream or cream cheese to create a dip, to be served with potato chips or crudités. This dip began to be called California Dip. The advertising campaign realized significant success, and new, similar dip products were quickly developed thereafter. During this time, unique platters designed for chips and dip service were created that allowed for the containment of several types of chips, and service variations were devised that included serving the dip in a bread bowl or hollowed-out fruit. Chips and dip are a popular food during the annual Super Bowl game in the United States. Eighty-five percent of Americans eat potato chips. With corn-based chips Chips and salsa, typically served using tortilla or corn chips, is a common type of chips and dip dish that gained significant popularity in the United States in the late 1980s. Chips and guacamole, also typically served with corn-based chips is another type, as well as chips and bean dip. Seven-layer dip and tortilla chips is another corn-based chip combination, as is chile con queso, an appetizer or side dish of melted cheese and chili pepper typically served in Tex-Mex restaurants as a sauce for nachos.

Double-dipping ostensibly transfers bacteria from a person's mouth into a dip, which can then be transferred to other consumers' mouths. In March 2013, Tostitos, a U.S. brand of tortilla chips and dips, hired the Ketchum communications agency to perform a survey concerning double dipping that polled over 1,000 Americans. The survey found that 46% of male participants double-dip at a party, compared to 32% of females. 54% stated that they would not consume dip after seeing another person double-dip, and 22% stated that they did not care. 25% stated that they would verbally object to a person caught double-dipping. A study performed by the Department of Food Science and Human Nutrition at Clemson University claimed that three to six instances of double-dipping \\"would transfer about 10,000 bacteria from the eater’s mouth to the remaining dip,\\" which corresponds with \\"about 50-100 bacteria from one mouth to another, in every bite.\\" The study's conclusion recommended that double-dipping should, in their opinion, be curtailed, including tips to prevent it from occurring. A segment on MythBusters in 2009 tested how much bacteria is transferred during the process of double-dipping, finding that there is a transfer but that it, \\"adds only a few more microbes\\". National Chip and Dip Day National Chip and Dip Day occurs in the United States annually on March 23. Tostitos-brand tortilla chips, a major U.S. brand, observed the day in 2015 by providing coupons for free dip for interested customers named \\"Chip\\". In popular culture Double-dipping was used as a plot point in the Seinfeld episode The Implant. One of the main characters, George, argues at a funeral reception with his girlfriend's brother (Timmy) when he is accused of double-dipping a chip. This episode inspired the 2009 segment on MythBusters. In the Mad Men episode \\"Red in the Face\\", Pete Campbell exchanges one of two identical chip-and-dip serving dishes given as wedding presents for a rifle.

It was released on Yahoo! Screen in the United States on April 28, 2015. Plot Greendale decides to cash in on Chang's new-found fame by turning a cop drama Police Justice, into a sci-fi movie. Abed directs the group in the film Chief Starr and the Raiders of the Galaxy, incorporating outtake audio and recycled footage of Chang. The Dean stars as Chang's stand in body double, while Jeff plays the mayor of outer space, Britta plays Princess Meridian, and Annie stars as Scorpio 9, a pleasure droid assassin. Abed is forced to lower his filmmaking standards and asked to edit his film removing Jeff's big scene. Consequently, Jeff has an identity crisis and realizes he will be the last one to ever leave Greendale. At the last minute the film's producer Maury informs the group that the company funding the film went bankrupt thanks to YouTube. Chang comes back to Greendale after he talks back to an unseen Steven Spielberg and is replaced by Randall Park. Cultural references This episode parodies a scene from the original Star Wars when the characters fall into a trash compartment, as well as the films Raiders of the Lost Ark and Guardians of the Galaxy and actor Chris Pratt.

They exist to provide safety as well as information regarding gang activity in an area, and are also commonly found within correctional facilities. GIUs seek advanced awareness of gang activity as a method to suppress gang violence. Intelligence, therefore, forms the foundation of GIUs' efforts to suppress gang violence and crime and maintain safety within the community.Parry, Brian. \\"Intelligence: The Key to Gang Suppression.\\" Corrections Today. 2006. Background In 1967, the Chicago Police Department created a Gang Intelligence Unit (GIU) to respond to Black street gangs. Raids and arrests were conducted, and by the early 1970s Illinois's prisons had a growing Black gang population, including gang leader Jeff Fort, co-founder of the Black P. Stone Nation. The need for gang intelligence units rose during an increase in gang activity in the 1990s. In 1995, the National Youth Gang Center conducted its first assessment of the national gang problem, and concluded that out of the 3,440 reporting agencies, 2,007 reported an issue with youth gangs. The survey counted a total of 23,388 youth gangs and 664,906 gang members, and concluded that many gangs were growing in size. Further studies by the Denver Youth Study and the Rochester Youth Development Study determined that consistent conclusions existed between gang membership and crime, and that being in a gang increases the level of delinquent and criminal behavior as well as violent offending. These findings prompted the formation of gang units within police departments, as many began to realize that gangs should be treated differently than other groups of criminal offenders. However, by the new millennium, the number of GIUs in the country was a fraction of what it was in the early 1990s. In 1993, 76% of all major police departments implemented a GIU, while by 2000, only 48% of all large departments had a GIU. Furthermore, one “unit” was at this time defined as “a separate special unit with one or more full-time employees,” indicating that some departments only employed one single individual tasked with gang intelligence.Specialized Gang Units: Form and Function in Community Policing. Weisel, Deborah Lamm. 2011. Functions and duties The duties of a GIU include training law enforcement officers in recognizing gang activity as well as responding appropriately to that activity. The unit also promotes intelligence sharing among agencies with limited information, and allows them to prioritize their law enforcement activities as well as address trends of gang behavior. In correctional facilities, GIUs provide staff safety and prevent violence against other inmates, the public, and rival gangs. GIUs are also instrumental in identifying active gang members, developing confidential informants, and conducting interviews with other inmates in order to disrupt gang activity.Guidelines for Establishing and Operating Gang Intelligence Units and Task Forces. Bureau of Justice Assistance, US Department of Justice. October 2008. Gang intelligence units assist the administration of correctional facilities in planning, formulating, and implementing strategies and policies related to gang management. This allows for administrators to make informed strategic decisions, allocate resources, and request funds to ensure the safety and security of the facilities. In the past, GIUs have been instrumental in thwarting violent plots to injure or kill other inmates or corrections faculty as well as gangs’ planned criminal activity within the community. They have also been used to gather information on active or recently inactive gang members, leaders, or associates and developing confidential informants. This, in turn, can lead to the confiscation of weapons and contraband. GIUs, particularly those within correctional facilities, utilize both tactical and strategic intelligence processes. Tactical intelligence may be used for arrests, imprisonment, lockdowns of facilities, transferring an inmate, and conducting searches. Conversely, strategic intelligence supports long-term planning, identification of emerging problems such as new gangs or membership, and following trends and patterns of gang behavior. GIUs will often follow the processes of the traditional intelligence cycle in order to respond to gang activity in an area. GIUs seek to promote staff safety, violence prevention, crime solving, and the development of information sources.Guidelines for Establishing Gang Intelligence Units. Gang Intelligence Strategy Committee. 2008. General principles that are critical to operating a successful GIU include: committed leadership; commitment of participating agencies, policymakers, leadership, and team members; a clear mission; frequent and ongoing communication; attentive direction; evaluation; refinements and self-improvement; and sustainability of finances and personnel. A comprehensive data collection plan is also essential to GIUs, as is a definition that law enforcement can use to effectively identify gang activity. The development of indicators for gang activity will greatly assist the GIU in developing a database of gang members and associates. Sharing this information with other levels of law enforcement will also serve to decrease redundancy and overlap of gang information within a particular area. Challenges GIUs also face several challenges with curbing gang activity. Distinguishing between “gang-related” crime and “gang- motivated” crime can be difficult, though it is an important distinction for GIUs to make. However, a lack of historic data on gang activity can compound the difficulties GIUs already face. The mobility and ease of communication among gang members also presents challenges for these units, and gangs are constantly evolving in response to the actions of law enforcement. Due to the challenges law enforcement agencies face in addressing gang activity on their own, GIUs promote collaboration and sharing of intelligence to combat gang activity and work with other agencies to dismantle larger gang networks. This sharing of intelligence remains a vital component to the operations of a GIU within correctional facilities, where the collaboration is sometimes referred to as police/corrections partnerships, as well as among law enforcement agencies. Intelligence sharing also helps to adequately train staff to respond to the gangs’ modus operandi, which can change as a result of new law enforcement policies or operations. Officers, therefore, must possess strong communication and analytic skills as well as a working knowledge of gangs and how they operate both within and outside of a correctional facility. They must also be skilled at forming liaisons with other agencies, interviewing gang members and inmates, sharing relevant information with staff and keeping a proper chain of command, and advising parole staff of which active gang members may pose a threat. Community Oriented Policing (COP) is a strategy that GIUs use to address challenges with handling gang activity. In this strategy, officers will make informal contacts with the members of a community to address the community’s major problems and issues in anticipation of acquiring new sources of information (informants). By interacting frequently with the public, officers are notified of key concerns and can implement problem-solving techniques more easily.Pelfrey, Jr., William V. “Parallels between Community Oriented Policing and the War on Terrorism: Lessons Learned.” August 2006.  Gang databases  In the United States, the New York City Police Department maintains a gang database. The state of California has an electronically generated statewide database called \\"CalGang\\" administered by the state attorney general. To improve Gang intelligence, police officers have came up with a mechanism that ostensibly distinguishes \\"gang-related\\" crime and \\"gang-motivated\\" crime . This system provides a time-oriented form of Gang intelligence, that plausibly enhances officers' safety and identifies and tracks gang members within their community. These databases record information about individuals considered to be at risk for a crime or people suspected for past crimes.  Criticisms  Opponents of gang policing methods claim that they encourage racial profiling and are not justified by the magnitude of gang activity. In 2013, the NYPD identified 264 gang-motivated crimes and transferred at least 300 officers to its Gang Division. Additionally, between January 2014 and February 2018, 99% of individuals added to the NYPD gang database were nonwhite.

The Committee of Public Instruction continued to exist under the National Convention, with new elections in 1792 and remained for many years, radically changing form over time. In July 1793, Maximilien Robespierre created a Commission of Public Instruction as a subsidiary to the Committee of Public Safety. Though in discussions concerning the French Revolution, other aspects are often given precedence, the French educational system experienced serious reforms throughout the time period. Leaders of the Revolution, placed great emphasis on the future of French education. This Committee served crucial in removing the Catholic Church from the educational system, collecting the proposals concerning education of the French citizens, and improving the quality of French teachers. They focused on such education issues as, \\"the duties and prerogatives of the state, the rights of parents, the potential benefits of higher education, the economic needs of the nation, the necessity for training teachers, and the suitable status of the teaching profession in a republic.\\" The Committee of Public Instruction included such prominent figures as, Lazare Carnot, a renowned French politician, engineer, and mathematician who wrote many educational reforms on behalf of the board. This Committee failed to radically improve French education as a whole. Origins and evolution  Dechristianization Once established in 1793, the Committee of Public Education first approached the matter of religion. Throughout the nation, revolutionaries were rejecting and destroying many of the powerful old orders. The Catholic Church in particular was a dominant pre-revolution power. The Church controlled primary and secondary education throughout France. Prior to the revolution, France’s century-old Church-run educational system provided classical schooling to around 50,000 young men. Recognizing the importance of eliminating the Church’s power over education, the Committee of Public Instruction scrapped the entire system. They seized Church held properties, terminated priests and school teachers, and began recreating and reorganizing French education. Through new policies and anti-catholic propaganda, this Committee successfully lessoned the power of the Catholic Church in matters of education.  Advancements in education Throughout the Reign of Terror, methods to improve the French education system were often discussed but were not implemented. For example, Nicolas de Condorcet, a renowned French philosopher and political scientist, drew up an extensive plan for universal French education that was not adopted due to costly military operations abroad. The mass executions and political tension common from September 1793 to July 1794 clearly proved a distraction to the Committee of Public Instruction. It took the execution of Maximilian Robespierre, one of the most influential figures of the French Revolution, and the subsequent end of the Reign of Terror to bring enough relative internal peace to allow for substantial educational reform. Secondary schools were eventually set up in the large urban metropolises attracting young men throughout France. Where the old schooling system emphasized religious virtues, this new and expanded system promoted the modern sciences and the preparation of young men for the \\"new regime\\". However, the entirety of education still remained off-limits to females. Originally, teacher salaries were set by the national government and strictly regulated, demonstrating the importance placed upon education. The emphasis placed on education during the French Revolution allowed for the general improvement of schooling throughout France, as well as enforced linguistical conformity in an attempt to eradicate patois or local dialects of French. Many aspects of educational reform through the Committee of Public Instruction were successful, yet, overall the schooling system remained quite weak.

The plot follows a tavern owner in Portland, Oregon, who is involved in a struggle for power between two gangs attempting to control the unions. The film was inspired by crime boss Jim Elkins and The McClellan Committee's investigation into Portland's underground criminal ventures in the 1940s and 1950s, which were the subject of an extensive article published in Life magazine in March 1957. The film was distributed theatrically by Allied Artists in August 1957, though it was banned by local agencies from being screened within a radius of Portland. Plot In 1940s Portland, Oregon, tavern proprietor George Madison resides with his wife Clara and their two children, teenage Ruth and young Jimmy. Pressured by salesman Spud Lennox, George agrees to place pinball machines in his business. Meanwhile, syndicate thugs Larry and Joe are attempting to start a gang war by pitting rival pinball and gambling operations against each other. Under the supervision of their boss, Phillip Jacman, they report the names of various businesses housing the pinball machines, and Jacman orders them to pressure George into installing their machines into his tavern. The syndicate selects George's business as a target. Larry and Joe confront George at his tavern, and bully him into agreeing to put their machines in his business. George agrees to do so, and divide the profits in half. The installation of the syndicate's rival machines results in an increase in George's business, but Clara disapproves of the gambling connected to them. George agrees to covertly arrange a police raid at the tavern to eliminate the syndicate's presence; however, the raid is botched when police find nothing incriminating in the building. George meets with Portland's former crime boss, who warns him that the new syndicate will expand their enterprise to include drug trafficking and prostitution. Later, Ruth goes on a date with her boyfriend Benny, but he leaves her when she refuses to have sex with him. Outside the tavern, Ruth is accosted by Joe, who has been stalking her; Joe attempts to rape her, but George interferes when he hears her screams. George overpowers Joe and holds him at gunpoint, but ultimately lets him free. Later, Larry executes Joe at Jacman's instruction. Shortly before Clara is to leave to her mother's home in Corvallis with Ruth and Jimmy, Benny visits and apologizes to Ruth. Meanwhile, trade union leader Alfred Grey begins investigating the syndicate. George is formally initiated into the syndicate after proving his loyalty, and uses his insider position to provide Alfred with information to bring them down. George wears a wiretap in an attempt to record damning evidence incriminating the syndicate. One night, Clara phones George to tell him Ruth is returning home to attend a fraternity party with Benny. A worried Clara decides to leave Jimmy with her mother and return to the city to find Ruth and George. While George attends the syndicate's party for a madame who has recently arrived in Portland to operate a high-end escort agency, a prostitute there named Iris discovers George is wearing a wire, and informs the syndicate. Immediately, several men are sent to George's house to find any tapes he may have recorded, and stumble upon Ruth, whom they kidnap. George is abducted from the party and taken to the syndicate's headquarters in a secluded warehouse. When he refuses to provide information, the syndicate beat him mercilessly before threatening to blind Ruth with acid. George claims to have buried the tapes in the woods, prompting the thugs to untie him so he can lead them to their location; when they do so, George flees with Ruth through the warehouse. The two are ultimately saved by the unionists, led by Grey, who fight off the syndicate, allowing Ruth and George to escape to safety. Cast Production Filming of Portland Exposé took place in Portland and Gresham, Oregon. Release Allied Artists released Portland Exposé in the United States on August 11, 1957, though approximately 20 cities in the Pacific Northwest pulled the film from their screening schedules, and it was banned within a -radius of Portland, where it had been scheduled to premiere on August 14. An agent who canceled the Portland premiere stated that his primary reason was that approximately 40 individuals involved in the crimes the film was based on had threatened to sue should the film be shown there. The film continued to screen throughout the country, opening in New York City on September 26, 1957. Critical response Dorothy Masters of the New York Daily News noted that the film \\"has more integrity than most of its genre,\\" and praised the direction and cinematography. Myles Standish of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch was less impressed by the film, deeming it \\"one of those quickie sensations which exposes nothing except the producer is hot after a fast buck... it is a trite B melodramatic crime plot, people obscured by actors.\\" A review published in The New York Times questioned the film's validity, noting: \\"At the end of Portland Expose, which arrived at Loew's State yesterday, there is a pretentious and cloying reference to the United States Senate investigation earlier this year into corrupt labor practices in the Pacific Northwest. Whatever the real situation may have been in Portland, Ore., an observer cannot help wondering whether it possibly could have borne such a striking resemblance to standard crime melodrama as Portland Expose would have us believe.\\" Home media The film was released on DVD as a double feature with They Were So Young (1954) by VCI in 2006, as volume 1 of their \\"Forgotten Noir\\" series. VCI reissued the film on DVD as a standalone release in 2011.

She moved to California in 1955, first living in Marin County, before settling in San Francisco in the early 1970s where she purchased and restored Nightingale House, located on Buchanan Street to landmark status. Hanson obtained a Master of Education from the University of Illinois and a Master of Fine Arts from San Francisco State University. Hanson died at her home, of cancer, on March 13, 2007.  Career  As an extension of her work on the Nightingale House, Hanson set out to address the litter on her street. Her commitment to sweeping the sidewalk outside her home evolved into a public art project and citywide initiative against littering. Hanson's work was known for incorporating the detritus she collected while sweeping. She analyzed and classified what she found as a way of documenting daily life in her district and felt that it reflected a disconnect between the consumption and production of goods and the natural world. For six years during the 1980s Hanson was a vocal member of the San Francisco Arts Commission pushing for the inclusion of underrepresented artists of in the city's art collections, specifically women and people of colour. She also played a key role in saving the murals of Coit Tower and the restoration of the murals at Golden Gate Park's Beach Chalet. In 1990 Hanson conceived of and initiated the establishment of the Artist in Residence Program at Recology. The residency assists artists who use discarded materials in their art and raises public awareness about recycling. Its launch coincided with the introduction of curbside recycling in San Francisco due to state legislation passed in 1989. To date more than 100 artists have participated in the program including Estelle Akamine, Jim Growden, Susan Leibovitz Steinman and William Wareham. Recology has also influenced the development of similar programs such in Philadelphia and Portland. Awards In 1997 Hanson was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Northern California Women's Caucus for Art.  Works  One of Hanson's best known works was Crab Orchard Cemetery, a recreation of her ancestral cemetery in Illinois, which opened at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. in 1974.

It is the fourth installment of the Five Nights at Freddy's series. It was originally planned for release on October 31, 2015 however the game was pushed forward to August 8, then down to July 23 when it was unexpectedly released on Steam. It was released for Android devices on July 25, 2015, and for iOS devices on August 3, 2015. A Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One port was released on November 29, 2019. Announced in mid-2015 under the working title Five Nights at Freddy's: The Final Chapter, the game is considered a departure from the previous games, which took place in a security office. Instead, the game takes place in a child's bedroom, placing an emphasis on timing and auditory warnings to complete nights. Upon release, the game received polarizing reviews from critics; praise centered on its unsettling atmosphere, while others were divided over the game's new mechanics. Five Nights at Freddy's 4 is the only game in the entire series that has no spoken dialogue. The fifth installment, Five Nights at Freddy's: Sister Location, was released on October 7, 2016.  Gameplay  Unlike previous Five Nights at Freddy's games, the game is not set in a security office, but in a child's bedroom. There are no security cameras and instead of \\"Phone Guy\\", the player is given on-screen instructions to help the player during the game. The player is equipped with a flashlight, similar to the second game, although the light has unlimited power. It can be used to ward away any animatronics seen down the hallway; however, if the player hears either Nightmare Bonnie's or Nightmare Chica's breathing at the door or they see Nightmare Fredbear or Nightmare upon turning on the flashlight, they must immediately close the door. Despite this, the door will eventually open ajar as the player walks away. The player must also monitor the closet to avoid getting attacked by Nightmare Foxy by closing it if necessary, similar to the first game, as well as shooing three miniature animatronics (nicknamed 'Freddles' by the Five Nights at Freddy's community) off the bed before they, once all three are together, summon Nightmare Freddy to attack the player. If the player is not careful in shining the light towards the hallways or leaves the doors, closet and bed unattended for too long, the player will be jumpscared, leading to a game over. After beating each night, the player may play a timed minigame titled \\"Fun with Plushtrap\\" (In Halloween update, Plushtrap is replaced by Nightmare Balloon Boy) in which a plush edition of Springtrap, the central animatronic in Five Nights at Freddy's 3, must be lured to the top of an \\"X\\" marked on the ground within a specific amount of time. If the player succeeds, the player will start the next night at 2:00 A.M. (1:00 A.M. in challenge modes) Like the nightmare animatronics, this timed minigame becomes more challenging as the game progresses. The time bonus does not apply to the unlockable modes. Additionally, if the player gets a game over, the bonus is no longer valid for further plays of the same level. Like previous games, the game's main storyline takes place over five increasingly-difficult nights with unlockable extra levels. The first four nights will put the player against four animatronics: Nightmare Freddy, Nightmare Bonnie, Nightmare Chica and Nightmare Foxy (Nightmare Mangle in Halloween update). Nightmare Fredbear, who combines the scare tactics of the previous four, is the sole attacker on the fifth night. Completing all five nights will unlock an additional sixth night, where the four animatronics will haunt the player until Nightmare Fredbear takes over when the clock hits 4 AM. Completing the sixth night will unlock the \\"Nightmare\\" night, where the animatronics are very persistent and Nightmare Fredbear is replaced by the highly aggressive Nightmare, who has a unique game over screen compared to other animatronics. A secret code will unlock an eighth night or called as 20/20/20/20 mode based on the Custom Night modes from the first two games, which sets the A.I. of the animatronics to maximum difficulty. Other unlockables include galleries of the various animatronics and jumpscares, as well as behind-the-scenes looks at the 3D-modelling process for Fredbear and Foxy. As in most of the previous entries of the series, the story of the game is revealed in interactive Atari-style minigame sections between nights. Each of the minigames are set in a time frame corresponding to the five nights, beginning with \\"5 days until the party\\", up to \\"0 days until the party.\\"  Plot  The game starts with a minigame which shows a boy who is locked in his bedroom with plush toys, which he calls his only friends. After the player survives the first night, the boy's Fredbear plush tells him that \\"he\\" (the boy's older brother) is hiding in the house, before the boy is jumpscared by him, who is wearing a Foxy mask. After the second night, the boy is abandoned at the pizzeria (implied to be the Fredbear's Family Diner briefly mentioned in the second game), only to be warned by the plush Fredbear's voice that \\"he\\" is coming and that he must be brave; however, since the boy is afraid of the animatronics and costumed mascots, he ends up bawling. An easter egg during this scene briefly shows William Afton from the second and third games fitting someone into the Spring Bonnie suit. After the third night, the minigame reveals that other children tease the boy, calling him a coward and crybaby, and that there are rumors of the animatronics coming to life at night and attempting to murder people. The boy sees his plush toys as his only friends and generally eschews interaction with other people in favor of them. Another easter egg in this minigame establishes the time period, via a commercial or TV show named \\"Fredbear and Friends\\" dated 1983. After the fourth night, it is revealed that the boy was once locked in the building's parts and services room as a prank. If the fifth night is completed, the boy is shown crying at his birthday party in the pizzeria, with his brother (alongside other bullies) wearing the masks of the animatronics to terrorize the boy. The bullies, deciding to prank the boy, grab him and try to get him close to the Fredbear animatronic's mouth for a \\"kiss,\\" and end up stuffing the boy's head into the animatronic's mouth. Suddenly, Fredbear, who was in the middle of singing, forcefully closes his mouth, and crushes the boy's head while his brother and his friends stare in sheer horror, realizing their mistake. After the sixth night, the boy hears his older brother apologizing to him as the Fredbear plush promises him that no matter how many times he \\"breaks,\\" he and the others will always be there to \\"put him back together\\" and will always be his friends. The characters then fade out one by one, and the faint sound of a heart monitor flatlining can be heard, indicating the death of the boy and ending the minigames. Following this, the player unlocks Nightmare mode, which is the same as the sixth night with the exception of a new animatronic, Nightmare, a more aggressive version of Nightmare Fredbear. There is a divide in the FNaF community about who had the nightmares. Some say it’s the bite victim, as he’s scared of the animatronics and you play as him during the minigames, while others say it’s the older brother because after seeing his brother get killed, he got nightmares because of Posttraumatic stress disorder. If the player completes Nightmare mode, an image of a locked metal trunk is displayed; if the player wiggles the padlocks, the game states that \\"Perhaps some things are best left forgotten, for now.\\" Cawthon remained cryptic about what is inside the trunk, and eventually announced that he would not disclose what was in it. He gave only one clue: \\"What's in the box? It's the pieces [of the franchise's story] put together.\\" Throughout the game, if the screen is brightened or the player looks closely enough, the progression of the fate of the child can be seen through objects next to the bed. When the player turns to the bed, looking to the left of the Freddy plush, three objects appear at different points in time: a bottle of pills, an IV drip, and a vase of flowers.  Development and release  Beginning April 27, 2015, Cawthon posted images on his website teasing at another game in the series, originally known as Five Nights at Freddy's: The Final Chapter. The images, featuring the characters from the series, cryptically teased at a release on Halloween. A trailer was released on July 13, 2015, hinting that the game took place in the main character's house. The subtitle, The Final Chapter, was dropped. A demo for the game was released to select YouTubers on July 21, 2015, with the full game being released on July 23, 2015. The game was released for Android devices on July 25, 2015, and for iOS devices on August 3, 2015. On October 31, 2015, two updates for the game were released. One consists of a set of cheat options, challenge modes, and an altered version of the \\"Fun with Plushtrap\\" minigame that uses a nightmare version of the character Balloon Boy (from Five Nights at Freddy's 2) in place of Plushtrap. The second is a \\"Halloween Edition\\" that makes cosmetic changes to Nightmare Bonnie and Nightmare Chica, and introduces nightmare versions of the Five Nights at Freddy's 2's characters Mangle and The Puppet, (known as Nightmarionne in-game) the former replacing Nightmare Foxy and the latter replacing Nightmare. Nightmare Chica's cupcake is also replaced with a Jack-o-Lantern. Reception The PC version of the game received an aggregate score of 51 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 6 reviews. Destructoid criticized the gameplay as being too confusing, and gave the game a review score of 4 out of 10. The Escapist gave the game a positive review score of 4 out of 5 stars saying that they liked the reworked mechanics, darker and emotional storyline, scary jumpscares, and sad ending but noted the game's bugs and glitches. Nadia Oxford of Gamezebo gave it 4 out of 5 stars in her review praising it for its intense environment, creepy sounds and graphics, and jumpscares. She criticised the game for being difficult to survive in certain environments when relying on audio cues and the Android version not containing the story-centric minigames.

It is a rare species, known from one nature reserve. It is similar to Melaleuca tinkeri, mainly differing from it in having hairy leaves and petals. (The leaves of M. tinkeri are glabrous.) Description Melaleuca genialis is a shrub growing to about tall. Its branchlets are covered with soft, silky hairs when young but become glabrous with age. The leaves are arranged alternately, long, wide, linear to narrow egg-shaped and tapering to a non-prickly point. They are also covered with soft, silky hairs and have single mid-vein. The flowers are a shade of pink to purple and are arranged in heads on the ends of branches which continue to grow after flowering. The heads are in diameter and contain 5 to 7 groups of flowers in threes. The petals are long and fall off as the flower matures. The stamens are arranged in five bundles around the flower, each bundle containing 2 to 5 stamens. The main flowering season is in October and is followed by fruit which are woody capsules long. Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca genialis was first formally described as a new species in 2010 by Brendan J. Lepschi. The specific epithet (genialis) is from the Latin word meaning \\"jovial\\" or \\"pleasant\\", referring to \\"the staff at the Western Australian Herbarium in the 1990s\\". Distribution and habitat Melaleuca genialis has a restricted distribution in a nature reserve near Wagin in the Avon Wheatbelt biogeographic region. It grows in woodland in clay soils.

The story is narrated by the titular cat-eyed boy, hated by both humans and demons, who gets involved in tales of horror including monsters and children. The manga was initially serialized in 1967 in Shōnen Gahōsha's manga magazine Shōnen Gaho and eventually two other magazines, and has been compiled and published several times in different formats. In 2008, Viz Media licensed and released the manga in North America in two omnibus volumes. The manga has also been adapted into an anime series in 1976 and a live-action film in 2006. The manga has been noted for Umezu's grotesque style of Japanese horror storytelling and art. Response to the design of the Viz edition has also been positive. Plot Cat Eyed Boy revolves around the unnamed titular character, a monster born to a in the mountains, only to be abandoned by them for being too similar to a human. After disaster strikes his childhood village despite his attempts to save it, he becomes a wanderer. Each chapter tends to follow a pattern wherein the boy visits a new location and moves into the attic of a human family, only for the family to be plagued by a supernatural threat. Despite often using his own supernatural abilities to oppose the violent monsters he encounters, the boy is invariably blamed by humans for the mysterious happenings. Stuck between two extremes and unable to fit in with either, the boy's main companions end up being cats, with whom he can communicate. Although he possesses many unusual abilities, such as regeneration and illusions, he is often outmatched by the more bloodthirsty monsters he encounters and forced to escape using trickery. Although he tries to warn and assist humans, he is a morally gray character that takes great pride in his status as a monster, even if other ones despise him, as seen in the Band of One Hundred Monsters arc. He has no qualms about seeing unpleasant and evil people punished, and sometimes even sides with supernatural beings when they target someone he dislikes. Media Manga The manga was first serialized in Shōnen Gahōsha manga magazine Shōnen Gaho in December 1967 until May 1968 for the stories \\"The Immortal Man\\" and \\"The Ugly Demon\\". Five more stories until \\"The Thousand-Handed Demon\\" were serialized in Shōnen Gahōsha's Shōnen King until 1969. The series was continued in Shogakukan's Weekly Shōnen Sunday for four more stories in 1976. The chapters of the manga were first compiled together by Shōnen Gahōsha into 3 volumes starting in 1969. After that, Shogakukan published the manga in 1976 under its imprint Shonen Sunday Comics as 5 volumes. The third publisher, Asahi Sonorama, published the manga in 1982 under its Sun Comics imprint as 5 volumes also. Asahi Sonorama then republished the manga in 1986 as 3 volumes under its Sun Wide Comics imprint. Shogakukan republished the manga in 1991. Because of the release of the 2006 film adaption of the manga, Shogakukan republished the manga as 2 large volumes on June 16, 2006. In January 2008, Viz Media listed 2 volumes of the manga on the online retailer Amazon.com with page counts corresponding to the 2006 Shogakukan 2-volume edition. The 2 volumes were subsequently released in June 2008 under its Viz Signature imprint. The design of the manga as well as its size in dimensions and length have been complimented by reviewers. Veronica Casson, the designer for the Viz edition of the manga, noted that unlike many of her previous titles, she was given freedom to design the book without adhering to the original Japanese version. In an interview with Alvin Lu, the Vice President of Viz Media, Lu stated that Viz focused on presenting the content of the book as much as possible which influenced the decision to release omnibus editions as well as the cover design. Anime In 1976, the manga was adapted into an anime series called . The anime was produced by Wako Productions and TV Tokyo. The series contained 22 episodes of 15 minutes each. Live-action film In 2006, Noboru Iguchi directed a live-action film adaption of the anime. The movie, with gravure idol Miku Ishida, Asami Kumakiri, Hiromasa Taguchi, Naoto Takenaka and Kanji Tsuda, was released theatrically in Japan in June 2006, and on DVD in October of the same year. Reception Response to the manga has been positive overall, with critics applauding Umezu's grotesque style of horror, but also recognizing its similarities to low-budget horror of the past. Critics have likened the manga to pulp horror and to the television series Tales from the Crypt, but also acknowledged its divergences such as the focus on the narrator himself. The art has been complimented for creating a dark atmosphere, as well as for Umezu's imaginative monsters. Critics have also noted that the manga will likely be more appealing to audiences interested in manga classics rather than modern horror fans. Opinions on the effectiveness of the short and long stories has been mixed. Carlo Santos of Anime News Network criticized the similarities of the stories to B-horror movies as well as the weakness of the shorter monster-based stories, but commended Umezu's ability to \\"create a chilling portrait of the human soul\\". Shaenon K. Garrity of Anime News Network enjoyed the range of monsters Umezu created and commended the longer stories. Otaku USAs Joseph Luster highly recommended it while calling it an \\"impeccable classic\\" based on Umezu's thoughtful storytelling and the horror elements. Greg McElhatton of Comic Book Resources liked how the manga broke from its horror anthology mold by involving the protagonist and deviating from the traditional sense of justice for the good. Connie C. of Comic Book Resources praised Umezu's ability to set a horror mood as well as his art, but felt mixed about his bizarre ideas which she thought were better suited to his shorter stories. Ain't It Cool News categorized the manga as an example of Japanese horror and called it \\"a chilling concoction of dark vignettes with the macabre, the grotesque and the absurd\\", despite Umezu's weaker storytelling at the beginning. Manga Bookshelf interpreted Umezu's goal with the manga as wanting to create a hallucinatory atmosphere devoid of logic and enjoyed the origin story of the cat eyed boy, while criticizing the story \\"The Band of One Hundred Monsters\\". IGN remarked that the humor in the manga set it apart from Umezu's more serious works such as The Drifting Classroom and that the longer stories were harder to read through. Comics Village also categorized the manga as Japanese horror and noted that the Viz release will appeal more to collectors. It also acknowledged the dated style of the artwork, but said that the story has \\"timeless qualities\\". Describing the type of horror in Cat Eyed Boy, Graphic Novel Reporter called it strange and creepy \\"...in the sense that the pictures are more likely to momentarily unsettle your stomach than keep you up at night.\\" It also complimented Umezu's imagery. ComicBooksBin enjoyed Umezu's approach to horror where he eschews logic, contrasting it with American horror. It also described his works as \\"...a gathering of grotesqueries and absurdities that almost defy imagination.\\" The Viz release of the manga was nominated for the 2009 Eisner Award in the category \\"Best U.S. Edition of International Material—Japan\\". In a 2008 reader poll of seinen manga by About.com, Cat Eyed Boy won 8th place.

As is the case with much of Kruger's art, You Are Not Yourself is often interpreted with a feminist analysis. Critics have discussed the gendered implications of the image, noting that the woman's shattered reflection suggests the existence of women in society is inherently fragmented. Women are held to many standards and forced to adopt conflicting roles only to become an amalgamation of other's expectations and assumptions; when a woman finally has a moment for self-reflection (or, as Kruger suggests, a chance to catch a glance in the mirror) she finds that she is \\"not herself\\".Rain&Cupcakes.; \\"Barbara Kruger's You Are Not Yourself.\\" WhatWhyWoman.

In 1991 interview, Kruger said: \\"I would venture to guess that many people heed their mirrors at least five times a day and that vigilance certainly can structure physical and psychic identity.\\" The use of pronouns in Kruger's work is often discussed as a potential source of meaning. In You Are Not Yourself, questions have been raised about the identity of the subject that Kruger hails: who is the \\"you\\" in question?

The formalization of intelligence sharing began with the Patriot Act, the Homeland Security Act and the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention and Act of 2004, which changed the overall structure of the US intelligence community, and formed the Department of Homeland Security108th Congress (December 17, 2004). \\"Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004\\" (PDF). U.S. Bill S. 2845. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) also became the umbrella organization for 15 intelligence agencies, between which the DHS would facilitate information sharing and collaboration.“Information Sharing,” Department of Homeland Security, accessed April 29, 2015. In addition, the formation of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence facilitated the sharing of intelligence between agencies and administrates several centers for improving intelligence work, including the Information Sharing Environment.  Types of Intelligence Sharing Networks  According to Joseph Pfeifer, there are 4 different type of networks which can be created to facilitate intelligence sharing: hierarchical, co-located liaisons, hub-and- spoke, and network fusion.Joseph Pfeifer, “Network Fusion: Information and Intelligence Sharing for a Networked World”, Homeland Security Affairs 8 (October 2012). Hierarchical linear intelligence systems involve singular, point to point connections between agencies, such as between a federal and state level organization, a state organization to a local entity, or bilateral agreements between states. These sharing mechanisms tend to be slow, but allow for increased security, as there is a tightly controlled exchange of intelligence. Co-located liaisons networks involve the creation of cooperative, multi-agency or multi-governmental locations which house representatives and analysts from a diverse set of agencies. In these organizations, there are typically dedicated buildings and organizations to facilitate such intelligence sharing. The most common example of co-located liaisons networks are fusion centers, which are formed from agencies or governments which have similar goals, and facilitate intelligence sharing in a common place. Hub-and-spoke network organization of intelligence sharing involves a common connection to intelligence and information, typically through secured networks to common servers and databases which all members can access. This method of intelligence sharing is employed by the Department of Homeland Security, which has NIPRNet and SIPRNet databases which connects its member agencies. Intellipedia is also a form of hub-and-spoke intelligence sharing.“Intellipedia Celebrates Third Anniversary with a Successful Challenge”, Central Intelligence Agency, accessed April 29, 2015. Network fusion involves a combination of these networks which best facilitates the intelligence sharing for the particular organizations which utilize it. It is this multilevel integration of sharing techniques which many find to be lacking most between intelligence organizations.  Fields of Shared Intelligence  Intelligence sharing occurs in every field that intelligence analysis is produced. The main fields of intelligence analysis are national security, law enforcement, and competitive. In each of these fields, intelligence is shared between agencies, bureaus, governments, or business partners in order to further their organizational goals. These goals can range from protecting people from violent threats, finding and apprehending criminals, or maintaining competitive advantage over other companies.  National Security  In the United States, National Security intelligence sharing occurs on many levels, ranging from field offices of IC organs to the White House. The intelligence sharing became a formalized policy after 9/11, when several Congressional acts reorganized the intelligence community and formalized intelligence sharing practices throughout. The Department of Homeland Security, Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and various fusion centers throughout the United States have been the vehicles for intelligence sharing. Their overall success in alleviating problems of intelligence sharing and effectiveness of operations has varied, but the need for improvements is acknowledged.Alfred Berkeley et al., Intelligence Information Sharing: Final Report and Recommendations (National Infrastructure Advisory Council, January 2012). In Europe, national security operations are carried out by various national agencies and the collective efforts of police forces through Europol and Interpol.Boşilcǎ, 2014, p. 7. Europol intelligence sharing became an imperative after 9/11 in much the same way of the US. In November 2001, a European Council meeting created the Counter Terrorist Task Force, which facilitated increased counter-terror efforts in EU member states and encouraged intelligence sharing between member states to prevent an attack similar to 9/11.Boşilcǎ, 2014, p. 10. Subsequent terrorist attacks in London and Madrid in 2004 and 2005 \\"gave impetus to EU initiatives\\", and the creation of the Counterterrorism Coordinator increased collective efforts for national security aims for member states.Archick, 2014. Since 2001, legislation and informal meetings between the US Secretary of State, Director of Homeland Security, and other ministerial members of the US intelligence community have met with their counterparts in EU ministries to discuss shared objectives and provide information on transport security and impeding terrorist travel.Archick, 2014, p. 2.  Law Enforcement  According to the US National Criminal Intelligence Sharing Plan (NCISP), the law enforcement community went through similar changes as the national security community in order to perform to new expectations in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. The NCISP \\"was designed by state, local, tribal, and federal law enforcement partners to provide a path forward in improving the collection and analysis of information to create valuable and actionable intelligence products.\\"“National Criminal Intelligence Sharing Plan” (Bureau of Justice Assistance: US Department of Justice, October 2013), pg V. Through the NCISP, there are 9 critical elements, 2 understandings of the systems which work in the intelligence sharing process, and 8 different types of participants. The 9 critical elements are leadership, partnerships, privacy, civil rights and civil liberties; policies, plans and procedures; intelligence process, training, security and safeguarding, technology and standards, and sustainability. The systems which are thought to be needed to achieve the Framework outlined are that the key to the success of information sharing systems is both use and interoperability and system interoperability is a complex problem. The main participants in intelligence sharing are criminal justice and law enforcement agencies below the federal level, federal law enforcement agencies, fusion centers, regional information sharing systems, High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas (HIDTAs), crime analysis centers, law enforcement professional organizations, and private sector and non-law enforcement organizations.“National Criminal Intelligence Sharing Plan”, (Bureau of Justice Assistance: US Department of Justice, October 2013).  Business  In the private intelligence field, businesses of various types, products and services will employ intelligence analysis to further their organizational goals, competitive advantage, and security. Typical businesses will keep much of their analytic products away from the public eye and especially from competitors. However, the realm of security, especially cyber security is a topic which many businesses have cooperated on in order to create a safer environment for their products, information, and customers. An example of this is the Retail Cyber Intelligence Sharing Center, which is a cooperative from over 30 (specifically) retail companies to share information and intelligence which pertains to the security of retail firms. Collectively, their work attempts to identify common threats and share best practices.“What Is R-CISC?”, accessed May 1, 2015.  References   Sources  * Archick , Kristin.

Main characters ; : :The protagonist, an ordinary high school student who has had the ability to see ghosts ever since he was a child. Because of this, he always felt different, but things changed after meeting Kagura. He started practicing kendo from a young age, being the son of a kendo instructor and utilizes his skills during missions. When fighting, he sometimes dons a pair of sunglasses. The story-line concerns his growth as a spirit-user, his main weapon being swords. He initially wields Michael #12, but after breaking it in a battle, is given the sword Michael Revolution in its place. He supports Kagura during her emotional lows and a bond develops between them. :Kensuke has the same sesshōseki that transformed Yomi into an evil spirit, embedded near his heart. According to Yomi, the sesshōseki itself wished to be placed there. The stone gives him partial memories of Yomi's past, as well as allowing his sword techniques to become radically more powerful. This stone was later removed when Imawano Setsuna forcefully tore it from his body in the Garden of Tamamo, fatally damaging his body in the process. He survived after Kagura defeated Setsuna and revived the Kyuubi, using its powers to restore his body from the brink of death. After firming his resolve to save Kagura from being controlled by the Kyuubi, he unleashes the true power of the Michael Revolution, the ability to cut through dimensions. :Kagura mentions that Kensuke has a unique presence which puts spirits at ease and even Byakuei feels more secure when Kensuke is near. ; : :Always smiling, Kagura is the heroine of the story. She is feisty and ambitious and can put up a good fight with her spiritual beast, the Ga-Rei Byakuei (nicknamed Shirō), an inugami who resembles a large white dragon. She controls Byakuei from the seal on her back and a long chain that connects her soul to his, so any damage Byakuei receives also damages her as well. Over time, she becomes stronger and more motivated because of the support that Kensuke gives her. She shows signs of having feelings for Kensuke, as she gets jealous when Shizuru and Kensuke are spotted alone together and is shocked when Kyouko tells her that she should go out with Kensuke if she's worried about him. Although she initially treats Shizuru as a rival, they become closer as events in the manga progress. :The anime shows a younger Kagura. Originally a shy, dutiful and sad young girl, her meeting with Yomi after her mother's death changed her life. She came to love Yomi, who treated her like a sister and was under great emotional stress when she found out that Yomi had turned against the Agency and all of humanity. ; : :Sister-figure of Kagura Tsuchimiya who turned evil because of the power of the sesshōseki. Also, she was the person who killed Kagura Tsuchimiya's father. She was killed by Kagura herself and has turned completely evil in her afterlife. She was extraordinarily talented when alive and slaughtered over 70 ministry agents by herself and defeated the head of the Tsuchimiya clan and his spirit beast, Byakuei. As an evil spirit, she becomes even more powerful. She tries to awaken a great demon sealed in Tokyo and seals a piece of the sesshōseki in Nimura Kensuke. For this, she incurs Kazuhiro's wrath and he takes away her own sesshōseki. :Yomi's past is prominently revealed in Ga-Rei: Zero, where she is shown to be more of a tragic heroine. She lost her parents at a young age to specters and was taken in by Isayama Naraku, then head of the Isayama family. Yomi grew to love and respect her foster-father and polished her skills to repay him for his kindness. Her efforts led to her inheritance of the prized Isayama heirloom, the sword Shishio, which held the spiritual beast Nue in it. Before Naraku's death, she was betrothed to Izuna Noriyuki and would have succeeded Naraku as the next Isayama head. However, Naraku's death at the hands of her cousin Mei, who was jealous of her good fortune, and the alteration of Naraku's will, resulted in her being stripped of her position in the family and therefore her entire inheritance. Yomi eventually found out the truth behind her father's death, revealed by Mei herself after the latter lured her out in order to kill her. Partly in self- defense, she killed Mei and avenged Naraku, but was ambushed by Mitogawa Kazuhiro, who wounded her so badly that she became hospitalized, her throat and most of the tendons in her body cut and unrepairable, unable to talk or move. This, in addition to the suspicion that she had murdered Mei, led to a series of events that caused her to succumb to Mitogawa's temptation to accept the sesshōseki. Though Yomi managed to retain some control over her mind, she had nonetheless fallen under the destructive influence of the stone, causing her to kill many members of the Agency. Ultimately, it was her love and desire to protect Kagura that caused her death at Kagura's hands, in a desperate wish that she could remove anything that would harm Kagura, including herself. ; :The main character in Ga-Rei: Tsuina no shou and appears in vol. 8 of the main series. She is a girl possessed by a curse that brings misfortune upon all those she falls in love with, if she even thinks about love it weakens those around her. Her ability is absorbing and purifying Spirit Energy. She fell in love with Mikado at first sight. :In Ga-Rei, she appears in Vol. 8 alongside of Mikado after one year of training overseas, presumably America, and is more confident, cheery, as well as skilled enough to absorb Miasma and discharge it into a spear to destroy a huge spirit. She then asks if Kensuke wants to rejoin the Counter-Measure department if it is rebuilt. She can also fight using a Robot-like suit, Vandam. She is an escort of the White Priestess, Kagura. The Agency ; : :An old friend of Kagura and ex-fiancée of Isayama Yomi. He uses Kudagitsune, or spirit pipe foxes, to spy on people and fight. He's very perverted and constantly tries to grope Kagura, with painful results. He is part of the information department. :Underneath his perverted and cheerfully helpless facade, Izuna is very powerful, able to fight on equal terms with Yomi. He is very knowledgeable on the subject of spirits and is skilled in hojutsu. He treats Kagura like a little sister and demonstrates concern for Kensuke. As Yomi's ex-fiance, he still had feelings for her. Behind all of his jokes and lecherous acts lies a man full of pity and self-loathing. After the Kyuubi arc, he tagged along with Imawano Shizuru to find her sister, Setsuna, but it is still unknown if they managed to locate her. He meets up with Kensuke and Kagura on the mountain and mistakes Izumi for Yomi. Izuna sees a lot of himself in Kensuke, which is why he wants to help Kensuke become stronger so that Kagura won't share the same fate as Yomi. It is revealed that he was blinded when he was poisoned by Mitogawa: now relying on his Kudagitsune to see. He is fatally wounded when he protects Yomi from a stab meant for her. As of chapter 48, Yomi had one of her protectors sacrifice the remaining power of his soul to save Noriyuki. He is seen later defending her from Mine, Sharing the same Evil spirit state Yomi is in. :Ga- Rei: Zero reveals how different Noriyuki was before the events of the manga. He was more of a playboy rather than a pervert, which angers his fiancée, Yomi, even though it is shown he does care about her. :Ga-Rei: Tsuina no shou reveals he saved Tsuina from an evil spirit and fought Mikado when he was planning to kill her to stop a spirit, claiming \\"Pretty girls are the country's treasure\\" and took her under his wing for training. He claims to be interested in her but given his nature he could be joking. ; : An agent of the Ministry and heir of her clan. She controls paper spirits, or shikigami. She gets along well with Kagura and often tries to get her and Kensuke together. She is very proud and went to fight Kidoumaru when he broke through her shikigami barriers. She ended up badly injured, but landed a critical blow on him. Usually, she is amiable and friendly. She is currently back in her parents' home in Kyoto. ; :Head of the Ministry as well as Kyouko Mine's grandmother. Her name is written as \\"Immortal Child\\". She may be old but she's not a person to mess with. In the events of Ga-Rei: Zero, she retired from her position and gave it to her other granddaughter, Ayame Jinguuji. After Yomi's attack on Ayame and Kiri, she left retirement to resume her former duties in Ayame's place. After the agency was disbanded she watches over Kagura. :A side-chapter featuring an 18-year-old Fujiko reveals that she took care of Kagura's grandmother, Ruri, before the formation of the Agency after WWII. ; : :An agent of the Ministry. He is very tall and muscular, as well as a powerful spirit-user. He uses guns to fight. Some of the more comical moments in the manga suggest that he may be homosexual (which is confirmed in the anime). He is an ex-soldier and was hired by a mercenary corporation until the Agency recruited him for his ability to sense spirits. After the department breaks up he disappears until chapter 38. In the anime, he was attracted to both Kensuke and Kazuki, which made them both uncomfortable. ; : :The Minister of Environment during the events of Ga-Rei: Zero and Fujiko Mine's other granddaughter. This character uses a wheelchair. She is nice and kind-hearted person with a relaxed air. While likable, she is very serious and earns her respect from her subordinates. Her personal assistant is Kiri Nikaidou who she affectionately calls \\"Kiri-chan\\". :She confronts Yomi and is later presumed to be dead, thus explaining why her grandmother, Mine Fujiko, returns to take her place as the head of the Ministry. In the last episode, she is seen alive and well in a hospital talking with Kiri. :It is hinted in episode 11 that Ayame may be married (thus suggesting that Jinguji may actually be her husband's family name). She is shown taking out a ring and a photograph of her before she became crippled, holding onto a man whose face is not shown. During her confrontation with Yomi, Ayame states that she once killed someone more important to her, hinting that her husband may have suffered corruption himself and was killed by her. :Ayame is also the only person who addresses the spiritual beasts (chiefly Ranguren) with nicknames that end in \\"-chan\\" (e.g. Ranguren as Ran-chan). The wheels on her wheelchair are inscribed to ward off spirits and it is shown she fights quite well, having been able to combat Yomi briefly. ; : :Ayame's personal assistant who helps her in her duties as minister. She has a serious work attitude and is very loyal to her boss, Ayame, as well as doesn't hesitate to scold others who disrespect her boss. She serves as the disciplinarian and the harsh voice of the Agency, in contrast to Ayame's friendly attitude. She is last seen in hospital talking with Ayame about Yomi's attack on HQ two years ago. She appears to have suffered mental damage due to her ordeal with Yomi, becoming childlike and addressing Ayame as \\"onee-chan\\" (elder sister). ; : :An agent of the Ministry. He is a young and sarcastic, annoying yet talented man around the same age as Noriyuki during the events of Ga-Rei: Zero. His weapons are two suitcases that open up at the bottom to reveal rows of muzzles, a kind of multi-row gatling gun, which he also uses as melee weapons. Later in the anime, Yomi tortures him to death with Noriyuki looking on, blaming himself for his (Noriyuki's) inability to kill her, explaining why Kazuki does not appear in the manga. ; : :Two large twin brothers who both have the same name, as they come from a culture that give twins the same name. Both brothers tend to finish each other's sentences. Because they look identical, it leads some of their teammates to confusion. In the manga, only one of the Nabu brothers appears (as a minor character with no lines) since the other brother was killed by Ranguren in Ga-Rei: Zero. The surviving Nabu was later killed during the Juugondō's attack on the Agency, after trying to protect Fujiko Mine from enemy fire. :An omake in volume 5 of the manga states that the Nabus are part of the San people from Southern Africa, further confirmed in their character page on the anime's official website. According to the omake, they lost their home and family to war. ; : :A large man from Australia who speaks bad Japanese with a foreign accent, frequently mixing in some English words. He is Iwahata's master and the creator of most of the Ministry of Environment's weapons from the practical guns and swords, to the often bizarre irons and boilers. Because of his appearance, he tends to be arrested by the police for indecent exposure. Despite being outlandish, he is greatly respected in the Agency for his skill, his creations famed for their ability to augment the user's spiritual output by several times. He possesses mid-tier spiritual abilities. ; :A main character in Ga-Rei: Tsuina no shou and appears in vol. 8 of the main series. An Exorcist for the Kyoto division of the Counter-measure department. He uses a shikigami called \\"Shuwarutsu\\" and he's skilled with Fuda to the point he can make a road in the sky. He takes his duties seriously and if killing someone to protect the greater good is needed he'll try to go through with it. :In Ga-Rei he appears once in Vol. 7 when Kagura is possessed and states that she must be killed. In Vol. 8 he appears with Tsuina and helps with the plan to purify Naraku. He also informs Kagura she was once a member. At the end of the series he proposes to Tsuina. Juugondō ; : A mysterious girl who first encounters Kensuke at school and then corners him in the bathroom. She demonstrates knowledge of the sesshōseki and threatens him with a gun, but then flirts with him. She reveals she has a sesshōseki of her own on a necklace. She is a lively and flirtatious girl but is emotionally closed- off and gets angry with herself when she gets closer to Kagura and Kensuke, as she is afraid of becoming too involved. She has been forced to kill from a young age and feels that there is no way out of the path set for her as heir to a criminal organization, explicitly shown after her elder sister, Setsuna, kills their father. This is something Kagura sympathizes with and is a key factor why she wants to help Shizuru. : There is a competition between her and Kagura to obtain the most sesshōseki, with Kensuke as the prize, but after the Kyuubi arc it is shown that Shizuru accepts the close bond Kagura and Kensuke share and bows out. She left Tokyo with Izuna to look for her own path and to find her sister, who disappeared from the hospital after the battle, but it is still unknown if they managed to locate her. She reappears with Izuna to rescue Kagura from the daidarabochi. : Shizuru is very competent with a gun and is shown to have excellent markmanship from when she silenced Kensuke by intentionally shooting at his forehead in an instant with her arms chained together and only causing a presumably shallow wound on the side of his head. Shizuru's hand-to-hand combat ability is equal to Kagura, as the two passed out simultaneously after defeating each other. She is shown to be ambidextrous, alternating a gun and her knife between her left and right hands respectively. ; : Shizuru's sister, who used to be very close with her. She was a genius of the Juugondō, which made the head of the Juugondō, her father, feel threatened. He tried to have her assassinated and used Shizuru as a hostage and so she disappeared, leaving Shizuru distraught but safe. She turns up when her father comes to Tokyo and kills him immediately with the other members in a coup, leaving her in control of the Juugondō. She later attacks the Agency and kills most of the agents, except for Kagura, Kensuke, Kyouko and Iwahata. : Setsuna is a skilled fighter, able to easily toy with Kensuke. She has the \\"Eye of Satori,\\" a telepathic ability that enables her to read minds. As a consequence, one of her eyes is remarkably different from the other. She has a spirit beast, a water-using ogre-like creature called Suiko (Water Tiger). She is ruthless and ambitious, willing to kill her own sister and subordinates. Her goal was to set the planet into eternal war. : During the fight in Tamamo's garden she killed Kensuke: however, after using the power of the Kyuubi, Kagura revived him. During the cataclysmic event when the Kyuubi came into being again, Setsuna lost an arm to protect Shizuru. She has disappeared from the hospital and since then Shizuru and Izuna have been tracking her down. Judgement Day This group is of characters trying to bring about the end of the planet; they nearly were all exorcist of the past. They sought to escort the Priestesses of Dark (Yomi) to Naraku. Their reason for being born in this era is to destroy it. ;Okama Zankurou : A cross- dressing samurai, his swordsmanship easily surpasses Kensuke's and he can completely hide his presence. He was an exorcist living during the Sengoku Jidai and took under his wing a boy who resembled Kensuke (and whom he claims to be Kensuke's previous incarnation), orphaned by a spectre attack. Unfortunately Okama fell under the spell of the Sesshouseki and was ultimately killed by his own student (whom Kensuke believes was his ancestor). ;Hattori Naizou : A masked and cloaked ninja who uses Kunai. He too was an exorcist who for unrevealed reasons abandoned his duty and became a nuke-nin. His design resembles Batman but with a top-knot on his head instead of the bat-ears. After Izuna Noriyuki was mortally wounded, Hattori offered to revive him by combining his essence with the former, which turned Noriyuki into a spectre and supposedly caused Hattori to disappear. ;God of the Land : A tanned old man, in the past he was known as the \\"God of the Land\\", he is the same as the Kyuubi and Tengu, a body born of a pure soul and ancient earth. He is completely neutral stating that as a \\"God\\" he is part of the \\"Decimation Plan\\", he gives advice to Kensuke to protects Kagura as her Escorts and awakens her memories. Antagonists ; :A spirit who helps Yomi. He is a swordsman in samurai attire and is very powerful. He is critically injured by Kyouko, but not before he almost kills her. Later, he is finished off by Kagura. ; : :A boy who used to belong to the Agency. He was enthralled by the sesshōseki, hoping to use the Kyuubi's powers to revive his mother, an exorcist who had been previously killed in action. When Lord Tamamo appeared to him in the Vatican's library, he willingly became one of her minions, sparking off the events in Ga-Rei: Zero and the first 7 volumes of the manga. He was the one who gave Yomi her sesshōseki and later took it away after he was displeased with Yomi giving one to Kensuke. He mentions a \\"Lord Tamamo\\" as his overlord, the former mistress of the Kyuubi before its sealing. After Yomi's demise, he is next seen participating in the Juugondō coup as Setsuna's underling. He removes Kagura and Kensuke's souls from their bodies and takes them to a spirit dimension he calls \\"Tamamo Garden\\", where they encounter Lady Tamamo. :He uses insect-related magic and seems to have powers related to the sesshōseki, such as being able to remove the souls of people who possess them. One of his eyes contains a sesshōseki. He was later killed by his resurrected mother, before Izuna could avenge Yomi. He wanted to expose the world they live in to the public, in a way he succeeded since the Kyuubi was seen around the planet. ;Lord Tamamo :The successor to the Kyuubi, she is the mastermind behind the sesshōseki-related incidents that have occurred and Kazuhiro's overlord. She used to be a demon-user who became an evil spirit of incredible power after death. She is first identified in chapter 19, when Kazuhiro removes Kagura's and Kensuke's souls and takes them to Tamamo Garden. When Kagura attacks him, Tamamo intervenes and reveals herself. Tamamo tells them to fight and search for the ten sesshōseki and that the one who collects them all will control the Kyuubi and be its true successor. :Lord Tamamo doesn't seem to have a discernible personality and appears quite inhuman. Spiritual Beasts ; : Kagura's beast, the titular Enchained Spirit Beast of the series. A dragon-like inugami with chains wrapped around it. The chains connect its soul to Kagura's and whenever Byakuei gets injured, Kagura will get hurt as well. He is one of the most powerful spirit beasts on earth. He was sealed in ancient times and has been passed down to the head of the Tsuchimiya family for generations. A lengthy ritual is required to seal Byakuei inside the recipient and Byakuei is never completely released, as he would break free of the seal and devour his owner. :In the fight against the immortal demon, Kagura tried to fully release Byakuei as she thought she was going to die. While she didn't, Byakuei's seal had been weakened and he started going out of control. Kagura initially wanted to kill him with the power of the Kyuubi, but has rejected that notion, as he is the only family she has. : In actuality, Byakuei is a wolf-like beast in his uncursed form and unlike his dragon and twin-head dragon forms, he has only one set of eyes, instead of two sets on each head. : After the incident with the Kyuubi and to the due loss of spirit energy he became a puppy version of himself. He gains a wolf like form while fighting Kirin but soon shrinks once it disappears. He carries a sword in his tail and Mikado believes his puppy form may be temporary. He can now transform at will. :Byakuei has the ability to absorb and convert another spiritual body into his own, an ability he demonstrated in the Garden of Tamamo against Setsuna and during the end of the Kyuubi arc, where he \\"ate\\" the Kyuubi's form. The full extent of this ability is shown in chapter 52, where he merged with the Tengu, which was released due to the weakening of his seal and took over the latter's body and powers. ; / : Yomi's spirit beast, below Shizuru's Kuroford on the Spirit Beast Rankings. Nue is the japanese equivalent term for chimera, a mythical beast having different animals as its body parts, like a lion for its head and snakes as tails. ; : Shizuru's spirit beast, the second strongest after Byakuei. Kuroford was originally sealed within an iron knife, but Shizuru drew him out. He utilises lighting-based attacks. After Shizuru lost her Sesshoseki to Setsuna, she could not unleash Kuroford. However, her willpower finally drew him out when attacked by the Juugondo in the haunted house. ; : A bake-danuki (raccoon-dog with spiritual powers) that can transform into a metal wall with a human face. It is introduced in chapter 16 of the manga, where it protected Kensuke from its mate, which was corrupted by a Sesshouseki, hoping to prevent her from killing anyone. Unfortunately, the extraction of its Sesshouseki resulted in the demise of its mate. Since then, Tanuki has stuck on to Kensuke, becoming a loyal sidekick of sorts to the latter. Tanuki's wall form is surprising sturdy, capable of withstanding even a missile and even laser emitting from the Kyuubi's defense system, QB9. It has a pouch and bell resembling that of Doraemon from the anime of the same name, with a similar facial structure. In later chapters, Tanuki dons a cape as well. It also encourages Kensuke to keep going after Kagura. In chapter 52, Kensuke calls Tanuki \\"Boko\\" to which it responded, suggesting that this might be the name that Kensuke has decided for it. ; : A peculiar black square- shaped creature kept in a cage with protruding spikes. It has the ability to turn people near it invisible and was first introduced in the 22nd chapter of the manga. While Kagura and the others were in hiding, it hid them from their pursuers and subsequently came to live with them during their exile. ;Kirin : A black-wolf from Naraku who acts as Byakuei's opposite, it emits a large amount of miasma and is extremely violent. It is revealed in chapter 52 to be the incarnation of the Kyuubi. In the final battle, Kirin burst through Byakuei and snapped the chain that bound Kagura's soul to Byakuei. If the chain were snapped, it is like tearing your soul in half. Kagura was later saved by Yomi when she used her remaining soul to seal the gap in Kagura's. Kirin was killed after one of the Black Priestess's guardians reached down its throat and tore out its black heart. ;Kyuubi (Nine-Tailed Fox) :A large monster the size of a city created when the ten pieces of the Seshouseki came together. The might of the Kyuubi was unamaginable and therefore could be seen by ordinary citizens. Anything that touches the Kyuubi would desintigrate into nothing with an exception of Kensuke, for he was infused with the Kyuubi's power to be resurrected. Upon its back lies the host, in this case, Kagura, a single individual with their heart infused with the Kyuubi's own feelings and therefore will show no facial emotions. The might of the creature also grants the host unlimited power to grant their hearts deepest wish no matter how impossible it was, in Kagura's case it was the resurrection of Yomi as Izumi. The host is surrounded by several masks, which are the guardians of the host firing energy out of their eyes at any threat. Their faces are indestructible and provide the perfect defense system. After Kensuke found himself on the Kyuubi's back twenty feet from Kagura, he was forced to engage the masks in combat with his Michael Revolution. His primary goal was to slice the cocoon which held Kagura but could not reach her due to the masks' lasers and blocks. In the end, he willed enough love into his sword and unlocked the power to slice through space extending his attack behind the masks and destroying the cocoon freeing Kagura and defeating the Kyuubi.

Structure The complete cDNA of PDPR, which contains 2885 base pairs, has an open reading frame of 2634 nucleotides encoding a putative presequence of 31 amino acid residues and a mature protein of 847. Characteristics of native PDPR include ability to decrease the sensitivity of the catalytic subunit to Mg2+, and reversal of this inhibitory effect by the polyamine spermine. A BLAST search of protein databases revealed that PDPr is distantly related to the mitochondrial flavoprotein dimethylglycine dehydrogenase, which functions in choline degradation.  Function  The mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate, linking glycolysis to the tricarboxylic acid cycle and fatty acid (FA) synthesis. Knowledge of the mechanisms that regulate PDC activity is important, because PDC inactivation is crucial for glucose conservation when glucose is scarce, whereas adequate PDC activity is required to allow both ATP and FA production from glucose. The mechanisms that control mammalian PDC activity include its phosphorylation (inactivation) by a family of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (PDKs 1-4) and its dephosphorylation (activation, reactivation) by the pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatases (PDPs 1 and 2). Clinical significance As PDPR is involved in the regulation of the central metabolic pathway, its participation in disease pathophysiology is likely, but there has been no published research on this thus far.

Dark media are a type of media outlined by American philosopher Eugene Thacker. Overview Discussed at length in the essay of the same name, Eugene Thacker writes that dark media are media that function too well. Thacker writes that, \\"dark media have, as their aim, the mediation of that which is unavailable or inaccessible to the senses, and thus that which we are normally \\"in the dark\\" about.\\" Typically in works of Horror, dark media are relatively commonplace media that show more of the world than is expected, with the dark medium showing what lies beyond the possibility of human sense. Dark media are significant in their ability to breach the, typically unbridgeable, gap between objects being mediated. With dark media, as shown in the J-Horror film Ring, dark media can create a point between the natural and the supernatural. In Ring, the dark medium of the VHS cassette makes it possible for antagonist Sadako Yamamura to cross the threshold of a tv, and subsequently kill those that have viewed the videotape.

These portraits depict people throughout Boston sitting in their living rooms, silently staring at the video camera as though it were a TV set. The portraits were meant to take fit into the space normally occupied by television commercials and as such to \\"interrupt the continuity of the undifferentiated flow of the television picture, giving viewers the possibility of pondering their own position facing the screen.\\"  Background  \\"Reverse Television\\" was first broadcast by WGBH-TV In an interview with Raymond Bellour, Bill Viola describes the compromises he had to negotiate through in the making and initial distribution of \\"Reverse Television.\\" Originally, Viola wanted the video portraits to be presented once every hour for a two-week period in one-minute segments with \\"no label, no title, or anything\\" attached to them. Viola claims that such a long duration as well as an absence of identifying information was crucial to the piece, since the work was meant to be a disruption of the normal viewing experience of television. WGBH-TV, wishing to keep broadcasting costs low, wanted to show the portraits in fifteen-second segments. The station also refused to broadcast the videos without a title, requesting that Viola include a full description of the piece at the beginning of each clip. In a confrontation with the station director, Viola ultimately agreed to show the clips in thirty second segments with text at the end of each clip stating his name and the date.

Babe specializes in woodcarving, and Carla focuses on textile arts; however, they work in a range of different artistic media. Carla has been recognized for her award-winning quilt work, which has been purchased by the National Museum of the American Indian, part of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. Background Carla, born 1961, is from Kahnawake near Montreal, Quebec. Babe, also born in 1961, grew up in Brooklyn, New York. He is a fourth generation Mohawk ironworker. Art career Both of the Hemlocks relay Mohawk culture and history through their artwork. Babe and Carla collaborate with each other to create political art works, as well. Babe carved and painted Walking in Two Worlds, and Carla created a quilt Tribute to Mohawk Ironworkers, which combined beadwork and appliquéd figured inspired by Charles Ebbets' iconic 1932 photograph of Mohawk men perched on a suspended I-beam. These pay homage to the late-19th century and 20th-century Mohawk construction workers, who helped build the highrises of New York City, including the Empire State Building. Her quilt, Haudenosaunee Passport, addresses the sovereignty of the Haudenosaunee Nations that predate Canada and the United States of America. Babe constructs wooden cradleboards that he carves and paints with his own artistic imagery. \\"He's really addressing stereotypes and identity issues,\\" says Bruce Hartman, director of the Nerman Museum of Contemporary Art. In 2013, the couple collaborated on a cradleboard focused on the aboriginal game of lacrosse, which won the 2013 Santa Fe Indian Market Best of Classification for Diverse Art Forms. Carla describes her work as meant to \\"engage conversations about issues that continue on her people's lands.\\" One of the issues that Carla confronts in her work includes fracking, hoping to draw attention to the long term effects it may have on the land in a way that fosters conversation. This is seen in her Turtle Island Unraveling, a cotton quilt with glass beads. Carla has also used treaty cloth in her works, the cloth dating back to the 1700s with the original language of the Treaty of Canandaigua. The use of this cloth is to draw attention to her people still upholding their end of the treaty, even when the United States government did not. The couple won Best of Classification for Diverse Art Forms at the Santa Fe Indian Market again in 2014. While the Hemlocks use political imagery in their artwork—for instance, questioning the long term effects of fracking—they also use aboriginal Iroquoian imagery. For instance, Carla uses images of turtles in her quilts.

After graduation she became a librarian at the Boston Public Library. Personal life Anita Hemmings was born June 8, 1872, in Boston to Dora Logan (maiden; 1856–1941) and Robert Williamson Hemmings, Sr. (1843–1908). Anita was an Episcopalian.  Husband  Anita married Andrew Love, MD (né Andrew Jackson Love; 1861–1948), on October 20, 1903, in Boston at Trinity Church. Their marriage license indicates their race as African American. About thirteen years earlier, in 1890, Love earned a medical degree from the Meharry Medical Department of Central Tennessee College in Nashville, an institution distinguished for, among other things, having the first medical school in the South for African Americans. Dr. Love did post-graduate studies at Harvard Medical School in the summer of 1905.  Children  1. Ellen Parker Love (1905–1995), a 1927 graduate of Vassar, who on June 6, 1934, in Manhattan, married Charles Beckinton Atkin (1906–1987). 2. Barbara Hope Love (1907–2007), who on June 9, 1930, in Manhattan, married William Adair Hurt (1907–1965). They later divorced. 3. Andrew Jackson Love, Jr. (1911–1982), who attended the Horace Mann School until around 1937, then transferred to the Mount Herman School in Northfield, Massachusetts – the sister school of his mother's alma mater – graduating around 1930 studied pre-med at the University of Wisconsin for two years (1930 and 1931), then went on to become an acclaimed jazz vocalist – notably as founder of the jazz trio, the Tune Twisters, which recorded, around 1939, a nationally popular jingle for Pepsi, an innovation in broadcast advertising and considered one of the first of its kind.  Siblings  1. Elizabeth \\"Libby\\" N. Hemings (born 1876) married Walter Gilbert Alexander, MD (1880–1953), on May 3, 1904, in Boston. They later divorced. 2. Frederick John Hemmings (né Frederic Henderson Hemmings; 1873–1956), earned a bachelor's degree chemistry from MIT in 1897. 3. Robert Williamson Hemmings, Jr. (born 1882), was an artist who studies in art included winning, in 1903, a bronze medal and scholarship from the Eric Pape School of Art for a sketch in black and white. He graduated June 26, 1899, from the Sherwin School's 26th class, a high school for African Americans in Roxbury.  Passing as white  Like some Black Americans at the time, Anita Hemmings and her husband passed as white for socioeconomic benefit. They did not inform their children of their racial heritage.  Secondary and higher education  left Anita Hemmings attended preparation school at Girls' High School in Boston and Northfield, where she had been roommates with Elizabeth Baker (maiden; 1868–1943), who, on September 23, 1896, married William Henry Lewis (1868–1949). Fulfilling a childhood dream, Anita went on to attend Vassar, and earned a bachelor of arts degree in 1897. She apparently attended as a white, something that was not known until her graduation, when a Boston newspaper – commenting on the graduation of an African American, Fred J. Hemmings, from MIT – stated that he had a sister at Vassar. Later, rumors circulated that she should have been valedictorian, but they were false. Some considered Anita the most attractive woman in her class; it was whispered that she had 'Indian blood' which accounted for her dark-hued complexion and straight black hair. She sang soprano in the glee club and was the featured soloist at the local churches in Poughkeepsie. In 1997, Vassar African-American studies students petitioned college president Frances D. Fergusson to recognize Anita Hemmings at that year's centennial celebration. Writing about it in Vassar Quarterly, Olivia Mancini, a local journalist, argued: \\"It brought [Hemmings’] graduation and presence to a level of honor that it should have had a hundred years ago.\\" Vassar has acknowledged Anita Hemmings as the first African American to graduate the college, but for almost all of her college career, she 'passed' as white. In popular culture In November 2017, it was announced that Zendaya will produce and star in a biopic of Hemmings' life titled A White Lie, based on the 2016 novel The Gilded Years by Karin Tanabe. Reese Witherspoon will also produce the project and Monica Beletsky will write the script. TriStar Pictures will distribute the film.

McCall's reduction of film to the essential properties of the medium resembles the work of other radical artists of his time, and has inspired various projects by artists such as Stan Douglas, Richard Serra, and Gordon Matta-Clark. Description The idea for Line Describing a Cone came to McCall on his voyage from London to New York, where he produced the film in 1973. Though he had already created a number of other 16mm films, Line allowed him to actualize his ideas on the relationship between viewer and film and the medium of film itself. The thirty-minute film begins with a single white dot projected onto a black surface. As time progresses, the dot begins to form a curved line, tracing the circumference of a circle until the end of the line reaches its starting point. Meanwhile, particles in the air reveal the path of light in the space between the projector and the wall, making visible a cone of light. If the artist's display specifications are met, this beam of light projects between thirty and fifty feet. The circle that is projected onto the surface sits approximately twelve inches above the ground, and its diameter spans seven to nine feet. The exhibition space lacks seating, inviting the viewer to interact with the ray of light beaming from the projector to the screen. When multiple spectators view the piece together, these encounters with the light, at once an interruption and component of the piece, become an interaction with other audience members. Exhibition Exhibition of Line has changed since its first displays. Following the rules of cinema, early screenings occurred at a specific time and place. Audiences had to arrive at the beginning of the film, typically hosted in New York lofts, and follow it through its conclusion. The dust and cigarette smoke that were common in these displays created the cone of light mentioned previously. When the film moved into art institutions such as the Whitney Museum of American Art, dust and smoke were replaced with fog machines. Moreover, these institutions played the film on a loop, allowing viewers to enter and leave the screening as they pleased. In addition to the changes that have already occurred in the display of Line over time, changes in technology and media rouse concern for the long-term fate of the piece. Apart from the change in materials that make the cone visible, from cigarette smoke to artificial fog, the impending obsolescence of 16mm film may require the piece to be transferred to a digital projector. Relation to film and sculpture Line Describing a Cone reflects McCall's interests in film and sculpture. Line addresses the medium of film by removing the narrative demands and addressing the specific properties of the medium itself such as projection, frames, and light. Moreover, by emphasizing the physical space between the projector and screen McCall calls attention to the sculptural dimensions of projection. In his artists's statement written to judges of the Fifth International Experimental Film Competition, McCall writes: McCall's manipulation of film has placed the piece within the art world as well as the world of avant-garde film.

It is part of Soochow University. It enjoyed the high reputation of \\"Chaoyang in the North, Soo Chow in the South\\" amongst Chinese law schools. It is dedicated to legal professional education, National law and Anglo-American law. This is the first comparative law school in Asia, and actively cultivates comparative law and the international law professionals. History Soochow University was founded in 1900 at Soo Chow (now Suzhou), mainland China. The Comparative Law School of the University, as the first modern law school in China, was later founded in 1915 in Shanghai Kunshan Road, starting with the law department. In 1927 it changed its name to the law school and started dedicating to education of professional law. Its curriculum adopts both national and common law, and it positively cultivates talents in comparative law and international law.JIA HUEI CHI The student of law department of Soochow University It is the only college in China that teaches Anglo-American law in a systematic way outside of Chinese law. One of the most famous law schools in China, the first comparative law school in Asia, is known as one of the best comparative law schools in the world, and it contributes to the training of talents in comparative law and international law. From the 1930s to the 1990s, the International Court of Justice had a total of six Chinese judges. Starting from Gu Weijun, and until 1997, Li Haopei, a judge of the United Nations International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, was a professor or graduate of Soochow Law School.Soochow University School of Law provided modern legal training prior to the middle of the 20th century in Asia. During the Chinese Civil War, the University was forced to limit its operation along with many other academic institutes. The School of Law was the first school to be reinstated after the University was officially relocated to Taiwan in 1954. In 1969, the Ministry of Education approved the restoration of a complete university system, which is a \\"private Soochow University\\" with a liberal arts, law, and business college. After the restoration in Taiwan, it continued its rigorous tradition and hired good professors. To cultivate modern legal professionals with an international outlook, it diversify its curriculum like exchange aboard, and lots of speeches of international law, and especially the whole year's lecture of international law and so on. The purpose of all these systems' establishment is to improve the quality of legal professional education.JIA HUEI CHI The student of law department of Soochow University In 1972 the School of Law moved into a new seven-story, air- conditioned building in downtown Taipei. These quarters are shared with the Graduate School of Economics and the School of Commerce. The building is strategically located near the Presidential Office and the judicial and legislative government complex.ROBERT E. TINDALL The International Lawyer Vol. 7, No. 3 (July 1973), p. 715 Published by: American Bar Association In 2015, the School of Law is holding a year-long centennial celebration, making it one of the oldest law schools in Taiwan.Official Website of Soochow University School of Law: http://www2.scu.edu.tw/law/Page/454  Department of law  .In 1954, the Soochow University School of Law was re-established in Taiwan with a Department of Law. Then in 1971, the Institute of Law was formally established, and the former UN Secretary of the Law, Liang Shuli, was appointed as the first director in the same year, the Faculty of Law of the University Department was divided into two groups, the Judicial Practice Group and the Comparative Law Group. In order to meet the needs of the society, the Department of Nighttime was also established to train young people in the same year. In the 81st academic year, the Judicial Implementation Team and the Comparative Law Group were abolished, and the original system was restored. The group system was changed. It was divided into the Public Law Group, the Civil and Commercial Law Group and the International Law Group in the third year of the university for students to take elective courses. , with the development of its diverse career. In 1992, the university department canceled the group course and responded to the non-group enrollment system.  Legacy of Pedagogy  When the Law School of Soochow University was established, the normal course was 3 hours, from 4:30 pm to 7:30 pm a day, Monday to Friday every week. On the one hand, for the sake of the convenience of the part-time layers and judges, on the other hand, students can do part-time jobs to support themselves during the day. In order to make sure the student have completely appreciated the main legal regime and basic theory in the world, and to cultivate a valuable and valued generation who can make significant contributions for China in this field, the school decided to set up the course of 3 main legal system: The Common Law, the Anglo-America Law and the Chinese law at the same time; meanwhile, students can compare differences among the three legal system and further learn to use different law systems in every case or policy. Through this way, students have more strengths in the internationalized world than any other law school's students, and can change their thinking modes easily.JIA HUEI CHI The student of law department of Soochow University During 1920 though 1927, most course were taught in English, only few of courses which related to Chinese law system were taught in Chinese. In the early age after law school established, what student trained was the traditional Chinese teaching method——reading and reciting, but after 1923, the school began to exercise authentic case teaching method, instead of previous method to coordinate with Anglo-American law. In order to fully promote the internationalization and diversification of legal research, the Continental Legal Data Center, the International Aviation and Space Law Data Center, and the Law of the Sea Data Center were established in 1994 and 1995. Legal academic and practical seminars have been held since 1992 on topics such as the comparison of legal systems across the Taiwan Straits, international financial law, international aviation and space law, civil and commercial financial and economic law, constitutional administrative law, criminal law, and customary laws of ethnic minorities. Jurisprudential journals and thesis collections, which contain Chinese and English legal academic papers that have passed the examination, have become a model for academic advancement. In response to the diversified development of society and the need for legal professionals, training is no longer limited to traditional legal education. The increasing international interaction and the diversity of social development has not only improved the legal system as well as the economic development of the country, nowadays, people need more than just law officers and lawyers, they also need all sorts of legal services.

Downtown Taipei Campus The Centennial Statue of Goddess “As the statue unveils and the exhibition of the school’s history kick-starts, it symbolizes the legacy that we inherit and will pass down,” the dean of Soochow University School of Law, Chia-Yin Huang said, “unlike the blindfolded goddess Justitia of Western culture, portrayed with a law book and a sword in her hands, the statue here holds two spheres and has Eastern facial traits. It not only demonstrates the distinctive features of Soochow, but also manifests justice and innovation. Meanwhile, it gifts the School of Law with the meaning of heritage, and we hope the next century to come would be much more blessed.” Jessup Moot Court Regional Winning Records The Jessup Moot Court Team of Soochow University School of Law has won ten regional championships and represented Taiwan in the International Round since 1999.

He has toured extensively, headlined international music festivals such as Decibel and Dekmantel, and played along the likes of techno pioneers Jeff Mills and Robert Hood. Early life Khutoretsky was born in 1976 in Saint Petersburg, Russia, then part of the Soviet Union. He moved to the United States at a young age, where he shared his time between New York City and Minneapolis. His parents divorced early on and he spent a good deal of his adolescence in and out of trouble, switching schools several times as a result. Khutoretsky credits eight years of piano lessons and synthesizer-based radio music as his earliest musical influences. After a teenage initiation into the Midwest rave scene, Khutoretsky began throwing his own underground parties at the age of 18. These parties would be where Khutoretsky first made his name in the scene, overseeing virtually every part of each event from promotion, to sound, to logistics. The parties quickly grew in size and popularity, often hosted in unofficial warehouse venues around the city. After a brief stint behind bars, Khutoretsky went on to open his own club in Minneapolis, run and operate hush studios, run and operate hush sound and make his first steps towards a more legitimate music career. Music career DVS1's first release came in 2009, on Ben Klock's influential Klockworks label. To date, he has 8 official vinyl releases and over two dozen remixing credits under his name. In an interview with DJ Times, he stated that he considers himself a DJ first and a producer second. DVS1 launched his own imprint, HUSH, in 2011. In 2013 he announced the launch of a new sub-label, Mistress Recordings, showcasing \\"house, techno and everything in between.\\" He described the purpose of the label as a way to release the \\"secret weapons\\" of his DJ bag. Regularly touring all over the world, DVS1 makes relatively frequent appearances at the legendary Berghain nightclub in Berlin, where he plays six to eight times a year. Between his time touring, working in the studio, and preparing sets, he continues to host parties in his home town of Minneapolis, which are held in underground venues and not publicly advertised. An avid vinyl collector, Khutoretsky has over 30,000 records in his personal collection.

Currently, e-diesel is created by an Audi research facility in partnership with a company named Sunfire. The fuel is created from carbon dioxide, water, and electricity with a process powered by renewable energy sources to create a liquid energy carrier called blue crude (in contrast to regular crude oil) which is then refined to generate e-diesel. E-diesel is considered to be a carbon-neutral fuel as it does not extract new carbon and the energy sources to drive the process are from carbon-neutral sources. As of April 2015, an Audi A8 driven by Federal Minister of Education and Research in Germany is using the e-diesel fuel. Catalytic conversions Sunfire, a clean technology company, operates a pilot plant in Dresden, Germany. The current process involves high-temperature electrolysis powered by electricity generated from renewable energy sources to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. The next two chemical processes to create a liquid energy carrier called blue crude are done at a temperature of and a pressure of . In a conversion step, hydrogen and carbon dioxide are used to create syngas with water as byproduct. The syngas, which contains carbon monoxide and hydrogen, reacts to generate the blue crude. * Sunfire power-to-liquids system: Base products are carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) :1st step: Electrolysis of Water (SOEC) −water is split into hydrogen and oxygen. :2nd step: Conversion Reactor (RWGSR) −hydrogen and carbon dioxide are inputs to the Conversion Reactor that outputs hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and water. :3rd step: F-T Reactor −hydrogen and carbon monoxide are inputs to the F-T Reactor that outputs paraffinic and olefinic hydrocarbons, ranging from methane to high molecular weight waxes. The final step is also known as Fischer–Tropsch process which was first developed in 1925 by German chemists Franz Fischer and Hans Tropsch. After the blue crude is produced, it can be refined to create e-diesel on site, saving the fuel and other infrastructure costs on crude transportation. As of April 2015, Sunfire has a capability to produce a limited amount of fuel at a day. There is a plan to increase the production to an industrial scale. Audi also partners with a company named Climeworks which manufactures Direct Air Capture technology. Climeworks technologies can absorb atmospheric carbon dioxide which is chemically captured at the surface of a sorbent until it becomes saturated. At that point, the sorbent is introduced with heat in a desorption cycle to drive out the high-purity carbon dioxide that can be used during the conversion step of the blue crude generation process. The atmospheric carbon dioxide capturing process has 90% of energy demand in the form of low- temperature heat and the rest from electrical energy for pumping and control. The combined plant of Climeworks and Sunfire in Dresden became operational in November 2014. A plant on Herøya in Norway, producing 10 million liters per year, is being considered, as from a fertilizer plant is readily available and electricity is relatively cheap in Norway. Properties As much as eighty percent of blue crude can be converted into e-diesel. The fuel contains no sulfur or aromatics, and has a high cetane number. These properties allow it to be blended with typical fossil diesel and used as a replacement fuel in automobiles with diesel engines. Oxygen by-product In future designs, the oxygen by-product may be combined with renewable natural gasThe first industrial PtG plant – Audi e-gas as driver for the energy turnaround in the oxidative coupling of methane to ethylene:Olah, G., Molnar, A. “Hydrocarbon Chemistry” John Wiley & Sons, New York, 2003. . : 2 + -> + 2 The reaction is exothermic (∆H = -280 kJ/mol) and occurs at high temperatures (750–950 ˚C). The yield of the desired products is reduced by non-selective reactions of methyl radicals with the reactor surface and oxygen, which produces carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide by-products. Another ethylene production initiative developed by the European Commission through the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development is the OCMOL process, which is the Oxidative Coupling of Methane (OCM) and simultaneous Reforming of Methane (RM) in a fully integrated reactor. Biocatalytic conversions Helioculture combines brackish water (or graywater), nutrients, photosynthetic organisms, carbon dioxide, and sunlight to create fuel. Audi also partnered with a now-defunct United States company, Joule, to develop Sunflow-D as e-diesel for Audi. Joule's planned plant in New Mexico involved the use of genetically modified microorganisms in bright sunlight to act as a catalyst for the conversion of carbon dioxide and salty water into hydrocarbons. The process could be modified for longer molecular chains to produce alkanes in order to create synthetic diesel. Joule was the first company to patent a modified organism that continuously secretes hydrocarbon fuel. The organism is a single-celled cyanobacterium, also known as blue-green algae, although it is technically not an algae. It produces the fuel using photosynthesis, the same process that multi-cellular green plants use, to make sugars and other materials from water, carbon dioxide, and sunlight. Similar initiatives There are other initiatives to create synthetic fuel from carbon dioxide and water, however they are not part of Audi's initiatives and the fuels are not called e-diesel.

Even during its heyday, a period when electricity was viewed with awe, some physicians called attention to the nature of the fraud but their efforts had little impact on the advertisement and sale. A letter to the editor of the Journal of the American Medical Association in 1897 by a physician named George N. Kreider states that \\"One of the most glaring frauds of this decade has been an appliance known as 'Electropoise,' advertised in Harper's Monthly and other leading publications\\" and promoted by a W.H.De Puy, editor of the New York Christian Advocate. N.C. Morse, a physician, tried investigating the instrument and wrote: I have had it sawed into sections and alas, like the goose that laid the golden egg of fable fame, there is nothing in the carcass! Another physician named Harding wrote in 1930 that the pricing of such devices helped in selling the remedy which may have had a placebo effect. The advertisement was clever in claiming that it enhanced the body's natural healing ability. The Electropoise, it claimed: Elsewhere it claimed: Skeptics pointed out the fraudulent logic used in claims and endorsements of its curative effect stating that it was dangerous use of post hoc ergo propter hoc as the logic. Sanche was careful in that he never claimed that his device would cure diseases like tuberculosis. Others like E.L. Moses, inventor of Oxypathor, would go to jail for 18 months in 1915 for making false curative claims. Oxytonor, a competitor The company was not without competition. A device called the Oxygenor was marketed by a rival and Sanche went to court. The court claimed that there was not enough evidence for the value of his invention and therefore that it could not be protected. Justice Shiras and the other judges declared that his theory of \\"diaduction\\" (a term he coined) was a mere pretense to allow him to obtain a patent. In Britain the Richardson Electro-Galvanic Belt of Ludgate Hill and the Magneto-Electric Battery Company were competing with Electropoise.

The stamens are arranged in bundles around the flower and there are 4 to 9 stamens per bundle. Flowering occurs throughout the year but mainly in summer. The fruit are woody capsules long. Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca gnidioides was first formally described in 1864 by Adolphe-Théodore Brongniart and Jean Antoine Arthur Gris in Annales des Sciences Naturelles, Botanique. The specific epithet (gnidiodes) is in reference to the similarity of this species to a plant in the genus Gnidia in the family Thymelaeaceae.

Gularte was diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. According to news reports, he did not realise he was going to die until minutes before his execution. Early life Rodrigo Gularte was born into a wealthy family in the southern Brazilian city of Foz do Iguaçu, Paraná. He was a keen surfer and relatives remember him as a tall, gentle, polite and kind young boy who slipped into depression, and became involved in drugs after his parents divorced when he was 13. His first treatment for drug addiction was at 16, when relatives say they had noticed signs of bipolarity. Other treatments would ensue, without success, and Gularte developed depression coupled with the use of drugs. His mother Clarisse tried to help him with work. Gularte gained, for example, a restaurant to administer, paid by his mother. He also had a son with autism, born when he was 21, Jimmy Gularte, with whom he had little contact. But his contact with drugs of all kinds, continued. During his 20s he travelled through Latin America with friends, drinking and taking various kinds of drugs. Sponsored by his mother, Rodrigo traveled through Latin America to the United States, Africa and Europe - consuming all kinds of drugs. \\"I thought these trips would do him well, he would wind down, get rid of bad influences,\\" says his mother Clarisse. The result was the opposite. Increasing his addiction, Rodrigo returned in 1994 to Curitiba. At 24, without work or study, nocturnal, Rodrigo was involved in a serious traffic accident after leaving a party, drunk and drugged. To avoid his arrest, Mrs. Clarisse admitted her son to rehab. After six months of detoxification, in 1996, Rodrigo tried to change his life. He became an entrepreneur, but two restaurants of his failed. In 1999, he passed the entrance exam to liberal arts at the Federal University of Santa Catarina. In the middle of the course, he dropped out. He then returned to travelling through Europe and Latin America bringing in various types of cannabis. In 2004, the opportunity arose to take the surfboards stuffed with cocaine to Indonesia. Arrest In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Bali was an international destination for young travellers attracted by a hippie vibe, surf culture and electronic dance music parties where cocaine and ecstasy were available at clubs, as was marijuana, supplied by Italian and Brazilian drug traffickers who often used young surfers as mules. Gularte lived in Florianópolis since 1999 when he was arrested in August 2004 with 6 kg of cocaine hidden in surfboards. The arrest, along with two other men who lived in the capital, took place at Jakarta airport in Indonesia. The trio was caught with eight boards stuffed with six kilos of cocaine, but Rodrigo took over sole responsibility for the transportation of narcotics. Conviction and imprisonment He was sentenced to death on 7 February 2005 by Indonesian government. During his early period in prison, Gularte shared a cell with fellow Brazilian convicted Marco Archer Moreira. After his conviction, Gularte tried to commit suicide in prison in 2006. His mental health was worsening and a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia with delusions and hallucinations was detected. There was a recommendation that he should be transferred to a psychiatric hospital. However Indonesian authorities did not allow his transfer since the experts were hired by the defense. The Gularte family tried, without success, to obtain clemency for him by saying doctors have diagnosed him as paranoid schizophrenic, which would normally allow him to be transferred to a psychiatric facility. The Brazilian government called for him to be spared the death penalty for humanitarian reasons. Execution Gularte was executed in Indonesia on 29 April 2015 at Nusa Kambangan, Central Java, Indonesia. He had been sentenced to death for drug trafficking, and the sentence was executed by a firing squad. According to his lawyer, Gularte did not know he would be shot. Roman Catholic priest Charlie Burrows was with Gularte minutes before the execution, at the request of the family and the condemned. Before his death Gularte received spiritual comfort and last rites of the Roman Catholic Church. Gularte's body was taken to the Saint Carolus Hospital, in Jakarta. Gularte's photo, and a cross with his name and the date of his birth and his death were beside the coffin. His body was transported to Brazil, where he was buried at the request of Gularte. A day after Gularte's death, a Catholic Mass was celebrated in honour of him. Rodrigo Gularte's body was concealed and buried in Curitiba, Paraná, on 3 May 2015, after a Mass celebrated in honour of him. Reactions According to the Brazilian government, Gularte's death is a \\"serious event\\" in relations between Brazil and Indonesia. The note says that Brazil will work in international human rights bodies for the abolition of the death penalty. A government's statement against death penalty applied by Indonesia was read by the Secretary General of Foreign Affairs, Sérgio Danese, during an interview given at Itamaraty. The Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon expressed \\"deep regret\\" for the execution of eight convicted of drug trafficking in Indonesia, including Rodrigo Gularte. Ki-moon expressed deep regret at the executions carried out in Indonesia, despite numerous requests in the country and internationally to interrupt it.

(initialism for \\"playable teaser\\") is a first-person psychological horror video game developed by Kojima Productions, under the pseudonym \\"7780s Studio\\", and published by Konami. The game was directed and designed by Hideo Kojima, in collaboration with film director Guillermo del Toro. Released for the PlayStation 4 on 12 August 2014 as a free download on the PlayStation Network, P.T. served primarily as an interactive teaser for the game Silent Hills, a cancelled installment in the Silent Hill series. After the cancellation, Konami removed P.T. from the PlayStation Store and eliminated the opportunity to re-install the game, a decision that later spawned criticism, fan efforts to allow P.T. to be re-downloaded, and fan remakes of the game. P.T. received critical acclaim for its direction, visuals, story complexity, and its supernatural horror tension build, while its puzzles drew mixed responses. Gameplay Unlike in the Silent Hill games, the player character has no means of defense against the hostile ghost Lisa (pictured). Her design has drawn comparisons to the yūrei and ubume in Japanese folklore. Unlike the third-person perspective in Silent Hill games, P.T. uses a first- person perspective, which centers on an unknown protagonist, controlled by the player, who awakens in a haunted suburban house and experiences supernatural occurrences. Available areas to explore in the home consist of an L-shaped corridor with two rooms adjacent to it: a bathroom, and a staircase which leads to the room in which the player starts a loop, or a continuous reincarnation of the corridor. The only actions the player can use are walking and zooming. To progress, the player must investigate frightening events and solve cryptic puzzles. Each time a loop is successfully completed, changes appear in the corridor. Additionally, the player encounters a hostile ghost named Lisa. If she catches the protagonist, the player has a random chance of triggering a startling jump scare when turning the camera horizontally and is sent back to the beginning of the current loop. After the player solves the final puzzle, a cryptic and unrevealed puzzle that allows the player to escape, a trailer reveals that P.T. is a \\"playable teaser\\" for a new game in the Silent Hill series, called Silent Hills, directed by Hideo Kojima and Guillermo del Toro, with the protagonist portrayed by Norman Reedus. Plot P.T. centers on an unnamed protagonist who awakens in a concrete-lined room and opens a door to a haunted corridor, in which he can only walk through a hallway which continuously loops and redecorates itself. The first time he passes, a radio reports on a familicide, which was committed by the father and later mentions two other cases exactly like it. Later on, the protagonist encounters a hostile and unstable female apparition, presumably named Lisa. Upon entering the bathroom and being locked inside, he obtains a flashlight and finds a creature resembling an underdeveloped fetus crying in the sink. He soon gets out but finds out that the apparition is watching him. While it is possible to avoid the ghost completely, if the protagonist is attacked by the ghost he reawakens in the first room of the game, beginning the loop again. In this room there is a bloody moving paper bag that speaks to him, telling him of a disturbing experience and stating the same quote seen at the start of the game: \\"Watch out. The gap in the door... it's a separate reality. The only me is me. Are you sure the only you is you?\\" The next few loops feature a refrigerator hanging from the ceiling, leaking blood. The muffled sound of a hysterically crying baby can be heard from the refrigerator, which shakes violently. After the player completes a puzzle and enters the next loop, the refrigerator is absent and the radio issues a Swedish message referencing the 1938 radio drama The War of the Worlds. In the next loop, the lamps turn completely red, the player's vision blurs, the protagonist moves abnormally quickly, and the door leading to the staircase at the other end of the corridor is replaced by infinite repetitions of the same loop. Eventually, the protagonist discovers a hole in the wall and looks through it to hear a woman being stabbed to death in the bathroom, while a voice on the radio rants about societal instability. After the sounds of the radio and the killing stop, the bathroom door opens by itself and the player enters upon the fetus-like creature telling the protagonist that ten months earlier, an unspecified person lost his job and turned to alcoholism. His wife then worked as a part- time cashier to financially support the family, but the manager was sexually attracted to her. The corridor then corrects itself and the protagonist eventually hears a voice uttering \\"204863\\" repeatedly. The player's perspective distorts, and the game displays a false crash message. When the game is restarted, the protagonist awakens in the concrete-lined room and continues the next and final loop with only the flashlight as a light source. He discovers the torn pieces of a photograph scattered throughout the hall and reassembles it in its frame. After the picture is completed and a set of tasks is done, a telephone rings; the protagonist answers the phone to hear the words, \\"You've been chosen.\\" The protagonist hears a door unlock and leaves the building. In the subsequent cutscene, a voice remarks about having lived a life of regularity until his father killed him and his family without any creativity; he then states his intention to return with his \\"new toys\\". The protagonist steps out into the streets of a deserted city and is revealed to be portrayed by Norman Reedus. The credits then reveal the nature of the Playable Teaser. Development Hideo Kojima, the designer of P.T. Kojima Productions used their game engine, the Fox Engine, to develop P.T. Hideo Kojima's intention when creating P.T. was to scare people in a unique way, as well as to deliver an interactive teaser experience instead of releasing trailers and screenshots of Silent Hills. P.T. was designed to take players at least a week to complete, and Kojima intended the puzzles to be very enigmatic and difficult. Despite this, a few gamers reportedly finished the game within hours after the release, surprising him. Kojima also intended for P.T. to be a mystery in order to make it a more frightening experience. There is little, cryptic, information given in the game on events that take place, and there are few clues as to how to solve the puzzles. He chose the corridor as the setting as opposed to \\"a ruin\\" because he wanted the teaser to emotionally affect the player regardless of \\"cultural background\\". Kojima elaborated that P.T. and Silent Hills have no canonical and direct relation, and that Silent Hills would have been enhanced by elements that were never in P.T. He based his concept of P.T. on horror films and other media that he found frightening. When creating the game, Kojima refrained from using graphic violence to build up suspense, as he felt that too many horror games rely on the trope. He wanted to elicit a more \\"genuine, thoughtful and permeating\\" type of fear. A user was able to hack the in-game camera of P.T. to show that for most of the game, the model of Lisa is tethered directly behind the player away from the direction the player is looking. This enabled the game to show fleeting shadows of Lisa and some of the sound effects associated with her that the player experiences throughout the game. The same user discovered that the player-character is modeled after Reedus throughout all parts of the game and not just at the ending, and that much of the world outside of the interior rooms is an incomplete but detailed map of Silent Hill. Release P.T. was originally announced at Gamescom 2014 as a demo for an eponymous mystery horror video game. It was released on 12 August 2014, on the PlayStation Network. Instead of formally announcing a new Silent Hill game, director Hideo Kojima decided to release P.T. as a game demo from a nonexistent gaming studio called 7780s Studio. In September 2014, Sony announced during its pre-Tokyo Game Show press conference that P.T. had been downloaded over a million times. Critical reception Erik Kain of Forbes enjoyed the game for its anxiety- inducing horror, and wrote that it succeeded as marketing for the upcoming Silent Hills. David Houghton of GamesRadar praised it for its immersive, well- executed horror and for how the game's difficulty created online discourse: \\"By spreading out into the real world, by forcing solutions by way of hearsay, internet whispers, and desperate, rumoured logic, it has become its own urban myth.\\" Eurogamers Jeffrey Matulef wrote that, through its emphasis on \\"sound effects, visual design, choreography, and difficult to decipher enemy placements\\" over traditional progress, the game became immersive and terrifying. However, the puzzles in P.T. received criticism. Patrick Klepek panned the puzzles, describing them as an \\"exercise in frustration\\". Matthew Reynolds of Digital Spy wrote that the final puzzle was a \\"source of frustration\\" which lacked a clear solution. In contrast, Matulaf stated that, while the puzzles ranged in cleverness and difficulty, they added to the horror of the game by being emotionally \\"uncomfortable\\". P.T. was also placed on some \\"best-of\\" lists in 2014. GameSpot awarded it the \\"Game of the Month\\" for August 2014. IGN's Marty Sliva chose P.T. as an honorable mention on his list of the best video game trailers of the year, describing it as \\"one of the most interesting, gorgeous, and terrifying\\" games he played that year. Another reviewer for IGN, Lucy O'Brien, described the game as \\"the most genuinely frightening interactive experience in recent years\\", making it her choice for game of the year. Giant Bomb gave the Best Horror Game of the year award to P.T., saying that \\"P.T. reminded us what happens when unlimited resources are thrown at a horror experience.\\" P.T. won \\"Scariest Game\\" at Bloody Disgustings FEAR Awards. The game also won Innovation in Game Technology at the 2014 National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers (NAVGTR) awards. Polygon ranked it as the tenth best game of the year, and Slant Magazines staff ranked it as the eighth best video game of the year. Patrick Klepek of Kotaku originally listed the game as number one on a list of the ten best horror games on 13 February 2015, describing it as \\"the new king of horror.\\" The game was replaced by Amnesia: The Dark Descent as number one when Silent Hills was cancelled and P.T. removed. In 2018, The AV Club ranked P.T. as the greatest horror game of all time in a list of 35. In 2017, GamesRadar ranked P.T. the fourth best horror game of all time out of 20. Themes and analysis Danielle Riendeau from Polygon compared P.T.s fetus in the sink (pictured) to the deformed baby in David Lynch's film Eraserhead (1977). Reviewers have identified several themes in P.T. According to Eurogamers Jeffrey Matulef, the game's main theme is \\"cyclical mental anguish,\\" supported by the obscure and confusing nature of the puzzles. Danielle Riendeau of Polygon wrote that P.T. uses two primary themes from the Silent Hill series; \\"a sense of family trauma and domestic violence and the duality of the 'real world' and the nightmare world.\\" She suggested that P.T. and Eraserhead shared thematic content, writing that both included a crying, deformed infant and that the film's protagonist journeyed from reality into a terrifying world. P.T.s ceaselessly looping hallway has been a source of critical discussion. Rob Crossley of GameSpot wrote that it induced \\"mild claustrophobia\\" and \\"a familiarity with your surroundings.\\" He remarked that while the length of the first part of the corridor worked to create tension, the design of the second part intentionally prevented the player from being able to keep everything in view, causing the player to feel vulnerable. David Houghton of GamesRadar described the looping corridor as \\"the conduit for everything that it builds,\\" along with saying that \\"it fills that structure with an unbroken feedback loop of 'horror' ... every time you leave is a monumental relief, and every simultaneous instance of returning is a moment of primal foreboding at how things might, and almost certainly will, escalate, compounded by the knowledge of the seemingly countless iterations before.\\" Houghton felt that the game understood how to evoke horror by working \\"within the realm of psychology.\\" Polygon quoted a game player who said that \\"P.T.s greatest asset is its looping hallway,\\" elaborating that it not only invokes fear, but also \\"curiosity, or a desire to know what will happen next.\\" Matulef said that the claustrophobic and repetitive environment displayed in the game can hypnotize the player into a sense of vulnerability. The majority of what is said and depicted in the game is open to interpretation, leading fans to develop and discuss theories about the nature of the events that occur in the game. Let's Players Voidburger and Bob from the video-game related podcast The Grate Debate opined that the open- ended nature of the game is one of its greatest aspects. They also said that there may be something in the game that has not been discovered yet. They noted the changing colors of the flashlight's beam in the final loop as something they still had not figured out, and they felt that the game hinted that the radio may be the main culprit behind the father's murderous actions. The podcast's YouTube channel released a video in August 2019, claiming that the whole game was a metaphor for Kojima's discontent with Konami and how he was allegedly treated by them, drawing allusions to key moments leading up to his leaving of the company in October 2015. The game also contains a Swedish line in the radio describing a radio drama from 1938 being true, which gamers suggested may be a nod to Orson Welles's radio adaptation of The War of the Worlds. This possible reference to alien invasions was noted as a continuation of a Silent Hill tradition of having secret endings that included aliens. Another theory commonly discussed is deciphering the identity of the player character. The fetus talking to the player character about his remembering moments \\"ten months back\\" seems to imply that he is the father who killed Lisa and the kids, although there is speculation that the player character may be the protagonist that was to be in Silent Hills, as shown in the trailer following the ending of P.T. Media description Journalists have expressed confusion about whether the game should be described as a teaser, video game, or demo. Despite ongoing debate, the game won awards for best trailer while also winning game of the month and best horror game of the year awards. While naming P.T. as an honorable mention for best trailer, Marty Sliva from IGN felt that P.T. was more of an \\"interactive experimental film/puzzle game\\". \\"Demo\\" has been one of the more common descriptions, though GameSpot was reluctant to categorize it as such. Despite it being commonly called a demo of Silent Hills, there is no evidence that it was going to be a part of Silent Hills aside from the reveal of the trailer and title after the end of the game. Hideo Kojima himself explained that it was not a demo of Silent Hills and described it as a \\"teaser\\" in a tweet. Christopher Grant from Polygon likened P.T. to Pixar's animated shorts shown before its full-length animated feature films.  Legacy  P.T. has also been alluded to in other video games. Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, another game directed by Kojima, includes several direct references to P.T., such as radio dialogue and sound used in the teaser. Additionally, the first-person survival-horror video game Allison Road was heavily inspired by P.T. Allison Road is to take place in a haunted townhouse in the United Kingdom and feature a male protagonist who attempts to unravel the mystery behind his missing family over five nights. In the demo, some wall graffiti directly alludes to P.T. by repeating a statement made in the game. The Park, a spin-off game from The Secret World, has a sequence inspired by P.T., and the horror games Layers of Fear and Visage were heavily inspired by P.T. as well. In February 2016, the YouTube channel known collectively as \\"Oddest of the Odd\\" released a short film titled \\"Silent Hills P.T. in real life\\". The film draws heavily from its source material, as an unseen protagonist explores a two-story hallway loop in the first-person camera perspective. The short film was featured by IGN describing it as \\"incredible\\" while GameRant's Alexander Pan described the video as being \\"complete with the demo's much-touted disturbing content and eerie atmosphere.\\" Resident Evil 7: Biohazard was also compared with P.T. during its announcement at E3 2016 thanks in part to the Beginning Hour Demo, its first- person perspective, and its photo-realistic graphics. Jordan Amaro, the level designer of Silent Hills, was responsible for the creation of Resident Evil 7s design and setting, although he has denied that his work on Resident Evil 7 was influenced by P.T., claiming that he \\"wasn’t part of the core team of P.T.\\" and that \\"Silent Hills would have been quite different from Resident Evil 7 anyway\\". Removal and remakes Following news of the cancellation of Silent Hills, it was announced that P.T. would be removed from the PlayStation Network on 29 April 2015. Originally, it was reported that the demo could be re-downloaded, but in May 2015 it was no longer re-downloadable from the PlayStation Store. Cancellation of the game led to criticism of Konami. Patrick Klepek from Kotaku stated \\"It's fine that Konami doesn't want to make Silent Hills\\" but that the deletion of P.T. was wrong since the demo had become part of gaming culture. Nick Robinson of Polygon described Konami's removal as the \\"most irresponsible, cowardly decision possible,\\" but that the subsequent unavailability had also made the demo \\"one of the coolest, most fascinating games in the history of our medium.\\" After the cancellation, PlayStation 4 consoles with P.T. installed were listed on eBay for over $1000; eBay later pulled the auctions down. The incident has been compared to the mass selling of iPhones containing Flappy Bird after that game's removal from the iOS App Store. Guillermo del Toro, the intended future director of Silent Hills, commented on P.T.s popularity, speculating that there were people who still have a passion for the Silent Hill series. On 24 October 2014, a user named Spawn N8NE remade the game both in and using Project Spark, while cleverly titled R.T., where users can download and play the game for free while using the game, project spark. the trailer features actor Nicolas Cage playing the game and becomes terrified by it. however, on August 12, 2016, the game was no longer available for download after Microsoft announced that its online services would be shut down, and Project Spark itself would no longer be available digitally.

The show aired on Japanese television on October 31, 2004, in conjunction with the 17th anniversary of the death of Yujiro Ishihara. It carries on the Seibu Keisatsu series, which was broadcast from 1979 to 1984. It portrays the efforts of the in combating terrorism. (Kogure's death means Daimon replaces him as with Hatomura assuming the position of ) Synopsis Kazuma Tachibana, a Tokyo Police detective on liaison with the NYPD, and his partner, New York City Police detective Bob Anderson, chase a criminal named Chan in New York City. Upon his arrest, they learn that one of Chan's associates is a career criminal named Masaomi Niimi, wanted by Interpol on charges of passport fraud. They arrest Niimi, but in the process Anderson is fatally wounded and dies in Kazuma's arms. Overwhelmed by guilt and determined to avenge the loss of his partner, Kazuma joins his superior, Eiji 'Hato' Hatomura to escort Niimi back to Tokyo where he will stand trial. Meanwhile, back in Tokyo, Section Chief Keisuke Daimon arrives at the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Western Division headquarters. Here Daimon receives news of Niimi's arrest. Bomb squad officer Naomi Kusaka is introduced. They are briefed by Chief Inspector Kengo Kusaka, supervisor of the counter-terrorism division. He tells them that a criminal known as \\"Makoto Suzuki\\" has been traveling to Chechnya regularly to purchase weapons from the Chechen Mafia, and was an associate of Niimi. Later that night, Daimon and Kengo go to a bar run by Naomi Kusaka's mother, Aiko, who plays the piano there. In the pub are several tagged bottles, one labeled 'Kogure-sama' (木暮 様). Daimon drinks a toast to Kogure, his late friend and superior. Meanwhile, Chan is killed by a mysterious Japanese man. After escorting Niimii to headquarters, Kazuma is introduced to Section Chief Daimon and later, the officers interrogate Masaomi about several murders, for which he is wanted in addition to his passport fraud. While on the roof, Kazuma and Hato chat regarding what happened in New York City. Kengo, Daimon, Hatomura and the other detectives are in the meeting room, where Kengo has brought information regarding Makoto Suzuki: he is currently in Japan and may be planning a terrorist attack. Acting on this tip the Hatomura Force (鳩村軍団) head for Miyazaki Prefecture, just as several officials, escorted by Kengo, arrive in Miyazaki for a counter-terror conference. Their arrival is watched by the same man who had killed Masaomi's associate in New York plus two of his cronies. The three are caught on airport security cameras. Hatomura now fears the worst. The next morning his fears are confirmed when a terrorist group called 'Black Hawk' takes the investigators (including Kusaka) hostage and brings them into one of the hotel's dining rooms, in which one of the Japanese counter-terror officials is fatally shot. After the terrorists close the blinds to darken the room, their leader, Makoto Suzuki, arrives. Eiji heads to Daimon's office and confirms the attack. In Miyazaki, Suzuki contacts the police with his only condition: release Niimii Masaomi or the hostages will be executed. Knowing the threat, the higher-ups reject the demand and proceed with plans to try to end the siege. An officer who tries to photograph the gunmen on a balcony of the hotel gets shot while Hatomura and Naomi arrive to assess the situation to plan a rescue for the hostages. They conclude that a direct assault is too risky, while a stealth operation is impossible with the tight security. While covering up the dead, Japanese official Kengo silently takes his cell phone just as Suzuki activates a bomb that will go off in 8 hours. Kengo is able to get hints to the bomb's location when he sees the wording 'NS-990VR' on the back of a computer screen for the device's timer, while the team goes attempts to identify other gang associates. A mechanic at the local Autobacs branch finds a paper with writing on it in the back seat of a vehicle he was cleaning. It turns out to belong to Toshio Hiura, a computer hacker who works for the gang. After confronting Hiura in an Internet cafe, he jumps to his death, the team learns that NS-990VR is the number for a tour bus that is currently in the city. They evacuate the bus but without enough time for Naomi to defuse it. Kazuma drives the empty bus, escorted by police units and a fire truck into a field with piles of sand. He jumps out a second before the bomb detonates. Back in interrogation, Niimi reveals the existence of a second bomb planted by the group. He demands to be released if he discloses its location. This time they comply and show him to the gang, offering Kengo as proof of life. There they learn that Niimii and Suzuki are brothers whose parents were taken by foreign soldiers and executed. Meanwhile, Kengo tries to get the location of the second bomb using the technique that helped determine the location of the first explosive device. He gets caught with the dead official's cell phone. While trying to flee, he is shot and killed by Makoto, much to the horror of the investigators. They decide to make the exchange in the lobby: Niimii for the other hostages while the other members of the Hatomura Force get into position to ambush the terrorists. After a brief brotherly hug Suzuki opens fire on Hato and a gun battle erupts, with a number of terrorists killed and most of the investigators wounded. The surviving terrorists escape in SUVs, triggering car chases that destroy several police cars. Meanwhile, Naomi finds the body of her late father and superior and cries over it, but his death is not in vain as he was able to write on his hand the words Marine Express, a ferry where the second bomb is planted. While the remaining members go after Suzuki, Niimii and their cronies, Naomi locates the bomb. She is forced to remove her gear due to a laser scanner system that will trigger the bomb. After following them to a quarry, Hatomura fatally shoots Nasaomi just as Suzuki gets him onto a helicopter. Wearing only her latex suit Naomi crawls through the lasers and stops the bomb by jamming the trigger with her late father's pen. Back at the quarry, the police begin the assault on the Black Hawk headquarters, losing several police cars getting to rocket launcher-wielding terrorists. Under cover from the riot squad, they enter the HQ, where they subdue or kill the terrorists. Inside the building however, Suzuki holds Kazuma at gunpoint, forcing Hato to disarm. However, Tachibana provides a distraction enabling him to escape and drawing Makoto and Hatomura into a fist fight until a pile of gravel nearly lands on them both. Suzuki is able to get the carbine, forcing Eiji to shoot him. However, while he calls out for Tachibana, the criminal mastermind is reaching for his Walther P99. This is however spotted by Kazuma and he shoots the ringleader. In spite of his injuries, Suzuki triggers the a bomb in the complex. The bomb detonates just as the Hatomura Force escapes, destroying HQ.

Influenced by social ecology, libertarian municipalism, Middle Eastern history, nationalism and general state theory, Öcalan presents the concept as a political solution to Kurdish nationalist aspirations, as well as other fundamental problems in countries in the region deeply rooted in class society, and as a route to freedom and democratization for people around the world. Although the liberation struggle of the PKK was originally guided by the prospect of creating a Kurdish nation state on a Marxist-Leninist basis, Öcalan became disillusioned with the nation-state model and state socialism. Influenced by ideas from Western thinkers such as the libertarian anarchist and social ecologist Murray Bookchin, Öcalan reformulated the political objectives of the Kurdish liberation movement, abandoning the old statist and centralizing socialist project for a radical and renewed proposal for democratic-libertarian socialism that no longer aims at building an independent state separate from Turkey, but at establishing an autonomous, democratic and decentralized entity based on the ideas of democratic confederalism. Rejecting both the authoritarianism and bureaucracism of state socialism and the predation of capitalism, seen by Öcalan as most responsible for the economic inequalities, sexism and environmental destruction in the world, democratic confederalism defends a \\"type of organization or administration can be called non-state political administration or stateless democracy\\", which would provide the framework for the autonomous organization of \\"every community, confessional group, gender specific collective and / or minority ethnic group, among other\\". It is a model of participatory democracy built on the self-government of local communities and the organization of open councils, town councils, local parliaments, and larger congresses, where citizens are the agents of self-government, allowing individuals and communities to exercise a real influence over their common environment and activities. Inspired by the struggle of women in the PKK, democratic confederalism has feminism as one of its central pillars. Seeing patriarchy as \\"an ideological product of the national state and power\\" no less dangerous than capitalism, Öcalan advocates a new vision of society in order to dismantle the institutional and psychological relations of power currently established in capitalist societies and to ensure that women have a vital and equal role to that of men at all levels of organization and decision-making. Other key principles of democratic confederalism are environmentalism, multiculturalism (religious, political, ethnic and cultural), individual freedoms (such as those of expression, choice and information), self-defense, and a sharing economy where control of economic resources does not belong to the state, but to society. Although it presents itself as a model opposed to the nation-state, democratic confederalism admits the possibility, under specific circumstances, of peaceful coexistence between both, as long as there is no intervention by the state in the central issues of self-government or attempts at cultural assimilation. Although it was theorized initially as a new social and ideological basis for the Kurdish liberation movement, democratic confederalism is now presented as a anti-nationalist, multi-ethnic and internationalist movement. The general lines of democratic confederalism were presented in March 2005, through a declaration \\"to the Kurdish people and the international community\\" and, in later years, the concept was further developed in other publications, such as the four volumes of the \\"Manifesto of Democratic Civilization\\". Shortly after being released, the declaration was immediately adopted by the PKK, which organized clandestine assemblies in Turkey, Syria and Iraq, which resulted in the creation of the Kurdistan Communities Union (Koma Civakên Kurdistan, KCK). The first chance to implement it came during the Syrian Civil War, when the Democratic Union Party (Partiya Yekîtiya Demokrat, PYD) declared the autonomy of three cantons in Syrian Kurdistan that eventually grew into the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria). History  Background  Created in the 1970s under the context of Cold War geopolitical bipolarity, the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) was initially inspired by national liberation movements across the planet, many of whom were influenced by Marxist-Leninist ideals and left-wing nationalism. Over the years, however, the PKK has distanced itself from these ideologies, considering that the Kurdish question was not a mere problem of ethnicity and nationality solved by the revolutionary seizure of state power or the constitution of a independent state. Becoming a major critic of the very idea of a nation-state and even of national and social liberation from a Marxist-Leninist perspective, Abdullah Öcalan initiated a substantial transition from the Kurdish liberation movement in search of a form of socialism distinct from the statist and centralizing system associated with the former Soviet superpower. This breaking up process was consolidated after the capture and arrest of Öcalan by the Turkish intelligence services in 1999. Although he is kept in isolation on the prison island of İmralı, Öcalan used his time not only to prepare his defense strategy in the course of the Turkish process which had sentenced him to death, but also to elaborate his proposals on the Kurdish question and on its political solution. Having access to hundreds of books, including Turkish translations of numerous historical and philosophical texts from Western thought, his plan was initially to find theoretical foundations in these works to legitimize the PKK's past revolutionary actions and discuss the Kurdish–Turkish conflict in the 20th century within a comprehensive analysis of the development of the nation-state throughout history. Thus, Öcalan began his studies from Sumerian mythology and the origins of Neolithic cultures, as well as from the history of the first city-states. But it was the readings of thinkers like Friedrich Nietzsche (whom Öcalan calls \\"the prophet\\"), Fernand Braudel, Immanuel Wallerstein, Maria Mies, Michel Foucault, and particularly Murray Bookchin,, that led him to a definitive break with the Marxist-Leninist socialist perspective and develops a new proposal for democratic socialism called democratic confederalism. In 2005, while the European Court of Human Rights condemned Turkey for “inhumane treatment” and “unfair prosecution” in the case of Öcalan, calling for a new trial for the Kurdish leader, Öcalan issued \\"Declaration of Democratic Confederalism in Kurdistan\\", where he laid the groundwork of the democratic confederalism. Later, the concept was further developed and presented in works such as \\"Democratic Confederalism\\" and \\"Manifesto of Democratic Civilization\\" (the latter in four volumes). Concept Characterized by the needs of the Kurdish movement spread across Turkey, Syria, Iran and Iraq, the Öcalan's studies that resulted in democratic confederalism addressed various aspects of Kurdish society in the fields of anthropology, linguistics, international politics, international law and the feminist approach called jineology, this one especially inspired in the struggle of women of the PKK as Sakine Cansiz. His greatest theoretical inspiration was the ideas of on social ecology and libertarian municipalism from the American anarchist Murray Bookchin. In his works, Bookchin argues that the submission and destruction of nature is the continuation of the submission of other human beings to capitalism. Establishing a connection between the ecological crisis and capitalist society, the American philosopher observes that the social structure of humanity needs to be rethought and transformed from a destructive capitalist society to an ecological social society that maintains a balance between its parts and where its communities can organize their lives independently from a municipal-confederative entity. Deeply admired by Bookchin's conceptions, Öcalan developed a critical view of nationalism and the nation-state that made him interpret peoples' right to self-determination as \\"the basis for the establishment of a basic democracy, without the need to seek new political frontiers\\". Based on this, the Kurdish leader defends that the political solution for the Kurdish people does not involve the foundation of a new national state, but the constitution of a democratic, decentralized and autonomous system of self-organization in the form of a confederation. The main principles of democratic confederalism can be summarized in: * The new political, philosophical and ideological approaches of the Kurdish liberation movement finds its most appropriate expression in the so-called democratic socialism. A free Kurdistan is only conceivable as a democratic Kurdistan. * The Kurdish movement does not work for creating a Kurdish nation-state based on the right of self-determination of peoples, but considers this right \\"as the basis for the establishment of grassroots democracies\\" without aiming new political borders and is seeking to a system of democratic self-organization in Kurdistan with the features of a confederation that \\"provides a frame-work within which inter alia minorities, religious communities, cultural groups, gender-specific groups and other societal groups\\" can organize themselves autonomously. * The democratization process in Kurdistan encompasses \\"a broad societal project aiming at the economic, social and political sovereignty of all parts of the society\\", as well as the creation of necessary institutions and the elaboration of instruments that guarantee and enable society self-government and democratic control, in which each decision-making process (organized in open councils, municipal councils, local and general parliaments) should have the direct involvement of local communities. A self-government model allow a more adequate implementation of basic values such as freedom and equality. * The solution of the Kurdish question should be tried together with a process of democratization not only of all countries that exercise hegemonic power over the different parts of Kurdistan, but also extends across the entire Middle East. A new democratic policy, however, could only exist from democratic parties and their affiliated institutions \\"committed to the interests of the society instead of fulfilling state orders\\". * While this democratic reforms is not yet possible, a peaceful coexistence with the nation-state is admitted as long as there is no intervention in central issues of self-government or attempts at social assimilation, as well as this coexistence does not mean acceptance of its \\"classic state structure with its despotic attitude of power\\". At the end of this process of subjection to democratic reforms, the nation-state must become a more modest political institution, functioning as a social authority that observes functions only in the fields of internal security and in the provision of social services, and its state-related sovereign rights are only limited. * The health system and the right to native language and culture education must be warranted by both state and civil society. * The freedom and rights of women must be a strategic part of the fight for freedom and democracy in Kurdistan, as well as the environmental protection must be taken seriously during the process of social change. * The individual freedoms of expression and choice are irrevocable. Freedom of information is not only an individual right, but an important social issue who depends on the existence of an independent media whose communication with the public is marked by democratic balance. * The economic resources are not the property of the state but of the society, and its just redistribution is also extremely essential \\"for the liberation process of the society\\". An economy committed to the population should also be based on the implementation of an alternative economic policy that does not aim solely at profit, but a production based on sharing and in satisfying basic natural needs for all. Implementation On June 1, 2005, the PKK officially adopted the democratic confederalism program at the end of the 3rd General Assembly of the People's Congress of Kurdistan (Kongra Gelê Kurdistan). Thereafter, the Kurdish liberation movement began to form clandestine assemblies immediately in Turkey, Syria and Iraq, which in 2007 resulted in the creation of the Kurdistan Communities Union (Koma Civakên Kurdistan, KCK), the organization established to put into effect Öcalan’s concept. The KCK brings together Kurdish political parties - as Democratic Union Party (Partiya Yekîtiya Demokrat, PYD), Kurdistan Free Life Party (Partiya Jiyana Azad to Kurdistanê, PJAK), and Kurdistan Democratic Solution Party (Partî Çareserî Dîmukratî Kurdistan, PÇDK)-, civil society organizations and armed groups in all countries in the region over the different parts of Kurdistan. Inspired by the project of democratic confederalism, mayors of the Party of the Democratic Society Party (Demokratik Toplum Partisi, DTP) started a fight for collective rights of a political nature in Turkey through civil disobedience campaigns. Challenging the laws that prohibit the official use of the Kurdish language, these politicians begin to use the municipal services and dispatch official correspondence in Kurdish, to reinsert Kurdish names in public places and to spend resources for the development and spread of the Kurdish language. However, these policies made the DTP mayors and deputies targets of judicial harassment, and the Kurdish party was banned by the Turkish Constitutional Court in 2009. It was during the Civil War in Syria that an opportunity arose to implement Ocalan's new political doctrine deeply, after the PYD declared the autonomy of three cantons in Rojava, a region comprising parts of the north and northeast of Syrian territory. Creating a political entity opposed to the capitalist nation-state, Rojava experienced an original experience of democratic, decentralized and non-hierarchical society, based on feminist, ecology, cultural pluralism, co-operative sharing economy ideas, and participatory politics and consensual construction.

Ibtina theory is a theory for explaining the process and mechanism of \\"religious knowledge\\" formation. Overview The theory was formulated and developed for the first time by Ali Akbar Rashad in 2009 and considered, studied and criticized by philosophers of religion as a new theory. Ali Akbar Rashad explained the theory in his book “Logic of Understanding Religion”, moreover, many books and articles has been written and published by Iranian thinkers affected by this theory.Rashad, Ali-Akbar, Nazariye Ibtina (\\"Ibtina theory\\"), Sazmane Entesharate Pajuheshgahe Farhang va Anisheye Eslami (IICT), Tehran, 1389. In 2009, an assembly held by National Secretary of Chairs and Forums for Theorization, Critique, Innovation and Debate” (affiliate center of Iranian Supreme Council of the Cultural Revolution) to investigate and criticize the claims of this theory; consequently, after numerous debates and discussions it has been announced as a new theory in the field of “logic of Understanding Religion” and “Philosophy of Religious Knowledge”. In the same year, Ali Akbar Rahad was nominated for \\"eminent theoretician\\" (Farabi International Award) for his theorizing and then received prizes and awards from UNESCO, ISESCO, Ministry of Science, Research and Technology (Iran) and the President of Iran.  Claims of the theory  Ali Akbar Rashad explained in his books and articles that Ibtina theory it to explain the process and mechanism of religious knowledge formation. He claims that religious knowledge is \\"the outcome of Permissible effort to explore religious statements and teachings\\". In another word (expression), \\"epistemic system derived from the usage of valid and permissible methodology for exploring religious propositions\\" is called religious knowledge. Philosophy of religious knowledge is also \\"philosophical quasi-science which is in charge of ultra-perspective and rational study on general principles for resulting religious knowledge of fundamental problems of religious knowledge\\". He claims that “some theories on the process and method of formation and resulting knowledge –in general sense (proper and improper) more or less have been presented by some philosophers. But, no one has presented a revised discussion of the process and mechanism of religious knowledge formation.” Although through some theories that has been presented on the religious knowledge we can acquire some view points of masters of knowledge. But they never present the discussion in the clear and self-evident manner about the process and mechanism of religious knowledge formation. From among the western thinkers, Hermeneuticians have discussed on the method of knowledge formation and the influence of some epistemic and non- epistemic factors in interpretation of the text. But they have not explained the process of religious knowledge formation. Also the theory of contraction and expansion which is a hermeneutical theory, concerns the justification of the problem of \\"religious knowledge evolution\\", but not the explanation of \\"knowledge formation\\".Rashad, Ali-Akbar, Manteqe Fahme Din (\\"Logic of Understanding Religion\\"), Sazmane Entesharate Pajuheshgahe Farhang va Anisheye Eslami (IICT), Tehran, 1389.

Named after the House of Hohenzollern, the redoubt was fought for by German and British forces. Engagements took place from the Battle of Loos to the beginning of the Battle of the Somme on 1 July 1916, including the Action of the Hohenzollern Redoubt in 1915 and the British Attack at the Hohenzollern Redoubt from 2 to 18 March 1916. Background In the summer of 1915 the German armies continued the strengthening of front trenches, communication trenches and strong-points ordered by Chief of the General Staff General Erich von Falkenhayn, who on 25 January had also ordered the building of more defensive lines behind the front trench. Crown Prince Rupprecht the Sixth Army commander and some Western Front generals had objected to this policy, as an invitation to German troops to retreat rather than fight. After the experience of the Battle of Festubert, where Allied artillery had proved capable of destroying a great width of front trench, opposition had been abandoned and the work carried on as quickly as possible. In early May, Falkenhayn had also ordered that a second defensive position be built behind the whole of the Western Front, to force an attacker to pause to move artillery forward into range.  German preparations in 1915  Map of the Hohenzollern Redoubt area, September 1915 A number of pit-heads known as and auxiliary shafts called had been built around Loos-en-Gohelle in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region of France, when the area was developed by the mining industry; was close to the north end of a spoil-heap () known as \\"The Dump\\". The had been tunnelled or hollowed out by both sides, to provide observation-posts and machine-gun nests. The Dump was high, with an excellent view in all directions. New fortifications were built as quickly as possible, after the Franco-British offensives in May and June 1915. At Dump and Fosse trenches, on a slight rise in front of the original front line, a new defensive work wired for all-round defence was built and named the . The face of the redoubt was long and curved, with extensions to join with \\"Big Willie\\" Trench to the south and \\"Little Willie\\" Trench to the north. British planners judged the Hohenzollern Redoubt to be the strongest defensive-work on the whole of the front. In the area of Fosse 8, more fortifications were built in July by the German 117th Division, after it had fought at Vimy Ridge in May and June; once a period of reorganisation at Roubaix was over, the division returned to the line on 9 July. British attacks 13–19 October 1915 Starting during the Battle of Loos (25 September – 15 October 1915), British units carried out a concentrated attack on the Hohenzollern Redoubt which lasted from 13 – 19 October 1915. The British 9th (Scottish) Division captured the redoubt and then lost it to a German counter-attack. The final British assault on 13 October failed and resulted in mostly in the first few minutes. The official history of the war suggested that \\"The fighting on the 13th–14th October had not improved the general situation in any way and had brought nothing but useless slaughter of infantry\\". General Sir Douglas Haig thought it might be possible to launch another attack on 7 November 1915 but heavy rain and accurate German shelling during the second half of October finally persuaded him to abandon the attempt. British attacks 2–18 March 1916 Over the winter months, the British 170th Tunnelling Company dug several galleries under the German lines at the Hohenzollern Redoubt, which had changed hands several times since September 1915. In February 1916, mining was being conducted at the Quarries and near Fosse 8, where explosions were frequent and were followed by infantry attacks to occupy the near lip and by sapping forward. In March 1916, the west side was held by the British and the east side was still occupied by the Germans, with the front near a new German trench known as the Chord. The Germans had an unobstructed view of the British positions from a slag heap named Fosse 8 and during previous fighting no man's land had become a crater field. On 2 March, four mines (the largest yet sprung by the British) were detonated, followed by a British advance towards the German lines. The 12th Division intended to capture the crater field, gain observation from crater lips over the German defences back to Fosse 8and end the threat of German mine attacks. German counter-attacks drove the British back by 6 March. On 18 March, the Germans surprised the British with five mines. The 37th Brigade was eventually relieved by the 35th Brigade, and by the time that the crater fighting died down, both sides held the near sides of the craters. Subsequent operations in 1916 Following the British attacks of 2–18 March, the German units at the Hohenzollern Redoubt were considerably reinforced. The new German garrison of the redoubt remained doubled for several days and a high level of alert maintained until the end of the month, when the possibility of another British attack was considered to have ended. On 19 March 1916, the British exploded another mine at the redoubt and the Germans sprung two mines in the Quarries on 24 March. British mines were blown on 22 April 1916; German mines were exploded on 31 March, on 23 April 1916. Each explosion was followed by infantry attacks and consolidation of the mine lips, which were costly to both sides and turned more areas of no man's land into crater fields. The British 12th Division was eventually relieved on 26 April 1916 and missed the German gas attacks at Hulluch which began the next day, from an area close to the Hohenzollern Redoubt. Engagements continued until the summer, when the British and Commonwealth forces moved their focus south, in preparation of the Battle of the Somme .

He ruled the present- day Gujarat and surrounding areas from his capital Anahilapataka (modern Patan). He ascended the throne as a child, and his mother Naikidevi acted as the regent during his short reign. The Chaulukyas repulsed a Ghurid invasion during his reign. The Paramara king Vindhyavarman made attempts to evict the Chaulukyas from Malwa during his reign, and succeeded in regaining control of Malwa either during Mularaja's lieftime or shortly after his death.

His mother Naikidevi was the daughter of one Paramardin. According to one theory, this Paramardin was the Goa Kadamba chief Shivachitta Paramadideva (1148–1179 CE). Another theory identifies him with the Chandela king Paramardi. The second theory is based on the identification of \\"Kakaḍādaha\\" with similar- sounding \\"Gāḍāraghaṭṭa\\". The Chandela-era Garra inscription mentions that a Chandela warrior named Rauta Pape lost his life in a battle at Kakaḍādaha. According to the 14th century chronicler Merutunga, Naikidevi fought the Muslims at Gāḍāraghaṭṭa. This appears to be same as Kasahrada, where a Chaulukya army defeated the Ghurids in 1178 CE. Mularaja ascended the throne as a young child after his father's death. His mother Naikidevi acted as the regent during his short reign.  Battle of Kasahrada  The most notable event of Mularaja's short reign was the Battle of Kasahrada, which took place in 1178 CE at modern Kyara (in Sirohi district; also called Kayadara or Kayadram in some records). In this battle, the Chaulukya forces defeated the Muslim Ghurid invaders led by Muhammad of Ghor. The Chaulukya forces led by Chief Commander Jhala Durjanshal included the armies of their feudatories such as the Naddula Chahamana ruler Kelhanadeva, the Jalor Chahamana ruler Kirtipala, and the Arbuda Paramara ruler Dharavarsha.  Native accounts  The later Chaulukya inscriptions as well as the chroniclers of Gujarat greatly praise Mularaja for this victory: * The poet Someshvara boasts that Mularaja defeated the lord of Turushkas (Turkic people), and crushed the mlechchha (foreign) army. * Balachandra mentions that Mularaja defeated the mlechchha king despite being an infant. * Udayaprabha Suri, in his Sukrita-Kirti- Kallolini, states that Naikidevi gave Mularaja an army to play with. With this army, Mularaja defeated the Hammira (Sanskrit form of Emir) and his mlechchha army, whose soldiers were covered from head to toe in order to protect themselves. * Arisimha also mentions that Mularaja defeated the Muslims. * An inscription of Bhima II states that even a woman could defeat Hammira during the reign of Mularaja. The 14th century chronicler Merutunga credits the victory to Mularaja's mother Naikidevi, introducing supernatural elements in his account of the battle. According to Merutunga, Naikidevi fought with the mlechchhas at Gāḍāraghaṭṭa, and conquered their king. Massive unseasonal rain clouds came to support her, attracted by her virtuous character. The Sundha Hill inscription of the Jalor Chahamanas boasts that Kirtipala routed the Turushka army at Kasahrada. It also states that his brother Kelhanadeva erected a golden gateway (torana) at the shrine of the deity Somesha after destroying the Turushkas. Kelhanadeva was the ruler of Naddula; according to the legendary chronicle Prithviraja Vijaya, Muhammad of Ghor had captured Naddula during his invasion of India. Kelhanadeva managed to regain control of Naddula after the victory at Kasahrada.  Muslim accounts  According to the 13th century Persian chronicler Minhaj-i-Siraj, Muhammad of Ghor marched towards Nahrwala (the Chaulukya capital Anahilavada) via Uchchha and Multan. The \\"Rae of Nahrwala\\" (the Chaulukya king) was young, but commanded a huge army with elephants. In the ensuing battle, \\"the army of Islam was defeated and put to rout\\", and the invading ruler had to return to without any accomplishment. Nizam-ud-din gives a similar account, and states that Muhammad of Ghor marched to Gujarat via desert. The 16th century writer Badauni also mentions the invader's defeat, and states that he retreated to Ghazni with great difficulty. Firishta also states that the ruler of Gujarat defeated the Muslim army \\"with great slaughter\\", and the remnant of the defeated army faced many hardships during its return journey to Ghazni.  Alternative chronology  None of the Chaulukya inscriptions and chroniclers mention the invading king's name, simply describing him as a mlechchha, Turushka or Hammira. However, modern historians identify him with Muhammad of Ghor. According to an alternative theory, the Battle of Kasahrada took place during the reign of Mularaja's successor Bhima II. This theory is based on some Muslim chronicles, which state that \\"Bhim Dev\\" was the one who defeated Muhammad of Ghor. Moreover, an 1178 Kiradu inscription, issued during Bhima's reign, records repairs to a temple damaged by the Turushkas. The proponents of this theory argue that Mularaja's forces defeated another king, or that Muhammad of Ghor invaded the Chaulukya territory twice around 1178 CE. For example, H. C. Ray suggests the following alternative identifications of the invaders during Mularaja's reign: ; The Ghaznavids : Mularaja has been described as the conqueror of \\"Garjanaka\\" in some records. The term \\"Garjanaka\\" refers to the Ghaznavids in some other Sanskrit records, and therefore, the invaders during Mularaja's reign may have been the Ghazanvids. However, Ray himself points out that the Ghaznavid ruler Khusrau Malik was not strong enough to launch an expedition against the Chaulukyas in the mid-1170s. Therefore, this identification is unlikely to be accurate. ; The Sumras : The Sumras ruled the neighbouring region of Sindh of during this time. However, this identification is also doubtful. A. K. Majumdar points out that the Sumras may not have been Muslims during the 1170s, and were not called \\"Turushkas\\". Moreover, they were petty chiefs at this time, and their own kingdom was threatened by the rising Ghurid power. ; A Ghurid reconnaissance army : According to this theory, Muhammad of Ghor sent a reconnaissance mission to the Chaulukya territory, sometime during 1176-1178 CE, in preparation of his later invasion in 1178 CE during Bhima's reign: The reconnaissance army was defeated during Mularaja's reign, while the main Ghurid army was defeated at Kasahrada during Bhima's reign. This theory is also unlikely to be accurate. None of the Muslim chronicles mention an earlier Ghurid expedition to the Chaulukya territory. Most notably, none of the Chaulukya (or other Indian) accounts mention that Bhima achieved a victory against the Ghurids. Such a significant victory would not have been overlooked by the native chroniclers. It is more likely that Mularaja died shortly after the battle, and the Muslim chroniclers wrongly mentioned his successor Bhima as the king who was reigning at the time of the battle.  Rebellion in Malwa  The Paramara kingdom of Malwa had come under Chaulukya control during the reign of Mularaja's predecessors. During Mularaja's reign, a famine occurred in Gujarat. Taking advantage of this, the Paramara king Vindhyavarman made attempts to regain control of Malwa. The Chaulukya general Kumara was in-charge of the operations against Vindhyavarman. According to Surathotsava, written by Kumara's son Someshvara, Kumara defeated Vindhyavarman. After his victory, Kumara destroyed Vindhyavarman's town Gogasthana, sank a well where the Paramara palace once stood, and plundered Malwa. Vindhyavarman was ultimately successful in regaining control of Malwa. According to historian R. C. Majumdar, he accomplished this during the reign of Mularaja. However, A. K. Majumdar believes that Malwa remained under Chaululkya control during Mularaja's reign.  Death  Mularaja died at a very young age in 1178 CE, and was succeeded by his brother Bhima II.

Efti is a soluble version of the immune checkpoint molecule LAG-3. It is an APC Activator used to increase an immune response to tumors, and is administered by subcutaneous injection. Efti has three intended clinical settings: * as adjuvant to cancer vaccines (in a low, effective dose of ~250 µg) * as first-line 'chemo-immunotherapy,' that is, combined with standard chemotherapy (e.g. paclitaxel) * in combination immunotherapy with PD-1 treatments (e.g. pembrolizumab) Eftilagimod alpha is in Phase II clinical testing. Currently, the main indications for the drug are metastatic breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).  Background  Eftilagimod alpha (\\"efti\\" in short) is a soluble LAG-3 fusion protein that activates antigen-presenting cells. It is a 160 kDa protein consisting of the four extracellular domains of LAG-3 fused to the Fc region of an IgG1(LAG-3Ig). Efti binds preferentially to a subset of MHC class II molecules that are enriched in lipid rafts and/or composed of stable peptide-MHC II (pMHCII) complexes. On T cells, membrane-anchored LAG-3 is an LAG-3 is an inhibitory receptor downregulating T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling. Efti – as a soluble LAG-3 protein – is an MHC class II agonist and therefore a dendritic-cell activator, causing increased antigen presentation to cytotoxic (CD8+) T cells. In the absence of antigen presentation via MHC class II molecules, efti reactivates dormant antigen-experienced memory T cells, allowing them to recognize their antigen targets at the tumor site.  History  Soluble LAG-3 was first established as a dendritic-cell activator in the late 1990s. Frédéric Triebel, who discovered LAG-3 in 1990, worked through the 1990s at his laboratory at the Institut Gustave Roussy, in collaboration with INSERM and Merck Serono, to elucidate LAG-3’s role in the adaptive immune system. Triebel et al. had successfully produced a soluble LAG-3Ig fusion protein by 1995 and subsequently discovered its anti-cancer properties in vivo in different mouse tumor models in 1990. Shortly thereafter in 2001, Triebel formed a biotechnology company called Immutep SA in order to develop the therapeutic potential of LAG-3. Immutep was acquired by Prima BioMed in 2014 and as a result Eftilagimod alpha became Prima BioMed's lead compound. In 2017, Prima BioMed changed its name to Immutep to reflect its developmental focus on LAG-3 therapeutics.  Clinical Trials   Ongoing Clinical Studies  As of February 2020, three clinical studies are ongoing: = Metastatic breast carcinoma (HER2− HR+) = In the AIPAC study efti is administered in combination with paclitaxel to women with HER2− metastatic breast cancer whose disease progressed after endocrine therapy. This Phase IIb trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study aiming to enroll 241 patients. It had an open run-in phase with 15 patients being treated and the results were published at the 2018 ASCO annual meeting. The study is ongoing and is expected to show results in the first half of 2020. = Solid Tumors = The INSIGHT Phase I study is investigating the feasibility and safety of different routes of drug delivery (e.g. intra-tumoral, intra- peritoneal, and subcutaneous). = Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) and Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) = In the TACTI-002 Phase II study, efti is administered in combination with pembrolizumab in three distinct and independent cancer indications (following a basket trial design): # First-line metastatic NSCLC # Second-line metastatic NSCLC in patients refractory to PD-L1 or PD-1 therapies such as pembrolizumab, nivolumab, avelumab) # Second-line HNSCC In each of the three indications, a first cohort of patients is treated and only if a certain pre-determined number of tumor responses is reached may a second cohort of patients be enrolled. This follows the Simons two-stage design. At the 2019 SITC meeting, Immutep released interim results from their first-line metastatic NSCLC trial before announcing that stage 2 of the trial had officially commenced. In early 2020, Immutep also announced in a press release the continuation of their stage 2 trial in HNSCC.  Completed Clinical Trials  = Phase I study in melanoma, 2016-2019 = The TACTI-mel Phase I study investigated the safety and potential synergies of efti in combination with the programmed cell death (PD-1) antibody pembrolizumab in unresectable or metastatic melanoma. The trial is noted as complete on clinicaltrials.gov; final results were published at the 2019 World Immunotherapy Congress in Basel, Switzerland. No major safety concerns and preliminary safety results were reported. = Phase I study in pancreatic cancer, 2009-2012 = In April 2009, Immutep announced its involvement in a Phase I study in pancreatic cancer conducted at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, Missouri. This 18-patient study evaluated for safety the combination of efti with gemcitabine, a chemotherapy drug, at doses up to 2 mg. The combination was found to be safe, however no significant differences were observed when comparing pre- and post-treatment levels of monocytes, dendritic cells, and T cells, likely due to sub-optimal dosing. The results of the study were reported online in Investigational New Drugs in August 2012. = Phase IIa study in metastatic breast cancer, 2006-2010 = A 30-patient Phase IIa open- label study in HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer has suggested that efti works as a chemo-immunotherapeutic in breast cancer, whereby chemotherapy creates tumor debris (circulating tumor antigen), and efti increases activation of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) as they take up that debris. This trial arose in part from the findings of a June 2005 online paper in Cancer Letters by two researchers at the Centre René Huguenin in Saint-Cloud near Paris who had collaborated with Frédéric Triebel. This paper demonstrated that the level of serum soluble LAG-3 correlated with improved survival in breast cancer patients whose tumors were estrogen or progesterone receptor- positive. In the study, patients on weekly low-dose paclitaxel (chemotherapy) were administered ascending subcutaneous doses of efti on days 2 and 16 of a 28-day cycle of paclitaxel over six cycles. The maximum efti dose was 6.25 mg. Paclitaxel was given on days 1, 8, and 15, meaning that patients were administered efti the day after paclitaxel had killed some tumor cells leading to antigenic tumor debris to be processed by dendritic cells for antigen presentation to CD8+ T cells. There were two notable outcomes to this study: * Response rate. At the six-month endpoint, 90% of patients had experienced a clinical benefit. The overall response rate was 50% based on RECIST criteria, which compared favorably with the 25% response rate observed in patients on paclitaxel monotherapy in the ECOG2100 study. The lead investigators of the chemo-immunotherapy combination trial also noted relevant differences in the two studies' patient groups: the ECOG2100 patients were on average younger than in the chemo-immunotherapy study, and a significantly lower percentage had disease in three or more sites upon entry into the trial. * Increase in relevant cell numbers. There was a sustained increase in the number of monocytes, NK cells, and activated CD8+ T cells in the patients' blood samples when compared with baseline data, with the increase at the six-month mark having a statistical significance in each case. Also, the percentage of PBMCs represented by dendritic cells and terminally differentiated effector memory T cells increased, again with statistical significance. The results of this study were reported in January 2010, and following an oral presentation at the ASCO Annual Meeting in June 2010 the results were published in July 2010 in the Journal of Translational Medicine. The study provided the basis of a new patent filing for Eftilagimod alpha. = Phase Ib study in renal cell carcinoma, 2005-2009 = Immutep's first Phase I study of efti in cancer patients was an open-label study in 21 metastatic renal cell carcinoma patients, with the drug being used as a monotherapy. These patients were known to be immunocompromised. The study, which began in late 2005, saw the patients administered ascending doses of efti (up to 30 mg per subcutaneous injection) fortnightly for six injections. The drug appeared to work at the two highest doses of 6 mg and 30 mg, with the primary outcomes among the eight patients who received these doses: * Activated T cells. The eight patients experienced sustained CD8+ T-cell activation (as measured by percentage of CD8+ T cells expressing CD69, CD38, HLA-DR) that was statistically significant compared to the lower doses (p=0.016). There was a greater percentage of effector-memory CD8+ T cells (CD45ROhi, CD45RA- and CD62L-), again, statistically significant compared to the lower doses (p=0.008). And there was an increase in the expression of co-stimulatory molecules CD27 and CD28 (CD27+CD28+, p=0.016; and CD27-CD28+, p=0.014). * Stable disease. 7 of the 8 patients dosed at 6 mg had stable disease at 3 months compared with only 3 of 11 at lower doses. This results had statistical significance (p=0.015). The results were published in Clinical Cancer Research in September 2009. = Early proof-of-concept studies, 2005-2007 = Immutep conducted two Phase I studies designed to evaluate the safety as well as immune response profile of efti in humans: * A March 2007 paper published in the Journal of Immune Based Therapies and Vaccines showed that efti could increase T-cell response potentiation in healthy subjects being administered the hepatitis B surface antigen HBsAg. This randomized and controlled study, conducted in Paris in 2005 saw 40 healthy subjects immunized with 10 µg of HBsAg, and then given either saline (8 subjects) or ascending doses of efti up to 100 µg (32 subjects). An additional 8 subjects received a conventional Hepatitis B vaccine, the Engerix-B product of GlaxoSmithKline. Subjects administered efti had higher levels of HBsAg antibody in their blood as well as higher levels of antigen- specific T cells. * An April 2007 online paper in Vaccine showed a similar T cell response potentiation, this time with 60 healthy subjects being administered Novartis' Agrippal influenza vaccine. This study, initiated in 2005 and completed in mid-2006, compared the influenza vaccine with the vaccine plus efti at doses up to 100 µg. For subjects that received efti there were higher levels of Th1-type CD4+ T cells in PBMC. Pre-clinical work, 2000-2008 The years 2000 to 2008 saw a number of demonstrations of efti's effectiveness in vitro and in vivo: * A June 2000 paper in the Journal of Immunology showed that efti (LAG-3Ig) could function as a vaccine adjuvant when immunizing mice with hepatitis B surface antigen and soluble ovalbumin. * An April 2002 paper in the Journal of Immunology showed the mechanism of action of efti in inducing maturation and activation of human monocyte-derived dendritic cells, whereby efti binds to MHC class II molecules expressed in plasma membrane lipid rafts on immature dendritic cells and induces morphological changes such as the formation of dendritic projections, an up- regulation of co-stimulatory molecules, and the production of IL-12 and TNF-α. * A February 2003 paper in Vaccine showed that, in human immature monocyte- derived dendritic cells, efti could induce the production of chemokines that would direct the migration of maturing dendritic cells to lymph nodes. Notably, LAG-3-matured dendritic cells were upregulated for CCR7. Later, the same authors showed that soluble LAG-3 could reduce the differentiation of macrophages and dendritic cells from monocytes, suggesting that the positive effect of LAG-3 as a dendritic cell-activator applied to pre-existing dendritic cells. * A March 2003 paper in Cancer Research from scientists at the University of Turin, which included Triebel as a co-author, showed that, in mice, efti could potentiate a DNA vaccine targeting HER2 in a spontaneous breast cancer model. * A March 2006 online paper in Vaccine showed, in animal models, that efti could immuno-potentiate therapeutic vaccines by inducing dendritic cell maturation. * An April 2006 paper in Cancer Research showed, in vitro, showed that efti could induce an antigen-specific CD8+ T-cell response in human PBMCs – evidenced by the upregulation of T cells that displayed cytotoxic activity and produced Tc1 cytokines. The investigators for this work used influenza matrix protein antigen and the tumor antigens Melan-A/MART-1 and survivin to verify this CD8+ T cell response. They found that a LAG-3-related adjuvant effect depended on direct activation of antigen- presenting cells. For this paper Triebel collaborated with scientists at the Instituto Nazionale dei Tumori in Milan, Italy. * A September 2007 paper in the Journal of Immunology, showed that efti could induce the activation of a large range of human effector T cells, resulting in the production of IFN-γ and TNF-α, among other cytokines. The investigators found that effector and effector-memory, but not naïve or central memory T cells, were induced by efti to a full Tc1 response. In their in vitro work with human blood samples the investigators found that efti bound all the circulating dendritic cells and a fraction of MHC class II+ monocytes. Significantly, 92% of samples responded at clinically meaningful levels to a first, short exposure of efti. The investigators contrasted the potency of efti with TLR1-9 agonists which, while inducing IL-10, are unable to induce a Tc1 IFN-γ response. * A March 2008 paper in the Journal of Immunology, again in collaboration with the Instituto Nazionale dei Tumori, showed in vitro that efti could induce the maturation of monocyte-derived dendritic cells to produce chemokines and TNF-α, and that, when given with CD40/CD40L, it could induce full functional activation of dendritic cells so that they could produce heightened levels of IL-12. IL-12 is required for the induction of IFN-γ, which in turn is critical for the induction of Th1 cells. * A June 2008 paper in Clinical Cancer Research demonstrated that efti at low doses could be used as a T cell adjuvant for cancer vaccines. For this work Triebel collaborated with Cell Genesys, a cancer vaccine company based in South San Francisco. Cell Genesys' lead product, GVAX, consisted of whole tumor cells genetically modified to secrete GM-CSF. When mice that had been inoculated with the B16 mouse melanoma cell line received both GVAX and 0.1 µg of soluble LAG-3, the result was a 7-day median survival advantage (47 to 54 days) over the mice which received only GVAX at day 3. Correlated with this survival data, the investigators noted higher levels of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes for the combination group, and a higher number of antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses. There was also a notable IgG1 humoral response.  Potential use in a liver cancer vaccine  In May 2015, Immutep (Prima Biomed at the time) announced a collaboration with NEC Corporation and Yamaguchi University in Japan in which Yamaguchi researchers would be combining efti with a peptide vaccine they had developed as a potential therapeutic for hepatocellular carcinoma.  Licensing in China  Immutep granted the rights to efti in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan in October 2013 to Eddingpharm, a privately held Chinese pharmaceutical company.  Manufacture  Efti is manufactured in CHO cells. Immutep worked with Henogen as the contracted manufacturing organization to provide efti for all trials until 2014. Immutep changed their contracted manufacturer to the Shangai-based WuXi PharmaTech, who began producing efti for all trials starting from 2016 onwards. 200-liter batches of efti are accepted for clinical trial use by multiple national agencies including FDA, PEI and MHRA. Recently, it was reported that upscaling to 2000-liter batches has initiated.

The VMM is an international award issued annually by London's Royal Horticultural Society. Ross is only the fourth Australian to receive the VMM since its inception in 1870. He is the only Australian in history to have been appointed a Life Fellow of the prestigious Royal Botanic Gardens Kew Guild, London. Career Ross's career began in the late 1970s with a move into the media producing and presenting gardening programs for ABC television in 1978 and later on the Seven Network's 11AM programme in 1980 as a Horticultural reporter on Seven National News. He was gardening editor for Sydney's Daily Telegraph for four years and worked on the former Sun Newspaper in Sydney for 10 years. Ross has presented a three-hour gardening program for Radio 2GB since 1980, making it one of the longest running, and highest-rating programs in Australian radio history. Ross has been with Australia's Channel Seven since the mid 1980s. Most of that time he has spent at Australia's number one lifestyle show, Better Homes and Gardens, on which he has presented over 900 episodes. Ross was awarded the Veitch Memorial Medal of the Royal Horticultural Society in 2011. In 2014 he won the Australian Institute of Horticulture's Golden Wattle Award for the advancement of the profession of horticulture in Australia through 'sustained exemplary conduct as a professional horticulturist'.http://aih.org.au/GoldenWattleAward2014 Ross has received treatment for several skin cancers and prostate cancer and cites his experience with chemicals in the early days of his career as a motivating factor in his interest in organic gardening. Australian Garden Council In November 2015 Ross was instrumental in the establishment of the Australian Garden Council with a focus on the promotion of gardening, garden education and garden tourism.http://aih.org.au/AGC2015 According to Ross, it was motivated by his view that, \\"For too long gardeners and horticulturists, the essence of a multi-billion dollar domestic industry, have been ignored, taken for granted and undervalued in Australia business, government, educational and community circles\\".http://sesl.com.au/blog/the-australia-garden-council- launch/ David Glenn, Tim Entwisle from the Melbourne Royal Botanic Gardens and gardening writer Trevor Nottle were also named as members of the founding council. Ross described the goal of the new council as being to \\"reinstate gardening on to the national agenda\\".

Biography Education Routson attended Albert Einstein High School. After briefly attending the Maryland Institute College of Art, he received a bachelor's degree from University of Maryland, College Park in 1993. Routson went on to earn his MFA from University of Maryland Baltimore County in 2003. In between his degrees, Routson worked as an artist assistant under painter Marilyn Minter and video artist Vito Acconci in New York. Routson briefly taught at the Corcoran College of Art and Design. Work Routson is primarily known for his video work, particularly his use of bootleg recording. Between 1999 and 2004, Routson made numerous recordings of contemporaneous Hollywood films using a handheld video camera inside a movie theater. Routson would balance the camera somewhere on his person and intentionally not look through the viewfinder. The videos often ended up largely obscuring the movie screen, either by angle or silhouette. For instance, Routson's recording of The Passion of the Christ blocked the movie's subtitles behind the back of a theatre seat.de Valck, Marijke, and Hagener, Malte, eds. Cinephilia : Movies, Love and Memory. Amsterdam, NLD: Amsterdam University Press, 2005. ProQuest ebrary. Web. 28 April 2015. While such recordings, known as camrips, are commonly uploaded on peer-to-peer file sharing sites, Routson's works were projected on the wall of art galleries. Routson showed numerous bootlegs in two shows at Team gallery in 2003 and 2004. Routson also created an edit of Matthew Barney's Cremaster 4. Routson cut a VHS recording of Barney's film down to a TV standard 22 minutes, added television commercials, credits, and an ABC television watermark logo. The work was intended to emulate the ABC program Saturday Night Movie. Routson work has faced legal complications. On October 1, 2004, Maryland ruled the unauthorized use of recording equipment inside a movie theater illegal. Routson accordingly stopped his bootlegging practice in 2004. Other of Routson's projects include a photography series in which he takes or purchases photographs of shopping-mall Easter bunnies sitting or standing by themselves, and the 2003 work \\"My Guitar\\" in which Routson displayed his Fender guitar along with a \\"For Sale\\" flyer. Reception of Routson's work has been mixed. One critic praises his Bootlegs, claiming the works give \\"urgency and pleasure to questions about art in the age of mechanical reproduction, long after the low-tech avant-garde had turned them into truisms.\\" Another, however, describes his appropriation work as \\"lazy\\" and \\"vampiric.\\" Exhibition and representation Routson is represented by Team Gallery in New York City.

The Government of India honoured him in 1962, with the award of Padma Shri, the fourth highest Indian civilian award for his services to the nation. Biography Bishnupada Mukerjee was born on 1 March 1903 at Barrackpore in the North 24 Parganas district of the Indian state of West Bengal. He did his early schooling at Barrackpore village school and Kolkata to pass the matriculation with a scholarship for further education. He passed the Intermediate examination from Scottish Church College, Kolkata with 13th rank in the University of Calcutta and joined the Calcutta Medical College to secure the degree of Bachelor of Medicine with first rank and honours in pharmacology, midwifery and Gynecology in 1927. Eden Hospital Calcutta School of Tropical Medicine Mukerjee did his residency under Green-Armytage at Eden Hospital for 18 months and moved to Calcutta School of Tropical Medicine where he worked under Sir Ram Nath Chopra who is reported to have successfully persuaded Mukerjee to turn to research by abandoning his medical practice. In 1930, he took up the post of an assistant secretary to the Drug Enquiry Commission and assisted the commission in preparing a report advocating for drug standardization and pharmacy control. From 1931 to 1933, he worked at the Calcutta School of Tropical Medicine on research on indigenous drugs when he received a Fellowship from the Rockefeller Foundation for research on vegetable drugs in China, America and Japan. He moved to Peking Union Medical College where he worked under renowned pharmacologist, H. B. Van Dyke.

His research work with Ram Nath Chopra brought out the first scientific paper on Sarpagandha (Rauvolfia serpentina) and its medical properties. His research on the medicinal values of Alstonia scholaris, Caesalpinia bonducella and snake venom are well documented. His research on posterior pituitary hormones and their effects on liver fat helped initiate a research program at School of Medicine, Toronto University the findings of which explained the lipotropic actions of choline, betaine and methionine. He also did research on dextrorotatory hydroocupridine derivatives, anterior pituitary extracts and cyanide poisoning. He devised methods for determining the prothrombin time, for prolongation of insulin effect and for biological standardization of liver extracts. His research findings were published by way of over 300 research papers in national and international journals.

Role in founding Videofreex Teasdale attended the Woodstock music festival during the summer of 1969 where he met and became friends with future Videofreex co-founder David Cort. Both having brought video equipment, the pair collaborated in filming the festival, placing emphasis on the crowds rather than the musical performers in their footage. After an unsuccessful attempt to sell the Woodstock tapes to the CBS news program 60 Minutes, Teasdale moved to Manhattan to found Videofreex along with Cort and Cort's then-girlfriend Curtis Ratcliff (Boyle 1997, p. 15). CBS executive Don West quickly became interested in the newly formed group's work, particularly their portrayals of youth and 1960s counterculture. He funded the shooting of the pilot of a new program that might replace The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour, which had recently been cancelled. The network declined to pick up the finished project, titled Subject to Change, deeming it too radical for network television. Due to the high cost of rent in SoHo, several members of Videofreex including Teasdale decided to leave the city but remain part of the collective.Teasdale, Parry. \\"Parry Teasdale.

He contributed to the editing of the independent documentary The World's Largest TV Studio, (Boyle 1997, p. 87), which provided coverage of the 1972 Democratic National Convention in Miami Beach, Florida. This work became the first broadcast television program to be shot with portable equipment.

In November 18231, Elijah Hoole of the Wesleyan Mission applied to the Government of Madras for granting permission for starting a school and preaching place for the native population in the Bangalore Cantonment.

The permission was granted and a small building measuring 30 ft. length and 13 ft. width was constructed under the supervision of Mr. Mowat. The present premises of the school in the Bangalore Cantonment has been owned by the Wesleyan Mission since then. In the same campus, Wesleyan Mission Press was established in 1840. In 1854, Sir. Charles Wood, President of the Board of Control, East India Company, sent out his famous Wood's Despatch to Lord Dalhousie, the then Governor-General of India, which called for major revamp in the educational system in British India, encouraging mass education for all castes (for the first time in the history of India), establishing government schools in each district, government aid to private schools, appointment of teachers and school inspectors, establishing universities at the major cities of Delhi, Bombay, Madras and Calcutta, amongst many other reforms. The Wesleyan Mission School was established in 1855, using a generous grant from the Government of Madras. Elijah Hoole in his book Personal Narrative of a Mission to the South of India, from 1820 to 1828 acknowledges the help rendered by the British Resident in Mysore, Arthur Henry Cole, in getting the support of the Maharaja of Mysore (p. 73, 74, 84, 85, 86, 207). It could be possible that the park adjacent to the Wesleyan Tamil Mission could have been named after Cole, to acknowledge this support to the Mission as Coles Park. If that's the case, then Cole's Park has been known by that name for nearly 200 years. The Wesleyan Mission School was established in 1855, with the main objective of educating children of native Tamil sepoys of the Madras Presidency Army, who were stationed at the Bangalore Civil and Military Station. The school was initially established on East Parade (present Manipal Centre on Dickenson Road), next to the Wesleyan Church (now CSI East Parade Church), with Ms. Little as the head mistress, with only a handful of students. The school was providing education in the native languages, along with skills such as knitting and sewing. The Wesleyan Tamil Girls School was moved to present site on Promenade Road, at the Wesley Tamil Mission compound, in 1888. By the beginning of World War I, the Wesleyan Tamil Girls School was the first all girls school in the Bangalore Civil and Military Station. Mrs. Little's Native Girls' School The School began on 2 September 1855, with 42 students of whom 11 were Christian, 16 non-Christian and the rest Roman Catholics. The school was started by Mrs. Little, a missionary's wife. Mrs. Little arrived in the Bangalore Civil and Military Station in 1854. Seeing the social status of women in Indian society, Mrs. Little was moved and wanted to start a school to educate Indian girl children. Her fiends in Islington, England, helped her in this cause, by sending gifts, which were sold in Bangalore, helping to raise funds to run the school for nearly 8 months. Many girl children were very happy to get an education, with Mrs. Little noting that many hardly missed classes even for a day. The school started at 9:00 am with an assembly. At 9:30 am, children joined the servants in saying Tamil prayers led by a catechist. Proper classes began at 10:00 am. The schedule of units taught were Tamil, followed by Scripture and History (in Tamil), then Conference Catechism and Geography (in Tamil). Finally, it was the English department with easy lessons, hymns and catechism. By 12:15, the children marched into the verandah, where the attendance was taken. Then the children sang the hymn 'There Is a Happy Land'. In conclusion, the students knelt down and said the Lord's Prayer in Tamil. After which, they were dismissed to go home for Lunch. The children came back at 2:00 pm for sewing and crochet classes. Some students who lived far away were unable to come back for the afternoon session. Mrs. Little records holding of the half yearly exams of the Native Girls' School in Bangalore on 2 July 1856. The examination in Scriptures were from Mathew Chapter 3 and 25. The other subjects examined were Tamil Geography, Tamil spellings and translation from English to Tamil. The children sang many Tamil hymns, and a few English hymns such as 'Here we suffer in grief and pain', 'There Is a Happy Land' and 'Lift up the Gospel Banner' in the tune of 'Away to School' from the 'Training School Song Book'. The exams were a private exam, and Mrs. Little hoped to have a Public Exam for the finals. In 1857, EKG, writes about a native widow, Elizabeth being sent to Bangalore from Madras to work as a teacher in Mrs. Little's School. Mrs. Symone's Wesleyan Mission School, Ulsoor Native Girls' School and Preaching- Room, Alasoor, Bangalore (p.184, 1865) A Street Scene in India, Outside the Wesleyan Girls School, Bangalore (January 1869, p.7) Wesley Tamil Church, Haines Road (2016) Anne M Symone provides a description of the Wesleyan Mission Girls School in Ulsoor (Qyazi Alasoor, near the Someshwara Temple). The school was a native house with a little passage, leading to an open sky courtyard, and the house supported by pillars. A chart of the World Map in Tamil and letters of the Tamil alphabet were hung on the wall. The girls were first taught to master the letters of Tamil, which were 234 with different combinations. Sand was used to trace the letters of the alphabet. The girls were all brown, some being fairer than others, with black eyes and hair. They wore a small petticoat, and a ravaky (short body, just reaching short of the waist), with no hats or footwear. Jewelry worn were nose-studs, earrings, anklets, silver belts, gold necklaces. All instructions were given in Tamil. The teacher rode a pony from Shoolay to reach the school in Ulsoor. The schools were funded by donations from England. The Wesleyan Mission Girls School in Ulsoor had 50-60 native girls, from families in the Ulsoor neighbourhood. The school building cost GBP 60, paid for by sale of articles sent to Mrs. Catherine Male (wife of Matthew Trevan Male) from supporters in Stockport, Richmond, Manchester, Acton, etc. (Catherine wife of Matthew Trevan Male of the Wesleyan Missionary Society who died on 29 August 1865 aged 49 and Fanny Lees child of Catherine and Matthew Male born 29 January 1861 and died 24 April 1861, are buried at the Agram Protestant Cemetery, Bangalore) The school in Ulsoor was for the higher caste girls, who refused to study with the lower caste. Mrs. Symon further writes about the annual examination which was held on 22 December 1865, were the students were examined for basic maths, Tamil Poetry, Tamil grammar and Geography. The school had 71 students now, and they had learned sewing and produced 86 garments. At this instance, a letter written by one of the students (P Marneekummal) to Mrs. Symon was read out. Dolls, bags, boxes were distributed as prizes and children were given cakes and fruit. The Ulsoor Wesleyan Mission School was closed in around 1954, and the school and staff were transferred to the Goodwills School at Promenade Road. Wesley Tamil Church, Haines Road William Sproston Caine in his book 'Picturesque India: a Handbook for European Travellers', published in 1890, describes the Wesleyan Tamil School on Promenade Road, Cleveland Town, St. John's Hill as being headed by a missionary. The missionary's house is recorded to being just next to the boarding school. The missionary was being assisted by a native preacher, zenana visitors, catechists, and bible women. The principal chapel of the mission is described as being at Haines Road, and another Wesleyan chapel being constructed at Shoolay (Wesley Tamil Church, Commisionarant Road). The other Wesleyan Tamil schools in the Bangalore Civil and Military Station were English boys middle school in the Cantonment bazaar (Methodist Mission High School, Dharmaraja Kovil St.), Anglo-Vernacular schools in Shoolay and Mootocherry, five Tamil schools, and five day-schools for girls (pp. 522–523). Fred Goodwill Fred Goodwill (1874-1969)) Documentation of the life of Rev. Fred Goodwill was done after extensive research by his grand daughter Jane Smith. Fred was born on 20 February 1874, to Elizabeth and Thomas Goodwill, Yorkshire, UK. Fred arrived in India in 1899, posted as the Superintendent of the Wesleyan Tamil Mission, Bangalore and Kolar Gold Fields. Fred was a scholar of the Tamil Language, and was also fluent in Canarese (Kannada) and Telagu (Telugu). Fred is acknowledged as an authority on Tamil Shaiva Literature, with authors quoting from his research. As one of the founding members of the Mythic Society, his published papers on the history of the Mysore State form the basis of history of the State, as we know it now. Fred was a keen photographer, who documented life in the British Bangalore Cantonment, in the early 1900s. His photos published as Tuck's Postcards, provide a valuable documentation of the history of the Bangalore Civil and Military Station. His 26 years service to the Wesleyan Mission saw his campaign strongly for the cause of women's education beyond class and caste. In his 26 years in India, Rev. Fred Goodwill contributed immensely to the education and progress of Tamil literature in Bangalore Cantonment. His name is associated with books on Tamil Literature published around that period in British India, and Fred Goodwill authored many academic articles on Tamil Literature, which were published in Journals. Fred's articles on Tamil literature are mainly on the Shaivism philosophy, Tiruvacakam, the poetry of the Shavite Saints Tirunavukkarasar, Manikkavacakar, Sundarar and Sambandar. Research done by Fred Goodwill is quoted by works of later authors of Dravidian culture, Shaiva Siddhanta and Ancient Tamil literature, along with that of George Uglow Pope. About the Tamil poetry and literature on Saiva Siddhanta he remarked \\"'Those who have studied the system unanimously agree that this eulogy is not a whit too enthusiastic or free worded. That the system is eclectic is at once apparent\\". Fred and the Wesleyan Mission School In British India, education of the girl child was considered a taboo by Hindus as well as Indian Christians. The Wesleyan Tamil Girls School, Bangalore was established in 1851. Around fifty years later, Fred Goodwill built on its foundations and improved the school to a great extent. In 1906, Fred Goodwill began to assist the principal of the school Ms. Sisterson, eventually becoming its manager. His wife, Alice also got actively involved in educating the children and took time to teach needlework and crafts. Fred Goodwill was keen to stress to importance of education of girls irrespective of any caste barriers in the Bangalore Cantonment. He once wrote in \\"preparing girls for future work we remember that we are preparing workers to hasten the time when foreign missionaries will be a thing of the past\\". In respect for his work at the Wesleyan Girls Tamil School was renamed as Goodwills Girls School. Present Status The school is trying to stay relevant to the cause of providing education to girls. It has now been upgraded to junior college and degree college in its compound. There are nearly 1200 girl children studying in the school. The school's original stone structure (built in 1888) still stands and is a prominent landmark of the Cantonment. An auditorium and a chapel has been added to the school, and also a library named after Ms. Little. The school once imparted education in Tamil, Telugu and Urdu. However, it now offers only English Medium Education. Goodwill Stalwarts * Ms. Little * Rev. Fred Goodwill * Ms. Rose Sisterson (1905-1938) * Ms. Roper * Ms. Rogerson * Ms. P Krishnappa * Miss.

Background and family The Boyville (Bovile, Boyvile, Boyvill, Boyvyle) family is recorded at Stockerston, Leicestershire as early as the 13th century. Although in a different county, Stockerston is only a few miles from Ridlington, where Hugh Boyville lived. There is a strong reason to believe that Hugh was a son of Sir Thomas Boyville (c.1370-1401) of Stockerston and his wife Elizabeth Walsh, as in 1439 John Boyville and Hugh Boyville were described as kinsmen to Thomas Walsh, a lunatic, when they were granted custody of his lands and person; Thomas Walsh was a brother of Thomas Boyville's wife Elizabeth. If Hugh was indeed a brother of John, he would have been his younger brother, as John was identified as Thomas’ heir in the inquisition post mortem that followed his death.Calendar of Inquisitions Post Mortem, 1st series, volume 18, No. 689. This being so, Hugh would have been born between John's birth in 1391 and shortly after their father's death in 1401. The History of Parliament estimates Hugh's year of birth as 1410, but does not explain the reasoning for that estimate. Details of Hugh's maternal ancestry were provided as evidence in litigation relating to property that took place in 1486 between his son William and John Norwich of Brampton Dingley. The evidence submitted in connection with that case stated that Hugh married, as her second husband, Alice who was a daughter of Richard Christian and sister and heir of his son who was also named Richard Christian. Hugh's offspring included at least two sons: * William – living in 1486. * Richard – who received the Manor of Little Oxendon from his father Hugh Boyvile of Ridlington, Rutland. It is not known how many times Hugh was married; of his two sons only William is specifically identified as a son of Alice Christian. Hugh died at some stage between the regnal year 7 Henry VI (i.e. 1467-8), when he transferred the manor of Little Oxendon to his son Richard, and 1486 when his son William claimed to have inherited property from his father. The relevant volume of the History of Parliament mistakenly estimates Hugh's death as taking place about 1465 without stating why that year was proposed. Career Offices that Hugh held included Sheriff of Rutland in 1437 and 1449 and Justice of the Peace for Rutland from 1437 to 1459. Hugh's alleged activities during his second term as sheriff gave rise to a petition to the House of Commons submitted by Agnes Bermythier. She stated that her husband Thomas Bermythier had been murdered on 19 October 1449 by a group of armed men procured by Sir Laurence Berkeley,Sir Lawrence Berkeley had represented Leicestershire in the Parliament of December 1421 and was described as being of Wymondham, Leicestershire when he served as High Sheriff of Warwickshire in 1439. Thomas Berkeley and Hugh Boyvil, then Sheriff of Rutland. She also alleged that Hugh empanelled a biased jury when the matter came before the justices of the peace and that Thomas Berkeley prevented her from suing and still threatened her. Agnes requested the Commons to ask the King that she might be able to sue her appeal against the men concerned. The final outcome of this case is not known. Hugh Boyvyle of Ridlington was one of the two Members of Parliament for Rutland in 1439-40 and 1447. Property Property that Hugh held or had claim to included: * Manor of Little Oxendon, Northamptonshire – which Bridges records Hugh transferred to his son Richard in 1467-8. * The manor of Naseby and land at Little Bowden and Great Oxendon, which his son William claimed in 1486 to have inherited from him.

Hasbún has Masters in Sociology, Philosophy and Journalism Research. Since 2009 he holds the reins of the Secretariat of Strategic Affairs of the Presidency. From July 2012 holds the post of Minister of Education, after the vice-president, Salvador Sanchez Ceren, renounce the ministry of state. The secretary also served as an advisor to the rectory in the Jose Simeon Canas Central American University (UCA) and project manager ; he was professor of sociology of the current Salvadoran president while studying at the Externado San Jose College. Salvadoran Kingmaker Hato Franzi Hasbún is and will be, one of the most emblematic figures of the socio- political history of the country and more recently, certainly, the nearest officer to President Mauricio Funes. Those who have known young, still remember him as a devoted basketball star while studying at the Salvadoran Grammar school and more than one followed suit to excel in this discipline. Optometrist by profession, but always interested in cultivating knowledge, Hasbún decides to study at American University (UCA) perhaps attracted by the so-called revolutionary currents that drove the Jesuits, although it posed was the conscience of men to decision, after \\"discovering their mission and carry it out\\" on the basis of the gospel. Among its successes is the first academic degree in Sociology, UCA, and a BA in Philosophy from the Autonomous University of Mexico. There is no certainty the years after winning their college credits he decided to become professor of Externado San Jose, however, some remember him for the scandal generated between faculty and parents to replicate Marxist theories and Liberation theology inherited by their teachers. The enormous impact of his teachings in the Externado have caused irreconcilable fractures, to the point that some parents wealthy -along with teachers-the institution decided to leave and form their own. At that point is, for example, the rise of school La Floresta, one of the most exclusive schools for girls. In his academic career two Masters are then added:. In Sociology, at the Complutense University of Madrid, and Philosophy at the Pontifical University of Comillas, both of Spain. Wartime Hasbún joined the ranks of the People (FPL), one of five guerrilla organizations then Liberation Forces. All his work was called \\"diplomatic fronts\\" who did travel to various countries in Latin America and Europe, although it is recognized that the major link was with Cuba -the characters hotbed of communism, including the brothers Fidel Castro and Raul Castro. It was reported that Manuel Pineiro, the commander Barbarossa was very close to Hato Hasbún. Pineiro was considered a leading figure of the Cuban Revolution as responsible for the construction of the security apparatus of the island and the expansion of leftist groups in Latin America. Barbarossa was born in Matanzas, the March 14, 1933, and died in Havana on 11 March 1998. After his death, also served as the strongman of the Castro, Ramiro Abreu, who is officially the Delegate of Cuba to Central America. Abreu has repeatedly visited our country, independent of the short time remaining in Salvadoran soil always reserved a space to talk with Hasbún. During the war, Hato would have used his position as Secretary of International Relations of the UCA to work on behalf of the then guerrilla. This would have caused some problems with the Jesuit company, which were overcome as he held various positions within the school during and after armed conflict. One of his greatest contributions at the end of the 80s would have brought a first proposed solution to the armed conflict. The initiative was designed in Mexico, with input from Jesuit priests, and this is where lies the latest version of the Peace Accords.  Life communicator?  Between 1992 and 1996, Hato Hasbún was Dean of Students, Director of Projects and International Relations Advisor to the Rector and professor in the departments of Philosophy and Sociology at the American University. In that period he would have strengthened the friendship with former student of Arts and novel journalist Carlos Mauricio Funes Cartagena, born on October 18, 1959 in San Salvador. Funes began his journalistic practice in 1986 as a reporter for Noticiero Tele 10 state program Channel 10. A year later, the news daily, Channel 12, which stresses their responsibility in covering political issues from the Legislative Assembly was incorporated . He stayed for four years with Channel 12. In 1991, the Foundation collaborates Hasbún Center Video-now known as UCA audiovisuals- Center and Funes called to participate in the project. In the years after the partnership between Hato Hasbún is accentuated and Mauricio Funes, which also shows how both have climbed slowly and have dealt with various tasks to survive. From 1993-2005, Hato Hasbún joins the interview a day, Channel 12, and when Funes relaunches its space as \\"Interview with Mauricio Funes\\", between 2005 and 2007, its mentor becomes CEO and Director of Research. No doubt selected for the TV program or how to approach these issues marked a differentiator young journalist, to profiling it as one of the best. It is perhaps in this period where the fine work of his disciple Hasbún note, along with the tenacity of a journalist. Between those years, 2005 and 2007 Hasbún is the Program Director of Surveys CS-polls. A company where he also works Funes Cartagena and whose measurements have served to feed the journalistic work of the interviewer. Political arena In 1997, it reminds one of the public appearances of Hato Hasbún, which matches the gain of the late Hector Silva in the mayor's office.

One person was killed and about 240 were injured. Damages were 17.5 million ($1.4M, €1.3M, or £960k as of May 2015). Accident At 07:10 local time (05:10 UTC), a passenger train ran into the rear of another at station. One person was killed and around 240 were injured, two seriously. The trains were a Metro Plus train with 700 people on board, and a Business Express train with 200 people on board. The Business Express train was travelling from to Park Station, Johannesburg, as was the Metro Plus train. The Metro Plus train was stationary at the station. The person killed was a security guard on the Metro Plus train. The driver of the Business Express train was airlifted to hospital. The two trains involved were Metroplus Express Train 0600 and Business Express Train 1602, both of which are operated by PRASA Rail. PRASA operates commuter rail services as Metrorail. Metrorail operates in the Gauteng province of the country as a separate region, known as Metrorail Gauteng. Within Metrorail Gauteng, the accident happened on the line serving Pretoria, Kempton Park, Germiston and Johannesburg. Business Express is the luxury commuter service brand of Metrorail. Investigation The Railway Safety Regulator investigated the accident. They were expected to release a statement on 29 April. The RSR released a final report on the incident in March 2016. The driver of the leading train, the Metroplus Express 0600 had stopped at a signal at Denver station at 7:06 because the driver could not read the signal due to the bright sunlight. He tried to contact the Centralised Traffic Control Office at George Goch via radio, but the communications systems were out of service at the centre due to a power failure. Meanwhile, the following train was travelling over the speed limit at about in a zone. It failed to slow at a yellow caution signal nor stop at the red danger signal. The driver applied the brakes from the stopped train, but the train only slowed to at the point of impact. At 91 km/h, the train would have required to stop. The report also notes that the power failure disabled radios, phones, and voice recording systems at the CTC office. There was no backup power supply. The CTC did have one cellular phone as a backup, but the driver of the Metro Express train was not given the number. Also, the CTC office did not have contact details for the Metro Express driver. The RSR had a contact at the PRASA called the Nominated Manager, however this arrangement was unsatisfactory because PRASA officials were late or unresponsive in providing requested materials during the investigation. They also failed to appear at scheduled hearings. Apparently the investigators were only able to get answers after applying pressure to upper management of PRASA. The investigators were also never able to interview the driver of Business Express Train 1602 since she was still in the hospital during the investigation.

Her campaign is based on 10 principles drawn up by Dr Alan Clifford, a Norwich based minister whose anti- gay and anti-Islam statements have led to police investigations in the past. She has aroused attention because of her strong and isolating views. She describes herself as biblically correct, not politically correct. She says she would “recriminalise homosexuality”, given the chance and claims that gay people “are not born that way, they are out to recruit. We are in danger. One demand after another.” She is opposed to the idea of gay people being allowed to donate blood. She would also make adultery a criminal offence, and is critical of rock music because \\"The lyrics are promoting immorality, the noise is deafening, and they also promote anarchy.\\" Her 2015 manifesto promises to “oppose the global warming fanatics and their pseudo science” and “restore the concept of a family wage with the father as the breadwinner.” She told the Belfast Telegraph: “I don’t consider myself extreme – not at all. “It is society that has moved. Not so far in the past, most people would have shared my views. My views are extreme because society has moved away from God's principles.\\" She opposes feminism \\"with all her might\\", and says it is to blame for the recession. \\"They [feminists] are responsible for the economy - they destroyed the whole concept of a family wage with the father as the bread-winner and the stay-at-home mother.

Cover illustration by the film's planned character designer and chief animation director, Yoshiyuki Sadamoto. , also known as Blue Uru, is an unproduced Japanese animated science fiction film project by Gainax intended as a sequel to their 1987 film Royal Space Force: The Wings of Honnêamise. Aoki Uru was originally planned to be directed by Hideaki Anno and scripted by Hiroyuki Yamaga, with Yoshiyuki Sadamoto serving as its chief animation director and character designer. During 1992–93, the Aoki Uru creative team produced a complete storyboard, a partial script, and a large collection of designs and pre-production art for the film; however, the project had been initiated without a secured budget, and its development occurred within a period of personal, financial, and managerial crises at Gainax that contributed to the indefinite suspension of work on Aoki Uru in July 1993. Aoki Uru co-producer Yasuhiro Takeda has argued that the themes and circumstances surrounding the film project influenced the creation of Anno's TV anime series Neon Genesis Evangelion, the planning for which began in the same month that Aoki Uru was put on hold. In the years following 1993, Gainax has made occasional announcements regarding a revival of the Aoki Uru concept, this time to be directed by Yamaga, with Sadamoto remaining attached to the project, including a multimedia proposal in the late 1990s, and the formal announcement of an English name for the film, Uru in Blue, at the 2013 Tokyo Anime Fair. In 2018, the Uru in Blue project was transferred from Gainax to Gaina, a different corporate entity and subsidiary of the Kinoshita Group, with the aim of a worldwide release of the film in 2022. Original proposal (1992–93) Aoki Uru, a film proposal envisioned as a sequel to Royal Space Force, was first developed during a difficult period of transition for Gainax between 1991's Otaku no Video and the debut of Neon Genesis Evangelion in 1995; Hideaki Anno described this time in his life as being that of \\"a broken man who could do nothing for four years; a man who ran away for four years, one who was simply not dead.\\" Although original company president Toshio Okada's involvement with his studio's creators stretched back more than a decade, as co-founder of both Gainax and its associated merchandising company General Products, as well as having personally provided the startup funding for Gainax predecessor Daicon Film, Yasuhiro Takeda described him as by 1991 having become a \\"hindrance\\" to Gainax creating \\"new and better anime.\\" Okada had suggested that Gainax stop making anime in favor of its profitable PC games, whereas Takami Akai argued that it was Gainax's involvement with anime that gave it its foothold in the gaming industry. Takeda related an occurrence where Hiroyuki Yamaga had stormed out of a planning session on the studio's future after Okada arrived at the meeting to announce he would not resign, saying, \\"I can't even talk with him in the same room.\\" In a 1995 interview, Okada recalled having discussed with Yamaga a different sequel concept from Aoki Uru while attending the 1987 Star Quest event in Los Angeles; the idea involved a starship from the world of Royal Space Force—indicated by Okada to be in the Alpha Centauri system—that makes a journey to present-day Earth 100 years after the events of the first film. Gainax's next main anime projects, however, were Gunbuster (1988–89), Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water (1990–91), and Otaku no Video (1991); storyboarding work on the Aoki Uru concept did not commence until March 1992, the same month Okada, under continuing internal pressure, departed Gainax. Yamaga replaced Okada in his previous role within Gainax's co-presidency, now to be exercised between Yamaga and Takeshi Sawamura; in his memoir, Takeda characterized Yamaga's position as being the public face of the studio, while actual day-to-day operations were run by Sawamura, with final approval of projects controlled by Akai, whose Princess Maker had proved a major source of income for the company. Takeda noted the leadership conflict during this period continued even after Okada's departure, but now between Sawamura and Akai; Akai himself would resign in September 1994, a little over a year before the debut of Evangelion, although he would return to Gainax's board of directors in 2001. Yoshiyuki Sadamoto, whose role on Aoki Uru was to be both character designer and chief animation director, commented that the 1992 origins of the sequel project followed the collapse of plans for Olympia, an anime Takeda describes as a \\"phantom project\\" for which Akai was the main creator, with Hideaki Anno slated as director. Yamaga felt that the difficulties the staff had found in drawing together around Olympia necessitated a return to the world of the original project for which the studio had been founded, in order to rediscover in it the qualities they wished to carry forward into a new generation of Gainax anime. Aoki Uru was to be set 50 years after Royal Space Force, on the reasoning that avoiding recurring characters or storylines from the original film would make the pitch easier for investors to understand. In a description by Sadamoto of the plot published in 1993, \\"Uru\\" was to be the name of the anime's protagonist, a former military pilot who had abandoned the armed forces and gone into hiding. Once the lover of a princess of Honnêamise's royal family, her abduction leads him to join a rescue team of four other elite pilots, each equipped with VTOL fighter jets and with their own individual reasons for taking on the mission. Sadamoto related that the anime would attempt to emphasize a visual experience of speed and intense aerial action scenes. Aoki Uru was to be directed by Anno and written by Yamaga, who had completed the first of the planned four acts in the script; its primary mecha designs were drawn by Shirow Masamune, creator of Ghost in the Shell, and Kazutaka Miyatake of Studio Nue; although well known for his work on Macross, Miyatake had also designed several of the space battleships in Gunbuster. Aoki Uru was to use the same team of art directors as Gunbuster, Masanori Kikuchi and Hiroshi Sasaki; the later Aoki Uru Frozen Designs Collection contained a listing of staff who had been confirmed to work on Aoki Uru as of the end of 1992, including Kazuya Tsurumaki and Takeshi Honda as animation directors working under Sadamoto, while Aoki Uru four technical directors included two of the three assistant directors of Royal Space Force (Shoichi Masuo and Shinji Higuchi), Otaku no Video director Takeshi Mori, and manga artist and illustrator Kenji Tsuruta, who would later make the character designs for Yamaga's 2002 Gainax TV series Magical Shopping Arcade Abenobashi. The task of drawing (design models) to guide the animators was to be assigned to Satoshi Kon, who had entered the anime industry two years before as a background designer on 1990's Roujin-Z, directed by Royal Space Force veteran Hiroyuki Kitakubo; during planning for Aoki Uru, Kon had also served as background and layout artist on Mamoru Oshii's Patlabor 2. The 1998 CD-ROM release of the designs from the 1992–93 Aoki Uru project affirmed Takeda's later statement that work began before the script was completed. The storyboard was created through a process that involved all the main staff going on a training retreat, where, in a series of meetings, they worked out a sequence of scenes for the entire film, from which Sadamoto then drew the complete storyboard. The exception to the process were the film's aerial action scenes, which were choreographed and then drawn for the storyboard by Anno. \\"Full-scale production work\\" on Aoki Uru was described as having begun in January 1993; by the end of the next six months Gainax had created over a thousand pieces of design art. In addition to the 338 images made for the film's storyboard, 50 pages of drawings were produced for the film's characters, 120 on its mecha, 30 on its \\"props\\" (small devices), 90 on its \\"art settings\\" (line drawings of an anime's \\"set designs\\" from which the actual background paintings are made), 21 \\"image boards\\" of concept art, and 370 \\"color boards,\\" paintings representing concepts for how scenes should be colored. The CD-ROM introduction noted that the 370 color board total included two choices for each scene, one from each of Aoki Uru two art directors, Kikuchi and Sasaki, who approached the task as a competition between themselves. Takeda and Yamaga were listed as co-producers for Aoki Uru; however, Yamaga would later state that it was his intention to begin the project, then \\"hand it over to Anno to direct and Yasuhiro Takeda to produce.\\" \\"I didn't know how to act, and to tell the truth, Aoki Uru had become something of a burden. I lacked motivation...\\" Takeda recalled. \\"I was just doing as I was told. Overall, I think I found producing Aoki Uru to be more of a chore than anything.\\" The lack of progress on the project led Akai to threaten Takeda with severing \\"all ties with me, public and private,\\" which led to a burst of effort toward satsfying Akai that Takeda compared to a mother and her grade school child \\"who'd barely finished his summer homework on the very last day of vacation.\\" Takeda characterized a fundamental problem in that Aoki Uru was intended as a feature film on which Gainax had begun work without having yet secured the financing to actually finish it; even as they attempted to raise capital, Takeda was himself obliged to \\"take out a few poor man's loans\\" in order to cover staff salaries: \\"I went to I don't know how many loan sharks, and ended up securing some 8 million yen. As a result of borrowing money, however, my day-to-day existence would end up becoming rather pathetic...\\" Aoki Uru was put on an indefinite production hold in July 1993. \\"We couldn't raise any more capital, and the staff just wasn't making any progress. Even Anno had lost his motivation. Anno, myself, and all the rest of the staff had worked so hard on this project, but we had nothing to show for it,\\" recalled Takeda, who himself considered resigning over the situation, but was dissuaded by Sawamura. The financial crisis associated with the halt on Aoki Uru led to what Takeda described as a \\"mass exodus\\" of staff from Gainax after Sawamura announced to employees that in the near-term future he could not guarantee meeting their payroll; during this period Takeda's own salary was cut to the point where he could no longer afford an apartment, sending his wife, SF author Hiroe Suga, back to live with her parents while he slept in a small company bunkroom. \\"For Anno,\\" Takeda later wrote, \\"I think Aoki Uru being put on hiatus was a weight off his shoulders. I'm sure he'd been just as anxious about it as I was, tormented by the thought that as the director he needed to be doing something to fix things, even though he didn't know what to do.\\" During this time, Anno agreed to a sudden offer from Toshimichi Otsuki of King Records to produce a TV anime together, a proposal that would eventually be developed into the series Neon Genesis Evangelion. Takeda speculated, Multimedia plan (later 1990s) In the years since the initial attempt to make Aoki Uru, Gainax has made periodic efforts to relaunch the project. Visiting the United States for Anime Expo 1996 shortly after Evangelion first aired on Japanese television, Hideaki Anno remarked, \\"Hiroyuki Yamaga is pretty serious as a matter of character, certainly—so he doesn't really think of compromising with the audiences. Therefore [Royal Space Force] wasn't a radical film from Yamaga's perspective. There's something like a sequel planned, but it's been stopped for now. Yamaga wants to make it 'the final anime of this century.' He wants to make it happen.\\" Although Okada and Yamaga had worked closely together to make Royal Space Force, its unproduced sequel became a point of argument between them in successive interviews with Animerica. The magazine's four-part discussion with Okada, conducted in 1995 at Otakon, concluded with an assertion that while still at Gainax, Okada had discussed and rejected the idea of making Yamaga's concept for Aoki Uru, on the grounds that \\"the story was almost exactly the same as [the 1984 film] Streets of Fire...Yamaga is a very clever and talented man. But even he couldn't come up with an idea he was really interested in, so instead he proposes this parody film.\\" Okada maintained that this was the reason he had advocated that Gainax not make another anime film \\"for at least two years,\\" until they had \\"the right emotion\\" behind it. Okada suggested during the interview that Animerica \\"some day\\" ask Yamaga himself about the issue; the magazine did so two years later during a talk conducted with Yamaga at FanimeCon in 1997. Yamaga characterized Okada's view of Aoki Uru (translated in the interview as Blue Uru) as a misinterpretation: \\"As an otaku, he's the type of person who tries to get as much information as he can. He tries to find the minute details of a thing, and based on those details, he makes assumptions. That's where his mistakes come out.\\" Streets of Fire was described by Yamaga as a conceptual inspiration for Aoki Uru, based on Takeda's fondness for the American movie and Yamaga's desire to motivate him as a producer, but only in the basic terms, said Yamaga, of \\"a cool hero goes to rescue the girl he loves...that was something Anno and Takeda were going to do. But now things have changed, and I'm doing Blue Uru, and that idea has been sort of swept away. From all that, I realize that a simple plotline, a guy rescuing a girl—from that baseline, you're allowed a lot of freedom. So the concept will probably remain in what I do, but it's not like it was based on any movie in particular.\\" Affirming Sadamoto's 1993 description of a film with an emphasis on speed, Yamaga contrasted Aoki Uru with his earlier movie project: The 1997 discussion with Yamaga appeared in Animerica over a year later in the May 1998 issue; the interview was accompanied by an additional sidebar featuring Yamaga's comments on the current status of Blue Uru, described by the magazine as one of Gainax's \\"new projects...nearing launch readiness.\\" Yamaga further detailed Blue Uru as a multimedia project to be done in successive stages: first as a PlayStation video game, second, as a serialized web novel to be written by Yamaga, and third, as a manga adaptation to be done by the project's longtime concept artist, Yoshiyuki Sadamoto. The anime film itself would follow after the three stages; Yamaga cited a budget of two billion yen would be needed for extensive computer graphics, \\"mostly for 3-D backgrounds...The animation itself, its movement and design, will come out of the traditional anime industry. I plan to preserve the traditional look of anime in the film.\\" Yamaga maintained his goal was not to make an anime that looked 3-D, but rather to use the approach for \\"emphasizing a sense of depth in a two-dimensional format,\\" mentioning that he was researching the programs PowerAnimator and LightWave 3D to develop Blue Uru. Yamaga characterized the staged nature of the Blue Uru plan as \\"to a certain extent\\" a financing tactic: > In Japan—and I think this is true in a great many other countries as well, > such as the United States—a great percentage of the rights to a project > accrue to the people who are putting up the funds for it. So by funding the > project at any level by ourselves, that helps us secure the general rights > to the material. We think it's important for us to keep as many rights as we > can. If we begin with a project that we fund, then we have more say over > what's done with it, and then if the project generates new funds, we can use > those to create a larger project, and again, have more say in it. In July 1998, Gainax released a CD-ROM entitled Aoki Uru Frozen Designs Collection containing the visual and script content created during the 1992–93 project, with a new commentary added as a QuickTime file. The commentary, in the form of a conversation between Yamaga and one of the intended technical directors of the earlier version of Aoki Uru, Kenji Tsuruta, expanded on Yamaga's reasoning behind the original film concept; as he had created a hero that suited Takeda as producer, he wished to have the film also suit Anno as director. Yamaga believed that Anno's personal template for a hero was Ultraman; in 1983 the two had made an amateur Ultraman movie together while at Daicon Film. However, Yamaga also viewed Takeda's \\"cool hero\\" approach as not a good fit with the Ultraman ethic, so to make Aoki Uru compatible for Anno, Yamaga turned instead to the physical mode of the film's events, deciding to make Aoki Uru an aeronautic action story so that Anno could express his particular sensibility as an animator of objects at high speed and in mid-air. In December 1998, Gainax released a compact disc EP featuring mixes of an instrumental Aoki Uru theme by Joujouka, an electronic group consisting at the time of DJ Tsuyoshi (Tsuyoshi Suzuki), Takeshi Isogai, and Minoru Tsunoda. Yamaga, a fan of Tsuyoshi's Goa trance music style, felt that it had the ideal \\"sense of speed and rapturousness\\" for the planned Aoki Uru PlayStation game, and traveled to London to recruit the artist, who was then DJing at the club Return to the Source. In February and September 2000, Gainax released a first and second Aoki Uru Combat Flight Simulator Plane And Mission Module add-on for Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator utilizing plane designs from the staff of the 1992–93 anime project, as well as new ones contributed by artists including Neon Genesis Evangelion mecha designer Ikuto Yamashita, as well as Akira creator Katsuhiro Otomo and Maschinen Krieger creator Kow Yokoyama. The year following the release of the Aoki Uru add-ons for Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator, Gainax announced that Yamaga's next projects would be the TV anime series Mahoromatic and Abenobashi, stating, \\"Hiroyuki Yamaga, as our director, has lurked for 14 years since his last great work, The Wings of Honnêamise.\\" Two months later, however, a report on Gainax from the 40th annual national Japan Science Fiction Convention by Anime News Network indicated that in addition to Gainax having \\"all but confirmed\\" rumors at the event of a sequel to their 1988–89 anime Gunbuster, \\"Hiroyuki Yamaga's follow-up to The Wings of Honnêamise, Blue Uru, which has been in a state of limbo for 8 years now, seems set to be produced. Do not misunderstand, Gainax has not confirmed either of these sequels, but it would seem that they are seriously intent on producing them both.\\" The Gunbuster sequel, Diebuster, would be released by Gainax three years later, in 2004. Uru in Blue (2013–) On March 20, 2013, the opening day of that year's Tokyo International Anime Fair, Gainax displayed a teaser poster for the Aoki Uru film listing Hiroyuki Yamaga as director and screenwriter and Yoshiyuki Sadamoto as character designer. Joined by artist Range Murata, Yamaga and Sadamoto discussed the project during a talk that evening hosted by Osamu Kobayashi at the event space Asagaya Loft A. The following September, Gainax announced on their Facebook page that a pilot film for Aoki Uru would be released in 2014; during his guest appearance in San Mateo, California at the 2013 Japan Expo USA, Sadamoto commented in an interview with Anime News Network, \\"I'd like it to become as great a movie as Honnêamise. The film's main staff may also work on a manga adaptation that will be different from the movie. We're currently looking for business partners for the film.\\" In May 2014, during the Cannes Film Festival, Gainax promoted the film under the English-language title Uru in Blue, as an exhibitor at the Japan External Trade Organization booth. The following December at the Anime Festival Asia event in Singapore, Yamaga indicated that the pilot film, to be called \\"Overture,\\" would be released in 2015 rather than 2014 as previously announced, and that the project was seeking to partner with possible production companies in Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore and the Middle East as well as Japan. Yamaga further related that Uru in Blue would not use the production committee system common to anime, but would instead pursue investors through a limited liability partnership based in Singapore; a budget of US$40 million was projected for the film, on which Yasuhiro Takeda would return to his original role as producer. During a 2015 return visit to FanimeCon, Yamaga detailed the state of Uru in Blue, as well as its changes over time and his perspective on its protracted development: \\"You could almost say the longest part of this process was me finding myself in order to produce this movie...While many people have told me 'you've taken way too long on this project,' I feel like I've put in the perfect amount of time to make the best possible project,\\" although the director also cited the success of Neon Genesis Evangelion as an explanation: \\"I would have liked to have started this project earlier, but the insane popularity of Evangelion spanning across two decades has kept delaying [it].\\" The director exhibited images from the \\"rebooted\\" version of the project; whereas the storyboards of the 1992–93 Aoki Uru proposal had been drawn by Sadamoto and Hideaki Anno, Yamaga displayed new storyboards drawn by himself, in addition to revised designs of the main character drawn by Sadamoto; Yamaga remarked that this protagonist had \\"changed dramatically since the original conception back in 1992.\\" The original Aoki Uru concept was intended to have no characters from Royal Space Force; Yamaga however suggested the possibility of their making cameos in Uru in Blue future setting, although the film would be set in an \\"entirely different nation\\" from the first movie's Kingdom of Honnêamise. Yamaga described a \\"core concept\\" of Uru in Blue being that its main characters \\"are not noble knights, they're ruffians and thugs that come from pretty poor backgrounds\\" who conduct duels on behalf of gambling syndicates using fighter jets acquired as military surplus. The protagonist of the film is a 32 year- old professional duelist; Yamaga related that the character is modeled upon contemporary professionals in the anime industry itself, who \\"sacrifice a lot in their youth and 20s. They break their bodies trying to make anime, and once they start hitting their 30s, they reconsider if it's really worth being paid such a pittance and committing their life's blood, if it's worth doing this for the rest of their life.\\" At the 2015 Fanime panel, Yamaga had characterized traditional methods of anime funding as unprofessional and lacking in standards, and that the inability of Uru in Blue to find financing in Japan had prompted him to seek it in Singapore, as announced there in 2014. During a 2016 appearance at FicZone in Spain, Sadamoto acknowledged that the 2015 release date for Uru \\"Overture\\" pilot film had already passed: \\"As I said before, it's something that depends on money. In this case, I'm really committed to the movie, I just love it. It is a slow process and lack of money is a real problem. Anyway, although I can not say anything about it right now, even if the current director leaves the project, I will stay involved in it.\\" In June 2017, following the loss by Gainax of a lawsuit for delayed royalties brought by Khara, a studio established by former Gainax director Hideaki Anno, Yamaga stated both that Gainax was undergoing restructuring, and that production work had begun on Uru in Blue. In July and August 2018, Gainax's Fukushima branch was acquired by the Kinoshita Group, a conglomerate known largely for its housing and real estate business, but which currently manages the festival Tokyo Filmex, and whose distribution arm, Kino Films, releases around 15 movies yearly. Renamed Gaina, the anime division of the former Fukushima Gainax was relocated to Koganei in Tokyo. The following September, Gaina announced that it would take over production on Uru in Blue, \\"aiming for a worldwide release for the anime in 2022.\\"  Notes   References      Citations  Science fiction anime and manga Upcoming films 2020s Japanese films Japanese films Japanese animated science fiction films Upcoming sequel films Gainax ","title":"Uru in Blue"},{"id":"46558382","title":"Ministry of Foreign Affairs (North Macedonia)"},{"id":"46558416","text":"Rev.

This album is \\"a hard modern take on The Beatles music, incorporating intelligence and technology\\".Franco Mondini, \\"Mina & Beatles: brilla il capolavoro\\", La Stampa del 10 giugno 1993 Mina canta i Beatles features eleven songs, of which only six were recorded in 1993. The remaining five songs were recorded by Mina at various times in her career when she ventured into the Beatles songbook. While the songs do not eclipse the original versions, they are interpreted in classical Mina style with interesting vocal arrangements.Paolo Battigelli, \\"Fabulous Mina\\", Il Resto del Carlino del 10 giugno 1993 The album starts with the track \\"Something\\", Fabrizio Zampa , \\"The Beatles are good at Mina\\", Il Messaggero of 10 June 1993 a song written by George Harrison taken from the iconic Abbey Road (1969), and played here on brushes and flugelhorn. Mina had recorded the song previously in a symphonic version for the album Mina of 1971.

Mina had already recorded the tracks \\"Michelle\\" and \\"My Love\\" on her 1976 album Plurale, \\"She's Leaving Home\\" on her 1980 album Kyrie,http://www.storiaradiotv.it/MINA.htm \\"Hey Jude\\" on her 1984 album Catene and \\"Oh! Darling\\" on her 1989 album Uiallalla. In Mina canta i Beatles, Mina \\"sings as if this were recorded live at a club. The songs are soft and loose, cementing her as a great interpreter without exaggeration or needing to prove that force is the cleverest. The songs are sung with naturalness, a simplicity that, coupled with her vocal abilities, makes for a splendid listening experience\\". The weekly magazine Noi released an article about the album to coincide with the album’s release. The article was written by Mina herself, who is a regularly collaborator of the magazine. The article explains how Mina discovered the music of the Beatles and how she approached the album: When I was younger, if I listened to them no matter the reason or location I was immediately smitten with their music. I did not know who they were initially, but I realized that I was living in a memorable historic event. Like virtually every other person at that stage in music, I was struck by their melodies and lyrics, their music contained a uniformity of emotions, passion all encompassed in a single song. This was at the time really a phenomenon for all and I am sure I was not the only one who experienced this admiration for their music.Mina, \\"I miei Beatles\\", Noi (giugno 1993)  Cover  The album cover is almost a replica of the Revolver album by the Beatles released in 1966. Only instead of Beatles, logically the design of the face of Mina replicated four times. The designs of the face of Mina are taken from the singer's previous covers (starting from 'top left): Sorelle Lumière (Picture inside sleeve), Catene, Minacantalucio, Rane supreme.

He spent his early childhood and schooling there before the family moved to London just before the war. On completing school he studied at the London School of Economics. This was followed by two years of national service in which he was selected for officer training. Having since his early years longed for a community of people within which to work, he sought out, then joined Camphill, Scotland before helping to found the Camphill School in Hermanus, South Africa in 1958. Peter Roth, a priest, flew to South Africa to conduct the service and inspired Sleigh in his endeavour to become a priest himself.Julian Sleigh \\"A Walk Through My Life\\" The Visual Junction, Cape Town The Christian Community In 1963 Sleigh left Camphill to study for the priesthood in Germany and Britain, closely mentored and later accompanied in setting up the work in South Africa by Dr Alfred Heidenreich and Evelyn Francis Derry. After he was ordained in 1965, he returned to South Africa and together with Heinz Maurer, became the founding priest of the Christian Community in Southern Africa. Shortly after this, he and his family moved from Hermanus to set up the first Camphill village, Alpha, that is today the Camphill Village West Coast to the north of Cape Town. Here many of the children with Special Needs that had gone through the Camphill schools could find a home and place to work. At the same time, Sleigh was a priest in the Camphill communities, arranging for a chapel to be built at Alpha. Public engagement, counseling and outreach Through his long association with Vera Grover from the early days in Hermanus, Sleigh joined forces with her in founding the Western Cape Forum for Mental Handicap (today the Western Cape Forum for Intellectual Disability) in an attempt to uplift the quality of life and the awareness of people with special needs more effectively throughout the country. He was the founding chairman from 1971-1985 and the first Honorary Life Member of the Forum.Death Notice Julian Sleigh - Annual Report 2013-2014 Forty Years - 1971-2011 Western Cape Forum for Intellectual Disability Besides this, he was on the Executive of the National Council's (SANC) division for Mental Health and succeeded Grover as chairperson (1980-1984). Soon after its inception in 1968, through his friendship with Rosemary van Niekerk, Western Cape Secretary of Lifeline South Africa, the telephone counseling service, Sleigh took the training as counsellor with Rev. Peter Storey. Lifeline had been founded in Australia in 1963 by Sir Alan Walker, using the counseling psychology and techniques developed by Carl Rogers and there are now centres in many different countries. Sleigh worked there as a volunteer for many years and helped set up the training together with Alan Hardie after the transfer of Peter Storey to Johannesburg as a Methodist bishop and inspired his book Crisis Points. From 1968 onwards, beginning with the resettlement of former residents from District Six, the coloured township of Atlantis began to develop close to the Camphill village. Sleigh realised that facilities for the inevitable Special Needs requirements that are present in every community would have to be developed there. So he started the project that was, in time, to be taken over by Veronica Jackson and later by Mellville Segal, who wrote the book Turn Right At Magnolia Street to commemorate these experiences. Both had been long time co-workers of Camphill. They named the project Orion and it continues to function independently today under the name Orion Friendship Organisation.Orion in South Africa II Melville Segal in Camphill Correspndence May/June 2006Orion - Executive Annual Report: 2006Homepage Orion Friendship Organisation Eulogy by the Rev.

It is a Moody's Analytics company. Orbis is Bureau van Dijk's flagship company database.

The company has over 5,000 clients including banks, insurance companies, financial and consulting organisations, governments and research institutes. Bureau van Dijk claims to offer the most powerful comparable resource of information on private companies in the world. The company brand statement is \\"The Business of Certainty\\". The company regularly blogs content and white papers, offering free resources on compliance and other risk areas. History The origin of Bureau van Dijk dates back to the 1970s. Belgian businessman Marcel van Dijk established a company specialising in documentary and information systems, named \\"Bureau Marcel van Dijk\\". In 1972, its activities were further deployed in the two companies established in Paris and Brussels. In 1985, on the retirement of Marcel van Dijk, Professor Bernard van Ommeslaghe and Alain Liedts took over the company and extended its operations to include management consulting, auditing and IT support. In 1987, Bureau van Dijk took the pioneering role in Europe by launching a new activity: the design and dissemination on CD-ROM (the precursor to Bureau van Dijk's online databases) of economic and financial databases with information on companies. In 1991, a second company, \\"Bureau van Dijk Electronic Publishing\\", was formed to assume responsibility for updating and expanding these databases, while the consulting division remained grouped within the company Bureau van Dijk Ingénieurs Conseils. The owners of Bureau van Dijk were private individuals who were also members of the management and board, and the company has since been sold. Candover acquired a 60% stake in Bureau van Dijk in 2004 after founder and chairman Bernard Van Ommeslaghe, who was 70, decided to sell part. The other 40% was then thought to be owned by the management. Bureau van Dijk was then sold to Charterhouse Capital Partners in July 2011, backed with 505 million euros of leveraged loans, including 365 million euros of senior loans and 140 million euros of mezzanine debt maturing in 2019. In July 2014, EQT Partners purchased Bureau van Dijk from Charterhouse backed by an 845 million-euro equivalent leveraged loan financing. In early 2015, Swedish pension fund Sjätte AP-fonden (AP6) bought a 3% stake in Bureau van Dijk, through a direct co-investment. In May 2017, Moody's Analytics announced its intention to buy the company for 3 billion euros, which was completed in August 2017. Products Bureau van Dijk offers a range of products/databases which focus on corporate finance and mergers and acquisitions (M&A;), transfer pricing, compliance and third party due diligence, procurement and supplier risk, credit risk, academic research and business development.

Bureau van Dijk sources the information from over 160 different providers and states that it adds value to this information as it standardises the data and links the sources together. A study by the University of Amsterdam's CORPNET group published in 2017 in Nature used the Orbis database to analyse over 98 million global corporate connections to investigate tax havens and offshore financial centre (OFCs); resulting in new classifications of Conduit and Sink OFCs.

FVG has abundant supplies of Methane as that is a by-product of their large-scale palm oil production. They aim to achieve synergy through the relationship with Cambridge Nanosystems whose technology will enable that waste material to be turned into valuable Graphene. In December 2014, Cambridge Nanosystems was awarded £500,000 from the UK's Technology Strategy Board in order to increase capacity of their material. The funds were used to develop a manufacturing facility in Cambridge with the capability of producing up to 100 tonnes of Graphene a year for the European market. FGV and Cambridge Nanosystems are planning to build another plant in Malaysia to supply the Asian market.

The organisation was established in 2014. The organisation partners with other Non-governmental organisations to uplift thousands of Indian Women and Children who are denied basic rights. It works towards restoring basic rights to Women and Children, especially from India and works across levels from direct action to advocacy, mobilising public opinion and policy change. It was started by Gururaj and Ashwath in 2014. The organisation is now growing, and by the end of 2018 the organisation has plans to expand working in few other states for their upcoming projects in rural, semi-urban and urban areas. Noble Cause Foundation has set up a two-tier network of over 75 primary and 125 secondary volunteers spread across 27 districts of Karnataka and interacts with over 2500 older persons on monthly basis through its volunteers’ network. It focuses mainly on the 4 basic rights of survival, development, protection and participation which were defined by the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), international human rights treaty which has been ratified by 192 countriesUN Child Rights Convention and 4 out of the 7 basic principles defined by UN WOMEN, a United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of WomenUN Women Basic principles(Children's Rights) The CRC is built on certain \\"foundation principles\\" that underpin all other children's rights. The NCRC confers the following basic rights on all children across the world, without discrimination: *the right to survival, to life, health, nutrition, name and nationality, *the right to development of education, care, leisure, and recreation, *the right to protection from exploitation, abuse and neglect, *the right to participation in expression, information, thought and religion. NCF works to ensure these rights to all categories of children, who could be street children, children bonded in labor, children of commercial sex workers, physically and mentally challenged children and children in juvenile institutions, or even children in privileged homes. Basic principles(Women Empowerment) *Ensure the health, safety and well-being of all women workers, *Promote education, training and professional development for women, *Implement enterprise development, supply chain and marketing practices that empower women, *Promote equality through community initiatives and advocacy. History In 2014, seven friends made a simple decision to change the lives of India's underprivileged women & children. With USD 50 and a dining table as their resources and a belief that each one can make a difference in under privileged women's & children's life. This was how NCF began.  Registration under different statutes  The Foundation is Registered with the Charity Commissioner/Sub Registrar as a Trust in Bengaluru. The Foundation has applied for registration of its Logo and Trade Mark with the Trade Marks Registry. The Foundation is registered under Income Tax Act under section 12AA and under section 80G.

Mission To identify and work alongside the economically and socially deprived, so that they become educated, skilled and aware. Enable them to be self-reliant and enjoy a healthy, dignified and sustainable quality of life To enable people to take responsibility for the situation of the deprived Indian child and so motivate them to confront the situation through collective action thereby giving the child and themselves an opportunity to realise their full potential. To work in partnership with individuals and organisations, and support them financially / non-financially as well as with people from all walks of life, who believe in the rights of children. Within NCF too, each function works in unison towards ensuring the vision of equal rights for all children. Vision To enable people to take responsibility for the situation of the deprived Indian child and so motivate them to confront the situation through collective action thereby giving the child and themselves an opportunity to realise their full potential. To work in partnership with individuals and organisations, and support them financially / non-financially as well as with people from all walks of life, who believe in the rights of children. Within NCF too, each function works in unison towards ensuring the vision of equal rights for all children. Areas of work The key functions of Development Support (grant making) and Resource Mobilisation (fundraising) along with the other support functions - Communications, Human Resources, Youth and Volunteer action, Finance, Planning and Information Technology, Documentation - all play a critical role in the organisation building efforts. It works towards restoring basic rights to women and children, especially from India and works across levels from direct action to advocacy, mobilising public opinion and policy change. It focuses mainly on the four basic rights of survival, development, protection and participation which were defined by the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. The CRC is built on certain \\"foundation principles\\" that underpin all other children's rights. NCF’s approach works through a three-phase engagement: * First, NCF chooses to work in areas where the human development indicators are the worst in the country – seeking out the most marginalised communities and their children. It examines the situation of the children in these communities in a holistic manner, covering the entire gamut of issues that affect them. *NCF then seeks to understand the root causes of the deprivation faced by children in education. In India, the root causes that prevent children from accessing their rights often tend to be: * i) gender- or caste-based discrimination in the home, the community or in school, * ii) the lack of adequate livelihoods for the adults, forcing them to make their children work as child labourers, or * iii) forced displacement that forces families to migrate, and also pushes children to drop out of school. Finally, NCF mobilise the local community to find long-term solutions to these root causes by making sure that the laws and policies that guarantee their rights are actually implemented. NCF started work on empowering under-privileged women & children and the communities they belonged to by actively partnering grassroots-level NGOs working in remote and neglected areas of India. These organisations are trained to mobilise rural and urban communities to access their entitlements through collective action. The process of building the community-based collectives entail educating and informing the rural poor about their entitlements to education as given by the Government under the relevant Acts and Schemes; and enabling them to demand these entitlements from the local government.

Amarapedia is inspired by the Welsh experience of Monmouthpedia and it was a pilot project for future larger-scale projects that took place in the city of Donostia-San Sebastián in 2016, when the city was the European Capital of Culture.  Inception  The idea of Amarapedia was conceived by active cultural members and Wikipedians of San Sebastián. The initial goal is to encourage the citizens' involvement in an inclusive way through articles about the quarter of Amara and its neighborhood. This is a continuation of the work done with associations of the neighbourhood within Amarauna project (this word means \\"net\\" in the Basque language), and is one of the starting points of the citywide Donostiapedia project. Amarapedia was developed during 2015, and was featured in the local Olatu Talka cultural festival on 30 May of that year, in Mentxu Gal square in Amara. The intention is to involve the citizens of Donostia-San Sebastián in the writing of as many articles as possible in Basque, which will be translated into Spanish afterwards, until December 2015. Free courses on editing Wikipedia have been provided in the locality. Finally, 11 articles will be selected and published as Amarapedia's Essentials, which will be translated into many languages.  Main aims  # To expand the information of the quarter: sharing knowledge and promoting local identity. # To promote Wikipedia in the Basque language. # To support an active community and to empower civic participation. # To provide a thrilling pilot experience for the year 2016. # To engage local associations and encourage working together. QR technology The Amarapedia project, like Monmouthpedia, will make use of QR technology: neighbours and visitors will be able to access Amarapedia articles using QR codes. Readers will see the articles in their own language, determined by the configuration of their smartphones; and visually impaired people will be able to listen to the articles using the accessibility features of their smartphones. Additionally, it will be possible for anyone to improve, update and translate the articles due to the collaborative nature of Wikipedia.

It depicts a world before the events depicted in the film. The show began its development in Montreal, Quebec, and then moved in August 2015 to the CenturyLink Center in Bossier City, Louisiana, where rehearsals took place until the show premiered. The CenturyLink Center was chosen because the massive set of the show did not fit in the Cirque du Soleil studios in Montreal. Plot The translation for the official teaser trailer from the constructed Na'vi language is the following: \\"I am the last living member of the Anurai clan. When I connect with Eywa, I hear the voices of our distant ancestors; I hear the time when their lives were threatened. This is that story.\\" Toruk is the central character of the show, and is brought to life as a life-sized puppet, along with Pandoran animals such as the Direhorse, the Austrapede, the Turtapede, and a Viperwolf. Production The Pandoran animals are brought to life through large-scale puppetry. Toruk itself is a 'reverse string puppet' (handled from the base) while the Austrapede, Turtapede and Direhorse are 'lived-in puppets' (someone is inside) and the Viperwolf is an 'in-view puppet' (the lower half of the puppeteer is outside, becoming a part of the puppet, while his/her upper body is inside the puppet). The set of Toruk is made of inflated rubber and steel, making the huge set easier to transport from city to city. Reception The Chicago Tribune praised the show's production values saying that \\"The designers of this piece — a group including Carl Fillion, Patrick Martel, Kym Barrett, Alain Lortie — combine with other superb artists to create the eye-popping landscape of the world of the 'Omatikaya,' ... all making stunning use of the still-new ability to project very high-quality graphics over any surface, however large. Not only does that include the entire floor of the United Center, but the audience as well. For some folks in your life, especially fans of Avatar or of high- graphics gaming, such design and tech wizardry will likely be more than enough.\\" The review also said \\"Boring is not the word for this show — too much greets the eye. But your soul won't ache for humanity.\\" NZME wrote that \\"The play succeeds and fails in the same ways as the film did... While everything was ridiculously impressive to look at, the pacing felt off and the story simply wasn't intriguing enough to justify it.\\" The National wrote that \\"It is true Toruk is not full of the heart-stopping acrobatics that defined previous shows. But the thrill is replaced with heart; the environmentalist message coursing through the show is delivered by the soulful performances of the dancers whose facial expressions run the gamut from hope and joy to fear and ultimately resilience.\\" BroadwayWorld wrote \\"Overall I would recommend this show to people who would appreciate a story-telling art piece that's visually very appealing. But to the Cirque du Soleil-admirers who prefer some more action like a Ká/Zumanity/O vegas-show, they will be disappointed because the energy level is at an immensely low point.\\" Gulf News wrote that the show \\"is a visually ambitious piece of entertainment, with 40 projectors creating a world that feels alive — movements, sounds and scents included ... Overall, the show does not occupy itself with continuous acrobatic acts that will leave your heart lodged in your throat. Instead, it lends itself to onstage transformations, where the expansive world of Avatar is re-explored in the flesh.\\" Acrobatic Acts Toruk features 5 speciality acrobatic acts and general tumbling skills in order to capture the other worldly skills of the inhabitants of Pandora. Each tribe has their own unique apparatus and discipline, reflecting their tribal values and skills which Entu and Ralu will need to learn in order to tame Toruk. The following lists the acts, correct as of the first Asia Pacific Tour. Several acts were added following the premier of Toruk, and hence are not included in the official DVD recording. Those featured at the premier (and on the DVD are in italics): *Tumbling: The young members of the Omaticaya Clan play a unique ball game in which points are scored by diving through giant hoop structures whilst carrying a glowing orb. All the meanwhile the clan members are jumping off and around the surroundings of the Hometree. *Mother Loom/Spanish Webs: The Omaticaya Clan performers perform tricks on an angled grid frame in the centre of the hometree. On either side of the loom a performers climb and slide down Spanish Webs. *Aerial Straps: Entu seeks refuge at the Tree of Voices, swinging on the straps, the tree's branches, to seek comfort from his deceased parents after falling during his initiation ceremony, breaking his ceremonial bow and failing the task. *Aerial Silks: Tsyal climbs up the silk, the stem of the giant flower in the centre of the Tawakami tribe to reach the Tranquil Seed, one of the sacred objects to Entu and Ralu's quest. *Contortion/Hand Balancing: Members of the Anurai Clan demonstrate their balancing skills by manoeuvring over a skeleton (resembling that of Toruk) which is fixed only by a pivot in the middle, tipping and turning all the while. *Chinese Poles: The Tipani, specialists in weaponry, demonstrate their attacking skills on swinging Chinese poles, shaped like spears. *Kites/Boomerang: Nearing their final goal of reaching Toruk, the trio reach the Kekunan Tribe, specialists in flying. Performers manipulate kites, shaped like the wings of the Toruk, whilst one Kekunan throws glowing, three sided boomerangs around the central platform before catching them again, much like horizontal juggling.

Developed at Bath Film Festival in 2014, the F-rating was inspired by the Bechdel Test based on a 1985 cartoon strip by Alison Bechdel, and popularised in the 2010s by Anita Sarkeesian's Feminist Frequency blog, and by Ellen Tejle's A-ratingA-rating in Swedish cinemas. In response to criticisms of the A-rating, Swedish film theorists Ingrid Ryberg, Anu Koivunen and Laura Horak wrote, \\"The A rating has proved to be an activist provocation that works, and it is important to ask why... The A rating is not about classifying films as feminist or not feminist. It aims to alert viewers who find female sociality compelling to films they might like, and so challenge the industry to make more such films.\\" The festival developed the F-rating in October 2014 \\"to take it a step further and highlight films which either had a senior figure in production who was female—a director or a screenwriter—or had very strong female leads or women's issues,\\" according to festival director and F-rating founder Holly Tarquini. Tarquini told the BBC that films had to meet at least one of three criteria to receive the rating: \\"If our films have a female director, a female lead who is not simply there to support the male lead, or are specifically about women then they will receive an F-rated stamp of approval.\\" In 2016, the F-rated founder, Holly Tarquini was invited to deliver a TED talk at TEDxYouth@Bath. Rationale The F-rating is a reaction to a phenomenon known as the celluloid ceiling, which has been documented internationally. \\"BFI figures showed that in 2011, 15% of all UK films released were directed by women, but in 2012, this went down to 7.8%.\\", while a study by \\"the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film at San Diego State University found females made up 15 per cent of protagonists, 29 per cent of major characters and 30 per cent of all speaking characters in the 100 top-grossing films of 2013.\\" Bath Film Festival 2014: first implementation Seventeen of the forty-two films received the F-rating, included the First World War drama Testament of Youth, based on Vera Brittain’s memoir, and director Jean-Marc Vallée's true-life tale Wild, starring Reese Witherspoon. Women's magazines Marie Claire and Elle both gave positive coverage to the rating and programme, which were also mentioned in UK Culture Minister Ed Vaizey's weekly bulletin. Subsequent implementation In February 2015, the Bath Comedy Festival announced that it would be the UK's first F-rated comedy festival, with performers including Viv Groskop and Helen Lederer. In March 2015, Komedia Bath arranged a meeting to encourage all Bath festivals, including the Bath Festival of Children's Literature and Bath International Music Festival, and arts organisations to make Bath the first F-rated city. The 2015 Bath Film Festival programme was 45% F-rated, and attracted more attention. In 2015, all the independent cinemas and film festivals in the UK were invited to join the F-rating with dozens signing up to F-rated their programme. In 2016, The Barbican became the 40th organisation to adopt the rating. F-rated keyword added to IMDb In January 2017, the F-rated keyword was added to IMDb. By March 2017, there were over 22,400 films on IMDb tagged with the F-rated keyword. The rating was defended by GQ Magazine.

When exercising these rights, there must be proper recognition of the rights of others and to the community as a whole.Section 16(2) of the Constitution of Tokelau, 2007. If an individual believes their rights have been breached they may go to the Council for the Ongoing Government who may make any appropriate order to protect that individual’s rights.Sections 3-6 of the Constitution of Tokelau, 2007. There have been no such complaints to date. International treaties Tokelau currently recognises itself as a part of New Zealand under the Tokelau Act 1948.Section 3 of the Tokelau Act 1948 Because of this, Tokelau has a limited international legal personality. In regards to international treaties, ratification is done by the New Zealand Government who extends their authority to include Tokelau by an express statement once the Government of Tokelau has been consulted.International Treaty Making Guide If Tokelau were to become a state in free association with New Zealand, then they would have the capacity to ratify treaties under their own name. There have been two referenda attempts in Tokelau to move to self-government. These occurred in 2006 and in 2007, however there was not enough required support for Tokelau to change its status. Treaties that apply to Tokelau include the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), its two optional protocols, the Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), the United Nations Convention Against Torture, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) and the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD). An example of a treaty that New Zealand has ratified but does not apply to Tokelau is the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC). Tokelau also participates in some regional organisations with New Zealand's support. These include the Secretariat of the Pacific Community, the Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency, the Pacific Regional Environment Programme, the Council of the University of the South Pacific and the UN Educational and Scientific Organisation. Overview of Tokelauan human rights Human rights were not mentioned in Tokelauan legislation until the Human Rights Rules 2004. These rules were very basic and are now what is incorporated in the Constitution of Tokelau 2007. Tokelau accepts the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The right to education The right to an education is found in Article 26 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Article 13 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR). The Constitution of Tokelau gives no indication to the meaning of each individual right, therefore the ICESCR can be used to define what the right to education actually means. The ICESCR goes into some detail on what the right to education entails. It states all primary education should be free and compulsory. Secondary education should be generally available and accessible to all, as should any higher education. It then goes on to say there needs to be development in school systems that are free from discrimination, with set minimum standards and a high level of quality. Tokelau conforms with its human rights obligations in that up to the age of 16 years, education is free, and under s63 of the Crimes, Procedure and Evidence Rules 2003, school is compulsory until the age of 16. There are three schools across the three atolls, all of whom teach from early childhood up to year 11. Year 12 and 13 students are offered foundation and transition courses.Education in Tokelau. There is no university in Tokelau, so if students wish to progress to further education, they need to either study via correspondence or relocate to another country such as Samoa. New Zealand conducted an educational review of Tokelau in February 2014, and found \\"the overall quality of teaching does not enable all Tokelauan students to achieve the education standards outlined in the Tokelau National Curriculum Policy Framework\\".National Evaluation of Education Provision in Tokelau Conducted by the NZ Government at page 11. The same report went on to find that none of the schools were well resourced in facilities and teaching materials.Evaluation of Education Provision in Tokelau Conducted by the NZ Government at page 15. In the Annex to the National Report of the Universal Periodic Review, it was acknowledged in the section on Tokelau that it is highly challenging to recruit and retain qualified and skilled teachers in the education sector in Tokelau. This is because Tokelau is so isolated from other countries. The right to an adequate standard of living The right to an adequate standard of living under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is there for the health and well being of individuals and their families. This includes having access to medical care, food, clothing and housing. The right to healthcare There are three hospitals in Tokelau, one is located on each of the three atolls. They are the primary healthcare facilities for Tokelauan residents. Each hospital has 12 beds, none of which have the capacity for intensive care patients. In the case of serious injuries patients have to be evacuated to Samoa and in some cases to New Zealand.World Health Organization: Tokelau Health Profile. Tokelau ensures they are adhering to Article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in regards to access to healthcare by making all dental and medical services free to the citizens of Tokelau. This includes the prescription of essential medicines. Where a person is required to go to Samoa for healthcare the Tokelauan Government provides a subsidy.World Health Organisation: Tokelau Health Profile at page 5. New Zealand’s National Report for the Universal Periodic Review provides a section on Tokelau which states that statistical information in regards to the health levels of Tokelauan’s is unavailable making it difficult to understand the status of health issues such as obesity and disease rates. The report also outlined Tokelau’s biggest challenge in providing health care is attracting medically trained staff to come and work in Tokelau. This challenge was largely attributed to being so isolated from other countries. The World Health Organisation has recognised that the flow on effects from having recruitment issues has led to health workers having to run the hospital and become accountable for a vast amount of high level duties.World Health Organisation: Tokelau Health Profile at page 11. The right to water and sanitation The right to water is recognised under ICESCR which is recognised in the Constitution of Tokelau and also CEDAW, to which Tokelau is a party. Tokelau has very scarce water resources and because there are no fresh water surfaces on any of the atolls, it is solely dependent on rainwater as its source of fresh water. In recent years, climate change has resulted in much lower rain levels with drought periods lasting for much longer. This has made Tokelau along with many other islands in the Pacific struggle to conserve and store water for individual use.Improving rainwater harvesting infrastructure in Tokelau at page 1. In the past, countries such as New Zealand and the United States have had to send emergency water supplies to Tokelau because it was on the verge of running out entirely. Sanitation facilities are also said to be poorly designed and wasting precious supplies of fresh water through the flushing system.Improving rainwater harvesting infrastructure in Tokelau at page 6. Due to Tokelau being a New Zealand territory and not an independent, it was unable to take advantage of the Pacific Adaption to Climate Change (PACC) programme when it was introduced in 2009. In 2011 that Australian Government supplied additional funding allowing for what was known as the PACC+ programme that Tokelau was allowed to be a part of. Since 2011, the Tokelau PACC+ project has been progressively working towards more sustainable solutions in regards to rainwater harvesting and storage to ensure that everyone in Tokelau can continue to have access to what is consider a basic right. The right to a fair trial The Crimes, Procedure and Evidence Rules (CPER) 2003 sets out Tokelau's criminal code. Part II of the CPER and onwards sets out numerous sections all in relation to trial circumstances and processes for both criminal and civil trials. According to the Annex of the National Report, the rules set out are all consistent with and set out to satisfy Tokelau's fair trial obligations.Annex to the National Report: Tokelau at para 25.

The young quintet have released three albums to rave critics, two EP's, and have played more than 300 concerts in Europe/Asia. Combining classical and folk music with pop and rock they have played several sold out headliner tours and festivals. Einar Stray Orchestra is influenced by bands such as Sufjan Stevens, Bright Eyes, and Godspeed You! Black Emperor. History Einar Stray started recording songs in his bedroom in Sandvika, a little town located in the south west of Oslo in 2006 and uploaded them to Myspace. As an experimental singer/songwriter he brought musician friends with him on stage, and together they produced music both delicate and grandiose with strings, blows, percussion, choir parts, noisy guitars, and a classical inspired piano style - counting 11 band members at its most. After meeting the Norwegian artist Moddi in 2008, they quickly joined forces and released their debut EPs together, as a split-vinyl. \\"Favors And Fields/Rubato EP\\" resulted in their first tour through Norway, including big festivals like Slottsfjell, By:larm and Øya. Moddi and Einar has appeared in each other's bands ever since. In 2011, the band got compressed into a five-piece, and released their debut album, Chiaroscuro, in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Japan and Norway of which Terese Blåklokke did the artwork. With a range from noisy post-rock ballads to stripped down a cappella songs the band toured all of 2012, and gave also birth to \\"For The Country EP\\". They ended the year opening for Múm and Under Byen in Russia. The second album Politricks was released in 2014 which had been rated by The Line of Best Fit as following: “There's so much going on that it's difficult to glean much upon initial listens – it's probably a little alienating, but if you do manage to persevere and penetrate the gloopy outer shell, you'll be rewarded with an opulent, everchanging chimera of a record.” It was Simen Sandbæk Skari of the band Team Me who did the artwork of this cover. In May 2015 the band announced that they are working on their third album, coming out in 2016.

Belek's head is being brandished by the besiegers. Belek Ghazi (Nuruddevle Belek or Balak) was a Turkish bey in the early 12th century. Early life His father was Behram and his grandfather was Artuk, an important figure of the Seljuk Empire in the 11th century. He was a short-term governor of Suruç (now a district center in Şanlıurfa Province of Turkey). During the First Crusade, the crusaders captured the city in 1098. He took part in the Seljuk expedition to Antakya which was recently lost to Crusaders. But the campaign ended in failure. Beylik in Harput In 1112 Belek captured Harput (an ancient city near to present day Elâzığ in Turkey) from Mengüceks.(The beylik of Mengüceks was an early Anatolian beylik). He founded a beylik.Yücel-Yaşar, p.167 This beylik is now known as the Harput branch of the Artukids (the other two being the Hasankeyf branch of Sökmen and Mardin branch of Ilghazi). Next year he married to Ayşe Hatun, widow of Anatolian Seljuk sultan Kılıç Arslan I. By this prestigious marriage, he formed family ties with the Seljuk family.Belek Gazi In 1120, Belek together with Danishmends defeated a coalition of Mengüceks and Constantine Gabras of the Byzantine Empire.Yücel-Yaşar,p.153 Two years later, after the death of Ilghazi, Belek became the leader of the Artukids.Yücel Yaşar, p168 In 1122 he defeated the forces of the County of Edessa and took Joscelin I as captive. The next year, Baldwin II of Jerusalem too was captured by Belek. These two victories gained Belek fame both in Muslim countries and in Europe. From 1123-1124, Belek served as emir of Aleppo. Death and aftermath In 1124 he was invited to defend Tyre, the only port the Muslims used in Syria against the attacking Crusaders. During the fighting he was killed on 6 May 1124. Shortly after his death Harput was annexed by the Artukids of Hasankeyf. Nevertheless, in 1185 another beylik was founded by Artukids in Harput.

It is estimated that millions of child deaths could be prevented every year if the non-specific effects of vaccines were taken into consideration in immunization programs. Non-specific effects of vaccines (also called \\"heterologous effects\\" or \\"off-target effects\\") are effects which go beyond the specific protective effects against the targeted diseases. Non-specific effects can be strongly beneficial by increasing protection against non-targeted infections. This has been shown with two live attenuated vaccines, BCG vaccine and measles vaccine, through multiple randomized controlled trials. Theoretically, non-specific effects of vaccines may be detrimental, increasing overall mortality despite providing protection against the target diseases. Although observational studies suggest that diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine (DTP) may be detrimental, these studies are at high risk of bias and have failed to replicate when conducted by independent groups. Ongoing research suggests that non-specific effects of vaccines may depend on the vaccine, the vaccination schedule, and the sex of the infant. For example, one hypothesis suggests that all live attenuated vaccines reduce mortality more than explained by prevention fo target infections, while all inactivated vaccines may increase overall mortality despite providing protection against the target disease. These effects may be long-lasting, at least up to the time point where a new type of vaccine is given. The non-specific effects can be very pronounced, with significant effects on overall mortality and morbidity. In a situation with herd immunity to the target disease, the non-specific effects can be more important for overall health than the specific vaccine effects. The non-specific effects should not be confused with the side effects of vaccines (such as local reactions at the site of vaccination or general reactions such as fever, head ache or rash, which usually resolve within days to weeks – or in rare cases anaphylaxis). Rather, non-specific effects represent a form of general immunomodulation, with important consequences for the immune system's ability to handle subsequent challenges. It is estimated that millions of child deaths in low income countries could be prevented every year if the non-specific effects of vaccines were taken into consideration in immunization programs. History The Bandim Health Project Office built in 2008. The hypothesis that vaccines have non-specific effects was formulated in the early 1990s by Peter Aaby at the Bandim Health Project in West Africa. The first indication of the importance of the non-specific effects of vaccines came in a series of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in the late 1980s. It was tested whether a high-titer (high-dose) measles vaccine (HTMV) given at 4–6 months of age was as effective against measles infection as the standard measles vaccine (MV) given at 9 months of age. Early administration of the HTMV prevented measles infection just as effectively as did the standard MV given at 9 months of age. However, early administration of the HTMV was associated with twofold higher overall mortality among females (there was no difference in mortality for males). In other words, the girls given HTMV died more often despite having the same protection against measles as the infants given standard MV. The discovery forced WHO to withdraw the HTMV in 1992. It was later discovered that it was not the HTMV, but rather a subsequent inactivated vaccine (DTP or IPV for different children), that caused the increase in female mortality. Although the mechanism was different than initially thought, this finding represents unexpected effects of a change in the vaccine program not attributable to the disease-specific protection provided by the vaccines. This first observation that vaccines could protect against the target disease but at the same time affect mortality after infection with other pathogens, in a sex-differential manner, led to several further studies showing that other vaccines might also have such nonspecific effects. Live attenuated versus inactivated vaccines Numerous observational studies and randomised trials (RCTs) have found that the impact on mortality of live and inactivated vaccines differ markedly. All live vaccines studied so far (BCG, measles vaccine, oral polio vaccine (OPV) and smallpox vaccine) have been shown to reduce mortality more than can be explained by prevention of the targeted infection(s). In contrast, inactivated vaccines (diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP), hepatitis B, inactivated polio vaccine) may have deleterious effects in spite of providing target disease protection. BCG vaccine The live attenuated BCG vaccine developed against tuberculosis has been shown to have strong beneficial effects on the ability to combat non-tuberculosis infections. Scar after BCG vaccination Several studies have suggested that BCG vaccination may reduce atopy, particularly when given early in life. Furthermore, in multiple observational studies BCG vaccination has been shown to provide beneficial effects on overall mortality. These observations encouraged randomised controlled trials to examine BCG vaccination's beneficial non-specific effects on overall health. Since BCG vaccination is recommended to be given at birth in countries that have a high incidence of tuberculosis it would have been unethical to randomize children into 'BCG' vs. 'no BCG' groups. However, many low-income countries delay BCG vaccination for low-birth-weight (LBW) infants; this offered the opportunity to directly test the effect of BCG on overall mortality. In the first two randomised controlled trials receipt of BCG+OPV at birth vs. OPV only ('delayed BCG') was associated with strong reductions in neonatal mortality; these effects were seen as early as 3 days after vaccination. BCG protected against sepsis as well as respiratory infections. Among BCG vaccinated children, those who develop a BCG scar or a positive skin test (TST) are less likely to develop sepsis and exhibit an overall reduction in child mortality of around 50%. In a recent WHO-commissioned review based on five clinical trials and nine observational studies, it was concluded that \\"the results indicated a beneficial effect of BCG on overall mortality in the first 6–12 months of life. Relevant follow-up in some of the trials was short, and all of the observational studies were regarded as being at risk of bias, so the confidence in the findings was rated as very low according to the GRADE criteria and \\"There was a suggestion that BCG vaccination may be more beneficial the earlier it is given\\". Furthermore, \\"estimated effects are in the region of a halving of mortality risk\\" and \\"any effect of BCG vaccine on all-cause mortality is not likely to be attributable to any great extent to fewer deaths from tuberculosis (i.e. to a specific effect of BCG vaccine against tuberculosis)\\". Based on the evidence, the WHO's Strategic Group of Experts on Immunization concluded that \\"the non-specific effects on all-cause mortality warrant further research\\". Measles vaccine Standard titer measles vaccine is recommended at 9 months of age in low-income countries where measles infection is endemic and often fatal. Many observational studies have shown that measles-vaccinated children have substantially lower mortality than can be explained by the prevention of measles-related deaths. Many of these observational studies were natural experiments, such as studies comparing the mortality before and after the introduction of measles vaccine and other studies where logistical factors rather than maternal choice determined whether a child was vaccinated or not. These findings were later supported in randomized trials from 2003 to 2009 in Guinea-Bissau. An intervention group of children given standard titer measles vaccine at 4.5 and 9 month of age had a 30% reduction in all-cause mortality compared to the children in the control group, which were only vaccinated against measles at 9 month of age. In a recent WHO-commissioned review based on four randomized trials and 18 observational studies, it was concluded that \\"There was consistent evidence of a beneficial effect of measles vaccine, although all observational studies were assessed as being at risk of bias and the GRADE rating was of low confidence. There was an apparent difference between the effect in girls and boys, with girls benefitting more from measles vaccination\\", and furthermore \\"estimated effects are in the region of a halving of mortality risk\\" and \\"if these effects are real then they are not fully explained by deaths that were established as due to measles\\". Based on the evidence, the WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization concluded that \\"the non-specific effects on all-cause mortality warrant further research\\". Diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine DTP vaccine against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis does not seem to have the same beneficial effects as BCG, measles vaccine, OPV and smallpox vaccine, and in fact opposite effects are observed. The negative effects are seen as long as DTP vaccine is the most recent vaccine. BCG or measles vaccine given after DTP reverses the negative effects of DTP. The negative effects are seen mostly in females. The negative effects are found in several observational studies. However, six WHO-commissioned studies concluded that there were strong beneficial effects of DTP on overall mortality. However, controversy ensued as these studies had important methodological shortcomings. For example, the WHO- commissioned studies had counted \\"no information about vaccination\\" as \\"unvaccinated\\", and they had retrospectively updated vaccine information from surviving children, while no similar update could be made for dead children, creating a so-called \\"survival bias\\" which will always produce highly beneficial effect estimates for the most recent vaccine. In a recent WHO- commissioned review of DTP based on ten observational studies, it was concluded that, \\"the findings were inconsistent, with a majority of the studies indicating a detrimental effect of DTP, and two studies indicating a beneficial effect. All of the studies were regarded as being at risk of bias, so the confidence in the findings was rated as very low according to the GRADE criteria.\\" Furthermore, \\"three observational studies provided a suggestion that simultaneous administration of BCG and DTP may be preferable to the recommended schedule of BCG before DTP; and there was suggestion that mortality risk may be higher when DTP is given with, or after, measles vaccine compared with when it is given before measles vaccine (from five, and three, observational studies, respectively). These results are consistent with hypotheses that DTP vaccine may have detrimental effects on mortality, although a majority of the evidence was generated by a group centred in Guinea-Bissau who have often written in defence of such a hypothesis.\\" Smallpox vaccine When smallpox vaccine was introduced in the early 19th century, there were anecdotal descriptions of non-specific beneficial effects. In the second half of the 20th century the potential for beneficial non- specific effects of smallpox vaccine was reviewed, and new evidence on \\"para- immune effects\\" was added. More recent studies have focused on the phasing out of smallpox vaccine in the 1970s and compared vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts. Smallpox vaccine leaves a very characteristic scar. In low-income countries, having a smallpox vaccine scar has been associated with reductions of more than 40% in overall mortality among adults; in high-income countries smallpox vaccination has been associated with a tendency for reduced risk of asthma, and significantly reduced risk of malignant melanoma and infectious disease hospitalizations. There are no studies that contradict these observations. However no randomized trials testing the effect of smallpox vaccine on overall mortality and morbidity have been conducted. Sex differences Non-specific effects are frequently different in males and females. There are accumulating data illustrating that males and females may respond differently to vaccination, both in terms of the quality and quantity of the immune response. If true, then we must consider whether vaccination schedules should differ for males and females, or as has been suggested \\"should we treat the sexes differently in order to treat them equally?\\" Interactions between health interventions The non-specific effects of vaccines can be boosted or diminished when other immunomodulating health interventions such as other vaccines, or vitamins, are provided. Influence of pre-existing specific immunity The beneficial NSEs of live vaccines are stronger with earlier vaccination, possibly due to maternal antibodies. Boosting with live vaccines also seems to enhance the beneficial effects. High-income countries The non-specific effects were primarily observed in low-income countries with high infectious disease burdens, but they may not be limited to these areas. Recent Danish register-based studies have shown that the live attenuated measles-mumps-rubella vaccine (MMR) protects against hospital admissions with infectious diseases and specifically getting ill by respiratory syncytial virus. Immunological mechanisms The findings from the epidemiological studies on the non-specific effects of vaccines pose a challenge to the current understanding of vaccines, and how they affect the immune system, and also question whether boys and girls have identical immune systems and should receive the same treatment. The mechanisms for these effects are unclear. It is not known how vaccination induces rapid beneficial or harmful changes in the general susceptibility to infectious diseases, but the following mechanisms are likely to be involved. Heterologous T-cell immunity It is well known from animal studies that infections, apart from inducing pathogen-specific T-cells, also induce cross-reactive T-cells through epitope sharing, so-called heterologous immunity. Heterologous T-cell immunity can lead to improved clearance of a subsequent cross-reactive challenge, but it may also lead to increased morbidity. This mechanism may explain why DTP could have negative effects. It would, however, not explain effects occurring shortly after vaccination, as for instance the rapidly occurring beneficial effects of BCG vaccine, as the heterologous effect would only be expected to be present after some weeks, as the adaptive immune response need time to develop. Also, it is difficult to explain why the effect would vanish once a child receives a new vaccine. Trained innate immunity The concept that not only plants and insects, but also humans have innate immune memory may provide new clues to why vaccines have non-specific effects. Studies into BCG have recently revealed that BCG induces epigenetic changes in the monocytes in adults, leading to increased pro-inflammatory cytokine production upon challenges with unrelated mitogens and pathogens (trained innate immunity). In SCID mice that have no adaptive immune system, BCG reduced mortality from an otherwise lethal candida infection. The effects of BCG presented when tested after 2 weeks, but would be expected to occur rapidly after vaccination, and hence might be able to explain the very rapid protection against neonatal septicaemia seen after BCG vaccine. Trained innate immunity may also explain the generally increased resistance against broad disease categories, such as fevers and lower respiratory tract infections; such effects would be difficult to explain merely by shared epitopes, unless such epitopes were almost universally common on pathogens. Lastly, it is plausible that the effects are reversible by a different vaccine. Hence, trained innate immunity may provide a biological mechanism for the observed non-specific effects of vaccines. Controversy In 2000 Aaby and colleagues presented data from Guinea-Bissau which suggested that DTP vaccination could, under some circumstances (e.g. absence of pertussis) be associated with increases in overall mortality, at least until children received measles vaccine. In response, WHO sponsored the analysis of a variety of data sets in other populations to test the hypothesis. None of these studies replicated the observation of increased mortality associated with DTP vaccination. WHO subsequently concluded, that the evidence was sufficient to reject the hypothesis for an increased nonspecific mortality following DTP vaccination. However, Aaby and colleagues subsequently pointed out that the studies which failed to show any mortality increase associated with DTP vaccination used methods of analysis that can introduce a bias against finding such an effect. In these studies, data on childhood vaccinations were typically collected in periodic surveys, and the information on vaccinations, which occurred between successive home visits, was updated at the time of the second visit. The person-time at risk in unvaccinated and vaccinated states was then divided up according to the date of vaccination during the time interval between visits. This method opens up a potential bias, insofar as the updating of person time at risk from unvaccinated to vaccinated is only possible for children who survive to the second follow-up. Those who die between visits typically do not have vaccinations between the first visit and death recorded, and thus they will tend to be allocated as deaths in unvaccinated children – thus incorrectly inflating the mortality rate among unvaccinated children. This bias has been described before, but in different contexts, as the distinction between 'landmark' and 'retrospective updating' analysis of cohort data. The retrospective updating method can lead to a considerable bias in vaccine studies, biasing observed mortality rate ratios towards zero (a large effect), whereas the landmark method leads to a non-specific misclassification and biases the mortality rate ratio towards unity(no effect). An additional problem with the literature on the nonspecific effects of vaccines has been the variety and unexpected nature of the hypotheses which have appeared (in particular relating to sex-specific effects), which has meant that it has not always been clear whether some apparent 'effects' were the result of post hoc analyses or whether they were reflections of a priori hypotheses. This was discussed at length at a review of the work of Aaby and his colleagues in Copenhagen in 2005. The review was convened by the Danish National Research Foundation and the Novo Nordisk Foundation who have sponsored much of the work of Aaby and his colleagues. An outcome of the review was the explicit formulation of a series of testable hypotheses, agreed by the Aaby group. It was hoped that independent investigators would design and conduct studies powered to confirm or refute these hypotheses. Also, the two foundations sponsored a workshop on the analysis of vaccine effects, which was held in London in 2008. The workshop resulted in three papers. The proceedings were forwarded to WHO which subsequently concluded that it would \\"keep a watch on the evidence of nonspecific effects of vaccination\\". In 2013, WHO established a working group tasked with reviewing the evidence for the non-specific effects of BCG, measles and DTP vaccines. Two independent reviews were conducted, an immunological review and an epidemiological review. The results were presented at the April 2014 meeting of WHO's Strategic Gourp of Experts on Immunizations (SAGE). WHO/SAGE concluded that further research into the potential NSEs of vaccines was warranted. Implications for world health Dr. Frank Shann from Australia recently assessed the consequences of changing the current EPI schedule to an alternative schedule taking non-specific effects into account, and concluded: \\"If all neonates in high-mortality regions were given BCG at birth, and the revised immunization schedule ... were adopted, with extra doses of measles vaccine at 14 weeks and 19 months (at a cost of only US $0.60/dose delivered), ~1 million (30%) of the 3.2 million neonatal deaths each year might be prevented in developing countries, and 1.5 million (30%) of the 4.8 million deaths between 1 month and 5 years of age might be prevented\\". Furthermore: \\"This very large reduction in mortality in children <5 years of age would be achieved at a low cost using only vaccines that are already in the routine EPI schedule\\". The Arc of the Swallow In 2008, Danish crime novel author Sissel-Jo Gazan (author of the Danish crime novel Dinosaur Feather) became interested in the work of the Bandim Health Project and based her science crime novel The Arc of the Swallow (Svalens Graf) on the research into non-specific effects of vaccines. The novel was published in Danish in 2013; it was on the best-seller list for months and won the Readers' Prize 2014 in Denmark. It was published in English in the UK on November 6, 2014 and in the US on April 7, 2015.

It is situated near Brajići village, on a hilltop overlooking the road between Budva on the coast and Cetinje, the Montenegrin capital at the time. Constructed in the 1840s, it was attacked during an 1869 rebellion and was garrisoned by Austrian troops until the fall of the empire in 1918. After passing to the newly established Yugoslavia, it was garrisoned again by Italian troops for a period in the Second World War. The building is now abandoned and in a ruinous condition. Background Until 1918, the Austro-Hungarian Empire controlled a narrow coastal strip from Kotor (known then as Cattaro) to just south of Petrovac. At Budva, about half-way along this strip, a road leads through the mountains above the town to Cetinje, the old Montenegrin capital. The area was of great strategic significance as it was the point at which the Austro-Hungarian, Montenegrin and (until 1878) Ottoman borders met. In 1841 Prince Petar II Petrović-Njegoš of Montenegro reached an agreement with Austria under which the border between Montenegro and the empire was demarcated, and the Austrians recognised Montenegro's independence. Fort Kosmač was built as the southernmost part of a network of fortifications constructed by the Austrians around the Bay of Kotor and along the coastal strip. However, Austrian control of the area was not secure. Two serious rebellions were mounted by the powerful Krivošije clan who lived on the eastern flanks of Mount Orjen above Risan. In 1869 the clan defeated an Austro-Hungarian force sent to quell their rebellion, while their local allies attacked Fort Kosmač. A second rebellion in 1882 was eventually put down by the Austrians. Description The fort is located on the hill of Kosmač, close to the village of Brajići on the Budva- Cetinje road, at an altitude of about above sea level. It was constructed using finely-dressed limestone obtained from local quarries. The fort was built on a roughly north-south alignment and consists of a symmetrical building with two wings meeting a central semi-circular section at an angle of about 20 degrees. The end of each wing has a semi-circular extension that faces east at a right angle to the main line of the wing. This design gave the fort's defenders views in eight directions, with rectangular windows and large arched gun ports facing out over the hinterland. The central semicircular tower faces west and seaward. The fort is now in a ruinous condition; it once had three storeys, but the topmost storey has collapsed entirely, leaving it roofless. The interior walls, floors and central staircase have also collapsed.See this photograph for the fort's appearance prior to its abandonment. Although the remains of the main staircase are still visible, the steps have disappeared entirely and the upper level cannot be reached, though there is nothing left of the upper floor to stand on in any case. The interior of the fort is strewn with large quantities of fallen masonry, completely obscuring the original floor level. The extent of the collapse is so complete that it is no longer known how the interior was originally laid out. There are substantial holes in the interior's vaulted ceiling. The exterior has been subjected to some stone-robbing in pursuit of the finely-worked square blocks of grey limestone that were used to line the fort's outer walls. A spacious courtyard is situated outside the fort and was once flanked by a garrison building, of which only fragments now remain. A cistern that provided the garrison's water supply is also located in this area. The fort is readily accessible and is the site of a waypoint along the long-distance footpath, the Primorska planinarska transverzala, that leads along the Montenegrin coast. However, its ruined state means that there is a significant risk of falling masonry and visitors are advised to be extremely cautious in entering the building.Sullivan, pp. 86, 88 History The construction of Fort Kosmač probably began shortly after the border was demarcated in 1841; it was completed around 1850.Sullivan, p. 84 It was garrisoned by 6 officers and 248 soldiers of various specialities and was armed with 240 mm cannons. During the Krivošije rebellion in 1869, the fort was attacked by a local clan. Its commander Friedrich Merz was shot and killed by Vukale Perov Stojanović from nearby Brajići, who subsequently became something of a local hero and is commemorated in Brajići's church. Merz's death was attributed by the press to his \\"own imprudence\\", as he had chosen to take a walk outside the fort while it was under siege from the insurgents. It was not captured and in 1875 it hosted a visit from the Emperor Franz Josef I of Austria. The current design of Fort Kosmač dates from 1909, when it was armed with 8 mm machine guns, 90 mm KM-04 artillery guns and 150 mm cannons. It continued to be occupied by the Austro-Hungarians until the end of the First World War in 1918, when the empire collapsed and the coastal strip was united with the post-war Kingdom of Yugoslavia. It saw a further period of usage from 1941–43 during the Italian occupation of the Montenegrin coast in the Second World War. Since then, the fort has been abandoned. It is now owned by the Republic Institute for the Protection of Cultural Monuments of Montenegro. The Ministry of Culture of Montenegro describes Fort Kosmač as being \\"of outstanding national importance.\\" Although the fort is now in an advanced state of ruination, proposals have been advanced to save it. This could be done either by shoring it up and arresting the progressive collapse of the building, preserving it as a ruin and a site of memory, or by restoring it and using it as accommodation (such as a youth hostel or holiday apartments) or as a cultural complex. The cost of preserving and restoring the fort was estimated in 2005 to be up to around €1.7 million. However, as of 2017, the fort continues to be neglected and its disintegration is still ongoing.

It is positioned at the 67,0° West position thanks to an agreement with the Andean Community to use the Simón Bolivar 2 satellite network. It replaces AMC-3 and AMC-4 to provide enhanced coverage and significant capacity expansion. The satellite has a pure Ku-band payload with 55 transponders offering direct-to-home broadcasting and enterprise and broadband connectivity. Its three wide beams cover Mexico and the Caribbean, Brazil, and Spanish-speaking South America. After several delays, SES-10 was launched on 30 March 2017 aboard a Falcon 9 Full Thrust. The launch marked the first time in aerospace history that an orbital-class first stage was successfully reused. The first stage was recovered for a second time, setting another record. A third record comes from a successful splashdown of the payload fairings.  Satellite description  SES-10 is based on the three axis stabilised Eurostar E3000 satellite bus. It has a mass of , produces 13 kW of power and has a design life of 15 years. It uses a hybrid approach for spacecraft propulsion, using bi-propellant propulsion for orbit raising and electric propulsion for station keeping. Its electrical system uses a Hall- effect thruster with a Xenon regulator and feed system supplied by ArianeGroup. ArianeGroup also supplies 14 S10-21 thrusters for the reaction control system, plus 17 pyrovalves and 13 fill and drain valves. Its payload comprises 55 Ku-band transponders arranged in three wide beams. The first beam covers Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, the second beam covers Hispanic South America, and the third beam is dedicated to Brazil.  History  Falcon 9 Flight 32, world's first reflight of an orbital class rocket, launching SES-10. On 20 February 2014, SES S.A. ordered a new satellite, SES-10 from Airbus Defence and Space. It was to be built on the Eurostar E3000 platform, weight , produce 13 kW of power and have a design life of 15 years. It would be positioned in the 67.0° West orbital slot, which belonged to the Simón Bolivar 2 registry belonging to the Andean Community. From there, it would offer an all Ka-band to Latin American and the Caribbean. On the same day, SES disclosed that they had contracted with SpaceX for launch services. While initially thought to be launched aboard a Falcon Heavy due to performance limitations of the Falcon 9, it was clarified that it would, in fact, launch aboard the smaller rocket. At that time, it was believed that the launcher could only perform geosynchronous transfer orbit missions of up to , but SpaceX spokeswoman Emily Shanklin disclosed that the company had reserved for its own use. On 30 August 2016, it was announced that SES-10 would launch aboard a Falcon 9 Full Thrust rocket no earlier than the fourth quarter of 2016. On 30 March 2017, the launch from Pad 39A, Kennedy Space Center, Cape Canaveral, Florida, became the first to reuse an orbital rocket's first stage, booster B1021, previously launched on the 23rd Falcon 9 mission that launched CRS-8. After delivering the payload, the first stage landed on a drone ship, becoming the first orbital rocket stage to return from space for the second time. Additionally, one clamshell half of the payload fairing remained intact after a successful splashdown achieved with thrusters and a steerable parachute. On 15 May 2017, the satellite became fully operational at 67.0° West.

The script for the film was adapted by Jean-Louis Bory, who was an admirer of Freda's work, having met him in 1962 in Paris. Bory claimed that he wrote the adaptation and dialogue exclusive to function with Freda's direction. According to Freda and his assistant director Yves Boisset, Trapped for the Assassin was a project Freda really cared about. Shooting for the film took four weeks and used three cameras at once. Release Trap for the Assassin was released in France on 17 May 1966. It was distributed theatrically in Italy by Regional as Trappola per l'assassino on 21 October 1966. Italian film historian Roberto Curti stated that the film had poor distribution and was hardly noticed by critics or audiences. It has been given an English title Trap for the Assassin despite that the film does not appear to have been released overseas. Reception In France, s reviewer praised Freda's direction in the film \\"We would like that all...knew as much as Freda how to handle a camera (see the trail sequence) and its spectacular potential. That's what makes this cheap little film such a beautiful illusion and a definite pleasure\\" Gilles Jacob praised the film, but noted that \\"let's face it, we would not go see [the film], were it signed by Cayatte or Maurice Cloche.\\" See also * List of French films of 1966 * List of Italian films of 1966  References  Footnotes Sources Goble, Alan.

Other members of the church who believed in the principles of plural marriage soon followed. After Winston Blackmore became the bishop in the 1980s, the group took the name of Bountiful, British Columbia.

In September 2002, Mormon fundamentalists in Bountiful divided into two groups when Winston Blackmore split with the FLDS Church. Blackmore concluded that Warren Jeffs had exceeded his authority and become too dictatorial; as a result, Blackmore was excommunicated from the FLDS Church. About 700 people broke away and followed Blackmore to form what would eventually be named the Church of Jesus Christ (Original Doctrine) Inc.

It includes surviving elements of both a log house and log barn built in the late 19th century by Anders Olsson, a Swedish immigrant. The barn is the only known surviving barn in Maine to have been built during the wave of Swedish immigration in the later decades of the 19th century. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. Description and history The Olsson Farm is a property located on the west side of West Road, a rural north-south road on the west side of New Sweden in northern Aroostook County, Maine. The farmstead consists of a connected series of structures, beginning with a 1-1/2 story wood frame structure that has a front-facing gable roof. A single-story hip-roofed porch extends across the east-facing front and wraps around to the south side, and there are a pair of sash windows in the gable end. A shed-roof addition extends across the north of this main block, with a shed-roof dormer in the main roof above. Behind this main block is attached a 1-1/2 log structure with a gable roof at a lower height but with the ridge in the same east-west orientation. A frame porch is attached to its south side, and there is a gabled dormer in the south-facing roof. The interior of this space has exposed log walls. A modern log breezeway joins this section to the log barn, forming the entire complex into an L shape. The barn has a log section that is , with a total length of due to a later frame extension. The barn has a gambrel roof, a c. 1915 replacement of the original gable roof. In order to counteract the decline in its rural population due to westward migration, in 1861 the state of Maine embarked on an initiative to promote immigration to the rural northern part of the state. This led to an influx of primarily Swedish settlers, the first group arriving in 1870. Anders Olsson arrived in 1871, his wife Johanna the following year. Olsson is believed to have built the log portion of the house at a different location soon after his arrival, and the log portion of the barn in 1873; the existence and dimensions of both buildings are documented in an 1874 article. In 1889, possibly because of his growing family, Olsson built the frame portion of the house, moved the old log house to its position at the new structure's rear. Olsson's buildings demonstrate a high quality of log construction that differs notably from the cruder methods of log construction found in other parts of Maine, with particular attention given to ensuring the weather tightness of the structure. The barn is the only one known to survive from the early period of Swedish immigration to the area.

The service is available on its website, on Android and iOS apps. As of August 2015, the service handles 150,000 broadcasts each day. The majority of the users of YouNow are under 24 years old. Many users perform music or dance, others talk or make jokes. There was some media attention in 2015 on a number of users who film themselves sleeping. A tag-based topic system enables viewers to browse content of their choice, while trending streams enable users to locate more popular webcasters. It competes with apps like Meerkat and Periscope although others have compared it with sites like Chatroulette. YouNow was founded by Adi Sideman in September 2011, but significantly grew in popularity during 2014 and 2015 following significant changes to the service. A round of funding in 2015 raised $15 million from venture capitalists, bringing the total invested to $30 million. YouNow bought live streaming company BlogTV.com in 2013, user accounts being merged into YouNow. MTV partnered with YouNow for the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards. The Huffington Post has started streaming a live show on YouNow weekly since August 2015. The Shorty Awards featured a \\"YouNower of the Year\\" category in 2016 and 2017. America's Got Talent partnered with YouNow to hold auditions for Season 11 with the final auditions on YouNow held live in YouNow HQ on Times Square, on March 1, 2016. In 2017 YouNow began losing user broadcasters, including many partnered users and their fans, to other social media apps including Live.me and Twitch. In 2019, in an attempt to bring user broadcasters and fans back, YouNow developed and implemented similar features that Live.me and Twitch already had on their social media platforms. These similar features included high definition resolution broadcasting, the ability to assign chat moderators and the ability to have multiple guest broadcasters (up to 3) at the same time with the broadcaster. Gold bars replaced likes as the in-app currency on the lower priced YouNow gifts at time of this redesign. YouNow has also introduced a new platform rewards system in the form of Props. Features Partnership YouNow has a partner program that allows popular broadcasters to earn money. Virtual goods bought by viewers are used to acclaim videos; the resulting revenue is split between YouNow and the video creator, with about 60% going to the latter. Partnership is offered to accounts in good standing at YouNow's discretion.

Built in 1871, it is one of the finest examples of the Second Empire architecture in Hancock County. Its design is attributed to George W. Orff, an architect working out of Bangor. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. It now houses a financial services office. Description and history The Whiting House is prominently sited at the northwest corner of the junction of Main and High Streets, on the fringe of Ellsworth's central business district. This intersection is where United States Route 1 turns from Main Street (west of the junction) southward onto High Street, and Route 1A continues north onto Oak Street. The building is separate from the junction by Whiting Park, a small public park created early in this century on land formerly owned by Whiting. The house is a three-story wood frame structure, with two full stories and a third under the mansard roof. It is roughly square in shape, with a slightly-projecting central pavilion in the front (south-facing) facade that is topped by a mansarded observatory. The entrance is sheltered by a flat-roof portico supported by clusters of columns, with low balustrades to the sides. The building's corners are decorated with paneled pilasters, and there is a projecting single-story bay to the east. All of the roof lines have modillioned eaves, and windows have decorative shallow hoods, except the first floor front windows, which have a gabled pediment above. A 1-1/2 story ell projects to the rear of the building. The interior of the main block retains original decorative elements, including lavish woodwork and decorative hardware. The house was commissioned by Samuel Kidder Whiting, a local dry goods merchant, in 1871, when he was just 18 years old, and it was his home until his death in 1917. Its design has been attributed to Bangor architect George W. Orff; he was the only architect working in the area at the time, and the house bears some resemblance other examples of Orff's work in Bangor. It is the largest known work of his outside Bangor. The building now houses a financial services firm.

He did not make one appearance for Kalamata in the league but did manage a cup appearance. Shortly afterwards he was transferred to Kerkyra for a fee believed to be in the region of €100,000. At the time Kerkyra were in the top tier of Greek football, the Superleague Greece. Andreopoulos made one appearance for the club that season in which Kerkyra were relegated to the Football League, Greece's 2nd tier of football. Andreopoulos proved vital in Kerkyra's push for promotion notching up 23 appearances in the league, 2 in the cup where they were knocked out by Panetolikos, and 9 in the promotion playoff in which evidently Kerkyra finished 2nd in meaning they returned to Greece's top flight. In the 2014-15 season Andreopoulos managed 26 appearances scoring one goal. His appearances caught the eye of AEK Athens who having just been promoted back to the Superleague Greece for the 2015-16 season, acquired Andreopoulos for a fee believed to be in the region of €160,000.

It aired on September 25, 2014 on ABC in the United States. The episode was written by Stacy McKee and directed by Kevin McKidd. On its initial airing it was watched by 9.8 million viewers which was an increase from the tenth season finale \\"Fear (of the Unknown)\\". The episode is also the most watched episode of the entire season. In the episode the doctors at Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital, Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) in particular deals with the departure of Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh) in the finale of the previous season and the episode also marks the arrival of Maggie Pierce (Kelly McCreary) the half-sister of Meredith and the daughter of Richard Webber (James Pickens Jr.). Caterina Scorsone who portrays Amelia Shepherd is promoted to a series regular starting with this episode after recurring in the previous season. Plot The episode starts with the ever-present into voice- over, with Meredith reflecting on memories. We quickly learn that they are a tricky business, as she reflects back on a day we’ve seen before, Richard breaking up with Ellis at the carousel. She remembers calling the ambulance when Ellis slit her wrists, and a doctor advising her that she saved her mother's life. What she doesn't realize is that her memories aren’t completely accurate. We hear a baby cry and Ellis say she doesn't want to see \\"her.\\" Meredith remembers it as the same day, but we see her in a different dress outside the hospital curtain. We, as viewers, now know the timeline of Maggie's birth, but clearly Meredith has suppressed the memory. Now that Cristina is no longer at Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital, Maggie Pierce must step up to the plate as the new cardio-thoracic surgeon. Meredith and Maggie clash in the OR in true sister fashion as their personalities are complete opposites. Callie and Arizona debate over the use of a surrogate; Callie initially doesn't want a surrogate, but changes her mind realizing that one can't control everything. Arizona wants to shelf the idea altogether in order to become a fetal surgery fellow, which means going back to school. April's worried about Owen being alone after Cristina's departure and decides he needs a new buddy. Jackson offers up drinks, Richard chimes in for Jenga, and Derek flat out invites him for a man-date. Owen declares himself fine, but we'll see how long that lasts. Alex and Bailey fight for Cristina's position on the board. Richard, Jackson, and Derek try to distract Owen from Cristina's departure by inviting him to hang out on a \\"man date thing.\\" Meredith leans to Alex to console the loss of her best friend, which makes Jo jealous. Derek tells Meredith that he chooses her and the kids over his brain mapping initiative in Washington, D.C. Production The premiere was the first episode to not feature Sandra Oh as a series regular post her departure in season 10 On August 13, 2013, Sandra Oh revealed that she would be leaving after Season 10 of Grey's Anatomy. Thus, this is the first season in which Dr. Cristina Yang, portrayed by Sandra Oh, is not included in the main cast of characters. Creator Shonda Rhimes on Oh's exit said, \\"I know Sandra pretty well. It was one of those things where I so wished it wasn't true for many reasons. For me, as a human being, I love spending time with Sandra, and as a writer, writing for Sandra is one of the best things that's ever happened to me. I would hope that it wouldn't be happening -- but I also know Sandra, and I know that it's time for her to have new challenges. I get to have new challenges all the time because I get to create other shows, but she doesn't get to do that, so I fully understood it.\\" On being asked about what was her takeaway from the journey by The Hollywood Reporter Oh replied, \\" It's Ellen's (Pompeo) line where she says, \\"I am not finished.\\" What was challenging for me was, I was finishing. I spent the past year finishing to get the character to this moment. But for me, it was the specific interpretation I had of Cristina saying, \\"I am not finished.\\" That speech fills me now. That speech is about how she is not finished. Anyway, I wish I said that more eloquently because I cannot tell you how much that line means to me.\\" Reception Broadcast \\"I Must Have Lost it on the Wind\\" was originally broadcast on September 25, 2014, in the United States on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC). The episodes were watched by a total of 9.81 million. In the key 18-49 demographic, the episode scored a 3.1/11 in Nielsen ratings, It was ranked 22 in overall viewership and 18 in 18-49 demographics. Reviews The episode received mostly positive reviews from the critics. Tv Fanatic wrote, \\"The acting remains stellar, the drama is mixed with just the right amount of humor and darn it if I'm not now wrapped up in the future of MerDer.\\" Entertainment Weekly gave a mixed to positive review to the episode saying, \\"Overall, it wasn’t a particularly memorable hour, but it was a good note on which to start a season. It was a way to show the fans that things can go back to normal even in a world without Yang. But considering that the show can’t replace Yang with an outdoor windstorm every week, it’ll be interesting to see where we go from here.\\" On Cristina's exit TV.com wrote, \\"So, the question I had heading into (Grey's Anatomy's) Season 11 premiere was just how much Cristina's absence would be felt. And at the end, I have to say-while the lack of Yang was definitely noticeable, I think the show will be just fine with out her.\\" Cartermatt called Ellen Pompeo the star of the premiere, \\"Ellen Pompeo’s performance was great throughout this, and understated in much of the same way it often is. Her subtlety is probably why she is often overlooked. This was most present in the episode’s final moment, as Derek turned down the Washington DC job, which she clearly things he did just because she wanted him to.\\" References Grey's Anatomy (season 11) episodes 2014 American television episodes ","title":"I Must Have Lost it on the Wind"},{"id":"46560260","text":"Augustus Austen Leigh (1840–1905) was the 32nd provost of King's College, Cambridge.

A 1993 report from Sandia National Laboratories recommended that any such message should comprise four levels of increasing complexity: *Level I: Rudimentary Information: \\"Something man-made is here\\" *Level II: Cautionary Information: \\"Something man-made is here and it is dangerous\\" *Level III: Basic Information: Tells what, why, when, where, who, and how *Level IV: Complex Information: Highly detailed written records, tables, figures, graphs, maps and diagrams Message The Sandia report aimed to communicate a series of messages non-linguistically to any future visitors to a waste site. It gave the following wording as an example of what those messages should evoke: Written messages Proposed design for \\"small subsurface markers\\" to be buried randomly in great numbers across the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant has done extensive research in development of written or pictorial messages to warn future generations. Since today's written languages are unlikely to survive, the research team has considered pictograms and hostile architecture in addition to them. Texts were proposed to be translated to every UN written language. Design for an information center at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant Conceptual designs for the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant included an \\"Information Center\\" at the geometric center of the site. The building would be an open structure of solid granite or concrete, measuring , and contain Level IV messages. The plans included a suggestion that the building be designed so as to create a distinctive whistling sound when wind blew through it, drawing attention to itself. Working as part of the Human Interference Task Force in 1981, Vilmos Voigt from Eötvös-Loránd University (Budapest) proposed the installation of warning signs in the most important global languages in a concentric pattern around any terminal storage location. As time passed, further signs would be added translating the earlier signs, with the earlier ones remaining in place.  Physical markers  The Sandia report explored designs for physical markers which conveyed the concepts of dangerous emanations, shapes that evoke bodily harm, and the concept of \\"shunned land\\" that appears destroyed or poisoned. The designs suggested included: ;Landscape of Thorns: A mass of many irregularly-sized spikes protruding from the ground in all directions. ;Spike Field: A series of extremely large spikes emerging from the ground at different angles. ;Spikes Bursting Through Grid: A large square grid pattern across the site, through which large spikes protrude at various angles. ;Menacing Earthworks: Large mounds of earth shaped like lightning bolts, emanating from the edges of a square site. The shapes would be strikingly visible from the air, or from artificial hills constructed around the site. ;Black Hole: An enormous slab of basalt or black-dyed concrete, rendering the land uninhabitable and unfarmable. ;Rubble Landscape: A large square-shaped pile of dynamited rock, which over time would still appear anomalous and give a sense of something having been destroyed. ;Forbidding Blocks:A network of hundreds of house-sized stone blocks, dyed black and arranged in an irregular square grid, suggesting a network of \\"streets\\" which feel ominous and lead nowhere. The blocks are intended to make a large area entirely unsuitable for farming or other future use.  Cultural memory  Linguist Thomas Sebeok, building on earlier work by Alvin Weinberg and Arsen Darnay and working as part of the Human Interference Task Force, proposed the creation of an atomic priesthood, a panel of experts comparable to the Catholic church, which has preserved and authorized its message for almost 2,000 years. The priesthood would preserve the knowledge of radioactive waste's locations and dangers through rituals and myths.Thomas A. Sebeok, \\"Pandora’s Box in Aftertimes\\" in I think I am a verb : more contributions to the doctrine of signs, Springer, 1986, pp. 149-173. French author Françoise Bastide and Italian semiotician Paolo Fabbri proposed that domestic cats be genetically engineered to change color in the presence of dangerous levels of radiation. The significance of these \\"radiation cats\\" or \\"ray cats\\" would be reinforced through fairy tales and myths, the story being that one should move away from sites where such creatures are encountered, or where domesticated cats begin to exhibit such behaviour.

The work was commissioned by the Seattle Youth Symphony Orchestra and was completed in 1992, shortly before its premiere by the Seattle Youth Symphony, conducted by Ruben Gurevich, at the Seattle Opera House on May 10, 1992.Richard M. Campbell, \\"Youth Symphony Ends Season on a High Note\\", Seattle Post-Intelligencer (May 11, 1992): C3. The title of the work comes from the stratovolcano Glacier Peak in the Cascade Range, visible from Hovhaness's home in Seattle, Washington. Composition The symphony was inspired by the stratovolcano Glacier Peak in the State of Washington. A performance of the piece lasts approximately 19 minutes. The symphony is composed in three movements: #Andante maestoso #Andante espressivo, \\"Love song to Hinako\\" #Largo maestoso, \\"Prelude and Fugue\\" The second movement is dedicated to Hovhaness's wife Hinako Fujihara. Reception Andrew Farach- Colton of Gramophone praised the piece, writing, \\"As the title suggests, it has a preponderance of hymn-like melody, yet there’s a valedictory quality to the music that I find touching. The finale is particularly effective, moving from hymn to one of Hovhaness’s most tuneful fugues via a darkly atmospheric interlude.\\" Mark Swed of the Los Angeles Times also lauded the work, further commenting, \\"Enthralled with mystical Asia, Bach and mountains, Alan Hovhaness is often accused of writing formulaic, long-lined and heady counterpoint that predictably resolves into spiritually grandiose cadences. But if his music is all of a mold, in the best of it the lingering melodies are gorgeous; the fugues, fabulously opulent; the finales, downright mood-elevating.\\" On the other hand, Anthony Burton of BBC Music Magazine was more critical of the symphony, writing of it and other late-period Hovhaness works, remarking: Another music critic similarly opined that Hymn to Glacier Peak \\"fades only by comparison\\" to Hovhaness's other work, adding, \\"if it were the only work he ever wrote, we would revere it as a masterpiece.\\" Reviewing the premiere performance, Paul Schiavo remarked on the symphony's \\"radically conservative style\\". While agreeing that it may please some listeners, \\"it offers no experience with the rhythms, melodic contours and textures of modern music. Young players ought to be familiar with these, but Hovhaness' symphony spared the Youth Symphony any encounter with them.\\" See also *List of compositions by Alan Hovhaness References 66 1992 compositions Compositions for symphony orchestra 20th-century classical music ","title":"Symphony No. 66 (Hovhaness)"},{"id":"46560517","text":"Itchepackesassa Creek is a stream in Hillsborough County and Polk County, Florida, in the United States.

Delux Films, (AIR 1978 SC 1613) is a landmark decision of the Supreme Court of India in the area of copyright law. The case deals with a copyright infringement suit against the movie New Delhi made by Mohan Sehgal in 1954. The plaintiff R.G. Anand, contended that it was modeled on the plot of a play Hum Hindustani written and produced by him. The judgment is remarkable for clarifying the concepts of idea-expression dichotomy and copyright infringement under the Indian copyright law.  Background of the case  The plaintiff wrote the play Ham Hindustani and it soon became very popular. In 1954, the defendant Mohan Sehgal sent a letter to the plaintiff that he wishes to make a movie based on the play. The plaintiff met the defendant and discussed the entire play. The defendant did not commit anything, but the plaintiff later came to know that the defendant released a movie titled New Delhi. After watching the movie, the plaintiff was of the opinion that it is based on the story of his play. So he filed a suit against the defendant for permanent injunction and damages. Both the District Court and the High Court ruled against the plaintiff on a finding of the facts. The case finally reached the Supreme Court of India.  Relevant legal framework  A Play is a dramatic work under Section 2(h) of the Copyright Act, 1957. The movie will be an ‘adaptation’ as per Section 2(a)(i). For a dramatic work, making an adaptation is a statutory right provided under Section 14 (a)(vi) of the Copyright Act, 1957. A movie which copies a play will be an infringement as per Section 51 unless excluded by Section 52.  Facts This section has the storyline of the play and the movie followed by comparison table for identifying similarities and differences in the play. Play A Madrasi and Punjabi family are neighbours. They have cordial relations. Chandra, the daughter in the Punjabi family and Amni, the son in the Madrasi family fall in love with each other. Both sets of parents are against this affair and set out to find same-community matches for their kids. By a divine coincidence both engage Dhanwantri-a marriage broker for this purpose. Chandra’s parents find a boy named Bansi for her. Chandra asks Amni to talk to his parents but he prefers suicide instead. Eventually, both enter into a suicidal pact and run away leaving behind a suicide note. Before they go ahead with their plan, Dhanwantri intervenes and gets them married. In another scene, the parents are distraught to find the note and regret their aversion to inter-community marriage but at the same time the married couple enters. Movie Anand, a graduate comes from Punjab to Delhi and meets Janaki, a Madrasi girl on the railway station. Anand finds it difficult to find accommodation and has to pretend to be a Madrasi. Subramanian, father of Janaki lives close-by and meets Anand. Anand happens to join the music school where Janaki teaches. Janaki is impressed by Anand’s singing and slowly falls for him. She invites him to a celebration at her house. Next day, he plans a date with Janaki but realizes that his father and sister are arriving in town. He goes out on the pretext of showing the city to his sister Nikki and meets an acquaintance Ashok Banerjee, a Bengali painter there. He leaves his sister with Ashok and goes to meet Janaki. Later all 4 of them come face to face and Anand does not introduce Nikki as his sister to Janaki at which Nikki gets offended. He later explains the whole situation to her. Meanwhile, Ashok falls for Nikki. Subramaniam wants Anand to marry Janaki and invites his father to discuss this. Anand takes his south Indian cook as his father to their house. The principal of the music school invites Anand and Janaki for an award ceremony where Anand again has to present the cook as his father and because of this the actual father gets offended. He goes to the stage and beats up the cook. The truth about Anand being a Punjabi and not a Madrasi is out. Both fathers don’t like their kids associating with a person from another community. Subramaniam arranges Janaki’s marriage. Anand asks Janaki to negotiate with her father. Janaki tries but is rebuked by her father. Janaki is frustrated and runs away leaving a suicide note. At the river which is the spot she chooses to die, she meets an old friend of her fathers who promises to help her. He takes her to Anand’s father’s house where she pretends to be a Punjabi girl and the proposal for marriage is accepted. In another story, Nikki’s marriage has been arranged with someone from her own community after her father got to know about her and Ashok’s affair. At the marriage ceremony, the groom demands dowry. Nikki’s father is unable to pay. Ashok arrives on the scene and offers his mother’s jewelry to pay for Nikki’s dowry. Nikki’s father has an awakening and after seeing the difference between the values of Ashok and the Punjabi groom, he agrees to an alliance between Nikki and Ashok. Thus, there is a happy ending for all parties involved.  Important issues discussed by the Court  *Is the film New Delhi an infringement of the plaintiff's copyright in the play Hum Hindustani? *Have defendants or any of them infringed the plaintiff's copyright by producing, or distributing or exhibiting the film New Delhi? Important aspects of the decision  The Court clarified the following important aspects in this casePara 52 of the judgement  #There can be no copyright in an idea, subject-matter, themes, plots or historical or legendary facts and violation of the copyright in such cases is confined to the form, manner and arrangement and expression of the idea by the author of the copyrighted work. #It has to be seen whether similarities are fundamental or substantial aspects of the mode of expression adopted in the copyrighted work. Copying should be substantial or material one. #Test: Whether the viewer after having read or seen both the works is clearly of the opinion and gets an unmistakable impression that the subsequent work appears to be a copy of the original. #Where theme is same but presented differently, there can be no question of infringement. #If there are material and broad dissimilarities along with similarities, it negatives the intention to copy the original work. If the coincidences appearing in the work are clearly incidental then there can’t be infringement. #If the viewer after the incident gets the idea that the film is by and large a copy of the original play, violation of the copyright may be said to be proved. #Burden of proof is on the plaintiff in cases where a stage play has been infringed by a movie director. After applying the principles enunciated above the court ruled that it cannot be said that the film is a \\"[s]ubstantial or material copy of the play written by the plaintiff.\\"(Para 67) The judges were of the opinion that no prudent person after seeing both the works will get the impression that there is a copy. At most, the central theme of provincialism is the same but that is an idea not protected by copyright. Justice Pathak in his concurring opinion said \\"[t]he story portrayed by the film travels beyond the plot delineated in the play.\\" (Para 72) He also observed that \\"[i]n the attempt to show that he is not guilty of infringement of copyright, it is always possible for a person intending to take advantage of the intellectual effort and labours of another to so develop his own product that it covers a wider field than the area included within the scope of the earlier product, and in the common area covered by the two productions to introduce changes in order to disguise the attempt at plagiarism.\\" (Para 72) However he said, in the present case the dissimilarities are so material that it is not possible to say that there is an infringement. For future cases, he opined that \\"[i]n another, and perhaps a clearer case, it may be necessary for this Court to interfere and remove the impression which may have gained ground that the copyright belonging to an author can be readily infringed by making immaterial changes, introducing insubstantial differences and enlarging the scope of the original theme so that a veil of apparent dissimilarity is thrown around the work now produced. The court will look strictly at not only blatant examples of copying but also at reprehensible attempts at colourable limitation.\\" (Para 72) Significance of the decision  This judgement is considered as a landmark decision in the area of Indian copyright law. Most importantly, it clarified that copyright protection does not extend to mere ideas. This case has been cited and followed in many of the subsequent judgments from different courts in India. One of the most recent ones is Mansoob Haider v. Yashraj Films,2014 (59) PTC 292. from the Bombay High Court where the Court had to decide whether the Bollywood movie Dhoom 3 was an infringement of the plaintiff’s copyright in the script ONCE. To some extent the test laid down by the Supreme Court in this case can be compared with the Nichols abstraction test in the US. The residue after filtering out dissimilarities is the idea which is not copyrightable and similarity of ideas does not lead to copyright infringement.

They have smooth scales, anal spines, and forked tails. Mojarras have a single dorsal fin, with spines of decreasing length along the fin. The dorsal and anal fins have scaly sheaths at their bases. A unique feature of the family Gerreidae to which it belongs is the mouth, as the upper jaw extends downward when the mouth is opened and forms a tube. When the mouth is closed, the lower jaw is concave, providing another distinctive feature. The spotfin mojarra has a black spot on the anterior part of the dorsal fin. This species also has a groove on the top of its snout that lack scales, and generally has a more slender body than other species of mojarras. On the upper part of the body, faint, irregular bars are visible.  Distribution and habitat  Mojarras are tropical species, but a small number of juvenile fish have been found in the Lower Hudson at Bowline Pond and Indian Point.

The anal fin has three spines with 12 to 13 short rays. A scaly sheet covers the dorsal and anal fin spines, while the soft rays lack scales. On the body of the pigfish, above the lateral line there are 53 to 58 pored, lateral scales in ten longitudinal rows, and 15 to 19 rows below. The body color is generally light blue-grey, which fades to silver along the ventral region. Scales are bluish with bronze spots on the edge, which form stripes that are horizontal below the lateral line and curve slightly upward above the line. Fins are mostly yellow-bronze with dusky edges. Adults average 9.1 inches (23 cm), but have been recorded at lengths of up to 14.9 inches.  Distribution and habitat  Pigfish are found along the Atlantic coast of the United States from New York to the northern Bahamas and Bermuda and in the Gulf of Mexico from Florida to the Yucatán Peninsula. Juveniles commonly occur in shallow waters near shore, often near vegetation. Adults are more frequently found in deeper areas over soft bottoms. Pigfish inhabit waters that range in temperature from 56.7 to 96.8 °F (13.7 to 36.0 °C) but are most commonly found at temperatures of 75.0 to 80.0 °F (23.9 to 26.7 °C).

These are mainly marine, tropical and temperate fishes characterized by a powerful sucking disk on the underside of the forebody.  Description  The skilletfish has a frying pan-shaped body which can grow to about 3 inches in length. The body is compressed dorsoventrally with the head being wider than the body. Tiny eyes are located on top of the head. The fish also has strong teeth and fleshy lips. Color varies from a pale gray to dark brown with a mottled pattern. About 6 faint lines radiate from eye. The fish also has a dark band at the base of its rounded tail fin. Modified pelvic fins form a large suction disc on the underside of the body. The dorsal and ventral fins are set fairly far back on the body.  Diet  Skilletfish primarily feed on bristle worms and small crustaceans such as amphipods and isopods.  Habitat  Usually lives among oyster reefs, but may also be found within eelgrass beds. Stays in shallow waters near the shore during warmer months but will move to deeper waters in winter. Almost always clings to rocks or shells with suction disc.  Reproduction and life cycle  For the skilletfish, spawning occurs between April to August. The female will lay a few hundred sticky, amber-colored eggs into an empty oyster shell, which the male will then protect until they hatch. Upon hatching, the fish is 2.4-3.4 mm long, and it generally grows about 9 mm during development, eventually reaching 40–45 mm long when it is time for the first reproduction  Distribution  The skilletfish can be found in the Western Atlantic: Bermuda, New Jersey and northern Gulf of Mexico in USA to southeastern Brazil. It is absent from the Bahamas. It can also be found in the Eastern Central Pacific: coastal lagoons and tidal flats of Sonora, Sinaloa and Nayarit, Mexico. The skillet ranges from New Jersey and New York in the northern end of its distribution south to Brazil, also occurring in the West Indies and the Gulf of Mexico.

Elected to the Oklahoma House of Representatives in 1975, Hastings served district 67 until 1984. After serving in the legislature, Hastings served for 16 years as Tulsa County Clerk, retiring in 2001. Since retiring from public office, Hastings has worked in real estate in the Tulsa area. She is an inductee of the Tulsa Central Hall of Fame. Early life Joan King Hastings was born in Drumright, Oklahoma in 1932. Hastings had two older sisters and enjoyed her childhood growing up on a farm. Her mother was the county's health nurse, and since her father was deceased, they lived at her grandmother's house. When Hastings was eight years old, a family member, Leon C. Phillips, ran for governor of Oklahoma. This was Hastings' earliest exposure to politics. She graduated from Tulsa Central High School. Hastings cast her first vote when she was 21 years old for Dwight D. Eisenhower. Around this time, Hastings had become active in the Young Republicans at the University of Tulsa. Hastings was elected Miss Republican, which allowed her the opportunity to ride on top of an elephant down Pennsylvania Avenue. Hastings majored in special education at Tulsa University. Career After graduating with her degree, Hastings taught special education, as well as physical education, for a number of years. In addition, Hastings owned her own private swimming school, Aqua Tots, for 32 years. Hastings received the John F. Kennedy award for her work with handicapped children. Oklahoma House of Representatives (1975-1984) Hastings decided to run for office due to the encouragement from her Young Republican friends. Hastings' bridge club, Sunday school class, and the Young Republicans made up her large group of volunteers. During her campaign, Hastings would often ride her horses around the district instead of driving in her car. In the primary, Hastings won every district by a large margin. In the general election, Hastings won by the highest plurality in the United States. The first bill Hastings presented concerned computerizing Supreme Court records, which passed. Hastings passed the Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs Bill, which worked to form that agency within the Oklahoma government. Hastings became the first female to serve on the Wildlife Committee; she also served as vice-chair of the Mental Health Committee. She was the first female to serve as caucus chairman, for either party, and she chaired the Republican House Caucus for two years. Additionally, Hastings chaired the Housing and Urban Development Committee for the National Council of Legislators. She was also vice president as well as president-elect of the National Republican Legislators Association. In 1977, Hastings was named Outstanding Republican Legislator in the nation.

Other terms for the practice include \\"nickel ride\\" (a reference to carnival rides), \\"cowboy ride\\", \\"joyride\\", \\"bringing them up front\\" (referring to sudden braking), and \\"screen test\\" (as the prisoner may hit the protective screen behind the driver). Rough rides have been implicated in a number of injuries sustained in police custody, and commentators have speculated that the practice contributed to the death of Freddie Gray in Baltimore, Maryland, in April 2015. Throughout the U.S., police have been accused of using aggressive driving tactics to \\"rough suspects up\\", resulting in numerous injuries, and millions of dollars of damages awarded to victims and their families. Baltimore lawyer Phil Federico described the practice as \\"definitely intentional\\", saying \\"they're unbelted, the inside of these wagons are not padded, they can't protect themselves, and they get thrown from one side to the other, usually landing on their head, and fracturing their neck.\\" The practice has been described as torture by activist Marc Lamont Hill. University of South Carolina professor Geoffrey Alpert, an expert in police use of force, has asserted that the practice was common in the 1980s and 1990s, but has become less so with the increased presence of video recording equipment in police vehicles. There are no reliable records of the frequency of these incidents. Alleged incidents Baltimore A Baltimore Police Department van, similar to the one which carried Freddie Gray, burnt during the subsequent 2015 Baltimore protests Timeline of Freddie Gray's arrest, based on Baltimore state’s attorney Marilyn J. Mosby, and police statements In 1980, 58-year-old John Wheatfall broke his neck and became paralyzed during a ride to Baltimore's Southwestern District. Wheatfall was seated on a bench with his hands cuffed behind his back, when he was thrown to the floor and hit his head against the wall. Baltimore police vans did not have seatbelts at the time. The officer driving stated he had swerved to avoid an oncoming car, and an investigation did not find evidence of negligence. Wheatfall sued for $3 million, and was awarded $20,000 for his injury. In 2004, Jeffrey Alston was awarded $39 million after becoming paralyzed from the neck down as a result of a ride in a Baltimore police van. In 2005, Dondi Johnson Sr., a plumber, was arrested in Baltimore for public urination. Apparently uninjured at the time of his arrest, Johnson emerged from the police van paralyzed with a broken neck, and died two weeks later from pneumonia resulting from his injuries. Johnson stated he had been thrown face-first into the interior of the van during a sharp turn. His family sued the Baltimore police and were awarded $7.4 million, which was reduced to $219,000 under a cap imposed by Maryland state law. In 2012, Christine Abbott, a 27-year-old assistant librarian at Johns Hopkins University, was arrested at a party she was hosting at her home in Baltimore's Hampden neighborhood. She was handcuffed and put into a police van. Abbott later sued the officers in federal court, describing her ride as \\"like a roller coaster\\", and accusing the officers of braking short and taking \\"wide, fast turns\\" which slammed her into the walls. Police acknowledged that Abbott was not buckled in during her ride. Some media commentators have suggested that the \\"rough ride\\" practice was a factor in the 2015 death of Freddie Gray, although state prosecutors have not alleged that Gray was subjected to a rough ride. Gray was arrested on April 12, and was conscious and able to speak before being placed into a police van. Following a thirty-minute ride, Gray was comatose and not breathing. He was treated at the R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center of the University of Maryland Hospital, where his spinal cord was found to be 80% severed, an injury consistent with a serious car accident. Gray died a week after his arrest. Medical experts say Gray may have sustained a neck injury during his arrest which could have been exacerbated during his transport. Police acknowledged that Gray was not buckled in, contrary to departmental policy. On September 9, 2015, the City of Baltimore approved a $6.4 million civil settlement with Gray's family. The first criminal case to be tried of the police officers involved with Gray's arrest resulted in a mistrial. Philadelphia A 2001 investigation by The Philadelphia Inquirer documented twenty people injured in rough rides in Philadelphia. Three suffered spinal injuries, and two were paralyzed. As of 2001, courts had awarded $2.3 million in legal settlements resulting from these cases, but no officer had ever been disciplined for the practice. The Philadelphia Police Department began to introduce vans with padding and safety restraints in December 2000. On April 10, 1994, Gino Thompson was thrown from his seat when the police van carrying him stopped suddenly. Thompson sustained a spinal cord injury which paralyzed him from the waist down. Thompson was awarded $600,000. On March 31, 1995, John DeVivo was arrested, handcuffed, and placed in a police van. DeVivo reported that the driver slammed on the brakes, throwing him to the floor and fracturing his tailbone. The police claimed that a dog had run into the road, and denied wrongdoing. DeVivo sued and was awarded $11,000. On September 29, 1996, Bernadette Moore, age 34, sustained injuries to her shoulder and back after a police ride in which she reported that the driver was \\"swerving and slamming on the brakes\\". She was later awarded $15,000. In 1997, Calvin Saunders was thrown from his seat and slammed his head against the wall of a police van. He became paralyzed from the neck down, and was awarded $1.2 million. On April 15, 1998, Robert Schwartz Sr., age 44, broke a vertebra in his neck during what he described as a wild police wagon ride. He was awarded $110,000. On February 21, 1999, Carlice Harris, age 44, sustained injuries to her face, knees, and wrists during police transport. She was awarded $22,500. In 2001, James McKenna was arrested outside a Philadelphia bar. McKenna alleged that he heard an officer tell the driver of the van to \\"fuck him up.\\" During a 20-minute ride including quick stops and sharp turns, he repeatedly slammed his head into the walls, ultimately breaking three vertebrae in his neck. McKenna was awarded $490,000. Other incidents In 1980, Chicago plumber Freddie Franklin alleged in a federal lawsuit that he was wrongfully arrested by six members of the Chicago Police Department and forced into the back of a police van in handcuffs. The van was allegedly driven recklessly, throwing Franklin around the van and causing him to bite off his lower lip. Franklin received $135,000 from the city in a settlement of the lawsuit. Following a traffic stop on October 19, 1997, a Los Angeles Police Department disciplinary panel concluded that officer Ray Logan had carried out a \\"screen test\\", among other abuses. Logan was subsequently fired. In 1999, a former police chaplain in Aurora, Illinois sued that city's police department, alleging that it was a common practice for police in Aurora to drive recklessly so as to attempt to injure handcuffed suspects. The department denied the allegations and the lawsuit was eventually settled. In November 2017, Andreu Van den Eynde, a lawyer for several ministers of the Republican Left of Catalonia sentenced to prison in Spain, questioned how his clients \\"were contained mechanically\\" during transport from the Audiencia Nacional to a prison in Estremera, away. Spain's Ministry of the Interior did not confirm whether the prisoners were cuffed in the vans or not. Van den Eynde did not immediately file a complaint of mistreatment, pending medical reports.

It is capable of burning both natural gas and petroleum, but mostly burns natural gas. The plant currently consists of eight separate generating units; Mystic 8 and 9 are combined cycle natural gas units with a total of four combustion turbines and two steam turbines which can produce 1414 MW total, Mystic 7 is a natural gas or petroleum unit which produces 576 MW, and Mystic Jet is small petroleum fueled unit which produces 8.6 MW in periods of high demand. History A circa-1960s aerial view showing Mystic 4–6 in operation Mystic Generating Station was originally owned and operated by Boston Edison after its construction in the early 20th century. It originally operated three natural gas units (Mystic 1-3) which have since been decommissioned. In the 1950s, the station was expanded to include three additional units (Mystic 4-6) which had a combined output of 468 MW until their retirement in 2003. Mystic 7 was constructed in 1975 and remains the oldest operating unit at the station. Mystic 8 and 9 were constructed in 1999 and make up the majority of the station's electrical production. In the mid 1990s, the state of Massachusetts began to deregulate the electrical market. This led to the sale of the Mystic Generating Station to Sithe Energies who started a large capital investment in the construction of Mystic 8 and 9 which was completed in 2003. Sithe was acquired by Exelon in late 2003 who ran into financial difficulties which resulted in BNP Paribas taking control of the station. BNP Paribas sold the station soon after its acquisition to Boston Generating. Boston Generating ended up declaring chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2010 and was sold to Constellation Energy. Constellation Energy and Exelon merged in March 2012, returning ownership to Exelon. Exelon continues to operate the station. Recently, the Toxics Action Center has targeted the Mystic Generating Station as one of the five largest polluting power stations in the state. Other groups have also become concerned that the plant relies too heavily on Distrigas Liquefied Natural Gas from Yemen which has been experiencing political unrest. Changes in the wholesale energy markets left Mystic uneconomical to operate under most conditions, leading Exelon to apply to close Mystic from 2022. ISO New England ordered units 8 and 9 to remain operational until the transmission system could be upgraded under a FERC Order 1000 competitive solicitation. Once an upgrade project was selected ISO-NE announced that Mystic Station would be allowed to fully retire on June 1, 2024.

This article will illustrate how the traditional skirt is made and at which occasions it is worn. It further describes the various designs and patterns of an isidwaba and how they are perceived in society, including the symbolic anthropology associations of the isidwaba. Description of the Isidwaba  The isidwaba, which is also known as isikhakha, is a traditional Zulu leather skirt worn by a betrothed and married woman. It is made of cowhide or goatskin, as depicted on the South African Heritage Resource Agency website. The isidwaba has remained virtually unchanged since the 19th century whereas other traditional objects have undergone transformations both in form and material used to make them. The isidwaba is usually given as a gift by the father of the bride from the cow given to the bride-to-be for her Umemulo (Coming of Age) ceremony. She in turn will wear the leather skirt on the day of her wedding. The father of the bride will dress her with the isidwaba in the ancestor's hut. Sometimes the father will direct his eldest son in dressing the bride, this being a way of passing on the tradition. Women attach the importance in defining their marital status to isidwaba although it is also put forward that they place their greatest importance in the exchange of cattle in marriage transactions. Still, isidwaba remains an important and integral part of the married woman’s life to the extent that the women can only be freed from wearing isidwaba when they become menopausal. Importantly, when a woman gets married it is a transition from her father's homestead to that of her husband's. This is where isidwaba plays a critical role that affords her ancestral protection from her new found ancestors (who at this point have not accepted her as a member of the homestead). It is only after her first child has been born that she is accepted as a member of the family. Isidwaba is usually made from a cowhide obtained from the woman's father's cattle. During ukwendisa – where the father of the bride supplies a beast that accompanies his daughter to her new homestead – the hide of the beast is sewn into her skirt for her to wear. Goat skin is also used, in other subcultures of the Zulu nation, to make isidwaba. These subcultures are usually located in the regions of the nation where goats thrive on the vegetation of the area, and are therefore more numerous than cattle. It is therefore not surprising that such areas would supply goat skin for the making of isidwaba.  Processing of an Isidwaba  In the process of using cowhide to make an isidwaba,after the cow is slaughtered, the cowhide is stretched and dried in the sun for approximately three days. Thereafter, the hide is dipped into water for a period of seven days to decompose. The hair is scraped and removed from the decomposed hide, after which the hide is dried in the sun using Umbhobe (Milkwood tree). The hide is scrubbed with a brush, creating a suede like texture. It is removed from the sun a day before it is issued to a team that will squash, straighten, soften and dye it. The hide's black colour is achieved by applying a mixture of oil and wood ashes / charcoal. Added to this, fat is rubbed onto isidwaba as the skirt must never be washed. Fat protects it against water. To wash the skirt is equalled to washing away the woman's ancestors and thus her protection from her husband's homestead. Like the isidwaba, the fat is said to guard her against the potential wrath of her husband's ancestors.  Design of the Isidwaba  The isidwaba represents respect for the family of the husband; therefore it must be of knee-length thereby reducing exposure above the knees. The isidwaba is worn by folding it over the waist and lower limbs up to the knees. The side ends must overlap to ensure that the bride is adequately covered by the isidwaba and that she must not be exposed, even whilst doing the traditional dance. The grass made belt, called isifociya, is tied around the waist to keep the isidwaba in position. Another belt called an impempe is left on the side to hang as decoration. The predominant dyed colour of the isidwaba is black. The Nazareth Baptist Church (NBC) version of the isidwaba reaches just below the knees and the pleats are broader than the usual isidwaba, as per the picture below: NBC Isidwaba full length NBC members have a second version of the isidwaba that is natural uncoloured cowhide for daily usage. It is a shorter version that is used by married women as an under garment. The uncoloured isidwaba is worn over a lace garment that is tube-like called itete, which also extends to cover isidwaba on top. The itete is used for protection and hygienic purposes.  Measurements  The isidwaba measures 61 cm in height, prior to the top end being folded to accommodate the belt. The weight is approximately 1.8 kg. It has pleats that are 1 cm to 1.5 cm wide. The NBC's isidwaba has wider pleats measuring 4.5 cm. It measures 100 cm in height and its weight is approximately 2.5 kg. (Please note: the sample was one item of each version and cannot be a generalisable sample)  Decoration  The traditional Zulu leather skirt is decorated with beaded panels in some areas. The Zulu nation is well known for its intricate beadwork, with each colour having a symbolic meaning. The decoration of the beads, designed and patterned in a particular manner, not only expresses certain literal and figurative or poetic meanings, but also shows a fashionable style as a medium of social interaction, status and social display. The isidwaba's progression through fashion can be seen on the various patterns and colour sequences on the belt which holds the isidwaba in place. In a modern-day twist, fashion designer Sindiso Khumalo vibrantly incorporates isidwaba in her Autumn / Winter 2013 collection, titled Umabo  Symbolism  The isidwaba is said to be imbued with ancestral power, as a result their leather skirts do not belong to them but to the ancestors. Izidwaba (plural) are protective ancestral garments perceived as concrete symbols of control over women's fertility. A woman is considered figuratively naked, unless she wears her isidwaba. As a result, the women have no choice but to wear their skirts that are also described as 'ancestral blankets' that enfold and protect the wearer. If the women refrain from wearing the skirts it is believed that they will incur illness or, worse, death. This is a transgression that can only be obviated by slaughtering an animal from their agnatic homesteads to appease their husbands' ancestors. It is not the skill employed in the execution of art objects that is valued, but the spiritual powers they invoke through it. As with the isidwaba, it is by pouring or rubbing the substances onto the artefact that these powers are invoked. The object itself is otherwise meaningless. Another symbolic value is that Amadlozi (ancestral spirits) prefer the dark, this being the reason why the isidwaba is blackened. As a result of this dark marriage skirt, the Amadlozi can accompany the bride to her husband's homestead and ensure her fertility. It is further highlighted in literature that migrant men feel secure when their women wear these skirts when they leave for urban areas. It provides a sense of security that their wives are less likely to have an affair with other men in fear of their ancestors. The author further indicates that married women wear the leather skirts at holy events such as marriage and at a sacred dance The isidwaba brings respect to the woman wearing it and becomes a symbol to show that she is \\"taken\\". To demonstrate the sacredness centred on this Zulu traditional leather skirt, it is said it can never be thrown away, it is buried.

She pioneered immigrant social service work and had a major influence on the institute movement. She founded and led the International Institute movement, which was focused on improving the lives of female immigrants. The International Institute was a movement for cultural pluralism with efforts towards protection of immigrant girls in 1910. She was a resident at the University Chicago settlement as well as a researcher for the Chicago Women's Trade Union League. She then became a special agent for the United States Immigration Commission and also worked as a field investigator for the Chicago Juvenile Court. These field works inspired her to focus on the problems of female immigrants. She believed that other immigrant social welfare agencies, both public and private, poorly served women. Bremer strongly opposed Americanization programs and wrote that Americanization stimulated fear and hate. She then served as a special agent for the United States Immigration Commission. Bremer was concerned that the existing public and private agencies serving immigrants largely ignored women so she made her most important contribution by establishing the first International Institute in New York City as a YWCA experiment in December, 1910. As a national field secretary for the National Board of the YWCA in New York, she began to work with immigrant girls. This institute was focused on assisting newly arrived and second-generation immigrant girls and women. It provided recreational and club activities, English classes, and assistance with employment, housing, naturalization and other problems. Trained social workers who were mostly immigrants themselves were the ones who did the teaching, visiting, counseling and casework. She inspired institute workers to begin working with immigrant communities as a whole by engaging in traditional settlement house tasks and handling immigrant problems as case workers. Their ideas helped preserve the immigrant heritage. Bremer and other International Institute workers became activates of cultural pluralism by accepting immigrants on their own terms. They attempted to ease their transition to American Society. By the early 1920s, over 55 international institutes had been established mainly in industrial cities with heavier immigrant populations such as Boston, Buffalo, and Detroit. In the 1920s and early 1930s Edith helped organize new Institutes and made field visits to advise on programs as well as sponsor annual meetings of Institute workers. She later testified as an expert witness at congressional hearings on immigration policies.  Early life  Bremer grew up in Chicago and did field research on women in industry at the Chicago School of Civics and Philanthropy. She was the elder daughter of Benjamin Stites and Mary Baldwin Terry. Benjamin Stites graduated from Colgate University in 1878 and served as a Baptist minister. While Bremer was born he was a history teacher at Colgate then he became a professor of English history at the University of Chicago.  Marriage and children  Edith Terry married Harry M. Bremer on September 4, 1912. Harry Bremer was a resident at the Greenwich House settlement in New York City and then became a special agent with the National Child Labor Committee later on.  Death and afterward  Died of cancer on September 12, 1964. After her death, former United States commissioner of immigration Edward Corsi paid a tribute to Bremer's concern for people of all nationalities and the effort she devoted to the welfare of immigrant and refugee.

He made his first-class cricket debut in 2015 and is a right-arm fast-medium bowler and a right-handed batsman. Robinson is the step-son of Paul Farbrace who has worked as a coach with international teams.  Career  Robinson began his career playing for Kent Second XI.

In October 2013, Robinson signed a professional contract with Yorkshire. After making seven T20 Blast appearances for Yorkshire during the 2014 season Robinson was sacked by Yorkshire in July for \\"unprofessional actions\\". Yorkshire coach Jason Gillespie said of the situation that \\"When a player consistently displays behaviour that isn’t professional, there has to be a point in time when you say 'look, this isn’t really working, you’re obviously not that bothered about playing for the club'. That point came, and it was tough.\\" and that \\"He’s got to learn about his game and about being a professional sportsman. I think there will be a future for him in the professional game, but I think he needs to learn a lot, and I think he can do it.\\" Later in the 2014 season Robinson made one List A appearance for Hampshire. In April 2015, Sussex signed Robinson on a short- term deal, after an injury crisis with bowlers Tymal Mills, James Anyon and Lewis Hatchett all unavailable. Robinson had played a Second XI match for Sussex and was named in the squad for a County Championship match the next day against Durham where he made his first-class debut. In the match Robinson, batting at number nine, scored a century in a Sussex record-breaking tenth- wicket partnership with Matt Hobden of 164. In doing so, he became the first Sussex player in 95 years to score a century on their County Championship debut. Robinson took his first five-wicket haul in May 2015 against Warwickshire. In the 2015 season, Robinson took 46 Championship wickets at an average of 24.71, and was nominated for the LV= Breakthrough Player Award and won the Sussex Young Player of the Year award.

For his part in the coronation, Erroll was heavily fined; Oliver Cromwell's government demanded £2000 sterling in 1654 under Cromwell's Act of Grace. Erroll petitioned this ruling, stating that he had not fought in any battles against England, and such a fine would bankrupt him. After the restoration, he received a regrant of his titles in 1666.

Marshal Wrubel was survived by his daughters, Emily and Julia, and his wife Natalie Wrubel, née Frank, (1925–2010), who was his high school sweetheart and married him in 1946. The asteroid 1765 Wrubel is named in his honor.

The name was coined in 2009 to describe the dual role of this gene, encoding both an antisense RNA that regulates the p53 tumor suppressor and a protein involved in DNA repair, telomere elongation and maintenance of nuclear organelles Cajal bodies (Figure 1).Farnebo, M. Wrap53, a novel regulator of p53. Cell Cycle 8, 2343-2346 (2009).Venteicher, A. S. et al. A human telomerase holoenzyme protein required for Cajal body localization and telomere synthesis.

Mol Cell 34, 47-57, doi:10.1016/j.molcel.2009.02.020 (2009).Figure1.The WRAP53 and p53 genes and their gene products. The arrows indicate the direction of transcription and the dotted lines the exon overlap between these genes. Localisation The WRAP53 gene is localized on chromosome 17p13.1 and contains 13 exons, including three alternative starting exons (1α, 1β and 1γ) generating at least three gene products. The WRAP53 gene partially overlaps the p53 tumor suppressor gene in a head-to-head orientation. Function of WRAP53α and WRAP53γ Transcripts of WRAP53 that overlap the first exon of p53 (referred to as WRAP53α transcripts) regulate the levels of p53 mRNA and protein (Figure 1).Saldana-Meyer, R. et al. CTCF regulates the human p53 gene through direct interaction with its natural antisense transcript, Wrap53. Genes Dev 28, 723-734, doi:10.1101/gad.236869.113 (2014). WRAP53γ transcripts overlap the first intron of p53 and are antisense to the previously identified transcript Hp53int1 localized within this intron. However, the function of WRAP53γ remains elusive. Function of WRAP53β protein The WRAP53 gene also encodes a protein termed WRAP53β (alias WRAP53 or WDR79 or TCAB1), which belongs to the WD40 protein family (Figure 1). WRAP53β facilitates protein- protein and protein-RNA interactions and directs factors to nuclear organelles Cajal bodies, to telomeres and to DNA double-strand breaks.Mahmoudi, S. et al. WRAP53 is essential for Cajal body formation and for targeting the survival of motor neuron complex to Cajal bodies.

Genes Dev 28, 2726-2738, doi:10.1101/gad.246546.114 (2014). Factors localized to Cajal bodies with the help of WRAP53β includes the SMN protein, small Cajal body-specific (sac)RNAs and the enzyme telomerase. WRAP53β also targets the ubiquitin ligase RNF8 to DNA double-strand breaks(Figure 2).Figure 2. Functions of WRAP53β In addition to localizing factors to correct cellular sites, WRAP53β maintain structural integrity of Cajal bodies and without WRAP53β these organelles collapse and cannot re-form (Figure 2). Domains of WRAP53β The WRAP53β protein is highly evolutionary conserved, with homologs (confined to its WD40 repeats) in vertebrates, invertebrates, plants and yeast.Tycowski, K. T., Shu, M. D., Kukoyi, A. & Steitz, J. A.A conserved WD40 protein binds the Cajal body localization signal of scaRNP particles. Mol Cell 34, 47-57, doi:10.1016/j.molcel.2009.02.020 (2009).Zhong, F. et al. Disruption of telomerase trafficking by TCAB1 mutation causes dyskeratosis congenita. Genes Dev 25, 11-16, doi:10.1101/gad.2006411 (2011). WRAP53β consists of a proline- rich N-terminus, a central WD40 domain and a glycine-rich C-terminus (Figure 3). Figure 3. The structure of WRAP53β. The numbers indicate amino acid residues. The WD40 domain of WRAP53β serves as a scaffold for multiple interactions between a wide variety of molecules. WRAP53β and Dyskeratosis Congenita Germline mutations in WRAP53β result in disorder known as dyskeratosis congenita, characterized by bone marrow failure, premature ageing, predisposition for cancer and a triad of mucocutaneous features including oral leukoplakia, abnormal skin pigmentation and nail dystrophy. Mutations in WRAP53β are inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion, reside in highly conserved regions of its WD40 domain and result in a more severe form of this disease.Dokal, I.

These mutations reduce the nuclear level of WRAP53β, impair its trafficking of telomerase to telomeres, and subsequently lead to progressive shortening of telomeres in these patients The chaperonin CCT/TRiC is crucial for proper folding of WRAP53β and this folding is impaired in dyskeratosis congenitaFreund, A. et al.

WRAP53β and cancer WRAP53β is overexpressed in a variety of cancer cell lines of different origins and such overexpression promotes carcinogenic transformation indicating that this protein possesses oncogenic properties.Mahmoudi, S., Henriksson, S., Farnebo, L., Roberg, K. & Farnebo, M.

Moreover, knockdown of WRAP53β in cancer cells reduced the size of the tumors formed when these are grafted into mice and triggers mitochondrial- dependent apoptosis in cancer cells. In contrary, inactivating mutations in both alleles of WRAP53β causes dyskeratosis congenita, indicating that this protein acts as tumor suppressor, rather than an oncogene. Loss of nuclear WRAP53β is also correlated with shortened survival and resistance to radiotherapy in patients with head and neck cancer.Garvin, S. et al. Nuclear expression of WRAP53beta is associated with a positive response to radiotherapy and improved overall survival in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Oral oncology 51, 24-30, doi:10.1016/j.oraloncology.2014.10.003 (2015). With its complex roles in a number of cellular processes, WRAP53β may act as a tumor suppressor under certain conditions and as an oncogene in under others. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the WRAP53 gene have been linked to an increased risk for breast and ovarian cancer.Garcia-Closas, M. et al.

It aired on May 15, 2014 on ABC in the United States. The episode was written by Shonda Rhimes and William Harper and directed by Tony Phelan. On its initial airing, it was watched by 8.92 million viewers.Grey's Anatomy (season 10)#cite note-ep10x24-52 The episode marked the departure of one of the lead characters, Cristina Yang, played by Sandra Oh since the inception of the series. The episode focuses on Yang as she prepares to say her goodbyes to the doctors at Grey-Sloan Memorial hospital including her \\"person\\" Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo), her long-time friend and Meredith's husband Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey) and her love-interest Owen Hunt (Kevin McKidd) and leave for Zurich for her new job at the Klausman Institute for Medical Research. The episode received highly positive reviews with Oh's performance receiving enormous praise. Amidst Yang's departure a catastrophe occurs at a nearby mall bringing loads of patients to Grey-Sloan. Derek asks Meredith to move to D.C. with her for his new job. Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez) and Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw) consider having a surrogate mother carry their child while April Kepner (Sarah Drew) is nervous about raising her own child with Jackson Avery (Jesse Williams). Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) is nominated for a position at the Hospital Board to replace Cristina, who instead left the seat for Alex Karev (Justin Chambers). Also, Leah Murphy (Tessa Ferrer) is fired from her job, Shane Ross (Gaius Charles) quits his residency at Grey-Sloan to accompany Yang to Zurich as her student and Richard Webber (James Pickens Jr.) meets with Maggie Pierce (Kelly McCreary), and finds out that her birth mother was Ellis Grey (Kate Burton). This episode marks the final appearance of Sandra Oh as Cristina Yang and Gaius Charles as Shane Ross. It is also the final appearance of Tessa Ferrer as Leah Murphy as a series-regular. Plot The day has arrived that Cristina leaves for Zurich, but a possible act of terrorism delays her departure. Cristina needed to run to the mall, Derek was passing around D.C. brochures, and Alex was looking to buy a fancy car with all his new money. The foundation was cutting funding and Bailey’s genome lab was going to be shut down. Before Yang could get to the mall to buy a European phone charger, an explosion at the mall sends multiple injured victims to the Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital. Leah comes to the ER when she hears about the explosion, but leaves with no goodbyes when she sees every patient had been treated. April told Hunt that she was pregnant, a happy announcement that was interrupted by some not-so- happy news. April receives a pep talk from Catherine Avery, her mother-in-law, when she starts to fear raising a baby in a world that is so dangerous. With all hands on deck, the hospital turned into a zoo filled with decontamination zones, and thankfully, one Cristina Yang. She hadn’t had time to get to the mall, so instead, she came in to lend a hand, as did Leah. Cristina, looking for closure, can’t leave the hospital until she and Meredith dance it out one last time. Shane demands that he take control of his education and leaves to work under Cristina in Zurich. In surgery, Cristina asked Alex if he really wanted to go the private practice route. She told him he had good hands, he thinks fast, and he acts faster. With only two hours until her flight, Cristina was scrubbing in to do Link’s heart transplant surgery, but Meredith told her it was time to go. Cristina found Bailey and Webber they both had to say goodbye to Yang, but not before Shane got a word in. He asked Yang to take him with her to Switzerland. He was in charge of his education and he chose Yang. She was who he wanted to learn from, and she agreed. Cristina told Meredith to wait for her, and she ran to the OR where Owen was operating. Cristina knocked on the gallery glass, and when he looked up, she waved. Outside, Link’s heart arrived in a cab that Meredith shoved Cristina into. She told her to go now or she never would. What did she need, an I love you? Just like that, Meredith told her she loved her and to call her when she got there. Back on the walkway of amazing moments and even more amazing scenery, Amelia was telling Meredith that she could go to D.C. if she wanted because Amy was good here. However, that thought had to be put on hold when Cristina came sweeping through, grabbed Mer and pulled her into an on-call room. She couldn’t go, not before they danced it out. As Meredith found a song, Cristina told her to call at least twice a month and to text all the time, told her to take care of Owen and keep him from getting all dark and twisty, to take care of Alex, which meant mocking him at least once a day to keep him from becoming insufferable. Oh, and “Don’t get on little tiny planes that can crash, or stick your hand in a body cavity that has a bomb in it, or offer your life to a gunman. Don’t do that. Don’t be a hero. You’re my person. I need you alive. You make me brave.” and they dance it out. Meredith tells Derek that she can’t leave Seattle, the place where she grew up and made her life; she’s not going to Washington, D.C., despite what Derek says. Callie and Arizona consider having a surrogate mother carry their future baby after treating a surrogate who was burned by the explosion. Bailey is nominated for a position on the board by Webber due to Cristina’s departure; however, Cristina left Karev her shares of the hospital and her board position. Webber connects with Dr. Pierce, the new head of cardio, and finds out that her birth mother was Ellis Grey. Production Creator Shonda Rhimes said that Oh changed the course of Grey’s Anatomy with her brilliant, nuanced portrayal of Cristina Yang, Sandra Oh declared that she would be leaving after Season 10 and stated, \\"It’s been a great privilege to play the character of Cristina Yang on GA and I am both sad and excited to see where this, her final season will take her,\\" Oh said in her statement. \\"It was an emotional and deeply creative decision for me and I feel fully supported by Shonda Rhimes and the writers. It’s so rare in an actor’s life to be able to explore and grow a character so fully, so completely. I am profoundly grateful to everyone at GA for the opportunity.\\" Creator Shonda Rhimes added. \\"Over the past 10 seasons, I have been made better by Sandra’s trust, faith and friendship and I can’t quantify how grateful I am for her collaboration on a character we both love so deeply. This year is going to be bittersweet for us – we’re both going to savor every moment of Cristina Yang and then we’re going to give her the exit she deserves. And when Sandra walks out of my door, Grey’s Anatomy will be once again be forever changed.\\" Oh told The Hollywood Reporter, which first announced the news. \\"It’s such an interesting thing to play a character for so long and to actually get the sense that she wants to be let go as well. [Cristina] wants to be let go, and I am ready to let her go.\\" and added, \\"Creatively, I really feel like I gave it my all, and I feel ready to let her go,\\" Co-Star Kevin McKidd on Oh's exit said, \\"Pain is sometimes close to pleasure, and there's a lot of pain here,\\" to The Hollywood Reporter, \\"But there will be pleasure again to explore that.\\" Ellen Pompeo who plays Oh's on-screen best-friend and the show's protagonist Meredith Grey tweeted, \\"So proud of the work we've done together @iamsandraoh,\\" along with a picture of her and Oh in their Grey's scrubs to pay tribute to the character \\"We've laughed, we cried, we've kicked some serious acting ass together #SOGRATEFUL.\\" On April 24, Oh filmed her final scene on Grey's Anatomy, and took to social media to reflect on her last day of filming. \\"Starting the last day of shooting on Grey's with my usual mug of tea,\\" she captioned a photo of a Grey's mug. \\"A little meditation and much gratitude.\\" Reception Broadcast The episode was originally broadcast on May 15, 2014 in the United States on the American Broadcasting Company(ABC), and it was watched by 8.92 million viewers. In the key 18-49 demographic, the episode was ranked 10th and 20th in overall viewership rank and was the 4th most watched drama. The episode scored a 2.6/8 in Nielsen ratings.Grey's Anatomy (season 10)#cite note-GA1024-75 Reviews Many critics saw Sandra Oh's performance during the finale as worthy of a Primetime Emmy Award nomination. The episode received highly positive reviews with critics enormously praising Sandra Oh's performance and the send-off for her character. The A.V. Club called the finale \\"emotional\\" and wrote, \\"The finale was an odd combination half-giant explosion, half-sentimental goodbye to a legendary television character. Some of these parts worked out better than other parts, but compared to previous seasons, this finale was much more emotional.\\" stating that, \\"the show’s emotional relationships can resonate strongly enough to bypass soapiness.\\" Wetpaint wrote, \\"Distance from her \\"persona\\" aside, it does seem like Cristina got her happily-ever-after now that she's in her dream job in Zurich, beholden only to her work\\" TV Fanatic lauded the episode stating, \\"There were so many instances where I couldn't help but to shed a tear or two\\", and added \\"Overall, 'Fear (Of the Unknown)' was a moving, stressful and emotional rollercoaster that illustrated Cristina's happy ending in such a seamless way. It was really the best way to say goodbye to Yang, and I'm sad she's gone but am now excited and curious to see how the show will go on without her.\\" Entertainment Weekly also praised the send-off for Cristina writing, \\"I loved how they sent her off. It was to- the-point, she and Meredith danced it out, and it wasn’t made into too big a deal because it’s not as if she died. Then again, if this is the last we’re going to see of her, I felt it should’ve been more central to the episode, right?\\" The site added, \\"Can we talk about how perfect that speech was? I loved the many throwbacks, particularly the one to Cristina’s “don’t be a hero” speech to Burke during season 2’s bomb episodes. This was the Twisted Sisters' goodbye I wanted.\\" and also praised the exit for Tessa Ferrer's character saying, \\"Leah too got a nice exit, walking out of the hospital to find what she’s good at\\" Many sources, including Rachel Simon of Bustle and Nicole Pomarico of Wetpaint, claimed that Sandra Oh's performance during her tenth and final season on Grey's Anatomy is worthy of an Emmy nomination. Simon stated \\"She made us care about Grey’s in a way we hadn’t in years, bringing us into Cristina’s life and mind fully and ferociously. The show has been good for several seasons now; because of Oh’s performance this year, it once again became great.\\"Grey's Anatomy (season 10)#cite note-32Grey's Anatomy (season 10)#cite note-31 References Grey's Anatomy (season 10) episodes 2013 American television episodes ","title":"Fear (Of the Unknown) (Grey's Anatomy)"},{"id":"46561301","text":"The Countess is a play written by the American playwright and novelist Gregory Murphy. It recounts the break-up of the marriage of John Ruskin and Effie Gray, one of the greatest scandals of the Victorian era in Britain. Written in 1995, Murphy's two-act drama premiered in New York in 1999, and transferred twice to ever-larger Off-Broadway venues. It later had a successful run in London's West End, and has since been performed worldwide. Characters *John Ruskin *Effie Ruskin *Elizabeth, Lady Eastlake *John Everett Millais *Mrs Ruskin *Mr. Ruskin *Crawley Plot Based on one of the most notorious affairs of the Victorian Age, The Countess is a play about the idealization and oppression of women. In 1853, the preeminent author and art critic John Ruskin, his wife, Effie Gray, and his friend and protégé, the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood painter John Everett Millais, depart in high spirits for the Scottish Highlands. When they return to London four months later, Millais' hatred for Ruskin is only exceeded by his passion for the beautiful, young Mrs. Ruskin. What Millais did not know was the truth at the core of the Ruskin marriage, a secret, which when revealed through the persistence of Effie Ruskin's friend Lady Elizabeth Eastlake, renowned writer of the period, would rock London society and change forever the lives of Millais and the Ruskins. Productions The play, directed by Ludovica Villar-Hauser, was first performed in 1999 at the Greenwich Street Theatre, New York City. It soon transferred to the Samuel Beckett Theatre, and finally to the much larger Lamb's Theatre. The production ran for 634 performances and was the longest- running play on or off Broadway in the 1999-2000 season.Lortel Archives: The Countess The original production of the play starred Jennifer Woodward as Effie Ruskin, James Riordan as John Ruskin, Jy Murphy (no relation to the playwright) as John Everett Millais, Kristin Griffith as Lady Eastlake, Honora Fergusson as Mrs. Ruskin, Frederick Neumann as Mr. Ruskin and John Quilty as Crawley. In 2005, Villar-Hauser directed the West End production of The Countess, which began at Guildford's Yvonne Arnaud Theatre, before transferring to the Criterion Theatre. Alison Pargeter starred as Effie Ruskin, Nick Moran as John Ruskin, Damian O'Hare as John Everett Millais, Linda Thorson as Lady Eastlake, Jean Boht as Mrs. Ruskin, Gerald Harper as Mr. Ruskin and Edmund Kente as Crawley. The Countess was published by Dramatists Play Service in 2000.http://www.dramatists.com/cgi-bin/db/single.asp?key=2879 Gregory Murphy wrote a screenplay The Countess based on his play. Poster for the 2003 production of The Countess in Tokyo Reception The Countess received critical acclaim when it premiered in the spring of 1999 with the New York Times calling the play \\"…serious…wonderfully witty…erotically charged.\\" \\"splendidly directed\\" and \\"the entire cast is excellent\\".Gates, Anita, \\"A Critic Who Takes His Work Home\\", New York Times, March 30, 1999 The New York Post wrote that The Countess has \\"sex scandal appeal\\", is \\"nicely acted\\" and a \\"Damned good tale\\".\\"The Countess has sex scandal appeal The New York Post Some critics of the London production were less impressed. Michael Billington called it \\"curiously stolid\\" and objected to what he called the \\"forelock- tugging framing device, set in Windsor Castle\\" in which Effie meets Queen Victoria.Billington, M, \\"The Countess: Criterion\\", The Guardian, 8 June 2005 Ian Shuttleworth also objected to the \\"clunky\\" framing scenes, writing that the play \\"is a standard triangular story with several cumbersome attempts to spice it up.\\"Shuttleworth, Ian, \\"The Countess, Criterion Theatre, London W1\\", Financial Times, 2005. Tim Walker of The Sunday Telegraph, however, called The Countess “a wonderful, evocative piece of theatre,” and Emma Whitelaw of indieLondon wrote that it was a “marvelous production,” calling Nick Moran’s portrayal of John Ruskin “sublime.” The Countess sparked some debate over its depiction of John Ruskin, and the resulting controversy led the New York Times to publish \\"A Twisted Victorian Love Tale That Won't Die Out\\" written by Lucinda Franks.Lucinda Franks, \\"A Twisted Victorian Love Tale That Won't Die Out\\", New York Times. Billington said that \\"Murphy takes the stock line that Ruskin was a domestic bully who pontificated about art and beauty while recoiling from living flesh\\", but the play gave no indication of Ruskin's radical political ideas. Margo Jefferson, theatre critic for The New York Times in her essay REVISIONS; Lurking Behind the Victorian Propriety, Wit and Pluck. wrote: The Countess, by Gregory Murphy, reminds us of the terrifying imbalance of power between those who claim adult authority and those they treat like children … It is a revisionist drama, since Ruskin’s wife, Effie, was seen for years as one of those people who surround a genius and have no real needs, privileges or rights that he is bound to respect … The scene in which Effie confesses [the non-consummation of her marriage] to her friend Lady Eastlake is harrowing. She thinks she has a disease that cannot be named and she can barely get the words out … Mr. Murphy centers on Effie, and gives a full-bodied portrait of a woman who was generally seen as too worldly and shallow for such a great man. Here she is restless, quick and at odds with herself, and very much our contemporary. But The Countess does something harder, Mr. Murphy gives us a Ruskin whom we can pity as well as rage against for betraying the ideals he claimed to be teaching us.” Plagiarism dispute In 2010, The Countess generated its own scandal, when Gregory Murphy became embroiled in a protracted and very public lawsuit with actress Emma Thompson, who had written a screenplay Effie Gray based on the same historical events. Murphy said Thompson's screenplay was an infringement on his play and screenplay The Countess, which he claimed he had submitted to Thompson through a mutual friend in 2003 to consider the role of Lady Elizabeth Eastlake in a proposed film of his play, and to Thompson's husband Greg Wise to consider the role of John Ruskin in the play's 2005 West End production.Woman Around TownThe Telegraph In 2008, Emma Thompson announced that she and Wise “had written a script together about John Ruskin, the Victorian art critic, which we want to make into a film.\\" After meeting with Emma Thompson and her producers Potboiler Productions, Murphy was offered a screenwriting fee and co-screenwriting credit with Thompson in settlement of his claim. This settlement offer was later abandoned by Emma Thompson, Greg Wise and their partner Donald Rosenfeld, when their company Sovereign Films took over production of the film and instigated the suit, creating the independent entity Effie Film, LLC, spearheaded by Rosenfeld, to litigate it. In March 2013, District Court Judge Thomas P. Griesa, after allowing Thompson to submit a second revised screenplay into evidence, from which Murphy claimed \\"some of the most troubling material\\" had been removed, ruled that while there were similarities, the screenplays were \\"quite dissimilar in their two approaches to fictionalizing the same historical events\\". In response to Murphy's attorney's concerns that the completed film Effie Gray would not adhere to Thompson's second revised screenplay, Judge Griesa concluded his ruling by saying that Thompson's film would not infringe Murphy's play or screenplay \\"only to the extent that it does not substantially deviate from the November 29, 2011 screenplay,\\" the date of Thompson's second revised screenplay. In May 2013, Effie Gray’s Cannes Film Festival premiere was cancelled. In October 2013, the film was withdrawn from the Mill Valley Film Festival in California due to \\"unforeseen circumstances\\" according to producer Rosenfeld.The Telegraph In December 2013, Thompson said of the still unreleased Effie Gray that its \\"time has probably passed,\\" comparing it to another project of hers that \\"didn't happen either.\\" Effie Gray was released in October 2014, to a modest reception. Thompson plays Lady Elizabeth Eastlake and Greg Wise plays John Ruskin in the film, which they both declined to promote. Camilla Long reviewing Effie Gray in The Sunday Times wrote “nothing fits together” and “no one seems to know why they made this film. Where is Thompson’s passion and commitment, or any hint of what she intended to achieve.” Manohla Dargis in her review in The New York Times called Effie Gray “The cinematic equivalent of a Brazilian wax, the movie omits much of the story’s most interesting material to create something that’s been smoothly denatured.” References 1999 plays Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood in popular culture John Ruskin ","title":"The Countess (play)"},{"id":"46561302","text":"Justin Curtis Smith (born June 5, 1979) is a former American football linebacker who played in the National Football League (NFL) with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and St. Louis Rams.

The widow of painter Jerome Tiger, she served as the caretaker of her husband's artistic legacy since his death in 1967. She wrote one of the first biographies on the life of Jerome Tiger and his artwork. Tiger was also the mother of Cherokee artist and women's rights activist, Dana Tiger. Early life Born in 1943, Peggy Tiger was raised in the towns of Muskogee and Eufaula, Oklahoma. In an oral history interview in 2012, she noted that she had had no interest in art until meeting Jerome Tiger, whom she married when she was eighteen. They had three children together, Dana, Lisa, and Christopher, who was two weeks old when Jerome was killed at the age of twenty-six in a gun accident.Watts, James D., Jr. (July 24, 1992). “The Eye of the Tiger”. Tulsa World. Retrieved 27 April 2015. In the years following, Peggy Tiger would adopt three more children and act as an informal mother to many others, including the friends of her children. She also continued coursework at Bacone College and Northeastern State University, graduating from the latter with a bachelor's degree in American Studies. Career After her husband's death, Tiger and her cousin, Molly Babcock, began collaborating with Bob Lengacher at Tulsa Litho to create limited- edition prints of Jerome's work. She and Molly formed the Jerome Tiger Art Company in 1969, and Molly traveled to promote the prints while Peggy ran the home office, answering the phone, taking orders, and informing potential buyers about the artist and his art. The two women also worked together on the 1980 book, The Life and Art of Jerome Tiger: War to Peace, Death to Life (University of Oklahoma Press, 1980), which was both a detailed biography as well as an art book. The Tiger Art Gallery was formed later, and Peggy ran that for many years. Originating as a T-shirt business to sell the designs of Johnny Tiger, Jerome's brother, it later became even more of a family affair. Today it includes Johnny's work as well as that of two of Peggy and Jerome's children, Dana and Chris (who was killed in a 1990 shooting),(July 27, 1992) “Tragedy Stalks Family Indian Artist’s Daughter HIV-Positive.” Oklahoman.

It is approximately long and flows through Olyphant and Throop. The watershed of the creek has an area of . The creek experiences serious flow loss and is considered to be impaired. It has a natural channel in some reaches, but its channel disappears in other reaches. Rock formations in the creek's vicinity include the Catskill Formation and the Llewellyn Formation. The creek is a second-order stream. A bridge carrying Pennsylvania Route 347 across Eddy Creek was built in the 20th century. More recently, a restoration of of the creek has been planned. The creek is designated as a Warmwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. A greenway/connecting trail in the vicinity of the creek was proposed in the early 2000s in the Lackawanna River Watershed Conservation Plan. Course Eddy Creek begins near Pennsylvania Route 247 in Olyphant, not far from the border of Jessup. It flows west for several tenths of a mile before turning southwest and then north. After a short distance, the creek for several tenths of a mile before turning southwest. A few tenths of a mile further downstream, it turns west-northwest and enters Throop. The creek crosses US Route 6 and turns west-southwest and then west. After some distance, it turns north for several tenths of a mile before turning northwest for some distance. The creek then turns west for a short distance before tuning north and then north- northeast, reentering Olyphant and receiving an unnamed tributary from the right. It then turns northwest and crosses Pennsylvania Route 347 before reaching its confluence with the Lackwanna River after a few tenths of a mile. Eddy Creek joins the Lackawanna River upriver of its mouth. Tributaries Eddy Creek has no named tributaries. However, a 1916 book stated that several small streams discharged into the creek in its upper reaches. At the time, these streams had clear water, but were dry in the summer. Hydrology Eddy Creek experiences total flow loss. Some reaches of the creek have been entirely destroyed by historical mining or by post-mining development. The creek loses all of its flow at above sea level via infiltration into mines. However, a near-constant flow is restored further downstream by stormwater from the Keystone Sanitary Landfill. It also has extensive deposits of culm and silt left over from mining. The creek is considered to be impaired by flow alterations. The likely source of the impairment is abandoned mine drainage. Eddy Creek used to have flow, but has turned into a \\"leaky slow trickle\\" that carries acid mine drainage. In 2014, Joseph D'Onofrio, a senior engineering technician for GTS Technologies, compared the creek to an \\"old perforated pipe\\". Eddy Creek is an ephemeral stream. The electrical conductivity of Eddy Creek was once measured to be 203.50 micro-siemens per centimeter. The concentration of total dissolved solids was measured to be 140 milligrams per liter and the concentration of dissolved oxygen was 66.50 percent. The pH of the creek was 6.99, and the concentration of salinity was 100 parts per million. In the early 1900s, Eddy Creek lacked culm deposits at its mouth. However, its water was colored yellow by sulfur at that location. Further upstream, two pipes discharged mine water into the creek. One of these pipes had reddish water. However, upstream of an ash dump on the creek, the water was clear. Geography, geology, and climate The elevation near the mouth of Eddy Creek is above sea level. The elevation of the creek's source is between above sea level. At one point, Eddy Creek flows through a restored channel at a reclaimed mining site. Further downstream, the creek flows through its natural channel and cuts across a number of rock ledges. However, by the time it crosses US Route 6, it has lost its flow. Nevertheless, its channel is still discernible and its gradient is shallower. The creek loses its channel completely at the intersection of an electric transmission corridor and the Eddy Creek Mine Tunnel. It eventually reappears, but disappears again in strip pits and sinks. From Birds Eye Mine to Underwood Road, the stream channel has been completely destroyed. The creek has an engineered channel in one reach where it passes through a residential area. The streambed of Eddy Creek is dry in some reaches. Its banks are steep and contain riprap and concrete headwalls. A total of 20 percent of the land in the creek's vicinity is on impervious surfaces. The creek flows through one pipe. Its size is . The headwaters of Eddy Creek are in springs and wetlands in the vicinity of Marshwood, near the edge of Moosic Mountain. Sandstones and coals of the Llewellyn Formation are located in the watershed of Eddy Creek. Some drift is located near the creek and reddish shale and sandstone of the Catskill Formation can be seen in this area. In early October 2013, the temperature in the vicinity of Eddy Creek was found to be . The water temperature of the creek was found to be in a 2013 study. Watershed The watershed of Eddy Creek has an area of . The creek is entirely within the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Olyphant. A waterfall or morphologic site known as the Marshwood Slides is in the watershed of Eddy Creek. Wetlands in the watershed include the Dunmore Swamps and Marshwood. The Marshwood Reservoir is located in the upper reaches of both the Eddy Creek watershed and the Little Roaring Brook watershed. Eddy Creek flows through forested land in a reach downstream of US Route 6. Other land uses include industrial land and open space. Neighborhoods in the vicinity of Eddy Creek include the Keystone Industrial Park, the Keystone Sanitary Landfill, and LaCapra Stone & Supply. It is estimated that there is one stormwater detention facility in the watershed. According to a 1992 report, development in an area near the creek would have little adverse impact on the creek. In a visual assessment of six tributaries of the Lackawanna River in 2013, Eddy Creek received the lowest visual assessment score, 100 on a scale from 0 to 200. This was within the \\"marginal\\" range of 56 to 105. The creek received the lowest score in seven categories: instream cover, epifaunal substrate, embeddedness, velocity/depth regimes, sediment deposits, riffle frequency, and channel flow status. Eddy Creek is a second-order, mid-sized stream. History Eddy Creek was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2, 1979. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1198695. Historically, two breakers known as the Eddy Creek Shaft and the No. 2 Shaft were situated on the banks of Eddy Creek. In the late 1800s, a mine fire started in the No. 2 Shaft. As a last resort, water from Eddy Creek and the Lackawanna River were used in an attempt to extinguish it. Historically, there was a dam on the creek. The dam was owned by the Delaware and Hudson Company and was used for impounding water to flush ashes from a power plant. The creek also supplied water for a washery at the Underwood Colliery. A concrete culvert bridge carrying Pennsylvania Route 347 was built over Eddy Creek in 2008. It is long and is situated in Olyphant. A number of historic sites are located in the watershed of Eddy Creek. These include the South Valley Arch, which is in Olyphant, and the DL&W; Pancost Arch, the DL&W; Winton Arch, and the Erie Arch, which are all in Throop. The Hudson Coal mine railroad, a narrow gauge railroad that operated until 1959, shared a culvert under South Valley Avenue with the creek. The borough of Throop once requested a permit to discharge stormwater into the creek. As of the early 2000s, the Bureau of Abandoned Mine Reclamation has been restoring the stream corridor and channel of Eddy Creek. In the early 2000s, it was expected that of the creek would be reclaimed by 2006. As of 2014, there were plans to restore of the creek, starting in Spring 2015 and ending in December 2015. The project would span of territory and feature regrading 30 properties. Three wetlands and two bat habitats will be affected, but no historic or archaeological sites will be, and the flow of the Lackawanna River will not be impacted. Biology The drainage basin of Eddy Creek is a Warmwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. Some areas of the riparian buffer of Eddy Creek contain woody herbaceous plants. Strip mine overburden piles covered in forests also occur in the creek's riparian area. Eddy Creek was described as a \\"low-quality aquatic resource\\" in a 1992 report. Recreation In the early 2000s, the Lackawanna River Watershed Conservation Plan recommended the creation of a greenway/connecting trail along Eddy Creek. Such a trail could link the campus of the Mid Valley School District to the Lackawanna River Heritage Trail at the mouth of the creek.

Revolutionary activities A lawyer in Saintes in 1784, Jacques Garnier stood out from the beginning of the French Revolution by creating and chairing a committee to acquire wheat stocks and sell them at auction. He was Mayor of Saintes in 1790, general attorney of Charente, and he was elected deputy to the French National Convention by the department of Charente-Inférieure. As a member of the Jacobin Club, he aligned himself with the most radical of the Montagnards, whom he considered the faction of public salvation. Jacques Garnier was verbally violent, demanding that the Convention ban in perpetuity emigres of both genders, punishable by their executions if they return to France; this act, with modification, was known as the Law of Suspects. He maintained that Louis XVI should not be treated as accused, but as an enemy, and should be \\"sacrificed to security and justice.\\" His public speeches, often incoherent, were always lengthy; he was forbidden the podium for twenty-four hours during the Trial of Louis XVI. After voting for the king's death, he joined the Committee of Public Safety, 25 March 1793.Henry Morse Stephens,A History of the French Revolution, Scribner, 1905, p. 543. His exasperated colleagues dealt with his interminable interruptions and vitriol by sending him on a mission to the army of the coast at La Rochelle in late April 1793, where he enthusiastically pursued those he perceived as enemies of the revolution. He was therefore not involved in the elimination of Girondins.

While briefly in Paris, 7 August 1793, he proposed a declaration naming William Pitt as an \\"enemy of mankind\\". Responsible for organizing the revolutionary government in the Loir-et-Cher and the Sarthe in March and April 1794, he constantly encountered his colleagues, as well as during his time in Bordeaux. Having learned the fall of Maximilien Robespierre (27 July 1794 ), he was quick to denounce his colleague Marc Antoine Jullien as a \\"tool of Robespierre\\" but did not deny his own radical views. Inconsistently, though, he violently attacked the insurgents of the uprising of 12 Germinal Year III and the Insurrection of the 1st Prairial. He was representative of Mayenne in the Council of Five Hundred, and he endorsed the coup d'état of 18 Fructidor (4 September 1797). In 1806, Napoleon named him Chevalier of the Legion of Honor. Exiled as a regicide in the Bourbon Restoration, in 1815 he moved with his son Simon to the United States, where he joined the Vine and Olive Colony of Bonapartists. In January 1817, when the colony moved to Marengo County, Alabama, on a plot established by an act of Congress in 1816, Garnier and his son remained in Kentucky. In 1818, Jacques Garnier and his son accidentally drowned in Ohio River when their steamboat sank.Rafe Blaufarb, Bonapartists in the Borderlands: French Exiles and Refugees on the Gulf Coast, 1815-1835, University of Alabama Press, 2005, pp. 117, 183.

She is best known for her Cherokee double-walled basket weaving. She was the first of the Cherokee basket makers to decorate the tops of her baskets and incorporate vases within her baskets. Blackbird's customary artist mark is seen in a chain pattern on the top of her baskets. Early life Lena Blackbird was raised by her parents in Cherokee County, Oklahoma, where she attended school until grade eight. Blackbird was the sixth of eight children in the family. Her first language was Cherokee, making school in English a difficult task. After leaving school, she worked on the farm where the family lived. Her earliest exposure to the arts was in helping her mother sew quilt tops at church for missions work. In 1986, Blackbird began work as a demonstrator at the Tsa-La- Gi Village at the Cherokee Heritage Center. It was there that she first learned the art of basket weaving. Blackbird learned using commercial reed from the other women that demonstrated the art for tourists. Almost immediately after she learned how to weave baskets, Blackbird began selling her artwork. Style Blackbird's baskets are notable because she began adorning the top with acorns which caught on with other artists. Blackbird typically worked with commercial reed and honeysuckle rather than using the traditional natural reed. Awards In 1996, Blackbird took the grand prize at the Art under the Oaks competition in Muskogee, Oklahoma, for her first basket entered in a show. The same year, she received the Cherokee Master Craftsman Award in basketry. The award, which launched in 1988, honors Cherokee who have perfected a traditional Cherokee cultural craft. In 1998, she was named a Cherokee National Living Treasure for her basket weaving skill. In 2001, Blackbird earned special merit for her honeysuckle basket at the Cherokee National Museum’s Trail of Tears Art Show and first place in the basketry division of the Cherokee Homecoming Art Show. Later the same year, she received the Cherokee Medal of Honor. The award was established in 1999 to recognize significant contributions to society by those of Cherokee descent. Blackbird was honored again in 2004 at the ninth annual Cherokee Homecoming Art Show for her piece, Let Freedom Ring, which took first place in the contemporary division of basketry. Entry at this show is limited to artists who have membership in the Cherokee Nation, United Keetoowah Band or Eastern Band of Cherokees.

Howard won her first art award at the 1995 Red Earth Native American Cultural Festival in Oklahoma City. Her work is popular with collectors and critics. Early life Howard grew up in a small, rural Oklahoma community. Her family was poor and her parents struggled to raise their eight children. Howard's maternal grandmother had come to Oklahoma from Mississippi in the early 20th century as part of the second removal along the Choctaw Trail of Tears. Her grandmother spoke Choctaw, not English, and would sometimes tell the children stories in Choctaw. Howard's father's family had come to Indian Territory earlier, during the first removal, and at first settled in the Atoka area. Later her grandfather decided to move his family to Stigler, Oklahoma, where there were better schools; they owned land and grew cotton. Howard recalls drawing on anything she could: with a stick in the dirt, on brown paper bags, even on pages of an encyclopedia. She first attended a small country school with both white and Indian children. When other children played with toys or dolls that she did not have, Howard would draw what she saw \\"and that made me feel like I had those things.\\" After third grade, when that school closed, she and her siblings attended Stigler schools, where she was the only Native child in her class. Howard vividly remembers one teacher that scolded her for drawing \\"Indian things\\" on the chalkboard, and for a while she stopped drawing altogether. Her parents were proud of her art. Her father, a house painter, carried some of her drawings in his wallet. Using cheap paint palettes available at the local general store, Howard taught herself to paint. Once her father even took off a day of work to show her paintings at a local event. In 1974 people at a gift shop in Tahlequah \\"laughed at my work, like they didn't want it.\\" After Howard started her family and began working at a sewing factory, she didn't have much time to paint. Then the factory closed down, and Howard worried about finding another job. In a dream she heard her late father say to her, \\"Paint. That's what you always wanted to do.\\" Early career Howard's husband David insisted they visit an art supply store in another town to buy her better paints and paper to use. David also pushed Howard to enter her work in the annual Red Earth art market in Oklahoma City. She had just missed the deadline in 1995 to enter her work as a new artist but was allowed her to submit her request late. As Howard sat among the other artists and their works, she noticed her art was very different from most others. It seemed everything was Southwestern or Plains art. She listened as third place was announced, then second place, and she thought she had lost. When the announcer called \\"Norma Howard\\" for first place, she sat stunned, head down. That morning she had sold every painting in her booth. At Red Earth 1996, Howard won again. After encouragement from Paul Rainbird, of the Southwestern Association for Indian Arts, Howard exhibited at the 1997 Santa Fe Indian Market and every year since. In 1998 she received a prestigious Santa Fe Market fellowship. She used it to travel to Mississippi to visit ancestral places of the Choctaws. Those swamps and lands have continued to inspire her paintings of Choctaw history, when Choctaws hid from troops who sent Native people west to Indian Territory. Style and notable works As a self-taught artist, Howard has developed a unique style of watercolor painting that uses tiny brushstrokes, cross-hatching and layers to produce depth. Her landscapes almost always include people, because she believes it is people who give art life. She remembers as a child using a View-Master to look at pictures \\"so real you could touch it.\\" Growing up, she did not know any Indian artists; in fact did not know many other Native families until her teens. So she was not aware of other Native art. Her first goal as an artist was to make something good enough for her mother and father to hang in their living room. Her painting Green Corn is in the Gilcrease Museum in Tulsa, Oklahoma, while three more paintings hang in the Landmark Bank in Durant, Oklahoma.

From 1955 to 2009, she developed and expanded the market for Oklahoma Native art through her gallery, travels, and raising the visibility of Oklahoma Indian painters both inside and outside of the state. Littrell exerted a major impact upon the careers of Mirac Creepingbear, Doc Tate Nevaquaya, Merlin Little Thunder, and Virginia Stroud, among others. Early life and career Doris Littrell was born in 1929 on a farm near Apache, Oklahoma. Her parents were Clarence and Isa Mason. Her maternal grandmother, Rosa Cook (née Read) homesteaded a ranch on the former Kiowa-Comanche-Apache Indian reservation with William Cook. Littrell grew up around Southern Plains Indians culture. She attended powwows with her maternal uncle and admired the paintings he collected from his neighbor George Geoinety. At age 13, she left home and went to Apache to work for her aunt as a switchboard operator. She worked the night shift at the telephone company and attended school during the day. Her best friend was Comanche and she spent many weekends at her home, absorbing aspects of Comanche culture from her mother, one of the first Comanche nurses. In 1947, Littrell was hired by Southwestern Bell in Oklahoma City and met her future husband, Bob McCabe. As a newlywed, she bought Southern Plains paintings from her maternal uncle who, in turn, had purchased them from his Indian neighbors. When financial stresses soon made it necessary for her supplement her income, she turned to the sale of artwork to make more money. She bought paintings primarily from Kiowa and Comanche artists in Apache, Anadarko and Carnegie, and resold their work to businesses and individuals. Her breakthrough occurred in 1969 when she mounted a Native art show in the Sales and Rental Gallery at the Oklahoma Arts Center in Oklahoma City. The owner of the S&R; Gallery, Imogene Mugg, took over the next year with the All-Oklahoma Indian Artists Invitational. Between 900 and 1,100 people attended, from 1973 through 1976Daily Oklahoman, July 25, 1976 The show became the largest Native art show in central Oklahoma prior to the launch of the Red Earth Native American Cultural Festival. Also in 1969, Doris divorced Bob McCabe and married jewelry dealer, Mel Littrell. Their marriage did not last and eventually was annulled. Before and after, she continued to work with McCabe, marketing Oklahoma Native paintings throughout central Oklahoma, and in New Jersey, Washington, D.C., Colorado, Arizona, and California. Mid career Littrell opened Oklahoma Indian Art Gallery in 1979 after her retirement from Southwestern Bell. By that time, she had expanded her repertoire well beyond Southern Plains paintings. The gallery featured works by Dennis Belindo, Joan Brown, Joan Hill, Barthell Little Chief, Lee Joshua, Gary Montgomery, Bill Rabbit, Bert Seabourn, Brenda Kennedy Grummer, and numerous others. She also handled sculpture by Sherman and Allie Chaddlesone, Charley Pratt, Bill Haney, and Ted Creepingbear. Some of the state's most prominent cultural brokers frequented her business, including David and Molly Shi Boren, Drew Edmonson, and Oklahoma Arts Council Director Betty Price. Littrell was largely responsible for the brief commercial success enjoyed by Mirac Creepingbear prior to his premature death. She also played a decisive role in the careers of Merlin Little Thunder and Robert Taylor. In 1990, Congress passed the Indian Arts and Crafts Act which made it a felony for a non-tribal member or designated artisan to identify as a Native American artist. The act was intended to protect the economic interests of Native individual artists, cooperatives, organizations and tribes from individuals or companies at home and abroad who falsely claimed to sell Indian products. In Oklahoma, it had additional consequences, particularly for artists descended from but not enrolled in the Five Tribes—Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Muscogee Creek and Seminole—whose membership is based exclusively upon the Dawes Rolls. Artists who could not prove descent from those rolls, despite their ancestry claims, possessed no political status as Indians and hence could not represent their art as Indian made. Although Littrell only handled a few unenrolled artists, she closed her gallery briefly in the aftermath of the bill and eventually reopened, like other Oklahoma galleries, with a disclaimer. In 2004, Litrell was honored with the Governor’s Arts Award. Her gallery closed in 2010, after a series of downsizings, and she retired to Plainview, Texas.

She is well known for her unique jewelry, a talent she developed at the Institute of American Indian Art. Early life Heidi BigKnife was born in Enid, Oklahoma and grew up in Denver, Colorado, where her Shawnee mother worked in the interior design field. Her father trained pilots at the Vance Air Force Base in Enid while in the service; he later worked as a commercial pilot. She is enrolled in the Shawnee Nation. BigKnife has said her career was influenced in her childhood by her mother's artistic eye. She remembers doing countless arts and crafts projects with her mother, and developed the skill to \\"create something out of nothing.\\" While in grade school, BigKnife was placed in a gifted and talented program through which she was afforded the opportunity to tour various museums and view art that she would not otherwise have seen. In junior high, BigKnife enrolled in the drafting and shop classes to learn more about making items; she was the only female in the classes. During her high school years, BigKnife developed a love for photography that she carried into college, where she studied more. Shawnee on her mother's side, BigKnife began to be more aware of her heritage and identify as Shawnee during her college years. After graduating from the Institute of American Indian Arts, she adopted her maternal grandmother's maiden name, BigKnife, as her surname. Education After graduating from high school, BigKnife attended Beloit College in Beloit, Wisconsin. BigKnife received a Bachelor of Studio Arts degree (photography concentration) from Beloit. In the early 1990s, BigKnife earned an associate degree in two- and three-dimensional design from the Institute of American Indian Arts in Santa Fe, New Mexico. She continued to study photography at the Institute under Meridel Rubenstein and took her first jewelry class with Lane Coulter. She attended the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign (1993-1995), where she studied color photography, digital imaging, and videography. Style and notable works BigKnife works in jewelry design, often gathering found items for inspiration.

In his early career, he published comic book art and realistic pieces, as well as commercial art. He has won multiple awards for his artworks. An alumnus of Oklahoma City University, the school awarded him the honorary degree of Doctor of Humane Letters in 1997. Early life Bert Dail Seabourn was born on July 9, 1931, at home in Redbarn, Pecos County, Texas to James Augustus Seabourn and F. Leeper Thompson. On July 10, his family took him to the nearest hospital in Iraan, Texas to obtain a birth certificate, causing Iraan to be listed as his place of birth. At the age of 5, Seabourn began to create cartoons, a passion he retained through his high school years.Seabourn, Bert. Oral History Interview with Bert Seabourn. Native Artists Oral History Project (Oklahoma State University), 28 July 2020. He attended McCamey school from first through sixth grades before moving to Alma, Arkansas and subsequently to Van Buren. In 1944, Seabourn’s seventh grade year, his family moved to Purcell, Oklahoma where he attended junior high and high school. That year Seabourn’s father would move to California alone, and eventually Seabourn’s parents would divorce, leading to his loss of contact with his father. In the eighth grade, Seabourn sold one of his cartoons to the King Features Syndicate, and the cartoon was then published in an actual comic book. He would later attend Purcell High School and receive his diploma in 1950 having taken no formal art courses. Though he attended college for a short time in Tishomingo, Oklahoma, he put his education on hold to marry Bonnie Jo Tompkins. In 1955 he began night school at Oklahoma City University. While studying at the university, Seabourn worked as a freelance artist for companies such as Southwestern Bell and Oklahoma Today Magazine. Seabourn also began working for Oklahoma Gas and Electric Company, where he would maintain a position for twenty-three years. In 1961, Seabourn graduated from Oklahoma City University (OCU) with a Certificate of Art. In 1997, OCU granted him the honorary degree Doctor of Humane Letters. Military service Seabourn joined the Navy in Oklahoma City, in November 1950 after he noticed friends being drafted at the start of the Korean War. He left for San Diego in March 1951, leaving behind his wife who was expecting their first child, Connie. During his time in the Navy, Seabourn created training brochures that included illustrations of how to evacuate, how to enter and exit a plane, as well as how to put on an inflatable life vest. He later became the art director for the Navy’s monthly magazine for two years before being transferred to Pearl Harbor. At Pearl Harbor, Seabourn was surrounded by artists, journalists, photographers, and writers, who were all shipmates in the Sincpack Fleet. The Sincpack Fleet completed work requests for various ships at sea. While in the Navy Bert’s art was also published in many magazines to which he submitted cartoons. He also completed his first full-time art project—painting the mess hall. Artistic style and notable works Seabourn’s painting style evolved over the span of his education. Bert began with cartoon-style works at a young age and kept this style through his high school years. Until he began studying at Oklahoma City University, his works were naturalistic, that is, reflected observed reality. But at OCU, he was inspired by painter and instructor Roger White. After some time studying under White, Seabourn experimented with abstract painting. Abstract expressionism became the style for which Seabourn was to be known. Along with the abstract aspect of Seabourn’s art, he is also known for Native American subject matter of his works. Seabourn was inspired to pursue American Indian subjects after a visit to the Indian Annual, a juried art show at Tulsa’s Philbrook Museum of Art, but he wanted to try a different approach than the Flatstyle art that was then popular. Seabourn was an active part of the Native American art world until the passage of the Indian Arts and Crafts Act in 1990. As a person of Native American descent with no Certificate of Degree of Indian Blood to prove descent from any Cherokee tribe, it is illegal for Seabourn to publish claiming to be an Indian Artist.\\"Of kitsch and kachinas: a critical analysis of the Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990.\\" The Free Library.\\" Retrieved Jun 27, 2015. One of Seabourn’s notable works is Wind Walker, a bronze sculpture that stands 23 feet tall and was unveiled in 1988.

Features alt=An orange version of the Visual Studio Code logo for the insiders version of Visual Studio Code Visual Studio Code is a source-code editor that can be used with a variety of programming languages, including Java, JavaScript, Go, Node.js and C++. It is based on the Electron framework, which is used to develop Node.js Web applications that run on the Blink layout engine. Visual Studio Code employs the same editor component (codenamed \\"Monaco\\") used in Azure DevOps (formerly called Visual Studio Online and Visual Studio Team Services). Instead of a project system, it allows users to open one or more directories, which can then be saved in workspaces for future reuse. This allows it to operate as a language-agnostic code editor for any language. It supports a number of programming languages and a set of features that differs per language. Unwanted files and folders can be excluded from the project tree via the settings. Many Visual Studio Code features are not exposed through menus or the user interface, but can be accessed via the command palette. Visual Studio Code can be extended via extensions, available through a central repository. This includes additions to the editor and language support. A notable feature is the ability to create extensions that add support for new languages, themes, and debuggers, perform static code analysis, and add code linters using the Language Server Protocol. Visual Studio Code includes multiple extensions for FTP, allowing the software to be used as a free alternative for web development. Code can be synced between the editor and the server, without downloading any extra software. Visual Studio Code allows users to set the code page in which the active document is saved, the newline character, and the programming language of the active document. This allows it to be used on any platform, in any locale, and for any given programming language. Language support Out-of-the-box, Visual Studio Code includes basic support for most common programming languages. This basic support includes syntax highlighting, bracket matching, code folding, and configurable snippets. Visual Studio Code also ships with IntelliSense for JavaScript, TypeScript, JSON, CSS, and HTML, as well as debugging support for Node.js. Support for additional languages can be provided by freely available extensions on the VS Code Marketplace. Data collection Visual Studio Code collects usage data and sends it to Microsoft, although this can be disabled. In addition, because of the open-source nature of the application, the telemetry code is accessible to the public, who can see exactly what is collected. According to Microsoft, the data is shared with Microsoft- controlled affiliates and subsidiaries, although law enforcement may request it as part of a legal process. Reception In the 2016 Developers Survey of Stack Overflow, Visual Studio Code ranked #13 among the top popular development tools, with only 7.2% of the 46,613 respondents using it.

In the same year and in a voluntary capacity, Crick joined the Geological Department of the Natural History Museum, London. At the Natural History Museum Crick was commissioned to catalogue the fossil Cephalopoda (Belemnites and the Ammonites) and ‘throwing his whole heart into the work left it one of the best arranged and indexed collections’ at the Museum. He was appointed a First Assistant of the Museum in 1904. In the course of his career Crick wrote sixty-seven papers that were published in various scientific journals including seven written in association with Arthur Humphrys Foord and one with Richard Bullen Newton who was also a first assistant at the Natural History Museum.

Cornshucker is known for his high-fire stoneware, decorated with hand-painted, Native-inspired motifs and designs. Early life Born and raised in Jay, Oklahoma, and a member of the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians, Cornshucker was inspired by other artists in his family including his grandfather, Lincoln Trotting Wolf's, talent for weaving. His grandfather built his own rug loom on which he made rugs and blankets on the front porch. Cornshucker's cousins were basket weavers and his father was a silversmith, allowing him several creative outlets in his youth. Cornshucker spent many summers with his Cherokee family in Jay. He had positive encouragement in public schools when he began making figurines out of wet plaster and metal sculptures. Education After graduating high school in 1970, Cornshucker briefly attended Bacone College in Muskogee, Oklahoma before transferring to Southwest Baptist University in Bolivar, Missouri working to become a tribal lawyer. It was during this time, Cornshucker took college art class which sparked his interest in pottery. Cornshucker was hired in 1975 to work as an apprentice potter in the Missouri theme park, Silver Dollar City. This job opportunity allowed him a lot of room to grow because he was perfecting his art every day for three to four hours for tourists. He left Silver Dollar City in 1977 and moved to Colorado where he became a land surveyor. After six months, Cornshucker moved back home to set up his own studio in Kansas City, Missouri. Career When Cornshucker set up in his own studio, he began to compete in more booth shows as well as galleries. When Cornshucker began to do more Native shows, he experienced an increase in the amount of galleries taking on his work. In the early 1980s, Cornshucker would do approximately 15-16 gallery shows per year. Cornshucker also began incorporating his trademark Native motifs on his pottery around this time. The dragonfly was a special symbol for him not only because of its symbolism for many tribal cultures, but also because of its association with his grandfather, Lincoln Trotting Wolf. Cornshucker is also part owner of the Brady Artists Studio with Donna Prigmore. In 2007, Cornshucker was selected to participate in a cultural exchange with African artists, put on by the Kellogg Foundation in tandem with the Institute of American Indian Arts of Santa Fe. Cornshucker worked in a Zulu village and put on a workshop for the Zulu potters. The goal of this program was for the American potters to offer tips and advice on how to better market the Zulu potters' work. Cornshucker helped influence the creation of clay masks and rattles to be sold in the markets. Collections Cornshucker is considered a modern potter who values the functionality of his pieces while aesthetically including Native American motifs in his signature designs. He strives to create pieces that communicate past and present Native American spirit which reflects his heritage and honors the creativity of man over time. He has shown his work in a variety of nationally significant markets, including the Eiteljorg Indian Market and Festival, the Sante Fe Indian Market, the Pueblo Grande Museum Indian Art Show in Phoenix, and the Contemporary Indian Art Show at Cahokia.

His paintings express the history, people and the land in a narrative, representational style, especially from the perspective of the Southern Cheyenne people. He is well known for his miniature paintings, bright colors, and for the incorporation of humor into his work. After graduating from high school in Canton, Oklahoma, Merlin attended several colleges and universities to major in other subjects, yet he continued to learn art on the side. The young man married before graduating with a degree, quit college and began working in a factory. His father opposed his desire to become a full-time artist because he feared his soon would be unable to support himself, let alone a family. But by 1981, Merlin and his wife had divorced, and Merlin moved to Tulsa, where he became more deeply involved in his art. Early life Born in Clinton, OK at the Clinton Indian Hospital, Little Thunder was raised in the town of Canton, Oklahoma, in the Southern Cheyenne community of Fonda. His great-grandfather, Frank Old Bear, performed with the Miller 101 Ranch Wild West Show. His uncle, Raymond Williams, was an amateur artist who could look at something once and then reproduce it but never turned his talent into a career. Little Thunder described growing up in Canton as \\"an Indian kid's paradise.\\" Education Little Thunder's parents were George and Connie Little Thunder.\\"Merlin Little Thunder:Southern Cheyenne Artist.\\" Accessed August 19, 2018. Merlin went to Longdale Elementary and then moved to Okmulgee, OK and went to Lee School while his father, George, attended Okmulgee Tech on the GI Bill. After his father finished school the family eventually moved to Enid, OK and Little Thunder attended Adams and then Harrison Elementary. Eventually his family moved back to Canton and Little Thunder returned to Longdale through the eighth grade and then graduated from Canton High School in 1975. After graduation from high school, Little Thunder began taking classes at Southwestern Oklahoma State College (SWOSU) in 1975, while majoring in pre-pharmacy. Little Thunder transferred to Bacone College in Muskogee, Oklahoma in 1976 because he wanted a smaller setting, still majoring in pre-pharmacy. When he transferred to Eastern Oklahoma State College in Wilburton, Oklahoma, he changed his major to art. He left college in 1980 for factory work. Later Little Thunder moved to Tulsa and met Jim Hewlett, a collector of Indian art, who bought drawings and paintings from Little Thunder and gave him space to work. Little Thunder indicates that demand for his artwork became so strong that he gave up factory work and became a full-time artist about 1981. He met the owner of an Oklahoma art gallery, Julie Pearson, whom he soon married. Collections Little Thunder is best known for his miniature work. These are finely detailed, though they are physically tiny, as small as 1¼ by 2½ inches. He describes his art as coming from a spiritual experience which spurred his drawing and focuses on Cheyenne subject matter painted largely from memory. Humor is very important in Little Thunder's work and likes his work to \\"poke fun at history.\\" Little Thunder is known for landscapes with 19th century Cheyenne subjects. He is also known for medicine paintings which he describes as more spiritual in nature and without artistic limitations. He has developed a reputation for his 1950s period work inspired by his great grandfather’s experiences riding in cattle drives and performing with the 101 Ranch show. Little Thunder's artwork can be seen in the collections of the Fred Jones Jr. Museum of Art, the Sam Noble Oklahoma Museum of Natural History, the National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum, and the Museum of the American Indian. Famous Artworks The following is a list of a few of Little Thunder's famous works of art: *\\"Tornado warning at 3 a.m.\\" depicts his grandmother, Daisy Little Thunder, and her family rushing into a cellar to escape a tornado *\\"Keeping an eye on the defense secretary\\" which depicts a humorous, fictional event inspired by press reports of Defense Secretary Nominee John Tower’s drinking problem.

It generally follows the Dutchess–Putnam county line along the latter's northwest corner, from the banks of the Hudson River near Breakneck Ridge to North Highland, just south of the county line in Philipstown. At in length it is the longest trail in the Hudson Highlands State Park system; although parts of the trail are on other public and private parcels in the area. It is rarely hiked in its entirety. Portions are used as part of common loop routes in the area, such as Breakneck Ridge near its west end and Fishkill Ridge at its east. Popular destinations served by the trail include Sugarloaf Mountain, a peak near the western end that offers panoramic views over the river and surrounding peaks, and Scofield Ridge, at not only the highest point along the trail but also in all of Putnam County, near the east end. Route The western trailhead is located along New York State Route 9D in the town of Fishkill, just north of the county line. It is across from the parking lot for the nearby Breakneck Ridge trailhead and the short path to the Breakneck Ridge station, where trains on Metro-North Railroad's Hudson Line stop on weekends, bringing many hikers to the trails in the vicinity. The trail uses yellow as its blaze color, either in the form of rectangular daubs of paint or circular plastic markers. From Route 9D, just above sea level at the nearby Hudson River, the trail begins a gentle climb in a generally north-northeast direction along an old woods road, making a long switchback and then following a wide streambed more directly uphill. At a half-mile (800 m) from the trailhead, the red-blazed Breakneck Bypass Trail, a route to that mountain's summit which avoids the steep climb followed by the Breakneck Ridge Trail up the west face, branches off to the northeast. Shortly after the junction an unofficial trail branches off to the northeast, allowing those who wish to follow it the opportunity to skip the impending ascent of Sugarloaf Mountain, sometimes called Sugarloaf North to distinguish it from Sugarloaf Hill, which also overlooks the Hudson roughly 10 miles (16 km) to the south near Garrison in Putnam County. After the fork the Wilkinson descends slightly, then begins to climb the steep south face of Sugarloaf. Tight switchbacks take the trail through narrow rock chutes in the nearly vertical slope. alt=A view of a wide river from high above.

In the foreground is a gnarled wooden tree After the climb, almost another half-mile, the trail reaches a viewpoint on the south end of Sugarloaf's summit plateau. To the south is a panoramic vista over the river, with Breakneck Ridge and Storm King Mountain on the other side predominating. Just below is Bannerman's Island, site of a former arsenal and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The trail passes over Sugarloaf's summit in the middle of a wooded area before reaching another viewpoint on the north end, looking toward Beacon Mountain, the city of Beacon and the Newburgh- Beacon Bridge that carries Interstate 84 over Newburgh Bay to Newburgh, also visible. Afterwards the trail turns sharply. In contrast to the south face of Sugarloaf, the descent from the north side is gentler, following a long traverse southeast, east and then northeast down to roughly in the Wades Brook valley. It then begins to ascend gently alongside the brook, crossing it one mile (1.6 km) from the summit of Sugarloaf. It then turns north and steepens into a ascent of an unnamed summit. After 0.3 mile (400 m), the trail levels out for about the same distance, then makes a climb to a summit, the highest elevation it reaches in Dutchess County. There is another viewpoint to the north and west similar to that from the north end of Sugarloaf. A steep descent takes the trail off the summit and out of the state park. For the next mile it follows an easement over private land. Shortly after crossing the land boundary, the blue-blazed Notch Trail joins the Wilkinson at a three-way junction. The two trails run concurrently as they descend steadily over the next half-mile to Squirrel Hollow Brook, where they turn west abruptly, then cross. Just after the crossing, the Wilkinson veers off to the northeast. It remains generally level, curving away from the brook over its next 0.3 mile then southeast back toward it. At the brook, it intersects another trail—the white-blazed Breakneck Ridge Trail. The two briefly merge, following a northeast heading. Just before re-entering the state park, they diverge again. The Wilkinson Trail stays close to the brook, gently ascending as it follows the stream's headwaters northeast to the county line. A moderate ascent along the boundary continues in a northeast direction for until it turns more easterly and crosses into Putnam County for the first time. Shortly afterward, the red-blazed Casino Trail terminates at a junction on the northwest side. The county line also brings the trail once again into private land, this time the property of the Lake Valhalla homeowners' association in the valley to the southeast, also listed on the National Register as a historic district. The trail veers to the southeast, then sharply back to the northwest as it climbs the first of Scofield Ridge's three summits. All reach in elevation, making the mountain Putnam County's highest. There are viewpoints at both ends of the first knob, allowing views over Lake Valhalla itself to the southeast and Fahnestock State Park beyond to the southeast; Beacon Mountain's two summits, including the South Beacon, highest peak in the Hudson Highlands, dominate the view from the other end. Similar views are available from the other knobs. It takes approximately a mile for the trail to go over Scofield Ridge. Midway along the northernmost summit, it crosses back into Dutchess County. This tract of land is the Fishkill Ridge Conservation Area, owned and managed by the nonprofit Scenic Hudson. It takes a long switchback down the steep slope to the northeast, then back southwest, where a view opens up to the northwest. At the end of the next traverse, a short path leads to another overlook. From there the trail continues its steep, switchbacked descent to the col between Scofield and Lambs Hill just to its north. At Dozer Junction, so named for the old bulldozer a short distance away, a blue-blazed connector trail leads uphill a short distance to the Fishkill Ridge Trail as the Wilkinson follows an old road to the east, which continues as the Fishkill Ridge Trail after a quarter-mile. The Wilkinson turns east-southeast and begins to descend, again entering private property. A long switchback takes the trail back into Putnam County. It takes another long switchback as it follows the valley of an unnamed stream. At the bottom of this slope, it veers northeast again, alongside the conservation-area boundary as it briefly returns to Dutchess County, following the north side of a small pond on the county line. It then returns to Putnam County for its remaining quarter-mile descent to its eastern trailhead, at the gated end of Reservoir Road, a short distance from U.S. Route 9. History The trail is named for Samuel Wilkinson, a dedicated trail builder and maintainer who later became president of the New York–New Jersey Trail Conference, whose volunteers maintain the trail.

If it can take on two particular real values such that it can also take on all real values between them (even values that are arbitrarily close together), the variable is continuous in that interval. If it can take on a value such that there is a non-infinitesimal gap on each side of it containing no values that the variable can take on, then it is discrete around that value.K.D. Joshi, Foundations of Discrete Mathematics, 1989, New Age International Limited, , page 7. In some contexts a variable can be discrete in some ranges of the number line and continuous in others. Continuous variable A continuous variable is one which can take on an uncountable set of values. For example, a variable over a non-empty range of the real numbers is continuous, if it can take on any value in that range. The reason is that any range of real numbers between a and b with a, b in mathbb{R}; a eq b is infinite and uncountable. Methods of calculus are often used in problems in which the variables are continuous, for example in continuous optimization problems. In statistical theory, the probability distributions of continuous variables can be expressed in terms of probability density functions. In continuous-time dynamics, the variable time is treated as continuous, and the equation describing the evolution of some variable over time is a differential equation. The instantaneous rate of change is a well-defined concept. Discrete variable In contrast, a discrete variable over a particular range of real values is one for which, for any value in the range that the variable is permitted to take on, there is a positive minimum distance to the nearest other permissible value. The number of permitted values is either finite or countably infinite. Common examples are variables that must be integers, non- negative integers, positive integers, or only the integers 0 and 1. Methods of calculus do not readily lend themselves to problems involving discrete variables. Examples of problems involving discrete variables include integer programming. In statistics, the probability distributions of discrete variables can be expressed in terms of probability mass functions. In discrete time dynamics, the variable time is treated as discrete, and the equation of evolution of some variable over time is called a difference equation. In econometrics and more generally in regression analysis, sometimes some of the variables being empirically related to each other are 0-1 variables, being permitted to take on only those two values. A variable of this type is called a dummy variable. If the dependent variable is a dummy variable, then logistic regression or probit regression is commonly employed.

A few Ghanaian Raglife artists include 4nky Boy, Waxy Buky, Stonebwoy, and Samini. Raglife can be described as dancehall music and often differs from Highlife music due to this distinction. It uses quick drum beats and traditional reggae instruments and melodies to keep the crowd moving. Many songs are performed in English. Ghanaian Raglife has not grown as popular as Hiplife in the last decade. This could be due to the Ghanaian people’s general lack of interest in reggae beats and its slight deviation from popular Hiplife music. In 2013 the Bass Awards were launched in Accra, Ghana.

They play in the First Croatian Rugby league. Founded in 1954 as Hrvatski Akademski Ragbi Klub Mladost, they are the oldest rugby club in Croatia and have been responsible for introducing rugby to the Region. The club is part of the academic sports club Mladost. The club was founded on January 17, 1954 at the inaugural meeting in the Great Hall of the Technical Faculty in Zagreb. This date is considered the formal beginning of rugby union in Croatia. The club plays at the Mladost Sports Park in Zagreb. History It all started in 1953 when the part of the athletes and rowers of Mladost conceived the idea of playing rugby, which was known only from stories of those who at the time traveled to the United Kingdom or France.http://www.mladost-rugby.hr/#!onama/c24z1 The first teacher and coach was Nikola Nick Kopajtić who returned to Zagreb from Canada with knowledge about the game and taught students that were willing to learn. At that time they played only friendly matches because there was no official competition. A significant date in the history of the club was 11.29.1954. when the Maksimir stadium in Zagreb before more than 10,000 spectators played its first international match. The game was against a selection of the British occupational forces in Austria (BTA). The result was 14:11 for the guests from Great Britain. For Mladost played: Branko Stimac Vladimir Krišković, Michael Radja, Slavko Mrkoci, Đeki Srbljenovic, Branko Stimac, Ivica Payer, Ziga Marinkov, Rajko Müller, Boris Banašin, Willie Franjković, Boris Korenčić Zivko Skroza, and Branko Arsic. 1957 saw the first organized championship of Yugoslavia, which was won by Team Jedinstva from Pancevo, and Mladost was the runner-up. It is interesting that the Rugby Club Jedinstva was established on the same day as the Croatian Academic rugby club Mladost. The very next year, 1958 Mladost won the Champion Title, and they managed to be vice-champions in 1960, 1962, 1963, 1965, 1972. Mladost played ten times in the finals and won the Cup in 1959, 1961, and 1967. Logo Since 1978, the trademark of HARK MLADOST is the Mladost Mole. In one \\"hand\\" the mole is shown holding a rugby ball, the other is in the air with his fingers in a \\"V\\" sign. Mladost paved the foundation and cemented the history of rugby in Croatia and in neighboring countries. Players of Mladost encouraged the establishment or founded many other clubs in the region. Some include: RK \\"Nada\\" Split (M.Rađa, RK \\"Lokomotiva\\" (Ž.Skroza), RK \\"Zagreb\\" (R.Bartolić), KS \\"ploče\\" (I.Batinović), RK \\"Čelik\\" Zenica-BiH (S.Kapetanović) RK \\"Ljubljana\\" -Slovenia (S.Tartaglia), ARK \\"Zrinski\\" Zagreb (Z.Sumajstorčić), RK \\"Zadar\\" (M.Zubak).

It was founded in Pont- de-l'Arche at the outset of the sixteenth century. A parish church, Notre- Dame-des-Arts is richly decorated, with splendid stained glass windows on the south side, dating to the early seventeenth century, including a renowned original work by Martin Vérel depicting boats being towed (1605). The stalls from Bonport Abbey, the great organ, a gift from Henry IV of France, and a Baroque seventeenth-century altar all further contribute to the richness of the building.  Chronological overview of Notre-Dame-des-Arts  Many of the dates were recorded in the parish fabric accounts; however, these accounts—or at least their transcriptions—likely date to the seventeenth century. The accounts state first that stone was purchased for construction beginning circa 1499-1500. A new chapel was begun in 1501. By 1509 the north nave aisle was completed. Construction progressed on a piecemeal basis through the mid sixteenth century; the nave was probably vaulted by 1543. The vaults and superstructure of the south nave aisle were completed between 1555 and 1558. Plan The plan is streamlined though somewhat irregular. A nave of six bays is flanked to the north and south by aisles. The east end terminates in a massive, projecting polygonal chapel. There is no typical Gothic west façade or transept; entrance to the interior is through the single portal in the southwest corner of the edifice. The interior is oriented towards the massive eastern chapel while the south flank serves as the principal façade. Elevation The interior elevation is very sober like many of the Flamboyant Gothic churches in the region. It consists of two stories: nave arcade and clerestory. The clerestory windows feature dynamic tracery patterns largely composed of mouchettes and soufflets. The nave vaults contrast with the otherwise conservative articulation. These vaults spring from thin continuous moldings before diverging into tiercerons, liernes, and transverse ribs. The north and south aisles feature quadripartite vaults with large pendant keystones. The nave arcade piers all differ from one another, though those on the south side feature tall (c. 5 feet) prismatic bases and continuous moldings. South façade The south façade faces the town while the north closely abutted a large defensive wall. Not surprisingly, this southern façade received the most attention from the architect and sculptors. Indeed, it is richly adorned and features intricate stone carving. Dramatic, steeply-pitched gables intersect a tall balustrade, creating an openwork screen of sinuous stonework. It has been suggested the design recalls the articulation and decoration of the west façade of the highly-influential parish church of Saint-Maclou in Rouen. Significance The design and ornamentation of the south façade is contemporary with other similar construction projects nearby, including the south façade and porch of the parish church of Notre-Dame at Louviers and the south façade of the collegiate church of Notre-Dame at Les Andelys. Together with these monuments, it is a good example of late Flamboyant church construction in the Seine valley between Rouen and Gaillon at the end of the Middle Ages. The south façade of Notre-Dame-des-Arts, while not as complex as Notre-Dame at Louviers, represents a significant investment and was reflective of the return to prosperity in Pont-de-l'Arche after the end of the Hundred Years War.

She has been credited as being a female break dance pioneer and influencing the new generation of B-Girls and B-Boys.  Early life  Garcia was raised in Spanish Harlem by Puerto Rican migrants and showed an early interest in breakdancing, as she saw hip hop performed in her own neighborhood. She states that the cultural norms of her ethnic background contributed to this mindset, stating “being of Latino background there was a difference between what the males could get away with and what the females had to do\\". She has listed her early inspirations as including Iris Chacón, KRS-One, Rita Moreno, Lauryn Hill, and Celia Cruz and used them to help develop her style.  Career  In 1991, veteran breakdancer and later husband Kwikstep took Garcia on as a mentee. She would go on to dance with many crews in New York City that included The Transformers, The Breeze Team, and the New York City Float Committee, where she would eventually earn the nickname 'Rokafella'. Garcia has stated that one of the moments in her career that stood out to her was when she received applause from an audience that had gathered to watch her and others perform, which she said was rare because \\"up until that point since I had minimal eye-catching moves compared to the guys who were street performing.\\" She has also commented that the hip hop scene is traditionally male dominated and that she and other women have received negativity from men who \\"find it hard to accept a woman's participation in a physically demanding genre\\", but that if women \\"stay in the game long enough the skills and the respect always come together.\\" Together with Kwikstep, Garcia co-founded the non-profit hip-hop dance company Full Circle Productions, which aims to empower young dancers through the positive impact of hip-hop. She has performed for Full Circle and also serves as a teacher. She has also served as a judge for The International Battle of the Year.

On its borders stand many buildings registered on the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship Heritage List. Location Theatre Square is located in the heart of Bydgoszcz: it is delimitated by the following streets: * Karmelicka, to the West; * Ferdinand Foch to the North; * Mostowa to the East; * Brda river to the South. It is situated on the northern edge of Bydgoszcz Old Town, and acts as linkage with Bydgoszcz Downtown district, located to north of the river. On the eastern frontage of the square are located urban houses built between the late 19th centuries and the beginning of the 20th century. History The first buildings in the area of the current Theatre Square appeared at the end of the 14th century: it was St. Mary's Church of the Carmelites and their monastic buildings. Bydgoszcz Theatre ca 1900 In the middle of the 16th century, both the monastery and church have been rebuilt using bricks, the convent was surrounded by a wall part of the defense system of the city. The road leading to the Baltic harbour of Gdansk was controlled by the now gone \\"Gate of Dantzig\\" (north of the actual square). Secularization ordered in 1816 by Prussian authorities reshuffled this layout. Facades on eastern side of the square In 1822 the church of the Carmelites was razed, and on the place was built the first theatre building. Since then, the area has always borne the actual name, Theatre Square (\\"Plac Teatralny\\"). The building had a chaotic life: destroyed by a fire in 1835, it has been rebuilt and burned again in 1890. In 1895, finally, has been erected the Municipal Theatre, designed by Berlin architect Heinrich Seeling. During this construction, the last relic of the Carmelite monastery -a Gothic tower- has been demolished. \\"The Archer\\" in its original place on Theatre Square In 1888 the square witnessed the first horsecar: 2 lines joined there. In 1896, a railway network was established to run powered trams. In the beginning of 1901, a 3rd line was added: the Square became the largest interchange in Bydgoszcz. On the eve of World War II, four tram lines were running through the place on daily basis. It lost its importance in 1953 when a new interchange in the district of Babia Wieś was set up. Rail tracks from the north-south lines have been liquidated in 1974, since then, trams run through the square on an east-west axis, along its northern frontage (Ferdinand Foch Street). In the garden along the banks of the Brda river was a popular café called \\"Theatre\\" ( \\"Teatralną\\"). In a nearby square, on 18 October 1910, has been unveiled the sculpture The Archer ( Łuczniczka) by Berliner Ferdinand Lepcke, considered as one of the symbols of Bydgoszcz. After World War II, the masterpiece has been moved to a public garden nearby Gdanska street. The reconstruction of the Municipal Theatre has been an opportunity of a modernization of the square. The eastern frontage was rebuilt in 1893-1912, with Neo-Baroque and Modern houses, and a partial modernization also was performed along facades onto Mostowa Street and Focha. During interwar period, Theatre Square was one of the most important and most prominent in Bromberg, and it would be displayed on many postcards and in works of local artists. In 1937-1938, the square underwent another renovation. In 1945, during the battle for the liberation of the city, the Municipal Theatre has been was hit by shells its interiors burned down. Municipal authorities, mistakenly associating the Theatre with German culture, had it demolished. Since then, Theatre Square lacks the building from which it derives its name. Eventually, after demolition, the area has been planted with grass and in 1959-1961 the square was extended and it took its current shape, moving out The Archer sculpture further north in Gdanska Street. Denomination The square had the following names: * 1872-1920- Theater- Platz; * 1920-1939- Theater Square; * 1939-1945- Theater-Platz; * 1945-1949- Theater Square; * 1950-1956- Plac Wyzwolenia (Liberation Square); * 1956-1990- Plac Zjednoczenia (Unity Square); * Since 1990 Theatre Square. Current status The Square is partially used in the western part (parking lot), and in the eastern part (linking with Mostowa Street). The lawned area, as one of the most exposed places in downtown Bydgoszcz is still waiting for development. City authorities are planning new buildings of high architectural value, in particular an extension of the Opera Nova. On July 19, 2013 two fogging pergolas have been set up.

Constructed around 1870, the establishment ran from 1887 to 1893. Once razed, this plot on the corner of Stary Port Street 1-3 welcomed the project of Joseph Święcicki in 1893 for Julius Rosenthal's heirs, a businessman. The aim was to house a Department store, \\"Hohenzollern\\" and an apartment. The building was completed in 1894, with its Neo-Baroque décor, trademark of Bromberg architect. In 1910, the northern end was razed to build a modern Department store designed by Fritz Weidner. In 2010, a memorial plaque has been unveiled to commemorate dr. Bronisław Koch (1913-1988), a famous local lawyer who lived there. In the 1930s, gables were demolished and decoration moved on the top of the cornice. In 2011, a thorough refurbishing has been performed on the facade, exposing its initial splendor.

He is a retired Colonel of the United States Army and is the state senator for Pennsylvania's 33rd District. A Republican, he previously ran as a candidate for U.S. Representative in before winning a special election in 2019 to replace the retiring Rich Alloway. He has written two books, one of which is a biography of the highly decorated World War I soldier Sergeant Alvin York. He has also led the development of research reports and strategy recommendations for the U.S. Army War College. Military career Mastriano was commissioned in the United States Army in 1986. He started his military career in Nuremberg, Germany, with the 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment in the area of the West German borders with East Germany and Czechoslovakia. Mastriano also served four years at the NATO Land Headquarters in Heidelberg, Germany. While serving along the East German and Czechoslovakian borders, in 1991 he witnessed the dissolution of the Soviet Union and deployed to Iraq for Operation Desert Storm to expel Iraqi forces from Kuwait. His regiment led the attack against Saddam's elite Republican Guard forces. Mastriano then served in Washington, DC, the 3rd Infantry Division and US Army Europe. Mastriano was the lead planner for a planned invasion of Iraq via Turkey that was blocked by Turkey's refusal to use its territory for that purpose, causing the 2003 invasion of Iraq to be carried out by a different approach. He served four years with NATO and deployed three times to Afghanistan. Mastriano was the director of NATO's Joint Intelligence Center in Afghanistan, leading 80 people from 18 nations. Mastriano led seven relief operations to help Afghan orphans. He completed his career as a Professor of the U.S. Army War College (PAWC), Carlisle, Pennsylvania, and taught Strategic Studies at the Master Degree level to the next generation of senior leaders. He retired in 2017 at the rank of Colonel. Political career  Elections  = 2018 congressional campaign = On February 13, 2018, at the Otterbein Church in Waynesboro, Pennsylvania, Mastriano announced his candidacy for U.S. Representative for , a seat being vacated by the retiring congressman Bill Shuster. Less than a week after his announcement, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania redrew the congressional district map of Pennsylvania after ruling the previous map unconstitutional (due to gerrymandering by the majority Republican Party), and the area previously covered by the 9th district corresponds most closely to the new 13th district, so Mastriano became a candidate for . Mastriano ultimately finished fourth of the eight candidates in the primary election, receiving a total of 10,509 votes. = 2019 special election for the 33rd senatorial district = On January 22, 2019, Mastriano announced that he intended to run for the State Senate seat being vacated by Rich Alloway in the 33rd District, saying he \\"can't, in good conscience, stand aside\\", wanting to \\"serve his country in a new way\\". Mastriano overwhelmingly won the Republican nomination for the May 21 election at a party conference held in Gettysburg on March 30, 2019. On Mastriano's campaign page, he states that \\"marriage is between a man and woman -- and that no amount of disinformation or political correctness will change these facts\\" Mastriano has also been reluctant to call Pennsylvania Health Secretary Rachael Levine by her preferred pronoun, \\"she\\", and refuses to acknowledge his political opinion on transgender individuals. Val DiGiorgio, the chairman of the Republican Party of Pennsylvania, said \\"Doug Mastriano is the kind of conservative candidate that reflects the values of Southcentral Pennsylvania and will be a key asset in helping advance the Republican agenda in Harrisburg.\\" On May 21, 2019, Mastriano defeated Democrat Sarah Hammond to win the special election in the 33rd District. Mastriano was sworn into the Pennsylvania Senate on June 10. Campaign Facebook page Mastriano had been criticized for posts on his campaign's Facebook page, \\"Doug Mastriano Fighting for Freedom\\", which draws heavily from right-wing social media and web publications. In May 2019, during his campaign for state senate, Mastriano was accused of spreading Islamophobia after sharing several posts on his campaign Facebook page targeting Muslims. \\"Islam wants to kill gay rights, Judaism, Christianity and pacifism\\" read one of the posts, which critiqued the common \\"Coexist\\" bumper stickers. After the Notre Dame fire Mastriano had shared an image that was circulated in the wake of the fire suggesting that it had been an act by Muslim terrorists.https://www.penncapital- star.com/government-politics/conspiratorial-anti-muslim-memes-populate- facebook-page-of-state-senate-candidate/ In April 2018, his campaign Facebook page shared an article headlined, “A Dangerous Trend: Muslims running for office.” While various Democratic critics condemned his Facebook posts, neither Mastriano, the county, nor the state Republican party responded publicly about the issue. After Mastriano's election to state senate, the auditor of Reading Township, located Adams County in Mastriano's district, wrote a letter in The Gettysburg Times in which he criticized Mastriano with claims such as \\"Doug's page is active at seemingly every hour of the day\\", and \\"Whether it is Doug himself or a staffer running the page, does the Mastriano team not have anything better to do? Why is a full-time elected official spending so much of their time on social media interacting with people they don't represent?\\". Mastriano did not respond to the auditor's criticism.  Tenure = COVID-19 policies= On March 17, 2020, Mastriano called for suspension of the HIPAA law to allow the Department of Health share more COVID-19 data, including publishing the names and addresses of those infected with the virus. On March 28, 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Mastriano proposed legislation that would allow Pennsylvania businesses to reopen if they followed CDC mitigation guidelines, subject to health department and law enforcement inspections. Mastriano spoke during an anti-lockdown protest held on April 20, 2020, in support of reopening Pennsylvania during the state's ongoing pandemic. On May 11, 2020 Mastriano called for the resignation of Secretary of Health Rachel Levine stating that he believed she failed to adequately protect nursing home residents. In May 2020 Mastriano wrote a letter signed by other Republican state legislators and a county commissioner calling for his home county of Franklin County to move out of the \\"red\\" phase of Governor Tom Wolf's reopening plan. At the time Franklin County's seat Chambersburg had one of the highest average daily growth rates of COVID-19 cases in the country. Mastriano's initiative was opposed by the mayor of Chambersburg and two county commissioners. In response to a Pennsylvania mask- wearing order, Mastriano called for a mask-burning party at a July 2020 rally in Gettysburg. At a July 22, 2020 rally, Mastriano urged people to reject store employees telling them to wear a mask and \\"tell them to mind your own business and say you're exempt.\\" Published works as author Mastriano's first book, Alvin York: A New Biography of the Hero of the Argonne (), was published by the University Press of Kentucky in 2014. He conducted twelve years of research for the book. In all, Mastriano reportedly spent 2,000 hours doing research on Sergeant Alvin York, including 1,000 hours studying archives in the United States and various parts of Germany including Stuttgart, Freiburg, Potsdam, Rottweil, and Ulm, and another 1,000 hours of field research in the Argonne Forest of France to locate where York fought during the Meuse–Argonne offensive of World War I. Using terrain analysis, geo- spatial data, and field archaeology, his research team uncovered thousands of artifacts related to York's battle of October 8, 1918. He said that his interest in York began during his childhood when he saw the Academy Award- winning 1941 film about York starring Gary Cooper. After Mastriano joined the Army, his interest in York deepened. Along with research, the book incorporates forensic study and military terrain analysis. Mastriano's book on York received the 2015 William E. Colby Award of the William E. Colby Military Writers' Symposium at Norwich University (an award for a first published work of a military topic author), the Army Historical Foundation Award, the US Army War College Madigan Award and the 2015 Crader Family Book Prize in American Values.

Although he did not race until the age of four and never won a major race in his native country he was one of the most financially successful British-trained horses of all-time, winning well over £4 million in prize money. He was trained throughout his career by Luca Cumani and ridden in most of his major races by Ryan Moore. The gelding was suited by extreme \\"hold-up\\" tactics and was usually restrained at the rear of the field before being produced for a late run in the straight. He was rated among the world's hundred best racehorses in 2009, 2010 and 2011. Presvis began his racing career in 2008, winning two of his seven races including a valuable handicap race at Newbury Racecourse. In the following year he raced in Dubai, Hong Kong and Singapore, winning two handicaps at Nad Al Sheba Racecourse and the Queen Elizabeth II Cup as well as finishing second in the Dubai Duty Free and the Singapore Airlines International Cup. His only success in six starts in 2010 came when he won the Jebel Hatta at Meydan Racecourse in March. In the early part of 2011 at Meydan he won the Al Rashidiya and finished third in the Jebel Hatta before recording his most important win in the Dubai Duty Free. He failed to finish better than fifth in his remaining five races. He was retired from racing in 2012 and died later that year. Background Presvis was a bay gelding with a narrow white blaze and white markings on his hind feet bred in the United Kingdom by Mette Campbell-Andenaes. He was from the first crop of foals sired by Sakhee who won the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe and the International Stakes as well as finishing second in The Derby and the Breeders' Cup Classic. His other progeny have included Sakhee's Secret and Tin Horse (Poule d'Essai des Poulains). Presvis's dam Forest Fire was a Swedish- bred mare who won four races in Britain in 1998 and 1999. She was descended from the British broodmare Queen of the Chase, a half-sister of the King's Stand Stakes winner Vilmorin. Presvis was sent to the Tattersalls sale as a foal in November 2004 and was bought for 15,000 guineas by Will Edmeades Bloodstock. A year later, Presvis returned to Tattersalls and was sold for 30,000 guineas to Amanda Skiffington. The horse was subsequently gelded and entered the ownership of Leonidas Marinopoulos. He was sent into training with Luca Cumani at his Bedford House stable in Newmarket, Suffolk. Racing career 2008: four-year-old season Presvis began his racing career as a four-year-old in May 2008 when he finished third in a one-mile maiden race at Haydock Park and then finished fifth in similar events at Thirsk and Haydock. At Sandown Park Racecourse on 17 July he started 3/1 favourite for a ten furlong handicap race and recorded his first win, taking the lead approaching the final furlong and drawing away to win by nine lengths. He then finished second in ten furlong handicaps at Sandown and Newmarket. On his final appearance of the year, Presvis carried 127 pounds in the John Smith's Stakes at Newbury Racecourse on 20 September. Ridden by Ryan Moore he recovered from being hampered in the early stages to take the lead a furlong out and won by seven lengths from Rose Street. In the autumn of 2008, the gelding was strongly fancied for both the Cambridgeshire and the November Handicap but was withdrawn from both races. 2009: five-year-old season In early 2009 Presvis was sent to race in the United Arab Emirates and ran three times at Nad Al Sheba Racecourse, ridden on each occasion by Moore. He won the Al Tayer Motors Trophy by three and a half lengths on 22 January and the Meydan Gate Towers Trophy five weeks later. On 28 March he started at odds of 10/1 for the Dubai Duty Free and stayed on strongly in the straight to finish second of the sixteen runners behind Gladiatorus, with Vodka, Kip Deville, Archipenko (Queen Elizabeth II Cup, runner-up in the Arlington Million) and Paco Boy among the unplaced runners. Presvis was then sent to Hong Kong to contest the Queen Elizabeth II Cup at Sha Tin Racecourse on 26 April. His opponents included the local champion Viva Pataca as well as Archipenko, Thumbs Up (Hong Kong Classic Mile) and Packing Winner (Champions & Chater Cup). Presvis raced last of the ten runners until the straight, when he began to make rapid progress on the inside. He took the lead 100 metres from the finish and won by a length from Viva Pataca, with Thumbs Up taking third ahead of the French-trained Chinchon. After the race Moore said \\"That went perfectly. I was happy to sit in last as the gallop was honest on that ground. I was never worried as he was handling the ground well. When I asked him once he picked up one horse; I knew he'd pick them all up.\\" Cumani commented \\"Presvis showed in Dubai that he belonged in group one company, and he's proved himself today\\". Three weeks later, Previs started favourite for the Singapore Airlines International Cup at Kranji Racecourse. After being restrained in last place he produced a strong late run but failed by a head to overhaul the Brazilian champion Gloria de Campeao. Moore felt that the horse had been an unlucky loser as he had been blocked and unable to obtain a clear run at a crucial stage, whilst Cumani said that he had been unsuited by the course. After a six-month break, Presvis made his first and only appearance of the year in England when he started 4/5 favourite for the Listed Churchill Stakes on the synthetic Polytrack surface at Lingfield Park Racecourse. After being held up in last place he stayed on well in the straight but was beaten three lengths into second place by the Henry Cecil-trained Tranquil Tiger. On his final appearance of the season, Presvis was sent to Hong Kong again for the Hong Kong Cup on 13 December and came from last place in the early stages to finish third behind Vision d'Etat and Collection. 2010: six-year-old season Presvis returned to Dubai in early 2010 for three races at the newly opened Meydan Racecourse. He finished second to Allybar when favourite for the Al Tayar Motors Trophy on the synthetic Tapeta surface on 5 February and then won the Group Two Jebel Hatta on turf a month later, coming from last place to beat the favoured Alexandros by one and a half lengths. Presvis then ran for the second time in the Dubai Duty Free but never looked likely to challenge the leaders and finished eleventh of the sixteen runners behind the 40/1 outsider Al Shemali. In his three other races that year, Presvis finished fifth to Viva Pataca in the Queen Elizabeth II Cup, fifth to Lizard's Desire in the Singapore Airlines International Cup and ninth behind Byword in the Prince of Wales's Stakes at Royal Ascot. 2011: seven-year-old season For the third year in succession, Presvis began his season in Dubai and began his campaign on 27 January with a win in the Group Two Al Rashidiya, coming from last place to take the lead inside the final furlong and winning by almost five lengths from Steele Tango. Cumani commented \\"He did it very, very well. I was very pleased as I thought he would need the race. I’ve not been able to do everything I wanted with him, but he probably knows best now. Ryan gets on with him like a house on fire. I didn’t give him any orders, I just said go out there and do what you normally do\\". On 3 March Presvis attempted to repeat his 2010 success in the Jebel Hatta, but despite producing his customary late surge he finished third behind Wigmore Hall and Poet's Voice. Three weeks later the gelding ran for the third time in the Dubai Duty Free and started 5/1 favourite in a sixteen-runner field. His opponents included Wigmore Hall, the South African mare River Jetez, Mendip, Beauty Flash (Hong Kong Mile) and Debussy. After starting slowly, he took up his usual position at the rear of the field before making progress approaching the straight. He took the lead 100 metres from the finish and won by three quarters of a length from River Jetez, with Wigmore Hall a length and a half away in third. Ryan Moore commented \\"He's a very talented horse; he deserved that. A lot of hard work goes into him in the mornings and this is one for the whole team. They went a good gallop initially, then the pace slackened a bit and he got the gaps when I needed them. Usually, he quickens between horses and he had to fight to beat off the mare\\". Presvis was then dropped in distance to race over one mile for the first time since 2008 and finished sixth in the Champions Mile at Sha Tin, beaten less than two lengths by the winner Xtension. In May he started second favourite for the Singapore Airlines International Cup but after running wide on the final turn he made no impression in the straight and finished tenth of the twelve runners behind the five-year-old Gitano Hernando. 2012: eight- year-old season Presvis ended his racing career with three runs at Meydan in early 2012. He finished fifth behind the Australian-bred Musir in the Al Rashidiya and ninth to the Aidan O'Brien-trained Master of Hounds in the Jebel Hatta. On his final racecourse appearance he contested the Dubai Duty Free for the fourth time but made no impact, finishing fourteenth of the fifteen runners behind Cityscape. Retirement and death Presvis did not race again after his runs in the UAE in early 2012 and was retired to France. In the autumn of the same year he contracted colic and was euthanised on 17 October. Assessment In the 2009 edition of the World's Best Racehorse Rankings Presvis was given a rating of 120 making him the equal 43rd best racehorse in the world. He was given both the same rating and the same ranking in the following year. In 2011 he was yet again given a rating of 120, although his ranking dropped to 59.

Built by the National Mule Memorial Association in 1965, the Memorial is embellished with an official Texas historical marker calling attention to the role of mules in Texas's history and development. Description Until the mid-20th century, the mule was a common sight on American farms. A sterile hybrid of horse and donkey, the mule was credited by owners with highly productive work habits as a draft animal in challenging conditions, especially those associated with plowing furrows in sticky clay soil. The application of the internal combustion engine to farm machinery, starting in the early 1900s, led to the end of use for the mule. Unlike domesticated animals that are fertile, the mule cannot parent its own kind and could not transition from draft animal to rural pet animal. In the mid-1900s, the headcount of mules in the U.S. central states was dropping towards zero. Jackass admirer V. H. Torrance of Austin, Texas lamented the disappearance of the mule from the American scene, and published a call for the vanishing animal to be memorialized. The plea was widely reproduced and found readers throughout Texas. Gil Lamb, owner of radio station KMUL in Farwell, Texas, took up the campaign and added to it a demand that the memorial be placed in Muleshoe. The memorial was dedicated in July 1965. It centers on a representation of Old Pete, who at the time of his reproduction in sculpture was an 18-year-old, 1,100-pound live mule in Muleshoe. Old Pete was rendered in fiberglass by sculptor Kevin Wolf. The statue was invited to and attended the first inaugural of President George W. Bush. The memorial is located adjacent to the Muleshoe Chamber of Commerce on the north side of the Texas Panhandle rural town. The installation is located on U.S. Highway 84.

He served as director of the Stonyhurst College Observatory and contributed to the study of the Sun, including through observing solar eclipses. Life Aloysius Cortie was born in London into a Catholic family. He was sent to study at the Catholic Stonyhurst College in Lancashire. He later taught mathematics and science at Stonyhurst, before training for the priesthood at St. Beuno's College in North Wales, leading to his ordination in 1892. Cortie returned to Stonyhurst to teach, and spent the rest of his life serving the college. He had an interest in music and served as the college's director of music. Cortie developed influenza in 1925, and his health deteriorated leading to his death some weeks later. Scientific work Aloysius Cortie specialised in observing the Sun. He studied sunspots, making daily observations over many years from Stonyhurst whenever weather permitted. He studied the correlation between magnetic storms on the Earth and sunspots, eventually arguing that effects produced by the Sun, and associated with sunspots, extended outwards from the Sun in various directions and sometimes caused terrestrial magnetic storms. Cortie also specialised in observing solar eclipses and took part in a number of eclipse expeditions. He travelled to Spain in 1905, to Tonga in 1911, and to Sweden in 1914. His main objective was to photograph the spectrum of the outer part of the Sun's atmosphere. Cortie observed novae from the Stonyhurst College Observatory. He examined their spectra and measured the spectral lines that were visible. Aloysius Cortie became a prominent member of the British astronomical community. He often gave popular lectures about science. Cortie acted as director of the Stonyhurst College Observatory from the death of Walter Sidgreaves in 1919 until his own death in 1925. He became director of the Solar Section of the British Astronomical Association following the death of Elizabeth Brown in 1899, and served until 1910. He was president of the Manchester Astronomical Society from 1911 to 1925. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1891, and a fellow of the Royal Meteorological Society in 1924. He was appointed an associate of the Astronomical Society of Wales, a form of honorary membership.

In Plungian et al. (eds.), Language. Constants. Variables: In memory of A. E. Kibrik, 105–118. Aleteija: Saint Petersburg.Grenoble, Martinovic, & Baglini (2015) \\"Verbal gestures in Wolof\\". Proceedings of the 44th Annual Conference on African Linguistics. Somerville, MA: Cascadilla Press. The tongue is in a similar position to other click articulations, such as an alveolar click, and like other clicks, the airstream mechanism is lingual. However, unlike other clicks, the salient sound is produced by releasing the rear (probably velar) closure of the tongue rather than the front closure. Consequently, the air that fills the vacuum comes from behind the tongue, from the nasal cavity and the throat. Velar clicks are always voiceless and typically nasal, as nasal airflow is required for a reasonably loud production. IPA symbol withdrawn In 1921, the International Phonetic Association (IPA) adopted Daniel Jones' symbol , a turned lowercase K, for the palatal clicks of Khoekhoe. Jones seems to have first applied the label \\"velar\\" in an IPA publication in 1928. Reprinted in Le Maître Phonétique 3, 6 (23), July–September 1928, . Reprinted in . At the time, little was known about the articulation of clicks, and different authors used different labels for the same sounds – Doke, for example, called the same clicks 'alveolar'.Doke, Clement M. (1925) \\"An outline of the phonetics of the language of the ʗhũ: Bushman of the North-West Kalahari\\", Bantu Studies 2: 129–166. The last mention of the \\"velar\\" clicks was in the 1949 Principles. It was omitted when the other three click letters were moved into the symbol chart in 1951, and was not mentioned again. An actual velar click, in the sense that term is used with the languages of southern Africa, is not possible. A click is articulated with two closures of the tongue or lips. The rear articulation of all clicks is velar or uvular, and the families of dental, alveolar, palatal, and bilabial clicks are defined by the front closure, which is released to cause the influx of air from the front of the mouth that identifies a click. A forward closure in the velar region would leave no room for the air pocket that generates that influx of air.Pullum & Ladusaw (2013) Phonetic Symbol Guide, University of Chicago Press, p. 101. From 2008 to 2015 the unused letter was picked up by the extensions to the IPA to mark a velodorsal articulation in speech pathology. However, velar clicks are possible in the sense that the release sequence of the tongue closures can be reversed: in paralinguistic use in languages such as Wolof, it is the rear (velar) closure rather than front one that is released to produce the sound, and such clicks are termed 'velar'.Florian Lionnet (f.c.) \\"Paralinguistic use of clicks in Chad\\" The IPA letter was resurrected for such sounds, and dropped from the extIPA to avoid confusion with such usage. Production Lionnet describes the clicks as follows: Velar clicks are produced with closed lips in those languages known to have them. For this reason, it was at first thought that the front articulation was labial: However, the labial closure does not appear to be distinctive. Although articulatory measurements have not been done, it appears that the two relevant articulations are dorsal and coronal: The rear articulation appears to be at the very front of the velum, near the hard palate (at least in Wolof and Laal), and the front articulation is dental or alveolar. The lips are closed merely because that is their rest position; opening the lips has no effect on the consonant. That is, the setup of a velar click is very much like one of the coronal clicks, , but with the roles of the two closures of the tongue reversed. In Mundang and Kanuri, the rear articulation is said to be uvular and back-velar rather than front-velar. Comparisons between the languages have yet to be done. Occurrence Paralinguistic velar clicks are attested from a number of languages in west and central Africa, from Senegal in the west to northern Cameroon and southern Chad in the east. The literature reports at least Laal, Mambay, Mundang, and Kanuri in the east, and Wolof and Mauritanian Pulaar in the west. In Wolof, a back-released velar click is in free variation with a lateral click or an alveolar click. It means 'yes' when used once, and 'I see' or 'I get it' when repeated. It's also used for back-channeling. In Laal as well, it is used for \\"strong agreement\\" and back-channeling, and is in free variation with the lateral click. It appears to have the same two functions in the other languages.
