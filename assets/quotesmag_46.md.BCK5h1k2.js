The union was founded in Liverpool in 1824, and was able to meet openly in Manchester by 1826, despite the Combination Act 1825 severely limiting the role of trade unions; it was one of a very few unions able to operate successfully at the time. The union opposed Chartism, and suspended any branches which attempted to work with the Chartist movement.Arthur Marsh and Victoria Ryan, Historical Directory of Trade Unions, vol.2, pp.60-61 The union had 525 members by 1836, unusually for the time included both skilled and unskilled workers. It was the second largest union invited to amalgamated into the new Amalgamated Society of Engineers in 1851 (after the Journeymen Steam Engine, Machine Makers' and Millwrights' Friendly Society), but voted against, fearing that it would be effectively taken over by the larger union. Instead, it remained independent, growing to 6,000 members by 1891, when it was a founder of the Federation of Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades. The union continued to grow in the 20th-century, reaching 17,800 members in 1914. In 1920, it finally agreed to merge with the ASE and some smaller unions, forming the Amalgamated Engineering Union.

The union was founded on 26 July 1826 in Manchester, when it was known as the Friendly Union of Mechanics. In its early years, it held an annual delegate meeting, which elected a different branch to run the union until the next meeting. It soon changed its name to the Journeymen Steam Engine and Machine Makers' Friendly Society, and focused on campaigning for shorter working hours and better pay for overtime. It also attempted to regulate the trade, by campaigning against the employment of workers who had not completed apprenticeships, and to limit the number of apprentices in the industry.Arthur Marsh and Victoria Ryan, Historical Directory of Trade Unions, vol.2, pp.60-61 The union led an eight-month strike in 1836, which won a major victory in limiting the standard working day to ten hours. This boosted the profile of the union, which had 3,000 members by 1839, when it appointed a secretary for the first time. Initially part-time, the post became full-time in 1845, an unusual step for the period. The London Millwrights Societies merged with the Old Mechanics in 1841, which accordingly added \\"millwrights\\" to its name.Arthur Marsh and Victoria Ryan, Historical Directory of Trade Unions, vol.2, p.44 In 1846, the union's branches in Belfast, Rochdale and Newton-le-Willows began industrial action against piecework and systematic overtime. Several employers took the union's officers to court, and they along with twenty of its members were convicted of conspiracy and illegal combination, and imprisoned. Following national protests, they were released in 1847. This inspired William Allan and William Newton to invite numerous other unions to merge to form one large amalgamated body. This occurred in 1851, when the Old Mechanics dissolved into the Amalgamated Society of Engineers.

There are many other variants and similar phrases in numerous languages. \\"Maneuvering the Apostles\\", which has the same meaning, was derived from this expression. In patchwork, \\"Rob Peter to pay Paul\\" is an alternative name for the Drunkard's Path patchwork block. English folklore has it that the phrase alludes to an event in mid-16th century England in which the abbey church of Saint Peter, Westminster was deemed a cathedral by letters patent; but ten years later it was absorbed into the diocese of London when the diocese of Westminster was dissolved, and a few years after that many of its assets were expropriated for repairs to Saint Paul's Cathedral. However, the phrase was popular even before that, dating back to at least the late 14thcentury. This phrase may have originated in Middle English as a collocation of common namessimilar to, for example, Tom, Dick, and Harrywith the religious connotations accruing later, or alternatively as a reference to Saint Peter and Saint Paul (who are often depicted jointly in Christian art and regarded similarly in theology). One reason for the frequent use of the two names in expressions is the alliteration they form. The aforementioned Peter and Paul were apostles of Christ; both were martyred in ancient Rome and have the same feast day (i.e. the Feast of Saints Peter and Paul on June29th). Today, the feast occurs with minimal notice, but it was widely celebrated within England in the Middle Ages. Many churches there were dedicated to the pair. All of that, combined with the medieval English people being almost universally Christian, made it quite common to hear these names together. \\"Robbing selected Peter to pay for collective Paul\\" is Rudyard Kipling's adaptation of the phrase, used to criticize the concepts of income redistribution and collectivism. Kipling included the expression in his \\"Gods of the Copybook Headings\\", and proposed that it should be featured in \\"catechisms\\" of the Conservative Campaign Headquarters. The lesson of the phrase in his version, and of the poem in general, was that \\"only out of the savings of the thrifty can be made the wage-fund to set other men on the way to be prosperous.\\" See also *Ponzi scheme *Robin Hood  References  English-language idioms English proverbs English words and phrases Saints Peter and Paul Debt ","title":"To rob Peter to pay Paul"},{"id":"52910101","text":"On 18 January 2017, a suicide bomber drove a vehicle filled with explosives into a military camp near Gao, Mali, killing 77 people and injuring at least 115.

It is named after the district where it's located, called Lido (Greek: ŒõŒØŒΩœÑŒø). The arena has been used to host a variety of sports events, such as volleyball, boxing, kickboxing, wrestling and Mixed martial arts, but its primary use is hosting basketball games. It is the home of Ergotelis B.C. of the Greek C Basket League and former home of Irakleio B.C. during its tenure in Greek A1 Basketball League. It is part of the Heraklion National Sports Centre, and is located next to the Pankritio Stadium. It has a seating capacity of 1,400. History The arena was built in 1986. Its current state dates back to 1995, when the arena was partially renovated (e.g. more tiers were added) to be the home of Irakleio B.C., when the team was promoted to the Greek A1 Basketball League, the top tier of the Greek basketball league system. For many years it was the only indoor arena in Heraklion, until the construction of the TEI Indoor Sports Hall in 2004 and primarily that of the Heraklion Indoor Sports Arena in 2007. Due to these newer venues, the Lido Indoor Hall has been considered outdated and inadequate for the city's indoor sports outings, currently being used as the home for Cretan Basket League club Ergotelis. Despite appearances though, the arena surprisingly hosted the 2005 Greek Basketball Cup final contested by Greek basketball powerhouses Panathinaikos and Aris.

In other words, this conception of sacrifice can be seen in the works of most of the thinkers of the post-Kantian tradition. Bubbio argues that the very possibility of a ‚Äúrealm of reason‚Äù made up by values and norms depends on the recognition of ‚Äúthe other‚Äù as another human being. Particularly he emphasizes the reciprocal connection of the Hegel's recognition-theoretic approach and his emphasis on kenotic sacrifice, both of which are evidence of his belonging to perspectivism. Bubbio takes this kind of perpectivism as a fundamental feature of the post-Kantian tradition.

It was one of many buildings constructed in Fremantle during the gold boom period in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. The building was completed in 1899, and was opened in 15 March 1899 as the Literary Institute. The architects for the work were Messrs. Wilkinson, Smith, and Wilson, with the main contractor being L. Burness. The building was completed at a cost of ¬£1,528. The two storey building is constructed from brick, render and iron in the Federation Academic Classical style of architecture. The Literary Institute in Fremantle, thought to be the oldest in Western Australia, was established in 1868 from an amalgamation between two private institutions, the Working Man's Association and the Mechanics Institute. It was housed at a number of locations around Fremantle until the gold boom, when many new buildings were constructed around the town. The architects, Wilkinson, Smith, and Wilson, drew up the plan as part of a competition to design the new building. It was opened in 1899 by the Mayor of Fremantle, Elias Solomon; at this time the ground floor housed two shops, a public entrance leading to the main hall and an ante-room on the ground floor. The first floor held the rooms of the Literary Institute. The main hall is recessed from the street with a portico in front. The hall was by with a raised platform at the rear that was deep. The walls were decorated with dado and stencilling. The entrance to the library was on the side up the hall leading to a small passage to the jarrah stairway with turned balusters. On the first floor was the library, librarian's quarters, smoking and chess room, public reading room and a committee room. There was also a balcony surrounding the front of the building. The front elevation has ionic columns as the chief feature on the balcony, which holds a pediment with decorated tympanum. The windows have circular-heads and are divided with doric pilasters with supporting the archivolt. In 1935 the Institute had 481 members and by 1939 there were 385 members using the facilities, which included the 13,000 books stored in the library section. The Institute remained in the building until 1949, when the City of Fremantle acquired the building and used it to house the Fremantle City Council Library. Renovations were carried out between April and September 1949 before the building was reopened as a public library in September by James Battye. The building was renamed the Evan Davies Civic Library, in honour of a local MP, Evan Davies, and has been known as the Evan Davies Building since then. The first floor was for a considerable time the location of the Fremantle Harbour Theatre. In 2015 the building housed a bar on the first floor and a D√¥me caf√© on the ground floor. Later the same year the top floor was vacated and a refurbishment works of the building was undertaken. The Fremantle City Council ordered the works to address essential structural issues and other maintenance work.

The scion of an aristocratic family, he was made to study for a career in the church, but fled Moldavia and studied abroad. Acquainted with the Romanian liberal movement, and an ardent Romanian nationalist, he helped establish bodies of intellectuals dedicated to cultural and political cooperation across the Danubian Principalities and beyond‚Äîincluding, in 1846, the Romanian library of Paris. His purchase of mainly Baroque paintings, donated by him to Academia MihƒÉileanƒÉ, forms the core of the Ia»ôi Museum of Art. With Nicolae BƒÉlcescu and C. A. Rosetti, V√¢rnav also managed the Society of Romanian Students in Paris, whose revolutionary agenda brought him into conflict with European governments. He then played a small part in the French Revolution of 1848, before returning to take orders at Neam»õ Monastery, a Hieromonk and Starets. Throughout the 1850s, he and his brother Constantin, who was the son-in-law of Gheorghe Bibescu, took part in the nationalist movement that established the United Principalities, and was especially active as an electoral campaigner. However, his support of modernization in schools and the church was not welcomed by the religious establishment, and his stand-off with the conservative monks of Neam»õ resulted in the establishment of a dissident monastery. Subsequently, V√¢rnav lost the backing of Domnitor Alexandru Ioan Cuza, although he still approved of Cuza's authoritarian agenda. After campaigning nationally in support of Carol I, V√¢rnav ended his career in Tutova County. Active in antisemitic circles, he was allied with the Free and Independent Faction. On this basis, he contested a seat in the Assembly of Deputies during December 1867, but died after sudden illness just days after winning. Rumors of his poisoning by the Romanian Jews sparked a riot, which had to be quelled by armed intervention, and an official inquiry. He was survived by his brother Constantin and a nephew, engineer and politician Scarlat C. V√¢rnav.

He proposed that the emerging Romanian literature needed to keep cosmopolitan tendencies in check: the predominant themes needed to display \\"originality and Romanianism\\" rather than the \\"illusions of the senses\\" and \\"chimeras of individual hurdles.\\"Isar, pp. 1438‚Äì1439 His focus was on providing young intellectuals with a cultural training that was already in their vernacular language; this included efforts to discard the Cyrillic orthography as \\"foreign\\", and familiarize students with the various adaptations from Latin.Stino, pp. 86‚Äì88.

See also Isar, p. 1436 However, Rosetti and V√¢rnav handled most of daily business, with Ghica effectively absent from Paris after August 1846; in later months, Rosetti also left, to be replaced by Nicolae BƒÉlcescu. This and other concerns prompted the Society to seek patronage from conservative figures in both Principalities‚ÄîNicolae Ghica- ComƒÉne»ôti, Roxanda Roznovanu, Alexandru Sturdza-MiclƒÉu»ôanu, and various others.Bodea, pp. 78‚Äì80, 82, 85 V√¢rnav also offered honorary presidency to the French poet Alphonse de Lamartine who, as he recalled, accepted with \\"the greatest joy and affection\\".Bodea, p. 83; Stino, p. 85 From about 1845, V√¢rnav had been accepted into the Ath√©n√©e des Etrangers, a Masonic lodge of the Grand Orient de France.Marian DulƒÉ, \\"Francmasoneria »ôi Biserica\\", in Revista NouƒÉ, Nr. 3/2011, p. 63 Despite his public overture to the conservative boyars, he had also joined the Wallachians' secret society, FrƒÉ»õia (\\"The Brotherhood\\"), which was repressed at home but maintained a presence in the diaspora; the Society itself may have been a front for Rosetti's revolutionary conspiracy.Bodea, pp. 50‚Äì51 Privately, he expressed his dislike for the patronage, noting that Ghica-ComƒÉne»ôti and the others had surrendered the Society to \\"backbiters\\".Bodea, p. 80 The Society was still highly popular, and, according to ledgers published by V√¢rnav, made a yearly profit of 21,200 francs in subscriptions and donations.Pocitan Ploe»ôteanu, p. 26. See also Iorga, pp. 178‚Äì179 He was able to sponsor scholarships for new recruits to the nationalist cause, including Nicolae Ionescu,Iorga, p. 179 N. Chinezu, and Ianache Lecca.Bodea, pp. 114 V√¢rnav's brother Constantin In Moldavia, Constantin became famous for his advocacy of balneotherapy, and also for his work during the 1848 cholera epidemic: he was the only doctor of Ia»ôi to have survived the calamity. This was particularly unusual, as he did not believe that cholera was contagious, and relied on folk medicine in his attempts to cure it.Iorga, pp. 185‚Äì187 He shared some of Scarlat's views about modernization, publishing his plans to set up a sanitary service and medical schools.Iorga, pp. 182‚Äì186 From 1844, he was also son-in-law of the Wallachian Prince Gheorghe Bibescu,Bodea, p. 268 a conservative figure. Nonetheless, the Students' Society revolutionary connections irritated Bibescu, and also caused concern in Russia, which, at the time, shared custody of the Principalities. Despite Lamartine's support, these developments also worried the French monarchy, which was transitioning to conservatism. The Guizot government chose not to give any recognition to the Society, pushing it into the underground.Bodea, pp. 90‚Äì91. See also Isar, p. 1437 Revolutionary By November 1847, V√¢rnav, BƒÉlcescu, Lecca and Chinezu, alongside Grigore Arghiropol, Dimitrie BrƒÉtianu, Ion C. BrƒÉtianu and Mihail KogƒÉlniceanu, founded the semi-legal √énsocierea LazarianƒÉ (\\"Lazarian Association\\"). Named in honor of Gheorghe LazƒÉr, it had a political project to unify and standardize education in both Principalities.Bodea, pp. 91‚Äì94. See also Isar, pp. 1437‚Äì1439 This agenda was seen as untimely by other intellectuals, including Alexandru G. Golescu, who refused to participate.Bodea, pp. 91‚Äì94 Now openly drawn to radical politics, V√¢rnav became an active participant in the February Revolution, serving in the National Guard. He reportedly tried to cross the border into Moldavia that March, just days before of the abortive liberal revolution; the conservative Prince Mihail Sturdza ordered the border guards to prevent him from doing so. One of his companions, Teodor R√¢»ôcanu, managed to pass through, but soon after had to flee for Wallachia.Gh. Ungureanu, \\"Fram√ÆntƒÉri social-politice premergƒÉtoare mi»ôcƒÉrii revolu»õionare din 1848 √Æn Moldova\\", in Studii. RevistƒÉ de Istorie, Nr. 3/1958, p. 19. See also GhibƒÉnescu (1915), p. 373 V√¢rnav made a return to Bukovina, where other Moldavian radicals had found temporary refuge. He proposed that the library funds be used to sponsor selective clandestine returns to the country; when other Society members argued against this initiative, he promised to pay back the money using his personal assets.Isar, p. 1442 He himself eventually returned to his native country alongside Claude Thions, Consul to Moldavia of the French Second Republic. According to Ion Nistor, V√¢rnav received the title of Postelnic and was advanced to Sublieutenant in the Moldavian Militia;Nistor, p. 535 however, Iorga indicates, these were bestowed upon another Scarlat V√¢rnav, who had remained in Moldavia.Iorga, p. 186 Upon arrival, Moldavian officials asked him to pay storage fees for the Marismas collection, but he was also able to recover it from Gala»õi in 1850.Ichim, pp. 318‚Äì319, 325 He ordered its restoration, and assigned it to Bardasare and Gheorghe Asachi at Academia MihƒÉileanƒÉ.Dimitrescu, pp. 66‚Äì67 It was the basis of the Ia»ôi Museum of Art, which opened for the public in 1860.Dimitrescu, pp. 66‚Äì67; Grigorescu, p. 257; Ichim, pp. 318‚Äì319 In 1850, after only a few months' novitiate,Rosetti, p. 692 the former revolutionary was ordained a monk at Neam»õ Monastery, taking the name Sofronie V√¢rnav (transitional alphabet: Sof—Äonie –ía—Äna–≤ÍôãÃÜ). Described by Iorga as intelligent, charitable and industrious, he was for a while the community's Starets, but apparently also returned to Hili»ôeu, where he enjoyed living among the peasants.Iorga, pp. 179‚Äì181 He still maintained contacts with the Paris Orthodox circles, donating 5,000 ducats to the Romanian chapel,Pocitan Ploe»ôteanu, p. 83 and, with Constantin, ceded a Czernowitz townhouse to the Romanian library of Bukovina, which opened in 1852.Nistor, pp. 529, 531 In 1851, both brothers also sponsored the establishment of a boys' school in Dorohoi.Gh. Amarandei, \\"Vechi institu»õii culturale dorohoiene\\", in Hierasus. Anuar '78, 1979, p. 414 The V√¢rnavs sold their Dorohoi estate over the late 1850s, with Scarlat liquidating all his assets there in December 1857; his land was sold to Eugeniu Alcaz.GhibƒÉnescu (1929), p. 36 As argued by Iorga, the monk was adamantly \\"democratic\\", and from the 1840s proudly listed himself a taxpayer (birnic).Iorga, pp. 175‚Äì176, 180 Similarly, historian Nicolae Isar argues that, by using birnic as his title, V√¢rnav highlighted at once his ideas of self-sacrifice for the greater good and his critique of the boyar class as a drain on Moldavia's budget.Isar, pp. 1441‚Äì1442 From before 1850, V√¢rnav had been affiliated with the National Party, which supported the unification of Moldavia and Wallachia. This prompted speculation that his turn to religion was a ruse for nationalists to have an agent of influence in the clergy.Rosetti, pp. 692‚Äì693 He was again visible in political life shortly after the Crimean War, which inaugurated a series of major changes in Moldavian society. At the time, he openly celebrated Captain G. Filipescu for his defiance of the invading Russian Army, and later sent him a stallion. By June 1856, V√¢rnav was one of the Roman County clergymen who adhered to the National Party's Unionist Committee, which openly advocated the Principalities' merger, and later signed petitions for union's international recognition.Nistor, pp. 534‚Äì535. See also Xenopol, pp. 332‚Äì335 Before the election of July 1857, as \\"Hieromonk Varnav\\", he was a registered elector for the clergy estate in the Diocese of Hu»ôi, while Constantin was registered with the boyars' college at Dorohoi.Iftimi & Iftimi, pp. 97‚Äì98, 100‚Äì102 He endorsed an old friend, Vasile MƒÉlinescu, who became a county delegate to the ad-hoc Divan.Isar, pp. 1440‚Äì1441 The younger V√¢rnav brother published the short-lived gazette Timpul (\\"Times\\"),Iorga, p. 187 and eventually ran in the elections of 1858, representing Dorohoi in the Divan. His campaign was organized by Scarlat, who rallied the peasant voters of Hili»ôeu in church and re-baptized the village rallying point as \\"Union Square\\".Iorga, pp. 179‚Äì180 The Divan's subsequent election of Alexandru Ioan Cuza as Domnitor of the United Principalities was saluted as a major fulfillment in Scarlat's letters to Constantin Hurmuzachi. Described as an \\"independent unionist\\", he agitated in the streets, mocking his 1848 adversary Prince Sturdza, who had stood as a Moldavian-and-separatist candidate for the throne. V√¢rnav quipped that Strudza's royal cypher, M.S.V., stood for Mai StƒÉi Voinice (\\"Whoa There Fella\\"), and thus launched an urban legend.N. Petra»ôcu, Scriitori rom√¢ni contemporani, I: Vasile Alecsandri, pp. 35‚Äì36. Bucharest: Tipografia Bucovina I. E. Torou»õiu, 1930. He introduced several slogans for the unionist cause, which appeared on painted banners; his favorite was: Via»õa, averea, onorul, / Patriei prosternƒÉ Rom√¢nul! (\\"The Romanian to his Motherland / Pledges his life, his fortune, his honor!\\"). This was also featured on his 1859 testament, by which he donated all his belongings to the Paris library.Isar, p. 1441 Church conflicts 1859 cartoon mocking the censorship laws enforced under Alexandru Ioan Cuza Returning to live among the monks of Neam»õ, V√¢rnav involved himself in the controversy over the secularization of monastery estates. Moldavia's Education Minister, Alexandru Teriachiu, assigned him to a reform committee which uncovered great irregularities at Neam»õ, including a dysfunctional seminary and an inhumane ward for the insane.Rosetti, pp. 690‚Äì693 V√¢rnav refurbished the seminary, and then also organized the peasant schools of Neam»õ County, serving as inspector. Proposed innovations he \\"learned at Paris\\", now included the establishment of a printing press and the demolition of new additions to the historical site.Iorga, p. 181 However, he was also suspected of giving away boons, including the monastery's cloth factory and a large press, to his patron KogƒÉlniceanu and to the government itself.Rosetti, p. 693 Such activism, and also his harsh temper,Rosetti, pp. 693, 885 led to numerous complaints. The new minister, Dimitrie RosƒÉt, protected V√¢rnav. He scolded those monks who wanted him tried by church tribunal,B√Ærzu, p. 104 calling them the \\"hirelings of Russia\\".Rosetti, p. 885 V√¢rnav himself had a long-standing feud with Hieromonk Andronic Popovici, whom he accused of using sermons to promote anti-Cuza sentiments and Russophilia. In September 1861, he obtained Popovici's demotion,B√Ærzu, pp. 104‚Äì105 prompting the latter to cross over into the Bessarabia Governorate and set up Noul Neam»õ Monastery outside Kitskany. Andronic claimed that this establishment was merely a lavra for the old one. V√¢rnav, who kept the monastery seal on him, did not validate this in writing, but his adversaries either forged or obtained permission from other administrators.Rosetti, p. 897 Eventually, by 1862, Alexandru A. Cantacuzino took over at the ministry and had V√¢rnav arrested.Iorga, pp. 180‚Äì182 V√¢rnav pleaded for his case and petitioned the Divan with letters also taken up in Tribuna Rom√¢nƒÉ gazette. Archimandrite Timotei Ionescu dismissed his defense as fantasy, depicting V√¢rnav as a persecutor of his monks, who had loosely interpreted Cuza's policies in order to suppress dissent at the monastery.Timotei Ionescu, –†e—Å–ø»£n—ÅÍôãÃÜ –ªa –øeti—Üi»£nea Sf-sa–ªe mona—Ö»£–ª»£ƒ≠ Sof—Äonie –ía—Äna–≤ÍôãÃÜ. Ia»ôi: Tiparƒ≠ul Tribuneƒ≠ RomƒÉne, 1862 According to church historian Melchisedec »òtefƒÉnescu, V√¢rnav, being \\"detested by the public and disgraced by prince Cuza\\", settled in Bucharest, \\"providing his services to whoever would need them.\\" He sees the former Starets as an extremist and a heretic, \\"formed in the school of Blanqui, Pyat [and] Rochefort\\".Melchisedec »òtefƒÉnescu, \\"Biseric'a Ortodoxa si Calindariulu\\", in Biseric'a si Sc√≥l'a, Nr. 28/1882, p. 290 V√¢rnav returned to favor in January 1864, when Dimitrie Bolintineanu, who chaired the unified ministry of education, appointed him to a commission that was tasked with assessing calendar reform. However, his name was immediately flagged and stricken out by the Metropolitan Bishop, Nifon RusailƒÉ. V√¢rnav, who was reportedly a delegate to the Elective Assembly in 1864, supported Cuza's anti- parliamentary coup.Ioan C. Filitti, Biserica Sf. Dumitru din Bucure»ôti (Strada Carol), p. 22. Bucharest: Tipografia CƒÉr»õilor Biserice»ôti, 1932 During the incident, he lived in a rented townhouse at Sf√¢ntul Dumitru‚ÄìPo»ôtƒÉ Church in Lipscani, shared with Cuza's uncle Grigore. During the plebiscite of June 1864, organized by the Domnitor, he put up a \\"lit sign\\" reading: Popa V√¢rnav zice da (\\"Father V√¢rnav Says [to Vote] Yes\\"). Also a Cuza loyalist, Constantin V√¢rnav continued to serve on the Princely Court of Justice, where he notably enforced censorship laws against Ionescu de la Brad.Bogdan-DuicƒÉ, pp. 69‚Äì70 1867 campaign and death In early 1866, Cuza and his authoritarian regime were deposed by a \\"monstrous coalition\\", with Carol of Hohenzollern presented as the new Domnitor. There was a plebiscite on his acceptance, during which V√¢rnav traveled as far south as Ploie»ôti and as far north as BacƒÉu, persuading Wallachians and Moldavians alike to vote for Carol (and thus, for a cemented union).Iorga, p. 182 As Calinic Miclescu and others put up separatist resistance in Ia»ôi, he also took an emergency trip there, effectively acting as a negotiator between the two camps.Iorga, pp. 181‚Äì182 He ultimately settled in B√¢rlad in 1867,Antonovici, p. XIV and his last months were spent in Tutova County politics, but also in efforts to furnish the local hospital. According to Melchisedec »òtefƒÉnescu, he also continued to \\"propagate his political and religious heresies\\". With Ion and Constantin Codrescu, P. Chenciu, A. V. Ionescu, and Ioan Popescu, he established a \\"National Liberal Party\\", which functioned as the provincial affiliate of the Moldavian-wide Free and Independent Faction.Antonovici, pp. XIV‚ÄìXV Like other Factionalists, V√¢rnav also involved himself in the debates over the issue of Jewish emancipation, and is described by biographer Dimitrie R. Rosetti as a \\"firebrand antisemite\\". According to a Jewish man's letter, published in L'Echo Danubien, his \\"preaching against the Israelites [was] of the most barbaric kind\\", disturbing the otherwise tolerant mood of Tutova.Loeb, pp. 298‚Äì299 V√¢rnav put himself up as a candidate for the Assembly of Deputies in the election of December 1867, winning a mandate at Tutova's Fourth College. Without ever taking his seat, he died at B√¢rlad, on ,\\"D‚Äìluƒ≠ Redactore al≈≠ dÃ¶iaruluƒ≠ Rom√¢nul≈≠\\", in Romanulu, January 1‚Äì3, 1868, p. 3.

His stomach and intestines were dispatched to Bucharest, for a more in-depth toxicological inquest. Already before his death, rumor spread that his Jewish enemies had poisoned the Starets, and a riot (or attempted pogrom) erupted in the city. As noted by Rosetti, \\"the excitement of the population required intervention of troops sent in from bordering counties, as a safeguard for the Jews, whose lives were being threatened.\\" The same is noted by Iorga: \\"His death was found suspicious, and military measures were taken to curb the anti- Jewish movements.\\" The conspiracy theory was shunned as \\"infamy\\" by the left- liberal daily Rom√¢nul, which noted that \\"ignorance was exploited\\" by \\"the enemies of the country\\"‚Äîboth in Tutova and Ialomi»õa County (the scene of a scandal over allegations of blood libel). However, the paper also played down the riot, reporting that only the local synagogue and a few Jewish houses had been damaged. According to a note of protest signed by 200 notables of B√¢rlad, the riot was started by mourners gathering in front of V√¢rnav's home, located opposite a Jewish establishment; altercations, they claimed, had been provoked by the Jews, who \\"insulted [...] the agonizing patient\\" and \\"threw boiling water before the audience\\". The petitioners asked the Interior Minister Ion BrƒÉtianu not to punish the populace for what it viewed as \\"calumnies by the adversaries of the national cause\\". Alliance Isra√©lite Universelle (AIU) sources tell that V√¢rnav himself had incensed the crowds earlier in the campaign, with endorsement from the »òtefan Golescu government.Loeb, pp. 167‚Äì168, 298‚Äì299 The pogrom, they argue, was attempted by some of the petitioners themselves, and higher authorities, who \\"arrested all the Jews, supposedly to protect them\\", actually \\"facilitated things for the rioters\\"; the investigation of the riot \\"was opened, but carried no effect.\\"Loeb, pp. 167‚Äì168, 298‚Äì300 On February 25, BrƒÉtianu spoke in the Assembly to announce that \\"solely Jews\\" had participated in the riot.Loeb, p. 300 As noted by the AIU, V√¢rnav's death was likely caused by \\"some rather particular disease.\\"Loeb, p. 167 Eventually, he was buried at B√¢rlad later that month, but his belongings, including itemized lists of donations for the Transilvania Cultural Society, were still in police custody by February.\\"Romani'a.

His own son, Scarlat C. V√¢rnav, was by then becoming distinguished as a civil and military engineer. After managing the School of Bridges, Roads and Mines, he also pursued a career in politics with the Junimea constitutionalists in the 1890s. By then, Iorga claims, both his father and uncle had been unduly forgotten. In the interwar period, Iorga took over and revived V√¢rnav's student library, which became the nucleus of a Romanian School in Fontenay-aux-Roses.Nicolae Liu, \\"Cartea »ôi biblioteca, mijloace de cunoa»ôtere »ôi de apropiere √Æn istoria rela»õiilor rom√¢no-franceze\\", in Revista de Istorie, Nr. 3/1985, pp. 293, 299 Notes References 19th-century births 1868 deaths Members of the Chamber of Deputies (Romania) Free and Independent Faction politicians People of the Revolutions of 1848 Romanian Freemasons Romanian monarchists Romanian educational theorists Language reformers Romanian activist journalists Romanian propagandists Romanian librarians Romanian art collectors Romanian book and manuscript collectors Romanian conservationists 19th-century philanthropists Romanian philanthropists Romanian Orthodox monks Romanian Orthodox priests Starets Romanian civil servants People from Boto»ôani County Moldavian nobility Romanian expatriates in France University of Paris alumni ","title":"Scarlat V√¢rnav"},{"id":"52910319","text":"Nina Wallet Intalou (born 1963) is a Malian businesswoman and politician who has served as Minister of Crafts and Tourism since July 2016.

It is built on a promontory overlooking the plains of Montauroux. The chateau is surrounded by a park with a chapel dedicated to St Anne. The ensemble dates from the middle of the 19th century and was entirely redesigned by Christian Dior from 1950. It has been the property of Parfums Christian Dior since 2013 and is not open to the public.  History  From the 15th century to the beginning of the 19th century, the site was described in various ways: La Colle Narbonne, La Colle, La Colle Noire, La Colle dwelling etc. However, it was from 1826 that the domain finally took shape, when Henri-Emmanuel Poulle (1792‚Äì1877), lawyer, first president of the Court of Aix-en-Provence and deputy of the Var region, from an old family of Montauroux, became owner of the \\"domain of La Colle\\" and took the neighbouring hamlet's name to become the \\"domain de La Colle Noire\\". In 1839 Henri-Emmanuel Poulle created a staging post on the estate which later on would serve as the base for the future chateau. Over time, through various acquisitions, the estate reached an area of more than 90 hectares, becoming a vast agricultural operation, composed mainly of plowing fields, pastures, vines and muriers. In 1858, at the age of 66, Henri-Emmanuel Poulle decided to build a residence for his retirement. The construction lasted three years, from 1858 to 1861. The facade with its two emblematic towers that dominate the valley, dates from that time. It was also during this period that H-E. Poulle had a chapel dedicated to St Anne, in reference to his daughter Anne-Victoire. Henri-Emmanuel Poulle also had a chapel dedicated to Saint Barth√©l√©my in the village of Montauroux near the parish church. Due to the loss of its land title, it could not be sold as a national asset under the French Revolution and was thus protected from vandalism during the 1870 revolution. It passed into the heritage of H-E. Poulle and was transmitted to Christian Dior who offered it to the commune of Montauroux in 1953. The chapel was built in 1634 by the White Penitents, and still has today the wooden painted decor which adorns the walls as well as the vault. Upon the death of Henri-Emmanuel Poulle in 1877, the property passed on to his daughter, Anne-Victoire (1827‚Äì1894), married to F√©lix Reibaud, postmaster of the sector. Anne-Victoire was very pious and obtained permission from the Bishop of Frejus to allow the priest of Montauroux to say mass in the chapel St Anne every Sunday except for Christmas, Easter and other festivals. The inhabitants of the neighborhood became accustomed to hearing Mass at La Colle Noire. The St Anne chapel is still consecrated today. On the death of Anne-Victoire in 1894, his son Paul F√©lix Honor√© Reibaud inherited the estate of La Colle Noire. Head of office at the Ministry of Justice in Paris, he showed little interest in the property located in the remote Var region where his family originated. The property was ceded to an industrialist named Fayolle, whose widow resold the estate in 1921 to Pierre Grosselin. On October 25, 1950, the property, still with an area of more than 90 hectares, comprising a noble house, agricultural buildings and land cultivated mainly in vines and flowers, was bought by Christian Dior.  Christian Dior and La Colle Noire  Famous and recognized ‚Äì his house of couture was created in 1946 and his house of perfumes in 1947 ‚Äì Christian Dior acquired this emblematic property in a region that he knew well. Indeed, his father, a widow since 1931, lived close by in the plain of Callian with his young sister Catherine who was the inspiration for the perfume Miss Dior, \\"And then Miss Dior was born. She was born from those evenings of Provence crossed by fireflies where the green jasmine serves as a counter-song to the melody of the night and the earth\\".Christian Dior (1954) \\"Interview\\", Fashion Group. It was therefore in the Provence dear to his heart, in the inaccessible Var inland that Christian Dior would develop his house, far from Paris and 30 Avenue Montaigne, home of his couture house. \\"It is in Montauroux, near Callian, where a lucky star allowed me, fifteen years ago, to find tranquility and prepare a new existence. Of the house, I can not say much because I'm restoring it. It is simple, solid and noble, and its serenity suits the period of life that I will have to tackle in a few years. That house, I wish it to be my real home. That where ‚Äì if God lends me long life ‚Äì I can withdraw. That where ‚Äì if I have the means ‚Äì I can close the loop of my existence and find, under another climate, the closed garden that protected my childhood. That is where I can finally live quietly, forgetting Christian Dior to just become Christian again. It is at Montauroux that I write these last lines\\". Christian Dior entrusted the restoration and renovation of La Colle Noire from 1955 to the Russian architect Andre√Ø Svetchine.As he wrote himself, Christian Dior was passionate about architecture: \\"My weakness ‚Äì you've guessed ‚Äì is the vocation of an architect that has fascinated me since childhood. Though unable to pursue this, thwarted by family and events, I use couture as an indirect expression of this sovereign passion. A dress conceived by myself, is a form of ephemeral architecture‚Äù. Dior had already restored the Coudret mill at Milly-la-For√™t, bought in 1948. His friends Raymonde Zehnacker in Mougins and Marc Chagall in Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat and Saint-Paul-de-Vence had also solicited this architect, specialized in the transformation of \\"rural dwellings, neither simple farms nor real castles\\". He considered that the architectural balance was enough to decorate a house and thus the stonework was laid bare, the perspectives restored and enlarged, the accesses redesigned including the transformation of the service wing into a main entrance with an end resemblance of an 18th-century Bastide. Planted with cypress trees, a walkway leads to the hexagonal entrance hall, an atrium designed by Christian Dior himself, where the Proven√ßal calade floor has a pattern of compass rose dear to his childhood in Normandy. The south facade is asymmetrical and is in the 1940-50's Proven√ßal style. The chateau is reflected in the 45 meters long ornamental water mirror, also designed by Christian Dior, showing a contrast between the sinuosity of the landscape and the rigor of its straight lines. Completely redesigned, the new layout includes a large staircase with zenital lighting leading to guest rooms for ‚Äúpassing friends‚Äù, a succession of reception rooms, including the large salon measuring more than 18 metres long opening onto a terrace overlooking the mirror of water. It combines vintage furniture, comfort from the 1950s, references to Provence or England, \\"Christian Dior wanted to invent an art of living at the Colle Noire\\", Andre√Ø Svetchine declared. The reception rooms and Christian Dior's apartment are furnished with eclecticism, decorated with objects from the 18th and 19th centuries bought from antique dealers, some rooms have a Louis XV, Louis XVI or Retour d'Egypte style. The Provence inspired Christian Dior to create Miss Dior in 1947 and it was the Lily of the Valley of La Colle Noire that was at the origin of Diorissimo, created in 1956 by Edmond Roudnitska. It is this tradition and art that has inspired Fran√ßois Demachy the perfumer-creator of Parfums Christian Dior to create La Colle Noire, whom the May Rose flower is provided by the field planted as a tribute in the estate's park. After the death of Christian Dior on October 23, 1957, his sister Catherine inherited the estate although she was unable to maintain the chateau and it was resold to the Laroches, owners of La Reserve in Beaulieu and then to Mr. and Mrs. Tassou. The British group Oasis recorded in part its fourth album 'Standing on the shoulder of giants' from April to August 1999. In 2013 Parfums Christian Dior bought La Colle Noire. After an intense restoration begun in 2015, La Colle Noire was inaugurated by the Parfums Christian Dior on May 9, 2016 in the presence of Charlize Theron, regaining its vocation to welcome \\"the friends of the house\\". The Chateau de La Colle Noire illustrates this return to source, with the cultivation of flowers and the creation of perfumes in the ‚Äúgreat Grasse countryside‚Äù that has been the inspiration for the Christian Dior fragrances.

The university emerged from the dismemberment of the Lubango campus of the Agostinho Neto University in the midst of the reforms in Angolan higher education that occurred in the years 2008 and 2009. It has its area of operation restricted to the provinces of Hu√≠la and Namibia. History The historical tradition of UMN is intertwined with the creation of the \\"General University Studies of Angola\\" (initiated in Luanda in 1962). With the intention of expanding its scope, on August 5, 1963, the creation of a campus in Lubango (then S√° da Bandeira) was promulgated. However, campus classes would only begin on November 4 of this same year, with the beginning of classes in the Pedagogical Sciences course. In 1966, the Lubango campus became the \\"Delegation of General Studies of Angola in S√° da Bandeira\\", offering the university courses of preparation of teachers of the 8th and 11th groups of Higher Education. Later the courses of preparation were extinct to give place to free colleges. In 1968, the Delegation of S√° da Bandeira was linked to the \\"University of Luanda\\". In June 1974, High Commissioner Silva Cardoso and the then Minister of Education of the Transitional Government deployed the University of Luanda in three universities, with the local delegation becoming the University of Sa da Bandeira . He was appointed to head the new university as rector of the geography doctor Jos√© Guilherme Fernandes and as deputy rector engineer Ab√≠lio Fernandes, but this configuration lasted a short time, and from 1976 the \\"Lubango Delegation\\" is now linked to the new University of Angola (now Agostinho Neto University ), already in the midst of the independence of the country. In that same year he loses the Mathematics faculty, and the campus of Lubango is only with the Faculty of Letters. The Faculty of Letters was abolished in 1980 to give place to the Higher Institute of Education Science (ISCED) in Lubango, by decree n¬∫ 95 of August 30 of the Council of Ministers. In 2008/2009, according to the Government of Angola's program for higher education, in accordance with article 16 of Decree No. 7/09 of May 12, the University Mandume and Ndemufayo (UMN) is created as Public Education Institution Superior, from the elevation of the ISCED of Lubango. The UMN itself was able to undergo a new institution of higher education, when, by Decree-Law n. 188/14, of August 4, 2014, approved by the Council of Ministers, the University Cu√≠to Cuanavale was created, starting from the elevation of the old campus (and faculty) of this one in the locality of Cuito Cuanavale . The UMN is structured in organic units (Faculties, Institutes and Schools), these in turn organized in departments of education and research where several courses and specialties are given in several areas of scientific knowledge, at the undergraduate level.

Built about 1765, it is an important surviving example of colonial architecture in the community, and is one of its oldest buildings with a gambrel roof. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016. Description and history The Amos Baldwin House stands in a rural area of southern Norfolk, on the west side of Goshen Street East. It is a 1-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gambrel roof, central chimney, and clapboarded exterior. The front facade is five bays wide, with paired sash windows on either side of the main entrance, which is topped by a four-light transom window. There are three shed-roof dormered windows in the steep flank of the roof. A single-story gabled ell extends to the rear of the main block. The interior follows a typical central chimney plan, although the traditional winding stair in the front vestibule has been replaced by a closet. A number of early features survive on the interior, including Federal period fireplace paneling and the original kitchen fireplace. The house was built about 1765, and is one of the oldest surviving buildings in Norfolk, which was first settled in the mid-18th century. It was probably built by Captain John Watson, who owned the land between 1763 and 1774. Amos Baldwin, probably its best-known owner, was a farmer and local politician in the first half of the 19th century. In 1928 it was purchased by Richard Leach, who briefly operated the private Norfolk School here; opened in 1937, it operated on this site from 1940 until it closed in 1943. The school, modeled on the nearby Kent School, was a college preparatory boarding school serving boys in grades eight through twelve. The rear ell of the house was adapted by the school as a dormitory space.

Founded in 2003 by Patrick Lessard, its name comes from an elven language created by author J. R. R. Tolkien: cali meaning light and macil meaning sword. This company specializes in the creation, manufacturing and distribution of foam weapons used in LARP, historical reenactment, movies and TV series. Calimacil collaborates with many organizations and partners to develop weapons based on Heroic Fantasy themes, such as the ones from Amos Daragon, from Bryan Perro, which were created for summer camp Le Sanctuaire des Braves. The same applies to the fantasy novels Knights of Emerald, written by Anne Robillard, and the Seyrawyn book series, written by Martial Gris√©. In 2015, Calimacil used the crowdfunding site Kickstarter to begin its project of a Foam LED Saber. Successfully funded on December 3, 2015, this campaign makes it possible for Calimacil to reach a wider audience, and to integrate electronics into its foam weapons. Design and production of the weapons is made in their Sherbrooke workshop. Their products go through a molding process using historical of fantasy weapons as inspiration. The production process starts by the injection of a special foam around a rigid polymer or carbon core. Calimacil has some points of sale throughout the world and distributes its products in more than 12 countries. Calimacil has four business segments: Live action role-playing gear, the entertainment industry, replica gear, and the new electronic product, CaliMotion, which is mainly used in the LEDSaber, Calimacil version of the lightsaber. In 2017, Calimacil tripled its workshop size to meet global demand for its products. This expansion project is valued at $1 million.

POC21 innovation camp was a cooperation between the German collective Open State and the French network OuiShare.  Principles  POC21 innovation camp brought together the startup world, DIY scene and environmentalist ideas to show solutions to fight climate change. The main principles of POC21 innovation camp derive from Sustainable Design, Open Source and Zero Waste.  Structure  POC21 innovation camp focused on the development of technology and on creative processes. The creative processes involved a.o. workshops, keynotes, mentoring (with a.o. Bruce Sterling and Michel Bauwens from P2P Foundation), reality checks with external business and science experts and regular retrospectives. The twelve project teams could use the knowledge and experience from 200 trainers, marketing experts, product designers and engineers to further develop their prototype in five weeks. The camp was a temporary commune. In the five weeks of the camp a living prototype of a sustainable society was established and concepts like Coworking, Coliving, non-hierarchical structures and consensus principles were used and put into practice. The infrastructure of Chateau de Millemont was basic with a community kitchen, compost toilets and a tent camp. The FabLab provided high tech tools, 3D printer, laser cutter and CNC machines. The camp itself was a prototype for a local micro factory. 40% of the financial budget of 1M ‚Ç¨ was donated by both business companies and foundations, 20% originated from public subsidies.  12 projects  * $30 Wind Turbine: low-cost and easy-to-build recycling solution for individual energy harvesting * Aker: Kits for urban gardening * Kitchen B: modular kitchen reducing energy and waste * Bicitractor: pedal driven tractor as a fuel less alternative for big industrial machines * Faircap: reusable water filter for bottles * Nautile: energy saving kettle * Open Energy Monitor: tool for visualizing domestic energy consumption * Myfood: permaculture and aquaponics greenhouse * SolarOSE: solar concentrator to provide thermal energy * Showerloop: real-time shower looping system minimizing water and energy usage * Sunzilla: modular and portable solar-powered generators to power remote areas * Velo M2: multi-functional cargo bike capsules All twelve projects are open source and can be built, modified and distributed.

The Royal Navy sold her in 1817. She made one voyage between 1817 and 1820 as a whaler. She then sailed between Plymouth and North America until October 1827 when her crew had to abandon her at sea because she was waterlogged. Royal Navy career Wanderer was commissioned in December 1806 under Commander Edward Crofton. She was designated for the North Sea Station in 1807. Wanderer, , and were to join Admiral Thomas McNamara Russell in capturing the island of Heligoland. All three arrived on 6 September, the day of the formal acceptance by both sides of the articles of capitulation. Then on 24 October Wanderer recaptured Nancy. On 3 July 1808, Wanderer was cruising with the schooners and , between the islands of Anguilla and Saint Martin. The small squadron attempted an attack on St. Martin with a view to reducing the number of havens available to French privateers, but unfortunately the opposition proved stronger than intelligence had suggested. The attack was a debacle. A landing party of 38 seamen and marines from all three vessels, under Lieutenant George A. Spearing, captain of Subtle, succeeded in capturing a lower battery with few losses and spiking six guns. An attack on the upper fort failed, with Spearing being killed a few feet from the French ramparts. When the British withdrew to their boats the French captured them. In all, the British lost seven killed and 30 wounded, all the dead and most of the wounded being from Subtle. The French lost one man wounded. Not surprisingly, French and British accounts differ substantially in several places. Crofton's account reports that the British landing party consisted of 153 men, and a French account talks of 200 men, all of whom were killed or captured, including Lieutenant George Mills, captain of Ballahoo. (The total establishment of the three British vessels amounted to about 190 men.) Crofton negotiated a truce under which he was able to reclaim all the prisoners who could be moved. Crofton claimed that the French had been forewarned and had 900 men in the fort.Gentleman's magazine, Vol. 78, Part. 2, pp. 851-2. The French claimed the fort had a garrison of 28 regulars and 15 militia men.Bulletin of the Soci√©t√© bretonne de g√©ographie. (Lorient: La Soci√©t√©, [1882- ], Issues 10-21, p. 118. That the French permitted their British prisoners to leave is more consistent with the French figures on their numbers than the British. Crofton reported that the French buried the English dead with full military honors with both the fort and the British firing salutes. On 5 October 1809 Wanderer was in company with and and all three shared in proceeds of the capture of George. Prize money was forwarded in 1815 from the Vice admiralty court in Antigua. In 1810 Wanderer was under the command of Commander William Robillard, in the Caribbean. Wanderer also participated in the capture of Guadeloupe in January and February 1810. In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the Naval General Service Medal with clasp \\"Guadaloupe\\" to all surviving participants of the campaign. In 1811 the Navy reclassed her as sixth-rate post-ship. Captain Francis Newcombe took command in April 1811. Wanderer sailed with the Lisbon convoy on 17 June 1812, and then sailed for North America on 28 August. In December she captured the American brig Rising Hope, which had been sailing from Charleston to Cadiz. On 19 January 1813 Wanderer captured Three Friends. On 14 March 1814 Wanderer was in company with and so shared the prize and head money for the capture of the American letter of marque Adeline. (The Americans later recaptured Adeline.)

Akilu was former Director of Behavioral Analysis and Strategic Communication at the Office of the National Security Advisor in Nigeria, where she worked on the country's Countering Violent Extremism Programme between 2012 and 2015. The CVE programme is part of the government's long-term strategy to tackle Boko Haram; the terror group responsible for the deaths of over 20,000 people across Nigeria. Described as a sophisticated and research-based attempt to understand and address the causes and effects of the insurgency, Nigeria's CVE Programme is a multi-disciplinary intervention targeting ex Boko Haram members, youth, and other vulnerable groups through social programmes that provide them with positive alternatives to violent extremism. These programmes focused on the nexus between development and security at the community level. Akilu has worked with liberated wives of Boko Haram commanders, who pose a unique challenge since they often experienced respected and privileged positions within the insurgency society and often long to return. Akilu is currently the Executive Director of Neem Foundation, a Non-Governmental Organisation founded as a direct response to the problem of insecurity in Nigeria.

It protects a mountainous area with cerrado and caatinga vegetation that is an important source of water in a dry region. Location The Caminho dos Gerais State Park is divided between the municipalities of Espinosa: , Gameleiras: , Mamonas: and Monte Azul: in the north of Minas Gerais. It has an area of . The park protects part of the Serra Geral, and is an extension of the Espinha√ßo Mountains. It covers rugged terrain with an average altitude of . Soils are mainly latosols, cambisols and quartzarenic neosols, with rocky outcrops. It rises dramatically from a landscape of vast plains. Its ridges, gorges, rapids, waterfalls and beautiful views give it significant tourist potential. History Creation of the park was based on local demand, the quality of the environment, the scenic beauty and the potential for tourism. The local civil organizations, municipal authorities and elected officials asked the IEF to protect the area, which is the only source of water now that burning the cerrado for charcoal and planting eucalyptus had dried up the other sources. The Caminho dos Gerais State Park was created by governor A√©cio Neves by state decree on 28 March 2007 with the purpose of protecting regional fauna, flora, and the sources of rivers and streams of the region, and of supporting and reconciling scientific, educational and recreational use with preservation of the natural heritage. Environment The environment in the region has been adversely affected by expansion of agriculture, livestock and eucalyptus plantations without concern about their impact, particularly in the areas of chapadas. As a result, some flora and fauna are threatened with extinction, and some water courses have disappeared. The park is in an area that is still in good condition and contains rare, endemic and endangered species. The area has not been well studied by scientists. The climate is dry, with average annual rainfall between in Espinosa and in Gameleiras. There is a well-defined rainy period. Average annual temperature is about . The park is the main source of water for the four municipalities, and also protects the sources of the Verde Pequeno River, a tributary of the Rio Verde Grande, which in turn is a tributary of the S√£o Francisco River. It holds the sources of streams and rivers such as the Gameleiras, Engenho, Boa Vista, Brejo, Coronel, Jac√∫ das Piranhas, Po√ßo Triste, Boqueir√£o do Encantado, P√© de Serra, Riacho Seco, Espera and Capivara. Vegetation includes cerrado and caatinga dry forest. The parks holds rare species such as Ip√™ (Tabebuia sp.), Jatob√° (Hymenaea courbaril), Pequi (Caryocar brasiliense), Pacari (Lafoensia pacari), Pau santo (Kielmeyera sp.), Faveiro (Dimorphandra mollis) and Angico (Anadenanthera colubrina).

Shimmin. It was first performed in 1912 by the Peel Players and it is considered to be one of the earliest and most frequently performed pieces in the Manx dialect repertoire. Background From 1908 Sophia Morrison had been producing Manx dialect theatre at Manx Language Society entertainments in Peel.'Peel Entertainment', Peel City Guardian 25 April 1908 These had been written by Cushag and John Quine initially, but in 1912 Sophia Morrison commissioned Christopher Shimmin to write the plays.'Shiaght Laa' interview broadcast on Manx Radio, 04 January 2017 Morrison plotted out the action of The Charm and Shimmin wrote it, before it was rehearsed in her home on Athol Street, Peel. When it was produced in November 1912, it was a new venture for the Manx Language Society, in that it was their first event consisting solely of plays, without other items on the stage. Plot Jem and Kirrie Quilliam are unhappily married due to his unreasonable expectations of her. Kirrie mentions this to Pyee, a travelling beggar woman and dealer in charms, who suggests that she might be able to offer a solution. Kirrie follows her direction and puts a herb into Jem's tea, which brings them both to fall into a deep sleep. When they awake their roles are reversed, with Kirree asking unreasonable levels of work from Jem. Pyee returns and this time Jem asks for a herb to remedy the situation, which she provides. After another sleep, the couple awake happily in love again. The play closes with Kirree on Jem's knee. Early performances Sophia Morrison, producer of the first production of The Charm The play was first performed in the Centenary Hall in Peel on 7 November 1912, alongside Illiam Kodhere's Will, also by Christopher Shimmin.'Successful Production of Two New Manx Plays', Peel City Guardian 9 November 1912 The event was organised by Sophia Morrison in aid of the Manx Language Society. The hall was 'packed' and the plays receiving an 'enthusiastic reception,' with The Charm being said to have 'caused great laughter, from start to finish.' In the curtain call that followed the performance, Shimmin took to the stage and delivered a short speech. In this he emphasised the specifically Manx element of the production, which was important to the building of Manx identity underway at that time: > Mr. Shimmin thanked the audience for their kind reception. He was a Manxman, > and that was one of the few things he had to be proud of. There was one > point he was very pleased of ‚Äì the promoters, the players, Miss Morrison, > and himself, were all Manx.

Ogun East covers eleven local government areas: Ijebu North East, Ijebu North, Ijebu-Ode, Ijebu East, Ikenne, Odogbolu, Remo North, Sagamu, and Ogun Waterside. Senator Kashamu was the Vice-Chairman of the Senate Committee on States and Local Government. He was a chieftain of the People's Democratic Party, PDP in Ogun State. He was appointed as the chairman, Organization and Mobilization Committee of the PDP in the South West zone of Nigeria. In 2018, he was expelled from the People's Democratic Party, a decision later voided by an Abuja High Court in October 2018. He was the 2019 Ogun State gubernatorial election candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party. He died of COVID-19 on 8 August 2020. Early life and education Kashamu was born in Ogun State, Nigeria on 19 May 1958. Kashamu started his education at Ansarudeen Primary School, Ijebu Igbo and left in 1972 to complete his primary school education at St. John Modern School, Lagos. He then attended evening classes at Igbobi College while working as a licensing agent. He later went to London where he took courses in Business Management at Pitman College, London. He was awarded an honorary PhD by the unaccredited, diploma-mill Cambridge Graduate University, located in Massachusetts, at a privately organised ceremony in Lagos, Nigeria. Cambridge Graduate University claims to be accredited by the International Accreditation Organization (IAO). The IAO itself is listed as part of unrecognized higher education accreditation organizations. Cambridge Graduate University is not a recognised university in the United States due to this lack of accreditation. Politics He contested the Ogun east senatorial seat and beat his closest rival with a poll of 99,540 votes against Prince Dapo Abiodun of the All Progressive Congress (APC) who polled 84,001 votes to clinch the senatorial seat. He was the flag bearer of the Peoples Democratic Party in the 2019 Ogun State gubernatorial election and lost against Dapo Abiodun of the All Progressives Congress coming in a distant 4th.  Controversy  In 1998, Kashamu was arrested in the United Kingdom on drugs- related charges after trying to enter the country with $230,000 in cash. He was acquitted and released in 2003. British authorities refused a US extradition request on drugs charges, citing concerns about his identity, however Nigerian authorities announced their intention to deport him to the US on multiple occasions. Olusegun Obasanjo, a former president, warned that his ongoing freedom illustrated that \\"drug barons ... will buy candidates, parties and eventually buy power or be in power themselves\\". It is claimed that Kashamu is the real identity of \\"Alhaji\\", the drug kingpin in Piper Kerman's book, Orange Is the New Black: My Year in a Women's Prison.

She was a co-founder of the Jena branch of the Communist Party. In 1932 she emigrated with her husband to the Soviet Union. Her husband was arrested in 1941: the circumstances of his death remain unknown. Gertrud was refused permission to leave the Soviet Union till 1954, when she returned to what had by this time become the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) where she found she had acquired a certain official celebrity, honoured as a \\"[Communist] party veteran\\". Life Family provenance and early years Gertrud M√ºller was born in Gera, in the Principality of Reuss-Gera. Her father was a weaver. She trained for work in garment manufacturing and, in 1907, married the trades official (1884-1943). Their daughter, Hildegard (1907-1980) was born later in the same year, after which the family relocated to Jena, where Edwin Morgner found work as a lathe operator with Carl Zeiss AG. Edwin Morgner had been a member of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) since 1902 and in 1908 a significant prohibition on female participation in politics was lifted. Gertrud Morgner joined the SPD in 1909 and began to work for the party in Jena on an honorary (i.e. unpaid) basis. Between 1909 and 1913 she was a member of the local party executive and head of its women's committee for Jena. In 1916 she joined the Spartacus League, an anti-war group headed by Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg (and others less well remembered) which had originated as a faction within the SPD. By this time she had become active as a distributor of pamphlets and organiser of women's demonstration opposing the war, as a result of which she was excluded from the SPD, though it is not clear from available sources whether this happened before or after she joined the Spartacus League. The next year the SPD itself broke apart, primarily because of acute opposition among party activists to what amounted to a parliamentary truce operated by the party leadership in the Reichstag for the duration of the war. Morgner was among many former SPD members who joined the breakaway faction, which now became identified as the Independent Social Democratic Party (\\"Unabh√§ngige Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands\\" / USPD). Middle years: political activism Germany's military defeat was followed by a series of revolutionary outbursts across the country. In an ad hoc election held in the city's market place Gertrud Morgner was elected deputy chair of the Soldiers' and Workers' Council in Jena. Edwin and Gertrud Morgner both took part in the three day founding party conference of the Communist Party of Germany which opened in Berlin on 30 December 1918. Edwin Morgner was at this time a member of the works council at Carl Zeiss, and on 11 January 1919, at a meeting conducted in the \\"Zum L√∂wen\\" trades union building, the Morgners, with 39 other comrades, founded a Jena branch of the new Communist Party. Gertrud Morgner was elected to the executive of Jena's local Communist Party and for a time she also served as a member of the party leadership team for Thuringia (\\"KPD-Bezirksleitung Th√ºringen\\"). She took part in the \\"March Action\\", identified as a member of the \\"revolutionary committee\\", during the first part of 1921 and therefore became a \\"wanted person\\" in central Germany. In order to avoid possible punishment she relocated to Berlin where she lived illegally (i.e. without taking action to register her presence/residence with the city authorities). Keen to reduce the risk of further violence, in 1922 the government issued a widespread amnesty to those involved in the previous year's insurrectionary activity, and in 1922 Morgner felt able to \\"resurface\\", active between 1922 and 1926 in the Communist Party's national women's leadership (\\"Reichsfrauenleitung\\") and working in the party central committee's propaganda department. Between 1927 and 1929 she was employed as secretary to . H√∂llein was a Communist member of the national parliament (Reichstag). Morgner was not merely his secretary during this time but also his mistress. However, on 18 August 1929 Emil H√∂llein unexpectedly died. After this, during a period of intensifying social and political tensions in Germany, Morgner led a Communist Party operational cell (\\"KPD-Betriebszelle\\"). Emigration to the Soviet Union In March 1932 Emil and Gertrud Morgner emigrated to the Soviet Union where Gertrud worked heading up the women's activist section of the foreigners' department and clubs. She also became a member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. In June 1941 she was appointed to an editorial position with Moscow Radio. However, her husband's time in Moscow was working out less well and in September 1941 he was arrested by the security services. Gertrud Morgner was now excluded from the Communist Party. She was later evacuated/exiled to Kazakhstan. Here she worked in garment making in Ossakarowka. It was only in 1949 that she was informed that her husband had already died in prison by 31 January 1943. Return to East Germany After war ended in May 1945 a large area round Berlin was administered as the Soviet occupation zone, relaunched in October 1949 as the Soviet sponsored German Democratic Republic (East Germany), a one-party state with institutions closely modeled on those of the Soviet Union itself. However, the ruling party was known not as the Communist Party but as the Socialist Unity Party (\\"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands\\" / SED). Far from Berlin or Moscow, Gertrud Morgner was still being told, as late as June 1953, that her application to return to East Germany had been rejected because the Central Party Control Commission (\\"Zentrale Parteikontrollkommission\\") of the SED back in East Germany had her listed as an \\"expelled member of the Communist Party\\".\\"... es handele sich bei Gertrud Morgner um ein ausgeschlossenes Mitglied der KPD ...\\" In May 1954 Gertrud Morgner was permitted to travel to East Germany, where she became an SED party member. She became active in the Democratic Women's League (\\"Demokratischer Frauenbund Deutschlands\\" / DFD), the National Front and the (East German) Peace Council. In East Germany she found herself honoured as a party veteran, but at the same time her fate and that of her husband in the Soviet Union were not to be subjects for public discussion. Privately she let her friends know of the way in which her soul had been deeply and irrecoverably shattered by the arrest and subsequent death of her husband. Death and burial Gertrud Morgner lived the final part of her life in the party central committee's retirement home in Berlin-K√∂penick. She died on 20 July 1978. Her body was buried in the \\"Pergolenweg\\" section of the Friedrichsfelde Main cemetery. This cemetery was the one reserved for the bodies of East German political leaders and national heroes.

It was founded in 1959 by wine pioneer and former dancer, Rodney Strong, the winery focuses solely on Sonoma County grape growing and wines. Rodney Strong Vineyards sources from throughout Sonoma County and has 14 estate vineyards located in Alexander Valley, Russian River Valley, Chalk Hill, Sonoma Coast and Dry Creek Valley. It was recognized as American Winery of the Year in 2013 by Wine Enthusiast Magazine.  About  Grapes from the vineyard Rodney Strong Vineyards was founded in 1959 by Rodney Strong, an American dancer and a pioneer in the wine industry. It was later purchased by the Klein family, a fourth generation California farming family, in 1989. In 1991, Tom Klein became president of Klein Family Vintners and Rodney Strong Vineyards. Tom Klein proceeded to invest in winemaking innovation and production growth. Rick Sayre, Vice President of Winemaking, joined Rodney Strong Vineyards in 1979. The winery farms 14 estate vineyards and sources grapes from vineyards throughout Sonoma County, focusing on Russian River Valley, Alexander Valley, Chalk Hill and Sonoma Coast. Rodney Strong Vineyards wines are estate-bottled, Sonoma County wines, including single varietal and single vineyard offerings. They are recognized for their sustainability efforts including fish friendly farming, solar energy production and being carbon neutral.  History  Founder Rodney Strong as a dancer Sr. Vice President of Winemaking Rick Sayre Rodney Strong was a professional dancer turned Sonoma County vintner. He was one of the first to plant extensive vineyards in prime Sonoma locations including Chalk Hill, Russian River Valley and Alexander Valley. In 1959, Rodney Strong and his wife Charlotte Ann Winson, moved to Northern California where they purchased a century-old boarding house and began making their first wines. It was the thirteenth bonded winery in Sonoma County. In 1962, Rodney Strong purchased a turn-of-the-century winery and vineyard in Windsor, Sonoma County with 159 acres of ‚Äúmixed‚Äù grapes. In 1965 he replanted his vineyard to Chardonnay vines - the first Chardonnay planted in what would later become the Chalk Hill AVA. In 1968, Rodney Strong was the first to plant Pinot Noir in Russian River Valley. In those days, Sonoma County was known for dairies and fruit orchards with few vineyards. Using the latest climate data from UC Davis, he purchased his River East Vineyard and planted Pinot Noir. In 1974, Rodney Strong released the first Alexander Valley single vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon. He was one of the first to recognize the potential of Alexander Valley. The wine came from his Alexander‚Äôs Crown vineyard located near Jimtown. Alexander Valley became an AVA 10 years later. In 1977, Rodney Strong released the first ‚ÄúChalk Hill‚Äù labeled Chardonnay, introducing the world to Chardonnay from Chalk Hill. Chalk Hill became an AVA five years later. In 1979, Rick Sayre joined the Rodney Strong winemaking team, growing it into the award-winning program is it today. In 1989, The Klein Family purchased Rodney Strong Vineyards. Over the next decade, the Klein family funded the purchase of fermentation tanks, state-of-the-art Bucher presses, a steady infusion of new oak barrels, an on- site case goods warehouse, custom barrel servicing equipment, a new crush pad and scale house, a conveyance system to perform whole-cluster pressing on white grapes, and a 100,000 square-foot, temperature-controlled barrel storage building. In January 2020, Rodney Strong Vineyards made headlines when it was reported that thousands of gallons of cabernet sauvignon spilled into California's Russian River. The spill was estimated to be one of the largest in the county's history.  Sustainability  Rodney Strong Vineyards sustainably farms their 14 estate vineyards. They are certified sustainable by the California Sustainable Winegrowing Alliance and were the first carbon neutral winery in Sonoma County. Front entrance of the winery Their sustainable practices include solar panels which were installed in 2003 on the roof of the barrel room. At the time this was the largest winery solar array in the world. They use soil management techniques to conserve the land including: proper runoff management, erosion prevention, reducing soil compaction, composting grape pumice to return to the soils as organic matter, minimal tillage and the intelligent use of cover crops. Vineyard water management is extremely important and includes using drip irrigation to reduce water use, along with tools, technologies and strategies to monitor water in soils and vines. Rodney Strong Vineyards are Fish Friendly Farming (FFF) certified to restore fish and wildlife habitats and improve water quality. They protect air quality by using natural cover crops, completely eliminating the burning of winter prunings and the use of environmentally safe wetting agents for vineyard roads.  Collaborations  In December 2016, Rodney Strong Vineyards announced in partnership with Wine Business Institute at Sonoma State University the Rodney Strong Pathways Program, designed to bring a broad range of students to Sonoma State University and provide them with a better educational experience and support to guarantee academic and life success. The winery is a sponsor of the Luther Burbank Center for the Arts supporting performances and education programs for children and adults throughout Sonoma County. They are also sponsor of Children of Restaurant Employees (CORE). CORE supports the children of food and beverage employees with life-altering conditions and circumstances.

Some sporadic smaller protests also took place across India as well as overseas. The chief motivation of the protest was against the Supreme Court's order to ban jallikattu (occasionally also known as sallikattu, eru taluval and manju virattu), a traditional Tamil bull taming sport, which is held during Pongal, a harvest festival in the state of Tamil Nadu, India. The sport is conducted annually on the second day of the Tamil month Thai. The sport was banned by the Supreme Court in a decision citing cruelty to animals based on a lawsuit filed by the animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), which asserted that it violates the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act (PCA). The first large protests occurred on 8 January 2017, when several groups, organised largely via social media, conducted a protest at the Marina beach in Chennai to revoke the ban on jallikattu which was imposed in 2014. These groups also demanded that PETA be banned from India. The protests soon gained momentum and spread all over Tamil Nadu. After several days of protests, jallikattu was finally legalised locally on 23 January when the Government of Tamil Nadu passed a bill to amend the PCA Act. As the legalisation is not Indian federal law, but rather state law, there is concern from Indian legal experts that jallikattu could be banned once again by the Supreme Court. The largely peaceful nature of the protests received praise from all over the country and inspired the legalisation movements of several other Indian states' traditional outlawed celebrations. Despite violence on 23 January, this perception continued after the Tamil Nadu Police reported that the violence was caused by \\"anti-social elements\\" co-opting the protest, and not the student protesters themselves. The movement has been described as a symbol for Tamil pride and has largely been compared to the anti-Hindi agitations of Tamil Nadu and dubbed by many as 'Thai Puratchi'.  Timeline  Thousands of people protesting on Marina Beach in Chennai Women protesting at Vivekananda House in Chennai Students use their mobile phone flashlights to illuminate their protest after street lights are turned off by power company TNEB. Protesters in Jantar Mantar, New Delhi Sporadic demonstrations began on 4 January, but mass protests did not begin until two weeks later. On 16 January 2017, villagers of Alanganallur protested at Alanganallur 'Vaadi vaasal'-The Arena, the place known for the jallikattu sport ‚Äì on that date, the sport was also practiced in defiance of the ban. After a day long protest, police arrested the protesters numbering around 200 in Madurai. On 17 January 2017, In support of the arrested, Students gathered in Marina Beach. This day incidentally coincided with the birth centenary of former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.G.Ramachadran. The crowds started swelling for the night and few hundred spent their night in beach and the crowds continued to gather strength throughout the next day. The protest erupted around the state including Salem, Erode, Coimbatore, Nagercoil, Thiruchrapalli, Pudhuchery. On 19 January, many volunteer groups and individuals once again gathered at the Marina beach for overnight protests. deputy Tamil Nadu Chief Minister O.Paneerselvam met Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and pushed for an ordinance. With no sign of protests relenting the centre suggested ordinance by Tamil Nadu Government. On 20 January, The draft ordinance was approved by Home, Environmental and Cultural Ministry. On 20 January, the chief minister of Tamil Nadu announced that a law has been drafted and sent to the Central Government, stating, \\"There are full chances that jallikattu will be organised within 1‚Äì2 days.\\" The Hindustan Times reported that the Centre approved the bill without recommending any changes, and that all that remains now is for it to be signed by the President of India, Pranab Mukherjee. On this day the Marina beach Witnessed around 20 lakh protesters on peaceful Occupy Marina protest alone with lacs thronging various cities of state.. The day witnessed a virtual shutdown in the state as most organization downed their shutters expressing solidarity for the cause. The Opposition party Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) staged Rail Roko in district headquarters of the state. On 21 January, the protests still continue demanding a permanent solution. Some politicians of the opposition parties started fasting as a sign of protest. The State Government promulgated the ordinance and announced that it would conduct the event the next day. However the protesters refused to budge, as they believe the ordinance has very weak legal grounds and could be overturned in much the same way as the Supreme Court overturned the 2009 ordinance. On 22 January, the government tried to conduct the sport despite the opposition from the local people in Alanganallur and other parts of Tamil Nadu who demanded a permanent resolution which can ensure jallikattu for generations to come. The protesters had successfully blocked the sport from being conducted as Government festival. However a jallikattu event was organised and held at Pudukottai without proper safety measures on a very short notice and was inaugurated by the government minister, which eventually killed two people and many were left injured. On 23 January, with protesters refusing to budge, police began early morning forceful evictions, moving people by hand and also employing batons. Protesters at the marina threatened to venture into the sea, but eventually most protesters were removed and access to the protest site was cut off. The evictions led to further protesters and threaten to boycott the upcoming Republic Day celebrations in Chennai beach.. The entire city came to standstill with protesters blocking major roads and incidents of stone pelting torching of vehicles, police stations and petrol bombs were thrown whose identity remain unknown. There have also been reports of police involving in burning of autos and vehicles. The videos of cop setting fire on vehicles and involving in arson have been going viral in social media. The initial organizers of protests called for calm and few including actors condemned the violence and the subsequent crackdown. At the end of day most of protests were either withdrawn evacuated or forcefully at all places including at Marina Beach, Madurai, Salem, Erode and Coimbatore and normalcy started to be restored. On 24 January, according to the Times of India, the majority of student protestors in Chennai decided to call off their protest after a dialogue with police and a district court judge, viewing the Tamil Nadu ordinance and planned law as a victory, but promised to restart it if there was no permanent solution for jallikattu by 1 February. The legal situation surrounding jallikattu is as yet not clearly resolved. While the Tamil Nadu government has claimed that its draft ordinance is a \\"permanent solution\\", many jallikattu supporters view it as merely being a \\"stop gap measure\\". As ordinances only last for six months, the Tamil Nadu Assembly plans to make the ordinance into state law \\"immediately\\". Some, however such as Ministry of External Affairs cabinet minister Salman Khurshid, have stated that the matter will only be truly resolved if the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act is amended as local ordinances and state laws cannot trump Indian federal law. According to The Hindu, many other Indian legal experts agreed with Khurshid's view, as federal laws such as the PCA are always more powerful than state laws, and in that respect the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Tamil Nadu Amendment) Act of 2017 is not much different from the 2009 one. On 24 January, in light of the new Tamil Nadu legislation, the Centre withdrew its notification allowing the sport; this means that any new legal challenges will be directed against the new legislation. For its part, PETA India has said that it will \\"study\\" the new ordinance, and has not ruled out a challenge to the new law on the same grounds as it challenged the 2009 law. On 25 January, the Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI) restarted the legal process by formally challenging the new law before the Supreme Court, but it withdrew the petition the next day. According to the AWBI's acting chairperson, AWBI does not plan to re-file the petition, but he claimed no knowledge of what other organizations, such as PETA, may do. On 6 July 2017, PETA India released a YouTube video showing the results of their investigation of five Jallikattu events which took place across Tamil Nadu in February 2017. According to PETA, their investigation showed abuse of the animals during the February events, including the tails of bulls being bitten and twisted, collapsed bulls being pulled by ropes attached to their noses, and bulls having their tailbones purposefully broken. In an interview with The Hindu, organisers of the events denied the claims of PETA. On 7 July 2017, PETA filed a petition with the Supreme Court of India seeking a renewed ban on Jallikattu via the invalidation of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Tamil Nadu Amendment) Act of 2017 as unconstitutional. On 2 February 2018, the Supreme Court of India accepted PETA's petition, referring the case to its constitution bench.  Demands from the protesters   Major demands  * To declare an ordinance to ensure the removal of 'bulls' from the 'list of performing animals' as per the Prevention of Cruelty to Animal (PCA) Act (1960). * To seek permanent solution for jallikattu, by passing a permanent act to conduct jallikattu every year. * To ban People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) in India.  Other demands  * Boycott of foreign companies such as Pepsi, Coca-Cola as their water consumption is affecting local farmers  Background  Jallikattu is a traditional bull taming event wherein a berserk bull is released into a crowd, and the participants of the crowd individually attempt to grab and hold on to the bull's hump for a determined distance, a determined time, or with the goal of removing a packet of money tied to the bull's horns. The sport, which is considered to be 2500‚Äì10,000 years old, is usually held during Thai Pongal across several locations in Tamil Nadu, with the primary event being held in Alanganallur. During the event, injuries or even death often occur to participants. While bull breeders contend that the participating bulls are treated well, PETA asserts its investigators found that the bulls suffers cruel treatment, from having their tails twisted, being stabbed, punched and jumped on. India's Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act (PCAA) outlaws animal cruelty, and sets up the punishment offenders can expect to receive. The Madras High Court was the first to rule that jallikattu was not allowable under the PCAA in 2006. However, traditional sports like jallikattu have since then always been allowed through various legal and extralegal means, the most recent of which is the Tamil Nadu Regulation of Jallikattu Act No 27, passed by the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly and signed into law in 2009. In January 2011, Hema Malini appealed to the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoE) to ban Jallikatu, and it responded by issuing a notification that bulls may no longer be used as performing animals in India, adding it to a list which previously included only bears, monkeys, tigers, panthers and lions. Armed with this, in April 2011, PETA announced that it would challenge the 2009 Tamil Nadu law as unconstitutional, as it now conflicts with the Indian federal law. After three years in court, on 7 May 2014, PETA, represented by Raj Panjwani, along with the Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI), striking down the 2009 Tamil Nadu law. In defiance of the ban, citizens of Tamil Nadu attempted to carry out the tradition on 18 January 2015, but police arrested forty six people and allowed the animals to go free. In preparation for the 2016 jallikattu season, the Centre reversed its earlier decision and on 7 January 2016 MoE once again removed bulls from the list of banned performing animals. Justices Dipak Misra and Rohinton Fali Nariman were highly critical of this reaction, and were quoted by The Hindu as stating jointly: \\"How can you negate our judgment banning jallikattu by coming up with the January 2016 notification allowing bulls to participate in the sport again? [...] We cannot import Roman gladiator-type sport here.\\" The Supreme Court issued a stay order on 12 January 2016, effectively banning the sport just five days after the Centre unbanned it. With the police on their side this time, however, jallikattu went ahead anyway, and thousands gathered to watch bull races and the main sport. In preparation for the 2017 season, once again multiple petitions were filed to try to get the Supreme Court to reconsider; and once again they were all denied, including a petition attempting to argue a religious freedom angle. The Supreme Court once again sparred with the Centre, who was trying to get it unbanned as it was a 5,000-year-old cultural tradition of the Tamil people, but the court responded simply \\"In 1899, ten thousand girls below 12 years of age were married. Should we allow it today because it was a tradition at that time?\\" and rejected the petition. For the 2017 season, political tension was high, perhaps sparking the massive protest: people blamed the AIADMK and BJP political parties for failing to reverse the ban during the last three years. Once again, citizens flouted the Supreme Court, and jallikattu went ahead despite its legal status. With an uncooperative judiciary, the other branches of government began work on a law which would override the court's decision: on 19 January 2017, prime minister of India Narendra Modi vowed to support Tamil Nadu but declined to give further details, claiming that he could not as the case was currently sub judice. In an interview, former Supreme Court justice Markandey Katju observed that laws can be changed even when the matter is in court as was done for the act that abolished zamindari in the 1950s when the Nehru government removed the right to property as a fundamental right.  Support  Jallikattu is cited as one of the last available ways to promote and preserve the native livestock because the other uses of native breeds such as ploughing, breeding via mating and milk is on decline due to advancement in mechanization by tractors, improvement in artificial insemination and hybrid Jersey cows respectively. Karthikeyan Siva Senaapathy, a native breed activist, has said in an interview with the BBC that \\"[Tamil Nadu] had over one million Kangayam bulls in 1990. The population has fallen to 15,000 now.\\" Minor protests were initiated by cattle rights activists and farmers such as Karthikeya Sivasenapathy who has appeared multiple times on the STAR Vijay talk show Neeya Naana. Music videos, such as \\"Takkaru Takkaru\\" by Hiphop Tamizha, and on Facebook videos to talk about jallikattu and its benefits inspired the protestors. Sivasenapathy has claimed that the indigenous cattle bulls are critically endangered in Tamil Nadu and banning jallikattu will have the adverse effect of wiping them out completely. According to Sivasenapthy and other pro-jallikattu activists, jallikattu is not just a sport that is deeply entrenched in Tamil culture, but it has also inadvertently served as a scientific method of breeding cattle. This view is held among a majority of jallikattu supporters. The protest is aimed at revival of the native humped bull, called the zebu. The Tamil Nadu breed of zebu is unique to India and has several advantages compared to European varieties of cattle such as the Holstein cow. The native breeds are rich in the A2 variety of beta casein protein which aides easy digestion whereas milk from European Bos taurus contain the A1 variant of the beta casein protein which is related to allergies and some serious health conditions. The Holstein breeds found their way into India as a result of Operation Flood of late 1960s through cross breeding to increase the low milk yield of native breeds. As the Jersey cow can yield nine times the quantity of milk as a zebu in the same period, there is concern among protesters that without jallikattu providing an economic incentive for the breeding of zebu, the breed will become endangered and eventually extinct. PETA disputes the allegation that outlawing jallikattu would lead to a loss of the Tamil Nadu zebu, stating that the bulls can still be used as studs regardless of whether jallikattu is legal or not. Support from various groups, including film actors, politicians, cricketers and other sportsmen, social activists, and authors. Raghava Lawrence, actor Silambarasan, director V. Gowthaman, Seeman, Samuthirakani, Ameer, RJ Balaji, Aari, Mansoor Ali Khan and G. V. Prakash Kumar took part actively during the protests. Spiritual leaders like Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, and Sadhuguru Jaggi Vasudev also spoke in support of the sport. The protestors rejected any attempt for leadership by politicians and celebrities and wished to remain a leaderless mass movement. On 19 January 2017, film composer A. R. Rahman announced that he will observe a day-long fast in support of the protesters, and for 'Tamil Nadu's spirit'.  Opposition  The main opposition of jallikattu comes from the Indian branch of the international non-governmental organization People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA). PETA's opposition is also shared by the Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI), Federation of Indian Animal Protection Organisations and Compassion Unlimited Plus Action (CUPA). Judges of the Supreme Court of India have likewise criticized the Indian Central Government's support of jallikattu just because it is a tradition and have voiced their opposition of it. The Supreme has held that the sport is inherently cruel in nature and this deprives the animal of its basic right to live without subject to fear and torture. The judgement also clarifies that the sport is neither religious ritual nor an essential sport for the Tamil community as the sport is played only in few districts of central Tamil Nadu and not in all districts. The sport has claimed multiple lives including those of the tamers, onlookers and the police. The first ban on jallikattu was a result of a case filed by the father of a tamer who lost his life in the event. PETA denies that ending the jallikattu event will lead to the loss of the native bull, and has pointed out that bulls can be used as studs regardless of whether or not they are engaged in jallikattu. Furthermore, PETA claims that veterinarians can determine which bulls are healthiest with far more scientific rigor than jallikattu can.  Nature of protest  The protests were spontaneous and had no specific organizers. The protest started as Occupy Marina protest along with sit-ins at large grounds across the state. The protests were initially formed by members of Student community across the state which was further strengthened by people from various sections such as IT professionals who joined later. The lack of leader was seen as stumbling block for the state government because it could not call people for talks. The protest were largely peaceful except few Baton charge by the police. The protests are not just confined to Chennai but thousand gathered across the state in prominent places such as MGR Circle in Trichy, Thamukam Grounds in Madurai, VOC Ground in Coimbatore, VOC Ground-Tirunelveli, VOC Ground in Erode, Vellore Fort in Vellore, Salem, Nagercoil, Thanjavur and Puducherry. Tamil youths from other states express solidarity with jallikattu protesters in Tamil Nadu. There was demonstration in Bengaluru, Mumbai, Ahmedabad, and Delhi. Support for the protest also came from Tamils around the world such as in Sri Lanka, the United Kingdom, Germany, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Malaysia, Canada, China, Russia, Switzerland, Ireland, Japan, the United Arab Emirates, the United States, France, South Africa, and Finland. The protest was primarily coordinated using social media apps. The use of memes has been another feature to spread the message that adds satire and humor to the protests. Various traditional Tamil sports such as Silambattam, stilt performances and street plays are performed to showcase Tamil pride along with speeches to inspire the crowd. Slogans were shouted against the animal rights organization PETA, alleging an international conspiracy favoring extinction of Tamil Nadu's rare cattle breed, and replacing them with Jersey cows from Denmark and Switzerland.http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/tamil-nadu- imports-540-jersey-cows-from-switzerland/articleshow/56643976.cms  Impact  The Marina Protest had varied impacts in different walks of life: # The legalization of Jallikattu by the student protest gave impetus to a similar student protest in the neighboring state, Karnataka for the support of conducting their traditional buffalo race, 'kambala' and banning of PETA, Andhra Pradesh in support of special status. # Traders and various colleges in Tamil Nadu have called for the ban on aerated multi-national brands like Pepsi and Coca-Cola with effect from 1 March 2017 and replace them with localised drinks like tender coconut and fresh juices. # Poor public turn out on the Republic day parade in Chennai, condemning the Police charge on the students. # Declaration of Marina as out of bounds for future protests.

Elections were held in the Colony of Western Australia in December 1890 to elect 30 members to the Legislative Assembly. They were the first elections to be held for the Legislative Assembly, which had been created earlier in the year by a new constitution that granted Western Australia responsible self-government. Background Historian Brian De Garis describes the 1890 election as \\"a rather quiet affair\\". There were no organised political parties (or even factions), and no government to be voted in or out of office. The Legislative Assembly had been established by Western Australia's new constitution, which was enacted by the Parliament of the United Kingdom on 21 August 1890 and proclaimed in Perth on 21 October 1890. Prior to that, the Legislative Council, an only partially elective body, had been the sole chamber of parliament.

Prior to the election, there had been some doubts expressed (notably by Septimus Burt) as to whether enough suitable candidates would come forward.De Garis, p. 65. In several uncontested electorates, an informal election was held before the official polling day, in which members of local organisations determined their preferred representative. Aftermath The Governor of Western Australia, Sir William Robinson, decided that he would not commission a government until the elections had been held. It had initially been assumed that Stephen Henry Parker would be chosen as Western Australia's first premier, but John Forrest actively sought the position, arguing that he was the only candidate with prior governmental experience (as a former Surveyor-General). Governor Robinson asked Forrest to form a government on 22 December 1890, and he and the rest of his new ministry were sworn in on 29 December.De Garis, p. 64.

Background Stephen Wallis 'Pop' Merrihew was born on October 14, 1862, in Wilmington, Delaware. He was the son of Captain Stephen Wallis Merrihew and Caroline (Starr) Merrihew. His name was usually written as S. Wallis Merrihew. American Lawn Tennis magazine Merrihew founded American Lawn Tennis (ALT) magazine in 1907 as the official organ of the United States Lawn Tennis Association (USLTA). In the magazine he supported Bill Tilden in his dispute with the USLTA regarding the player- writer rule. As a result the USLTA no longer allowed ALT to be published as its official organ. Merrihew sold the magazine in October 1942 although he remained an editor and writer of his column 'Intimate Talks with my Readers' until his death. Personal life In 1894 Merrihew married Hetty K. Lawson from whom he separated in 1921. In 1934, after his ex-wife's death, he married Daisy Smith. Stephen Wallis Merrihew died on March 21, 1947 at the age of 84 in Laurel, Mississippi.

The novel is set in the Regency period, during the Napoleonic Wars. Plot The novel follows the adventures of Anthony Lammas, the young Professor of Logic and Rhetoric at St Andrews, who is drawn into a plot to kill the Prime Minister. The Free Fishers of the title are a secret organisation, previously smugglers, who provide support to the hero. After a series of adventures on the Northumberland moors, Lammas ultimately rejects success in order to return to his \\"little study and the drawer with the manuscripts of his great treatise on the relation of art and morals\\".  Critical reception David Daniell, in The Interpreter's House (1975), states that the novel is as fresh and engaging as Witch Wood is dark and suffocating. The exuberance of action does not swamp the plotting, and there are some fine assured touches. The technical details of high-speed pre-railway coaching are displayed with an easy mastery. Buchan's biographer Andrew Lownie, writing in 2013, notes that the novel has never been one of Buchan's most popular as it lacks the complexities of his other historical novels and the narrative pace of his \\"shockers\\". He considers it nevertheless to have a charm of its own.

In his baseball career, Hyde played with the Memphis Red Sox, Birmingham Black Barons, Indianapolis Athletics, and the Cincinnati Tigers, as well as various teams from other leagues. An exceptional base stealer and above-average contact hitter, albeit with a low walk-ratio, Hyde participated in two East-West All-Star Games.  Life and career  Hyde was born in Pontotoc, Mississippi, acquiring his baseball and lifelong nickname, \\"Bubba\\", during childhood from his sister. At an early age, Hyde's athletic talents became apparent to chief scouts of the Memphis Red Sox, who offered Hyde the opportunity to tryout with the team when he was just 14 years-old. However, after a brief stint with the club, Hyde suffered from homesickness and decided to return to Pontotoc to finish high school. Still, the Red Sox expressed great interest in him, convincing Hyde to return to the team in 1927, hitting a .190 batting average on the season. He furthered his education by attending Morris Brown College and Rust College, where he joined the baseball, football, and track teams. In 1930, Hyde had another brief stint in the Negro leagues, playing with the Birmingham Black Barons and batting .237. An athlete of modest stature, 5 feet 8 inches and 150 lbs., Hyde compensated for his lack of size with his tremendous speed and agility. Playing with the Indianapolis Athletics in 1937, Hyde made an impression on manager Double Duty Radcliffe who signed him to the Cincinnati Tigers. When Radcliffe moved to the Red Sox organization the following season, he immediately signed Hyde to the club as the starting left fielder, starting a 12-year stint with the team. Because of his above-average power hitting and speed, Radcliffe regularly penciled Hyde into the leadoff spot and gave him the \\"green light\\" to steal whenever he had a sizable lead. Throughout the remainder of his Negro league career, Hyde consistently batted around .300, albeit with a low walk-ratio, and participated in the East-West All-Star Game in 1943 and 1946. Aside from the Negro leagues, Hyde spent parts of 1940 in the Mexican league, averaging .306, before venturing to Chicago to play with the Palmer House All-Stars. A prime candidate to earn a roster spot on a Major League Baseball club, in 1950 he joined the Bridgeport Bees, a minor league affiliate of the Boston Braves organization. In his only season with team, a 40 year-old Hyde batted an impressive .327, earning a position on the Braves' spring training squad, but he was soon cut from the team when Hyde left camp to accompany his pregnant wife to the hospital. Hyde concluded his time in baseball with the Chicago American Giants in 1951, and four years in the Mandak League, where, despite being in his mid-forties, Hyde hit well above .300. Setting in St. Louis, Missouri, he worked for the General Cable company before retiring in the mid-1980s. He was among the first players inducted into the Negro Leagues Wall of Fame and Hyde had his uniform displayed in the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum. Before succumbing to an illness on November 20, 2003, Hyde held the distinction of participating in the Negro Leagues earlier than any other surviving player.

The theoretical background of the work was published by Peter Goldreich and - his postdoc at the time - Nick Kylafis in a series of two papers in The Astrophysical Journal. The GK effect predicts that, under special conditions, the spectral lines emitted by interstellar molecules should be linearly polarized and the linear polarization vector should reveal the magnetic field direction in the molecular cloud. Even a ŒºG magnetic field is enough for this effect. The lines arise from rotational transitions of molecules, say J=1 to J=0, where J is the rotational quantum number. If the magnetic sublevels of the J=1 level are equally populated, as it is usually the case, then the line is unpolarized. However, if the magnetic sublevels are unequally populated, then the line is polarized. Goldreich & Kylafis (1981) showed that, if the radiation field (their own plus external) in which the molecules are embedded is anisotropic, then the magnetic sublevels are unequally populated. Since isotropic radiation fields are practically non existent in Nature (e.g. only at the center of an isolated perfectly spherical molecular cloud), the effect should be easily detectable. This, however, is not the case, because some specific conditions are required. These are that the line optical depth of the molecular cloud should be of order unity and that the radiative rates should be comparable to or larger than the collisional rates. Since the observed lines from molecular clouds are broad, due to velocity gradients in the cloud, the GK effect has the potential to reveal the magnetic field direction along the line of sight. It has been reported in star forming regions and recently in thermal-pulsating (TP-) AGB stars.

Research   Cuba  In Cuba Elise Andaya focused on how the fall of the Soviet Union effected economics and ideals and in turn how they changed views on reproduction, gender, and kinship strategies as well as prenatal care. Andaya interviewed lay people as well as medically trained professionals. She visited neighborhood clinics and attended consultations pertaining to reproduction. The objective of her research was to explore the way changes in politics and economics effect families and reproduction. Her research culminated multiple publications. In April 2014 her book \\"Conceiving Cuba: Reproduction, Women, and the State in the Post-Soviet Era\\" was published by Rutgers University Press, and is taught at Princeton University in the class \\"Medicine and Society in Contemporary Cuba\\". In 2007 she published her dissertation \\"Reproducing the Revolution: Gender, Kinship, in Contemporary Cuba\\". Her dissertation argues that Cuba's struggling economy is connected to low fertility rates. She asserts that the government's lack of care, men's general indifference toward children, and the difficulty of obtaining contraceptives cause women to seek abortions. In 2009 her article \\"The Gift of Health\\" was published. This article discussed how larger changes in socialism effect the care of patients. Andaya argues that due to the destabilization of the Cuban Government, healthcare no longer follows the socialist idea of egalitarianism, instead it is based on small \\"gifts\\" given as payment for the doctor. Andaya argues that this represents the beginning of a market economy. Andaya's work was reviewed by Latin American Politics & Society which wrote that her \\"study succeeds in giving us a subtle and complex picture (which broad-brush approaches cannot) of how the complicated, and often contradictory politics and policies of reproduction emerged in Cuba after 1959.\\" The Journal of Pan African Studies writes that Andaya's book, Conceiving Cuba: Reproduction, Women, and the State in the Post-Soviet Era, \\"considers not only how socialist policies have profoundly affected the ways Cuban families imagine the future, but also how the current crisis in reproduction has deeply influenced ordinary Cubans' views on socialism and the future of the revolution.\\"  New York  She recently conducted a five-year observation period of the practices surrounding breast feeding in Bronx, New York City. She focused on one public hospital to observe and examined how health care and health-seeking for women who work in low-paying service-center jobs was affected by time and scheduling issues. She is currently working with social scientists to synthesize the information she collected.  Grants  In April 2004 she was awarded a grant from the Wenner-Gren Foundation to do research for her dissertation. She conducted participant observation in Havana, Cuba for her dissertation: \\"Reproducing the Revolution: Gender, Kinship, and the State in Contemporary Cuba\\", which was supervised by Dr. Rayna Rapp.  Awards  * \\"Conceiving Cuba: Reproduction, Women, and the State in the Post-Soviet Era\\" received the title of best book about reproduction in 2014 from the Adele E. Clark Book Awards. * \\"Conceiving Cuba: Reproduction, Women, and the State in the Post- Soviet Era\\" received an honorable mention for a first book in feminist Anthropology from the Michelle Z.

It stars Ekaterina Tishkevich and Marina Dyakonenko with Valentin tomusyak, Oleksandr Zadniprovsky and Aleksandr Davydor. It is an emotional family drama, which was adapted from the successful South Korean TV series Ice Adonis and was first serialized on TVN in 2015. It aired primetime in 2015 on TVN for 100 episodes of 45 minutes. It even reached the heights of success in India.  Synopsis  Framed for a murder that she did not commit, Nadya makes a daring escape from the prison to stop her stepsister Irina from marrying Igor Panin, the man that they both love. As they clash, we learn the truth about who killed Igor's sister and begin to understand the depth of the hatred between the two. Nadya must continue to fight to prove her innocence as well as to expose the corrupt business empire that Irina's family have built their name on. The serial starts from the point when Nadya escapes from the jail and reaches the place where Irina's wedding was to be held and tries to make her confess for her wrong deeds on the terrace. Just then Igor comes on the terrace and tells Nadya to leave Irina. In the hustle, Nadya falls off the terrace. Both Irina and Nadya are taken to hospital where Nadya is again sent to jail and her punishment was increased by 2 years. After completing her imprisonment, she makes her mind to take revenge from Irina's family . She is now living with her friend Katya. Katya was with her since she was in prison. They joined a company \\"Bori link\\" a telecom service provider company with the help of Oleg, Igor's step brother who is a good friend of Boris, the owner of Bori link. Boris was also the fianc√© of Igor's sister Margarita Panin who died in a car accident. Boris didn't like Nadya in the beginning as he considers her the murderer of his beloved girlfriend Rita but soon Nadya wins his trust and makes him believe that she isn't the murderer and also helps Boris to take Bori link to new heights. She becomes a star after featuring in a TV advertisement of Bori link and she then decides that it is the right time to join \\"PAN Cosmetics\\" again. (It is the same company which humiliated her in a case of Confidential Data Transfer to the rival company which was again done by Irina but she framed and accused Nadya for this case). Oleg falls in love with Nadya and helps her in her painful years by hiding his identity with the name of \\"Ham\\". Irina is trying to send Nadya back to prison through her smart tricks and Nadya is continuously giving response to her in an equally smart manner. Nadya is now more determined because of the push she got from her mother's death. Soon Irina's grandmother Tamara learns that Nadya's son Yaroslav was illegally adopted by a family and they're currently living in Montenegro which is again a plan and conspiracy of Irina. Meanwhile, Anastasia Sturva, an investor in PAN Cosmetics and also the real mother of Igor joins hands with Nadya in her revenge plans. Now Irina sees everything loose through her hands as Nadya's son Yaroslav returns and is staying at her grandmother Tamara's house. Meanwhile, Igor finds a pendant ring in his room which he'd given to Nadya when he'd proposed her. He asks about it to Irina but she again lies about it and says that Nadya gave her that ring. Igor doesn't believe it and asks the truth about that ring to Nadya. When asked by Igor about that ring, Nadya refuses that she ever gave it to Irina. After that Nadya clearly understands that she'd given this ring to his son and now it's confirmed that Irina was the real murderer of his son. Boris and Igor both are engaged in finding evidence against Irina for Rita's accident. They both find evidence against the corrupt investigator Kierev. Nadya's revenge plan against Irina's family continues, she helps them in getting a higher position in politics and then she blackmails them to leave their seat in politics (she had an evidence against them i.e. video clips) as Irina comes to know from a TV show about how corrupt Nicolive is, Irina's father make's the producer of the TV show to stop the show. Nadya then threatens Nicolive to stop doing all this. Katya plans a party with her boyfriend Kulick for Boris, Olya, Igor, Nadya and the two kids- Andre and Yaroslav. Irina is continuously following them. Katya and the group plan to go to the hillside in Boris' minivan. While Katya and Kulick chat along with Andre in Boris' getaway home, Nadya and Igor go for a roam in the hill with Yaroslav. Sensing an opportunity, Irina attacks Nadya .Yaroslav sensing danger runs back to the house to alert the adults. Irina escapes but soon she is caught by the police. Margarita Panin's murder case is reopened and irina, her father Nicolive and investigator Kireiv are found guilty. The story takes a three-year leap and shows that Nadya and Igor have reunited.

It rises on the eastern flank of the 495 m (1,624 ft)-high hill of Snowdon on Dartmoor, at . It was once a much longer stream, but its headwaters were long ago captured by the River Mardle, and the physical evidence of this stream capture is clear when viewed from higher up the side of Snowdon. Its course is generally eastwards, and for the first three-quarters of its length it flows roughly parallel to the River Mardle, only about 700 m (about half a mile), north of that river. As Holy Brook comes off the moor, it flows through Gibby Combe Wood and then through Michel Combe, a steep-sided valley (or combe) which is just to the south of the hamlet of Michelcombe. It then passes between the villages of Scorriton (to the south) and Holne, and as it approaches the River Dart it flows through a wooded valley that forms the southern boundary of Hembury Woods, below Hembury Castle.Ordnance Survey. 1:25,000 scale map of Dartmoor.

From this bridge to its confluence with the River Dart near the grounds of Buckfast Abbey at , Holy Brook forms the boundary between the Teignbridge and South Hams districts. The first known documentary reference to the stream appears in the 13th-century cartulary of Buckfast Abbey, in which it is called Nordbroc and Northbroke (\\"north brook\\"), probably because of its course just to the north of the River Mardle. A report on folklore published by the Devonshire Association in 1976, states that the name \\"Holy Brook\\" is not an ancient one, though it notes that two fields named \\"Paternoster\\" lie on its course. It has been proved, the report says, that its water is slightly radioactive and, according to the Holne branch of the Women's Institute, it was still believed in 1976 to have curative powers: strained muscles, bruises and rheumatism could all be alleviated by wading in its waters.

In May 2016, Zainuri was declared \\"public enemy No 1\\" by Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia Ahmad Zahid Hamidi due to his skills in the construction of improvised explosive devices. He was killed by an airstrike on Raqqa during Operation Wrath of Euphrates.  Biography   Early life and War in Afghanistan  Zainuri was born around 1966/67 in Bota, Perak, and studied at Madrasah Misbahul Falah, Baling District, Kedah before continuing his studies at the Abu Bakar Islamic University in Karachi, Pakistan. There, he joined the Islamist group Kumpulan Mujahidin Afghanistan and went to Afghanistan, fighting against the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan for two years. Zainuri participated in battles in Kunar Province, Khost Province and the Battle of Jalalabad, gaining \\"vast battlefield experience\\". Afterwards, he returned to Malaysia, where he worked as a technician, though sometime in the 1990s he also began to plan terrorist attacks in his homeland. In 1998, Zainuri was working on a bomb; the device exploded prematurely, destroying his home and killing his wife, Rahimah Osman. He managed to cover this up by telling the police that the detonation was the result of a failing gas cylinder. Over fifteen years later, Zainuri admitted to other ISIL fighters that he still felt guilty about his first wife's death. Despite this, he never told Rahimah's younger sister, whom he eventually married, that he was responsible for Rahimah's death.  Activity as KMM leader  Around 1998, he joined Kumpulan Mujahidin Malaysia (KMM), and became the chief of the group's Selangor chapter. According to the Malaysian Special Branch, Zainuri was linked to the attempted assassination of Nivashini Rajeswaran on 25 May 1998, and the assassination of Lunas assemblyman Dr Joe Fernandez. In 2000, he and another KMM militant were involved in bomb attacks in Kuala Lumpur. Zainuri also participated in a KMM raid on the Guar Chempedak police station with the aim of capturing M16 rifles for the insurgency against the government, and helped planning the Southern Bank robbery in Petaling Jaya in 2001, in course of which the KMM militants hoped to acquire funds for their rebellion. Zainuri did not participate in the heist himself, however, deeming it to risky; when his accomplices were promptly caught, they betrayed him to the police. When he was arrested, the police seized \\"firearms, ammunition and several types of explosives\\" in his house. For his involvement in the robbery, and the possession of firearms and explosives, Zainuri was jailed for ten years under the Internal Security Act 1960.  Operations in Syria and death  After being released, Zainuri left Malaysia in April 2014 and travelled to Syria to fight in the local civil war; he left his second wife, Rahimah's sister, behind. In Syria, Zainuri initially joined Ajnad al-Sham, but soon switched allegiance to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. In August 2014, he and another former KMM member, Zainan Harith, were ambushed by the Syrian Army; Zainan was killed, while Zainuri was wounded at the neck and thigh. At some point, he became one of the commanders of the Malay-speaking ISIL frontline unit Katibah Nusantara. In this position, Zainuri recruited new members for ISIL through Facebook, trained child soldiers for Katibah Nusantara, and issued orders to ISIL cells in Malaysia. Due to his activities and his status as \\"rather influential personality\\" among ISIL supporters, he was closely monitored by the Royal Malaysia Police. Zainuri won some renown by appearing in an ISIL propaganda video in May 2016, during which he burned his Malaysian passport to show that he had severed all links to his homeland's government. He also said that one day the Malay Archipelago would be \\"swarming\\" with ISIL fighters who would bring the fight to Indonesia and Malaysia, the latter of which he called an \\"infidel state\\" with its people being \\"sinners\\". After this appearance in a propaganda video, the Malaysian police learned of his experience in building improvised explosive devices and his desire to share these skills with other ISIL fighters.

The mobile-only service provides accounts in Pounds sterling, Euros and Romanian leu, and is available in 31 countries across the European Economic Area. As of January 2020, it has over 2 million customers. History Monese was founded by Norris Koppel, an entrepreneur from Estonia. Koppel moved to the United Kingdom and had his application for a current account at a major high-street bank declined because he could not provide local proof of address and did not yet have credit history in the UK. This experience led Koppel to vow that one day he would launch a banking service that did not exclude customers based on their residency or lack of credit history. The company completed its seed round in May 2015, raising $1.8 million from Seedcamp, early Spotify investor Shakil Khan and several other angel investors. Monese launched its first product, an instant-to-open mobile current account in the UK, on 21 September 2015. Prior to the launch of its current account it was reported that over 56,000 customers pre-registered for service and joined a waiting list to be granted access. Monese is able to provide banking services to resident and non- resident customers, and has an account opening process that can be completed on a customer's smartphone in under three minutes. Monese closed its Series A round in January 2017, announcing a $10 million raise from Anthemis Exponential Ventures, STE capital, and Korea Investment Partners, Smartcap and Seedcamp. Later that year it launched European accounts. Its next funding round, $60 million as part of Series B, was announced on 6 September 2018, and was led by Swedish investment company Kinnevik AB, with participation from PayPal, Augmentum Fintech, British Airways owner International Airlines Group and Investec's INVC fund.

Year 2011 curated by Vittorio Sgarbi.  History  Designed by the artist as a great functional sculpture, the monumental work is opened, therefore, the architecture used to be inhabited and lived. Not a protective helmet so, but the helmet that becomes a \\"home thinking\\". The largest facility dedicated to the leader capuano Ettore Fieramosca has a height of nine meters, a diameter of six and a weight of 15 tons and will be the place of reception, a physical and virtual space of the city of Capua, a window on the world, but especially local icon. The helmet itself as a kind of urban-scale structure, the only example in Italy, whose artistic value is combined with the info-point function for tourists and usable inside. But Fieramosca Infopoint Monument is also and above all a monumental work in a new context, which is the architectural and urban Cosmo16, a multipurpose space to serve the city and the traveler. In this urban space helmet it stands as a thoughtful sentinel to defend the territory. Piazza Umberto I becomes an area of services capable of hosting a multi-storey car park which offers, for its strategic position and the geometry of space, to serve as a support of the complex knot of collective public activities, trade and services included in the walls of the nearby historic town. The vast space of about 6,000 square meters will house, therefore, a two-level underground parking for a total of about 250 cars. The initiative is not missed the support of CIRA, the Italian Aerospace Research Centre, capuana excellence in the technology sector, which has given its contribution by sharing innovative path linked to the event.  Critical aspect  As we know the Elmo has already been at the Venice Biennale in 2011, and already is part of the historical and international artistic heritage, and not only of Capua. And so the story is confronted with the contemporary in a very strong allowing everyone to get into this confrontation with contemporary art. Piazza Umberto I with Cosmo16 can certainly hold its own against the major European markets and around the world. \\" \\"This project - explained the architect Palmiero - was a real gamble, and in the end thanks to a series of structural tricks you managed to counterbalance the sloping sculpture to make it not just the monument of the square but one of its elements , as an integral part of the reports that it will be created. \\" And this reaffirms Antonio Piccolo: \\"This is an ambitious and innovative project. We young local entrepreneurs we believed until the end, we won the race and we managed to achieve it thanks to a real team game. Only in this way it was possible to overcome all the bureaucratic problems. We wanted to give confidence to the younger generation and this new initiative that includes the Elmo and Cosmo16, an open space to the city and for the city. \\" Finally Marcello Del Giudice stresses the key role of Fonderia Nolana Del Giudice, right by the right arm, which works by four generations with national and international artists. He adds: \\"This project for its complexity is not only a work of contemporary art, but represented a real challenge, a source of pride for us and for the city itself, considering the use of a very old technique, the technique in investment casting that gave birth in the past in important works such as the Riace Bronzes.

Normal-Grotesk is a sans-serif typeface that was sold by the Haas Type Foundry (Haas'sche Schriftgiesserei) of Basel and M√ºnchenstein, Switzerland, and popular in Swiss graphic design towards the end of the metal type period in the mid-twentieth century. As the name suggests, Normal-Grotesk is a ‚Äúneutral‚Äù and functional design on the \\"grotesque\\" model popular in nineteenth and twentieth century Germany, with a minimal design lacking decorative features. The typeface is slightly condensed, with almost straight-sided capitals in the regular weight, similar to DIN 1451 and Roboto; the 'r' has a droop and the 'g' is single- storey. Old≈ôich Hlavsa‚Äôs textbook A Book of Type and Design describes it as ‚Äúa most useful version of the refined display sans-serif, with a perfectly balanced design of the lower-case.‚Äù Around the mid-1950s, a decline in sales took hold of Normal-Grotesk and the Haas Foundry's other grotesque 'Franz√∂sische Grotesk', as the Akzidenz-Grotesk of Berthold became more popular. This led the Haas Foundry to create ‚ÄúNeue Haas Grotesk‚Äù, later renamed Helvetica, in response. Indra Kupferschmid, an expert on German and Swiss printing history, describes it as a ‚Äúreworking of ‚ÄúNeue Moderne Grotesk‚Äù, originally ca. 1909 by Wagner & Schmidt, Leipzig. Initially issued by Haas under the name ‚ÄúAccidenz-Grotesk‚Äù, later spelled ‚ÄúAkzidenz-Grotesk‚Äù. In 1943 Haas added a regular weight offered under the name ‚ÄúNormale Akzidenz- Grotesk‚Äù. In 1954, the whole family was revised and renamed ‚ÄúNormal-Grotesk‚Äù, also to prevent confusion with [the Berthold Type Foundry‚Äôs] Akzidenz- Grotesk.‚Äù Several characters were reworked to make the forms more contemporary.

On 10 July 1968, torrential rainfall, with falling in 18 hours on Chew Stoke, double the area's average rainfall for the whole of July, led to widespread flooding in the Chew Valley, and water reached the first floor of many buildings. The damage in Chew Stoke was not as severe as in some of the surrounding villages, such as Pensford where it swept away the bridge over the A37 and damaged the railway viaduct so badly that it never reopened. It also flooded 88 properties in Chew Magna with many being inundated with of water. Fears that the Chew Valley Lake dam would be breached caused considerable anxiety. On the southern side of the Mendip Hills at Cheddar the flow of water swept large boulders down the gorge and damaged the cafe and entrance to Gough's Cave, washing away cars.

Playing at wing-forward, McKenzie was first selected for the New Zealand national team on their 1893 tour of Australia, and continued to be selected up until the end of New Zealand's 1897 tour of Australia. In his 20 matches for the national side, McKenzie scored 23 points. McKenzie was first selected provincially for Wairarapa in 1889 at the age of 18. He eventually relocated to Wellington in 1893, and joined the Petone Rugby Club. He was selected for Wellington that year, and was included in the New Zealand team to tour Australia. The 1893 tour of Australia was the first New Zealand team selected under the authority of the newly formed New Zealand Rugby Football Union. Captained by Thomas Ellison, the team played eleven matches, including three against New South Wales, and lost only one. McKenzie, playing at wing-forward, appeared in nine matches on the tour, including the team's only loss, which was to New South Wales. He did not appear in any test matches as New Zealand did not play its first full international until 1903. McKenzie became infamous for being the first New Zealand player ordered off. In the last of the tour's matches against New South Wales referee Edward McCausland ordered McKenzie from the field. In the process of walking off McKenzie feigned a leg injury by limping, and the crowd, unaware he had been sent off and now believing he was injured, applauded him. When New South Wales toured New Zealand in 1896 McKenzie was selected for the New Zealand team that faced them, and he played for his country again in 1896 when Queensland toured New Zealand. The following year New Zealand again toured Australia, with McKenzie selected in the Alfred Bayly captained team. The side won nine of their ten matches, with their one loss coming against New South Wales. McKenzie was regarded, along with a few others at the time, as one of the most gifted thinkers in New Zealand rugby, and he played a pivotal role in developing the unique wing- forward position. He was also the eldest of a highly influential rugby family; his younger brothers Jack, Ted, Bert, and Norman all made significant contributions to the sport in New Zealand as administrators, selectors, referees, or players. Newspaper career In 1903, McKenzie began working for the Wairarapa Leader newspaper, which was subsequently subsumed by the Wairarapa Daily News. He then moved to The Dominion in Wellington as circulation manager and organiser, before accepting a position at The New Zealand Herald. Eventually McKenzie, afflicted by rheumatism, moved to Melbourne, Australia, for health reasons, where he was circulation manager for The Herald and The Sun. McKenzie died suddenly in the Melbourne suburb of Caulfield on 1 July 1943, and was buried at Box Hill Cemetery.

She was awarded Doctor of Medicine June 17, 1897 by Northwestern University. She volunteered her medical services at Hull House, a settlement house in Chicago that was founded in 1889. She encouraged other women to become physicians and was the president of the National Medical Women's Association.  Sex Education and Birth Control  She was a proponent of birth control and a leader in the birth control movement in the United States. She was a frequent contributor to the Birth Control Review. She served on the committee of the First American Birth Control Conference. Blount gave lectures on \\"sex hygiene\\" to Chicago high schools, clubs and to universities. She created pamphlets, such as A Talk With Mothers, which discussed condom use. She believed that \\"shielding women\\" from information about sexually transmitted disease was wrong. When it was still illegal to do so, Blount gave out information about birth control in direct violation of laws against discussing birth control in order to test those laws. ‚ÄúIn the Chicago Citizens Committee for Birth Control was active Anna Blount, member of the CWC, who in the twenties emphasized the necessity of increasing the number of women among physicians. Nota bene, her guide on birth control was titled: A Talk to Mothers by a Doctor Who is a Mother Herself. She introduced herself here as professionally prepared for counseling in the area of birth control, as well as a woman who shared these experiences with other women. Her status was legitimized by the fact of her having three children and specializing in gynecology and pediatrics.‚ÄùKu≈∫ma-Markowska, Zdrowe Matki, Chichiane Dzieci, pages 193-194 Dr. Blount also supported the idea of eugenics. Blount called eugenics \\"the most important movement of modern times.\\" She chaired the Eugenics Education Society of Chicago. Blount believed that people should choose to have children with only the most mentally and physically healthy individuals. She believed that \\"cruelty is a hereditary characteristic.\\" She connected alcoholism with heredity as well. Blount even believed that lowering the population size would prevent war and world hunger. Blount did not believe that people who were unhappy with one another should stay married, and proposed that obtaining a divorce should be made easier in the courts. She advocated that juries on divorce trials should be made up of women.  Woman's Suffrage  Dr. Blount was a leader in the women's suffrage movement. She was a member of the Chicago Woman's Club and the Nineteenth Century Woman's Club of Oak Park.Poplett and Porucznik, The Woman Who Never Fails, page 14. Blount spoke out against club organizations attempting to prevent African American women from joining. Concerning Dr. Blount's involvement in the woman's suffrage movement, The Gentle Force says, \\"Dr. Anna Blount and Grace Wilbur Trout ... achieved state-wide reputations as leaders for the cause, and both served on the Municipal Suffrage Commission in Illinois, as did Club members Grace Hall Hemingway and Anna Lloyd Wright. Dr. Blount was an active physician and surgeon, with a specialty in obstetrics and gynecology. She campaigned vigorously for suffrage, and in 1906 she, along with Elizabeth Ball and Phoebe Butler, established the Suburban Civics and Equal Suffrage Association (later the League of Women Voters). According to the local paper, this Association was founded by 'some of the most prominent women in Illinois, who have made an imperishable record for their service in the cause of woman suffrage.'\\"Poplett and Porucznik, The Gentle Force, page 60. Note that Grace Hall Hemingway was the mother of author Ernest Hemingway and Anna Lloyd Wright was the mother of architect Frank Lloyd Wright. In The Young Hemingway Michael Reynolds says, \\"In 1907, to the amusement of male Oak Parkers, the Illinois Equal Suffrage convention was held at Scoville Institute, where Dr. Anna Blount, a local woman, was the wittiest and most persuasive voice.\\" Michael Reynolds, The Young Hemingway, Basil Blackwell, 1986, p 12. . Concerning Blount's high reputation, at pages 106-107 Reynolds states, \\"In those days in Oak Park, wives were known in the newspaper by their husbands' names: Mrs. John Farson, Mrs. William Barton. In contrast, Hemingway's mother always appeared as Mrs. Grace Hall Hemingway. Only two other women appeared in such fashion: Dr. Anna Blount, who led the suffragist movement in Oak Park and Illinois, and made contributions at the national level in the fight for the vote; and Belle Watson-Melville, a performer on the national Chautauqua circuit.\\"  Personal life  Dr. Anna Blount and her husband, Ralph Earl Blount, both worked at Hull House.http://janeaddams.ramapo.edu/about-jane-addams/hull-house- residents, retrieved 10/10/2019.

Both Walter and Ruth became doctors, with Ruth, who received her Doctor of Medicine degree from Northwestern University on June 16, 1934, being one of the women \\"encouraged ... to become physicians\\" by her mother, as has been referred to above.‚ÄúProminent Woman‚Äôs Suffrage Workers Have Big Families: Duty of Motherhood Argument for Granting of the Ballot,‚Äù Chicago Sunday Tribune, March 3, 1912, page 75.Ku≈∫ma-Markowska, Zdrowe Matki, Chichiane Dzieci, pages 193-194. Sylwia Ku≈∫ma-Markowska refers to Dr. Blount as \\"a physician, suffragist, and social activist. She graduated in medicine from the Women‚Äôs Medical School of Northwestern University and in gynecology and pediatrics from a university in Munich.‚ÄùKu≈∫ma-Markowska, Zdrowe Matki, Chichiane Dzieci, page 285 Dr. Blount had an active medical practice. For example, she delivered Iovanna, the daughter of Frank Lloyd Wright and his mistress, later wife, Olgivanna Lloyd Wright: \\"On December 2, 1925, at about six o'clock in the evening, Wright received the 'anxiously awaited call' from Dr. Anna Blount, the obstetrician. Wright evaded the photographers by entering the hospital through the rear. 'Dr. Anna Blount herself let me in,' Wright recalled, 'and proudly led me to the room where a little white bundle lay. A delicate pink face showing in the hollow of her mother's arm.'

Dr. Blount's prominence in the Chicago area was illustrated by a 1934 photograph of her, her daughter-in-law, and recently born granddaughter appearing on the front page of the Chicago Herald and Examiner. The caption to the photo reads, \\"ALL SMILES ...

She was a daughter of Barzabod, a Mihranid ruler of Gardman. Sagdukht is primarily known from the Georgian chronicle, written by Juansher c. 800, relating life of King Vakhtang I, the son of Mirdat and Sagdukht. She is also mentioned as Sahakdukht in the works of the 13th-century Armenian historian Vardan. Modern historians such as Ivane Javakhishvili, Simon Janashia, and Cyril Toumanoff identify her with the Sahakdukht recorded in a Georgian inscription on an icon from the Jvarisa church in the village of Znakva. According to Juansher's chronicle, Sagdukht's hand was sought and obtained by Mirdat‚Äîthen heir apparent to his reigning father King Archil‚Äîwho was captivated by Sagdukht's beauty and also sought to ensure the peace between Iberia and Gardman, the Rani (Arran) of the Georgian source. The couple settled at Mirdat's appanage of Samshvilde, where Sagdukht converted to Christianity and built the church of Sioni. Sagdukht gave birth to two daughters, Khvarandze and Mirandukht, and one son, Vakhtang. After Mirdat's death, Sagdukht assumed regency for her underage son under the protection of her father. Later, according to Juansher, Sagdukht and Khvarandze were temporarily left in government of Kartli during Vakhtang's absence on a military expedition against the Alans in the Caucasus Mountains.

This ballot initiative was passed by voters on November 8, 2016 by a 53.57% to 46.43% margin. Initiative 300 is a pilot program which will sunset in 2020 unless extended by city council or an additional voter initiative. Initiative 300 is the first program of its kind to allow designated areas for public consumption of marijuana in the United States, permitting regular businesses, such coffee shops, art galleries, entertainment venues, or even yoga studios, to seek permits for bring-your-own marijuana, over-21 consumption areas that are indoors (allowing vaping and edibles, but not smoking) or outdoors (allowing smoking). Shortly after Initiative 300 passed at the polls, the Liquor Enforcement Division of the Colorado Department of Revenue announced new regulations to prevent bars and many restaurants from applying for new social marijuana use permits. In response to Initiative 300, the Colorado State Legislature began debating Senate Bill 184, introduced to provide consistent guidelines statewide for private marijuana membership clubs. Following the passage of Colorado Amendment 64, allowing the recreational consumption of cannabis, the initiative addresses the challenge of allowing consumption outside of private residences, where options are extremely limited for some members of the public, such as some apartment tenants and tourists. Establishments allowing cannabis consumption will be subject to regulation in a manner similar to alcohol, though will need to garner at least one additional approval from an eligible neighborhood organization prior to applying for a permit with the city. A \\"Social Consumption Advisory Committee\\" including Initiative 300‚Äôs backers and its opponents, community members and business representatives first met on January 18, 2017 to help shape the permit program and regulations. A core issue of the committee's debate is whether cannabis use will be permitted on premises that are licensed for the sale and consumption of alcohol. Proponents of the Initiative 300 argue that allowing consumption in licensed bars and restaurants reflected the original intent of the initiative, which voters approved.  Ballot Question  \\"Shall the voters of the City and County of Denver adopt an ordinance that creates a cannabis consumption pilot program where: the City and County of Denver (the ‚ÄúCity‚Äù) may permit a business or a person with evidence of support of an eligible neighborhood association or business improvement district to allow the consumption of marijuana (‚Äúcannabis‚Äù) in a designated consumption area; such associations or districts may set forth conditions on the operation of a designated consumption area, including permitting or restricting concurrent uses, consumptions, or services offered, if any; the designated consumption area is limited to those over the age of twenty-one, must comply with the Colorado Clean Indoor Air Act, may overlap with any other type of business or licensed premise, and cannot be located within 1000 feet of a school; a designated consumption area that is located outside cannot be visible from a public right-of-way or a place where children congregate; the City shall create a task force to study the impacts of cannabis consumption permits on the city; the City may enact additional regulations and ordinances to further regulate designated consumption areas that are not in conflict with this ordinance; and the cannabis consumption pilot program expires on December 31, 2020 or earlier if the City passes comprehensive regulations governing cannabis consumption?\\"  Committee  The co-chairs of the new advisory committee are Denver licensing director Ashley Kilroy and Molly Duplechian from the city‚Äôs Office of Marijuana Policy. Others on the committee include City Council members Kendra Black and Mary Beth Susman, Deputy Chief David Qui√±ones from Denver police and Marley Bordovsky from the code enforcement section of the City Attorney‚Äôs Office.

General description Beaver Scouts prepare for a game in a Scout hall in East London. A Scout hall typically consists of one or more large rooms which are used for games and Scouting activities, and may also include smaller rooms for committee meetings, storage of camping equipment and a kitchen. When not being used for Scouting, Scout halls are often hired to other community groups, in a similar way to a village hall or community centre. If the Scout hall consists of several large rooms, the various sections can have their own large room. Rooms for younger sections, like Beaver Scouts, Rainbow Guides, Cub Scouts and Brownie Guides are decorated with pictures and objects from their theme. Rooms for older sections are decorated with maps, knots, (small) examples of Scoutcraft and camp souvenirs. In a room for the Scout troop each patrol should have its own section. A Scout hall can be built for this use or a reuse of a building or part of a building that is not well suited for a different purpose. Sea Scout Groups may have an old cargo ship as a movable Scout hall. If there is space available, there is often a small or larger campsite next to a Scout hall. Scout halls are also used, by other Scout Groups, in particular for the younger sections, for camps or sleepovers.  Notable Scout halls  Ulftorp, Bromma. In 1953, the postmodern architect Ralph Erskine erected the Scout hall Ulftorp for the KFUM Brommas Scoutk√•r in Bromma, Sweden. The building on Lov√∂n, lake M√§laren, was designed around a central fireplace heating a large common room and two small rooms on the lower floor as well as a sleeping room on the upper floor. The roof was formed like a campfire mirroring Erskine's idea that everybody should gather around the fire. The Scout hall burned down in the late 1960s. Arkadelphia Boy Scout Hut The Arkadelphia Boy Scout Hut The Arkadelphia Boy Scout Hut, located in Central Park in Arkadelphia, Arkansas in the United States of America, is on the National Register of Historic Places. The hut was constructed from 1938 to 1939 as a National Youth Administration project during the Great Depression. Hawke Scout Hall Hawke Scout Hall is located on the edge of Coxs Bay in Auckland, New Zealand. It originated in 1928 as a boat shed which became the headquarters of Hawke Sea Scouts, A hall was built over the top of the old boat shed in 1943. The whole building was destroyed by fire in 1952; lost amongst the contents was the White Ensign flown by the cruiser during the Battle of the River Plate. It was rebuilt in the following year with help from the local community and the US Marines. Portsoy Scout Hut The 1884 Portsoy railway station, now a Scout hall and a listed building. The wooden building now used as a Scout hall by the 1st Portsoy Scout Group in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, was originally the town's railway station. Built in 1884, the station closed in 1968 and became a Category C listed building in 1995. Scout halls and popular music Because of their availability as a relatively low cost space, Scout halls have sometimes been used by emerging rock or pop bands as a rehearsal or performance venue. Notable examples are: Cream, who initially rehearsed in a Scout hut in north London in July 1966, The Stranglers who rehearsed in a Scout hut at Shalford, Surrey in 1974 and The Undertones, whose first public performance in 1976 was at a Scout hut in Derry. In a 2006 interview, George Michael stated that his first public performance had been with a band in a Scout hut at Bushey in Hertfordshire.

She made about 200 paintings of flowers of the more than 2,000 paintings that she made over her career. One of her paintings, Jimson Weed, sold for $44.4 million, making it the most expensive painting sold of a female artist's work . Background Georgia O'Keeffe, Untitled, vase of flowers, watercolor on paper, , between 1903 and 1905 O'Keeffe experimented with depicting flowers in her high school art class. Her teacher explained how important it was to examine the flower before drawing it. So, O'Keeffe held it in different ways, capturing different perspectives of the flowers, and also created studies of only a portion of the flower. During this process she also drew the flower simpler with each iteration. After she had been painting for a few years, she became discouraged, and when she began painting again, she remembered the technique she had learned earlier to see things in a different way. Influenced by photography By the mid-1920s, O'Keeffe began making large- scale paintings of natural forms at close range, as if seen through a magnifying lens. O'Keeffe learned modernist photography techniques, like close-cropping from, Paul Strand, and others. Strand was particularly influential in her development of cropped, close-up images. She received unprecedented acceptance as a female artist from the fine art world due to her powerful graphic images. Depictions of small flowers that fill the canvas suggest the immensity of nature and encourage viewers to looks at flowers differently. Examples of some of her close-up images of flowers include Oriental Poppies, several Red Canna paintings, and what has been described as her first large-scale flower painting, Petunia No. 2 (1924). Composition and design In 1928, Time magazine wrote of her paintings, \\"when Georgia O'Keeffe paints flowers, she does not paint fifty flowers stuffed into a dish. On most of her canvases there appeared one gigantic bloom, its huge feathery petals furled into some astonishing pattern of color and shade and line.\\" Symbolism Works such as Black Iris III (1926) evoke a veiled representation of female genitalia while also accurately depicting the center of an iris. Alfred Stieglitz, O'Keeffe's husband who promoted her works of art, first espoused the theory that the paintings represented a woman's vulva in the 1920s. Tanya Barson, curator at Tate Modern, stated that male art critics perpetuated this assertion. O'Keeffe consistently and vigorously denied the validity of Freudian interpretations of her art. O'Keeffe, whose comfort with her sexuality is evident in the nude photographs taken of her by her husband Alfred Stieglitz, was not comfortable with the way that the paintings were interpreted as erotic images. This may have more to do with the degrading ways that the paintings were discussed. Stieglitz marketed her flower paintings in sexual terms, including quotes from men who were influenced by Stieglitz's viewpoints. She asked her friend, Mabel Dodge Luhan, to write of her work from a feminine perspective to counter interpretations by men. Judy Chicago gave O'Keeffe a prominent place in her The Dinner Party (1979) in recognition of what many prominent feminist artists considered groundbreaking introduction of sensual and feminist imagery in her works of art,. seeing it as a sign of female empowerment. Beginning July 2016, Tate Modern conducted a retrospective of more than 100 of O'Keeffe's work, in part to provide additional views to the theory that her paintings are depictions of female genitalia.

The Home is split in two, lying on its starboard side, and about to be struck by one particularly large wave. Racers hurricane was a destructive tropical cyclone that had severe effects in northeastern Mexico, the Republic of Texas, and the Gulf Coast of the United States in early October 1837\\\\. It takes its name from the Royal Navy ship HMS Racer, which encountered the cyclone in the northwestern Caribbean Sea. Termed \\"one of the most famous and destructive hurricanes of the century\\" by meteorology historian David Ludlum, the storm first affected Jamaica with flooding rainfall and strong winds on September 26 and 27, before entering the Gulf of Mexico by October 1\\\\. As the hurricane struck northern Tamaulipas and southern Texas, it slowed to a crawl and turned sharply northeastward. The storm battered the Gulf Coast from Texas to the Florida Panhandle between October 3 and 7\\\\. After crossing the Southeastern United States, it emerged into the Atlantic shipping lanes off the Carolinas by October 9. The effects of the tropical cyclone were far-reaching. Matamoros, on the southern bank of the Rio Grande, faced hurricane conditions for several days, with significant damage to ships. Many towns along the Texas shoreline were inundated by storm surge, which flooded the coastal plains for many miles inland. Galveston Island was devastated, with nearly every building washed away and most vessels driven ashore. To the east, a water level rise of on Lake Pontchartrain submerged low-lying areas of New Orleans. Many steamboats on the lake were wrecked and buildings along its shores demolished. Storm surge and wind damage extended into Mississippi and Alabama, but with less severity. In the interior Southeast, sugar cane and cotton crops bore heavy losses. As the weakening storm buffeted the Outer Banks of North Carolina on October 9, the passenger steamship SS Home ran aground about off Cape Hatteras and rapidly broke up in the pounding surf. About 90 passengers and crewmen died in the wreck. Overall, Racers hurricane killed an estimated 105 people. Meteorological history Approximate track of the hurricane from the alt=A map centered on the Gulf of Mexico, including parts of the northern Caribbean Sea, eastern Mexico, the Southeastern United States, and the Western Atlantic. An approximate track of the hurricane has been drawn, appearing as a parabola. Little is known about the origins of the storm. It was first noted at Barbados on September 22, but may have been a Cape Verde type hurricane arising from a westward-moving tropical wave. The intensifying hurricane had passed just south of Jamaica on September 26 and 27,Geiser, p. 60 affecting the island with strong winds and heavy rains. On September 28, HMS Racer, a Royal Navy sloop-of-war, encountered the hurricane in the northwestern Caribbean,Ludlum, p. 145 with winds increasing to force 12 on the evening of September 29.Reid, p. 135 She was dismasted and blown on her beam ends twice before re-righting, losing almost all rigging, navigational tools, and provisions in the process. A young boy died of injuries sustained on the lower deck, and two crewmen went missing.Reid, p. 136 Racer put in to Havana, Cuba, for repairs.Fitzpatrick, p. 190 In recognition of this ordeal, writers and historians have commonly referred to the system as Racers storm or Racers hurricane. As Racer endured the gale, another vessel to her north, HMS Ringdove, felt the storm around the same time. Both ships recorded easterly winds for several days as they traversed the Yucat√°n Channel, indicating that the storm center remained to their south.Reid, p. 133 The hurricane crossed the northern Yucat√°n Peninsula on October 1, passing near M√©rida and Sisal in Yucat√°n before proceeding west- northwestward across the Gulf of Mexico. An unusually large tropical cyclone for most of its course, it peaked at the equivalent of Category 4 or 5 on the modern-day Saffir‚ÄìSimpson scale. The center briefly moved ashore over extreme northern Mexico near the mouth of the Rio Grande by early on October 3. However, a strong high pressure area to the north halted the hurricane's forward progress and redirected it northeastward.Redfield, p. 34 The slow- moving hurricane traced the Texas shoreline for several days from October 3 through October 5, and continued eastward, parallel to the northern U.S. Gulf Coast. It passed the Sabine River on the night of October 5‚Äì6, and made landfall in southeastern Louisiana near Venice. At New Orleans, the worst of the storm came late on October 6 with winds from the south and southeast.Redfield, p. 33 According to weather historian David Ludlum, the storm likely moved ashore between Mobile, Alabama, and Pensacola, Florida. Due to the tight pressure gradient between the storm and an expansive high pressure area centered over the Ohio Valley, damaging winds extended far to the north of the hurricane's track.Ludlum, p. 146 The system moved northeastward across interior Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina. Between October 8 and 10, it battered the Atlantic coast of the Carolinas as a low-end hurricane before emerging into the Atlantic near Wilmington. Over open water, the storm regained some of the strength it had lost over land. It continued northeastward, ultimately passing north of Bermuda and transitioning into an extratropical cyclone.Reid, p. 143 Efforts to reconstruct the hurricane's path began as early as 1838 with the work of Corps of Royal Engineers officer William Reid, who examined logbooks of ships in the Caribbean. American meteorologist William Charles Redfield had been studying the portion of the storm's track over the eastern U.S., but it would not be until 1846 that, based on Reid's work, he recognized it as a continuation of Racers hurricane.Redfield, pp. 31‚Äì32 In following years, Reid and Redfield continued to build upon each other's findings concerning the storm. Impact Ludlum described Racers storm as \\"one of the most famous and destructive hurricanes of the century.\\"Ludlum, p. 144 It killed an estimated 105 people along its course. In Jamaica, heavy rainfall triggered widespread street flooding, forcing nearly all businesses in Kingston to close for the duration of the storm. Along the coast, several ships broke from their moorings; one of them struck a wharf, damaging another vessel, and was scuttled to prevent further destruction.Reid, p. 141 Haiti and the southern shores of Cuba also experienced the storm. Mexico Matamoros, Tamaulipas, on the southern bank of the Rio Grande, experienced the hurricane for several days beginning on October 2.Geiser, p. 61 The hurricane dropped torrential rainfall in parts of northern Mexico that had already experienced above-average precipitation during the late summer. Jean-Louis Berlandier, a Geneva-born naturalist living in Matamoros, measured of rain from October 1‚Äì4, including on October 3. He also wrote extensively of his experiences during the hurricane, during which he was able to hear crashing waves on the coast, some away, and witnessed whitecaps on floodwaters in city streets. Several ships were wrecked along the coast, and the Mexican customs house situated at the mouth of the Rio Grande was destroyed. It was later rebuilt at a more sheltered location farther inland. Texas alt=In 1837, the Republic of Texas claimed a large swath of disputed land to its south and west; it bordered the United States and its territories to the north and east. The storm wrought destruction along the entire coast of Texas (then the sovereign Republic of Texas and disputed Nueces Strip). The settlement at Brazos Santiago was almost totally destroyed, with only a few buildings left standing, while all ships there were sunk or driven aground. Communities along the shores of Matagorda Bay were heavily damaged, with buildings and wharves swept away. Farther north, a storm surge flooded Galveston Island, where nearly every building was lost, along with all supplies and provisions. Of the 30 vessels present in the harbor at Galveston when the storm began, only one remained moored following its passage. In one case, a brig was driven against a three-story warehouse, causing the building to collapse. Among the ships destroyed at Galveston were two Texas Navy schooners. In a scene of \\"utter desolation\\", some individuals in Galveston survived the flooding by holding on to floating debris for days.Ludlum, pp. 145‚Äì146 Floodwaters rushed over coastal prairies for up to , drowning livestock. The storm surge deposited ships in fields several miles inland; near Sabine Pass, a three-masted barque came to rest from the coast. Local residents salvaged its timbers as firewood and building materials for decades to come. Heavy surf action significantly altered the coastline at the entrance to Galveston Bay. Houston experienced a rise in water levels. Despite the damage throughout coastal Texas, only two people are known to have died there, one of them in Galveston. United States In New Orleans, the storm produced an storm surge on Lake Pontchartrain that flooded parts of the city as far south as Burgundy Street, with water deep invading many homes. Strong winds in the city toppled chimneys, brought down trees and fences, and unroofed homes, carrying some roofs up to away from the damaged buildings. In particular, the City Exchange hotel (now the site of the Omni Royal Orleans) was extensively damaged while in the final stages of its construction. Overall, hundreds of structures were damaged or destroyed in New Orleans, and shipping losses took a large economic toll on the city. In the settlement known then as Port Pontchartrain (now part of New Orleans), a pier and breakwater sustained a combined $50,000 (1837 USD) in damage, and most buildings there were swept away. At least one person was killed in the area, and several more went missing while evacuating their homes. Numerous steamboats were wrecked on the shores of Lake Pontchartrain, and much of the Pontchartrain Railroad was flooded or washed out, with damage estimated at $100,000. The hurricane destroyed the original Bayou St. John Light, the first American lighthouse built outside the Thirteen Colonies. Torrential rains overspread areas mainly north of the storm's track; in Clinton, Louisiana, downpours lasted nearly two days. Strong winds destroyed homes and toppled trees in Baton Rouge, and ravaged forests and plantations surrounding the city. Farmers reported up to a third of their sugar cane and cotton crops lost. All the wharves along the coast of Mississippi were destroyed, and the influx of freshwater runoff severely affected the locally prized oyster beds in the Bay of St. Louis. Across Louisiana and Mississippi, the storm killed at least six people. In Mobile, Alabama, the storm uprooted trees and damaged several buildings, including a church. Tides rose several feet above normal, flooding low-lying streets so that fishermen were able to deliver their catches directly to market by boat. Some businesses sustained minor water damage, but overall, the city was spared any significant destruction. There were descriptions of tremendous damage to wharves and warehouses along the coasts of Alabama and the Florida Panhandle, although some accounts may have been exaggerated by rival companies. Many ships were destroyed in Florida's St. Joseph and Apalachicola bays. Throughout the Southeast, the storm caused severe agricultural damage. Major thoroughfares like the Natchez Trace and the Federal Road were made impassable by fallen trees. Reports of strong winds extended as far inland as eastern Tennessee. At Norfolk, Virginia, northeasterly gales on October 8 and 9 kept steamboats at dock. Several ships were lost along the Outer Banks. The schooner Cumberland wrecked on the Core Banks; all crew members survived and some of her cargo was salvaged. To the north, the brig Enterprize was destroyed at Bodie Island with one fatality.Stick, p. 245 One sailor fell overboard and drowned when the schooner Emily ran aground at Swansboro, North Carolina. =SS Home= The newly built passenger steamship SS Home was en route from New York City to Charleston, South Carolina, when she encountered strengthening northeasterly winds on October 8.Ludlum, p. 147 As the storm worsened that night, the 220-foot (67 m) packet ship began to leak because of a broken boiler feed pipe.Fraser, p. 110Howland, p. 18 The next morning, as the Home took on more water than the pumps could handle, the captain steered her aground north of Cape Hatteras. The vessel got underway again shortly thereafter, in an effort to reach the relative shelter of the cape's leeward side and beach her there. All passengers and crewmen were ordered to assist in bailing out the water pouring into the hold, but despite their best efforts, the engine rooms were inundated and the Home was forced to continue under sail. On the night of October 9‚Äì10, the vessel grounded from the shore, just south of Cape Hatteras. The largely submerged Home rapidly broke up amid the hurricane's pounding surf, and of the 130 people aboard the steamboat, only about 40 made it to shore alive: 20 out of 90 passengers and 20 crew members, including the captain. There were only three lifeboats, two of which were destroyed before they could be used; the other capsized shortly after being launched, drowning between 10 and 15 passengers.Fraser, p. 111Howland, p. 29 Two men used the only two life preservers aboard the Home to safely reach the beach.Fraser, p. 111 Among the victims were United States Senator from Georgia Oliver H. Prince and his wife, and numerous relatives of other Congressmen.Fraser, p. 112 The wreck of the Home occurred during a period of increasingly frequent passenger steamship tragedies, and in 1838 Congress passed reformed safety legislation for these vessels.Voulgaris, pp. 3‚Äì4 See also *1830‚Äì39 Atlantic hurricane seasons *Lists of United States hurricanes: **Texas **Florida **North Carolina References Citations Sources   (1837) 1837 Racer 1837 Racer 1837 Racer Racer's Racer's hurricane, 1837 October 1837 events 1837 meteorology ","title":"Racer's hurricane"},{"id":"52914183","text":"Raymond Casey, FRS, FGS (10 October 1917 ‚Äì 26 April 2016) was a British geologist.

CBC News, April 3, 2016. Directed by Laura O'Grady, the film profiles Kelly Hofer, a gay activist and photographer in Calgary who grew up in a Hutterite religious community in southern Manitoba. The film focuses on Hofer's early life within the community, and what eventually forced him to leave and move to Calgary in 2012.\\"Kelly Hofer's loving photos of the Hutterite home he left behind\\". Q, April 12, 2016. The film was released online through the Telus Optik Local platform in Alberta, before being released to YouTube later in the year. The film was also nominated for several awards through the Canadian Screen Awards in 2017 following its release. Plot Queer Hutterite follows the life of Kelly Hofer as he grew up in the Hutterite colony of Green Acres, in southern Manitoba, Canada. The documentary focuses on the early life of Hofer as he grew up discovering his passion for photography in his early teens, while also coming to the discovery that he was gay. He knew that as a gay man, he would face discrimination within the Hutterite community and that he would no longer fit into the fabric of society within the colony. In June 2012, Hofer with the help of his sister who had left the colony years earlier, ran away from his family and the colony to move to Calgary where he could live more openly as himself. The film then moves to focus on Hofer's work as a photographer shedding light on the Hutterites in Canada and to provide support to other LGBTQ members of Hutterite communities. His departure and eventual coming out caused a shift within the Hutterite community as it addressed internal homophobia and the possibility of more people within the colony of being gay. From Calgary, Hofer worked to help set up online forums for people within the Hutterite colonies where they can be more open and possibly even come out as gay themselves. The film finishes by showing the unique photography work that Hofer has focused his life on. With his upbringing within the Hutterite community, he focuses his work to give a glimpse into the world of the Hutterites and break down the barriers and stereotypes that exist between common society and the society of the Hutterite colonies across Canada. The film finishes with a scene with Hofer and his sister reminiscing over old photos of their life within the Hutterite community and Hofer speaking about his hopes that he can one day visit his family again. Reviews The documentary received positive feedback from Canadian news and media outlets. Most coverage of the movie focused on its nominations for awards following its release. In an April 2016 interview on CBC Radio's Q, O'Grady and Hofer talked about the role of the documentary in helping to raise awareness of LGBTQ issues within the Hutterite communities. Impact The film, coupled with Hofer's work both within the LGBTQ community as well as with other former and current Hutterites has garnered some attention, both within and outside Hutterite communities across Canada.

He was previously Chief of Staff for U.S. Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah. Porter resigned his position as White House Staff Secretary after domestic abuse allegations from both of his former wives came to public attention. Early life Porter grew up in Belmont, Massachusetts, and Washington, D.C. He is the son of Roger B. Porter, a former aide to President George H. W. Bush and currently IBM Professor of Business and Government at Harvard University. Porter's mother Ann Porter, who died in May 2017, was Faculty Dean of Harvard's Dunster House dormitory. After graduating from high school, Porter interned in the U.S. Senate. He attended Harvard University, where he studied government and was president of the Harvard Republican Club. After his freshman year at Harvard, he began a two- year stint as a missionary for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in London. During the summer of his junior year, Porter completed an internship at the White House and worked for the Domestic Policy Council. He graduated in 2002. Porter was a Rhodes Scholar, studying Political Theory at the University of Oxford, where his thesis research focused on C.S. Lewis prior to graduation in 2005. Porter then attended Harvard Law School, graduating in 2008, with his Juris Doctor. Political career Porter with President Donald Trump in the Oval Office, January 2017 Porter has worked for Senators Rob Portman and Mike Lee. In March 2014, Porter began working for Senator Orrin Hatch. Porter was initially appointed Deputy Chief of Staff and was promoted to Chief of Staff in June of that year. Porter left the role in January 2017, to become White House Staff Secretary for President Donald Trump. Porter resigned from the position on February 7, 2018, following public allegations of spousal abuse from his two ex-wives. He was succeeded on an acting basis by Derek Lyons. Porter and two other former Trump aides criticized Bob Woodward's book Fear: Trump in the White House in September 2018, with Porter defending the president and saying the book was \\"selective and often misleading\\" in describing the administration. The Wall Street Journal published a pro-Trump opinion article by Porter in March 2019, drawing criticism from his second ex-wife who said Porter must address his personal conduct during marriage before returning to public life. The House Judiciary Committee subpoenaed Porter in August 2019 to testify regarding Trump's actions in response to the Russia investigation, and the White House directed Porter not to testify in September 2019. Personal life In 2003, Porter married Colbie Holderness; they divorced in 2008 and she said he had physically abused her multiple times throughout their marriage. In 2009, he married Jennifer Willoughby. After repeated verbal abuse, she obtained a restraining order against him in 2010. They divorced in 2013. Porter had been dating former White House Director of Communications Hope Hicks, though their relationship ended by December 2018. He is a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He was raised a member of the church and served a full-time, 24-month mission. He became less active in his church around the time of his second divorce. Domestic abuse allegations In late November 2017, a girlfriend of Porter's alerted her friend, White House Counsel Don McGahn, regarding Porter's \\"anger problems\\". Porter's ex-wife Willoughby had sought and received a three-day emergency protective order against him in June 2010. Photographs of Holderness with a black eye and her detailed accounts of Porter's alleged abuse were also made public. Despite their testimonies and evidence presented, Porter denied his ex-wives' allegations and resigned from his staff secretary post after they became public. Willoughby stated \\"I don't want to be married to him. I would not recommend anyone to date him or marry him. But I definitely want him in the White House and the position he is in. I think his integrity and ability to do his job is impeccable.\\" Porter resigned from the position of White House Staff Secretary on February 7, 2018, following public allegations of spousal abuse from his two ex-wives.Jonathan Swan. White House staff secretary Rob Porter resigns amid abuse allegations . Axios. The allegations were supported by photographs of a black eye (which Porter claimed he took) and a restraining order. Porter has said the allegations are false and are part of a \\"coordinated smear campaign\\". The Washington Post reported that White House counsel Donald McGahn had known since January 2017 about the allegations Porter's ex-wives made to the FBI, and that Chief of Staff John F. Kelly had known about the allegations since October 2017, still promoting Porter after. Post reporter Aaron Blake wrote that this development made the allegations a \\"full-blown scandal\\". Asked by reporters two days after Porter's resignation, President Donald Trump commented, \\"He said very strongly yesterday that he's innocent so you have to talk to him about that, but we absolutely wish him well, he did a very good job when he was at the White House.\\" In mid-February 2018, it was reported that Senator Hatch had sent letters to Porter's former wives, apologizing for initially defending Porter in response to their accusations against him. Kelly told reporters on March 2, 2018 that he sought Porter's resignation immediately after learning of the accusations on February 6 and regretted his handling of Porter's departure; he also said that contrary to earlier White House statements, Porter's background check had been completed by the FBI, as had been disputed publicly by bureau director, Christopher Wray.

It has a library, bar, club room, restaurant and grocer. Hotel Emma is named after Emma Koehler, wife of Pearl President Otto Koehler. Architect Maritzen's rendering of Pearl Brewery The structure was originally built in 1894 on 23 acres as the City Brewery (later becoming Pearl Brewery), and for a time was the tallest building in San Antonio. It was designed by Chicago architect August Maritzen in Second Empire style.  History Before becoming a hotel, Hotel Emma was an American brewery established in 1881 as the J.B. Behloradsky Brewery. In 1883, the San Antonio Brewing Association acquired the company. By 1916, Pearl was the largest brewery in Texas and the only brewery to survive Prohibition. In 2001, the brewery officially closed. In 2002, Silver Ventures, Inc. acquired the property. Hotel Emma is named after Emma Koehler, wife of Pearl President Otto Koehler. Following the death of her husband in 1914, Emma took over as Pearl's CEO. Emma kept the brewery doors open during Prohibition by expanding business lines to encompass auto repair, soft drinks, ice cream and dry cleaning. This prevented the brewery from closing, and saved hundreds of people from losing their jobs. Although she retired in 1933, Emma remained active behind the scenes in Pearl operations until her death in 1947.  Construction and design Construction of the hotel Construction for Hotel Emma began on December 10, 2012 with three architects and design firms secured: Three Living Architecture; Roman and Williams; and Powell & Carson Architects & Planners. Keeping much of the original architectural integrity and design, existing machinery and pieces were salvaged, as well as the original 134-foot brewery tower, resulting in a variety of different architectural styles. The Hotel Emma opened on November 12, 2015. The hotel includes more than 160,000 square feet of floor space, with 6,000 square feet of meeting and venue space. It also features cellar spaces for events, receptions and gatherings. The hotel has two towers; the original tower stands at 134 feet with eight floors, and the newly constructed tower stands 78 feet with six floors.  Features Library in Hotel Emma View of the lobby Throughout the planning, design and construction, architects and designers concentrated on preserving as much of the original structure and machinery as possible, integrating these components in the overall design.

Biography  Margottini was born in Rome in 1899, and attended the Italian Naval Academy from 1913 to 1916, graduating with the rank of Ensign. He participated in the First World War, first serving on the battleship Conte di Cavour, then on the scout cruiser Nibbio and on torpedo boats. In May 1917 he was promoted to Sub-Lieutenant and in November 1918 to Lieutenant, becoming aide to Admiral Enrico Millo, governor of Dalmatia. In 1927 he was promoted to Lieutenant Commander and in 1933 to Commander; he was given command of the Aegean Submarine Group and later of a torpedo boat squadron.Carlo Margottini on the website of Italian Navy In 1936 he participated in the London Naval Conference, as a military expert, on behalf of the Italian government. During the Spanish Civil War, in command of the heavy cruiser Fiume, he participated in the occupation of Ibiza and Mallorca and contributed to the political and military reorganization of Balearic Islands, being awarded the Knight's Cross of the Military Order of Savoy. On returning from the Spain, he was promoted to Captain and appointed Naval Attache in Paris. At the outbreak of World War II, Margottini was the commanding officer of the 11th Destroyer Squadron, with flag on the destroyer Artigliere. On 9 July 1940 he participated in the Battle of Calabria, where he led his Squadron in a gun and torpedo attack on the British fleet, receiving for this action the Bronze Medal of Military Valor. In the following months he carried out several missions from Messina and Augusta. On 11 October 1940, he took to the sea with the ships of his squadron to carry out a night search for a British naval force reported in the Sicilian Channel, in cooperation with ships of the 1st Torpedo Boat Squadron. In the night engagement that followed, the 1st Torpedo Boat Squadron and the 11th Destroyer Squadron attacked separately, one after another, the British light cruiser Ajax. The first attack was carried out by the torpedo boats, but was unsuccessful and resulted in the loss of the torpedo boats Airone and Ariel; shortly thereafter, the destroyers of the 11th Squadron attacked, but they found their enemy already on the alert. After sighting Ajax at 01:40, Artigliere attacked the opponent by launching a torpedo (which missed) and firing two 100 mm salvoes (that hit the cruiser, wrecking a 100 mm mount, the radar and the compass).October 12th, 1940World War II: The Definitive Encyclopedia and Document Collection Ajax quickly returned fire, however, and hit Artigliere several times within a few minutes, starting a large fire in the bow, knocking out most of the machinery and armament, and killing or wounding over half of the crew.

They are traditional Slavic festivals related to the period of carnival.  Sirni zagovezni in Bulgaria  Kukeri from Gorna Vasilitsa Sirni zagovezni (also called Sinitsi and Sirni pokladi) takes place seven weeks before Easter. The celebration takes place on Sunday, as that was the day of Christ's resurrection. Believers go to (Orthodox) Church early in the morning. Traditionally, the children ask for forgiveness from their parents, just as the parents ask the same of their grandparents. The youngest people ask for forgiveness from the oldest, then the elders ask for forgiveness from those who are younger. According to tradition, participants wear masks and celebrate the carnival at home. It symbolizes the victory of light over darkness (the coming of spring).  Kukeri  Kukeri (; singular: kuker, –∫—É–∫–µ—Ä) are elaborately costumed Bulgarian men who perform traditional rituals intended to scare away evil spirits. Closely related traditions are found throughout the Balkans and Greece (including Romania and the Pontus). The costumes cover most of the body and include decorated wooden masks of animals (sometimes double- faced) and large bells attached to the belt. Around New Year and before Lent, the kukeri walk and dance through villages to scare away evil spirits with their costumes and the sound of their bells. They are also believed to provide a good harvest, health, and happiness to the village during the year. Masopust in the Czech Republic Masopust in P≈ô√≠bram District. Czech Republic, 2009 Masopust or the time of carnivals used to be in the past the period from the Twelfth Night until Ash Wednesday. A Lenten period begins on Ash Wednesday before Easter. A fancy dress fun which is held as a rule on the Lenten Tuesday is the culmination of Masopust. The name carnival is a synonymous word to the name masopust, but currently the name masopust is used for marking the carnival festivity. Masopust and especially the few last days of this period (fa≈°ank, konƒçiny) was an official holiday of feasting for people in the past. During these days people were supposed to eat one‚Äôs fill, therefore, huge dinner parties were held. Then, the forty days long Lent followed and mostly lentils, baked potatoes, eggs, cheese, and boiled semolina were consumed. In some regions (Chodsko, Doudlebsko, Hlinecko etc.) a ceremonial procession of masks is a part of the festivity which goes through a village with music. In many places liquor, eggs, ham or doughnuts are collected and are consumed later on in a pub during a village party. In same processions a serious attention is given to a dance, mainly, to the ceremonial dances of young men who are called \\"bobkovn√≠ci\\" or \\"Turci\\". During the party other ceremonial dances are performed. These are called \\"na len\\" or \\"≈æabsk√°\\". In many other localities the festivity is made without these ceremonial components. There is only the presentation of masks left and it is a form of rural popular amusement which is connected with one particular date. The word fa≈°ank is created from mangling the German word Fasching which has got the same meaning. The word carnival comes from Roman languages, exactly from a connection of words carne (meat) and vale (leave). This word formation describes the situation when the meat is already eaten and there is nothing left.

Zapusty in Poland  Zapusty, Poland, 1950 The Polish carnival season includes Fat Thursday (Polish: T≈Çusty Czwartek), when pƒÖczki (doughnuts) are eaten, and ≈öledzik (Shrove Tuesday) or Herring Day. The Tuesday before the start of Lent is also often called Ostatki (literally \\"leftovers\\"), meaning the last day to party before the Lenten season. The traditional way to celebrate Zapusty is the kulig, a horse-drawn sleigh ride through the snow-covered countryside. In modern times, carnival is increasingly seen as an excuse for intensive partying and has become more commercialized, with stores offering carnival-season sales.  Maslenitsa in Russia and Ukraine  Fedot Sychkov. Plyaska (Russian folk dance). 1911 Maslenitsa is an Eastern Slavic religious and folk holiday, celebrated during the last week before Great Lent, that is, the eighth week before Eastern Orthodox Pascha (Easter). Maslenitsa corresponds to the Western Christian Carnival, except that Orthodox Lent begins on a Monday instead of a Wednesday, and the Orthodox date of Easter can differ greatly from the Western Christian date. According to archeological evidence from 2nd century A.D. Maslenitsa may be the oldest surviving Slavic holiday.Maslenitsa, Blin! The Food and Celebration of the Russians By Josh Wilson, Newsletter, The School of Russian and Asian Studies, 9 March 2005. Maslenitsa has its origins in the pagan tradition. In Slavic mythology, Maslenitsa is a sun-festival, personified by the ancient god Volos, and a celebration of the imminent end of the winter. In the Christian tradition, Maslenitsa is the last week before the onset of Great Lent.Maslenitsa by Margaret McKibben, Russian Folk Group of Seattle, WA, Seattle Community Network. undated. In some regions, each day of Maslenitsa had its traditional activity. Monday may be the welcoming of ‚ÄúLady Maslenitsa‚Äù. The community builds the Maslenitsa effigy out of straw (–∏–∑ —Å–æ–ª–æ–º—ã), decorated with pieces of rags, and fixed to a pole formerly known as Kostroma. It is paraded around and the first pancakes may be made and offered to the poor. On Tuesday, young men might search for a fianc√©e to marry after lent. On Wednesday sons-in-law may visit their mother-in-law who has prepared pancakes and invited other guests for a party. Thursday may be devoted to outdoor activities. People may take off work and spend the day sledding, ice skating, snowball fights and with sleigh rides. On Friday sons-in-law may invite their mothers-in-law for dinner. Saturday may be a gathering of a young wife with her sisters-in-law to work on a good relationship. The last day of Cheesefare Week is called \\"Forgiveness Sunday\\" (–ü—Ä–æ—â—ë–Ω–Ω–æ–µ –í–æ—Å–∫—Ä–µ—Å–µ–Ω—å–µ). Relatives and friends ask each other for forgiveness and might offer them small presents. As the culmination of the celebration people gather to \\"strip Lady Maslenitsa of her finery\\" and burn her in a bonfire. Left-over pancakes may also be thrown into the fire and Lady Maslenitsa's ashes are buried in the snow to \\"fertilize the crops\\".  Kurentovanje in Slovenia  Kurents in Ptuj today. Kurentovanje is one of Slovenia's most popular and ethnologically significant carnival events. This 10-day rite of spring and fertility is celebrated on Shrove Sunday in Ptuj, the oldest documented city in the region, and draws around 10,000 participants each year. Its main figure, known as Kurent or Korent, was seen as an extravagant god of unrestrained pleasure and hedonism in early Slavic customs. In today's festival, groups of kurents or kurenti wear traditional sheepskin garments while holding wooden clubs with hedgehog skins attached called je≈æevke, the noise of which is believed to \\"chase away winter\\". In this way, the presence of kurenti announces the end of winter and beginning of spring. Being a kurent was at first a privilege offered only to unmarried men, but today, married men, children and women are also invited to wear the outfit. In 2010, the 50th anniversary of the first organized instance of this festival was celebrated. As the host of the festival, the town of Ptuj was admitted into the European Federation of Carnival Cities in 1991.  Zvonƒçari in Croatia  Zvonejski zvonƒçar Zvonƒçari (the bellmen) is the characteristic folk custom maintained in the region around Rijeka, Croatia. It was added to UNESCO's Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2009. The custom dates to pagan antiquity, and remains typical for this region. The primary task of Zvonƒçari is to scare away evil spirits of winter and to stir up new spring-time cycle. During the Rijeka Carnival time Zvonƒçari march from village to village throughout the region, following the same centuries-old route, making an extraordinary amount of noise, fueled in part by the wine provided by the locals en route.

Mary Elizabeth Bass (April 5, 1876 ‚Äì January 26, 1956) was an American physician, educator and suffragist. She was the first of two women to become faculty members at the medical school of Tulane University along with Edith Ballard. Bass worked to promote the efforts of women as physicians. She worked at Tulane for thirty years.  Biography  Bass was born on April 5, 1876 in Marion County, Mississippi and was one of eight children. The family lost their property in the depression and they moved to Lumberton, Mississippi. Bass worked as an assistant teacher and attended Columbia High School, where she graduated in 1893. She also earned teaching certificates in both 1892 and 1896 from normal schools. She worked as a teacher for some time in the public schools of Mississippi and Texas. Bass' older brother, Charles, persuaded her and her sister, Cora, to become doctors sometime around 1899. However, schools in the southern United States wouldn't admit women into their medical programs at the time, so the sisters went north to attend school. Bass and her sister went to the Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania and they graduated in 1904. Charles Bass had a private practice in New Orleans and the sisters began their own private practice in the same city. Because the city hospitals of New Orleans wouldn't admit women physicians, Bass became a founder of a dispensary which would later become the New Orleans Hospital and Dispensary for Women and Children (now the Sara Mayo Hospital) in 1908. Bass became a member of the Era Club of New Orleans in 1905. The Era Club helped influence the decision to allow women to enroll in Tulane University as medical students in 1914. In 1911, Bass and another physician, Edith Ballard, became the first women faculty members of the Tulane University school of medicine. By 1913, she became a salaried faculty member as an instructor in the laboratory of clinical medicine. Also in 1913, Bass became the first women elected as an active member of the Orleans Parish Medical Society. In 1915, she joined the Women Physicians of the Southern Medical Association (WPSMA). By 1920, she was a full professor and during her career at Tulane taught pathology, clinical laboratory diagnosis, bacteriology and clinical medicine. She served as president of the Medical Women's National Association in 1921 and 1922. Bass retired from teaching in 1941. After retiring, she became the house physician at the Jung Hotel. She stopped practicing medicine in 1949 and spent time caring for her mother in Lumberton. Bass was honored the American Medical Women's Association with the Elizabeth Blackwell Centennial Medal Award in 1953. In 1956, Bass died of cancer at the Foundation Hospital in New Orleans and her body was buried in Lumberton.  Legacy  After Bass' death in 1956, friends at Tulane created the Elizabeth Bass Memorial Medical Student Loan Fund. Bass collected a large body of work by and about women in medicine. She also collected the manuscripts, papers, pictures, letters, press clippings and other ephemera created by women physicians. Bass wrote essays and histories based on her collection which now resides at the Matas Medical Library.

The film is part of the project Great Art Cinema and analyses one of the most mysterious works of Sandro Botticelli, the Map of Hell in the Divine Comedy Illustrated by Botticelli in the Vatican Library. The map was originally part of an illustrated manuscript of Dante's Divine Comedy, featuring artwork by Botticcelli. The film was edited in the facilities of TV Plus, Medea Film, and Nexo Digital. It attempts to shed light on Botticelli's motivation for drawing his Map of Hell, and, in the process, to reveal the dark, and less well known, side of the Renaissance master who is famous for painting The Birth of Venus and Primavera.  Plot  Botticelli had created 102 drawings based on the writings of Dante's Inferno depicting Dante's vision of Hell. One of those drawings, the Map of Hell, shows the suffering of the condemned souls at the various levels of Hell, is analysed by art experts and their conclusions are presented in the film. When the director of the film, Ralph Loop, saw Botticelli's exhibitions in Berlin and London in 2015, he became so fascinated with the Map of Hell that he decided to make a film about it. In Ron Howard's Inferno, the Map of Hell is shown briefly as a projection on a wall, while Ralph Loop's film is dedicated to examining the map and its history in detail. The film attempts to shed light on what motivated Botticelli to draw the Map of Hell, and, in doing so, to reveal the dark, and less well known, side of the Renaissance master who is famous for painting The Birth of Venus and Primavera. The drawing is about 30 by 40 centimetres and in the film it is examined by a glove-wearing German art historian inside the air-conditioned vaults of the Vatican. A letter from Friedrich Lippmann, director of Kupferstichkabinett Berlin, who in 1882 brought 85 of Botticelli's 102 drawings to the museum, is also shown in the film. A high-performance digital scanner is used in the film to reveal details in the map which could not be discerned by the human eye.  Locales  The film was shot on location in the Vatican, the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, the Vatican Library, London, Berlin and Scotland.  Reception  The Map of Hell painting by Botticelli is the subject of the film. Die Zeit comments that the film is worth seeing \\"as a background for the blockbuster [Ron Howard's film] ‚Äì or instead.\\" and further comments that Ron Howard's film only briefly shows a projection of the map, while in Ralph Loop's film the viewer can \\"marvel at the miracle in detail\\". The reviewer further asks \\"A whole film about a darkly colored drawing of just 30 by 40 centimeters, centuries old ‚Äì is not that terribly dry?\\" concluding that \\"In fact, the small film is not meant to provide new insights to art scientists. But it entertains us non-experts in the best possible [way] with the little material that can be filmed in this subject so we see shots of Florence and Rome...\\". Die Zeit finally concludes, \\"Anyone who can free himself from such perfectly overworked vision of hell, recognizes Botticelli's painting [for] what it still is: infernal[ly] good.\\" Spielfilm.de comments that the film will be interesting to \\"[a]lmost anyone who has a passion for exciting thriller costumes or unsolved secrets (the history of art and culture)\\". The critic further comments \\"[o]n the one hand, [Loop] provides a comprehensive insight into the time of Botticelli ‚Äì at all times, friendly, and comprehensible. And also for cinema-goers, to whom Botticelli and his art so far were largely foreign.\\" Concerning the technology employed to scan the map details, the reviewer remarks that \\"[f]or the documentary \\"Botticelli Inferno\\", the [map] was illuminated with a high-performance scanner. This makes shading, coloring, details and hidden messages visible in an unprecedented way. Things that hitherto remained hidden from the eye.\\" The review also mentions that the film employs a first-person narration technique, when referring to Botticelli, that makes the viewer feel close to the artist. The critic goes on to conclude that the film is: \\"a masterly, artfully documented work of art, [about] one of the most mysterious works of art in history.\\" AlloCin√© comments that \\"Botticelli ‚Äì Inferno transports viewers into another world: a journey to the underworld through the nine levels of hell, as described by Dante. \\"Only by traveling through hell and purgatory we can reach paradise and emerge to see the stars again\\" Do not miss this unique event, specially created for cinema.\\"  Release  The film was released in Italy in November 2016.

Medellin once had a standard steel wheeled tramway network. Like most cities in the world, it first was started as horse tram, and finally electric tram. The tram service was completely stopped in 1951. Trams returned to Medellin in 2015. History Old tramcar has been plinthed A horse tramway was opened at Medellin in 1887. Horse-drawn trams began carrying passengers along Carrera 52, between Plazuela de la Veracruz (near Parque Berr√≠o) and El Ed√©n, on 23 January 1887. It was short lived, and ultimately closed in 1897.and later the it was planned for electrification. The Americans started electrification in 24 June 1920, and finally electric tramway opened in 12 October 1921. From Parque Berr√≠o to Am√©rica opened to traffic. Track gauge of the electric tramway was 914 mm / 36 in, the same used by the steam railroads. Routes were gradually constructed towards Sucre, Buenos Aires, Envigado, Belen, Berlin, Arenjue Hill etc. The entire network was single tracked (with some crossing loops), cars were single coach. In 1945 the network reached its maximum extent with 45 Kilometers of tracks with 61 trams. Decline started after the 2nd World War. Damage and traffic congestion also grew rapidly. Starting of bus & taxi service grew very rapidly. The number of private cars also increased very much, and especially many streets, which were ideal for tram, now started becoming congested by motor vehicles. Tramcars were not modernized for many decades, and basically the 1930s electric cars were still running in the 1950s. In that time gasoline buses started faster & had smoother journeys with modern buses, whereas trams were still slower, single coach and many backdated features like trolley pole etc., so they looked very outdated. Under maintenance of tracks caused some derailments and bumpy rides, which were not liked by commuters. A network of single-track lines with turn-outs was no longer adequate for a rapidly growing city, and for this program, many streets were necessary for widening. The transport authority thought that a slow tram transport with fast bus transport will cause many problems for smoother city transportation, although the tram tracks were on the side of the streets, but they were not interested to double the tracks. The tramway had little comfort and was slow because it was caught in the traffic jam caused by the cars, buses etc. The tracks were also outdated and noisy. Another main problem was the city was not built on plains, and had an steep grade on their main streets, which was a problem for old steel wheeled trams, where increasing of speed was not possible. Despite this, routes which were on reserved track and steep grade were survived, and all routes which were on unreserved street section and plain lands were closed. By justifying all ways, the transport department decided to close the tram network and replace it with trolleybus service. The last tram ran on 7 October 1951. Trolleybus service was even started before closure of the tram network. Tranv√≠a Municipal de Medell√≠n purchased two trolleybuses from Ransomes, Sims & Jefferies in England in 1928 and opened a line to Los √Ångeles on 12 October 1929. It later bought more trolleybuses, built its own trolleybuses, and opened a second line to La Toma in 1934. After closing the tram network in the early '50s, the people of Medellin thought the only unfashionable obstacle of smooth city traveling has been removed, and the city could move faster than before, but it proved false some years later. Uncontrolled increasing of petrol vehicles like buses, taxis, and private cars started choking the streets of Medellin. Like most South American countries, Colombia suffered many problems of developing countries, including pollution, traffic jams, illegal migration, low literacy and booming increasing of population etc. Increase in population started increasing urbanization of Medellin, and it started increasing motor vehicles, which started increasing air & sound pollution, traffic jams & smog. Starting at the early '60s, all these problems were present and at the mid '90s, inhabitants of Medellin finally realized that non-controlling of motor vehicles & closure of the tram was a great mistake. Although trolleybus is also a pollution free transportation, maintenance of that system was even higher than tram, because, it ran on rubber tires, which damages faster than iron wheels. A metro system opened in 1995, using a small part of the former tram network, and gradually two metro routes were constructed. But for low density area, this was not an ideal solution, so metro was not extended throughout Medellin. Many cities around the world like Tunis, Algiers, Sydney, Buenos Aires, Shanghai, Shenyang, Tianjin, Dublin, Edinburgh, Athens, Bergen, etc. also understood that error, and like them Medellin also planned for the return of tram. Downtown Medellin was already served by metro, but the transportation in eastern Medellin was not sufficient. So the transport authority decided to construct it around Miraflores area in 2015, which is in the eastern side of the main city. Timeline *1887 - Horse tram started on 23 January. *1921 - Electric tram started running from 12 October. *1945 - Seventeen routes opened as a maximum extension of the tram network. *1951 - The last tram ran on 7 October. *2015 - Tram returned as a modern system. Tram routes Fleet All tramcars were single coach and bi directional, drawing electricity by trolley-pole. Twelve 2-axle \\"Birney Safety Cars\\" from J. G. Brill Co. in Philadelphia started electric tram operation, TMM built 10 more tram routes and purchased 52 more Birney cars from Brill in the 1920s: 6 in 1923, 7 in 1924, 2 in 1925, 9 in 1926, 14 in 1927 and 14 in 1928. Six of the cars purchased in 1928 were large 4-axle models. However, after that the tramway had very little upgrade and basically the 1930s electric cars were still running in the 1950s. These vehicles looked outdated compared to the new cars and buses that were then on the streets. That was one of the strong reasons of the closure of the system. Depots & termini Berlin, Campo Verdes, Robledo, Estaci√≥n Villa, Sucre, San Javier, Salvador, Gerona, Buenos Aires, Belen, and Envigado were some of the termini. The tram depot was on Calle 50. Alignment Most tram routes were on unreserved tracks and on the side of roads. The route towards Envigado and Berlin was almost completely on reserved track, so it offered high speed service. Tramcars were caught in the traffic jams caused by the cars, and single track was the main obstacle for a hassle free service. The tracks were also outdated, noisy and not maintained properly. Those were some other strong reasons of the closure of the system. See also Ayacucho Tram - The second generation modern tram in Medellin that was opened in 2016.

She won NPR's 2016 Tiny Desk Contest. Early life Gaelynn Lea was born with osteogenesis imperfecta, a genetic condition that causes complications in the development of bones and limbs. Lea became impassioned by classical music from an early age, and in fifth grade a teacher took notice and encouraged Lea to pursue music after she had the class's only perfect score on a music listening test. Lea developed a technique for violin which involved holding the bow \\"like a baseball bat\\" with the body of the instrument placed in front of her, like a cello, and attached to her foot so it wouldn't slip when she played. Lea attended Macalester College, where she majored in political science; prior to her music career, she had planned to pursue a career as a lawyer and disability rights advocate.  Musical career  Lea's early career collaborations included the alternative folk music duo The Murder of Crows with Alan Sparhawk, an \\"atmospheric, improvisational project\\" they began in 2011. Lea has also played with Charlie Parr and Billy McLaughlin. Lea gained exposure after winning NPR's 2016 Tiny Desk Contest. Her song and performance for \\"Someday We'll Linger in the Sun\\" was selected over six thousand other submissions by a committee that included Dan Auerbach of the Black Keys, Jess Wolfe of Lucius, Son Lux and NPR staff. Auerbach's citation read: \\"This song starts off with the sound of 20 old floorboards groaning and creaking in unison and then Karen Dalton and Joanna Newsom melt together in the form of Gaelynn Lea and set about absolutely obliterating your heart.\\" Style and influence Lea possesses a mezzo-soprano voice, which has been characterized by Denny Dyroff of the Unionville Times as \\"ethereal\\". Lea's style is rooted in classical, Celtic and traditional folk music. With the use of looping pedals Lea layers multiple orchestrated parts from a miked violin while she sings. Due to her physical stature she plays violin in the style of a cellist, which creates a unique sound: in this stance, her bow strikes the lower strings first (as they do on a cello), in contrast to most violinists for whom the bow strikes the highest string first. Reviewing her performance at the 2017 Folk Alliance Conference for Paste Magazine, Geoffrey Himes described Lea's \\"Watch the World Unfold\\" as the \\"most moving song\\" he heard at the conference: \\"The song draws its power from the tension between a young person‚Äôs optimistic plans and the obstacles that life throws in the way of those hopes, a conflict reinforced by the paradox of the sunny, childlike vocal melody and the cloudy, ominous swirl of violin harmony.\\" Writing for The Kansas City Star, Bill Brownlee contrasted Lea's musical style with what Brownlee called the \\"fussy forms of indie-rock\\" often praised by NPR All Songs Considered's hosts, Bob Boilen and Robin Hilton: \\"Many listeners who object to the tastemakers‚Äô genteel predilections forgave the men after they discovered plaintive folk artist Gaelynn Lea last year...Filmed on a friend's iPhone, the video of Lea's rendition of her memorable original song 'Someday We'll Linger in the Sun' captures her otherworldly voice and ethereal fiddle playing.\\" Advocacy Lea was a guest speaker at Yale University for a TedxTalk to discuss sexuality, the obstacles for people with disabilities, and the use of art as a vessel to overcome physical limitations. She also speaks on accessibility in the music industry.  Personal life  Around 2014 Lea married Paul Tressler, with whom she had been in a relationship since around 2007. Tressler acts as Lea's tour manager.

History The idea for SiteW (pronounced Site Double-V√©) was born in the Spring of 2007 when Fabien Versange and C√©dric Hamel, two computer scientists with a shared passion for web technologies, were approached by several local business in the Auvergne region, such as associations, small hotels, shopkeepers and artisans to design their websites. These people had a limited budget and were unable to call on specialized companies for these services, while also lacking the technical knowledge to create websites on their own. This common demand inspired the two to form a company around the central idea to make the design of a website faster, easier and more accessible to common individuals and professionals in an effort to try and make the internet more democratic with the help of SiteW's website creation tool. Hailing from Cantal, in the central region of France, the company was registered at the Chamber of Commerce of Aurillac in January 2008, where they opened their offices in nearby Calvinet before relocating to Cassaniouze after three years, launching their website and online web services a Month later. Business picked up quickly with hundreds of users signing up within the first couple of Months and the first companies outside of France making use of the service by September of the same year. By December 2010 the company had successfully registered and created 150,000 websites. In 2011 the German version of the website was released. On 26 June 2012 another milestone was reached with 500,000 websites created and launched using the SiteW tools with 15% of the customer base coming from abroad. In September 2014 the company had managed to help create 1 million websites. That same year the company upgraded all their website building tools. Functionality The company offers a web based service, using the SaaS model, making the platform easy to access without having to download any applications. The tools are simplified and easy to understand, using a simple drag-and-drop methodology for creating a website. The websites that are created are then hosted on a secured server using cloud technology that can be accessed from around the World.

Jeff Calder is a founding member of the notable American new-wave band The Swimming Pool Q's. Lisa King previously played with 1990's Alt-Rock band Unminded, (guitar, vocals), and in the 2000s she played with celebrated Atlanta bands The Swimming Pool Q's (keyboards, percussion) and The Glenn Phillips Band (keyboards), featuring influential guitar soloist and composer Glenn Phillips. Mike Lynn, founding member of 1990's Atlanta college-rock band Betty's Not A Vitamin, joined the lineup in 2012 on rhythm guitar. Robert Schmid, the former drummer and current bassist for The Swimming Pool Q's rounded out the lineup on drums in 2013. Richard Lloyd of Television and David J Haskins of Bauhaus/Love and Rockets have been guest musicians on recent recordings by The Hot Place. The Hot Place recorded their first album, The Language of Birds at Southern Tracks Recording, the now-retired historic Atlanta analog studio, whose prominent clients included Bruce Springsteen, Matthew Sweet, Stone Temple Pilots, and Bob Dylan. The record was produced by Jeff Calder of The Swimming Pool Q's. Guest guitarist Richard Lloyd, founding member of the 1970s proto-punk band Television, played the guitar solo on two tracks from the album, Saturn Moved and Petals of Ruin (reprise). The album was released digitally in 2014 and on 180 gram orange vinyl in 2015 on the independent Atlanta label, No Big Wheel Records, after a successful Kickstarter campaign. The band's first single, Petals of Ruin was released digitally in 2013 in conjunction with World Goth Day, which is an annual yearly celebration every May 22, promoting tolerance of alternative subcultures.

They are a common menu item at fast food restaurants, and other restaurants also purvey them. Combination meals may be priced lower compared to ordering items separately, but this is not always the case. A combination meal is also a meal in which the consumer orders items √† la carte to create their own meal combination. The casada is a common type of lunch combination meal in Costa Rica and Panama. Overview Fast food combination meals typically include a main item (French: entr√©e) such as a hamburger, a side dish such as fries, and a beverage such as a soft drink. Other types of restaurants, such as fast-casual restaurants also offer combination meals. Combination meals may be priced lower compared to ordering the items separately, and this lower pricing may serve to entice consumers that are budget-minded. A 2010 study published in the Journal of Public Policy & Marketing found that some consumers may order a combination meal even if no price discount is applied compared to the price of ordering items separately. The study found that this behavior is based upon consumers perceiving an inherent value in combination meals, and also suggested that the ease and convenience of ordering, such as ordering a meal by number, plays a role compared to ordering items separately. This study also found that the presence of combination meals encourages consumers to increase meal portion size by supersizing their meals. A combination meal can also comprise a meal in which separate dishes are selected by consumers from an entire menu, and can include √† la carte selections that are combined on a plate. A fast food combination meal can contain over . Fast food restaurants sometimes offer a means to order larger portions of food within the format of the combination meal, such as supersizing. History In the United States in the early 1930s, the combination meal was a popular dish in restaurants and in homes. In Latin America In Costa Rican and Panamanian cuisine, a combination meal is referred to as a casado, which means \\"married\\". It is a typical lunch dish in both countries. In Costa Rica, a casado typically consists of a meat dish, rice and beans, and deli salads. Additional foods comprising the Costa Rican casado can include fried plantain, noodles and tomatoes. In Costa Rica, the term plato del d√≠a (plate of the day) is frequently used interchangeably with the term casado. In Panama, a casado typically consists of an entree, rice and beans, and cabbage. In Panama, the plato executive, which means \\"executive plate\\", is a prix fixe (fixed price) lunch menu offered in some upscale restaurants that is similar in concept to the casado. In Spain The Spanish version of the combination meal, known as plato combinado, is a staple in bars and restaurants across the country. These meals are popular as they are affordable and can be quickly cooked to order. They often consist of a main (meat, e.g. grilled steak, hamburgers or breaded cutlets; seafood, e.g. fried calamari or grilled squid; fish, battered or grilled; or other fried foods, such as croquettes), a side dish of salad or French fries (in some cases, mixed vegetables or peas), and a fried egg. The meals date back to the Spanish Civil War. During that period, the Francoist dictatorship introduced a single- dish day (D√≠a del Plato √önico), which initially took place every fortnight and then each Friday, in order to support the war effort. However, most upscale restaurants circumvented the rule by increasing serving sizes or using ingredients in short supply, such as seafood, fish or fresh eggs. In its current iteration, the plato combinado was designed to cater to the increasing number of tourists during the Spanish miracle. To do so, the meals and their prices were normalised; in this way, the offerings would be consistent across the country. As the meal sets were not popular with tourists, the government began to promote them amongst the local population, where they were well received. This could be explained by their association with American-style diners, which were fashionable in the 1950s and 1960s. Despite their popularity, the plato combinado is often seen as unhealthy and outdated. This is due to the cooking techniques used, as many of the products are deep-fried. In addition, many of the products used tend to be lacking in quality, as they are mostly frozen. In this sense, the fare is similar to that served in caf√©s or greasy spoons in the United States and the United Kingdom.

His masterpiece is Holy Cross Minster, an influential milestone of late Gothic architecture in the town of Schw√§bisch Gm√ºnd, Baden-W√ºrttemberg, Germany. Parler also founded the Parler family of master builders and his descendants worked in various parts of central Europe, especially Bohemia. His son, Peter Parler, became one of the major architects of the Middle Ages. The family name is derived from the word Parlier, meaning \\"foreman\\".Campbell, p 31.  Life and work  Nave of Holy Cross Minster Choir of Holy Cross Minster, showing \\"Parler style\\" sculptural details depicting the Old Testament Heinrich Parler was probably born in Cologne between 1300 and 1310, where his earliest known work was supervising the construction of Cologne Cathedral.Kleiner, p 408. He later lived and worked in Gm√ºnd, an Imperial City () of the Holy Roman Empire.Harvey, p. 112. Sometime around 1333, Parler was invited to become construction manager of the Holy Cross Minster () in Gm√ºnd.Klemm, p. 177. Construction had already begun in 1315 to replace an existing Romanesque church with a Gothic basilica form. He amended the plan of this new building and completed the nave as a hall church (), the first of its kind in southern Germany.McLachlan, p. 264 Rounded pillars with leaf wreath capitals, elongated tracery windows, and complex colored vaults are the first tangible evidence of his new style, which became even more pronounced with the laying of the foundation stone of the choir in 1351. His son Peter Parler (1333‚Äì1399) began working alongside him on the choir, designed as an ambulatory with chapels lying flat between the buttresses. The number of required internal support columns was therefore reduced and the aisles were built as tall as the nave, creating an expanded sense of space.Kleiner, p 408. Heinrich Parler was also responsible for experimental, more lifelike sculptures than had hitherto been created in previous churches.McLachlan, p. 264 Holy Cross therefore marks an important milestone in late Gothic architecture and sculpture.Pinkus, p. 122 Father and son did not live to see the consecration of the church, which took place in 1410. Work continued into the 16th century.Schock-Werner, p. 70. As was customary, Heinrich the Elder was also responsible for other construction sites in addition to Schw√§bisch Gm√ºnd. Although undocumented, he most likely designed the Frauenkirche, Nuremberg working with his son Peter. The relationship between the design of the church is strikingly close to the prototype of Holy Cross Minster. This comparison also applies to the choir of Augsburg Cathedral, begun in 1356.Schurr, Mark Carel (2006). Die Erneuerung des Augsburger Domes im 14. Jahrhundert und die Parler. In: Kaufhold, Martin (ed): Der Augsburger Dom im Mittelalter, Augsburg, pp. 49‚Äì59; He may also have had a hand in the design of Ulm Minster, begun in 1366 and today the tallest church in the world,Oggins, p 82. although his family members are more clearly documented as carrying forward the work.Schock-Werner, p. 70.  Legacy  Heinrich Parler's architectural style and contemporary sculptural designs were taken up by many other masons and further developed, ranking him as one of the most influential craftsman of the 14th century.Schock-Werner, p. 71. What became known as the \\"Parler style\\" spread across central Europe and can be seen at St. Martin's Church, Landshut; St. Lorenz, Nuremberg; St. George's Minster, Dinkelsb√ºhl; St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna; and numerous examples throughout the Hanseatic League from the Netherlands to Poland. Examples can also be found in Scandinavia, such as at St. Mary's, Helsing√∏r, Denmark.Yarwood, p. 92. Heinrich Parler's son, Peter Parler, became one of the greatest architects of the Gothic era.Bork, p. 201. Heinrich's eldest son, Johann Parler the Elder, worked as a builder in Zwettl and then at Basel Cathedral. Heinrich could have had a brother, the foreman Peter von Reutlingen, who presumably built the Marienkirche and the Nikolaikirche in Reutlingen, Germany.Klemm, p. 178  Notes   References    * Further reading Lange, Joseph (1980). \\"Die Quirinusskulptur von Heinrich Parler am Petersportal des K√∂lner Domes.\\" Neusser Jahrbuch f√ºr Kunst, Kulturgeschichte und Heimatkunde (in German). 1980, pp. 31‚Äì36. * Hlobil, Ivo (1997). \\"Heinrich IV.

It is located opposite the Blackwater Valley Path. It is split into two parts: Watchmoor Park business park and Watchmoor Point industrial estate are accessed via Riverside Way, whilst the Sainsbury's Watchmoor Park Superstore and the Watchmoor Reserve nature area are accessed via a completely separate road mainly hidden from public view by trees, shrubs and hedges. The two sections are only connected via a pedestrian footpath. Watchmoor Park business park Watchmoor Park business park was developed in the late 1980s and the early 1990s by the asset management company London and Metropolitan. The site covers 45 acres and has large open spaces and lakes. It consists of 255,000 sq ft of office space spread between six self contained office buildings along with a separate business centre for small office users. It is home to the offices of several large companies including Telent, Jaegermeister, BTG, Unisys, Novartis, Bachy Soletanche, Dc Leisure and Herrington & Carmichael. In September 2017 Frasers Property purchased Watchmoor Park business park from Oaktree Capital Management for ¬£42 million. It is managed by the property management company MAPP. Watchmoor Point industrial estate Watchmoor Point industrial estate is located adjacent to the Watchmoor Park business park on Watchmoor Rad accessed via Riverside Way. Sainsbury's Watchmoor Park Superstore In 1987 J Sainsbury plc and London and Metropolitan Estates Ltd planned a 37,000 sq ft Sainsbury's supermarket and an adjacent Homebase store with 650 car parking spaces on the part of the Watchmoor Park site which used to be a household rubbish tip. However, the Homebase plan was later abandoned, which was opened in 1990 off The Meadows roundabout instead (the Homebase store has since been closed and replaced by a Next store). In the end, a 36,000 sq ft Sainsbury's supermarket with 751 car parking spaces was opened on 23 June 1992 by the then Chairman Lord (John) Sainsbury himself. The store was almost doubled in size to 66,910 sq ft in 2004. This consisted of a front and side extension. The side extension was built out of the same materials as the existing store, but was built over part of the original service yard. This means that delivery lorries now have to use the customer recycling point as the turning circle area, rather than turning in the main service yard. This side extension now contains the Argos in-store concession, which was opened in 2017. The large front extension covering the full width of the original store has a very different fa√ßade to the original building, being more contemporary white panels instead of traditional light red bricks. As a result of this extension, 178 parking spaces were lost leaving a remaining 573 car parking spaces. This extension houses the checkouts and various other third party in-store concessions comprising Starbucks, Timpson, Explore Learning and Centre for Dentistry. Lloyds Pharmacy and Sushi Gourmet also have concessions inside the store. There is a petrol filling station at the far end of the site. In 2013, Sainsbury's tried to demolish its store and re-build it to over 100,000 sq ft to better compete with the Tesco Extra in The Meadows, but this application was unsuccessful. Watchmoor Reserve Watchmoor Reserve As part of the Sainsbury's development, a 13-acre nature area, Watchmoor Reserve, was created. It is owned by Surrey Heath Borough Council. Built on the site of scrubland, it was opened in Autumn 1992 and houses an outdoor classroom for children, trees, sculptures, a butterfly habitat area, a turfed viewing mound, three ponds and a 70x30 metre lake with reed beds and its own bird sanctuary island. It is located at the far end of the Sainsbury's site behind the petrol filling station and has a small car park consisting of around 13 car parking spaces. Transport Footbridge connecting the Blackwater Valley Path with the junction at the entrance to Watchmoor Park business park Watchmoor is located half a mile from Junction 4 of the M3 motorway. In 2017 a footpath and cycleway was built between Blackwater railway station and the Sainsbury's supermarket running along the A331 Blackwater Valley Road. There is also an alternative pedestrian route to the area from Blackwater railway station via the Blackwater Valley Path, going across the bridge over the Blackwater River which was constructed in 2008 to the Hawley Meadows Car Park, at the junction at the entrance to Riverside Way which was also constructed in 2017. There is an infrequent bus route to the Sainsbury's store from Camberley town centre subsidised by Sainsbury's itself as a condition for the approval of the 2004 extension to its supermarket. However, there is no bus route to Riverside Way, the entrance to the Watchmoor Park business park and Watchmoor Point industrial estate.

The focus of this district is a cluster of brick buildings around the intersection of Washington and East 22nd Streets on the north side of Dubuque. Its location west of the former Chicago Great Western Railway and the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad yards led to a large percentage of the residents here to be higher ranking railroad employees. The historic buildings are brick and frame houses, with the exception of one brick storefront/residence. Most of the houses are front or side gabled vernacular structures, and a few that are Italianate or Classical Revival. Couler Creek, which was located behind the houses on the east side of Washington Street, also affected the development of this area. There is no alley behind the houses on the east side of Washington.

Although a member of the Nazi Party, she tried to defend fellow-artists against charges of degeneracy, though usually without success.  Biography  She was born to a peasant farming family and initially worked as a cowherd. Her first paintings were made at that time, featuring animals and shepherds, with brushes made from animal hair and colors from berries. In 1904, she was admitted to the K√∂nigliche Kunstgewerbeschule in Munich, on the strength of the drawings she presented as samples.Brief biography @ Sammlung Stephanie Hollenstein. After completing the courses there in 1908, she opened a small painting school in Schwabing, which was in operation for two years. In 1913, upon the recommendation of Franz von Defregger, she was awarded a scholarship that enabled her to study for a year in Italy.\\"Stephanie Hollenstein\\" by Brynhild Amann @ Neue Ordnung.

Although her comrades-in- arms were aware of the deception, her superiors did not discover it for several months; at which time she was sent home. This incident attracted public attention, however, and she was assigned as a war painter for the \\"\\" (War Press Bureau). In that capacity, she was sent to the front on three occasions and, in 1916, was among the first recipients of the Karl Troop Cross. She later received numerous commissions from the Museum of Military History. Portrait of Dr. Franziska Gro√ü After the war, she lived in Vienna with her companion, Franziska Gro√ü (1900-1973), who later became a doctor, and held several exhibitions with the K√ºnstlerhaus Wien, the Vienna Secession and the Hagenbund. Her activities were interrupted for a time in 1928, following an accident that resulted in a double ankle fracture, but she was able to get treatment from Lorenz B√∂hler, a doctor who is credited with establishing the field of accident surgery. She recovered completely and made extensive travels through Germany and Italy. Nazi years In the 1930s, she was attracted to the \\"M√§nnlichkeitskult\\" (Masculinity Cult) and the military ideals promoted by the Fascists. She became a secret member of the Nazi Party (when it was still officially banned in Austria), then rejoined openly after the Anschluss. From that time until 1943, she was chairperson of the \\"Vereinigung Bildender K√ºnstlerinnen der Reichsgaue der Ostmark\\" (Association of Women Artists of the Reichsgau of Austria). During her tenure, she defended the sculptor, , and others against charges that their art was \\"Degenerate\\"; unsuccessfully for the most part. An application for the title of \\"Professor\\" was denied on the grounds that she was a strictly local artist whose work often did not set a good example.

It consists of chopped codfish, tomatoes and chilies. The name is of French origin. 18th century colonial power Spain launched the c√©dula de poblaci√≥n in 1783, an edict that successfully promoted the settling of French (i.e. likewise Catholic) planters in Trinidad who quickly set the population majority. The name is a combination of the French words brul√© (burnt) and gueule (muzzle), which was changed into \\"bu'n jaw\\" in Trinidad's 19th century patois and finally morphed into \\"buljol\\". The name does not relate to the temperature of the dish (it's served cold) but to its hotness, caused by the added hot pepper. In colonial times buljol was considered a poor man's food, but nowadays it is used as a breakfast ingredient, being eaten with toast or fried bake. From Trinidad the use of buljol has spread to other Caribbean islands (especially Barbados) and Trinidadian communities in English-speaking countries such as Canada, Great Britain and the United States. Skin and fishbones of the salty codfish are removed, then it is cooked or repeatedly soused with cooking water to remove as much of the salt as possible. The fish is then shredded and mixed with chopped tomatoes and chilies. Additional ingredients are added to taste with onions, bell peppers and olive oil being prevalent, but also garlic, hard-boiled eggs, lemon juice, lettuce, white wine and various herbs are used. Instead of codfish sometimes pollock or hake are used.

The intervention was launched to resolve a breakdown of internal order in the government of the Gambia that resulted from a dispute over the country's presidency. The dispute had led to a constitutional crisis in the country. The intervention began in January 2017, and in June 2017, the term of the ECOWAS military mission was extended by a year. The mission is ongoing as of August 2020, and is expected to continue through at least 2021. The brief period of open conflict at the beginning of the mission was precipitated by the refusal to step down from power of Yahya Jammeh, the long-standing President of the Gambia, after he disputed the victory of Adama Barrow in the 2016 presidential election. As a result of the intervention, Jammeh was forced to step down and go into exile two days after the initial military incursion. Following his departure, 4,000 ECOWAS troops remained in the Gambia to maintain order in preparation for Barrow to return and consolidate his presidency. Five days later, Barrow returned to the Gambia while requesting the ECOWAS troops (now numbering about 2,500) to stay for at least six months to help him firmly establish order. Although there were a few reports of isolated minor clashes during the first few hours of the military incursion, there were no reports of casualties in the initial conflict. In the following months, two people have been reported killed and about ten injured in incidents surrounding protests against the continued military presence in the community. Intervention Some 45,000 refugees fled across the border into Senegal after Jammeh's refusal to step down on 18 January. The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) decided to intervene militarily in the Gambian constitutional crisis that occurred as a result of Gambian President Yahya Jammeh refusing to step down after losing the December 2016 presidential election, and set 19 January 2017 as the date the troops would move into the Gambia if Jammeh continued to refuse to step down. The operation was codenamed \\"Operation Restore Democracy\\". ECOWAS forces were amassed around the borders of the Gambia, and Marcel Alain de Souza, the president of ECOWAS, said, \\"By land, sea and air, Gambia is surrounded. A total of 7,000 men will participate in the mission to re-establish democracy in Gambia.\\" In contrast, the entire armed forces of the Gambia numbered only about 2,500 troops. On 19 January, Adama Barrow, who had been staying in Senegal due to fear for his safety in the Gambia, was sworn in as President in the Gambian embassy in Dakar, Senegal. Just after Barrow was sworn in, the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) unanimously approved UNSC Resolution 2337 on the same day, which expressed support for ECOWAS efforts to negotiate the transition of the presidency, but requested the use of \\"political means first\\" without endorsing military action. Despite the lack of endorsement of military action by the UNSC, Senegalese armed forces entered the Gambia on the same day, along with some forces from Ghana, with air and sea support from the Air Force and Navy of Nigeria. Gambia was placed under a naval blockade. In the early hours of the offensive, clashes took place near the border village of Kanilai, the home town of Yahya Jammeh, between Senegalese and pro-Jammeh MFDC forces, and Senegal reportedly took control of the village. Senegal halted its offensive in order to provide a final chance to mediate the crisis, with the invasion planned to proceed at noon on 20 January if Jammeh still refused to relinquish power. According to a statement given by the United Nations Refugee Agency on 20 January based on estimates provided by the government of Senegal, around 45,000 people had been displaced and had fled to Senegal, and at least 800 more people had fled to Guinea-Bissau. More than 75% of the displaced people arriving in Senegal were children, with the remainder being mostly women. Jammeh, however, refused to step down even after the deadline passed. The deadline was extended to 16:00 GMT which too he missed. Mauritania's President Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz, President of Guinea Alpha Cond√© and United Nations' regional chief Mohammed Ibn Chambas tried to persuade him to step down. Gambia's army chief General Ousman Badjie meanwhile pledged allegiance to Barrow and stated that the Gambian Army would not fight ECOWAS. Barrow and a Senegalese official later stated that Jammeh had agreed to step down. Diplomats meanwhile stated that Senegalese troops would remain deployed at the border in case he reneged on the deal. A deal was later announced for him to leave the country for exile, and a short time later he announced on state television that he was stepping down. Stabilisation After Jammeh went into exile on 21 January (initially going to Guinea and then to Equatorial Guinea), ECOWAS announced that about 4,000 of its troops would remain stationed in the country for ensuring security. On 26 January 2017, Barrow returned to the Gambia, while about 2,500 ECOWAS troops remained in the country to stabilise it. He requested the troops to remain in the country for an additional six months. The troops remained in Banjul, and at important locations such as the port and airport as well as at the main crossing points to Senegal. On 8 February 2017, the Gambian presidential office announced that the mandate of the mission would be extended by three more months. President of Ghana Nana Akufo-Addo stated in mid-February that the number of Ghanaian soldiers deployed for stabilisation of Gambia will be downsized to 50. On 21 April 2017, ECOWAS forces clashed with Gambian soldiers loyal to former leader Yahya Jammeh, shooting and injuring three who were guarding graves at his home. A Gambia Armed Forces spokesman said there was a misunderstanding and an investigation is in progress. One civilian was declared by Gambian government to have been killed in Kanilai in a protest against ECOWAS forces while a civilian and an ECOMIG officer was declared to be injured on 2 June, with 22 arrests made. On 2 June 2017, one protester was shot dead and nine were wounded by Senegalese soldiers in Kanilai after soldiers opened fire on protesters in what they claim as \\"self-defense\\" during a protest in which thousands participated against the heavy military presence in their community. The term of the ECOWAS military mission was extended by a year on 5 June. ECOWAS and African Union forces were still providing security services in the country in April 2020 while local forces were being trained and readied. Despite polls showing over 50% of the Gambian public want them to leave, president Adama Barrow has asked for an extension of the mission through 2021. Participating forces The intervention force was composed of Senegalese, Ghanaian, Malian, Togolese and Nigerian forces. Nigeria provided aircraft and naval assets. The Gambian army chief declared that the army would not involve itself in a political dispute, while the navy chose to declare its support for Barrow. However, some paramilitaries and mercenaries stayed loyal to Jammeh. The Senegalese rebel group Movement of Democratic Forces of Casamance reportedly joined pro-Jammeh forces and there were reported clashes on the border with Senegal. International response United States Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs John Kirby announced that the United States was supportive of the intervention. United Kingdom's Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs Boris Johnson called on Jammeh to step down and praised \\"African organisations which are working to ensure the democratic wishes of the Gambian people will be respected\\", adding that the presidential elections had been free and fair. The UN Security Council voted unanimously on 19 January to pass United Nations Security Council Resolution 2337 requesting a peaceful transition of power. The resolution did not endorse the use of military force. It instead requested ECOWAS to pursue \\"political means first\\".

Emergency assistance is gradually being increased in areas that were previously unreachable. In Rann, around 43,000 people are internally displaced and struggle with serious food shortages and severe acute malnutrition. Humanitarian access to the area has been difficult due to insecurity and bad roads, as stated by United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in its press release.EMERGENCY RESPONSE MOBILISED FOLLOWING AIRSTRIKE ON RANN LOCALITY. On 17 January 2017, the Nigerian Air Force mistakenly bombed the camp, leaving at least 52 people dead and over 100 injured. On 14 January 2019, Rann was overrun by Boko Haram insurgents amid a general increase of insurgent attacks in the area, and destroyed, with many inhabitants fleeing across the border to Bodo in Cameroon. At the time, the town had been home to 35,000 refugees. Though the attack was initially attributed to Abu Musab al-Barnawi's ISWAP, Abubakar Shekau's Boko Haram later claimed responsibility. Though the Nigerian military and allied Cameroonian Armed Forces forces subsequently retook Rann, they later abandoned it, so Boko Haram launched another raid against the town on 28 January 2019. The militants again set the settlement ablaze, murdered local elders, and caused tens of thousands to flee. This time, the refugees from Rann relocated to Goura in Cameroon's Far North Region.

He was Registrar General and Protector of Chinese from 1856 to 1862 and was involved in the notorious Caldwell Affair in the late 1850s. Early life He was born in British East India Company's island of Saint Helena to Daniel Caldwell and Mary Caldwell on 13 September 1816. When he was little, he followed his father, a soldier in a local militia corps first to Penang and then to Singapore. In 1834, he commanded his own trading ships before becoming a clerk in Canton, where he was employed in a lucrative opium trading company. \\"He has a reputation as a womaniser and was said to have learned Chinese through his liaisons with various women,\\" according to historian Christopher Munn. Due to his sound linguistic skills, in which he was fluent in several Chinese dialects as well as Malay, Hindustani and Portuguese, Caldwell served as an interpreter to the British during the First Opium War. Career in Hong Kong In 1842 he settled in Hong Kong and became essential to the colonial administration in dealing with the local Chinese in the earliest years of Hong Kong as a British colony. He first worked as court interpreter, and then appointed assistant superintendent of the Hong Kong Police in 1846. He resigned from the government for the first time when he declared bankruptcy in 1847 and escaped creditors by fleeing to the neighbouring Portuguese colony of Macao. He was again employed by the government soon afterwards. Caldwell was effective in clamping down on crime and piracy by using his network of informers, being head of detectives and guide to the Royal Navy in its expeditions against pirates. He was involved in the Battle of Huhlan Bay which took place on 4 August 1855, in which HMS Rattler and USS Powhattan destroyed ten pirate junks and killed more than 800 pirates. Soon after the battle, Caldwell resigned from the government due to low pay and purchased a merchant steamer, The Eaglet, which ran coastal trade and set up convoys escorting junks along the South China coast. When the Second Opium War broke out, calling Caldwell \\"the only government functionary through whom we have ever had satisfactory intercourse with the native population\\", Governor John Bowring employed Caldwell as Registrar General and Protector of Chinese (later Secretary for Chinese Affairs), which dealt with the issues related to the local Chinese community in 1856. He was given extensive powers over the lives and businesses of local Chinese under the emergency legislation in 1857 and 1858. His duties was also extended to the registration and licensing of brothels under the new Venereal Diseases Ordinance. His power and influence boosted by his extensive connections in the Chinese society and his guidance to the Royal Navy on the anti-pirate expeditions and his guidance to the government to track down wanted criminals and communicate with the Chinese community. he uncovered an assassination plot of himself and Lieutenant Governor William Caine in April 1857. Caldwell Affair In early 1857, some Chinese agents attempted to poison the European community through its morning bread supply, which caused the fear and suspicion between the local Chinese and European residents. In the same year, Caldwell was involved in a scandal as an American pirate Eli Boggs accused Caldwell of having criminal connections with notorious gangster and claimed he had been framed by Wong Ma-chow, who was a key informer and associate of Caldwell. Wong was arrested on 16 July 1857, followed by the defence from Caldwell who demanded an acquittal. On 10 May 1858, the Colonial Treasurer Frederick Forth made an allegation of Caldwell owning a brothel. Attorney General Thomas Chisholm Anstey weighed in, by calling Caldwell a \\"brothel keeper and pirate\\" and referring to his wife, a Chinese woman named Mary Ayow, as \\"that harlot\\". Even Caldwell's own racial identity was questioned, who had only a few years earlier been described as having \\"blue eyes and truly English countenance\\", was now described as a \\"man of mixed blood\\" and a \\"Singapore half-caste\\". The scandal was described by Governor Bowring as \\"seldom been paralleled by any assemblage of Englishmen met in official conclave.\\" The Acting Colonial Secretary W. T. Bridges, who was a Freemason like Caldwell destroyed Wong Ma-chow's account books, the crucial evidence which allegedly contained entries firmly implicating Caldwell in Wong's piratical activities, in the name of saving office space. To play down the allegations, Bowring set up a Commission of Inquiry which consisted of friends of Caldwell's. Its chairman, the Surveyor General Charles Cleverly, was also a Freemason. One of the four members was Legislative Councillor George Lyall was a close friend of Caldwell's. The commission's counsel, John Day, had defended Wong Ma-chow. Anstey was later suspended and sent back to Britain, and the government sued the journalist William Tarrant, who had revealed Bridges' protection of Caldwell, for libel. Anstey went on to wrote a 30,000-word letter to The Times detailing the corruption of the \\"reign of terror\\" in the Hong Kong government, which brought the scandals to the British press and parliament. Caldwell went on to take the vital role in the clamping down pirates by directing Royal Navy warships in anti-piracy operations. After Bowring was replaced as governor by Hercules Robinson in 1859, another Commission of Inquiry was set up over the Caldwell Affair, chaired by the new governor himself. Caldwell claimed that the allegations against him were a conspiracy based on the grudges of Charles May, Anstey, and some newspaper editors jealous of his success and resentful of his protective attitude towards the Chinese. He went on accusing May of running an illegal brothel, managed by a mistress of his, to which Anstey was a frequent visitor. Caldwell wrote that \\"of all places in the world perhaps there is not one where scandal and detraction are more rife, so readily invented, so industriously circulated and, I regret to add, so eagerly sought after, as at Hong Kong.\\" The inquiry found decisively against Caldwell on the charge of perverting the course of justice and found grounds for suspicion on other charges, including having used the Royal Navy to carry out the \\"nefarious designs\\" and strengthen the influence of a \\"notorious pirate\\". It declared Caldwell unfit for public service. Later life, family and death After being dismissed by the government, he made a good living as a Chinese agent, an intermediary and advocate for Chinese businesses. Subsequently, Governor Richard Graves MacDonnell employed him as advisor to the licensed gaming-house keepers and an unofficial head of the secret police which were considered more effective at detecting crime and catching criminals than the Police Force itself. Caldwell was a Freemason. He married Mary Chan Ayow in about 1845 through a traditional Chinese marriage ceremony. She was converted and became a member of the London Missionary Society congregation. A Christian marriage service was performed at the St. John's Cathedral in March 1851. The couple had 12 children and over 20 adopted children of Chinese descent. He died in Hong Kong on 2 October 1875 and buried at the Hong Kong Cemetery in Happy Valley, Hong Kong where a huge and ornate tombstone was erected by his fellow Freemasons. After Caldwell's death, Chan Ayow inherited his properties. She sold the property located at the intersection of Hollywood Road and Aberdeen Street to the London Missionary Society at HK$35,000 which was half of its worth at the time. On this site was later built Alice Memorial Hospital and the Hong Kong College of Medicine and To Tsai Church where Dr. Sun Yat-sen studied and worshiped in his early days.

Two additional processors, the 3031 and the 3032, were announced on October 6, 1977. All three 303X systems were withdrawn on February 5, 1985. Features The CPUs feature instruction pipelining, \\"several instructions can be pre-fetched while one is being executed\\". \\"Processor storage ... is four-way interleaved\\" resulting in \\"a significantly faster data rate than... non-interleaved\\". Each of the three systems includes, as a standard feature, a Dual-display console, the newly announced IBM 3036. The systems consume less than half the floor space of a System/370 with an equal amount of computer memory and an identical number of channels because \\"the channels are physically integrated within the processor mainframe.\\" Each group of six channels has its own microprogrammed channel processor, a System/370-158-type processor running special channel microcode.

By the late 1970s and early 1980s, patented technology allowed Amdahl IBM-compatible mainframes of this era to be completely air- cooled, unlike IBM systems that required chilled water and its supporting infrastructure‚Äî the 8 largest of the 18 models of the ES/9000 systems introduced in 1990 were water-cooled; the other ten were air-cooled. \\"The 3033 model, introduced in response to competition from the Amdahl Corporation, represented almost a 100 percent improvement in performance over the previous model, at only a 12 percent increase in price\\". The improvement in Price‚Äìperformance of the 303X models created volume of orders sufficient to cause a backlog. \\"The backlog backfired. IBM inadvertently gave Amdahl a huge boost when the results of its \\"delivery lottery\\" pushed some customer shipments all the way into 1980\\". In October, 1977 Computerworld reported that Itel's \\"air-cooled AS/6\\" was announced \\"within six hours of the IBM announcement\\" and due to ship \\"the same time deliveries of the IBM 3032 are slated to begin.\\" Magnuson Computer Systems also produced the M80 System/370-compatible computer system between 1975 and 1980.

In June 2013, the Supreme Court struck down Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act, which resulted in the recognition of legally performed same-sex marriages by the federal government. In 2015, the Court ruled that all states must grant same-sex marriages as well as recognize others performed in different states in Obergefell v. Hodges. After unprecedented media coverage, business tycoon Donald Trump defeated former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election leading to Republicans gaining control of all branches of government. His election, on the heels of the Brexit referendum in the United Kingdom, was a populist rebuke of the political establishment as he promised to \\"drain the swamp\\" in Washington and to put \\"America first\\" in foreign and domestic policy. His administration also faced opposition, with a series of marches and protests, notably Women's Marches that brought nearly five million marchers worldwide.https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-says-he-has-delivered-100-days- of-action-1493513889. On the domestic front, Trump signed a tax cut for individuals and corporations and reduced federal regulations, and oversaw a continuation of a strong economy that followed the last decade's recession and the lowest unemployment rates in decades. Republicans in Congress pushed to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, ultimately failing to pass a replacement, while repealing the law's individual health insurance mandate as part of their 2017 tax cut legislation. Throughout his term, Trump pushed to secure the United States-Mexico border and curb illegal immigration. Some of his immigration polices (\\"Muslim ban\\", family separations at Southern border, advocacy for a transcontinental border wall) were subject of controversy. In foreign policy, Trump sought to renegotiate trade deals with the United States‚ÄìMexico‚ÄìCanada Agreement replacing NAFTA, and a Phase 1 trade deal with China as part of an ongoing trade war, among others. The Trump administration withdrew the United States from the Iran Nuclear Deal signed under the Obama administration, sought to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula - meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore, in Vietnam, and at the DMZ, moved the US Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, brokered a peace agreement between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, and pressured European nations in NATO to increase their defense spending. In 2018, Democrats regained control of the House of Representatives, sending its most diverse delegation to date including a record number of women, while Republicans added slightly to their Senate majority. During the 2010s, the country has seen troubles in race relations. After the killings of many African Americans such as Eric Garner, Michael Brown, and Philando Castile by policemen resulted in no prosecution, the Black Lives Matter movement sparked discussions, protests, and riots against racial profiling, police brutality, and overall racism between white and black Americans. America saw the rise of the alt-right movement. In August 2017, these groups attended a rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, during which a neo-Nazi rammed a car into and killed a protester against the rally. Since the mid-2010s, the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Bureau of Investigation now consider the threat of white supremacist and alt-right violence the leading threat of domestic terrorism in the United States. A series of deadly mass shootings, especially the Aurora movie theater massacre and the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre, sparked a heated debate over gun control and the causes of these events. The 2016 Orlando shooting at a gay nightclub renewed discussions of violence and discrimination against the LGBT community as well as Islamic terrorism. This period is also marked by a major shift away from the support of long-established media outlets such as CNN, NBC, Fox News and MSNBC. The phenomenon of fake news became prevalent throughout the 2016 election cycle and in its aftermath. As a result, mistrust in mainstream media outlets increased among the American public and alternate sources of news began to arise. What became known as the \\"legacy media\\" began to see a drop off in ratings and overall support, facing harsh criticism over misinformation, censorship, and threats of doxing made against private individuals. A shift towards independent news sources, located on YouTube, social networks, and independently owned sites began to occur, collecting the brunt of the Legacy Media's former audience. Social media platforms became ubiquitous during this period, and smartphone sales grew exponentially, contributing to the general movement of the population towards more usage of electronic devices. Anthropogenic climate change grew to be recognized as the world's largest threat in the scientific community. The planet is on track to far surpass the 2 degree Celsius benchmark. In 2017, President Trump withdrew the U.S. from the Paris Agreement. Secondary concerns of this period's environmentalists include the mass extinction, microplastic pollution, and the destruction of the world's last wildernesses. On December 19, 2019, the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives, for the third time in U.S. history, voted to pass articles of impeachment against a sitting president. President Donald Trump was impeached due to allegations of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. On February 5, 2020, he was acquitted by the Republican-controlled U.S. Senate. Every Democrat voted to convict while every Republican, with the exception of Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, voted to acquit. On January 15, 2020, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus spread to the US after an individual carrying the virus arrived in Everett, Washington after traveling from Wuhan, China. Health officials confirmed this was the first case of the virus in the United States on January 20, 2020. The SARS-CoV-2 virus causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and over the course of the next three months, the disease affected over 5 million Americans and killed over 167,000 Americans. As of July 30, 2020, the number of Americans who have died from COVID-19 surpassed 150,000. The United States is by far the country with the most confirmed cases of COVID-19. The country continues to struggle to effectively react and counter the spread of the virus in all 50 U.S. states and territories except American Samoa. Conflicts War in Afghanistan The War in Afghanistan continued. In September 2008, President Bush announced he would shift 4,500 U.S. troops from Iraq to the conflict in Afghanistan. This was followed with recently elected President Barack Obama announcing in February 2009 that the United States would deploy an additional 17,000 troops to Afghanistan. The Obama administration also later announced a \\"troop surge\\" of an additional 30,000 U.S. military forces to be deployed in the summer of 2010, and to begin withdrawals of the 100,000 total U.S. troops in July 2011. With the surge in effect, the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) launched Operation Moshtarak, an offensive determined to eliminate Taliban insurgents from Helmand Province. At 15,000 troops, it was the largest joint operation of the war. After a 2010 profile on U.S. Army general and ISAF Commander Stanley McChrystal was published in the magazine Rolling Stone, McChrystal was forced to resign from his position after making controversial remarks about Obama administration officials. President Obama then announced ISAF to be commanded by General David Petraeus. The U.S. national security team gathered in the White House Situation Room to monitor the progress of Operation Neptune Spear, which resulted in the death of Osama bin Laden. On May 1, 2011, President Barack Obama announced that the U.S. conducted an operation that killed al- Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden at his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. The announcement drew worldwide praise, with spontaneous celebrations at Ground Zero, Times Square, and outside of the White House. The raid on bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad led to a rise in diplomatic tensions between the U.S. and Pakistan. With civilian deaths from the United States' drone program in so-called \\"signature strikes\\", the 2011 NATO attack in Pakistan, which led to the deaths of 24 Pakistani military officers, and the closure of NATO supply lines to neighboring Afghanistan, Pakistan‚ÄìUnited States relations remain fractured as a result of the War on Terror. In mid-2011 President Obama announced the start of the withdrawal of the additional 33,000 troops deployed from the 2010 troop surge. By December 2011, the first round of 10,000 troops were withdrawn, with the second round of 23,000 troops later withdrawn in September 2012. As of February 2014, a total of 2,307 U.S. troops were killed and 19,656 injured due to the Afghanistan War. Estimates from the Brown University Watson Institute for International Studies also suggest that between 16,725‚Äì19,013 Afghan civilians died as a result of the war. ISAF ceased combat operations and was disbanded in December 2014, with a small number of troops remaining behind in an advisory role as part of ISAF's successor organization, the Resolute Support Mission. Iraq War As the situation in Iraq became increasingly difficult, policymakers began looking for new options. This led to the formation of the Iraq Study Group, a nonpartisan commission chaired by James Baker and Lee H. Hamilton. This produced a variety of proposals; some of the more notable ones were to seek decreased U.S. presence in Iraq, increased engagement with neighboring countries, and greater attention to resolving other local conflicts, such as the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict. The recommendations were generally ignored, and instead, President Bush ordered a surge of troops to Iraq in 2007 and 2008. Violence in the country declined in 2008 and 2009, and the U.S. combat role ended in August 2010. U.S. forces were withdrawn in large numbers in 2009 and 2010, and the war was declared formally over in December 2011. Domestic terrorism The scene immediately after the first bomb explosion in the Boston Marathon bombings. On April 15, 2013, two bombs exploded near the finish line of the Boston Marathon in Boston, Massachusetts, killing three people and injuring over 280. Three days later, suspects Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev led Boston police on a high speed chase, after killing one officer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Tamerlan was killed in a shootout with police and a seriously injured Dzhokhar was taken into custody in nearby Watertown the following day. On December 2, 2015, in the 2015 San Bernardino attack, 14 people were killed and 22 were injured in a mass shooting at a workplace Christmas party at the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino, California. Both a workplace shooting and a terrorist attack, the incident was perpetrated by Rizwan Farook, a healthcare worker who was employed at the facility, and his wife Tashfeen Malik. The pair were U.S. citizens of Pakistani descent who had become radicalized and had expressed a commitment to jihadism prior to the attack. The attack also included an attempted bombing. Four hours after the attack, the perpetrators were killed by police in a shootout that left two officers injured. In late October 2018, 16 packages containing pipe bombs were mailed via the U.S. Postal Service to several prominent critics of U.S. President Donald Trump, including leading Democratic Party politicians such as former U.S. President Barack Obama, former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, and former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, as well as CNN offices in New York City. On March 21, 2019, Cesar Sayoc, 57, pleaded guilty to 65 felony charges related to the bombing, including using weapons of mass destruction and domestic terrorism. Crime and violence Continuing the increase in high-profile mass school shootings seen in the late 1990s and 2000s, additional school shootings rocked the country in the 2010s, the deadliest of which were the Oikos University shooting (2012), the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting (2012), the Isla Vista killings (2014), the Umpqua Community College shooting (2015), the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting (2018), and the Santa Fe High School shooting (2018). These shootings, particularly the Sandy Hook and Stoneman Douglas shootings, heightened the debate over gun politics, and continued the public dialogue about improving mental health care and school safety. The Las Vegas sign adorned with flowers a week after the deadliest mass shooting in American history took place on the Las Vegas strip. In November 2009, U.S. Army major Nidal Malik Hasan killed 13 fellow soldiers and injured 30 in the Fort Hood shooting in Killeen, Texas. While the act was called terrorism by some due to Hasan's Muslim heritage, the attack was ruled out by the FBI to have been perpetrated by a terrorist organization. On January 8, 2011, U.S. Representative Gabrielle Giffords was the target of an assassination attempt, when a gunman went on a shooting spree, critically injuring Giffords, killing federal judge John Roll and five other people, and wounding 14 others. In July 2012, a man shot 70 people (up to that time, the highest number of victims of any mass shooting in American history) at a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, killing 12 and injuring 58 others. On June 12, 2016, a mass shooting in a Florida gay nightclub killed 50 people, including the man responsible for it. It surpassed 2007's Virginia Tech shooting as the deadliest mass shooting in American history, and was also classified as a terrorist attack and a hate crime against the LGBT community. On October 1, 2017, the Orlando nightclub shooting was surpassed by the 2017 Las Vegas shooting as the deadliest mass shooting in American history when a gunman fired from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay onto a crowd of concertgoers at the Route 91 Harvest music festival, killing 58 and injuring 869, before killing himself. This shooting led to an increased dialogue and debate over gun control, particularly the use of bump stocks which allowed the shooter to fire his semi-automatic rifle at a rate similar to a fully automatic weapon. Concerns about public event safety and hotel security also became a focus of public dialogue in the wake of this event. In addition, the investigation was the focus of intense scrutiny, particularly as the official reports and timelines changed several times throughout the investigation. This also led to a number of conspiracy theories. Disasters Natural disasters President Barack Obama greets survivors of the devastating 2011 Joplin tornado. In the spring of 2011, several major tornado outbreaks affected the Central and Southern United States. Forty-three people were killed in a tornado outbreak from April 14‚Äì16. Approximately 350+ people were killed in a tornado outbreak from April 25‚Äì28, the deadliest U.S. tornado outbreak in 75 years (since the 1936 Tupelo- Gainesville tornado outbreak). States particularly hit hard by the outbreaks included Oklahoma, Arkansas, Mississippi, Tennessee, Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia, and most especially, Alabama, which sustained over 250 fatalities alone. The latter outbreak produced $10 billion in damage, making it the costliest tornado outbreak in history. On May 22, an EF5 tornado devastated Joplin, Missouri, killing 154, injuring over 1,000 people, and causing $1‚Äì3 billion in damage, making it the deadliest single U.S. tornado in 64 years and the costliest single tornado of all time. In August 2011, Hurricane Irene was the first hurricane to make landfall since Ike in 2008, striking the Eastern Seaboard of the United States, making landfalls in North Carolina, New Jersey, and New York. The storm killed at least 45 people and caused $10 billion in damage. The storm was particularly notable for its extensive flooding in the Northeast, and a couple days later, Tropical Storm Lee made landfall in Louisiana, its remnants tracking to the Northeast for even more devastating floods. In October 2012, Hurricane Sandy struck the East Coast of the United States, making landfall near Atlantic City, New Jersey. The storm knocked out power to millions of people and caused flooding in parts of New York City along with devastation to the Jersey Shore and portions of Long Island and Staten Island. The storm has been blamed for 121 fatalities and is estimated to have caused at least $50 billion in damage. In May 2013, at least 24 people were killed, 377 people were injured, and $1.5 to $3 billion in damage was caused when an EF5 tornado struck the Oklahoma City suburb of Moore, which was hit by a deadly and destructive F5 tornado only 14 years prior. In August 2017, Hurricane Harvey became the first major hurricane to make landfall in the United States since Hurricane Wilma in 2005. It devastated Houston, Texas, causing extreme flooding, 83 confirmed deaths, and an estimated $70 billion to $200 billion in damage. Harvey's highest winds hit 130 mph. In September 2017, Hurricane Irma hit Florida, killing 102 people and causing over $62.87 billion in damage, making it unofficially the fourth-costliest hurricane on record. The size of the storm spanned across the entire Florida peninsula, and all 67 counties of Florida declared a state of emergency. Irma's highest winds were 185 mph. Later in September 2017, Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory, killing over 547 people and causing over $91.6 billion in damage, making it the third-costliest Atlantic hurricane on record. Maria's highest winds were 175 mph. On September 14, 2018, Hurricane Florence hit North Carolina as a Category 1 Hurricane, causing major flooding. 39 deaths were counted and damage is estimated as $17 billion (2018 U.S.D). Florence's highest winds were 140 mph. On October 10, Hurricane Michael struck the Florida Panhandle as a Category 5 storm with 160 mph winds after undergoing rapid intensification just prior to landfall; it killed 45 people in the U.S. and caused $15 billion in damage. In November 2018, several wildfires devastated portions of California, most notably the Camp Fire in Butte County in Northern California, which burned over 150,000 acres and destroyed nearly 19,000 structures. With a death toll of 86 and damages up to $10 billion, it was the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in California history and the deadliest U.S. wildfire since 1918. A series of earthquakes struck Southern California on July 4 and 5, 2019. A magnitude 6.4 earthquake, a foreshock, struck near the desert city of Ridgecrest, on July 4. On July 5, a 7.1 earthquake struck, the main shock, centered near the first. The latter was the largest earthquake to hit Southern California in 20 years. Relatively minor damage resulted from the initial foreshock, though some building fires were reported in Ridgecrest near the epicenter. Effects were felt across much of Southern California as well as parts of Arizona and Nevada, as far north as the San Francisco Bay Area and Sacramento, and as far south as Baja California, Mexico. An estimated 20 million people experienced the foreshock, and approximately 30 million people experienced the mainshock.https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/05/us/california-earthquake/index.html Other disasters The Deepwater Horizon oil rig burns after exploding in April 2010. The disaster led to the largest oil spill in U.S. history. On April 20, 2010, an offshore oil drilling rig, the Deepwater Horizon, exploded and burned off the coast of Louisiana in the Gulf of Mexico.Carl Safina, A Sea in Flames: The Deepwater Horizon Oil Blowout (2011) Dozens of workers fled the flames and were rescued by lifeboats and helicopters, however 11 were killed and 17 were injured in the incident. The rig burned for 36 hours before sinking. On April 24, it was discovered that a damaged wellhead was leaking oil into the Gulf of Mexico at a rapid rate. For approximately 90 days, tens of thousands of barrels of oil leaked into the ocean every day, resulting in the largest oil spill in United States history. The wellhead was successfully contained in mid-July, stopping the flow, and efforts are ongoing to cap the wellhead and create a replacement well. Despite significant efforts to protect coastlines, the spill has had devastating impacts on the environment and the economies of the Gulf Coast states. The Obama administration has ordered well operator BP responsible for all cleanup costs, which are expected to run in the tens of billions of dollars. The spill has resulted in negative public approval ratings of the U.S. government, the Obama administration, and BP, for their handling of the spill, with BP suffering the worst ratings.Tom Shroder and John Konrad, Fire on the Horizon: The Untold Story of the Gulf Oil Disaster (2011.Earl Boebert, et al. Deepwater Horizon: A Systems Analysis of the Macondo Disaster (2016). Religion A 2014 Religious Landscape Study conducted by Pew Research Center from June 4 to September 30, 2014 found Christianity declined 7.8% from 78.4% in 2007 to 70.6% in 2014, unaffiliated rose 6.7% from 16.1% in 2007 to 22.8% in 2014, and non-Christian religions rose 1.2% from 4.7% in 2007 to 5.9% in 2014. Politics The Great Recession U.S. Employment Statistics (unemployment rate and monthly changes in net employment), 2009‚Äì2016; the U.S. unemployment rate topped 8% (one month even reaching 10% level) from 2009 to 2012 during the Great Recession. In 2007, while U.S. unemployment dropped to its lowest level since the year 2000, the housing bubble reached its peak and economic growth slowed down, and by December 2007, the United States entered a severe long-lasting recession. By mid-2008, property values and the values of other assets plummeted, and the stock market crashed in October 2008, spurred by a lack of investor confidence as the liquidity of assets began to evaporate. With the decline in wealth and the lack of investor and consumer confidence, growth and economic activity came to a screeching halt and the job growth of previous years was soon wiped out, with mass layoffs and unemployment rising rapidly in late 2008, and continuing into 2009.Thomas Payne, The Great Recession: What Happened (2012)* Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke told a federal commission in November 2009, \\"As a scholar of the Great Depression, I honestly believe that September and October of 2008 was the worst financial crisis in global history, including the Great Depression.\\" Of the 13 most important U.S. financial institutions, \\"12 were at risk of failure within a period of a week or two\\".Quoted in Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, The Financial Crisis Inquiry Report. 2011. ch. 20. p. 354. The Federal Reserve and the Treasury cooperated by pouring trillions into a financial system that had frozen up worldwide. They rescued many of the large financial corporations from bankruptcy ‚Äì with the exception of Lehman Brothers, which went bankrupt ‚Äì and took government control of insurance giant AIG, mortgage banks Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and both General Motors and Chrysler.Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, Financial Crisis Inquiry Report (2011); and \\"Resource Library\\" online In October 2008, Bush sought, and Congress passed, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (commonly referred to as the \\"bank bailout\\") with the goal of protecting the U.S. financial system from complete collapse in the wake of the late-2000s recession, which brought significant declines in the stock market. The bill provided federal government guarantees of up to $700 billion to troubled financial institutions through the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). By 2010, only a fraction of that money was ever spent, as banks were able to quickly repay loans from the federal government or ended up never needing the money. Meanwhile, unemployment doubled to nearly 10%, with states such as California and Michigan especially hard hit. While the stock market rebounded by 2011, and corporate profits had recovered, unemployment remained over 9% into 2011. The recession was worldwide, with Europe and Japan hard hit, while China, India and Canada fared much better. The Obama administration Obama sworn in as the 44th President of the United States The nation went into the 2008 election cycle having a Republican president and Democratic Congress both with extremely low approval ratings. New York Senator Hillary Clinton had the inside track for the nomination but faced an unexpected challenge from Barack Obama, the nearly unknown junior Senator from Illinois. The GOP nominated Arizona Senator John McCain. During the general election, Obama's youthfulness, charisma, and widespread media support proved effective against McCain, seen as a stodgy Washington insider. In addition, his relatively advanced age (72) and injuries from captivity in the Vietnam War drew doubts over his health and stamina. Overall disillusionment with the Republican Party and George Bush's administration did not help McCain's cause, and his choice of Alaska governor Sarah Palin as his running mate also drew some controversy. Obama also drew some doubts over his inexperience and controversial associations with Weather Underground founder William Ayers and Reverend Jeremiah Wright, the pastor of an African-American church Obama had attended for years who was discovered to have made anti-white sermons. The decisive event was the collapse of the national financial system over the summer, launching a severe worldwide depressionDaniel J. Balz and Haynes Johnson, The Battle for America 2008: The Story of an Extraordinary Election (2009); ch 26 is \\"Palinmania\\"; ch 27, on the economy is \\"Collapse\\" On November 4, 2008, Obama defeated McCain 365 to 173 in the electoral vote and 52.9% to 45.7% in the popular vote to become the 44th President of the United States, making history in becoming the first African American to be elected to the highest executive office. Part of the strong showing came from a surge of support from younger voters, African Americans, Hispanics and independents. Democrats made further gains in Congress, adding to the majorities they had won in 2006.Chuck Todd, and Sheldon Gawiser, How Barack Obama Won: A State-by- State Guide to the Historic 2008 Presidential Election (2009) Obama's early policy decisions addressed a continuing global financial crisis and have included changes in tax policies, foreign policy initiatives and the phasing out of detention of prisoners at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp in Cuba. Within a few weeks of taking office, the new president and Congress passed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which was ostensibly aimed at recovering from the economic collapse. This entailed a $700 billion stimulus package for the economy, although there were considerable questions over the amount of money spent or its actual effectiveness.Morton Keller, Obama's Time: a History (2015) Barack Obama and Sonia Sotomayor sitting in front of the Oval Office fireplace. A domestic initiative passed by the 111th Congress and signed into law by President Obama was the Affordable Care Act, an important statute guaranteeing comprehensive medical coverage to all Americans, regardless of age, sex, pre-existing health conditions or ability to pay. In foreign policy, President Obama withdrew U.S. troops from Iraq in large numbers, bringing the Iraq War to an end in December 2011. At the same time, he also increased troop levels in the Afghanistan War. Early in his presidency, he successfully negotiated the New START treaty with the Russian Federation, which made significant reductions in their nuclear arsenals. The U.S. also maintained ongoing talks, led by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, with North Korea over its nuclear weapons program, as well as with Israel and the Palestinian Authority over a two-state solution to the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict. In May 2011, President Obama announced in a televised speech to the nation that al-Qaeda leader and culprit behind many deadly acts of terrorism (including the September 11 attacks) Osama bin Laden was killed by U.S. forces at a compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. Tea Party protesters on the West Lawn of the U.S. Capitol and the National Mall at the Taxpayer March on Washington in September 2009. Although the recession reached its bottom in June 2009 and began to move up again, voters remained frustrated with the slow pace of the economic recovery. In the spring of 2009, large protests erupted in Washington, DC from conservative groups who began calling themselves the \\"Tea Party\\" and who were particularly opposed to the controversial stimulus act. The Tea Party would end up in a few years as a springboard for a large-scale Republican revival. In the 2010 midterms, the GOP retook control of the House, although the Senate remained in Democratic hands. Under the new Congress, which had a Republican House and a Democratic Senate, President Obama and Congress clashed for months over whether or not to raise the debt ceiling and whether or not to extend the payroll tax cuts for middle-income citizens that Obama signed into law. After months of heated debate, the debt ceiling was ultimately raised and the tax cuts extended. However, Obama's approval ratings continued to hover at around 46%, while Congress had an even lower approval rating of 11%. In the 2012 presidential election, the GOP nominated former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney. Much like John McCain four years earlier, Romney was largely seen as a tepid moderate and a Beltway insider who did not inspire the conservative base of the Republican Party, nor independents. He also drew controversy for his stand on Obamacare, which had been based on the system he implemented in Massachusetts. Obama defeated his opponent to win a second term, with a tally in the Electoral College by 332 to 206 and in the popular vote by 51.06% to 47.21%. The electoral map remained the same as 2008, with the exception of North Carolina and Indiana flipping back as red states, and the party balance in Congress remained largely unchanged. In the November 2014 midterm elections, the Republican Party took control of the Senate and expanded its majority in the House of Representatives, an event that portended an ill omen for the Democrats. On December 17, 2014, President Barack Obama announced a restoration of full diplomatic relations with Cuba for the first time since 1961. A deal between the United States and Cuba was brokered during 18 months of secret talks hosted by Canada, with a final meeting hosted by Pope Francis at the Vatican. Although the U.S. embargo remains in effect and ordinary tourism by Americans is still prohibited, the United States will ease travel restrictions, release three Cuban spies, and open an embassy in Havana.

Outside the Supreme Court, a crowd celebrates the Court's decision that same- sex marriage is a constitutionally protected right under the 14th Amendment, a key win for gay rights. On June 26, 2015, the Supreme Court ruled, 5‚Äì4, in the case of Obergefell vs. Hodges that same-sex marriage was a constitutionally protected right under the 14th Amendment. Shortly before the ruling, polling showed the majority of Americans approving of same-sex marriage. The ruling was celebrated by many, and President Obama advertised his support for the ruling by coloring the White House in gay pride colors using lights. This ruling was not achieved without controversy, as it did little to change the minds of those that disapproved of homosexuality in general. In regards to the Supreme Court, President Obama faced three vacancies during his administration. Justice David Souter retired in June 2009 and the president nominated as his replacement Sonia Sotomayor, the first Hispanic Supreme Court Justice in U.S. history. Justice John Paul Stevens retired exactly one year later and Obama replaced him with Elena Kagan. Justice Antonin Scalia died on February 13, 2016. President Obama nominated Merrick Garland as his replacement, but the United States Senate, led by Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell refused to give Garland a hearing, instead arguing that the winner of the ongoing presidential election be given the opportunity to nominate Scalia's replacement instead. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was pressured by liberal groups to retire while the Democrats remained in control of the White House, but declined to do so. On September 25, 2015, John Boehner announced that he would step down as Speaker and resign from Congress at the end of October 2015. Boehner's resignation took place after Pope Francis' address to Congress the day before, an event considered by Boehner as a high point in his legislative career. Boehner was replaced by Republican Paul Ryan, the U.S. Representative for Wisconsin's 1st congressional district and former candidate for Vice President along with Mitt Romney. Sources in Boehner's office indicated he was stepping aside in the face of increasing discord while trying to manage passage of a continuing resolution to fund the government. Conservative opposition to funding Planned Parenthood as part of the resolution, and stronger threats to Boehner's leadership on account of the controversy, prompted the abrupt announcement. Members of the caucus indicated that the resignation opened the way for a \\"clean bill\\" for government funding to pass, and \\"a commitment [was] made that there [would] be no shutdown.\\" The Trump administration 2016 Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump campaigns at a rally in Phoenix, Arizona, October 29, 2016. In the 2016 presidential election, the GOP had 17 candidates. The Democratic Party had fewer potential candidates to choose from, and the campaign early on centered on Hillary Clinton, former Secretary of State, United States Senator from New York, and First Lady of the United States. A surprise challenger to Clinton appeared in 74-year-old Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, a self-identified democratic socialist and the one of only two independents in the Senate. Despite attracting a large, enthusiastic following among mostly young voters, Sanders was unable to secure the nomination. When the primary season finished in the spring, Clinton secured the Democratic nomination. Senator Bernie Sanders finally conceded the race, endorsing then presumptive nominee Hillary Clinton. Women's March on Washington Meanwhile, in June 2015, real estate mogul Donald Trump announced that he was seeking the presidency. Although Trump's announcement received little attention at first (he had mounted a short-lived third party presidential run in 2000), he quickly bounded out of the gate with a populist message about his perceived decline of American economic and geopolitical prestige under the previous two administrations. By the start of the primary season in early 2016, Trump was polling ahead of the other GOP candidates despite his lack of political experience and attracting a considerable following among the party base. By the spring of 2016, most GOP candidates had dropped out of the running and Trump had no remaining challengers other than Ted Cruz. Some right wing conservatives and Christian groups continued to support Cruz, especially as there was controversy over Trump's personal life and relatively liberal attitude on social issues. However, Trump's economic message had widespread populist appeal and on May 3, Ted Cruz officially ended his presidential campaign. As the primaries gave way to the general election, Hillary Clinton faced numerous controversies over her tenure as Secretary of State, namely an email server scandal. Polls and surveys showed that both Clinton and Trump had an overall negative image among voters. Meanwhile, Donald Trump chose as his running mate Indiana Governor Mike Pence. Pence, a staunch conservative Christian, was seen as a way of winning over heartland conservatives, many of whom were Ted Cruz supporters wary of Trump's attitude on social issues. Clinton chose as her running mate Virginia Senator Tim Kaine, seen as a way of connecting with blue collar white voters, Trump's base of support.James W. Ceaser, Andrew E. Busch, et al. Defying the Odds: The 2016 Elections and American Politics (2017) symbol of Me Too movement hashtag. During the general election, controversies over remarks Donald Trump had made over the years seen as demeaning to women came up, including a beauty pageant he had been a judge on in the 1990s where he had criticized the appearance of a contestant, as well as a leaked 2005 audio tape in which he made vulgar statements about the treatment of women. Hillary Clinton, however, continued to be embroiled in controversies of her own, the biggest being the revelation that she had used an unsecured private email server during her tenure as Secretary of State, leaving the possibility of having mismanaged or compromised classified documents. In addition, John Podesta, Clinton's campaign manager, had his private email account hacked, releasing over 20,000 campaign emails in October and November 2016 by WikiLeaks.Ceaser, 2017. President Donald Trump and his daughter Ivanka Trump, one of his senior advisors. On Election Day, November 8, Trump carried 306 electoral votes against Clinton's 232. He made considerable inroads into the old Rust Belt, carrying states such as Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania that had been safe Democratic territory since 1988. However, Donald Trump did not win the popular vote. This was the fourth time in American history that the outcome of the Electoral College did not match the outcome of the popular vote, the others happening in 1876, 1888, and 2000. The GOP also retained control a majority in both the House of Representatives and the Senate, controlling all branches of government. Allegations of Russian interference on behalf of Trump's candidacy in the 2016 election caused controversy during and after the election. On January 20, 2017, Trump took the oath of office as the 45th U.S .president in the face of large-scale demonstrations from protesters unhappy with the outcome of the election and of the incoming president. On his first day in office, he undertook a series of executive orders aimed at dismantling the Affordable Care Act and Trans-Pacific Partnership, and also moved to pass a temporary ban on refugees from several Middle Eastern states. This last action met with widespread criticism, and the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed it as unconstitutional. On June 26, the Supreme Court overturned the 9th Circuit's decision, ruling that part of President Trump's executive order is constitutional. One of Trump's major accomplishments was nominating Associate Justice Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. On April 10, Gorsuch was sworn in. In 2018, President Trump nominated Brett Kavanaugh to replace the departing Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy. The nomination process soon became contentious after several women, most notably Palo Alto University psychology professor Christine Blasey Ford, accused Kavanaugh of past instances of sexual assault. After a series of hearings, the U.S. Senate voted to confirm Kavanaugh despite the controversy.

In December 2017, Congress passed and President Trump signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The Act amended the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 based on tax reform advocated by congressional Republicans and the Trump administration. Major elements include reducing tax rates for businesses and individuals; a personal tax simplification by increasing the standard deduction and family tax credits, but eliminating personal exemptions and making it less beneficial to itemize deductions; limiting deductions for state and local income taxes (SALT) and property taxes; further limiting the mortgage interest deduction; reducing the alternative minimum tax for individuals and eliminating it for corporations; reducing the number of estates impacted by the estate tax; and repealing the individual mandate of the Affordable Care Act (ACA).CBO-Reconciliation Recommendations of the Senate Committee on Finance-November 26, 2017 The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) reported that, under the Act, individuals and pass-through entities like partnerships and S corporations would receive about $1,125billion in net benefits (i.e. net tax cuts offset by reduced healthcare subsidies) over 10 years, while corporations would receive around $320billion in benefits. The individual and pass-through tax cuts fade over time and become net tax increases starting in 2027 while the corporate tax cuts are permanent. This enabled the Senate to pass the bill with only 51 votes, without the need to defeat a filibuster, under the budget reconciliation process.CBO-Cost Estimate for the Conference Agreement on H.R. 1 ‚Äì December 15, 2017 Tax cuts were reflected in individual worker paychecks as early as February 2018 and with the corporate tax rate being reduced from 35% to 21%, numerous major American corporations announced across-the-board pay raises and bonuses for their workers, expanded benefits and programs, and investments in capital improvements.Doug Wead, Inside Trump's White House: The Real Story of His Presidency (2019)Mara Oliva and Mark Shanahan, eds., The Trump Presidency: From Campaign Trail to World Stage (2018) President Trump signs the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act into law on 6 March 2020. On May 9, 2018, the Trump Administration withdrew from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) (also known as the Iran Nuclear Deal) with Iran, and other Great Powers, over alleged violations of the agreement by the Iranians in regards toward their nuclear program. The effects of the tax cuts resulted in the U.S. economy stabilizing for a short period between early 2018 and September 2019. During that time, the 2018 midterm elections took place. The elections had the highest voter turnout of any midterm election since 1914; the Democratic Party regained majority control of the House of Representatives and the Republican Party expanded their majority in the Senate even though they received a minority of the popular vote. In October 2019, the Federal Reserve announced that it would conduct a repurchase agreement operation to provide funds in the repo markets after the overnight lending rates spiked well above the Fed's target rate during the week of September 16. At that time, the United States began to feel the effects of a global synchronized economic slowdown that began after global growth peaked in 2017 and industrial output started to decline in 2018. The IMF blamed 'heightened trade and geopolitical tensions' as the main reason for the slowdown, citing Brexit and the China‚ÄìUnited States trade war as primary reasons for slowdown in 2019, while other economists blamed liquidity issues. On December 18, 2019, the House of Representatives brought forth two articles of impeachment (abuse of power and obstruction of Congress) against President Trump. Both articles were passed, impeaching Trump. Trump is the third President in American history to be impeached, after Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton. Protesters hold various signs and banners at a DACA rally in San Francisco. On December 20, 2019, Trump signed the 2020 National Defense Authorization Act, establishing the United States Space Force as the sixth armed service branch, with Air Force General John \\"Jay\\" Raymond, the head of Air Force Space Command and U.S. Space Command, becoming the first Chief of Space Operations. On January 3, 2020, President Trump responded to an attack on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad by ordering a drone strike against the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps's commanding general Qasem Soleimani and the PMF leader Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis at Baghdad International Airport. The incident sharply escalated a period of already strong tensions with Iran and lead to missile strikes on U.S. military forces in Iraq on January 8, 2020. At the same time, Iranian military forces mistakenly shot down Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752, leading to domestic unrest and international condemnation. In June 2020 the Supreme Court ruled against the Trump administration's order to rescind DACA, saying the administration had not provided adequate reasoning under the Administrative Procedure Act. DACA is a United States immigration policy that allows some individuals with unlawful presence in the United States after being brought to the country as children to receive a renewable two-year period of deferred action from deportation and become eligible for a work permit in the U.S. To be eligible for the program, recipients cannot have felonies or serious misdemeanors on their records. Unlike the proposed DREAM Act, DACA does not provide a path to citizenship for recipients. Race The mid-2010s have seen the return of racial unrest, and has seen the continued growth of racial polarization, white nationalism, and a deterioration of race relations in the U.S.. \\"A Post-Racial Nation\\" Outgoing President Barack Obama and President-elect Donald Trump in the Oval Office on November 10, 2016 Some Americans saw the presidential candidacy of Barack Obama, and his election in 2008 as the first black president of the United States, as a sign that the nation had, in fact, become post-racial. The conservative radio host Lou Dobbs, for example, said in November 2009, \\"We are now in a 21st-century post-partisan, post-racial society.\\" Two months later, Chris Matthews, an MSNBC host, said of President Obama, \\"He is post-racial by all appearances. You know, I forgot he was black tonight for an hour.\\" However, public opinion on whether the United States is post-racial is itself divided starkly by race. In a Washington Post/ABC News poll conducted in December 2014, about 50% of white respondents said they believed that the justice system treats Americans of all races equally, but only 10% of African Americans said the same. In the spring of 2015, according to a Gallup poll, 13 percent of black Americans surveyed identified race relations as the most important problem the United States faces, compared with 4 percent of white Americans. \\"All Lives Matter\\" sign at a rally in Portland, Oregon, on June 4, 2017 Arguments that the United States is not post-racial frequently emphasize the treatment of African Americans and other racial minorities in the criminal justice system and in interactions with the police. Killings of unarmed African Americans, often by police officers, have been widely publicized. In 2015, according to a study by The Guardian, police officers in the United States killed 7.13 black Americans per million, compared with 2.91 white Americans per million. Additionally: George Floyd protest, 2020-05-28, Columbus, Ohio. Such killings had a marked effect on public perceptions of race relations in America. The 13 percent of black Americans who called race relations the most pressing problem in the United States in the spring 2015 Gallup poll dwarfed the 3 percent that Gallup reported at the beginning of 2014. And the percentage of white Americans who said race relations were the most important issue rose to 4 percent in 2015 from 1 percent in 2014. In response to high-profile incidents such as the fatal shootings of Michael Brown, Aiyana Jones, Trayvon Martin, Laquan McDonald, Tamir Rice, and Walter Scott, and the death of Freddie Gray from a spinal-cord injury sustained in police custody, academics and journalists have denounced claims that America is post-racial. Ta-Nehisi Coates wrote in The Atlantic in 2015 that the phrase ‚Äúpost-racial‚Äù was ‚Äúusually employed by talk-show hosts and news anchors looking to measure progress in the Obama era.‚Äù And Anna Holmes wrote in The New York Times, \\"Chattel slavery and the legacies it left behind continue to shape American society. Sometimes it seems as if the desire for a ‚Äòpost- racial‚Äô America is an attempt by white people to liberate themselves from the burden of having to deal with that legacy.\\" Blue Lives Matter American flags emblazon a coffee house in Boise, Idaho. 200x200px However, others argue that post-racial politics champions aggressive action to deliver economic opportunity and weed out police misconduct, without the divisive framing of racial identity. Under this view, there is no claim that America has attained a fully post-racial society, however it is argued that news selection is skewed toward amplifying racial conflict, events demonstrating racial harmony are dismissed as non-newsworthy, and that such media conflict-bias acts to undermine trust and impede progress. Rather, any true measure of race relations must gauge the everyday daily experiences of Americans in interacting with people of differing backgrounds. An assumption is that the media will cherry-pick the most outrageous, racially-inflammatory events to cover no matter how infrequently they are occurring, and thus misreport progress toward a post-racial ideal. The central tenet of post-racial problem- solving practice is to seek the \\"alternative explanation\\" when conflict arises (presuming non-racist motives in others), in order to find common ground and creatively resolve the conflict. Examples of post-racial framing in attacking misconduct by the Criminal Justice System are video recording of all police- citizen interactions, creating a Citizens Review Board with investigative powers, and assigning an independent prosecutor. Or, in the educational sphere, creating charters, academies and school choice to turn around under- performing schools. The divide in public opinion on the status of race in America was reflected in reactions to the Black Lives Matter movement. In response to the \\"black lives matter\\" rallying cry, some people, including politicians, began using the phrase \\"all lives matter\\". After a sheriff's deputy in Harris County, Texas, was fatally shot while pumping gas in August, Sheriff Ron Hickman claimed that the rhetoric of Black Lives Matter activists had contributed to the killing and said, \\"We‚Äôve heard 'black lives matter'. All lives matter. Well, cops‚Äô lives matter, too. So why don't we just drop the qualifier and just say 'lives matter', and take that to the bank.' Supporters of the Black Lives Matter movement criticized the \\"all lives matter\\" phrase, arguing that it minimized the systemic threats faced by African Americans. President Obama said in October, \\"There is a specific problem that is happening in the African-American community that‚Äôs not happening in other communities.\\" Andrew Rosenthal wrote, similarly, in The New York Times, \\"The point of 'Black Lives Matter' is that the lives of African-Americans have come under special and deadly threat since before the birth of this country.\\" Evidence of continued racial divisions in the United States can also be found in demographics. For instance, African Americans account for less than 15 percent of the total population of Michigan, but more than 82 percent of the population of the state's largest city, Detroit ‚Äî and Detroit, like many cities whose residents are predominantly black, has \\"self-segregated schools, dwindling tax bases and decaying public services\\".

George Floyd protests in Portland, Oregon, July 2020 Even after the end of the crack epidemic, there remained a large disparity in crime rates between black people and whites, with black people accounting for 28% of arrests in 2013; over 50% of homicides and robberies where the race of the offender was known were committed by black suspects. As most crime is intraracial, most of their victims were black as well, and crime remained concentrated within black communities. Due to high crime rates, many inner city areas were heavily policed, often by police forces drawn from the population of the greater urban area rather than the local, primarily black, population, resulting in many black people feeling that they were being discriminated against by law enforcement. By 2009, black people accounted for 39.4% of the prison population in the United States. The incarceration rate of black males was over six times higher than that of white males, with a rate of 4,749 per 100,000 U.S. residents.Prison Inmates at Midyear 2009 - Statistical Tables ‚Äì US Bureau of Justice Statistics, published June 2010.

A memorial service is held for five Dallas police officers who were killed during a protest against police shootings in July 2016. In August 2014, Darren Wilson, a white policeman in Ferguson, Missouri shot and killed Michael Brown, an 18-year-old unarmed black man who had robbed a nearby convenience store fifteen minutes earlier. While a grand jury investigation found that Wilson had acted in self-defense after Brown attacked him on two separate occasions, locals hostile to the police claimed that Brown had been gunned down while surrendering. Racial tensions in Ferguson between the mainly black population and mainly white police force led to both peaceful protests and riots, and several buildings were looted and set on fire. In response, the Ferguson Police Department deployed military-grade riot gear and riot control weaponry to disperse crowds and maintain order. Further protests erupted after the death of Eric Garner, a 43-year-old black resident of Staten Island, New York who died after being put in a nineteen-second long chokehold by NYPD officer Daniel Pantaleo while resisting arrest. Garner was being investigated by the NYPD under suspicion of illegally selling cigarettes. Pantaleo's acquittal by a grand jury in December led to nationwide protests by a movement which came to call itself Black Lives Matter. George Floyd protests in Washington DC. H St. Lafayette Square. As media coverage of police shootings intensified, protests erupted in the wake of the July 5, 2016 shooting of Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and the July 6 shooting of Philando Castile in Falcon Heights, Minnesota. On July 7, towards the end of one of these protests in Dallas, Texas, Micah Xavier Johnson ambushed and fired upon a group of police officers, killing five officers and injuring nine others. Two civilians were also wounded. Johnson was an Army Reserve Afghan War veteran who was reportedly angry over police shootings of black men and stated that he wanted to kill white people, especially white police officers. Following the shooting, Johnson fled inside a building on the campus of El Centro College. Police followed him there, and a standoff ensued. In the early hours of July 8, police killed Johnson with a bomb attached to a remote control bomb disposal robot. It was the first time U.S. law enforcement used a robot to kill a suspect. The shooting was the deadliest incident for U.S. law enforcement officers since the September 11 attacks in 2001 and saw a massive uprising of public support for U.S. police officers in the form of the Blue Lives Matter movement. The George Floyd protests and riots against police brutality that began as local protests in the Minneapolis‚ÄìSaint Paul metropolitan area of Minnesota before spreading throughout the United States and then worldwide. The protests began in Minneapolis on May 26, 2020, following the killing of George Floyd, in which Minneapolis Police Department officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck for over eight minutes‚Äîassisted by three other police‚Äîafter pinning the handcuffed man to the ground during an arrest the previous day. Protests quickly spread across the United States and internationally in support of Black Lives Matter. At least twelve major cities declared a curfew on the evening of Saturday, May 30, and as of June 2, governors in 24 states and Washington, D.C, had called in the National Guard, with over 17,000 troops activated. Unite the Right rally Robert E. Lee monument in New Orleans being lowered Removal of Confederate monuments and memorials, May 19, 2017 Protesters at the Unite the Right rally carrying Confederate flags, Gadsden flags, and a Nazi flag On August 13, 2017, Trump condemned violence \\"on many sides\\" after a gathering of hundreds of white nationalists in Charlottesville, Virginia, the previous day (August 12) turned deadly. A white supremacist drove a car into a crowd of counter-protesters, killing one woman, Heather Heyer, and injuring 19 others. According to Attorney General Jeff Sessions, that action met the definition of domestic terrorism. During the rally there had been other violence, as some counter- protesters charged at the white nationalists with swinging clubs and mace, throwing bottles, rocks, and paint.Costello, Tom. \\"Charlottesville Fact Check: Were Both Sides To Blame For Violence?\\" Today Show (August 16, 2016).Gunter, Joel. \\"What Trump Said Versus What I Saw\\", BBC News (August 16, 2017).Alexander, Harriet. \\"What is the 'alt Left' that Donald Trump said was 'very violent' in Charlottesville?\\", The Telegraph (August 16, 2017): \\"photos and videos from Saturday's riot does show people dressed in black, their faces covered, engaging the neo-Nazis in violent confrontation.\\" Trump did not expressly mention Neo-Nazis, white supremacists, or the alt-right movement in his remarks on August 13, but the following day (August 14) he did denounce white supremacists as he had done as a candidate the previous year.Scott, Eugene. \\"Trump denounces David Duke, KKK\\", CNN (March 3, 2016).Nakamura, David. \\"Trump denounces KKK, neo-Nazis as 'repugnant' as he seeks to quell criticism of his response to Charlottesville\\", The Washington Post (August 14, 2017). He condemned \\"the KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and other hate groups\\". Then the next day (August 15), he again blamed \\"both sides\\". Many Republican and Democratic elected officials condemned the violence and hatred of white nationalists, neo-Nazis and alt-right activists. Trump came under criticism from world leaders and politicians, as well as a variety of religious groups and anti-hate organizations for his remarks, which were seen as muted and equivocal. The New York Times reported that Trump \\"was the only national political figure to spread blame for the 'hatred, bigotry and violence' that resulted in the death of one person to 'many sides, and said that Trump had \\"buoyed the white nationalist movement on Tuesday as no president has done in generations\\". White nationalist groups felt \\"emboldened\\" after the rally and planned additional demonstrations.

COVID-19 pandemic A medical technician assigned to the 151st Medical Group, conducts a COVID-19 test on a member of the Utah National Guard at a supply warehouse, May 14, 2020 In January 2020, the first cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were found in the United States. There have been subsequent mass temporary business closures and self-quarantine efforts across the country. Fears about the impending global spread of the disease were the primary cause of a stock market crash which began in late February 2020. The broader economy in the U.S. has also been greatly impacted. The hospital ship USNS Comfort arrives in Manhattan. On February 25 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warned the American public for the first time to prepare for a local outbreak. A national emergency was declared by President Trump on March 13. In early March, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) began allowing public health agencies and private companies to develop and administer tests, and loosened restrictions so anyone with a doctor's order could be tested. By the end of the month, more than a million people had been tested (1 per 320 inhabitants). The Trump administration largely waited until mid-March to start purchasing large quantities of medical equipment. In late March, the administration started to use the Defense Production Act to direct industries to produce medical equipment. Federal health inspectors who surveyed hospitals in late March found shortages of test supplies, personal protective equipment (PPE), and other resources due to extended patient stays while awaiting test results. By early May, the U.S. had processed around 6.5 million tests, and was conducting around 250,000 tests per day, but experts said this level of testing was still not enough to contain the outbreak. By April 11, the federal government approved disaster declarations for all states and inhabited territories except American Samoa. State and local responses to the outbreak have included prohibitions and cancellation of large-scale gatherings (including festivals and sporting events), stay-at-home orders, and the closure of schools. Disproportionate numbers of cases have been observed among Black and Latino populations. A second rise of infections began in June 2020, primarily driven by relaxed restrictions in several states, primarily, but not all Southern, including Alabama, South Carolina, Florida, Texas, Arizona and Arkansas, among others. By July 17, 2020, New York State ranked first in the most confirmed COVID-19 cases at over 400,000 followed by California with 350,000 and was one of the first states to have a case in January 2020, but New York was the global epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in the nation's first peak in March and April before their curve was lowered, while California surged in the second peak in June and July.

New York: Oxford University Press, 1993.Keck, Leander E. 1996. The New Interpreter's Bible: Volume: VII. Nashville: Abingdon. Text The original text was written in Hebrew language. This chapter is divided into 14 verses. Textual witnesses Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter in Hebrew are of the Masoretic Text, which includes the Codex Cairensis (895), the Petersburg Codex of the Prophets (916), Aleppo Codex (10th century), Codex Leningradensis (1008). There is also a translation into Koine Greek known as the Septuagint, made in the last few centuries BCE. Extant ancient manuscripts of the Septuagint version include Codex Vaticanus (B; \\\\mathfrak{G}B; 4th century), Codex Sinaiticus (S; BHK: \\\\mathfrak{G}S; 4th century), Codex Alexandrinus (A; \\\\mathfrak{G}A; 5th century) and Codex Marchalianus (Q; \\\\mathfrak{G}Q; 6th century). Verse 1 : The burden of the word of the Lord to Israel by Malachi. * \\"By Malachi\\": literally, by the hand of Malachi (comp. Jeremiah 37:2). Malachi is the proper name of the prophet, and not a mere official designation. The LXX. renders, ·ºêŒΩ œáŒµŒπœÅ·Ω∂ ·ºÄŒ≥Œ≥Œ≠ŒªŒøœÖ Œ±·ΩêœÑŒø·ø¶, \\"by the hand of his angel,\\" or \\"messenger,\\" and some curious theories have been founded on this translation; e.g. that an angel was the real author of the book, or an angel came and explained it to the people. Haggai is also called \\"The Lord's Messenger\\" (Haggai 1:13). At the end of the verse the LXX. adds, \\"fix it in your hearts,\\" which according Jerome was imported from Haggai 2:15. Verse 2 : I have loved you, saith the Lord. Yet ye say, Wherein hast thou loved us? Was not Esau Jacob's brother? saith the Lord: yet I loved Jacob, * \\"I have loved you\\": this is said in comparison to other nations, even above the other descendants of Abraham and Isaac; the statement is 'left unexpressed, sorrow as it were breaking off the sentence' (; Hosea 11:1).Robert Jamieson, Andrew Robert Fausset; David Brown. Jamieson, Fausset, and Brown's Commentary On the Whole Bible. 1871. Verse 3 : And I hated Esau, and laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness. * \\"I hated Esau\\": Paul quotes these words in Romans 9:13 to illustrate his position, \\"that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth.\\" Even before his birth Jacob was the chosen one, and Esau, the elder, was to serve the younger. However, Malachi is not speaking of the predestination of the one brother and the reprobation of the other; he is contrasting the histories of the two peoples represented by them, that both nations sinned; both are punished; but Israel by God's free mercy was forgiven and restored, while Edom was left in the misery for its iniquity, thus proving God's love for the Israelites.Joseph S. Exell; Henry Donald Maurice Spence-Jones (Editors). The Pulpit Commentary. 23 volumes. First publication: 1890. * \\"Laid his mountains\\": According to Grotius, it was done by Nebuchadnezzar five years after the captivity of the Jews, in fulfillment of the prophecy of Jeremiah (Jeremiah 49:7) or this could be done by the Nabatheans.See Prideaux's Connexion, par. 2. B. 3. p. 199.

Ed. 2.John Gill. John Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible. Exposition of the Old and New Testament.

It has been credited as the first conference for African-American lesbian women.Kyper, John. \\"Black Lesbians Meet in October.\\" Coming Up: A Calendar of Events 1 (Oct. 1980): 1. Web.  History  Before the \\"First Black Lesbian conference,\\" several important historical events took place in the United States, which affected African Americans and lesbian women and their ability to disclose their sexual orientation. These events included the Stonewall riots and the civil rights movement which ultimately increased the importance of the Black lesbian conference. The impacts of the Stonewall riots and the Civil Rights Movement created an enormous amount of oppression surrounding the black lesbian community. The Civil Rights Movement was particularly important as the sexual identity of lesbian participants remained invisible throughout the movement.Haggerty, George, and Bonnie Zimmerman. Encyclopedia of Lesbian and Gay Histories and Cultures. Taylor & Francis, 2003. Print. The 1969 Stonewall Rebellion ultimately affected the visibility of African American lesbians and their struggle with oppression while emerging in the feminist movement. The ‚ÄúFirst Black Lesbian Conference‚Äù was an outgrowth from the First National Third World Lesbian and Gay Conference by the National Coalition of Black Lesbians and Gays which was held in 1979, in Washington, DC. Although there had been previous conferences supporting both lesbians and gays, the ‚ÄúFirst Black Lesbian Conference‚Äù was the first in the United States with the mission to hold a conference with the sole focus of supporting African- Americans lesbians.Daniels, Gabrielle. ‚ÄúFirst Black Lesbian Conference.‚Äù Off Our Backs 10.11 (1980): 4‚Äì8. Print. In the decades leading to the conference, it was not uncommon for other various organizations to push African-American lesbian women out, as a result of the lack of knowledge surrounding diversity of sexual orientation and race.Springer, Kimberly. Living for the Revolution: Black Feminist Organizations, 1968‚Äì1980. Duke University Press, 2005. Print.  Agenda  The \\"First Black Lesbian Conference\\" was a 2-day event, which was open to all African-American lesbian women, and was held at The Women's Building in San Francisco. The event was attended by over 200 women from across the United States.Myers, JoAnne. The A to Z of the Lesbian Liberation Movement: Still the Rage. Scarecrow Press, 2009. The purpose of the conference was to create a National network for African-American women, affirm individuality, to reach African-American lesbian women in isolated areas, and to provide education.GLBT Historical Society. The Gay Life. N.p. Audio Recording. Accessed February 1, 2017. <http://archive.org/details/TheGayLife>. The women came together at the conference to provide support, encouragement, and strength to bring awareness to issues and hardships which the members experienced and felt were important. The theme surrounding the event was ‚Äúbecoming visible,‚Äù as many lesbian African Americans had been struggling with sexism, racism, and homophobia for several decades. These struggles ultimately affected the ability of African American lesbians to self-disclose their sexual orientation. The conference was an opportunity for African-American lesbians to express these concerns and struggles and to ultimately create a national network and support system for all African-American lesbians throughout the United States.\\"Black Lesbians to Meet Oct. 17 in SF.\\" Demeter: Women's News of the Monterey Bay Area (Oct. 1980): 5. CSUMB Digital Commons. Web. 23 Feb. 2017.  Notable Speakers  Prominent activists in the African- American Lesbian Liberation Movement were keynote speakers for the \\"First Black Lesbian Conference.\\" These speakers included Andrea Ruth Canaan, Pat Norman, and Angela Davis.Cassell, Heather. ‚ÄúThe Bay Area Reporter Online  Black Lesbians Display their Sapphic History.‚Äù Bay Area Reporter. N.p., n.d. Web. 21 Feb. 2017. Each keynote speaker of the conference addressed relevant topics relating to strengths and oppressions faced through the struggles of African-American lesbians. Andrea Canaan, a notable black lesbian feminist, stressed in her speech the importance of both invisibility and visibility and the resulting responsibilities and purpose with \\"becoming visible.\\" Through Canaan's speech, she ultimately presented how becoming more prominent in society could be either powerful or dangerous to the African American lesbian population. Pat Norman, a notable activist for the LGBT community, and also a keynote speaker for the conference, expanded on Canaan's speech. As a coordinator for Gay Health Services for San Francisco's Public Health Department, a founder of the Lesbians Mothers' Union, and also a board member of the National Gay Task Force, Norman contributed her personal experience and understanding of how internalized racism is damaging to the emergence and support for African-American lesbians from the general population. During this period, Internalized racism was a prominent form of oppression experienced by African-American lesbian women. Internalized racism not only affected the emergence of African-Americans, but also lead to African-American lesbians to expecting a certain behavior from one another, and shaped the definition of African-American culture.  Events and Workshops  The 2-day event of the \\"First Black Lesbian Conference\\" held 8 workshops for attendees which included: * Business and Money Management, * Lesbians and the Law, * Feminism, * African American Women Role Models in the Arts, led by Sabrina Sojourner * Wellness Counseling, * Health Issues and African Americans, * African Americans and Imperialism, led by Pat Parker * Interracial Relationships.  Entertainment  The conference encompassed entertainment through poetry readings, dance, and music and was open to all of the gay community in the San Francisco Bay Area. The event held choreographed dance performances by M. Lambert-Van Buuren, who choreographed performed dances named \\"Morning Dance\\" and \\"Primal Roots,\\" for the attendees of the conference. The conference also featured musical performances by Gwen Avery, Casselberry-Dupree, and Avotcja.

It protects a mountainous area in the Atlantic Forest biome, an important source of water in a dry region, and a potential source of tourism revenue in an area with many social problems. Location The Serra Negra State Park is in the municipality of Itamarandiba, Minas Gerais in the districts of Padre Jo√£o Afonso, Santa Joana and Santa Luzia de Minas. It has an area of . The perimeter is marked but not enclosed. The park is from the municipal seat. It is from Belo Horizonte. The park covers part of the Espinha√ßo Mountains. These are recognized by UNESCO as one of the world's biosphere reserves. An internal road leads to the former transmission tower of TV Leste on one of the highest points of the region at . From this point there is an extensive view of the surrounding mountains. The park is in the Jequitinhonha River basin, and contains the sources of many watercourses that feed that river, the Ara√ßua√≠ River and tributaries of the Doce River. History The Serra Negra State Park was created by decree 39.907 of 22 September 1998. Objectives included protecting a large number of water sources of vital importance in the dry Upper Jequitinhonha region, protecting biological diversity in the Atlantic Forest, rocky field, cerrado and gallery forest ecosystems, reducing the impact of charcoal production and encouraging ecotourism in a region with severe social problems. The park is part of the Espinha√ßo Mosaic of conservation units. In the dry season of 2007 a major fire swept through much of the park, but the vegetation is gradually regenerating. In April 2013, the Public Ministry and Justice department of Minas Gerais charged that the State Forestry Institute had been failing to comply with environmental legislation. There were serious problems such as lack of a management plan, physical structures and personnel, and land tenure issues with the ecological stations of Mata do Acau√£ and Mata dos Ausentes and the state parks of Biribiri, Alto Cariri, Rio Preto and Serra Negra. Environment The park is in the Atlantic Forest biome, with large remnants of the original vegetation preserved in areas that are hard to access and in some lowland areas. Tree species include cedro (cedrus sp.), bra√∫na (Schinopsis brasiliensis), ip√™ (Tabebuia sp.), peroba (Aspidosperma spruceanum), jacarand√° (Jacaranda sp.) and vinh√°tico (Plathymenia). Large stands of canela-de-ema (Vellozia squamata) can be found in the mountains and in areas with sandy soil, reaching over in height. There are several endemic species of grasses, and high levels of endemism for ferns, orchids and velozias. The park is mostly surrounded by eucalyptus plantations and pastures. Fauna is diversified and includes locally rare or endangered species such as lobo guar√°, guigor, barbado ou guariba, su√ßuarana, catitu and jaguatirica. Other species include paca, capivara, quati, tatu, roedores diversos, veado and tei√∫. Visiting The park is lacking infrastructure. There is partial control of visits in one part of the park, open 8:30 to 17:30 daily. Visits must be pre-arranged with the park administration. Tourist attractions include lookouts, orchids, caves and many waterfalls. Some work has been done in environmental education in the schools and communities around the park. Volunteer fire brigades have been trained, environmental awareness signs erected and gazebos and ecological trails developed. However, lack of infrastructure and the impact of human activities remain challenges.

Geography  The locality of Kogan is shaped like an upside-down U with the locality of Beelbee almost enclosed by Kogan. The town of Kogan is in the north-west of the locality. From the town there are four arterial roads: * Kogan Condamine Road towards the north-west to Montrose and eventually to Condamine * Warra Kogan Road towards the north-east to Warra * Dalby Kogan Road towards the south-east to Macalister and eventually to Dalby * Tara Kogan Road towards the south-west to Tara In the north-east of the locality, the Condamine River flows from south to north along Kogan's boundary with Warra, while Wilkie Creek flowing from south to north (a tributary of the Condamine) forms Kogan's boundary with Macalister. Wambo Creek flows from south to north-west through the south-western part of the locality and is eventually a tributary of the Condamine River. Kogan Creek flows from south to north through the locality passing through the township of Kogan; it is also a tributary of the Condamine River. The lower flatter land in Kogan (approx 350 metres above sea level) is used for grazing, while higher peaks of approx 400metres remain as bushland. Most of Kogan is freehold land with the exceptions of Dalby State Forest, Braemer State Forest, both in the eastern part of the locality. Geologically, Kogan is part of the Surat Basin.  History  The name Kogan derives from an early pastoral run called Kogan Creek owned variously by J.E. Barney (-1848), Joseph King (1838-1849), and Colin J. McKenzie (1849-). The name probably comes from Kogai, one of the Aboriginal tribes from the district. It was a changing station on the Dalby- Roma coach route prior to the construction of the Western railway line. It had a hotel, the Kogan Inn, at that time, but this closed after the demise of the coach route. Kogan Provisional School opened on 4 October 1897 and closed about 1899. It reopened in 1905 and became Kogan State School in 1910. Kogan North State School opened on 18 June 1936 and closed on 30 April 1944. The Wilkie Creek coal mine commenced operation in 1994. It was bought by Peabody Energy in 2002. In the 2011 census, Kogan had a population of 355 people.  Economy  All of Kogan and Beelbee are subject to petroleum leases and there are many coal seam gas wells in south-east Kogan with associated pipelines. The Wilkie Creek coal mine is located on the eastern boundary of the locality (). It is an open cut mine producing a thermal coal that is low in nitrogen and sulphur. The coal is then taken by rail to the Port of Brisbane from where it is taken by ship to Asia where it is used in power generation. The Darling Downs Power Station and the Braemer Power Station are both located in Kogan.  Education  Kogan State School is a government co-educational primary school (P-6) at High Street. In 2015, there were 47 students enrolled with 3 teachers (2 full-time equivalent). It opened in October 1897.  Hugh Sawrey  Australian painter Hugh Sawrey spent many years in the Kogan area. He often painted murals on local buildings to pay his bills. He first visited the town after he returned from military service in World War II, seeking work on cattle stations. He painted murals for the lounge of the Kogan Hotel and the ceiling of the Kogan post office. In 2009 a documentary was made about Sawrey titled Banjo Paterson with a Paintbrush. On 3 October 2009, the documentary premiered at the Art at Kogan festival in the presence of the Queensland Governor, Penelope Wensley. Sawrey is commemorated in Kogan with a sculpture and walkway. The sculpture titled Bush Friendship is on the Kogan-Condamine Road () and features Sawrey with his friend Nelson \\"Darkie\\" Dwyer, the former publican in Kogan. It is a lifesize sculpture in bronze and depicts the two men sitting across a table from one another, playing cards (as they often did). The sculpture forms part of the Hugh Sawrey Walk of Fame, which was funded by the Queensland Government as part of the Q150 celebrations. A sculpture of a horse with a rugged stockman on his back and the whip cutting up above his head (themes that Sawrey often painted) forms the entrance to the Kogan Community Centre.

Her two monographs are in the journal, Journalism & Communication Monographs, which is an official publication of the Association of Education in Journalism and Mass Communication (AEJMC). These monographs touch on some of her main research topics. In her article, \\"Global media events in India: Contests over beauty, gender, and nation,\\" Parameswaran studied how global beauty pageants affect non-western countries. The theory of cultural imperialism suggests that dominant western ideals can overtake other nations. Parameswaran shows that the relationship is more complicated. Local national and regional ideals can get woven into global ideals, allowing both sides to influence each other's values, and standards. Gender, beauty standards, and cultural politics also show that intersectionality shapes flows of western culture to non-western locations. In the other monograph, \\"Melanin on the margins: Advertising and the cultural politics of fair/light/white beauty in India\\", Parameswaran and Cardoza studied how companies advertise and entice women to buy skin lightening products. Many magazines and advertisements in India show that light skin is beautiful and they reinforce that normative expectation, particularly for Indian women. Hierarchies of race, gender, caste, ethnicity, and class modify and create spaces of privilege and marginalization within beauty culture.

New York: Oxford University Press, 1993.Keck, Leander E. 1996. The New Interpreter's Bible: Volume: VII. Nashville: Abingdon. Text The original text was written in Hebrew language. This chapter is divided into 18 verses. Masoretic Texts regard the six verses of chapter 4 as a part of chapter 3, making the total of 24 verses. Textual witnesses Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter in Hebrew are of the Masoretic Text, which includes the Codex Cairensis (895), the Petersburg Codex of the Prophets (916), Aleppo Codex (10th century), Codex Leningradensis (1008). Fragments containing parts of this chapter were found among the Dead Sea Scrolls, including 4Q76 (4QXIIa; 150‚Äì125 BCE) with extant verses 1‚Äì18 (and verses 3:19‚Äì24 in Masoretic Text);Dead sea scrolls - Malachi and 4Q78 (4QXIIc; 75‚Äì50 BCE) with a extant verses 6‚Äì7?.

Verse 1 : Behold, I will send my messenger, :: and he shall prepare the way before me: : and the Lord, whom ye seek, :: shall suddenly come to his temple, : even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in: :: behold, he shall come, saith the Lord of hosts. * \\"Behold, I will send (I send) my messenger\\": God answers that he is coming to show himself the God of judgment and justice. Are they ready to meet him and to bear his sentence? Who this \\"messenger\\" is disputed. That no angel or heavenly visitant is meant is clear from historical considerations, as no such event took place immediately before the Lord came to his temple. Nor can Malachi himself be intended, as his message was delivered nearly four hundred years before Messiah came. The announcement is doubtless founded upon Isaiah 40:3, and refers to the same person as the older prophet mentions, who is generally allowed to be John the Baptist, the herald of Christ's advent (Matthew 11:10; John 1:6).Joseph S. Exell; Henry Donald Maurice Spence-Jones (Editors). The Pulpit Commentary. 23 volumes. First publication: 1890. * \\"Prepare the way before me\\" The expression is borrowed from Isaiah 40:3 (comp. also Isaiah 57:14; Isaiah 62:10). He prepares the way by preaching repentance, and thus removing the obstacle of sin which stood between God and his people. Luke 1:76. The prophecy on John the Baptist's birth: \\"Thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest, for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare His way, to give knowledge of salvation unto His people, for the remission of their sins.\\" Repentance was to be the preparation for the kingdom of Christ, the Messiah, for whom they looked so impatiently.Barnes, Albert.

This is the person himself speaking, the Son of God, and promised Messiah, the Lord of all men, and particularly of his church and people, in right of marriage, by virtue of redemption, and by being their Head and King; so Kimchi and Ben Melech interpret it of him, and even Abarbinel himself;Mashmiah Jeshuah, fol. 76. 4. the Messiah that had been so long spoken of and so much expected, and whom the Jews sought after, either in a scoffing manner, expressed in the above question, or rather seriously; some as a temporal deliverer, to free them from the Roman yoke, and bring them into a state of liberty, prosperity, and grandeur; and others as a spiritual Saviour, to deliver from sin, law, hell, and death, and save them with an everlasting salvation.John Gill.

There was a literal fulfilment of this prophecy when Christ was presented in the temple as an infant (Luke 2:22, etc.). * \\"suddenly\\" ‚Äî This epithet marks the second coming, rather than the first; the earnest of that unexpected coming (Luke 12:38-46; Revelation 16:15) to judgment was given in the judicial expulsion of the money-changing profaners from the temple by Messiah (Matthew 21:12, 13), where also as here He calls the temple His temple.

Maurice of Orange with an Anglo-Dutch army besieged the Spanish held cities in part to distract them before their impending siege at Ostend. Rheinberg, an important city, eventually capitulated on 28 July after a Spanish relief force under Herman van den Bergh failed to relieve the city. The towns of Meurs surrendered soon after. Background In mid June 1601 Albert of Austria was in preparation to besiege the Anglo-Dutch held town of Ostend, and at the same time the States General demanded that the stadtholder Maurice of Orange should march to relieve the city. Francis Vere the English governor of Ostend was frustrated at the lack of Dutch response from both the States General and from Maurice; particularly when a few veteran English companies including Edward Cecil's, were taken out of Ostend to join Maurice's forces in the field.Dalton pp 75‚Äì76 Maurice however knowing the futility in making a direct attack, chose to campaign in the surrounding areas closer to the core of the Dutch Republic. The strategy that would be used was hoped to block Spanish supplies and divert the attention of the Spanish aiming to besiege Ostend.Belleroche p. 43 On 7 June Maurice camped his troops with a well appointed force of about 10,000 men and marched to the Rhine. Included in this force was an English army of 2,500 men under the temporary command of Lord Willoughby between Arnhem and Schenkenschans.Knight, Charles Raleigh: Historical records of The Buffs, East Kent Regiment (3rd Foot) formerly designated the Holland Regiment and Prince George of Denmark's Regiment. Vol I. London, Gale & Polden, 1905, p. 50 Targets included the Spanish held towns of Grave and 's-Hertogenbosch, but also Rheinberg which had changed hands four times since 1589, and the latter was chosen. Rheinberg had a large garrison of over 3,000 men, many of whom were crack troops from Spain under the experienced Don Luis Bernardo de Avila who had ample supplies for a long siege.Israel pp 29-30 Campaign Maurice of Orange On 10 June 1601 Maurice took to the field and two days later the Anglo-Dutch surrounded Rheinberg and soon siege works were dug and constructed around the town. Within a few days however Maurice had received orders to release almost 2,000 men including many of his veteran English and Scottish troops as reinforcements to Ostend. Disturbed by the calculations of his decreasing besieging force he hoped that the town would surrender before more troops were ordered away. On 29 June Henry Percy, 9th Earl of Northumberland and other nobles came to Rheinberg to learn the art of siege warfare. At the same time Earl placed himself in temporary command of the English forces which caused friction between himself and the English commander Lord Willoughby. On 5 July the siege of Ostend began and soon after Percy visited Ostend hoping to learn more, putting Lord Willoughby back in charge. Model of Meurs as it would have looked around 1600 Meanwhile, Count Herman van den Bergh had marched from Spanish Flanders with 5,000 men and 2,000 cavalry to try to relieve Rheinberg, but as he approached his leading elements probed the defences and found it well intact. After an attack was repelled and van den Bergh realised that the Anglo-Dutch force stood firm, he did not want to risk an open battle and decided to retreat leaving the garrison to its fate. Maurice's siege works proved effective - his pioneers sprang a mine under the Kassel gate. On 26 July the mine was detonated doing much damage and inflicting huge losses - according to one witness many were thrown into the air. Maurice persisted in his operations and three days later mines were placed elsewhere, which was eventually abandoned as Luis De Avila decided all hope was lost and surrendered on the 30th. After leaving a garrison in Rheinberg the following Maurice then marched South to Meurs. They laid siege to the city on 2 August 1601 which after a brief bombardment and no hope of relief the Spanish garrison almost immediately surrendered. Aftermath The victory was celebrated in Holland and a triumphal medal was created with the inscription; the enemy threatening fearful things is driven from Berg. Rheinberg, because it had been besieged many times throughout the war, became known as the whore of war. The place was next besieged in 1606 by Ambrogio Spinola in his campaign and was captured. Rheinberg remained in Spanish hands until 1632 when Frederick Henry retook the city which remained in Dutch hands.Knight, Charles Raleigh: Historical records of The Buffs, East Kent Regiment (3rd Foot) formerly designated the Holland Regiment and Prince George of Denmark's Regiment. Vol I. London, Gale & Polden, 1905, p. 117 The Dutch were determined to fortify both towns with their own troops, no longer trusting the neutrality of the German princes garrison. Thus the keys to the land of Cleves and Julliers the scene of the Francisco de Mendoza's successful and brutal campaign were now held by the stadholder. Maurice then sent more reinforcements to Ostend and halted further campaigning for two months. In November he tried to take 's-Hertogenbosch but the onset of a brutal cold winter and the threat of a Spanish relief force under Van den Bergh forced Maurice into winter quarters.Van Nimwegen pp.178-79 Meurs stayed in Dutch hands and would remain a part of the Dutch Republic until 1712 when it became a part of Prussia.

In this episode, the Evil Queen and Regina prepare to face each other once and for all, while Emma learns the truth about what Hook did, which comes into play for Gideon as he takes advantage of this dilemma. In the past, the real reason behind the Evil Queen's search for Snow White's heart is revealed. Plot Opening sequence The Dark Palace from the first curse Enchanted Forest is featured. Event chronology *The Enchanted Forest events take place after \\"Lost Girl\\" and before \\"Souls of the Departed\\". *The Storybrooke events take place after \\"Ill-Boding Patterns\\". In the Characters' Past In the pre-First Curse Enchanted Forest, Regina, during her reign as the Evil Queen, is still after Snow White's heart, and as usual, comes up empty-handed as Snow eludes her once again. The Evil Queen then gathers the villagers and tells them that she, not Snow White, cares about them. When Tinkerbell shows up to tell her why she did not pursue Robin Hood, Regina decides to scorn the fairy, but spares her and tells Tinkerbell not to meddle with her. This later leads to an argument between Regina and Prince Henry, who warns his daughter that revenge will never make her happy. Later on, Henry, with help from Tinkerbell, leads Regina to a portal that was designed to lead Regina to Robin, but the Queen is still obsessed with revenge, as she takes Cupid's arrow, and uses dark magic to make it pinpoint the person she hates most instead. However, when she fires the arrow, it flies straight towards the fortress. Believing that Snow is there, Regina returns to discover that the arrow leads her to her mirror, which she shatters into pieces. Regina realizes it is herself she hates most. In Storybrooke In the present day, the Evil Queen brings Robin back with her to town, he wants to go to New York but the Evil Queen wants to return Robin back to his Wish Realm, so she first asks him to dig up an item in the woods. Regina and Zelena then visit Emma and Snow, where they learn that Hook proposed to Emma upon looking at the engagement ring, but when they learn that the Evil Queen has returned to her original form, Emma wants to put those plans on hold. At the woods, Robin's shovel hits the metal box, which contained the Fate's Shears of Destiny, which the Evil Queen wants to use not only to separate her fate from Regina's, but to destroy Regina and Storybrooke. The Evil Queen then shows up to take Henry's Author's Pen, so she could keep Henry from writing her out of existence or interfering with her coming showdown with Regina. Then, after Henry reveals that he only wanted to use the Pen to help move her towards redemption, The Evil Queen scoffs at the idea. The Evil Queen then gives Henry a note to deliver to Regina, before telling him that no matter what anyone says, she still loves him. When Regina receives the message, she learns that the message came from Page 23 of the \\"Once Upon a Time\\" storybook that detailed the happy ending Regina never got, which Regina discovered that it all tied to Robin, who is being used as bait to lure her to the Evil Queen so she can kill her, even though Robin believes this plan will fail. Regina confronts her other half at the Mayor's office, but the Evil Queen tells Regina she's more interested in using the shears to destroy Regina rather than helping Robin. Regina dares the Evil Queen to use the Shears and the latter does, unveiling the ties of fate linking Regina to her evil half, which The Evil Queen severes with the Shears. This makes the Evil Queen completely independent of Regina, allowing the two to battle each other until Regina manages to overpower the Evil Queen, and binds her against a pillar on the wall. Then, Regina, after looking at the broken mirror and seeing how much she hated her evil self, displays the Evil Queen's heart to show her that she chooses to love over hate. Regina then transfers half of the Evil Queen's darkness into her heart, while transferring half of her light into the Evil Queen's heart, turning the two Reginas into bonding sisters who agree to bury the hatchet. The two agreed to send Robin back to his Wish Realm, and with help from Henry, he writes a new chapter and happy ending for the formerly Evil Queen by sending her off to a place to begin a fresh start. Meanwhile, Hook arrives at the docks to say farewell to Nemo, and confides his secret about killing Emma's grandfather to Nemo. Nemo suggests that Hook either ask for forgiveness from Emma or keep the secret and learn to forgive himself. Ultimately, Hook decides to remove his memories through magic and burn them. When Emma sees him doing this, she is not upset to learn he killed her grandfather, since they have come too far for something like that to break them; however, she is upset that Hook chose to keep it from her, as they had earlier in the season decided to no longer keep secrets from one other, in order to build a more honest relationship. Reluctantly, Emma passes back the ring and calls off the wedding until Hook can learn to do that. Later, Snow congratulates Hook on the engagement, not knowing about what transpired earlier. Unfortunately, just as Hook changes his mind and is about to leave Nautilus to return to Emma, the submarine submerges without Nemo ordering it to do so. Hook and Nemo learn that Gideon had ordered the sub out of Storybrooke, in order to get Hook out of the way so he can kill Emma, leaving Hook and Nemo trapped as prisoners. A hurt Emma waits at home for Hook, and realizing he won't be returning, shuts off the lights. In the Wish Realm The Queen sends Robin back home after his many pleas to leave Storybrooke. Later, as the Queen wishes for a fresh start, she is sent to the Wish Realm, where she reunites with Robin in a local bar. True to the image on Page 23, a bond begins to blossom.

In this episode, Gideon's past with the Black Fairy and his vengeance towards his grandmother is revealed, as Gideon blackmails Emma into defeating the Black Fairy in order to return Hook back to Storybrooke. Meanwhile Hook teams up with Blackbeard to find a way to return, only to end up back in Neverland, whilst Regina turns to an imprisoned Isaac when Henry's powers as the Author goes awry. Plot Opening sequence The spider-infested pillars from the lakeside mansion are seen in the forest. Event Chronology The Dark Realm events involving Gideon take place after \\"Changelings\\" and before \\"Wish You Were Here,\\" while the Storybrooke events leading up to Gideon's backstory and Hook's adventures in the present day Enchanted Forest take place after \\"A Wondrous Place\\" and Hook's return to Neverland take place after \\"Save Henry.\\" In the Past of the Dark Realm In the Dark Realm, 28 years ago in that realm's past, the Black Fairy has received the baby Gideon, who she just stole from the Blue Fairy, and she places the child with one of the child laborers, ordering her to raise the child as if her were the Black Fairy's. As the years pass, a young Gideon is now a prisoner and befriends another boy, Roderick. Gideon vows to protect his friend, but when he lashes out at the Black Fairy, she punishes Roderick instead as a way to torment her grandson. On Gideon's 28th birthday, the Black Fairy tells her grandson (whom she calls her \\"son\\") how proud she is of him, when she noticed one of keys is missing, so she sends Gideon to go after the person responsible. When Gideon discovers that Roderick (who is still a slave) was the person who stole the key, Roderick convinces Gideon to become a hero by defeating the Black Fairy, and tells him that his grandmother is trying to harvest more magic dust after using up the last one (which was used for the first Dark Curse). Gideon apologized to Roderick for what happened when they were young and offered his aid. Roderick then tells Gideon that he needed the power of The Savior (Emma), which requires a magical orb in order to reach her. When Gideon and Roderick find the orb and is ready to contact Emma, the Black Fairy appears. It turns out she had it all set up to test Gideon. When Gideon decided to defend himself however, the Black Fairy responded by turning Roderick into a bug then killing him. She then revealed that she was after Emma all along. She takes Gideon's heart and orders him to find and kill Emma, then bring the Hrunting sword back to her, which will free her from the Dark Realm. In the Enchanted Forest and Neverland (Present Day) At a pub, Hook comes across Blackbeard and the two make a deal, with Hook needing a magic bean and Blackbeard needing a ship, but this one is done over a game of cards, only for Hook to lose to his adversary. When they walked over to the dock, The Jolly Roger is nowhere to be found as it is in another realm, allowing Hook to reveal he meant to lose as Blackbeard had six aces in his deck, knowing he would be returning to Storybrooke either way. Blackbeard reluctantly hands over a bean so they could travel together. However, the portal sends the pirates to a place that Hook is very familiar with: Neverland, as he cannot return home to Emma. When they see the Lost Boys (who chose to stay behind in Neverland the last time they were there) they chase after them, Hook and Blackbeard make to the shoreline but when they reach and see a boat Blackbeard ends the truce by knocking Hook out and escaping with the boat. Hook then continues to run as the Lost Boys chase him. In Storybrooke In the Present Day, Gideon tells Emma that he needs her help to defeat the Black Fairy and as long as he has the napkin with her tears, Hook will not return to her. Emma and Snow then visit Gold and Belle at the Pawn Shop, where despite a plea from Gold and Belle to spare Gideon's life and Emma's doubts, they do come to a truce that Emma should partner up with Gideon, as Gold tells Emma about the Black Fairy and what she is capable of as she is also Gold's mother. Later that night at the clock tower, Emma meets with Gideon and agrees to help, on the condition that they exchange the spell to bring Hook back and Hrunting. Gideon then brings Emma through a door that can serve as a portal for Hook to return through. However, just moments before the spell is activated a giant spider comes through the portal and they run for cover, with Gideon apologizing to Emma for trying to kill her. As their attempts to escape are blocked by spiderwebs, Gideon pushes Emma into one and he takes the sword from her, allowing Gideon to disappear while Emma uses her magic to fight off the spiderwebs until Gold appears and helps Emma destroy the spider, but at that point Gideon has escaped. Hours later, Emma and Snow confront Gold and Belle, but Emma is not convinced about Gideon being saved, prompting Gold to threaten Emma if she endangers Gideon, and as Emma and Snow leave, Gold tells Belle that he still has faith in Gideon. Meanwhile back at the clock tower, Gideon discovers that the portal opened for a brief moment, allowing the Black Fairy to enter Storybrooke. She is now proud of her \\"son\\" and is ready to kill Emma. In-between the events, Regina is attempting to reverse the sleeping curse with help from Henry. When he starts taking notes on what items Regina needed, he starts writing in a possession-like state before he passes out and when he comes to, Henry has no idea what happen to him. They then pay a visit to Isaac, who is now locked up at Storybrooke General Hospital. As they demand Isaac to tell them about why Henry is starting to be possessed, Isaac refuses to tell unless he is given a vehicle, a permanent leave from Storybrooke, and tickets to see Hamilton. When they refuse, Regina and Henry leave, only to have Isaac tell the two that as long as Henry is possessed by the author's powers, they'll only become worse. He agrees to tell them why on the condition that he's freed from his cell. Hours later at the city limits, Regina and Henry give Isaac a car that will allow him to leave town. As part of his agreement, Isaac tells them to look at the \\"Once Upon a Time\\" book, and when Henry opens the pages, he discovers that they're blank because it will soon detail a description of the final battle, the end of Emma's story.

In this episode, Regina attempts to reverse the sleeping curse that Snow and David are under, while Hook encounters Tiger Lily as he finds a way to reach Emma and escape Neverland, and The Black Fairy comes face to face with Gold. In Storybrooke's past, a key element altered a timeline involving Snow and David during the first curse. Plot Opening sequence The portal door that Snow and David create to find Emma, and later use to rescue Hook, is seen in the forest. Event Chronology The Storybrooke and Neverland events during the present day take place after \\"Mother's Little Helper\\" while the flashbacks take place a decade after \\"Welcome to Storybrooke\\", nine years before \\"Save Henry\\" and during Emma's childhood after the flashbacks in \\"The Dark Swan\\" and some years before \\"Snow Drifts\\". In Neverland (Present Day) As Hook is being chased by the Lost Boys (who hold him responsible for Peter Pan's death), he finds himself surrounded at every turn (since the entire island can have everyone followed or be followed). Suddenly, a series of darts knock out the Lost Boys, and Hooks looks up to see Tiger Lily. But moments after he thanks her, she knocks Hook out with a tranquilizer as well. When he comes to, Hook is held captive by Tiger Lily. Hook pleads with Tiger Lily that he wants to return to Storybrooke and Emma, but when Tiger Lily tells Hook that she wants to deliver a driftwood-like weapon which is a fragment of the most powerful fairy wand in existence (which the Blue Fairy had used long ago to banish the Black Fairy to another realm), to help the Savior, he realizes that Tiger Lily is ready to help him. When they come across Peter Pan's former campsite, the two wait for the Lost Boys to fall asleep in order to obtain the magic required to get Hook back to Storybrooke. Tiger Lily also admits to Hook that she was a former fairy who was once close to the Black Fairy, before her turn to Darkness; she later gave up her wings and her wand out of shame, when the Black Fairy fell to Darkness. This was also how she came to acquire the weapon that Emma will need. When they spot a tree whose sap can produce an ability to cross realms, Tiger Lily distracts the Boys while Hook runs to the tree and successfully acquired the sap, and conjures up his shadow. The shadow tries to take off with Hook but the Boys hold Hook down. However, Hook gives the wand fragment to his shadow instead, and it races off to find Emma. The shadow does reach Emma, who then uses the pixie flower potion to open up a portal, rescuing Hook from the Lost Boys and returning to Storybrooke; Tiger Lily escapes into the woods during the diversion. In Storybrooke During the Time of the Dark Curse During the Dark Curse in Storybrooke, Mary Margaret visited David (still listed as John Doe and in a coma) and brought him a pixie flower. Upon touching it, David is brought out of his coma and remembers who he and Mary Margaret are. As Snow distracts Regina, David visits Gold, who he still knows as Rumplestiltskin, about the curse. He informs Gold that Emma (which he soon remembered, like he would later on in the pilot) has not arrived yet. Gold does not know where she is at this point but tells David that the flower has the ability to unite anyone with true love, including Snow and David with Emma. Unfortunately, Regina soon catches on to what Snow did after she brought David back to life. Gold then later tells David and Snow that Emma is still a child and if they go to her they'll be a family again, but by doing so Emma's quest to become The Savior will never happen. Gold then proposes they drink a forgetting potion that would erase all of their past memories, until Emma arrives. When they go to the forest, David and Snow use the flower dust that creates a door that opens to see a young Emma (who was in a group home in 1993 Minnesota). Despite David's desire to go after Emma, Snow believes that Emma must follow her destiny as The Savior in order to save everyone trapped in the Land Without Magic. They shut back the door, kiss one more time, and drink the serum, returning to their cursed identities (with David also going back into the coma). In Storybrooke (Present Day) As a concerned David fears for Emma's future (her hand continues to be shaky, and even Henry is worried), he comes to the conclusion that it's time to end the split sleeping Curse he and Snow has been under to support their daughter in her final battle. The Charmings plead with Regina to use the potion she has been testing out. Later on, Snow watches Regina and Zelena concoct the potion from a cauldron. Regina and Zelena then take their split hearts, dip them in the cauldron so the Curse can disappear, and place it back in their chests, but it turns out that The Evil Queen had it fail-safe, making it impossible for Regina to undo, causing Snow and David to both face the possibility that they will fall asleep under the Curse permanently by the end of that day. Hours later, as David reads a message from Snow, he notices the pixie flower from their past on the screen. Although he believes it can help them break the Curse, Zelena comments that the flowers bloom when great evil is present. As expected, the Black Fairy has arrived to pay Gold, and his wife Belle, a visit at the Pawn Shop. When she says that Gideon won't be leaving her (also implying that he had no choice in helping her), Gold challenges her and takes out a potion, but before he can use it on her, the Black Fairy teleports the Dark One's Dagger into her hand and commands him to stop. She mocks him, telling him that his efforts are futile since she practically invented Dark Magic (this implies that she is over 563 years old, since Nimue became the first Dark One more than 533 years earlier). She returns the Dagger to Gold, saying that she won't force him to join her, but that he will do so willingly. In response, Gold tells her he would never join her, but she tells him that he will change his mind when he sees the Darkness she will bring, and that then, they could be the family that they \\"were always meant to be\\". Then, the Black Fairy teleports herself away with Gideon. Later, the Black Fairy learns of Emma and Snow finding a field full of pixie flowers, which grew due to the Black Fairy's arrival (the flowers grow in the presence of a great evil). The Black Fairy introduces herself to Emma, saying that they were \\"destined to clash since the dawn of time\\". Then she forces Gideon to destroy the flowers, in order to make Snow and Emma suffer, but Emma discovers that one remained. They are able to use the flower to make a potion that can end Snow and David's shared Sleeping Curse for good, only to be interrupted by Hook's shadow. Sensing that Hook is in trouble, Snow tells Emma about her parents' attempt to find her during the first Curse, and now she wants Emma to use the flower to reunite her with Hook, telling Emma she will find another way to wake up Snow and David, before falling asleep. Emma immediately uses the potion to create a portal to Neverland, and brings Hook back to Storybrooke, while Tiger Lily escapes from the Lost Boys. As the two are finally reunited, Hook decides to propose to Emma the right way after admitting that he truly loved her and vowed to be honest with her. Hook gets down on one knee and asks Emma to marry him, and she accepts for real this time. Later on in the Present, Regina, after having come up with a suggestion to reverse the Sleeping Curse, speaks to some of the residents with Snow and David sleeping alongside each other, as she told them about why they sacrificed themselves by allowing Emma to start her destiny to save everyone. Regina tells them that if they all take on the Sleeping Curse at the same time, it might become dilute enough to be easily broken. The residents each decide to drink a small portion of the sleeping curse from a chalice. After they drink it, Snow and David wake up, while the residents fall asleep around them, but soon afterwards, Snow and David see the residents wake again, due to the Sleeping Curse becoming weakened. Hook apologizes to David about killing his father, Robert, but is forgiven. Snow tells Emma that she won't face the Final Battle alone. That evening at a street corner, Gold confronts the Black Fairy, but she insists that he will join her. However, Gold asks her if the reason why she wants him to join her was because Gideon didn't join her willingly. Gold tells her that he knows she has Gideon's heart, and that she had been manipulating Gideon against his will the whole time. When the Black Fairy asks him how he had figured this out, Gold tells the Black Fairy that Gideon was responsible for leaving the one flower behind for Emma and Snow, as he realizes that Gideon is a true believer, because he knows that Belle is his true mother, and that his love for his mother allowed him to resist the Black Fairy's command to a degree. This shocks the Black Fairy, who insists that such a thing is impossible. Gold tells the Black Fairy that he will get Gideon's heart back, no matter what it takes, but in response, the Black Fairy tells her son that if he decides to fight her head-on, Storybrooke could end up entirely destroyed. Gold tells her that this is a price he is willing to pay.

Austin and colleagues published in 2000 suggested that widely separated archaeological excavations in the countries of Israel and Jordan contain late Iron Age (Iron IIb) architecture bearing damage from a great earthquake.Austin, S.A., G. W. Franz, and E. G. Frost. 2000. Amos's Earthquake: An extraordinary Middle East seismic event of 750 B.C. International Geology Review. 42 (7): 657-671. Earthquake debris at six sites (Hazor, Deir 'Alla, Gezer, Lachish, Tell Judeideh, and 'En Haseva), is tightly confined stratigraphically to the middle of the 8th century BC, with dating errors of ~30 years. Excavations by archaeologist Yigael Yadin in Hazor's Stratum VI revealed southward tilted walls, inclined pillars, and collapsed houses, in even some of the strongest architecture, arguing that the earthquake waves were propagated from the north.Yadin Y. 1975. Hazor, the rediscovery of a great citadel of the Bible. New York: Random House, 280 pp. The excavation in the city of Gezer revealed severe earthquake damage. The outer wall of the city shows hewn stones weighing tons that have been cracked and displaced several inches off their foundation. The lower part of the wall was displaced outward (away from the city), whereas the upper part of the wall fell inward (toward the city) still lying course-on-course, indicating the sudden collapse of the wall.Younker, R. 1991.

A report in 2019 by geologists studying layers of sediment on the floor of the Dead Sea further confirmed this particular seismic event.Fact-checking the Book of Amos: There Was a Huge Quake in Eighth Century B.C.E. By Ruth Schuster Haaretz, Jan 03, 2019. Quote: \\"An earthquake that ripped apart Solomon‚Äôs Temple was mentioned in the Bible and described in colorful detail by Josephus ‚Äì and now geologists show what really happened.\\" Amos of Tekoa delivered a speech at the Temple of the Golden Calf in the city of Bethel in the northern kingdom of Israel just \\"two years before the earthquake\\" (Amos 1:1), in the middle of eighth century BC when Uzziah was king of Judah and Jeroboam II was king of Israel. Amos spoke of the land being shaken (), houses being smashed (), altars being cracked (), and even the Temple at Bethel being struck and collapsing (). The Amos' Earthquake impacted Hebrew literature immensely. After the gigantic earthquake, no Hebrew prophet could predict a divine visitation in judgment without alluding to an earthquake. Just a few years after the earthquake, Isaiah wrote about the \\"Day of the Lord\\" when everything lofty and exalted will be abased at the time when the Lord \\"ariseth to shake terribly the earth\\" (). Then, Isaiah saw the Lord in a temple shaken by an earthquake (). Joel repeats the motto of Amos: \\"The Lord also will roar out of Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem,\\" and adds the seismic theophany imagery \\"the heavens and the earth shall shake\\" (Joel 3:16; compare Amos 1:2). After describing a future earthquake and panic during the \\"Day of the Lord\\" at Messiah's coming to the Mount of Olives, Zechariah says, \\"Yea, ye shall flee, like as ye fled from before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah\\" (Zechariah 14:5). The panic caused by Amos' Earthquake must have been the topic of legend in Jerusalem, because Zechariah asked his readers to recall that terrifying event 230 years later.Ogden, K. 1992.

Louisville, KY: Westminster John Knox, 188-198. In 2005 Nicholas Ambraseys reviews the literature on historical earthquakes in Jerusalem and specifically the 'Amos' earthquake. He states that \\"Modern writers date the earthquake to 759 BC and assign to it a magnitude of 8.2, with an intensity in Jerusalem between VIII and IX.\\" He believes that such an earthquake \\"should have razed Jerusalem to the ground\\" and states that there is no physical or textual evidence for this. Discussing Zechariah's mention of an earthquake, he suggests that it was a 5th or 4th century insertion and discusses various versions of the passage which describe the event in different ways. He suggests that the differences may be due to a confused reading of the Hebrew words for \\"shall be stopped up\\" (ve-nistam), and \\"you shall flee\\" (ve-nastem)\\" and that \\"by adopting the latter reading as more plausible in relation to the natural phenomenon described, it is obvious that there is no other explanation than a large landslide, which may or may not had been triggered by this or by another earthquake.\\" He also states that a search for changes in the ground resembling those described in Zechariah revealed \\"no direct or indirect evidence that Jerusalem was damaged.\\" See also *Related Bible parts: Amos 1, Zechariah 13, Luke 24, Acts 1 Notes and references Sources   * External links Jewish *Zechariah 14 Hebrew with Parallel English *Zechariah 14 Hebrew with Rashi's Commentary Christian *Zechariah 14 English Translation with Parallel Latin Vulgate 14 ","title":"Zechariah 14"},{"id":"52916606","text":"Events from the year 1938 in Taiwan, Empire of Japan.

It was originally broadcast on BET from January 24 through January 26, 2017, becoming the network's first scripted miniseries. All six members of New Edition served as co-producers. The series was shown on BET. Cast Main cast Others  Plot   Part One  _Opening Sequence - Home Again Tour - New Mexico, 1997_ Narration by Brook Payne (Wood Harris), the group's first manager, sets the stage: all six members of New Edition are back on tour in 1997, almost twenty years after the group's formation, separations, and solo projects. The divisions are still present as, in addition to performing the group's hits, the three solo acts - Ralph Tresvant, Johnny Gill, and Bobby Brown - and the trio Bell Biv DeVoe (or BBD, for short, made up by Ricky Bell (singer), Michael Bivins, and Ronnie DeVoe) also have their own scheduled sets. Tensions reach a boiling point at the New Mexico concert. As Brown - whose decade-long selfishness and severely erratic behavior resulted in his being suspended from the group a decade prior - starts yet another song well after his scheduled time is up, DeVoe goes on stage, thanking Brown for his performance. He then directs the DJ to begin playing the BBD set. After briefly walking off stage, an enraged Brown returns and gets into a confrontation with DeVoe, as the musical performance is replaced by a wild brawl among the various New Edition members and their entourages, punctuated by a gunshot. Payne's narration states that ego, pride, and greed resulted in this blow up of what had once been a successful group of brothers and decides to rewind the scene nearly twenty years, back to the group's founding in Roxbury, Massachusetts. _The rise of New Edition - Roxbury, MA - 1978-1983_ It's a normal day for the people of Orchard Park Housing Projects (also called \\"O.P.\\"), in Roxbury, Massachusetts in 1978. Despite his mother' refusal to grant her son permission, a young Ricky Bell (played as a youth by Caleb McLaughlin) sneaks out at night to meet his friend, Michael \\"Mike\\" Bivins (played as a youth by Dante Hoagland) to go to a local talent show, where their mutual friend, Bobby Brown (played as a youth by Tyler Marcel Williams) is scheduled to perform. Ricky and Mike are impressed by the sound of a vocal group called \\"The Untouchables\\", while Bobby's performance is a disappointment as he gets stage fright within the first few seconds of his song. The next day, Bobby asks Ricky and Mike to join him on stage the next time he performs, thinking that will help him with his stage fright. Initially unsure, the pair agree as long as another kid from the neighborhood, Ralph Tresvant (played as a youth by Jahi D'Allo Winston), can join. The trio made an assumption of the fact he can be pulled away from a girl, whom he has unsuccessfully been trying to impress with his karate skills, so when Ricky attempts to impress the girl himself, Ralph is able to impress her with his hidden singing talent. The quartet try to practice at Ricky's house but squabble a fair amount. Recognizing they need some guidance, Ricky's sister, Peanut (Bre-Z), suggests they meet with Brooke Payne (Wood Harris), a manager for several of Boston's rising musical acts. The boys sneak into the back alley of a club to convince Brooke to manage them, finally winning him over with an a capella version of The Jackson 5's \\"I Want You Back\\". The next morning, the boys arrive on time to meet Payne. However, Payne doesn't sugarcoat them, warning them they will be doing some extra hard work on their path to becoming musical artists. Payne comes up with the group's name of New Edition, as if they were either a new version or new edition of the Jacksons. After weeks of strenuous training features time spent on choreography, physical and mental discipline, and singing, incuding a cover of Holding On (When Love Is Gone), Payne prepares the quartet in for a big talent showcase at the Strand Theater, where the winning act will receive a recording contract from Maurice Starr (Faizon Love) under his independent record label. In a format reminiscent of the Amateur Night of the Apollo Theater, New Edition dazzles the crowd with the Jackson 5s The Love You Save. Unfortunately, the judges grant 1st prize to a hip-hop duo, \\"The Boston Rebels.\\" The crowd booed the decision, chanting for New Edition so loudly that Maurice gives New Edition a studio recording session and a record deal as well. To strengthen the Jackson 5 connection, Maurice encourages making the group a quintet, with Brooke suggesting his nephew Ronnie DeVoe (played as a youth by Myles Truitt) as the fifth member. Ronnie's audition is good enough for the group to accept him, completing the initial five-member formation of New Edition. Squabbling returns at the recording session, with Ricky and Bobby fighting over a pair of headphones, while Ralph was patiently waiting his turn. Instead, Maurice decides to let Ralph sing first. As a result, the performance is so impressive that Ralph is given the lead vocals for \\"Candy Girl,\\" which would become New Edition's first hit. Prior to finalizing the group, Maurice visits Ralph and offers him a solo deal instead, but Ralph declines, preferring to remain part of New Edition. With their mothers' oversight, the members of New Edition sign their record contract, receiving upfront payments of $500 each and a Betamax machine. Mike then storms out, feeling upset that this would mean the end of his basketball career dream, but is then persuaded by his mother (played by Yvette Nicole Brown) to carry on. With \\"Candy Girl\\" a nationwide hit, New Edition now are rising young stars. The quintet begin taking photo shoots for the cover of their debut album (also named Candy Girl), while also getting ready for a nationwide tour. _First Album and Candy Girl Tour - 1983_ With \\"Candy Girl\\" #1 on the Billboard charts (topping Michael Jackson), New Edition begins making TV and concert hall appearances, including headlining a show at the Roseland Theater in New York City with Madonna and Kurtis Blow. When the group has been on tour (with international dates added) for several weeks, the mothers of Ricky and Bobby, who are struggling financially and on food stamps, seem concerned that they have not yet received any checks their sons should have earned from the shows. Therefore, they decide to confront Brooke Payne, who says he is not in control of the group's finances, despite being its manager. After grumbling about firing Brooke in order to get a manager who could improve the financial situation, they agree to give him a little more time to see if things improve. _Transition of Power / Boys Gone Wild - 1983 to 1984_ The tour finally ends, with the teenagers leaving the high life and returning home to the poverty of Roxbury, at least until their tour checks arrive. However, when the checks finally show up, each member received $1.87 for the entire tour. Brooke, who had never had a major deal with a music industry label before New Edition and may have made some mistakes due to that inexperience, tries to explain the intricacies of the deal: the label advanced the group money that it needed to record the album and to promote the tour, with the label recouping that advance from the money the boys would have earned from the various tour dates. An emotional Brooke, who didn't even get $1.87 for all of his work on the tour, insists that he cares about the boys and wouldn't have intentionally made a deal that was bad for the boys. Four of the mothers vote to fire Brooke as manager. On the other hand, the lone holdout was Flo DeVoe (La La Anthony), Brooke's sister, who threatened to pull Ronnie out of the group. Brooke, however, reminded her that the group was their only best chance at getting out of the projects. The mothers replace Brooke as manager with Gary Evans (Michael Rapaport), who promises to replace their current deal with Maurice Starr with a better one due to his relationship with MCA Records. After the boys enter the office singing Popcorn Love, thinking it will impress everyone, Jheryl Busby (Tank), an executive at MCA, privately expresses to Gary a lack of interest with New Edition, whom he views as \\"some ghetto kids.\\" Having tasted fame and experiencing typical teenage rebellion, the young men of New Edition are less easy to control. Both Gary and the two security guards/chaperones, Jeff Dyson (Wallace Smith) and Khalil Roundtree, unexpectedly walking in on some of the members having sex with female groupies. There is more tension and a lot of anxiety within the group as well. Ralph (Algee Smith)'s talent and constant professionalism result in him taking the lead vocals on most of the songs for the new album. Feeling slighted, the rest of the group focuses more on women and having fun, often without Ralph, to whom they mockingly refer as \\"the big star.\\" This in turn makes Ralph feel betrayed by his friends and frustrated that he is carrying so much of the group's work.  Part Two  _Roller coaster of troubles - 1984-1985_ In an effort to patch things up, Ralph asks Gary if the others could have lead vocals in more songs and Gary agrees. It starts with Bobby (Woody McClain) having lead vocals on \\"Mr. Telephone Man\\" when New Edition was working with singer-songwriter and producer Ray Parker Jr.. During the recording, Bobby (perhaps letting his constant prominence go to his head) maliciously starts making fun of Mike (Bryshere Y. Gray) for being unable to correctly hold a note. Mike takes this and teasing by the other members personally. He decides to take a cab rather than get in the group's limo, slamming the door shut in frustration. The driver, hearing the slam, assumes that Mike is in the car with them. He backs up and accidentally runs over Mike's foot. When Bobby antagonizes Mike yet again, Mike spits in his face. This eventually triggers a fight that prompted the rest of the group to break up. Gary tells the group that their moms think Mike should be kicked out of the group due to fighting. However, the other guys (including Bobby) stick up for Mike. When Mike returns, Bobby goes up to him first and apologizes for his actions. This allows the group to move forward. While internally repaired, New Edition is clashing with their new choreographer. A frustrated Gary decides to bring in someone who can help keep the group focused: Brooke, who was back only as the choreographer, not the manager. Echoing the concerns of MCA executive Jheryl (who, while satisfied financially, is still concerned about the \\"ghetto boys'\\" public persona), Gary presses New Edition to maintain a clean image and be (or at least appear to be) single, the latter of which is particularly important to their young, female fanbase. While rehearsing for the \\"Cool It Now\\" tour, Bobby gets arrested for two crimes: speeding in someone else's car that doesn't belong to him and driving without a license. When Gary comes to the station to bail him out, Bobby reveals that his girlfriend, who was in the car with him, is pregnant. Meanwhile, Ralph's girlfriend back home is also pregnant, but he hasn't told anyone yet. It was later revealed that she would have a miscarriage, partially because Ralph wasn't there to support her during the pregnancy. While smoking weed backstage on tour, the group runs into Johnny Gill (Luke James). Johnny is a Washington, D.C. native, who is another young artist within the music industry. At another stop on New Edition's tour, no one can locate Bobby, until Gary finds him in the car doing cocaine with and receiving fellatio from female groupies. When discussing the situation with his fellow New Edition members, Bobby insists that he has his personal life under control. _Out with the old, In with the new - 1985-1988_ After the tour, the mothers meet with Gary, frustrated yet again at their sons receiving less money than expected. Gary brings up the group's various expenses and drug/alcohol habits as contributing to the smaller checks, despite New Edition's self-titled second album with MCA being certified platinum. Viewing the act as \\"Bobby Brown with New Edition\\" instead of just \\"New Edition,\\" Bobby's ego continues to inflate out of control. It comes to a head at a show in Oakland, California. While enjoying the whole spotlight to himself while singing lead vocals for \\"Mr. Telephone Man,\\" the remaining four initially felt annoyed over Bobby selfishly trying to hog the entire onstage spotlight to himself. As a result, Ronnie, Ricky, Mike, and Ralph all quickly transitioned into their next song,\\"Cool It Now.\\" This results in a severely enraged Bobby dictating that he wouldn't perform with New Edition anymore. Since Bobby does not get his way in the group, he tosses his mic in the air before storming off the set. Fed up with Bobby's actions, Gary pressures Ronnie, Mike, Ricky, and Ralph into voting to kick Bobby out of the group as punishment. Despite their initial reluctance to kick him out, thinking about Bobby's arrest, severe drug usage, continual selfishness, and disrespect eventually prompts the four to unanimously vote Bobby out instead. While driving with Jeff (one of the group's security guards that Gary had hired), Mike speculates on what (if any) future the group has without Bobby. Jeff makes a suggestion that Mike should consider getting in the business side of the industry, given how few broke executives there are compared to broke musicians, as well as giving him more control. Mike glances at the All For Love record, which he and the group (including Bobby) had recorded the year prior and notices \\"Fast Break Productions\\" on the record rather than MCA Records. Mike storms into Jheryl's office, interrupting a meeting to demand an explanation. The MCA executive explains to Mike that, rather than being signed to MCA Records, they were signed to Fast Break Productions, which was Gary's company, which in turn had a relationship with MCA Records. In other words, rather than just being a manager who could use his connections to get the group a deal with MCA (as Gary had indicated to the mothers and the members of the group), Gary had drafted a contract that gave him two things: ownership and control of New Edition. This ensured that he got his money before the group did, as well as allowing him to do things like negotiating a shoe deal without consulting the members of the group. Still stunned that their contract with Gary wasn't much better than their $1.87 contract with Maurice Starr four years ago, Mike can't really respond when Jheryl rhetorically asks him if he even read Gary's contract before signing it as opposed to just relying on Gary's explanation. Jheryl finally ends the meeting with a response, saying, \\"Welcome to the music business.\\" This gives Mike the opportunity to see what it is like to be a music executive- with the group's approval- meets with an attorney to fire Gary as manager and to work by getting out of their contract in order to sign directly with MCA. Back home in Boston, Bobby is packaging cocaine for distribution while watching the remaining members of New Edition perform \\"Count Me Out\\" on Soul Train. His mom enters his room to tell him that he has a visitor: Jheryl. He feels Bobby has too much talent to waste his life to drugs and offers him a solo deal with MCA, where he eventually records his debut solo album. Having moved in together, Ralph's girlfriend encourages him to similarly go solo. Ralph insists that while he is happy with the group, he does start to record some solo tracks without telling the rest of the group beforehand. When Ralph plays some of the solo songs for Ricky, Mike, and Ronnie, they feel betrayed. They are not very supportive even when Ralph says he would still be part of the group and just do the solo stuff as a side project, which results in Ralph feeling isolated and frustrated. When Ronnie expresses concern about how he'd take care of his family without New Edition, Mike starts working on a plan, so that they aren't dependent on Ralph. Meanwhile, Ralph, looking forward to solo money rather than splitting with other members of New Edition, shares his feelings with Jheryl. He stresses the importance of two things: timing and positioning, which is why Ralph's solo album will come out later after New Edition records another album. This one with Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, who had just produced Janet Jackson's smash album, Control a year prior. The group arrives in Minneapolis to begin recording Heart Break with Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. Ralph - who is known for always being on time and ready to go - travels separately and arrives late. After a chilly greeting with Ricky, Mike, and Ronnie, Ralph is baffled to see a fifth member of New Edition: Johnny Gill, who Mike and Jheryl thought would be a good fit for the group. Angered that he wasn't even consulted about the decision and upset over having to split money five ways again, Ralph storms off. Johnny, Jimmy Jam, and Terry Lewis are also rattled, as they assumed Ralph knew about Johnny. Still sulking, Ralph can't help but be impressed by Johnny's voice (if not his cowboy boot fashion sense). After a recording session, the two have a private conversation (because the other three guys didn't bother to hang around for the session), with Ralph apologizing for his initial conduct. He was admitting that the situation was more about his relationship with the other guys than anything Johnny had done. Ralph and Johnny realize they have several things in common, including professionalism and being fed the same story by Jheryl about delaying a solo project until after recording a New Edition album. Now that Ralph and Johnny were cool, Ralph jokingly asked if wannabe executive Mike sold Johnny on being the next Bobby. Johnny honestly replied that Mike described it as being the next Ralph. Slightly jarred by the thought of being replaced, Ralph regains his normal focus and dedication, with the entire group contributing to a great performance of \\"Can You Stand The Rain\\" and work well together recording the rest of the album. While preparing for Heart Break's album cover photo shoot, the men discuss how they've grown personally and professionally in their years in the recording business. When the photographer encourages them to smile, the group insists they know what works best for them and opts for a more serious facial expression. While working on a music video for If It Isn't Love (with Brooke Payne once again providing choreography) and preparing for another tour, MCA's A&R;/business partner Louis Silas Jr. (Duane Martin) drops the bombshell that Bobby will be touring with them.  Part Three  _A Fork in the Road - 1988-1990_ New Edition continues their preparations for the upcoming tour by releasing their new single \\"If It Isn't Love.\\" Meanwhile, at the Paramount Pictures studio, Bobby Brown (who has skyrocketed to super- stardom with his second album Don't Be Cruel) prepares for his \\"Every Little Step\\" music video. Brown's barber (DC Young Fly) is distracted by the girls that will appear in the video and accidentally cuts off a chunk of Bobby's hair. This left a slant in Bobby's hair that Bobby irately compares to \\"Gumby.\\" Without time to fix it, Bobby is forced to debut what would become his signature look in the video instead. Bobby and New Edition are generally able to work well together on the tour, which also features singer Al B. Sure! (Josh David). Despite this, Bobby bristles a bit when \\"his\\" supposed lead vocals on Jealous Girl and Mr. Telephone Man will be both sung by Johnny even after Bobby originally offered to sing them himself. After a Washington, D.C. performance, Mike agrees to listen to a group of young men from Philadelphia sing one of New Edition's songs for him outside the tour bus. Impressed, Mike gives them a business card and encourages the group that will become Boyz II Men to call him. In 1989, a party to celebrate the success of the tour, revealing how the group split up again. Jheryl is leaving his job at MCA Records to take a major role at Motown and convinces Johnny to come with him and record his self-titled third album - the one Jheryl promised he would support if Johnny recorded Heart Break with New Edition - at Motown. Ralph's similarly promised solo album will be released by MCA but must be re-recorded because Ralph and the executives felt that it would sound too much like Bobby's Don't Be Cruel album. Ralph is annoyed, because his album was originally ready to be released before Heart Break. However, it was delayed in favor of the New Edition album. As for Ricky, Mike, and Ronnie, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis suggest the trio start their own group, which would become Bell Biv DeVoe, based on their last names. Finally, the arrogant and disrespectful Bobby, who made a scene by sticking his hands into both of the party's cakes, is angry despite his individual success and being surrounded by attractive women. He almost showed constant jealousy looking out at his former group members. In March 1990, all six members of New Edition reunite by making an appearance for Video Soul with Sherry Carter. There is clearly awkwardness and tension during the interview, with barbed comments flying all around, particularly between Ralph and Mike (still not yet over inviting Johnny to the group without consulting Ralph), as well as Bobby and everyone else. The show also airs each of the separate acts' music videos: BBD's \\"Poison\\", Ralph Tresvant's \\"Sensitivity\\", and Johnny Gill's \\"My, My, My.\\" When the host asked the most anticipated question, \\"Would the group ever reunite for a new album?,\\" Ralph suggested there was a possibility to record a reunion album in the coming future. _Are we \\"Home Again\\" or not? - 1996-1997_ The reunion album is made six years later, in 1996, after the various independent acts somewhat fizzled. This left several in debt, or at least precarious, financial position, especially Ricky (Elijah Kelley). Several of the group members, now approaching their 30s, are also dealing with personal issues: Ralph is struggling with the passing of his mother, while Bobby is no longer the only member with drug and alcohol issues. Also, Ricky is secretly using cocaine, popping pills, and drinking heavily, hiding his problems from his wife as well as the rest of New Edition. As the group prepares for a tour of Home Again, Brooke is amazed at their expenses - separate tour buses, large entourages, much luggage - despite their limited success as independent acts, as well as being less professional than when they were kids. While the group will perform New Edition songs, they will also perform the songs of their various respective acts. Unfortunately, this tour does not go well, with Bobby's penchant for missing various interviews and even performances annoying the rest of the group and interfering with scheduled performance times. At one stop, Bobby arrived after the rest of the group had finished performing but decided to close the show solo instead. Bobby claimed that he felt like singing, because the crowd was chanting for him. The tour arrives in New Mexico, where the miniseries began, though with some additional details on what would lead to the massive brawl. Bobby - on time for a change - decided to sing an extra song, at least partially because Bell Biv DeVoe couldn't go on as Ronnie (Keith Powers) was late. Bobby assumes that he was the real star of the tour. Thus, when Ronnie charged onto the stage to cut off Bobby, Bobby was partially angry, claiming that he was covering for Ronnie by doing an extra song. Storming backstage angry, Bobby tries to blast Bell Biv DeVoe with water from a fire hose but can't get the emergency device to work. Instead, he and his bodyguard march onstage, which brings in the various entourages for a chaotic scene, finally culminating with a gun shot that scatters everyone. In the chaos, Brooke stumbles away and has a heart attack before being found by one of the members of the Bell Biv DeVoe entourage. An ambulance arrives to take him to the hospital, but won't allow Ronnie (who is Brooke's nephew) in with him. Instead, both Ricky and Mike try to keep Ronnie calm while waiting for a car. Ralph and Johnny get filled in, but Ronnie nearly loses it when Bobby appears to ask what's going on. He angrily blames Bobby for starting the fracas that led to his uncle having a heart attack. Bobby, on the hand, angrily counter-argues that he would never hurt Brooke and that it was Ronnie who provoked the situation. Ronnie angrily storms off for good this time, saying he's done with the tour. Also, he's fed up with Ralph and Johnny always coddling Bobby. Bobby walks off, stating that he was doing everyone else a favor by agreeing to the reunion, but Johnny snaps at Bobby. He states that Bobby did nothing for him. Bobby angrily lashes out at Johnny, declaring that the group is deceased and finished. Ralph leaves after getting into it with Mike, and Johnny was fed up wasting his time with the hostility. When a panicked Ricky asks Mike what they are going to do with so many shows left, Mike essentially says the tour and the group are both done. _Souls falling apart / Finding myself - 1998-2004_ In the years after the tour, the New Edition members largely stay out of contact and have their lives go in different directions. *Johnny is largely OK music wise, forming a new group called LSG with Gerald Levert and Keith Sweat but not seeming interested in talking to a radio personality about New Edition and the destruction of the group during the Home Again album and tour during a radio interview. *Taking all the knowledge of the business side of the music industry that Jeff game, Mike becomes a full-time music executive himself. He starts his own label Biv 10 Records. Mike is now finding himself on the other side of the table when dealing with artists and often using the same words (\\"Did you even read your contract?\\") that people like Jheryl had said to Mike when New Edition was just starting. *Ralph's short marriage to his longtime girlfriend Xeina ends in a grimey divorce, with her taking the cars, house, sole custody of the kids and half of their shared assets. Being the mild mannered guy that he is, Ralph eventually deciding not to fight too much to contest. * With the Home Again tour falling apart and the group not on any speaking terms whatsoever, Ronnie decides to pursue a whole endeavor by enrolling in some real estate classes to become a real estate agent. However, he feels somewhat embarrassed when a fan recognizes him, feeling like he is at a rock bottom. *The New Edition member really at rock bottom is Ricky, whose drug and alcohol use gets worse when he faces bankruptcy, aggravated by lawsuits from the tour's abrupt end and lack of any job or trade skills other than music. Ricky's wife, Amy, suggests asking the members of New Edition for help but he refused. Instead, he asks her if she knows someone with a truck to help them move out of their foreclosed house. *Bobby's life at this time, including his relationship with his then wife at the time, Whitney Houston, is not shown in this miniseries but was later shown in his 2018 miniseries,The Bobby Brown Story'. Ricky eventually has an overdose, but his wife finds him in time for help to arrive and save him. At rehab, Ricky admits that what he was chasing was the feeling of fame, fortune, and popularity that he had years prior, as well as trying to fight the fear that the feeling wouldn't come back. In 2004, Ronnie's wedding planning isn't going well, with his latest concern being wasting money for inedible flowers on the wedding cake. His fianc√©e, Shamari, gets him to admit that his real issue is not having reunited New Edition, either as a musical group or to be his groomsmen for his rapidly approaching wedding. Concerned that their egos and behavior will both prevent any of them from showing up, Ronnie is convinced to at least invite the other five members to his wedding so that he won't have regrets. _I am my Brother's Keeper / BET 25th Celebration - 2005_ The day of the wedding, Ronnie is in his prep room, on his own, accepting that he's going to be at the altar without any groomsmen. He hears a knock on the door and \\"Police!\\", only for it to be Bobby in a dazzling all-white tuxedo. Although Bobby thanks Ronnie for the invitation to be a groomsman, he declines an offer for a drink, saying he has cooled on drugs and alcohol, but asks for a soda instead. The rest of New Edition arrives, including a sober Ricky, with Ralph and Mike at least able to be civil to each other. The final arrival is Brooke, back to normal, after his heart attack at the disastrous tour and ready to see his nephew Ronnie get married. At the reception, Ralph and Mike have a longer conversation, with Mike apologizing for starting the group's break up by bringing in Johnny to replace Ralph. Ralph counters that the group faced bigger problems than that, citing that the problems, which the members were only ready to deal with now that they were older. Rather than just a temporary truce, Ralph and Mike seem to have rekindled their friendship, ready to move forward without dwelling on negative events from the past. Brooke toasts Ronnie and his new wife and includes New Edition in his toast by reminiscing about raising Ronnie and the other members of the group, encouraging them to be thankful for their success as a musical group and as men. New Edition reunites to serenade Ronnie's wife with their first hit song \\"Candy Girl.\\" A BET producer approaches Brooke with the idea of having a New Edition reunion at the channel's 25th anniversary special. Brooke advises him to move quickly, as he doesn't know the next time the group will be together like this. The producer, however, does move quickly enough, as the group agrees to reunite for the BET special. At the special, New Edition begins to perform a medley of hit singles: \\"If It Isn't Love,\\" \\"Can You Stand the Rain,\\" \\"Candy Girl,\\" and \\"Cool It Now\\" before introducing Bobby Brown to perform \\"Mr. Telephone Man\\" with them. After Bobby gives a solo performance of his solo classic hit single \\"My Prerogative,\\" Bobby then invites the group along to perform a medley with him, with highlights of the miniseries airing as the group sings. They all take a bow and give props and credit to BET for giving their long standing partnership as a final sendoff. Development Production In August 2015, it was announced that BET commissioned the television film that would air as a three night miniseries. Five of the group's members--Ricky Bell, Michael Bivins, Ronnie DeVoe, Johnny Gill and Ralph Tresvant, had signed on as co-producers, while Bobby Brown did not. In addition, the band's longtime manager Brooke Payne had also been tapped as a co-producer and the film was to be written by Abdul Williams who wrote the 2010 film Lottery Ticket. Jesse Collins of the network's Real Husbands of Hollywood would serve as executive producer. Collins later reported that production would air in 2017. In April 2016, it was confirmed that Brown had also signed on as co-producer. It was also announced that ATL director Chris Robinson would direct the film. In November 2016, it was announced that iconic producers Kenneth \\"Babyface\\" Edmonds and Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis had been recruited to oversee the music production. Casting Casting for the series began in Boston in January 2016. In April 2016, the network announced that Empire star Bryshere Y. Gray would portray Michael Bivins. The rest of cast included actor and singer Elijah Kelley as Ricky, R&B; singer Luke James as Johnny, Algee Smith as Ralph, Keith Powers as Ronnie, and Woody McClain as Bobby Brown. In addition, Dante Hoagland, Caleb McLaughlin, Myles Truitt, Jahi Winston, and Tyler Marcel Williams would portray younger versions of Michael, Ricky, Ronnie, Ralph and Bobby respectively. In May 2016, La La Anthony, Yvette Nicole Brown, Monica Calhoun, Lisa Nicole Carson and Sandi McCree would join the cast as the mothers of the group members: Flo DeVoe, Shirley Bivins, Patricia Tresvant, Mae Bell and Carole Brown. Several others joined the cast later that month including Wood Harris as Brooke Payne, Michael Rapaport as Gary Evans, Wallace Smith as Jeff Dyson, Faizon Love as Maurice Starr, Duane Martin as Louil Silas, singer Tank as Jheryl Busby and actress/rapper Bre-Z as Peanut Bell. Promotion The first trailer for the film was unveiled on June 26, 2016, at the 16th annual BET Awards. In July 2016, BET released a photo of the cast recreating the group's iconic album cover for the 1996 release Home Again. In September 2016, BET announced the official premiere date for the film which would air on January 24, 25 and 26, 2017. The network also released an extended trailer which highlighted the legendary onstage brawl between Bobby Brown and Bell Biv DeVoe after Brown went solo. The UrbanWorld Film Festival hosted an exclusive screening of several clips. Reception Ratings The film's premiere was watched by 4.2 million viewers, making it BET's most watched premiere since the 2012 season premiere of the sitcom The Game, which drew 5.2 million. The second and final episodes brought in 3.96 million and 4.23 million viewers respectively, making the miniseries the top rated cable program for three consecutive nights. Critical The New Edition Story has garnered positive reviews from critics. On Metacritic, the series holds a score of 76 out of 100. It currently has a 100% rating, with an average score of 7.2/10 on Rotten Tomatoes, along with the consensus being, \\"The New Edition Story colorfully showcases its subjects with honesty and clarity while offering an entertainingly paced overview that leaves room for plenty of the group's greatest hits\\". The film received rave reviews for the child actors who portrayed younger versions of New Edition in the first part of the series. Sylvia Obell of Buzzfeed praised the casting as \\"absolute perfection\\" and rated it an A+. Obell compared the film to another iconic television miniseries -- \\"it is on its way to being the best black TV biopic since The Jacksons: An American Dream\\" which aired on ABC in 1992. The most talked about similarities is the uncanny \\"jawdropping\\" striking resemblance of the young Bobby Brown, portrayed by Tyler Marcel Williams, who nailed the looks, demeanor and Bobby's most iconic \\"body roll\\". Also another uncanny resemblance were of the vocals of the young Ralph Tresvant, portrayed by Jahi Di'Allo Winston. For viewers, hearing his first lead solo appearance in the film singing \\"Candy Girl\\" gave chills for nailing every note. Trey Mangum of Blavity said that BET \\"outdid\\" themselves, saying \\"With the warm reception and open arms that the world received The New Edition Story with, it's clear that this story needed to be told, and this was the perfect time.\\" Mangum complimented the \\"spot-on\\" casting of both the young and adult casts, as well as the fact both casts recorded their own vocals, a rarity for musical biopics. During an interview with Bell Biv DeVoe on the radio show, The Breakfast Club, co-host Angela Yee described the casting for the film as \\"fantastic.\\" Michael Bivins praised Algee Smith's portrayal of Tresvant and said he was \\"real nice, sliding into the most difficult spot.\\" In another interview, Ricky Bell along with Bivins praised Elijah Kelley for his portrayal of Ricky in the film. Bell further praised young actor Caleb McLaughlin for his portrayal as well.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CacOFhIb60I Broadcast In June 2018, it was announced that The New Edition Story will stream on Hulu.

It runs from Christianshavns Kanal in the northwest to Christianshavns Voldgade and Christianshavns Vold in the southeast, passing Dronningensgade and Prinsessegade on the way. History Sofiegade is one of the streets that date from the foundation of Christianshavn in the beginning of the 17th century. It was originally called Sankt Sofie Gade, complementing Sankt Ann√¶ Gade on the opposite of Torvegade. Sankt Sofiegade, like Sankt Ann√¶ Gade today, was originally located on both sides of Christianshavns Kanal but with no bridge to connect them. The two street sections became known as Store Sofiegade (Large Sofiegade) and Lille Sofiegade (Small Sofiegade) respectively. The site at the corner of Store Sofiegade and Prinsessegade, closest to Christians Vold, was in 1732 acquired by a brewer and turned into a brewery and beer garden. After a few years, it was turned into a textile factory. The property was acquired in 1786 by Thomas Potter and turned into an iron foundry. Some of his employees also lived in the street. His own home was located at the site from 1806/7 until his death in 1811. The iron foundry existed until 1927 and the buildings were demolished in the 1970s. Lille Sofiegade, which was located on the west side of the canal, disappeared in 1865 as a result of expanding industrial activity in the area. Store Sofiegade was from then on simply known as Sofiegade. Notable buildings and residents Sofiegade No. 15A: SofieBadet SofieBadet (No. 15A) is a public bath house from 1909. It was designed by Hans Wright and remained in use until 1927. The building was listed in 2000 and has since reopened as a public wellness centre. The modern building at No. 3-7 is part of the dorm Sofieg√•rden which takes its name after the street. The listed Steinfass House, which fronts Christianhacns Kanal, is also part of the dorm.

Sobada is divided into two general categories. One type of sobada, which is done by midwives, helps with the reproductive cycle when a woman is pregnant. The second type of sobada, which is performed by los sobadores, or people who specialize in sobada, helps to reposition organs or parts of the body that are considered out of alignment. Sobada is part of the system of values and is part of the local language. There is a known difference between what sobada is and what a light massage is.  Prenatal Sobada  Sobada is done by the midwife to her pregnant patient during various prenatal visits. The massage is usually done within a greeting, massage and leave taking structure. Depending on the needs of the mother-to-be, certain parts of this structure may be expanded upon. For example, expansions can help relieve particular bodily symptoms as well can be used to help turn a baby around. Sobada is thought by both midwives and mothers to be one of the most important parts of prenatal care for both the baby and the mother. Sobada is also thought to be a way for a woman to take everyday care of their bodies. The massage begins after formal greetings have been done and the massage is always done in a casual and leisurely style. The midwife will have the woman lie on the ground, usually on top of a blanket and a gunnysack, and have the woman expose her stomach. The midwife will apply either oil or Vaseline to her hands and the woman's stomach and begin the massage. Throughout the massage the midwife will talk with the woman about how she has been feeling and about other details like the expected birthdate. The first part of the massage is done on the abdomen of the woman. By stroking and probing the abdomen, the midwife can use the massage to help determine the position of the baby and help her decide if it is turned in an unfavorable position or not. The midwife can also estimate the due date of the baby by locating the baby's head and measuring the height of the abdomen with their fingers. The midwife will do a procedure of \\"lifting the uterus\\" while massaging the abdomen area. The midwife will do this by pushing their fingers into the side and going underneath the pregnant uterus. The midwife will then pull the uterus towards them. Once this has been done on one side of the woman's body, the midwife will repeat this action on the other side. The next stage of the sobada massage is done to the woman's back. The midwife will put firm pressure on the woman's back and move their palm down along the woman's spine. The midwife will then have the woman turn so they can do this part of the massage on the other side of the woman's back. The midwife may also massage the woman's calves and thighs by holding the woman's legs up and rubbing in a downwards motion. In the last stage, the midwife helps the woman stand up. To do this the midwife will raise the woman's knees so that her feet are flat on the ground. The midwife will then take the woman's hands and helps pull her to reach a standing position. After this stage of the massage, the woman is instructed to rest.  Potential Advantages of Prenatal Sobada  = Identify a Breech or Transverse Baby = One potential benefit a pregnant person can get from the sobada massage is the midwife can determine if a baby is in a breech or transverse position. When the midwife determines this, they may decide to do an inversion (external version). This is when the midwife helps to turn the baby in a head-down position while still in utero. A baby that is in a head-down position is considered to be more favorable. It is also thought that adjusting the baby's position helps make the baby more comfortable. To do this, the midwife will locate the baby's head and hip. Then, by applying strong and even pressure, the midwife is able to shift the baby into a head-down position. = Prevent Afterbirth = Midwives in the Yucat√°n believe that by doing the process of \\"lifting the uterus up\\", the afterbirth won't stick. For the mother, it is thought that sobada helps to make the birthing process easier, relieve discomfort and also provide emotional support for the woman through physical contact. For the baby, sobada is thought to help reposition the baby to make it more comfortable.  Sobada for Manipulation of Organs  Sobada is also used to manipulate the position of one's organs. It is believed that everything in the body twists and moves on its own due to events like falling, over exertion and pregnancy. It is also believed that all organs have a specific place and alignment and ones organs must stay in that place to maintain health. People who perform this kind of sobada go through a long apprenticeship and have a strong knowledge of the use of their hands. This kind of sobada is performed on men, women and children. The person who is receiving this kind of sobada will lie in an isolated part of the house and will have it performed on them early in the morning before they have eaten. The person who is giving the sobada will put an oily solution on their hands and begin the massage by localizing the position of an organ. They will then slowly move the organ back to its correct position and apply pressure over the organ with their thumb or palm of hand. Sometimes a temporary bandage may be put around the person's belly because it is thought to help keep everything in place. The person giving performing the sobada may also decide to massage other parts of the body like the neck, arm, legs and head.  Prenatal Massages in Other Cultures  Biomedical professionals and midwifery training programs have discouraged midwives from doing massages. They are especially concerned about the dangers of external versions. This aspect concerns them because there is a risk the midwife may apply too much pressure and cause detachment of the placenta. It is unknown how often this happens or how many times it has happened. Many studies have been done to see the potential benefits of massage therapy and pregnancy.

She is known for her direct marketing campaign at AOL that increased the number of subscribers from 200,000 to more than 22 million. Early life and education  Jan Brandt was born in Brooklyn, New York and moved to New Jersey at the age of eight. She graduated from Boston University's School of Public Communications. Following graduation, she began working as a copywriter at Xerox Education Publications in Middletown, Connecticut. She enrolled in night courses at the University of Connecticut and decided to switch careers to marketing.  Career  After a brief period working for Colonial Penn in Philadelphia, Brandt moved to Palo Alto, California to join Education Today publishing with Thomas O. Ryder, where she worked for 10 years. She then briefly returned to Xerox Education Publications, which by then had been acquired by Newfield Publications, before being hired by Steve Case as vice president of marketing of AOL in 1993.  AOL  AOL free trial CDs sent to a student dormitory in Aachen, Germany Brandt was hired with the explicit goal to grow the subscriber base and was given free rein over AOL's marketing strategies. After AOL began sending complimentary discs to people who requested them, Brandt set up a direct marketing campaign to distribute AOL installation diskettes in the mail. The trial campaign cost $250,000 and had an average response of over 10% uptake, with some mailing lists pulling as high as 16-18%. This prompted Brandt to expand the campaign beyond direct mailing and start working with nonconventional distribution partners, such as airlines and cereal companies. At one point, 50% of the CDs produced worldwide had an AOL logo. This \\"carpet bombing\\" strategy was instrumental in moving AOL beyond Prodigy and CompuServe to dominate the online service provider market. In 2002, Brandt stepped down as vice chair and chief marketing officer of AOL to take a part-time consulting position. Brandt was named twice by Fortune Magazine as one the \\"50 Most Powerful Women in American Business\\", in 1999 and again in 2000. She also received Direct Marketing Days New York's \\"Direct Marketer of the Year\\" award in 2000, and the 2001 \\"Direct Marketer of the Year\\" award from Target Marketing.  Personal life  Brandt has been politically active since the 1990s, and a longtime supporter of EMILY's List. She currently sits on the board of directors for Women for Women International, a humanitarian organization for providing aid to women in war-torn regions.

A., Leyva, J. L., Sowell, S. N., Nehmad, A., & Duffing, E. (2000). U.S.- Mexico Border XXI Program: Progress Report 1996‚Äì2000 (S. N. Sowell, Ed.). Retrieved April 13, 2017, from http://sandiegohealth.org These issues are increased in changes of population growth, policy, and climate change.  History  The Mexico‚ÄìUnited States border consist of a continental boundary of 1,954 mi. This border region is composed of diverse terrains in which various species, peoples, and indigenous tribes have made their homes. Through the decades, both countries have attributed to the increase in population growth, manufacturing corporations, and fragmentation of land due to border policy changes which contribute to environmental disparities between these neighboring borders.  Policy framework   La Paz Agreement  On August 14, 1983, the United States and Mexico entered into the United States‚ÄìMexico Agreement on Cooperation for the Protection and Improvement of the Environment in the Border Area, known as the La Paz Agreement.Stephen P. Mumme & Kimberly Collins, The La Paz Agreement 30 Years On, Journal of Environment & Development Vol. 23, Issue 3 (May 7, 2014). The agreement aims to protect and conserve the environment along the border. The agreement sets forth the responsibilities of both parties to prevent and control air, water, and land pollution in the border area. This agreement is made in accordance to each country's laws. The agreement entails that both parties must take responsibility for their border area and have the right to raise concerns if one state's environmental hazards linger into the other. The agreement highlights that both countries have the responsibility of coordinating with one another in the creation of national programs, scientific and educational exchanges, environmental monitoring, environmental impact assessment, and periodic exchanges of information and data on pollution sources in their respective territory. The information collected is then exchanged between each country every year at an annual meeting. The host nation alternates between the two countries. The collection of data is at the expense of each country. In consensus with one another the countries can make any annex changes to the agreement. Either party may terminate the agreement at any time, with the withdrawal made effect after a sixty-day period. Thirty years after it was signed, the La Paz Agreement \\"remains the keystone agreement for bilateral cooperation on environmental protection in the border zone.\\"  International Boundary and Water Commission (IBWC)  US-Mexico Water Treaty The International Boundary and Water Commission (IBWC) is an extension of the International Boundary Commission (IBC) that was established in 1889. In 1944 the IBC extended its responsibilities by including water regulations and treaties which gave it its new name and new responsibilities. This commission has two sections one belonging to the United States located in El Paso, Texas and the other to Mexico with its location in Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua. The IBWC's main focus is on the sanitation, distribution, and flood control over natural river waters and the distribution of boundaries between the U.S. and Mexican borders. The treaties and agreements have an in-depth focus on the water distribution of the Rio Grande, Colorado River, Tijuana River, Santa Cruz River, and other water components that flow into these rivers. These water masses must be maintained by both parties at each countries own expense. The IBWC also protects lands along the river from floods by levee and flood- way projects. Each country expanded their IBWC departments to have organizations within their department for deterring floods, pollution, and waste from these masses of water. Such departments include treatment plants, dams, levee systems, emergency departments, data collecting departments, and field offices. Robert J. McCarthy, writing in the Water Law Review, states that the IBWC, has become an anachronism in which there is lack of oversight, regulation, and distribution of the natural resources between both countries. He makes his claims based on empirical research and data he collects from employees, water data collected, and legal structure within the IBWC sections both in the U.S. and Mexico. He claims that this system is uni-polar and the policies are in favor of the U.S. leading to unequal disparities for Mexico.  EPA policy  According to the Environmental Protection Agencies agenda, their main priority is to reduce the concentrations of particulate matter PM10 and PM2.5 along the border. In their most recent program, designed to be executed by 2020, their main focus has shifted to air pollution. This shift was caused to empirical data and information exchanged by both countries in their 2012 annual review. The Border 2012 Program was the third bi-national agreement adopted under the La Paz Agreement of 1983. Border 2012 was initiated in April 2003 by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Mexico's Secretar√≠a de Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales (SEMARNAT). The program completed over 400 projects using a community-based approach that prioritized the most serious environmental and public health concerns reported by residents and workers along the shared border region. Most of the projects funded by Border 2012 were designed to remedy issues specific to a community. Other projects were completed or applied to issues that affected multiple communities. A wide breadth of creativity in addressing environmental and health concerns went into the achievements of the individual communities. One such example consists of the students and faculty of Autonomous University in Ciudad Ju√°rez who crafted spray-paint cans that are better for the environment than the outdated spray cans previously used in the auto industry. Borderwide projects made huge achievements in areas such as scrap tire removal, providing safe drinking water systems and connecting homes to wastewater facilities, government collection of unused pesticides and agro- chemicals, improved emergency response and readiness in case of an environmental disaster, created coordinated binational responses in the event of an emergency along the border, community cleanups and solid waste removal from various waterways on both sides of the border, properly removing or recycling e-waste in U.S. and Mexico, and took inventories of greenhouse gas emissions (GHE).  Customs & Border Protection Environmental Policy  U.S. Customs and Border Protection is charged with border management and control in the United States. One of CBP's many functions is to integrate environmental stewardship in accordance to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969. This act ensures that CBP evaluates all environmental hazards that can affect the ecosystem, endangered species, or indigenous tribes along the border. Environmental hazards must be tested when, \\"planning projects; leasing, purchasing, constructing, operating, maintaining, or decommissioning equipment, facilities, or tactical infrastructure; and revising and implementing operational programs and activities\\" along the border. Along with tests, CBP must also reach out to stake holders, non-government organizations, state, and indigenous tribes to maximize and sustain potential outcomes.  Secure Fence Act  The Secure Fence Act of 2006 was passed providing for the construction of 700 miles (1,100 km) of high-security fencing. This act was processed under the Bush Administration in attempts to complete the construction of the United States‚ÄìMexico barrier. The fencing built under the 2006 act caused habitat fragmentation that affected wildlife, including endangered animals. A 2011 study published in the peer-reviewed journal Diversity and Distributions determined that the habitat fragmentation determined that \\"small range size is associated with a higher risk of extinction, and for some species, the barriers reduce range by as much as 75%.\\"Jesse R. Lasky, Walter Jetz & Timothy H. Keitt, Conservation biogeography of the US‚ÄìMexico border: a transcontinental risk assessment of barriers to animal dispersal (first published online March 3, 2011; in July 2011), Volume 17, Issue 4, pp. 673‚Äì687, doi:10.1111/j.1472-4642.2011.00765.x. Summarized at Melissa Gaskill, United States border fence threatens wildlife: Barrier between the United States and Mexico divides habitats and puts species at risk, Nature (August 2, 2011), doi:10.1038/news.2011.452. The study identified the most \\"at risk\\" species as the Arroyo toad (Anaxyrus californicus), California red-legged frog (Rana draytonii), black-spotted newt (Notophthalmus meridionalis), Pacific pond turtle (Clemmys marmorata), and jaguarundi (Puma yagouaroundi). The study also identified coastal California, coastal Texas, and the Madrean Sky Island Archipelago of southeastern Arizona and southwest New Mexico as the three border regions where the barrier posed the greatest risk to wildlife. In Texas, for example, \\"the border barrier affects 60% to 70% of the habitat in the South Texas Wildlife Refuge Complex, which includes the Laguna Atascosa, Lower Rio Grande Valley, and Santa Ana National Wildlife Refuges.\\"  Executive Order 13767  left On January 25, 2017, President Donald Trump issued Executive Order 13767, directing construction of a U.S. border wall. Such a wall was not under construction, and Congress had not appropriated the funds to build such a wall.Matt Apuzzo, Trump Orders a Wall Built, but Congress Holds the Checkbook, New York Times (January 25, 2017). The construction of a border wall as envisioned in Trump's order would cause significant environmental damage, including habitat destruction and habitat fragmentation that would harm wildlife, including endangered species.Erika Bolstad, Trump's Wall Could Cause Serious Environmental Damage, E&E; News (republished in Scientific American) (January 26, 2017).Jamie Condliffe, Trump's Border Wall Will Be Awful for the Environment, MIT Technology Review (January 27, 2017).Darryl Fears, Endangered animals are already cut off by a border wall. Trump wants it to be much bigger, Washington Post (January 27, 2017). Wall construction would also cause increased greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to climate change, due to the concrete manufacturing that would be required. A 2017 study conducted by UNAM scientists found that more than 800 species, of which 140 are endangered, would be adversely affected if Trump's 2,000-mile-long border wall is built. The research concluded that the erection of \\"an impassable physical barrier placed into ecosystems\\" would \\"so disrupt patterns of migration as to cause a 'natural catastrophe.'\\" The bald eagle, grey wolf, armadillo and jaguar would be adversely affected.Alasdair Baverstock, Experts warn 800 species, many endangered, affected by border wall, Associated Press (April 10, 2017). The wall would adversely affect even some bird species, such as the ferruginous pygmy owl, which \\"rarely flies higher than 4.5 feet off the ground.\\"Clara Chaisson, El Jefe the Jaguar Is Also Not a ‚ÄúBad Dude\\", Natural Resources Defense Council (February 15, 2017). In April 2017, the Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental group, and U.S. Representative Ra√∫l M. Grijalva, the ranking Democratic member on the House Committee on Natural Resources filed a lawsuit in federal court in Tucson. In their complaint, Grijalva and the Center argue that the government's wall construction plans fail to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act, and seek to compel the government to carry out an environmental impact study and produce an environmental impact statement before building the wall.Rafael Carranza, Donald Trump's border wall faces first lawsuit, Arizona Republic (April 12, 2017).Lawsuit Targets Trump's Border Wall, Enforcement Program (press release), Center for Biological Diversity (April 12, 2017). The lawsuit specifically seeks \\"to stop any work until the government agrees to analyze the impact of construction, noise, light and other changes to the landscape on rivers, plants and endangered species‚Äîincluding jaguars, Sonoran pronghorns and ocelots‚Äîand also on border residents\\".Fernanda Santos, No Environmental Impact Study? No Border Wall, Lawsuit Says, New York Times (April 13, 2017). In addition to the Center for Biological Diversity, a number of other wildlife advocacy and environmental organizations have opposed construction of a border wall. These include the grassroots Sierra Club, which has called Trump's wall proposal \\"expensive, ineffective and environmentally devastating\\" and noted that existing walls already \\"block wildlife migration, cause flooding and damage pristine wild lands, including wildlife refuges, wilderness areas, and national forests\\"; the Natural Resources Defense Council;NRDC Stands in Solidarity with Immigrant and Refugee Communities (press release), Natural Resources Defense Council (January 25, 2017). and Panthera, which \\"opposes the construction of a border wall that would disturb the natural movement and dispersal patterns of wildlife.\\"  Environmental impacts  Also see Mexico‚ÄìUnited States border United States-Mexico border on the right highly industrialized border city of Tijuana, Mexico. On the left is San Diego, California's water treatment plant.  Toxic waste  Currently, the border has hazardous materials being transported across country lines. The La Paz Agreement, signed by Mexico and the United States in 1983, requires hazardous waste created by United States corporations to be transported back to the United States for disposal. However, due to the physical border wall and its effects the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reports that only 91 of the 600 manufacturing plants located along the Texas-Mexico border have returned hazardous waste to the United States since 1987. Industries in U.S.-Mexico border towns often illegally dump or burn wastes, causing water and air pollution and other forms of environmental degradation along the border. These industries are largely known as maquiladoras. The maquiladoras have been tested and were found to create air, soil and water pollution through their activities. Also, these industries are potential sites for industrial accidents. In 2013, a Ju√°rez maquila killed eight workers and caused injuries to many others. A 2003 report by the National Environmental Justice Advisory Council to the EPA noted that: \\"Abandonment of hazardous wastes has been a serious problem because of the apparent ease with which responsible parties have been able to avoid enforcement actions by crossing the border. While cooperation between U.S. and Mexican enforcement authorities should theoretically prevent such occurrences, complaints about abandoned or unremediated sites and the failure to hold the responsible parties accountable have been persistent.\\" Among the more infamous border hazardous-waste sites named in the report were Metales y Derivados, an abandoned lead battery recycling plant, and Alco Pacifico facility, both in Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico.  Water  Colorado river at Mexican border The border region poses major threats in losing essential water resources. Aquifers in particular are primary water sources for the bordering states which have been severely impacted by these water deficits. An estimate suggests that there are around 16 to 36 aquifers between these bordering countries. Due to mass climate change, droughts, and large population growths these aquifers are drying out. By year 2025, the Bolson Hueco Aquifer is expected to be depleted, this aquifer is a primary source of water for El Paso and Ciudad Ju√°rez. This in turn, has forced the bordering cities to rely on water from the Rio Grande. Consequently, residents living in the downriver cities east of El Paso, (whose primary source of water is the Rio Grande for uses such as cooking, bathing, and drinking) have been affected by the new distributions of water. Large water boundaries such as Rio Grande and the Santa Cruz river create natural borders between both nations. As noted in Executive Order 13767's text, the \\"'Southern border' shall mean the contiguous land border between the United States and Mexico, including all points of entry.\\" This would require the fragmentation of these rivers, which could cut the flow of water and wildlife between the two nations. The construction of this wall also questions the future of treaties signed between both nations such as the International Boundary and Water Commission and La Paz Agreement. Air pollution  Idling vehicles for long periods of time at border entries are significant in contributing the poor air quality along the border. Air pollution along the US-Mexico border is created through various outputs including vehicular emissions and industrial emissions. According to data found on the Bureau of Transportation Statistics in 2016 about 87,462,517 vehicles (Trucks, Personal Vehicles, Busses, and Trains) went through the border in the year 2016. According to Christoph Meinrenken, an associate research scientist at Columbia University's Earth Institute, a 1,000-mile (1,600-kilometer) wall would require an estimated 275 million cubic feet of concrete. It would release as much as 1.9 million metric tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.  Ecosystem fragmentation  There are a variety of ecosystems ranging from deserts and mountains to natural waterways along the US-Mexico border. The two deserts along the border region are fragile due to small disturbances or changes impacting plant and animal life in significant ways.Lieberman Goodwin, S. (2000, March 16). Conservation Connections in a Fragmented Desert Environment: The U.S.-Mexico Border. Retrieved April 14, 2017, from http://lasa.international.pitt.edu Ecosystems provide wide services such as: \\"...food, fiber, regulation of clean water and climate stability, physical protection from extreme events, including flooding and drought, pest mitigation, recreation, and educational and inspirational opportunities that are vital to the prosperity, safety and well-being of both the U.S. and Mexican public\\". Along the U.S.-Mexico border the ecosystem no longer functions in these patterns; instead it is going through degradation. In part degradation is caused by poor management of agricultural runoff, sewage waste contributing to coastal \\"dead zones\\", water withdrawals related to agriculture, mining, and rapid urbanization, military activities, and border enforcement. The Lower Rio Grande Valley National Wildlife Refuge and the Sabal Palm Audubon Center and Sanctuary are important ecological areas along the border.Eriksson, L., & Taylor, M. (2017). The Environmental Impacts of the Border Wall Between Texas and Mexico. Retrieved April 13, 2017, from https://law.utexas.edu  Endangered species  According to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, more than 100 species between California and Texas are listed as threatened and endangered under the Endangered Species Act. Jesse Lasky, an assistant professor of biology at Penn State University, led a study on the impact of barriers published in the journal Diversity and Distributions in 2011. The study's main conclusion was that the \\"new barriers would increase the number of species at risk\\". In New Mexico, for example, such a wall would prevent rare northern jaguars from entering suitable habitat in the southern part of the state from Mexico.Border wall could threaten endangered northern jaguar July 5, 2017  Human impacts   Indigenous communities  thumb Trans-border environmental issues negatively impact Indigenous communities and U.S. border tribes.These tribes depend on the natural environment for sustenance, survival, and ritual purposes. Various consequences seen for indigenous tribes include air pollution from off-reservation activity, traffic congestion, extraction of natural resources, and burning or illegal dumping of solid and hazardous waste.\\" In the U.S., several tribal communities rely on water and live within or near the bordering bi-national rivers and groundwater basins. These communities are often concerned about the pollution in these waters due to having limited response capabilities to respond to wastes or spills in their communities. The Tohono O'odham Nation is a tribal group composed of six indigenous villages live on the border region between Mexico and the United States. With the newest executive order by President Trump this group feels highly mortified by the possible fragmentation of their community and ancestral lands.  U.S. residents  Mexican immigrants are primarily concentrated in the West and Southwest, and more than half live in California or Texas. In January, The Trump Administration made public a plan to pay for the wall with a 20% tariff on Mexican imports. The border states, mainly California and Texas, have the largest imports from Mexico in the country. According to the US Census, Texan imports of Mexican goods were worth more than $84 billion in 2015. Accordingly, Texas would pay $16.8 billion more for the same goods and services. This tariff would negatively impact United States citizens‚Äîespecially those living in border areas. As of 2010, there were about 15 million people living in border counties on both sides of the Mexico-U.S. borders, with nearly 7.2 million residents on the United States side. The influx of workers needed to secure the Southern border would be in the thousands. While this would increase the economies of these border towns for a short time, eventually real estate prices would rise. This increase in value would push out many current residents of border towns, which are historically lower in property value. The construction of the wall would negatively impact lower income communities along the border in the long run.  Mexican residents  In Mexico, Grineski, etal. formed a research analysis on the patterns of environmental injustice in Tijuana. The study found that residents who live closer to these border regent areas had higher levels of flame retardants. This study extracted blood serum from children living in close proximity to the Mexican-US border industrialized zones and to other children living in rural, suburb areas or near landfills. \\"Apart from that finding, patterns of environmental injustice in Tijuana found that children and recent migrants were most at risk to industrial hazards near their homes.\\" Important to note is the mortality rate of those attempting to illegally cross the border. Since 2006, when the Secure Fence Act was introduced, crossing mortalities have exponentially increased. In the last 15 years, around 3,600-5,100 people have been killed attempting to cross the border. By 2009, the risk of dying while crossing the border in Arizona was 17 times greater than it was a decade earlier, according to one analysis by the American Civil Liberties Union. The current plans for increased border security will heighten this tension. Although illegal border crossings have decreased in recent years, mortalities while crossing have increased.

Foss is a rhetorical scholar and educator in the discipline of communication. Her research and teaching interests include contemporary rhetorical theory and criticism, feminist perspectives on communication, the incorporation of marginalized voices into rhetorical theory and practice, and the reconceptualization of communication theories and constructs.  History and background  Karen Foss and her twin sister, Sonja K. Foss, who is also a rhetorical scholar and educator in communication, were born in Portland, Oregon, on January 26, 1950, and grew up in Eugene, Oregon. Foss earned a B.A. in Romance Languages (Spanish and French) from the University of Oregon in 1972, an M.A. in Speech (Rhetoric and Public Address) from the University of Oregon in 1973, and a Ph.D. in Speech and Dramatic Art (Rhetoric and Public Address) from the University of Iowa in 1976. She taught at Humboldt State University (1976-1993) and the University of New Mexico (1993-2015), where she is now Regents professor emeritus. She served as director of Women Studies from 1978-1980 and 1989-1992 at Humboldt State University and from 1995-1997 at the University of New Mexico. She also served as department chair of Communication & Journalism at the University of New Mexico from 1997-2000 and 2013-2015. She served as a visiting associate professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst from 1984-1985 and as a Senior Specialist Fulbright Scholar to the University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark, in March 2007.  Scholarly work  Foss is the coauthor or coeditor of nine books, and she has published over seventy book chapters and essays in communication journals. Foss regularly presents her research at regional, national, and international conferences and has presented lectures in Denmark, Japan, Turkey, Argentina, and China and across the United States. She served for seven years (1981-1988) as the coeditor (with Sonja K. Foss) of the journal Women's Studies in Communication. Some of Foss's work provides overviews of rhetorical and communication theories. Contemporary Perspectives on Rhetoric (with Sonja K. Foss and Robert Trapp) summarizes the theories of 10 rhetorical theorists, including Kenneth Burke, bell hooks, Jean Baudrillard, and Michel Foucault. Theories of Human Communication, now in its 11th edition, summarizes theories across the communication discipline. Foss and Stephen W. Littlejohn also coauthored, in 2009, the Encyclopedia of Communication Theory, a two-volume set covering theorists, concepts, and applications of communication theories. In addition to compiling summaries of theories in communication, a primary focus of Foss's research program is a reconceptualization of communication concepts and theories from feminist perspectives. She is interested in how different assumptions, values, and marginalized speaking practices affect theories of communication. The impetus for much of this work was the feminist movements of the 1960s and 1970s that created awareness of the absence of women in the academy. Foss sought to introduce the study of women and gender into the communication discipline, illustrated by her essays on Deborah Sampson, the status of research on women and communication (with Sonja K. Foss), and personal experience as evidence in feminist scholarship (with Sonja K. Foss). She also helped bring the study of women's social movements into the discipline, exemplified by her essays about the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis in the contemporary women's movement (with Michael J. Schneider) and the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo (with Kathy L. Domenici). Another focus of Foss's feminist research program is the introduction of topics for study traditionally outside the purview of the communication discipline. Some of these deal with women's interests and concerns, traditionally excluded because of the singular focus of the discipline on men and their discourse. Women Speak: The Eloquence of Women's Lives (with Sonja K. Foss) offers one example of this work, showing how women's communication takes many forms outside of traditional speechmaking, from mothering to shopping to architecture to sewing. Other essays by Foss deal with topics such as women bullying women, sexual harassment, birth control, surrogacy, placenta practices, and marital names. She also advanced the inclusion of GLBTQ issues into the discipline, focusing in particular on the discourse of gay San Francisco supervisor Harvey Milk. The focus of Foss's most recent work has been how feminist perspectives can transform the communication discipline. She seeks to reconstruct and transform theories to provide a more expansive tool kit for communicators‚Äîone that does not rely solely on the speaking practices of elite white men. Her position is summarized in \\"Transforming Rhetoric Through Feminist Reconstruction: A Response to the Gender Diversity Perspective (with Sonja K. Foss and Cindy L. Griffin). She also offered the communication discipline, in Feminist Rhetorical Theories (with Sonja K. Foss and Cindy L. Griffin), examples of alternative theories that emerged from the ideas and activism of such feminist thinkers as Sally Miller Gearhart, Gloria Anzald√∫a, bell hooks, and Sonia Johnson. Inviting Transformation: Presentational Speaking for a Changing World (with Sonja K. Foss) is another example of Foss's efforts at reconceptualizing; here, Foss and Foss offer a new model of public speaking that incorporates principles of invitational rhetoric and the speaking practices of marginalized groups. In Gender Stories (with Sonja K. Foss and Mary E. Domenico), Foss reconceptualizes sex, gender, and feminism as social constructions. Foss also juxtaposes the paradigm of persuasion‚Äîthe dominant view of change in the discipline‚Äîwith an alternative approach drawn from a variety of other disciplines and traditions. Foss also has been interested in ways to advance pedagogy and practice in the communication discipline. She has developed strategies for to help students with communication anxiety and provided graduate students with strategies for navigating graduate education. Other efforts have centered on ways to incorporate feminist perspectives into classes. In addition, Foss has sought to devise new formats for the classroom, such as individualized instruction, that creatively address the needs of contemporary university students and make classroom instruction more relevant and engaging. Her essay on the use of documentary film to teach rhetorical theory is an example of this pedagogical focus.

Published in September 2014, it is Nelson's second novel. Nelson won several awards for this novel, including the 2015 Printz Award for Excellence in Young Adult Literature. In June 2015, Warner Bros. optioned the movie rights and Natalie Krinsky signed on to write the script. Denise Di Novi and Alison Greenspan were said to be producing the movie. The novel follows a set of twins, Jude and Noah. Although they were incredibly close at thirteen, three years later they are hardly speaking to each other. The early years are narrated by Noah as he struggles with an enormous secret that affects his past, present, and future. The later years are narrated by Jude as her life changes when she meets an arrogant and broken, yet beautiful boy. Jude also encounters a tormented, mysterious artist‚Äîan even more unpredictable force that changes her life, and Noah's, forever. Plot Noah and Jude Sweetwine are twins. As they enter their teen years, they grow apart. This is partly due to their sibling rivalry, as they compete for the attention of their mother, Dianna; and partly due to their struggle to be able to understand their separate identities. Furthermore, both twins want to apply to the same highly competitive art school. On one hand, Noah clearly revels in his artistic talent, while hiding the fact that he is crushing on a neighborhood boy named Brian. On the other hand, Jude is reserved about her art, but she openly welcomes male attention. The early years are written from Noah's point of view. By spying on her, Noah is aware of Jude's artistic abilities. However, he does whatever he can to keep their mother from discovering Jude's gift. One day, Dianna walks in on Noah and Brian, who freaks out because he is still in the closet and ends their relationship. Then Noah discovers his mother having an affair with a local sculptor, Guillermo Garcia. Noah runs away and leaves a drawing of the scene with Guillermo on Dianna's bed. Dianna talks with Noah and says that she is in love with Guillermo and wants to divorce Noah's father. The two fight and Dianna drives away to propose to Guillermo. On the way, she is killed in an automobile accident. Noah seeks Guillermo out to yell at him and lies by saying that his parents were planning to stay together. Furthermore, Noah is under the impression that his application to art school was rejected. He is lost, confused and still obsessed with Brian. The later years are written from Jude's point of view. Evidently, instead of ensuring both of their applications to art school were mailed out, Jude threw away Noah's application and only sent her own. Jude is not coping well with her mother's death. She is miserable in school and is nearly failing out. She is convinced that her mother's ghost is destroying all her art. Therefore, she finds Guillermo Garcia, whom she convinces to take her on as an apprentice. Jude wants to make stone sculptures that, she believes, her mother will be unable to demolish. Meanwhile, Jude finds herself hopelessly attracted to Oscar, a British boy whom Guillermo views as a son. Oscar flirts with Jude but she does not allow it to go far because she has sworn off boys. The day Dianna died, Jude was having sex for the first time. The experience was awful and Jude feels responsible for her mother's death. Working on her stone sculpture helps Jude process her problems. She knows that she needs to tell Noah about what she did with his art school application. Meanwhile, Noah has discovered that Guillermo is Jude's mentor. He is concerned that Jude will learn that Noah was responsible for their mother's accident. Hopelessly, Noah gets drunk during a drinking game and nearly commits suicide by jumping off a cliff. However, Jude and Oscar stop him. The twins talk and reveal all their secrets to each other. Noah reveals Dianna's affair with Guillermo and Jude tells him about the sabotaged art application. Guillermo is relieved Dianna still loved him when she died and wants to continue to mentor Jude. Oscar and Jude admit to their feelings for each other. Noah is finally accepted into art school, and he gets back together with Brian who is now openly gay. With all their misunderstandings cleared up, the twins are ready to reconnect and rebuild their relationship. Background When asked where she got the idea for I'll Give You the Sun, Nelson responds, \\"These characters ‚Äì Jude and Noah ‚Äì pretty much crash-landed in my brain, almost fully formed. They brought with them this tragedy and their 'first love' stories [...] The challenge became how to tell their really complicated story, because there is a lot going on between and among all these characters.\\" Nelson talks about the different writing process she used with this novel, saying, \\"The Sky Is Everywhere I wrote like a normal person, but for this book I wrote the entire thing in a pitch-black room with earplugs in. The only available light was the light coming from the computer screen [...] There was something about being in that dark room like a lunatic, not letting my world in at all, that allowed me to stay in their story.\\" Reception I'll Give You the Sun received strongly positive reviews. The New York Times praised the novel by calling it \\"[...] breathtaking. You get the sense her characters are bursting through the words, breaking free of normal metaphors and constructions, jubilantly trying to rise up from the prison of language.\\" The Guardian said that I'll Give You the Sun is \\"[...] about many things: grief, sexuality, creativity, bravery, identity, guilt. But mostly it's about love [...] This book will make you realize how beautiful words can be.\\" Awards *Winner of the 2015 Printz Award for Excellence in Young Adult Literature *A 2015 Stonewall Honor Book *Winner of Bank Street's 2015 Josette Frank Award *YALSA Top Ten Best Fiction for Young Adults *Rainbow List Top Ten 2015 References 2014 American novels American young adult novels American LGBT novels Gay male teen fiction 2010s LGBT novels Novels about artists Michael L.

Labour is defined as a task that is performed, typically for an economic return. Environment is defined as air, water, minerals, organisms, and all factors that contribute to ecology. It is the gregarious and cultural pressures that builds the lives of individuals or an entire population. Human labour in the forms of Logging, Mining, and Tourism, have negatively impacted the functions of the environment in various countries that are part of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) forum. The OECD is a list of 34 countries whose governments work together to ensure that the market economies function accordingly and strive to increase economic growth, wealth and sustainable development. The impacts of labour on the environment have been so large that many corporations and campaigns have begun, striving to change the way humans exert their abilities on the environment by implementing policies to limit negative outcomes. Logging, Mining and Tourism damage the environment without proper resource management practices. Logging has created such a negative effect on New Zealand in particular, that a 3 year ban had been placed on logging to attempt to preserve the environment and reconstruct it to its original structure. The effects are dated as far back as 1960. At the end of the second world war, there were about 100,000 hectares of native forest, whereas today there is less than 17,000 hectares remaining in West Taupo District in New Zealand and many endangered species that resided in these forests are now extinct as a cause of logging. In terms of mining, the conflicts that have surfaced in Peru revolve around the inexperience workers that are hired to perform these tasks that incur a greater damage to the environment as they are not aware of the harm they are doing. There is a weakness around the environmental regulation in comparison to mining and many companies have taken over and negatively affected the environment in order to invest their wealth into new mining operations. Furthermore, tourism has contributed a great amount of stress to the environment. When individuals from other countries are visiting these OECD countries that are under great distress with the environment and pollution, in many cases they provide more harm than good by littering or removing plants or flowers as a souvenir but are unaware that the souvenirs are part of an endangered species. The popularity of tourism has resulted in damage towards the environment in many ways. Tourism has led to the growth of airports, hotels, and other organizations that have stripped away land in order to build and grow in the economic sector. Although tourism can have a positive impact on the economy it results in an environmentally unsustainable model for many areas. The relationship between human labour and the environment and the types of work that humans have participated in have created a negative impact on many aspects of the environment including climate change and has resulted in the emerging green economy. The primary cause of climate change is humans and their work towards the environment overtime. A result of this has been the policies that have been put into place to ensure the environment will be protected moving forwards and to establish alternate routes for individuals when available to preserve the environment. The key focus is on the impact of human work on the environment, and the impact of the environment on human work. The green economy has emerged as a result of the negative outcomes. Specifically to Limpopo, Africa, there have been so many negative contributions affecting the way the environment functions that they have created a project to help reduce this issue. This project contributes to the green economy and has created policies that will be implemented to reduce negative outcomes and alternative routes when attaining energy, goods, infrastructure, etc.  Causes   Logging  thumb Logging has turned into a negative concept throughout many areas due to the way humans go about it. We have now relied on logging as a major contributor to our resources that it has been difficult to cut down and has turned into a negative factor. Specifically to New Zealand, there has been a 3 year ban put into place to try to conserve the environment and attempt to reconstruct the environment back to its original standards. This is because the West Taupo forest that is located in Pureora, is the last forest remaining causing a great deal of stress to preserve the land. The most serious issues surrounding these native forests have resulted in a socio-economic consideration as well as conservation problems. While viewing this issue in another light, conservationists are claiming that logging has already made too big of an impact to turn back. In spite of the many protests and bans that have been placed, logging throughout these forests is still taking place today. The effects of logging have also been negative on the rate of erosion throughout many places, specifically in the Philippines. Scientists have found that the rate of erosion in the Philippines has increased by four times due to conventional logging. Roads were one of the main outcomes of logging and although they only typically cover a small amount of the area being logged, they cover over 80% of the surface erosion.  Mining  thumb Over the course of many years, Peru specifically has been the main resources of copper, tin, silver, gold, zinc and natural gas. There has been many conflicts around labour in terms of the experience workers have prior to starting their job. Due to the high demand of workers in the mining industry, there has been a great deal of employees being hired with little to no work experience to perform these specific tasks. They are also less likely to change professions as they are being paid a large salary greater than professions that require a high deal of experience like health workers, and police officers, etc. These workers do not have any knowledge on the negative impacts that mining seems to have on the environment causing them to do more harm than good. There has also been a weakness around environmental regulation when it comes to mining in Peru. This is seen especially through the Ministry of Energy and Mines as they are responsible for the overall production and regulations with Mining. Their responsibilities are more often neglected as their main concern is wealth as opposed to the environment. Mining requires a great deal of site preparation and clearing at times. This can be a negative effect on the environment if they are performing this task through an ecologically sensitive area. Even prior to mining, many activities that are linked to the process of preparing the land for mining have a significantly negative effect on these sensitive areas. A result of human labour has effected the environment in terms of habitat loss throughout wildlife. Many species have been effected from mining companies stripping the land to benefit economically. This can also be effected when the homes of these species are being polluted with the wastes that derive from mining projects. Also, in terms of lakes and ponds, the fish and wildlife found inside these streams can be impacted if they are drained or polluted. The mining company has done more harm than good throughout many aspects of the environment, doing everything they can to gain an economic prosperity regardless of the environmental effects.  Tourism  Tourism has the ability to transform many areas into an economically beneficial project. It has become a major industry throughout all over the world regardless of the many stressors that can be contributed to the environment. Tourism can negatively effect the lives of indigenous people who may be depending on these resources to survive. When using nature as a resource for an economic benefit it negatively impact the lives of these indigenous individuals. thumb One of the major issues with tourism is the littering that tourists tend to contribute to. When tourists are littering they are not only effecting the environment but they are also effecting the animals among that ecosystem. The consumption of litter amongst these animals can result in illness and death. Not only can this factor into the land but also the organisms in the sea by breaking coral and also frightening animals or bringing illness and death among them. thumb Tourism has also impacted the environment when having to expand resources for the industry to grow. Tourism can link to the effects of logging, as there have been areas torn down in order to expand economically. Spain has gained an increasing number of tourists over the years resulting in them having to expand in airports and hotels. This resource has resulted in stripping the environment to create these commodities. While using the environment to grow in the tourism industry, this demonstrates the unsustainable model being implemented in order to grow. Many resources, land and water, have been negatively effected in the process of expanding.  Effects   Climate change  thumb Human labour on the environment have effected many factors, one being the ongoing issue of climate change. The main attempt is to establish different routes to maintain the overall state of the environment. This is done by creating policies to try to use alternative options for energy, goods, infrastructure, etc. Certain human labour activities highly affect climate change in terms of air pollution. Jobs that require transportation, electricity generation, and industrial processes release pollution throughout the air everyday. This can be through the high demand in imports and exports that require individuals to produce this pollution through their means of transporting these products. The Global Union Research Network has worked extensively in trying to find alternative routes for services to have a smaller impact on climate change. Tourism has been affected from climate change due to the rise of sea levels causing some businesses close to the sea to shut down as a safety hazard. These policies are influenced by the strategies used when dealing with climate change and many of the financial crises. Logging contributes to up to 15 percent of the carbon dioxide in the air. It is such a negative aspect towards the environment because when individuals are cutting down trees, they are releasing carbon out into the arm which then contributes to the greenhouse gases and global warming occurs. There has been more action taken place upon vehicles impacting the air then there is towards logging and vehicles produce about 14 percent of the carbon dioxide in the air, hinting that logging should be just as an important issue to the world. Between the years of 2000 and 2009, there were 32 million acres of tropical rainforest that had been cut down per year, and each year this rate has been increasing. Environmental Defence Fund states that unless something is done as an alternative route to logging, deforestation will release up to 200 billion tons of carbon dioxide into the air in the years coming. thumb Mining has contributed to many of the air pollutions being released into the air. When mining for these resources, inexperienced employees are creating many detrimental outcomes when mining in the wrong areas or hitting gas leaks. In specifics to coal mines, communities have no choice but to leave their land behind and move due to the expansion of these mines, and the water contamination from mining. These companies are very quick to attain any sort of product through mining that they do not realize the great damage left behind once they have extracted what they need. Acid mine drainage for instance, is just one of the issues that can continue on for decades, as a result of a minimal mining job. Many campaigns are doing their best to ensure that communities find alternative routes to renewable energy to preserve the environment and decrease climate change. Tourism has been greatly expanding over the years, and has also contributed a main factor of their expansion to climate change. By creating many of these new airports, attractions, etc, for tourists, it requires companies to tear down areas and rebuild a new company for the tourism industry to grow. Pollutants are being released in the air as these companies build new areas. There is a lack of knowledge around tourism and climate change which has been a leading factor in the detrimental outcomes of tourism towards the environment. Individuals continue to create new attractions for tourists to come see without realizing the consequences of their attraction towards the environment. Many individuals act out by only thinking of the short and medium term benefits of their attraction and pay no mind to the long term effects to the environment such as air pollution and overall land protection.  Emerging green economy  The emerging green economy is a way of trying to reduce resource consumption, destructive emissions, and overall reducing all types of negative impacts towards the environment. The green economy offers green products and services that benefit the environment. When the green economy first began to grow, there were 2 different approaches being taken, environmentally and economically. The environmental approach to this was to take all the negative environmental aspects into account and develop a sustainable route to each one through pricing, and land choices, etc. The economic perspective also known as short term growth perspective; was all about increasing jobs and incomes by investing in low carbon technologies to preserve the environment. More recently there has been a third approach to the green economy, equity and inclusion. This has been brought by developing countries, wanting the green growth approach to focus primarily on individuals and countries who are not part of the economic system. The green economy has been implemented in an attempt to preserve the environment. Policies in Limpopo, Africa, revolve around the needs of the economy and society to ensure it is maintaining its sustainable lifestyle. The Green Economy in Limpopo's main focus is to bring more jobs and increase the economy. The green economy attempts to create this lifestyle in many different countries and areas.

It became an executive order from the Obama administration number 13754 of December 9, 2016, to protect the countless indigenous coastal communities that rely on the strait for subsistence hunting, and the surrounding marine ecosystem's vitality. It exists within the U.S exclusive economic zone and within maritime boundaries agreed upon between the Soviet Union and the U.S. The ecosystem, civilization, and international trade all rely on each other, thus encouraging the establishment of the sensitive marine areas in the Bering Strait. The executive order was upheld by international climate goals, and environmental management standards. Since the location is an international interest, it became vital to protect this area from further exploitation in the oil and shipping industry.  Background  A map of the sanctioned resilience area, and lease withdrawal region This executive decision was a response to delegates from the Bering Sea Elders Group who sought advice from the administration. Considering Arctic biodiversity preservation, a sustainable economy, ecosystem coordination, and proper stewardship, international efforts from environmental managers and climate sciences became recently concerned with the Northern Bering Sea area. The Bering Sea is of particular significance and value due to it being the habitat of multiple large marine mammal migration paths . Anthropogenic factors have become a threat to the benthic habitat and overall Arctic ecosystem which has had an effect on indigenous tribes such as the Yup‚Äôik, Cup‚Äôik and Inupiaq peoples. To ensure the functioning of the human-environment interaction in the Northern Bering Sea, resilience government methods were implemented by the Obama Administration.  Arctic Climate Change Issues   Sea Ice recession  Due to abnormal weather patterns and warming temperatures in the Arctic and Northern Bering Sea region, sea ice has receded making larger areas of navigable waters available to shipping vessels. The heavy reliance of the indigenous people on the marine environment is now vulnerable with the lack of sea ice during critical points in the seasons. The sea ice loss not only affects the surrounding marine ecosystem but also the local coastal communities making the shoreline vulnerable to storm surges and increased erosion. This has created a double hazard for the marine species populations in the region, with their environment slowly disappearing and also increased ship traffic increasing marine casualties from ship strikes.  Policy Breakdown   Lease Withdrawal  I hereby withdraw from disposition by leasing for a time period without specific expiration the following areas of the Outer Continental Shelf: (1) the area currently designated by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management as the Norton Basin Planning Area; and (2) the Outer Continental Shelf lease blocks within the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management's St. Matthew-Hall Planning Area lying within 25 nautical miles of St. Lawrence Island. The boundaries of the withdrawn areas are more specifically delineated in the attached map and, with respect to the St. Matthew-Hall Planning Area, the accompanying table of withdrawn Outer Continental Shelf lease blocks. Both the map and table form a part of this order, with the table governing the withdrawal and withdrawal boundaries within the St. Matthew-Hall Planning Area. This withdrawal prevents consideration of these areas for future oil or gas leasing for purposes of exploration, development, or production. This withdrawal furthers the principles of responsible public stewardship entrusted to this office and takes due consideration of the importance of the withdrawn area to Alaska Native tribes, wildlife, and wildlife habitat, and the need for regional resiliency in the face of climate change. Nothing in this withdrawal affects rights under existing leases in the withdrawn areas. The above quote states word for word from the executive order the details of the withdrawal of oil exploration and exploitation to prevent further anthropogenic harm to the Northern Bering Sea marine region. This withdrawal will also prevent further oil spill damage to the surrounding areas by reducing the exploitation of oil and benthic habitat disturbance. The USCG (U.S Coast Guard) was said to have been working in compliance with the National Contingency Plan to prepare the village first responders with the best possible means.  Traditional knowledge in decision making  The functioning of the surrounding Bering Sea ecosystem has a reciprocating relationship from the perspective of the coastal Alaskan tribe communities who rooted their culture around the ecosystem. The Obama Administration included traditional knowledge and Alaskan NGO outreach in the executive decision. The Intergovernmental Tribal Advisory Council was the first of its kind established to ensure traditional knowledge of the indigenous communities was included in federal decision making for the continuation in the Bering Sea Resilience Area protection initiatives.Sea ice seasonal variations. In recent years the amount of sea ice that survives the summer warming period has become smaller, and the warming periods have been increasing in length.

This stump is reputed to be the largest stump of Callixylon in the world. Discovery The Callixylon tree was discovered by John Fitts in 1913 at a farm near Goose Creek, south of Jesse, Oklahoma, in section 26, T. 1 N., R. 7 E. The fossil was found near the Giant Fitts Oilfield. The petrified stump was the largest of its species to ever be discovered. The Callixylon tree is an example of Callixylon whiteanum, a species of extinct trees found in the late Devonian period. It was later discovered to be a member of the same family as the genus Archaeopteris. It was a series of pieces that were eventually reconstructed to form a full eight foot tall stump. Conflict For twenty-three years (1913‚Äì1936) the Smithsonian in Washington D.C. and East Central University were vying for possession of the Callixylon tree. David White, head of the U.S. Geological Survey and Curator of Paleobotany at the Smithsonian Institution came from Washington D.C. to examine the fossil and decided it should be displayed at the Smithsonian, not ECU. ECU supporters raised money for erecting the tree fragments into a tree shape and moving it to campus. White died before enough funds had been raised to move the tree to the Smithsonian and as a result the tree was given to East Central University as a gift and memorial. The Callixylon tree was formally accepted by president of ECU at the time, President Linscheid in March, 1936. The plaque at the base of the tree is dedicated to White. The Callixylon tree stump, partially reconstructed, is currently on display at the entrance to East Central University's campus. Plaque center This is the plaque placed at the base of the Callixylon Tree in memorial of David White. It reads as follows: CALLIXYLON TREE OF DEVONIAN AGE PONTOTOC COUNTY, OKLAHOMA.

Rakow (born April 17, 1952) is a professor emerita of communication at the University of North Dakota and author of Gender on the Line: Women, the Telephone, and Community Life (1992). In 2000, she was identified as a top woman scholar in journalism and mass communication, and her research results were reported by the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication on the Status of Women. She also has numerous other published works that are primarily in the fields of communication and feminist theory. Rakow was born in North Dakota, where she spent a majority of her life as a student and, later, as a professor, writer, and researcher. As of June 2016, Rakow is in retirement from her position at University of North Dakota. She is currently the Associate Editor of the Journalism and Mass Communication Quarterly. Rakow has continued to research, write, and travel in her retirement. Education and career Rakow began her secondary education in her home state at the University of North Dakota. There, she graduated in 1974 with degrees in both Journalism and Humanities. She pursued her master's degree at UND as well, earning a degree in American Literature with a minor in English Language in 1977. During this time, she taught as a graduate assistant within the English department. From 1981 ‚Äì 1985, Rakow taught first as an assistant professor of Journalism at Franklin College in Indiana and then as a graduate assistant in the College of Communications at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. She later earned her Ph.D at the latter school in Communication Cultural Studies in 1987. Rakow's long-term career as a professor and researcher began at the University of Wisconsin-Parkside where she was an assistant professor from 1980 ‚Äì 1986 and an associate professor from 1990 ‚Äì 1994 in the department of Communication. Finally, she returned to the University of North Dakota, where she taught Communications from 1994 until her retirement in 2016. During this time, she also served as the founder and director of the Center for Community Engagement. In 1984, Rakow became an associate of the Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press (WIFP). WIFP is an American nonprofit publishing organization. The organization works to increase communication between women and connect the public with forms of women-based media.  Scholarly Work  The focus of Lana Rakow's research deals largely with subjects such as communication, feminist theory (the extension of feminism into theoretical, fictional, or philosophical discourse.)Brabeck, M. and Brown, L. (with Christian, L., Espin, O., Hare-Mustin, R., Kaplan, A., Kaschak, E., Miller, D., Phillips, E., Ferns, T., and Van Ormer, A.) 'Feminist theory and psychological practice Archived 2018-06-09 at the Wayback Machine', in J. Worell and N. Johnson (eds.) Shaping the future of feminist psychology: Education, research, and practice (Washington, D.C.: American Psychological Association, 1997), pp.15-35, and technology. One of her major works, Gender on the Line: Women, the Telephone, and Community Life (1992), combines all three of these subjects. Rakow's book, based on her dissertation at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Chaimpaign, looks at the way that women use telephones as a form of communication. Her research, conducted using personal interviews with women in Prospect, Illinois, sheds light on the complexity of women's use of telephones through the feminist perspective. Gender on the Line received the 1993 Book Award from the Organization for the Study of Communication, Language and Gender. Another one of Rakow's published works that is also written from the feminist perspective is an article titled \\"Rethinking Gender Research in Communication\\" from the Journal of Communication. This article, published in 1986, examines how gender has historically been addressed in communication research and combines it with the way feminist theory addresses gender. The point of this particular work from Rakow is to assert that gender research in communication should look at gender as evolving social systems created through communication, rather than as simple categories used to compare communication in men and women. In order to change this thinking and adapt gender research, Rakow argues that other social sciences disciplines and especially feminist theory need to be incorporated in to research in the field of communications.

Foss is a rhetorical scholar and educator in the discipline of communication. Her research and teaching interests are in contemporary rhetorical theory and criticism, feminist perspectives on communication, the incorporation of marginalized voices into rhetorical theory and practice, and visual rhetoric.  History and background  Sonja Foss and her twin sister, Karen A. Foss, also a rhetorical scholar and educator in communication, were born in Portland, Oregon, on January 26, 1950, and grew up in Eugene, Oregon. Foss earned a B.A. in Romance Languages (French and Spanish) from the University of Oregon in 1972, an M.A. in Speech (Rhetoric and Public Address) from the University of Oregon in 1973, and a Ph.D. in Communication Studies from Northwestern University in 1976. She taught at Virginia Tech (1977-1978); Norfolk State University (1978-1980); the University of Denver (1980-1986); the University of Oregon (1986-1989); St. Louis University (1989-1990); Ohio State University (1990-1996); and the University of Colorado Denver (1997‚Äìpresent), where she served as chair of the Department of Communication from 1997-2003.  Scholarly Work  Foss is the author, coauthor, or coeditor of nine books, and she has published over fifty book chapters and essays in communication journals. Foss regularly presents her research at regional and national conventions and has presented lectures on her work in Sweden and China. She served for seven years (1981-1988) as the coeditor (with Karen A. Foss) of the journal Women's Studies in Communication and serves on the editorial boards of various communication journals. Some of Foss's work provides overviews of contemporary rhetorical theories and guidelines for analyzing rhetoric. Contemporary Perspectives on Rhetoric (with Karen A. Foss and Robert Trapp) summarizes the theories of ten rhetorical theorists, including Kenneth Burke, bell hooks, Jean Baudrillard, and Michel Foucault. Her textbook Rhetorical Criticism: Exploration and Practice offers various methods for analyzing rhetorical artifacts, including the cluster, ideological, metaphoric, and narrative methods. Although some of Foss's work provides accessible ways into conventional theories of and methods for studying rhetoric, the primary focus of her research is on reconceptualizing communication concepts and theories. She often takes a communication theory or concept and asks what it would look like if it were built on different assumptions, different values, different kinds of symbols, or the speaking practices of previously marginalized groups. Foss's work in the area of feminist perspectives on communication is one way in which she reconceptualizes communication theory and practice. When she entered the communication discipline in the 1970s, a period characterized by \\"womanless communication,\\" there \\"was nothing in the curriculum about women or feminism.\\" Her early efforts in this area were designed largely to introduce the communication discipline to great women speakers and social movements involving women in an effort to make them legitimate data for study. These efforts are illustrated by her articles on women priests in the Episcopal Church and the debate on the Equal Rights Amendment. Foss's later feminist work has been concerned with transforming \\"the communication discipline as a result of feminist understandings, insights, and scholarship.\\" She calls herself a feminist reconstructionist in that she seeks to reconstruct communication theories and concepts that are based on patriarchal values and assumptions and the speaking practices of elite white men. Her objective is to create \\"a more comprehensive description of communication processes‚Äîto describe as fully as possible the diverse communicative experiences that characterize symbol use in all of its variety.\\" She also wants \\"to challenge and transform the ideology of domination that pervades Western culture,\\" so she is interested in assessing theories and practices to see which of them re- inscribe this ideology and how they might be transformed. The theory of invitational rhetoric, which Foss developed with Cindy L. Griffin, is an example of her reconceptualization work from a feminist perspective. The theory reconceptualizes the definition of rhetoric and challenges the assumption that all rhetoric is designed to persuade. A similar project is Feminist Rhetorical Theories (with Karen A. Foss and Cindy L. Griffin), in which the rhetorical theories of nine feminist theorists such as Sally Miller Gearhart, Gloria Anzald√∫a, and Sonia Johnson are explicated, providing the communication field with alternatives to traditional rhetorical theories. Inviting Transformation: Presentational Speaking for a Changing World, written with Karen A. Foss, is another example of Foss's efforts at reconceptualizing; in this textbook, Foss and Foss present a new model of public speaking that incorporates invitational principles and the speaking practices of marginalized groups. Foss's article on two paradigms of change, written with Karen A. Foss, is another example of her reconceptualization efforts. In this article, Foss and Foss propose an alternative to the paradigm of persuasion that characterizes how change traditionally has been conceptualized in the communication discipline. Foss's work on the visual image as communication is another way in which she questions and reconceptualizes communication theories and concepts. When visual images are used as the data of studies, she suggests, theories of communication must be expanded to encompass these different types of symbols. Examples of her work in this area are studies of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, visual argumentation, the appeal of visual images and her proposal for a method for evaluating visual images. Foss also assists graduate students and faculty members develop into successful academic writers, helping to demystify the academic writing and publishing process. She is the author, with William Waters, of Destination Dissertation: A Traveler's Guide to a Done Dissertation, in which travel is used as a metaphor for writing a dissertation. She is the founder of Scholars' Retreat, writing retreats that provide individualized assistance for those who want to complete their theses, dissertations, and other academic publications.

It is famous for the depiction of John the Evangelist, the last work by the Italian medieval artist Cimabue. It is also the only work of his, which is dated and has historical documentation attributing it to Cimabue. Cimabue took over the work on the mosaic after Francesco da Pisa, who completed the figure of Christ. Cimabue worked on the mosaic for 94 days until 19 February 1302 and was specifically stated to have finished the figure of St. John by that date. The whole mosaic, including the figure of Virgin, was only completed by the third artist, Vincino da Pistoia in 1321, almost 20 years after Cimabue's death. The attribution to Cimabue is possible due to documented weekly payments of 10 soldi to the artist. The work eventually went through four renovations and survived the fire of 1595.

The mill dates back to at least 1289 but the oldest of the existing buildings are from the 1600s while the main building is from c. 1700. The building complex comprise three buildings; a main building from c. 1700, a stables from the 1600s and a malt mill from 1782. Originally constructed on Vestergade in the Indre by neighborhood it has since been moved to the Old Town Museum where it is now used as the main administrative building and for some museum-related workshops. Many places in Aarhus has been named for the mill; the Aarhus river used to be called M√∏lle√•en (Mill-river) and there was a large pond by the mill known as M√∏lledammen (Mill pond). The city gate M√∏lleport (Mill Gate) lay on the corner of Vester Alle and Vestergade. Until 1910 a part of Vestergade was called M√∏llegade (Mill Street). Present day M√∏lleparken (Mill Park) was created on the old pond used by the mill.  History  Aarhus Mill was built at some point in the early Middle Age. The exact date is not known but it is mentioned for the first time in records from 1289 and later in 1581 when a new mill was built. The mill was built on the Aarhus river west of Aarhus and east of Brabrand Lake and was mainly used for malt and flour production. In the later Middle Age it became illegal to mill products privately and farmers were forced to use one of the official, royally recognized mills, including √Örhus Mill. In 1861 the mill was converted from water power to steam power but a few years later, in 1873, the flour production stopped as machines became more common during the Industrial Revolution. The mill remained in use to some extent until 1913. In 1926 the mill was bequeathed to the Old Town Museum when the last owner of it died. The four main buildings were moved to the Old Town in 1928 and today houses the administration and several workshops. In 1849 one of the buildings burned down and during the cleanup a rune stone was discovered in the foundation. The stone was salvaged and is today displayed at Moesg√•rd Museum which also uses the motif of the stone as its logo. The stone is known as \\"√Örhusstenen\\" (The Aarhus Stone) or \\"Maskestenen\\" (The Mask Stone).  Architecture  The main building is from around 1700, designed with Baroque style elements. It is a half-timbered structure designed with two lower wall studs and one upper stud which was typical for the early Baroque in the Danish provincial cities in Jutland. The pronounced cornice is also characteristic for Baroque buildings. The color palette of grey-blue lumber with yellow panels and red joints are from around 1800.

It served in the Battle of Moscow and during the winter counteroffensive was assigned to 4th Shock Army, where it would remain, apart from one brief reassignment, until the beginning of 1945, a remarkably long time under a single army's command. During this offensive it helped carve out Toropets Salient, where it would remain until late in 1943 when it made a limited breakthrough to the west, with its army, in the area of Nevel. Throughout this period it shared a similar combat path with 334th Rifle Division. Near the start of the 1944 summer offensive 332nd was given credit for its role in the liberation of Polotsk and got its name as an honorific. The unit continued to give very creditable service for the duration of the war, distinguishing itself in the fighting through the Baltic states, and completing its combat path there. It continued to serve briefly into the postwar period. Formation The division began forming as the Ivanovo Militia Division on August 8, 1941, in the city of that name in the Moscow Military District. On August 20 it was re-designated as a regular army unit,Walter S. Dunn, Jr., Stalin's Keys to Victory, Stackpole Books, Mechanicsburg, PA, 2006, p. 78 but it retained the honorific title \\"Ivanovo, in the name of M.V. Frunze\\". Its primary order of battle was as follows: * 1115th Rifle Regiment * 1117th Rifle Regiment * 1119th Rifle Regiment * 891st Artillery Regiment * 268th Antitank BattalionCharles C. Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", Soviet Rifle Divisions Formed From June to December 1941, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. IX, Nafziger, 1996, p. 79 Since the militia division was supposed to include both a self- propelled artillery and a tank company, it's possible it inherited some non- standard weaponry. The division included some 2,700 Communist Party members and Komsomols, giving it a good cadre of determined, if not trained, personnel.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 79 These men were also noted at the time as being 100% Russian nationals.David M. Glantz, Colossus Reborn, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2005, p. 594 On August 28 Colonel Sergei Alekseevich Knyazkov was appointed to command the division, a position he would hold until April 8, 1942. Like the 331st Rifle Division, elements of 332nd took part in the famous November 7 October Revolution anniversary parade on Red Square in Moscow. Combat service At the beginning of December, 332nd was in the main defensive zone of the Moscow Defense ZoneSoviet General Staff, The Battle of Moscow, ed. & trans. R.W. Harrison, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2017, Kindle ed., part III, ch. 8 before being reassigned to 10th Army in the Western Front later that month.Dunn, Jr., Stalin's Keys, p. 78 Later that month it was moved north by rail and assigned to the newly formed 4th Shock Army in Northwestern Front. When 4th Shock attacked in January 1942, the division was noted as being at full strength for the tables of organization, but attacking in winter with marginal supplies, artillery and armor support soon changed that.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 79 The German forces in this sector were in even more dire straits, and 332nd helped 4th Shock, and its running mate, 3rd Shock Army, drive deep into the left flank of Army Group Center, liberating Toropets and advancing almost to Velikiye Luki before finally running out of steam. 4th Shock would remain in this general area, just north of Velizh, until November, 1943, in Kalinin Front. Lt. Col. Tikhon Nikolaievich Nazarenko took command of the division on April 9, and would remain in this post, without promotion, until December 2, 1943. Had Operation Mars in November 1942, fared better, 332nd would likely have taken part in an operation code-named either Jupiter or Neptune to destroy all of Army Group Center east of Smolensk.Glantz, After Stalingrad, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2009, pp. 41-42, 473 On October 1, 1943, the division was in 92nd Rifle Corps in 4th Shock Army. Following the liberation of Smolensk on September 25, the commander of Kalinin Front, Gen. A.I. Yeryomenko, planned a renewed drive toward Vitebsk, with a supporting operation toward Nevel, primarily by 3rd Shock with the support of 4th Shock. 3rd Shock gained success east of Nevel that was surprising to both sides on October 6. After a 90-minute artillery preparation with airstrikes, the German 2nd Luftwaffe Field Division, on the northernmost flank of Army Group Center, was routed; 263rd Infantry Division of Army Group North was also badly damaged and 3rd Shock Army poured into the gap. By October 10, Nevel had been liberated. Meanwhile, 4th Shock made significantly less progress towards Vitebsk. 92nd Rifle Corps, with 332nd and 358th Rifle Divisions, a rifle brigade, a tank battalion, and at least four penal companies, directed towards Velizh, made very little progress in this direction before the offensive was shut down.Glantz, Battle for Belorussia, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2016, pp. 26, 36-50 Later in October the Kalinin Front was renamed as the Baltic Front, and 10 days later as 1st Baltic Front. Late that month the division was transferred, with its corps, to 43rd Army, as Yeryomenko prepared for another offensive on the axis Gorodok - Vitebsk. The task of 92nd Corps was to protect the army's right flank to the boundary of 4th Shock Army, as the rest of the army attacked to the west. The offensive began on November 8, and although it made a few tactical penetrations of the German lines and gained ground to within 10 km east of Vitebsk by November 17, it stalled there. On December 3, Lt. Col. Nazarenko handed his command to Col. Tikhon Fyodorovich Yegoshin, who would be promoted to Major General on July 29, 1944. Not long afterwards, 332nd was transferred back to 4th Shock, now in 91st Rifle Corps,Glantz, Belorussia, pp. 135-42, 335 where it remained briefly until transferred to 60th Rifle Corps in February 1944, then to 83rd Rifle Corps before the summer offensive. At the start of the Baltic Campaign in early July 1944, 332nd was holding a sector of the Drissa River, facing the German Panther Line defenses about 25 km northeast of Polotsk.Baltic Gap, Multi-Man Publishing, Inc., Millersville, MD, 2009, p. 9 On July 4, the division was recognized for its role in liberating the city of Polotsk, and was given that name as an honorific: By the end of the month 332nd had reached the vicinity of Daugavpils, which was liberated on the 27th.Baltic Gap, p. 22 On August 1, the division's commander, Major-General Yegoshin, who had been promoted three days before, died of wounds received from enemy shellfire. On that date the division was conducting an assault crossing of the Western Dvina River when German forces launched a counterattack against 1119th Rifle Regiment, which cost the regiment seven men killed and 27 wounded. Yegoshin was mortally wounded at 1330 hrs. while directing the defense from the midst of his deployed regiment.Aleksander A. Maslov, Fallen Soviet Generals, ed. and trans. D.M. Glantz, Frank Cass Publishers, London, 1998, pp. 154-55 He was replaced by Col. Ivan Ivanovich Savchenko. By mid-September the formations of 4th Shock had advanced as far west as Birzhai, in northern Lithuania, as the Riga Offensive was beginning. Three weeks later a further advance had brought it to the Zhagare area, and while the Courland Pocket was being formed,Baltic Gap, pp. 29, 35 the 332nd, with its army, was taking part in the Battle of Memel and cutting off Army Group North for good. On October 22 the division was recognized for its role in the liberation of Riga with the award of the Order of Suvorov. On November 24, Col. Sergei Sergeiivich Ivanov took command of the 332nd, which he would hold for the duration of the war. Operations in 1945 In January 1945, the 332nd finally left 4th Shock, and was reassigned to 6th Guards Army, still in 1st Baltic Front. In 1945 the Soviet commands in the southern Baltic States were in constant flux, as both the assault on K√∂nigsberg and the reduction or containment of the Courland Pocket were attempted simultaneously. In March the division was moved to 42nd Army, facing the Courland group. In the last month of the war the division was in 23rd Guards Rifle Corps, in 67th Army of Leningrad Front on the Gulf of Riga.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 80 Postwar By the conclusion of hostilities, the division had been awarded the full title of 332nd Rifle, Volunteer, Ivanovo-Polotsk, Order of Suvorov, Division, in the name of M.V.

She then went to New York University (NYU) and received a Bachelors of Arts (B.A.) in Spanish Literature upon graduating in 1975. She continued on to pursue graduate degrees: In 1980, L√≥pez received a Masters of Arts (M.A.) in Anthropology, and in 1985 she attained a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.), also in Anthropology. Both of her graduate degrees were from Columbia University. She completed her Post Doctorate study at the University of Hawai'i at Manoa, Department of Anthropology, in 1995.  Career  L√≥pez has been Chair of the Sociology Department (2013-2016) at the Colin Powell School for Civic and Global Leadership at The City College of New York, part of the City University of New York (CUNY). There, she also serves as Director of the program in Latin American and Latino Studies, and is affiliated with the Women's Studies Program. She is also a Council Member on The City College Council for Inclusive Excellence.  Academic involvement and research interests  L√≥pez's main focuses surround the field of feminist anthropology and its intersection with Latin American identity and ethnicity. Latinx issues revolving around gender and education (specifically Puerto Rican women in the United States) have been topics of interest for the Professor, as well as subject matter with themes such as reproductive and pre-natal rights, and sterilization abuse. Overall, \\"many of her works include aspects of both [Puerto Rican Women in the United States and gender], focusing on interactions between history, socioeconomic class, ethnicity, community, and reproductive choice\\" L√≥pez also lectures at a variety of higher education institutions, where she speaks on feminist anthropology, specifically reproductive rights and freedoms. L√≥pez is an involved member of the American Anthropological Association (AAA). In December 2009, she was both an Organizer and Chair of, and Participant in, discussions on Gender, Health, and the Politics of Reproduction. L√≥pez can be used as an academic resource for the Society for Medical Anthropology's urban and applied anthropology sections. L√≥pez is a member of The Latina Feminist Group. This group co-authored Telling to Live: Latina Feminist Testimonios. The Center for Puerto Rican Studies at Hunter College (CENTRO), hosted some of these women, including L√≥pez, as guest speakers to discuss their publication via an offshoot of their program called \\"centroTALKS\\". These are \\"dialogues on issues concerning Puerto Ricans and Latinos\\". In March 2012 (Women's History Month), Queens College (a college of The City University of New York) held their annual Virginia Frese Palmer Women's Studies Conference. That year's topic was reproductive justice, and Professor L√≥pez was one of six other panelists to speak.  Publications  L√≥pez published one ethnography, Matters of Choice: Puerto Rican Women's Struggle for Reproductive Freedom, in 2008. This book spans 25 years and 3 generations of Puerto Rican families living in New York City, many of whom are poor and do not have high degrees of education. The study focuses on women who have undergone sterilization (either tubal ligation, hysterectomy, or both) and narrates each family's story, from the first to the third generation. Themes in the ethnography include sterilization abuse, but also family ties and gender roles and expectations. Aside from the family narratives, this ethnography provides historical context of the influence the United States had on Puerto Rican legislature, as well as historical context regarding eugenics and the Malthusian approach towards birth control and population control. L√≥pez co-authored a full-length book entitled Telling to Live: Latina Feminist Testimonies in 2001 with fellow members of The Latina Feminist Group.

Description Pityrodia gilruthiana is a spreading shrub which grows to a height of about and which has branches sticky due to the presence of branched, glandular hairs. The leaves are linear to narrow lance-shaped, glabrous but sticky, long, wide, darker green on the upper surface and have a prominent mid-vein on the lower surface. The flowers are fragrant and stalkless, arranged singly in upper leaf axils with a leaf-like bract and leafy, narrow linear to lance- shaped sticky bracteoles long at their base. The sepals are long and joined for less than half their length to form a bell-shaped tube with five lance- shaped lobes on the end. The lobes are lance-shaped, long, hairy and sticky except that the inside of the tubular part is glabrous. The five petals are long and joined to form an almost cylindrical tube long with five lobes on the end. The tube is off-white in colour with deep purple streaks on the upper lip. The lobes form two \\"lips\\" - the upper one with two lobes and the lower one longer with three lobes. The outer, top part of the tube has soft hairs but the rest is mostly glabrous apart from a dense hairy ring below the stamens. The lobes are more or less egg-shaped, the upper ones long and the lower ones are slightly longer and more spreading. The four stamens extend slightly beyond the end of the tube, the lower pair slightly longer than the other one. Flowering occurs in from February to August and is followed by an oval-shaped, hairy, fruit long.

Agenda Issues discussed during the summit included laying the foundations for a common Balkan market, increasing regional cooperation, improving and expanding infrastructure and energy services, curbing migration, and fighting corruption, terrorism, and radicalism. Plans drawn up during the summit included a Connectivity Agenda, a regional economic integration plan, private sector development, and expanding people-to-people contacts. Investments totaling greater than 500 million euros from the European Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development were agreed upon by the participants. The talks of Germany and the EU funding infrastructure and rebuilding less-developed areas in the region has been compared to The Marshall Plan, being dubbed The Balkan Marshall Plan. Connectivity Infrastructure is slated to be harmonized and built with EU regulations within the region, alongside repairs and updates to existing infrastructure. Regional Economic Integration The foundations for a common Balkan market were agreed upon. The summit leaders decided to focus on mostly investing in start-ups and scale-ups. The region also started on the path to integration within the pan-European digital market. To help facilitate this process, the Chamber Investment Forum of the Western Balkans was created. Johannes Hahn stated the economic integration and lowering of tariffs could produce up to 80,000 jobs.

Terminology In Norway, this term primarily applies to farms deserted due to the Black Death in 1349 and 1350.Store norske leksikon: √∏deg√•rd.Seljedal, Ivar. 1966. Sunndalsboka. Sunndal: Sunndal, √òksendal og √Ölvundeid sogelag, p. 35. In many cases, the description of the farm as √∏de 'deserted' became part of the farm name for posterity when the farms gradually came back into use again. Examples of such names include √òder√• and Kroksund√∏garden (both in Hole), √òde-Rud (in Nannestad), Hole-√òdeg√•rden (in Ringerike), √òde-Hval (in Ringerike and Modum), and simply √òdeg√•rden (e.g., in Fredrikstad). A contracted variant of the name is √òygard (in Grimstad) or √òygarden (in S√∏gne). The term √∏deg√•rd is also used in Denmark, where starting in the 1950s Copenhagen residents began looking for abandoned and deserted small farms in Sweden that they could buy or rent and use for the summer.Sp√∏rgsm√•l og svar, √∏deg√•rde.dk History After the plague epidemics of the 1300s, the population of Norway fell by up to 64%.Bray, R. S. 2004. Armies of Pestilence: The Impact of Disease on History. Cambridge: James Clarke & Co., p. 61. Because of the reduced population, people abandoned the lowest-quality and most isolated farms, working the better and more central farms instead. In the 1500s the population started growing again, and over the course of 150 years the population tripled in size. In order to support and house the continually increasing number of people, the deserted farms started being used again. There were conflicts over the ownership of the deserted farms, with questions about who actually owned them after they had sat abandoned for 200 years. Landowners claimed deserted farms in their area as their own. Land that had no owner was assigned to the crown. Those that cleared the old deserted farms therefore rented the land.Sandmo, Erling. 2015. Bondesamfunnet i vekst. Norgeshistorie.no. There was an abundance of land until the end of the 1600s. Then competition for resources began again, creating the basis for a new underclass of crofters.Orning, Hans Jacob. 2015. √òdeg√•rdene. Norgeshistorie.no. Taxation Deserted farms in Norway were exempt from taxes for a transitional period after farming operations were resumed. After that, the farm enjoyed a special low tax rate.

They have been made since the late 1960s. The badges are produced by the Mansudae Art Studio. There are more than 20 different designs, some of which are more sought-after than others. Ordinary North Koreans wear simple designs with a portrait of Kim Il-sung, whereas those higher up in the society prefer badges that have both Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il portrayed. The badges were inspired by Chairman Mao badges. Unlike their Chinese counterparts, which were never compulsory to wear, the North Korean badges have been a mandatory part of the attire for most of their history. As such, they are culturally more important than Mao badges ever were, and are a key part of North Korea's cult of personality. According to Jae-Cheon Lim, the badges are: They have also been compared to cross necklaces worn by Christians as a sign of devotion to a cause, increasing the parallels drawn overall between religion and the North Korean cult of personality. History A Kim Il-sung badge and a North Korean flag emblem on a jacket The inspiration for the badges were Chairman Mao badges worn by the Chinese during the Cultural Revolution, although North Korean propaganda attributes the idea to Kim Jong-il. It has been suggested by high-ranking defector Hwang Jang-yop that the Kapsan Faction Incident in 1967 triggered the systematic intensification of Kim Il-sung's cult of personality in general and the introduction of the badges in particular. Badges bearing the portrait of Kim Il-sung first appeared in the late 1960s when the Mansudae Art Studio started making them for Workers' Party of Korea cadres, who started wearing them after the Kapsan Faction Incident. Mass-production followed in November 1970, after a decree by Kim Il-sung. The very first badges with portraits were produced by the party's Propaganda and Agitation Department. This batch of badges featured \\"a stern-looking portrait of Kim Il Sung with his mouth firmly closed\\". They were called \\"Party Badges\\" because only party officials would wear them, but ordinary North Koreans could also illegally buy them in hopes of a higher social status. These badges were made a mandatory part of the attire of every North Korean from Kim's 60th birthday on 15 April 1972 onward, when they came in three classes: for party members, one for adults, and one for students. Most would start wearing one from there on, and by 1980 virtually everyone wore the badges. The Kim Il-sung badge was redesigned after the his death to feature a smiling portrait. Since the North Korean famine in the 1990s, the government has lessened its control on making sure that badge regulations are complied with. Many people ceased wearing the badges in public, and in 2004 the government reportedly responded by allowing this practice. For a time, at least, only party members were required to wear one, though most others would continue to do so regardless. Badges bearing the portrait of Kim Jong-il appeared in 1982, and many started to wear one alongside their Kim Il-sung badges. The first badge containing both Kim Il- sung and Kim Jong-il appeared in the 1980s, but is different from the present double badge reserved for security services cadres. Kim Jong-il badges were discontinued in the 1990s following his alleged remark: \\"How can I be presented on the same level as our sole 'sun', Kim Il Sung?\\". In 1992, in time for Kim Jong-il's 50th birthday, a pin with his face only reappeared. It, too, was unpopular due to his known reluctance to be elevated to the level of his father. Kim Jong-il badges began to be worn more widely only around the year 2000, with a renewed design, and badges featuring both Kims only recently. The round designs were the oldest types. The very first round design in 1953 featured Kim Il-sung's side profile in military uniform, much like their Chinese counterparts. Kim's face from the front began to be used in the 1980s. Rectangular badges appeared in the 1980s and were at first reserved for those working in state security organizations. The flag-shaped badges began to be made in the early 1980s. They featured a symbol related to a party, state, or youth organization. The one bearing the emblem of the Workers' Party became the most popular. After the death of Kim Jong-il in December 2011, party officials started to wear the Kim Jong-il badge next to the Kim Il-sung one. Then, in April 2012, the double badge was reintroduced in its current form. Badges with both leaders have been recently used by people traveling between regions as an item for bartering in the North Korean gray market. Previously, methamphetamine was used for bartering before various crackdowns made the practice hard. Badges eventually replaced drugs despite falling prices. In Pyongyang, too, where money and prized items are in short supply, the badges have value. This makes them a target for pickpockets. Criminals, who are often wealthier than ordinary North Koreans, usually choose to wear the expensive types of badges as status symbols. Wearing Foreigners being awarded Kim Il-sung badges at the Yanggakdo International Hotel Virtually all North Koreans wear the badges. North Koreans start to wear the badges when they turn 12 years old. It is placed above their Korean Children's Union badges. Citizens above the age of 16 are required to wear the badges whenever they leave home. Respect for the badges is enshrined in the Ten Principles for the Establishment of a Monolithic Ideological System, which mandate that they \\"must be treated with reverence and protected with utmost care\\". If someone is caught outside their home without a badge, they are faced with explaining themselves at the next mutual criticism session. The badges are given to eligible North Koreans for free, and are acquired through one's workplace or school. Losing, or selling, a badge results in one having to prove that they have lost the badge without a malicious intent before they are given a new one. Lacking a badge has also been associated with transgression because sometimes people who professed \\"anti-Kim\\" behavior had their badges confiscated. A North Korean may own several different badges that they have attained at different stages of their life, two or three on average, but some have many more. The badges are usually not sold to tourists, but can be conferred upon them for loyalty. Recently, badges have been smuggled out of the country for sale and can be found in Chinese cities in particular, although selling them is illegal in China as well. Both authentic and counterfeit badges are sold in Tumen. Most badges found outside of the country are counterfeits, such as those regularly on sale in Dandong. As of late, badges have been known to be for sale to foreigners in North Korea as well. In the future, the badges are anticipated to become veritable collector's items. The badges are worn on inner garments only, either on the lapel or a shirt, but not on outwear coats. Usually, the badges are worn on the left side of a garment, over the heart. There are atypical ways of wearing the badges that are considered fashionable by North Koreans, the youth in particular. Schoolchildren and teenagers use the badges to \\"perk up\\" their uniforms. One such way is to wear the badge at the very edge of one's garment, for which children of upper-class families in Pyongyang in particular are known. Although it is mandatory to wear a badge, North Korean officials sometimes claim that it is done out of pure loyalty. Most North Koreans simply prefer to wear them because it is much safer to do so. The badges are taken off on certain rare occasions, such as when entering a place of worship. North Koreans traveling abroad also almost always wear the badges, for which they are sometimes ridiculed by foreigners. Types A badge featuring both Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il is the most prestigious type. The badges are designed and made by the Mansudae Art Studio. The badges come in different shapes and sizes. Unlike in China, where Chairman Mao badges were diverse because their production was not overseen by the government, North Korean badges have relatively little variation. All in all, there are more than 20 different designs. The size, shape, coloring, and type of metal of the design is indicative of the social status and institutional affiliations of the person wearing it. For instance, party youths wear large round badges, whereas common people wear smaller round badges. While most badges only feature a portrait of Kim Il-sung, there are two exceptions. The most prestigious type has both Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il against a red banner. No other design features both leaders. The design is reserved to high-level Workers' Party of Korea officials only. It is so rare that seeing one \\"can send many a minor North Korean bureaucrat into a stupor\\". The other exception is badges with the portrait of Kim Jong-il only. They are worn by security services cadres and are also considerably rare. Some feature the leader in a Western suit, the others in military attire, or some other type of clothing. Before Kim Jong-un had been confirmed as Kim Jong-il's successor and Kim Jong-chul was groomed as the country's next leader, a limited set of Kim Jong-chul badges were reportedly made and given to cabinet, party, and army officials. There are no Kim Jong-un badges, but experts think that it is a matter of time before there will be.

He is currently a professor at Yale University and holds the positions of Charles J. MacCurdy Professor in the Anthropology Department, Chair of the Council on Archaeological Studies, and Curator in the Division of Anthropology at the Peabody Museum of Natural History. He has carried out archaeological excavations in the Peruvian Andes since 1975, publishing several books and many articles on Chavin culture, a pre-Hispanic civilization that developed in the northern Andean highlands of Peru from 1000 BC to 400 BC. Burger is married to Lucy Salazar, a Peruvian archaeologist and long time collaborator on many researach projects. His former doctoral student Sabine Hyland has become well-known as an Andean anthropologist.  Education  Burger received his education in the public schools of Great Neck, New York. He went on to get his bachelor's degree in archaeology at Yale College (1972) where he studied under Thomas Patterson and Michael Coe. He received a doctorate in anthropology from the University of California, Berkeley (1978) where he studied under John Howland Rowe and Dorothy Menzel.  Career  Burger began teaching as a faculty member at Yale University in 1981. During his tenure at Yale, he has been Chair of the Anthropology Department (1990-1994), Director of the Peabody Museum of Natural History (1995-2002). He has also taught in Peru at the National University of San Marcos and Pontifical Catholic University of Peru. Burger is also an honorary member of the faculties of the University of Cusco and the University of Iquitos. He is co-curator in the Museo Machu Picchu, Casa Concha in Cusco, Peru, and has been president of the Institute of Andean Research in New York since 2006. Burger's archaeological fieldwork has focused on the northern highlands and central coast of the Peruvian Andes. His research focuses on the emergence and development of early civilizations in the Central Andes and he has illuminated the ways that religious institutions rather than stratified states are involved in the rise of complex societies in the case of the Andes. Burger has carried out field projects in the highlands of the Department of Ancash at the sites of Chav√≠n de Huantar (1975-1976), Huaricoto (1978-1980), as well as in the Lur√≠n Valley just south of Lima at the sites of Cardal (1984-1987, 2007-2008, 2017‚Äì2019), Mina Perdida (1990-1991, 1993-1994), and Manchay Bajo (1998-1999). Burger helped to pioneer the sourcing of cinnabar in the Andes with geochemist Colin Cooke and did important research on Andean diet using carbon isotopes from Machu Picchu, Chavin de Huantarl and Cardal. Burger located the seven major obsidian sources used in ancient Peru and used this analysis to describe the changing patterns of trade in volcanic glass in the pre-Hispanic Andes. This work on obsidian sourcing was based on a series of archaeological surveys that Burger conducted in the south-central highlands of Department of Huancavelica (1999-2000) and Department of Ayacucho (2003-2006). With Lucy Salazar, Burger co-curated a block-buster traveling exhibit on MachuPicchu that traveled for two years to seven cities in the United States from 2003-2005.

The company published books on personal development, guides to the countercultural lifestyle, and consciousness expansion. A number of the company's books were on the psychedelic experience and related subjects. And/Or Press was also one of the first book publishers to embrace underground comix, publishing collections by Bill Griffith, Dave Sheridan, and Fred Schrier. The company went out of business in 1983 after a hostile takeover; co-founder Joseph Sebastian Orfali and his partner Beverly Potter immediately founded Ronin Publishing, which picked up the mantle And/Or Press had established. In 2009, the And/Or Press name was revived in Vancouver, Canada.  Overview  A number of And/Or Press books on recreational drugs were high-volume sellers in the 1970s, including Mel Frank and Ed Rosenthal's The Indoor Highest Quality Marijuana Grower's Guide, D. Gold's Cannabis Alchemy, Adam Gottlieb's Legal Highs, and Peter Stafford's Psychedelics Encyclopedia. Edward Bauman, et al.'s The Holistic Health Handbook was a national bestseller. (And/Or Press published a number of books affiliated with the Berkeley Holistic Health Center.) The company republished Pitigrilli's 1933 book Cocaine, as well as original works by Ernest Callenbach, Paul Krassner, Dennis McKenna, Jacques Vall√©e, and Robert Anton Wilson.  History  And/Or Press was founded as a cooperative in San Francisco by brothers Sebastian and John Orfali, Carlene Schnabel, and Charly Jenkewitz.Walters, Ray. \\"Paperbacks: New and Noteworthy,\\" New York Times (November 16, 1980). (In 1973, Sebastian Orfali had owned People's Comix, a comic book retailer in San Francisco's North Beach). Among the first books the company published were Griffith and Kinney's Young Lust Reader, Pitigrilli's Cocaine, and W. Golden Mortimer's History of Coca. Most of their catalog was sold through head shops and other non-traditional venues. By 1976 the company had moved to Berkeley, California. By this time, the company was also acting as a distributor of other publishers' books on affiliated topics. And/Or Press incorporated in 1978.\\"And/Or Press Incorporated,\\" CA-registry.com. Accessed Jan. 18, 2017. By 1980 the company had six employees and did about $1 million in business per year, mostly in traditional bookstores. In 1982, And/Or Press joined with three other Bay Area presses to form Network, Inc., a publishing cooperative designed to help small presses compete with larger publishing houses. Orfali became Network, Inc.'s chairman.Appelbaum, Judith. \\"PAPERBACK TALK: What Co-ops Can Do,\\" New York Times (December 19, 1982). After the 1983 takeover of And/Or Press, Orfali and his long-time partner Beverly Potter, PhD, formed Ronin Publishing under a similar mission as its predecessor.

It was first described by Eva Andermann et al. in 1972.  Symptoms  Symptoms begin in infancy and include: * hypotonia * areflexia * amyotrophy * variable degrees of dysgenesis of the corpus callosum * mild to severe intellectual and developmental delay * psychiatric problems including paranoid delusions, depression, hallucinations and autistic-like behavior  Genetics  The inheritance pattern is autosomal recessive. Several genes have been associated with the disorder, including SLC12A6. Neuropathology Autopsy examination of 8 cases has shown both developmental and degenerative neuropathologic features in this disease, consistent with clinical duality as both a neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorder. In the central nervous system, accompanying the hypotonia at birth is hypoplasia of the corticospinal tracts. Another developmental feature is seen in the corpus callosum, which varies from absent to hypoplastic. The anterior commissure is almost always absent, but occasionally hypoplastic. A bundle of Probst can be found running antero-posterior rather than crossing the midline. The axonal damage due to the channel deficiency can cause a reactive axonal overgrowth leading to small tumor-like growths, or tumorlets, called axonomas, or balls of aberrant axons. Damaged axons can also show a sign of inhibition of axonal transport, forming axonal spheroids. These spheroids can be throughout the cerebral hemispheres, explaining the psychotic symptoms by disconnection of the brain from itself by axonal functional disruption. In the Peripheral nervous system, the disease is more severe. While most nervous system diseases affect either CNS or PNS, this disease affects both, but it is the changes in the peripheral nervous system that lead to death. This occurs by axonal disease paralyzing the skeletal muscles, including the respiratory muscles as a result of axonal damage in peripheral nerves. Changes in the axons are more severe in the PNS than CNS and under the electron microscope, some axons look necrotic, by virtue of containing mitochondrial flocculent densities and other irreversible changes. The lack of innervation of the body musculature during development gives rise to small body weights, often below 40 kilograms, remarkable in view of the preserved brain weights. Diagnosis Typical diagnostic workup includes * clinical features * electrophysiologic testing * molecular genetic testing (SLC12A6) * magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain (revealing in 60% of the patients callosal agenesis and in 10% partial callosal agenesis)  Treatment  There is currently no cure, but some symptoms may be treated such as neuroleptics for the psychiatric problems.  Prognosis  The prognosis is poor. Patients are usually wheelchair bound by their 20s and die by their 30s.  Prevalence  The prevalence rate has been estimated to be less than 1/1,000,000 worldwide. However, it is much more common in the French-Canadian population of the Saguenay and Lac-St-Jean regions of Quebec, Canada, where it has a frequency of about 1 in 2100 in live births, and a carrier rate of 1 in 23.

Several genera of probiotic bacteria are known to produce proteobiotics, including Lactococcus spp., Pediococcus spp. Lactobacillus spp. and Bifidobacterium spp.  Mode of action  Recent studies have explored mode of action of proteobiotics and their potential benefits in maintaining the ratio of beneficial bacteria, lowering bacterial imbalance and improving gut function, however, any of the statements based on research have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration, USA. Unlike other molecules produced by probiotic bacteria, such as organic acids and bacteriocins, proteobiotics are natural metabolites which interfere with quorum sensing, the cell-to-cell communications which occur between bacterial cells, mainly by interfering with the LuxS quorum sensing system. These quorum-sensing systems allow bacteria to respond to changes in their environment and play a role in the ability of pathogens to evade host defence mechanisms. By interfering with quorum sensing, proteobiotics inhibit the cascade of events leading to adhesion to, and invasion of, host cells. This is achieved through reduced expression of specific virulence genes (typically found on pathogenicity islands) that facilitate the infection process. Specifically, proteobiotics inhibit virulence genes involved in toxin production, biofilm formation, cell adhesionTroll, Marie-Luise. ‚ÄúInvestigating the Anti-Virulent Activity of Probiotic Bioactives on Clostridium Perfringens.‚Äù M.Sc.

Principal areas of research As described in further detail in the sections that follow, Bartlett's research and publications can be divided into two main groups: studies in philosophy and studies in clinical psychology. In philosophy, his research has focused on the theory of reflexivity, self- referential argumentation, and the metatheory of reference and identification. In clinical psychology, his research has focused on human pathology as it is expressed in genocide, the Holocaust, war, terrorism, obedience, hatred, human ecological destruction, and human conceptual pathology. In addition, Bartlett's research in clinical psychology has sought to develop our understanding of what he calls human moral intelligence, as well as of the psychology of peer review and editorial bias, the phenomenology of hatred, the psychology of mediocrity, and the psychology of stupidity. He has challenged the conventional understanding and treatment of mental disorders as promoted by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Bartlett's publishing record and biographical information show that his work developed during the following approximate periods: * 1964-1974, studies in phenomenology * 1975-1988, studies relating to the metalogic of reference * 1989-2011, studies relating to clinical psychology * 2012- , further work relating to the metalogic of reference Research and publications in philosophy =Phenomenology and the elimination of conceptual error= Beginning with Bartlett's doctoral dissertation, whose doctoral jury members were French philosopher Paul Ricoeur (dissertation director), Belgian mathematical logician Jean Ladri√®re, and Belgian philosopher Alphonse de Waehlens, Bartlett developed an approach to the study of philosophical problems by means of a therapy for concepts. The approach took the form of a self-validating phenomenological epistemology whose purpose is the identification and correction of many conceptually self-undermining errors that Bartlett classified as conceptual pathologies. He applied the resulting methodology to a number of traditionally understood epistemological problems, as well as to portions of everyday, conventional conceptual vocabulary, to show that many of these must be recognized to be self-referentially inconsistent. He characterized the resulting methodology as self-validating in the sense that it cannot not be accepted without self-referential inconsistency. =Studies of the metalogic of reference and conceptual therapy= Bartlett first formulated his revisionary methodology within a phenomenological framework in which the concept of reference plays a logically primitive role; he later separated his approach to conceptual therapy from phenomenology.

Bartlett applied the resulting methodology to a group of conceptually basic concepts (for example, space, time, causality, consciousness, etc.) that both are relied upon in much ordinary thinking and are used in the formulation of scientific theories. Such applications, Bartlett sought to show, bring to light that many basic concepts, which tend to be routinely employed unquestioningly, are self-referentially inconsistent and stand in need of meaningful substitutes, for which he developed self- referentially consistent replacement concepts.Steven James Bartlett, The Pathology of Man: A Study of Human Evil.

As Bartlett has described, there are many such systems, ranging from reflexive formal systems in mathematics and in mathematical logic, to self-referential systems in artificial intelligence and the theory of computation, to self-referential systems that are physiologically based ‚Äî an advanced example being that of human self-awareness and the capacity to reflect on that awareness. Secondary applications arise in connection with breakdowns in reflexive functioning found in certain psychopathologies. Research and publications in clinical psychology Bartlett's studies relating to clinical psychology have focused on the following areas: =The psychology of human aggression and destructiveness= In 2005, Bartlett's book The Pathology of Man: A Study of Human Evil was published. The 200,000-word study applies the science of pathology to the human species in order to identify and describe many dispositionally-based pathologies that afflict our species, often without our awareness. A central purpose of the book is to bring together and discuss the work of twentieth century psychologists, psychiatrists, ethologists, psychologically-focused historians, and others who have studied the underlying psychology of human aggression and destructiveness. The conclusions of the study emphasize that human pathology has many originating factors, that people obtain varied cognitive and emotional gratifications from such pathology, and that human pathology is a normal human condition and is therefore generally intractable, at least at this stage of human development. Bartlett describes how deficits in what he defines as moral intelligence combine with the psychology of stupidity, which together form major contributors to the psychological shortcomings that result in human pathology.Bartlett first directed attention to what he calls human \\"moral intelligence\\" in his 2002 work, \\"Roots of Human Resistance to Animal Rights: Psychological and Conceptual Blocks.\\" Animal Law, Vol. 8, 2002, pp. 143-76. He then studied the nature of moral intelligence in detail in his 2005 book, The Pathology of Man: A Study of Human Evil. Springfield, IL: Charles C. Thomas, 2005, Chapter 18; also pp. 5, 8, 64, 101, 174, 184, 218, 293, 304, 310-312. In Bartlett's study, deficits in moral intelligence constitute one of the central factors that contribute to human pathology In critical responses to the book, the study was commended by The Journal of Analytical Psychology: \\"Bartlett is a lucid, painstaking and illuminating writer. This is certainly a classic work of reference in the field.\\"Marcus West, \\"Steven James Bartlett: The Pathology of Man: A Study of Human Evil ‚Äì Book Review.\\" The Journal of Analytical Psychology, Volume 51, No. 3, June, 2006, pp. 486-487. The Bulletin of the Menninger Clinic appraised the book as \\"a challenging and thought provoking approach that makes a significant contribution to an aspect of human psychopathology that is rarely or so comprehensively addressed.\\"W. W. Meissner, M.D., \\"The Pathology of Man: A Study of Human Evil by Steven James Bartlett: Book Review.\\" The Bulletin of the Menninger Clinic, Vol. 71, No. 3, 2007, pp. 267-268. About the book, M. Scott Peck commented: \\"[T]he study of evil is just beginning and you are a pioneer.\\" Eric Zillmer, Carl R. Pacifico Professor of Neuropsychology at Drexel University, commended the book: \\"Steven James Bartlett's The Pathology of Man marks the most comprehensive examination of evil to date. Drawing from different fields of study, including psychology and epistemology, Bartlett sets out on a Tour de Force of delineating the parameters on human evil.... The resulting text is a most welcome addition to the field and provides for fascinating reading. The Pathology of Man is a timely, scholarly, and important piece of work that should appeal to anyone who is interested in understanding human evil.\\"\\"Preface\\" to Steven James Bartlett, The Pathology of Man: A Study of Human Evil. Springfield, IL: Charles C. Thomas, 2005, pp. vii-viii. Author and President of the Jewish Life Network Irving Greenberg commented: \\"This book is stunning, upsetting, gripping.... [T]he book is a moral act of the highest order. These...comments would be incomplete without mentioning the erudition, the intellectual insight and playfulness, the gallows humor and the self-restraint which deepen and lighten this book.\\" Since the publication of The Pathology of Man, Bartlett has published a series of further books and papers related to the same and related subjects.Steven James Bartlett, Normality Does Not Equal Mental Health: The Need to Look Elsewhere for Standards of Good Psychological Health. Santa Barbara, CA: Praeger Publishers, 2011.Steven James Bartlett, \\"The Ecological Pathology of Man.\\" Mentalities/Mentalit√©s: An Interdisciplinary Journal, Vol. 20, No. 2, 2006, pp. 1-18.Steven James Bartlett, \\"From the Artist's Perspective: The Psychopathology of the Normal World.\\" The Humanistic Psychologist, Vol. 37, No. 3, 2009, pp. 235-256.Steven James Bartlett, \\"The Dilemma of Abnormality.\\" In Thomas G. Plante (Ed.), Abnormal Psychology across the Ages. Santa Barbara, CA: Praeger, 2013, Vol. 3, Chapter 1, pp. 1-20. =Challenging the standard of psychological normality presupposed by contemporary psychiatry and much clinical psychology= In 2011, Bartlett's book Normality Does Not Equal Mental Health: The Need to Look Elsewhere for Standards of Good Psychological Health was published. The book examines contemporary psychiatry's and clinical psychology's definition of mental health in terms of the baseline standard of psychological normality. Bartlett makes the case that this supposition has come to be accepted uncritically ‚Äî even though that supposition is fundamental to current clinical theory and practice, and forms the core of the psychiatric classification system of the DSM (the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders), which has become today's diagnostic authority. Normality Does Not Equal Mental Health questions and rejects this central assumption. Among the author's objections to this assumption is the reification by the DSM of syndromes (i.e., equating mere syndromes with real disease entities) despite the absence of an organic basis for the majority of alleged medical disorders. Bartlett seeks to offer a constructive revision of what we should accept as a standard for good mental health. A critical assessment by PsychCRITIQUES combined a review of both The Pathology of Man and Normality Does Not Equal Mental Health, evaluating the two books as follows: \\"Pathology and Normality contain many altogether usefully reframed concepts. [T]he semiotic analysis of nosologies offered in Chapter 2 of Normality [is] a most promising organizing conceptual framework, helpful in understanding the problems with DSM classifications. It could not be more relevant in our times.... I wish everyone would read Bartlett's chapter in Normality on the abuses of peer review and editorial bias (Chapter 7) and adopt his proposed code of conduct for peer reviewers and editors (p. 172). And Bartlett's treatment of relativism, the relativity of frameworks, and human evil in Pathology is absolutely limpid (Chapter 20). These and many other gems are scattered throughout the books. For this reason, and because the books present such an unusual stance that can provoke thoughtful consideration of the accepted truths in psychology, I highly recommend them.... Both books are well written and clearly structured. Bartlett follows a regular expository pattern by explaining objectives, logically and systematically developing arguments and conclusions, and presenting frequent summaries. The premises and implications are intellectually easy to grasp, unforgettable, and alarming.... Bartlett includes considerations and concepts that are seldom presented elsewhere.\\"Alejandra Suarez, \\"The Worst Devils of Our Nature: A Review of Normality Does Not Equal Mental Health: The Need to Look Elsewhere for Standards of Good Psychological Health and The Pathology of Man: A Study of Human Evil.\\" PsychCRITIQUES, June 13, 2012, Vol. 57, Release 23, Article 2 (no pagination specified). =Psychotherapy and its effectiveness= Over a period of decades, Bartlett has weighed the question whether psychotherapy is truly effective. In 1987, his book When You Don't Know Where to Turn: A Self-Diagnosing Guide to Counseling and Therapy was published and subsequently adopted by the Psychology Today Book Club and the Psychotherapy Book Club.Steven James Bartlett, When You Don't Know Where to Turn: A Self-Diagnosing Guide to Counseling and Therapy. New York: Contemporary Books/McGraw-Hill, 1987. Now freely available with a 2014 Preface as an eBook through Project Gutenberg; separate online description of the book and its purpose. The book presents a self-diagnosing algorithm to help readers identify, based on effectiveness studies, potentially most promising forms of therapeutic care. The algorithm takes into account individual symptoms, circumstances, personality, and life goals. The book was followed by the publication of the author's summary appraisal of the effectiveness of psychotherapy,Steven James Bartlett, \\"The Problem of Psychotherapeutic Effectiveness.\\" Methodology and Science, Vol. 23, No. 2, 1990, pp. 75-86. about which psychiatrist Thomas Szasz, a long-time critic of psychiatry, commented: \\"It is one of the best, if not the best, that I have read on this subject.\\" Similarly, psychologist Hans H. Strupp, who has extensively studied the effectiveness of psychotherapy, commented: \\"I find myself in substantial agreement with [Bartlett's] major points which are well stated.\\"Hans H. Strupp, quotation from letter to the author dated November 14, 1990, published online and in the open access paper, Steven James Bartlett, \\"The Problem of Psychotherapeutic Effectiveness,\\" updated 2014.A further discussion of these issues is found in Bartlett's book, Normality Does Not Equal Mental Health: The Need to Look Elsewhere for Standards of Good Psychological Health, Chap. 9, pp. 237-240. Santa Barbara, CA: Praeger Publishers, 2011. =The psychology of higher education and burn-out among liberal arts faculty= Bartlett studied these issues in a series of published papers that seek to explain faculty demoralization that can result from deteriorating conditions affecting the state of higher education in America.Steven James Bartlett, \\"Acedia: The Etiology of Work-Engendered Depression.\\" New Ideas in Psychology, Vol. 8, No. 3, 1990, pp. 389-396.Steven James Bartlett, \\"Barbarians at the Door: A Psychological and Historical Profile of Today's College Students.\\" Methodology and Science, Vol. 26, No. 1, 1993, pp. 18-40.

(In a \\"Note to Our Readers,\\" Vol. 36, No. 3, page 303, the journal notified readers of this version of the paper that Modern Age expressed regret for \\"numerous and substantive changes and abridgments...to which the author had not consented,\\" and offered to send readers upon request a reprint of the text as originally written.)Steven James Bartlett, \\"The Loss of Permanent Realities: Demoralization of University Faculty in the Liberal Arts.\\" Methodology and Science, Vol. 27, No. 1, 1994, pp. 25-39.Steven James Bartlett, \\"The Psychology of Faculty Demoralization in the Liberal Arts: Burnout, Acedia, and the Disintegration of Idealism.\\" New Ideas in Psychology, Vol. 12, No. 3, 1994, pp. 277-289. =The psychology of animal rights= Bartlett published a psychological and epistemological analysis of the blocks that prevent the majority of people from recognizing and respecting the sentience of members of other species. The study, \\"Roots of Human Resistance to Animal Rights: Psychological and Conceptual Blocks,\\" was developed within a legal framework in order to make evident the ways in which human laws have reflected the underlying psychological and conceptual blocks to compassionate treatment of non-human animals.Steven James Bartlett, \\"Roots of Human Resistance to Animal Rights: Psychological and Conceptual Blocks.\\" Animal Law, Vol. 8, 2002, pp. 143-76. Electronically re-published October, 2002, by the Michigan State University's Detroit College of Law, Animal Law Web Center. Bartlett was later invited by Brazil's Ministry of Education to address the International Congress on Animal Rights, Salvador, Brazil, Oct. 8-11, 2008. For use at the Congress, \\"Roots of Human Resistance to Animal Rights\\" was translated into Portuguese and then published.Steven James Bartlett, \\"Ra√≠zes da resist√™ncia humana aos direitos dos animais: Bloqueios psicol√≥gicos e conceituais.\\" Daniel Braga Louren√ßo (Trans.). Brazilian Animal Rights Review (Revista Brasileira de Direito Animal), Vol. 2, No. 3, July/December, 2007, pp. 17-66. =The psychology of creativity= Bartlett's studies relating to the nosology of mental illness and his critique of the assumption that psychological normality should be equated with good mental health led him to examine the psychology of creative individuals. The psychology of artists and other highly creative people has been studied from the diagnostic perspective of DSM's psychiatric classification of mental disorders, with the result that some outstanding creative individuals may be considered to have various degrees of psychopathology. Bartlett has argued that this is not only short- sighted, but it questionably presumes that the psychology of normality should serve as arbiter for mentally healthy emotional, aesthetic, and cognitive characteristics and abilities. In a group of further publications, Bartlett has described in detail how it is possible to enrich and deepen our understanding of both the psychology of creativity and the psychology of normality.Steven James Bartlett, \\"When Normal Is Harmful, and Abnormal Is Healthy.\\" In the electronic research database, Health and Wellness. Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-Clio Press, 2013. =Psychological studies of philosophy= With training and research in psychology and philosophy, Bartlett has undertaken a psychological examination both of philosophy as a discipline and of philosophers as a psychologically characterizable group.Steven James Bartlett, \\"Narcissism and Philosophy.\\" Methodology and Science, Vol. 19, No. 1, 1986, pp. 16-26.Steven James Bartlett, \\"Philosophy as Ideology.\\" Metaphilosophy, Vol. 17, No. 1, 1986, pp. 1-13.Steven James Bartlett, \\"Psychological Underpinnings of Philosophy.\\" Metaphilosophy, Vol. 20, Nos. 3 & 4, 1989, pp. 295-305.Steven James Bartlett, \\"Epistemological Intelligence.\\" Monograph, open access publication, 2017, PhilPapers and HAL (Centre pour la Communication Scientifique Directe). Related to this work, Bartlett has sought to identify and describe \\"epistemological intelligence\\" as a distinguishable variety of human intelligence, one which he explains is especially important to philosophers. In this context, he has sought to understand the challenges posed by the psychological profile of philosophers that can obstruct the development and implementation of the skills associated with epistemological intelligence.

Bartlett argues that this \\"metalogical\\" variety of self-referential inconsistency comprises a new and distinct kind of self-referential inconsistency, to be distinguished from the philosophically familiar varieties of semantical and pragmatical self-referential inconsistency. * \\"The Role of Reflexivity in Understanding Human Understanding\\". \\"Introduction\\" from Steven James Bartlett (Ed.), Reflexivity: A Source-Book in Self-Reference, pp. 3‚Äì18. * The Species Problem: Inescapable Ambiguity and Redundancy.

In Bartlett's monograph, the \\"species problem\\" refers to past efforts, foremost by biologists, to define definitively and objectively what the concept of \\"species\\" means. Bartlett seeks to demonstrate two central assertions about the species problem: First, he claims that past efforts to define in any compelling way what \\"species\\" means have been unsuccessful because they have failed to understand the theoretical impossibility of the task. It is theoretically impossible, he argues, to define in any compelling way what \\"species\\" means due to what he calls \\"the inescapable ambiguity\\" that is ingredient in the very attempt to reach such a definition. Second, he claims that the solution to the species problem requires what he calls a \\"framework-relative\\" approach to species definition. Such an approach, Bartlett seeks to demonstrate, is logically compelling in the sense that it cannot not be accepted without inconsistency. * \\"The Case for Government by Artificial Intelligence\\". A critical and speculative essay, briefly reviewing Bartlett's previous book-length studies relating to shortcomings of psychological normality, and discussing their possible remediation through government by artificial intelligence. * \\"Paratheism: A Proof That God Neither Exists nor Does Not Exist\\". Bartlett argues that theism, atheism, and agnosticism are all fundamentally incoherent from the standpoint of a logical, epistemological analysis. He formulates a proof that theism, as well as atheism and agnosticism, are equally unacceptable because each is \\"conceptually self-undermining\\" and therefore incoherent. * Epistemological Intelligence. Open access monograph available from HAL (Centre pour la Communication Scientifique Directe) and PhilPapers. In this monograph, Bartlett develops the concept of \\"epistemological intelligence,\\" which he introduces as a new distinguishable variety of human intelligence. He reports his observations of the psychology of philosophers, and claims that the commonly prevailing psychological profile of philosophers often stands in the way of their ability to develop the skills that define epistemological intelligence. * \\"Mismeasuring Our Lives: The Case against Usefulness, Popularity, and the Desire to Influence Others\\". In this paper, Bartlett examines what he claims are three important and unquestioned presumptions that fundamentally influence contemporary society, our educational system, and the professions. These presumptions are: the high value that is placed on usefulness, on striving for popularity, and on the wish to influence other people. He presents the case against these presumptions which he claims impede the development of human culture. * \\"The Objectivity of Truth, Morality, and Beauty\\". In this essay, Bartlett advances an innovative approach to answer the perennial question whether truth, morality, and beauty have an objective basis. The essay seeks to show how it is possible to associate three varieties of human intelligence‚Äîcognitive intelligence, \\"moral intelligence,\\" and \\"aesthetic intelligence\\"‚Äîwith justifiable objective judgments about truth, morality, and beauty. * \\"America's Upside-down Doctrine of Education: Albert Jay Nock's Theory of What Has Gone Wrong ‚Äî Or Is It Right?\\". In this paper, Bartlett examines a set of fundamental assumptions about American education that were analyzed and criticized almost a hundred years ago by Albert Jay Nock, an author and theorist of education. Nock's theory of American education points to a need to question these assumptions and, if possible, to support them with evidence.

The first Women's Guards units formed in early February in the main Finnish cities. More than 15 female Guards units were established by the end of March 1918, with a total of about 2,000 women serving. The female Guards units consisted of young industrial workers, maids, and servants. Their average age was about 20, but some were as young as 14. The women served in auxiliary units and in combat. By joining the Red Guards, women stepped out of their traditional role in Finnish society and were demonized by the Whites, the anti-Communist paramilitary. The Red commanders were reluctant to commit the female Guards units to battle and usually hold them in reserve. Towards the end of the war, several saw combat. During the Battle of Tampere, the city hall was the last pocket of Red resistance; there is a legend that this was because while the male defenders wanted to capitulate the Tampere Women's Red Guard insisted on fighting to the end. The fiercely fought Finnish Civil War lasted 15 weeks. Both sides frequently shot prisoners out of hand and both sides executed civilians in campaigns of terror. Over 10,000 Reds were murdered in the subsequent White terror. Captured women who were considered to be armed fighters would usually be shot and were sometimes raped before their execution.  History   Background  Initial front lines and offensives of the Civil War at the beginning of February 1918. Areas controlled by the Finnish government (\\"Whites\\") in blue, and by the Finnish rebels (\\"Reds\\") in red Finnish working-class women took a more active role in society beginning in the late 1800s, most notably in the suffrage movement which began during the 1890s. Women organised conscription strikes as part of the movement against the Russification of Finland from the early 1900s, and female labourers played a major role in the 1905 general strike. Although Finnish women gained the right to vote in 1906 (second in the world), women's social status lagged behind that of men; a married woman was under her husband's authority and could not have a job without his permission. The condition of working-class women was much worse than that of middle-class women, and the situation for maids and servants was especially poor. Under the 1865 Imperial Servant Act they lived in slave-like conditions, often experiencing sexual abuse. Child labour was legal in Finland until the 1920s. The Finnish Civil War was a conflict from 27 January to 15 May 1918 for the leadership and control of Finland during the country's transition from a Grand Duchy of the Russian Empire to an independent state. The clashes took place in the context of the national, political, and social turmoil caused by World War I. The civil war was fought between the Reds, led by a section of the Social Democratic Party, and the Whites, controlled by the conservative-based Senate. The paramilitary Red Guards, were largely made up of industrial and agrarian workers and controlled the cities and industrial centres of southern Finland. The paramilitary White Guards consisted of farmers, along with middle-class and upper-class social strata, and controlled rural central and northern Finland.  Formation  The Pyht√§√§ Women's Guard, which fought the Germans in the Kyminlinna Fort The first Women's Guards units, formed in early February in Helsinki, Vyborg and Valkeakoski, were modelled on the Women's Battalions of the 1917 Russian Revolution. At first, the Red government, the Red Guard staff and the anti-militarist Social Democratic Women's Union opposed the formation of the women's units. On 13 March, the Red government recognized existing units but ended the formation of new units. Its order was not strictly observed, however, and some new units were still formed in late March and early April in the largest industrial portions of Red-controlled Finland; with few exceptions, they were not formed in rural areas. Some women served in combat units, and others were assigned to support duties. The armed women received brief military training from Red Guard leaders. At first, they did guard duty, but in late March they began to be sent to the front. The Women's Guard from Vihti, one of the few formed in the countryside, was composed of local maids. The core of the Women's Guards were radical women who wanted to create a more egalitarian society and improve the status of women. The women cut their hair short and wore unconventional clothing, often rejecting skirts and dresses in favour of trousers (worn only by men at the time). Their rejection of traditional values earned the enmity of the Finnish Whites because the working women did not fit the roles of conservative, middle-class society. Although many women testified in court after the war that they joined the Red Guards for the money (a higher-than-usual salary), their testimony was considered self-serving since they faced sentencing. The total number of women who served in the Red Guards is unclear; incomplete Red Guards payroll records list 1,440 Women's Guard members. According to historian Ohto Manninen, the total was 2,000. According to an upcoming 2017 book by historian Tuomas Hoppu, there were at least 2,600 members‚Äîtwo to three percent of the 90,000‚Äì100,000 Red Guard fighters. Thousands of other women also supported the Red Guards. The Political Offence Court accused more than 5,500 women of being Reds after the war ended in May 1918, a fraction of the total. Although 4,000 of the accused were convicted of treason, all except some of the leadership were pardoned in October 1918.  Public attitudes  By joining the Red Guards, women stepped out of their traditional role in Finnish society. They were perceived as a threat by the conservative Finnish Whites, who considered them immoral, unfeminine women unfit for the roles of wife and mother. During the war, unsubstantiated rumours were spread about Red Guard women; according to White newspapers, the Reds tortured all their prisoners and castrated some. Only one woman is known to have participated in White executions, despite the fact that over 1,600 people were killed in the Red terror. Red nurses working in field hospitals were mocked as \\"sisters of love\\", implying that they were prostitutes. Animosity toward Red women was so harsh that they were often dehumanized and demonized. A well-known outburst was made by Finnish author Ilmari Kianto, who called Red women \\"wolf bitches\\" who should be exterminated. According to a Hufvudstadsbladet article, Red women should not be treated as prisoners of war but should be \\"chased into the woods like animals\\". Another newspaper, Aamulehti, called them the \\"lowest scum\\" who must be cleansed from Finnish society. Archbishop Gustaf Johansson said that Red women must be left \\"in the hands of Satan\\" and not helped in any way. The bodies of women killed in battle were often desecrated by being stripped or partially undressed. After the war, Red women were rejected by society and their role in the war was belittled for decades. Nearly all academic research on the women dates only to the 1990s.  Combat  Captured Red women in Lahti. Most were executed soon after this photograph was taken. Women's Guards were the last reserve in the war's final stages. In April, they took part in the defensive battles of Tampere, Helsinki and Vyborg and the Battle of Antrea in the Karelian Isthmus. Women who joined the Red refugees fleeing east also fought German troops in southern Tavastia as thousands of refugees tried to break through the German lines. In the Battle of Syrj√§ntaka in Tuulos on 28 April, over 4,000 refugees clashed against the German lines with the Valkeakoski Women's Guard in front. In only a few hours, more than 300 Red Guard fighters and dozens of German soldiers died in battle at a highway crossroads. The Germans retreated when they ran out of ammunition. The women had already cleared the way for the refugees the previous day in the village of Alvettula, crossing a bridge held by White troops. A few days after the Battle of Syrj√§ntaka, 20,000‚Äì30,000 Reds were captured near the town of Lahti.  Executions  Executed members of the female Red Guards in Hennala prison camp, early May 1918 Executed Red Guards in the Hatanp√§√§ district of Tampere. A woman with her breasts exposed is in the front of the picture. About 420 to 460 members of the Women's Guards were executed during the final stages of the war. The largest mass executions took place in Lahti, where 20,000‚Äì30,000 fleeing Reds were captured by German and White troops at the end of April. Up to 2,200 Red women were placed in the Hennala camp, where a battalion commanded by the Estonian colonel Hans Kalm shot at least 218 women in early May. The number may be considerably higher; the Labour Archives of Finland's Terror List includes the names of 600 women, but their fate cannot be verified. The largest single execution in Lahti was carried out on 9 May, when at least 100 Red women were shot. According to the diary of German officer Hans Tr√∂bst, they were shot with a machine gun in the woods near the Hennala Garrison; according to Tr√∂bst, the surrounding trees were spattered with brain tissue. Women wearing men's clothing, such as trousers or a military outfit, were commonly considered armed fighters and summarily shot. Women tried to get rid of their trousers, and sometimes wore nothing but underpants as they were picked from a crowd of captured Reds. Not all those executed belonged to the Women's Guards. Victims included women who had joined the fleeing refugees, some of whom were pregnant or mothers of small children. The youngest girls shot were 14 years old. The women executed in Lahti came from the provinces of H√§me, Turku and Pori and Uusimaa, primarily from Alastaro, Forssa, Hyvink√§√§, H√§meenlinna, Lahti, Loimaa, Maaria, M√§nts√§l√§, Pori and Turku. The Valkeakoski Women's Guard was executed in the village of Hauho on 1 May. Some of the women were raped before they were shot; other women imprisoned in Lahti received food in exchange for sexual favours. The executions were carried out by Finnish Whites. The Germans did not execute Red women and, in many cases, tried to stop the Whites from shooting their prisoners. However, the Germans did participate in sexual abuse of the captured women. According to recent studies the executions were an organized effort to \\"cleanse\\" Finnish society of the Red Guard women. Most of the executed women were industrial workers, whom the Whites considered the lowest social class. The Guard members who had worked as maids or servants and came from rural areas were shot less often. In Lahti the executed men were usually commanders and platoon leaders, but in the case of women ordinary fighters were also shot. The Red women were seen as a threat to Finnish racial purity. Colonel Hans Kalm, leader of the Lahti executions, was interested in the eugenics of Martti Pihkala and Lauri Pihkala (brothers who were among the main inspirations of White Finland). In addition to executing Red women, the Whites carried out ethnic cleansing; more than 400 Russian civilians died in the Vyborg massacre. The extrajudicial killings and the executions of those sentenced by temporary courts-martial were finally halted in late May. Prisoners were then brought to the newly-established Political Offense Court, which commuted the death sentences. Casualties At least 755 Red Guard women died in the war; 70 to 130 were killed on the battlefield, 420 to 460 were executed by the White Guards, 80 to 110 died in prison camps, and 180 were missing.  Largest units  Helsinki The Helsinki Women's Guard was the largest unit, with 466 members. They fought the German Baltic Sea Division in the Battle of Helsinki on 12‚Äì13 April, defending the Linnanm√§ki hill. However, research has indicated that their role has been exaggerated. Tampere Tampere had two Women's Guard units, one in the town and another in the suburb of Pispala. The Tampere Guard had 221 members, and the Pispala Guard (led by the 18-year-old peasant Emma Oksala) 40 to 50. During the final hours of the 5 April Battle of Tampere, the Tampere Guard defended the city hall; the male fighters were willing to surrender, but the women insisted on fighting to the last woman. As the battle was ending, only three women were shot. Women were not executed in Tampere, despite the mass execution of more than 3,000 Reds who had surrendered. The White Guard staff prohibited the execution of women, probably because of the large number of foreigners in the city. Valkeakoski The Uuras Women's Guard in the Tr√•ngsund Fortress The 155-member Valkeakoski Women's Guard was primarily composed of women who worked in the Tervasaari Paper Mill. When the Red refugee column fought the Germans on their way east at the end of April, the Valkeakoski guard took an important bridge in the village of Alvettula (north of H√§meenlinnan) on 25 April. Two days later, they fought German troops in the Battle of Syrj√§ntaka. Some of the women were captured after the battle and handed over to the White Guard. More than 20 women were held in a barn (and possibly raped) for two days before they were shot in the village of Hauho. A total of 47 Valkeakoski women were killed during the war. Vyborg The Vyborg Women's Guard fought in the Battle of Antrea and the Battle of Vyborg. The 151-member unit was led by 20-year-old Toini M√§kel√§. After the war, she fled to Soviet Russia and formed a women's battalion which fought in the Russian Civil War. Another Vyborg women's guard was formed in the port of Uuras by local workers. The Uuras Guard occupied the Tr√•ngsund Fortress. Turku The Turku Women's Guard (also known as the Maaria Women's Guard) was composed of women from the Turku suburb of Raunistula (part of Maaria at the time). The 113-member guard first fought in the Battle of Tampere. After the town collapsed, the Turku women fought on the Satakunta front and in the Battle of Lemp√§√§l√§. Dozens of its members were executed at the Hennala camp in Lahti after they were captured on their way east.

The original building was situated approximately at the corner of Bolshaya Sadovaya street. Over time, it has somewhat shifted towards Bogatyanovsky Lane (now ‚Äï Kirov Avenue).  History  In 1762, after the demolition of St. Anne fortress, located near Cherkassk (nowadays ‚Äï Starocherkasskaya village) on Vasilyevsky hills, it was decided to transport the Holy Protection Church located therein to the newly built St. Dimitry of Rostov fortress. The church was dismantled, all logs were numbered and transported to the chosen place. All of the priests and most of the parishioners were soldiers. The exact location of the first church building ‚Äï the northeast pit of Kirov public garden, was discovered in 2003, during the course of archaeological studies. Over time, there had been grown a need for a bigger church. In 1781 the chief commandant Major General Simon Guryev sent a petition to Archbishop Nikiforov, head of the Slovenian and Kherson diocese, \\"for permission to organize a new and bigger church, to replace the dilapidated one.\\" In 1782, the permission was granted. The old church building was dismantled and almost at the same place a new building (also wooden) was constructed. The consecration of the church took place on September 28, 1784. In 1796, right southern aisle was attached to the Intercession Church. In its construction were used materials of the dismantled Church of St. Dimitry of Rostov. The aisle was also devoted to St. Dimitry. In 1818 in bell tower were installed clocks. Old Church of the Intercession For a considerable period of time Intercession Church served as the principal church not only for the fortress of St. Dimitry of Rostov, but also for people of local settlements. Since the end of the 18th century Church of Intercession had been considered to be a cathedral. The status changed in 1822, when Church of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary on the decree of the Holy Synod was declared cathedral. On November 2, 1895 due to the negligence of the caretaker there was a fire, which has burned down the bell tower and damaged the building of the church itself. On August 10, 1897 a new stone building was constructed on the project of architect Nikolay Sokolov. The new building was located just west of the old one ‚Äï closer to Bogatyanovsky Lane (now ‚Äï Kirov Avenue). Construction was completed in 1909 and on May 9, Old Style (May 22, New Style) the new church, named New-Intercession (–ù–æ–≤–æ-–ü–æ–∫—Ä–æ–≤—Å–∫–∞—è), was consecrated. However, the old damaged church had still stood for quite a long time and was demolished only in 1917.  Description of the church built in 1909  New Church of the Intercession The building was constructed in Russian Revival style and had a width of 34 metres, 53 metres in length and also 53 metres in height (together with the cross). The height of the bell tower was 74,5 meters, with the main bell weighing 5100 kg. The church constituted a three-altar temple, including the main ‚Äï Basil altar and two chapels: the right one was consecrated in the name of St. Dimitry of Rostov and the left one ‚Äï in the name of the St. George. All marble works were done by Italian artist E.R. Mintseoni. The arches, domes, and temple walls were painted by artists I. Lavrov and I. Smirnov. The church originally had electric lighting. In 1930 the church was demolished. In the following years a fountain was constructed on its place. Later there was also established a public garden and constructed a Monument to Sergey Kirov (it is said that for construction of this monument there were used marble slabs left from the church)  Restoration of the church  In the post-soviet times, there were talks about the restoration of the church. On 3 February 2005, at the Kirov public garden was installed and consecrated a memorial cross and was laid the first symbolic stone in the foundation of the new church. Construction of the temple was funded by donations from all over Russia. The church, built on the project of architect G. Shevchenko, received the name of Old-Intercession (–°—Ç–∞—Ä–æ- –ü–æ–∫—Ä–æ–≤—Å–∫–∞—è) and was consecrated on November 11, 2007 by the Archbishop of Rostov and Novocherkassk Panteleimon.

It was withdrawn from service in either 1960 or 1963 and since 1986, it has served as a monument. One of its operators was the mail contractor, Tom Kruse. Construction Tom Brennan was built in early 1949 by the South Australian Harbors Board in response to a proposal by the stock agency, Dalgety & Co. Ltd for a ferry to move people and goods across Cooper Creek at the Kopperamana Crossing on the Birdsville Track when creek was in flood. It is described as being ‚Äúa steel punt with airtight tanks, powered by a 4 horse power outboard motor.‚Äù The vessel was named after Mr. T. R. Brennan, the Livestock Manager with Dalgety & Co. Ltd, who is attributed as having the idea to provide a ferry service. Career It was finished in May 1949 and was delivered by Dalgety & Co. Ltd by rail to Marree where it was collected by Tom Kruse who was the mail contractor for the area between Marree and Birdsville. The barge was reported as being in constant use for the first three years of service; in particular, the ‚ÄúCopper Crossing was impassable for six months‚Äù in 1949. The barge was featured in The Back of Beyond, the 1954 documentary produced by John Heyer, being used by Tom Kruse and a passenger to move goods across a flooded creek. In either 1960 or 1963, it was replaced with a larger vessel capable of transporting both stock and vehicles operated by either one of the following South Australian government departments - the Engineering and Water Supply Department or the Highways Department. Current status As of 2016, Tom Brennan is located on the west side of the Birdsville Track to the south of the Cooper Creek in the gazetted locality of Etadunna within what is reported as being a camping ground. It was restored in 1986 by the South Australian Highways Department as part of celebrations of South Australia‚Äôs 150th anniversary and was dedicated as a monument later in 1986 along with the installation of a plaque which is inscribed with the following: > M.

Earthworks and Beyond: Contemporary Art in the Landscape. New York: Abbeville Press, 1989. Along with these works, Zimmerman has exhibited drawings and photographs since graduating with an MFA in painting and photography at 'University of California, Los Angeles in 1972. Her teachers included Robert Heineken, Robert Irwin, and Richard Diebenkorn. In the mid 1970s Zimmerman created a number of temporary, site-specific installations for museum and gallery exhibitions. Some of these projects were presented at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago; Hudson River Museum, NY; Walker Art Center, Minneapolis; Berkeley Art Museum, Berkeley; Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Los Angeles; and the Hirshhorn Museum, Washington, DC. Zimmerman's permanent sculpture works, beginning in the 1980s, range from studio pieces and private commissions, to large scale projects for civic, university and corporate sites. She was most recently awarded the 2016 Isamu Noguchi Award alongside Tadao Ando.  Biography  Zimmerman's career as a sculptor began when she returned to California after a trip to India in 1977 where she was profoundly inspired by the archeological sites she visited.Moran, Tom et al. \\"Elyn Zimmerman: Places + Projects, Forty Years\\". Grounds For Sculpture, 2018: 9-17, 24, 45, 169-171.Hummer, Tracey. ‚ÄúThe Stone Interviews: Interview with Elyn Zimmerman.‚Äù Sculpture Magazine. May‚ÄìJune. 1997: PAGES. Print. This trip precipitated her interest in doing outdoor projects and to work with stone. Upon her return she was invited to do temporary outdoor works at venues such as Artpark, Lewiston, NY; 1980 Winter Olympics,Larsen, Kay. \\"Expulsion from the Garden: Environmental Sculpture at the Winter Olympics\\". ArtForum. February, 1980. Lake Placid, NY; Laguna Gloria Art Museum, Austin, TX, and other spaces.Moran, Tom et al. \\"Elyn Zimmerman: Places + Projects, Forty Years\\". Grounds For Sculpture, 2018: 11, 24-30, 45, 169-170. As she has written, the ability to experiment with new materials and to learn while creating these temporary projects was invaluable and gave her confidence to create the permanent commissions that came later.Moran, Tom et al. \\"Elyn Zimmerman: Places + Projects, Forty Years\\". Grounds For Sculpture, 2018. These permanent projects, beginning in 1980, are recognized for their use of stone, water, (reflecting pools, fountains) and landscape elements. Included among these large scale, public commissions is a fountain to memorialize the 1993 World Trade Center bombing in New York City;Emory, David. \\"World Trade Center Artworks Destroyed\\".

Early influences  During her undergraduate years at UCLA, Zimmerman took classes in the fine arts program while completing a BA in perceptual psychology. It was her knowledge in this discipline and her interest in contemporary art that led her to start working for Jim Turrell and Robert Irwin, doing research for their joint project for the Art and Technology exhibition at LACMA in 1967.Moran, Tom et al. \\"Elyn Zimmerman: Places + Projects, Forty Years\\".

In the 1960s and 1970s Los Angeles was home for many art communities as well as quality art colleges: Chouinard Art Institute, Otis Parsons Art Institute, California Institute of the Arts, and the art departments at UCLA and USC. To compensate for the scarcity of art museums interested in contemporary art and the lack of art galleries, save for well-known Ferus Gallery founded by Walter Hopps, there were alternative art exhibition spaces, such as L.A.C.E and LAICA. In 1962 ArtForum was founded in San Francisco; the Feminist Art Movement began in 1971 with roots at CalArts; LACMA initiated the first museum exhibition of Art &Technology;, and what came to be called the LA Light and Space Movement was generated, making use of unconventional venues to exhibit artist's projects.Moran, Tom et al. \\"Elyn Zimmerman: Places + Projects, Forty Years\\".

Zimmerman's work in graduate school was influenced by this rich environment as well as by the young architect she lived with during those years. He had been in the peace corps and traveled through India, Nepal and Central Asia. The images and cultural influences he shared when they met fueled her desire to travel and investigate the world herself. Together they traveled throughout the American southwest and to Mexico to see Native American and Pre-Columbian archeological sites, as well as visit the progressive modern architecture. Between her undergraduate and graduate years Zimmerman worked in a diverse number of positions. She was a part-time studio assistant for several artists until she was hired to work at Columbia Records in Hollywood as assistant to the head designer in the art department. She left that job when an offer came from the Charles and Ray Eames office in Venice to be the assistant to the house photographer and to run their darkroom.  Later influences  Zimmerman and Kirk Varnedoe began a correspondence in 1975 after he wrote an enthusiastic article about the drawing and photographic piece she exhibited in the 1974 Whitney Biennial.Kirk Varnedoe, ‚ÄúSite Lines: Recent Work by Elyn Zimmerman‚Äù Arts Magazine, vol. 52 (December 1978), 148. She was in NYC in 1976 to install a project at PS1Varnedoe, Kirk. \\"Artifact or Fact Art: Transparent Problems in Photography\\". Arts Magazine, 1975. when they met for coffee, from that point on engaging in a long distance relationship. In 1977 Zimmerman moved to New York City where she and Varnedoe shared a loft in the newly named Tribeca neighborhood. They married in 1983. He was a professor of art history at NYU's Institute of Fine Art and she taught studio classes at SUNY Purchase.Moran, Tom et al. \\"Elyn Zimmerman: Places + Projects, Forty Years\\". Grounds For Sculpture, 2018: 171-177. Varnedoe's deep knowledge of western art history and his widely celebrated talent to convey this information to students, colleagues and friends enriched Zimmerman's understanding of and appreciation for these traditions. On the other hand, her studies of oriental art history, her residency in Japan, and travels to India and China became new interests of his. In 1979, the National Endowment for the Arts started a new program called Art in Public Places.\\"Elyn Zimmerman.\\" U.S. Commission of Fine Arts: Past Commission Members. U.S. Commission of Fine Arts, 2008. Web. 11 April 2018. https://www.cfa.gov/about-cfa/who-we-are/elyn-zimmerman. Projects using government funds were required to use a percentage of the funds for artworks specific to the project at hand. Zimmerman was awarded one of the first of these projects in 1979, for Fort Lincoln Park in Washington, DC. Although the project was never realized, it began her relationship with Cold Spring Granite Company in Cold Spring, MN. This would become her major source of stone materials for over 30 years. When the National Geographic Society selected David Childs of SOM to design their new headquarters in Washington, DC his office sought out artists who worked with stone.Gopnik, Adam. \\"Marabar\\". Arts Magazine. October, 1984.\\" This became Zimmerman's first substantial commission, reinforcing her desire to pursue this type of artwork and to learn more about all the aspects of creating outdoor public projects including: construction methods; landscape requirements; sustainable building practices and materials sources. It was after spending considerable time at stone quarries that she became interested in also making smaller more intimate stone sculptures.

Both Airbus and Boeing produce aircraft that serve this segment. In the Boeing lineup, it is between the largest Boeing 737 MAX 9 of of maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) for 178 passengers in two classes over a range, and the smallest Boeing 787-8 of for 242 passengers in a 2-class configuration over a range. It was previously covered by Boeing with the largest modern narrowbody, the Boeing 757, typically the -200ER for 200 passengers over with a MTOW, and the smallest widebody, the seven-abreast Boeing 767, typically the -300ER for 269 passengers over with a MTOW. In the Airbus lineup, it is between the A321LR of of MTOW for 206 passengers in two classes over a range, and the A330-800neo of for 257 passengers in three classes over a range.  Boeing Y1 project  In 2006, Boeing was evaluating a successor for the Boeing 737 in the 100‚Äì200 seat market within the Boeing Yellowstone Project as the Y1. In 2008, ILFC's Steven Udvar-Hazy told Boeing to develop a midrange 787 derivative, between the 787-8 and 787-3 and industry consultant Richard Aboulafia observed it would be a good replacement for the Boeing 767-300ER. In 2011, Boeing focused its studies on an aircraft slightly larger than the 145 to 180-seat 737 Next Generation and ruled out developing a bigger 200 seat 757-sized replacement.  Boeing New Light Twin (NLT)  The Boeing New Light Twin (NLT) concept in 2011 was a small, seven-abreast twin-aisle adapted for low-profile LD3-45W containers. In 2011, Boeing was conceptualising a New Light Twin (NLT), a twin-aisle smaller than the 767 with a seven-abreast (2-3-2) economy seating and small LD3-45W containers, as it can be seen in the illustrating picture. The NLT-300ER would have been long to accommodate 204 seats over , while the longer NLT-400 would cover with 241 passengers. Both would have been powered by engines with a fan, and would had a wide, wing designed for a Mach .8 cruise.  Boeing 737 MAX  MAX 10 model at ILA Berlin Air Show 2018 After the 737 MAX launch in late 2011, Boeing confirmed to study a replacement for the long haul 757-200 market, potentially as a further derivative of the 737 Max, as the 757-200 production ceased in 2004 and is replaced on medium haul routes by the Airbus A321 or the 737-900ER. In February 2014, as Airbus was going to overtake Boeing leadership for narrowbodies, especially as the A321neo was outselling the 737 MAX 9, Boeing was pressured to launch a 757 successor. In November, Boeing denied working on a modification of the 737 MAX 9. A parallel development of a MoM aircraft along with the new small airplane (NSA) 737 replacement, similar to when the 757 and 767 were developed in the 1970s, was then under consideration. Boeing finalised the 737 MAX 10 stretch design in early 2017.  Airbus A321LR  The A321LR, a heavier A321neo, was first delivered to Arkia on 13 November 2018 In October 2014, Airbus started marketing a 164 seats, maximum takeoff weight variant with three auxiliary fuel tanks called the Airbus A321neoLR (Long Range) with 100 nm more operational range than the 169 seats Boeing 757-200W, 27% lower trip costs and 24% lower per seat costs; it would be scheduled for introduction in the second half of 2018, two years after the A321neo. Airbus launched the A321LR on 13 January 2015 with Air Lease Corporation as the launch customer, hoping to sell 1,000 examples of the variant. The initial layout of 164 seats (20 in business, 30 in premium economy and 114 in economy) is replaced by a 206-seat configuration (16 in business and 190 in economy) and range is , 500-nm farther than the regular 93.5t MTOW A321. Boeing dismissed Airbus projections of demand for 1,000 aircraft and considers the niche between the 737 MAX 9 and the 787-8 too small for a direct replacement of the 757 but could launch a clean sheet MoM aircraft. The A321neo is outselling the Boeing 4 to 1. The A321LR is seen as a replacement for the 757 for Norwegian Air. On March 30, 2018, an A321LR test airframe carrying the equivalent of 178 passengers and crew completed a nonstop flight from the Seychelles to Toulouse in 11 hours.  Boeing 757 re-engining  One in 20 Boeing 757s is the -300 stretch In February 2014, Boeing marketing Vice President Randy Tinseth said the 737-900ER/MAX 9 covers 95% of the routes flown by a 757. In February 2015, he stated that re-engining the 757 had been studied but there was no business case to support it. It was in response to Air Lease Corporation's Steven Udvar-Hazy comments that Boeing could do it, but Jefferies Group analyst Howard Rubel noted that 15 percent of the 757 fleet, 150 aircraft, are parked and unused, and see no urgency to fill that market niche. Reengining and improving the wings of the existing 757 could be done. While Boeing suggested that the 757 replacement market is very small, operators like La Compagnie disagreed. Delta Air Lines is replacing theirs with Boeing 737-900ERs and A321s. From 2015 onwards, Boeing continued to do studies for a clean sheet aircraft, namely the New Midsized plane, which would have greater range, capacity, and efficiency than the . After the grounding of the 737 MAX, Boeing was reportedly cancelling the NMA indefinitely and scrapping the clean sheet idea to create modified versions of the aging 757 and 767, tentatively called the \\"757-Plus and 767X.\\"  New midsize airplane  Boeing has been studying a New Midsize Airplane since 2015, when it determined that the market was large enough to launch a new design. Multiple airlines expressed interest in a composite, seven-abreast twin-aisle with an elliptical cross-section. It is slated as a 5,000 nmi (9,300 km) range 225 seater and a 4,500 nmi (8,300 km) 275 seater, as market forecasts varies between 2,000 and 4,000. Sold for $65m-$75m, it should generate 30% more revenue than narrowbodies and have 40% lower trip costs than replaced widebodies but would cost $12‚Äì15 billion to develop. A new turbofan could be proposed by GE Aviation/CFM International, Pratt & Whitney or Rolls-Royce plc with a bypass ratio of 10:1 or more and an overall pressure ratio over 50:1. Boeing intends to decide in 2019 whether to offer the new aircraft for sale, leading to a launch decision in 2020 and entry into service around 2025.  Airbus A321 development  As Airbus does not believe small twin-aisle are worthy competitors in this market segment, as exemplified by the A310, it is studying a hypothetical A321neo-plus and A321neo-plus-plus with a new carbon fibre composite wing to counter Boeing for a $1‚Äì2 billion development cost against $15 billion for a new jet. Such a plane would have a MTOW. In April 2018, Airbus shelved studies on the A320/A321neo-plus, as they felt that increasing the rate of narrowbody production is problematic. In June 2018, Airbus was considering an extended range A321XLR to predate the Boeing NMA, with the same capacity and aerodynamic design but more fuel load. It could be launched in 2019 for a 2021/2022 introduction and by July 2018, an extra 200-300 nmi range was secured with the help of a larger center fuel tank, lacking 200 nmi to achieve a range. Airbus could offer a stretched A322neo seating 264‚Äì270 in two classes with more range than the 757-300, perhaps with a new wing for a $2bn development cost.

They were founding members of the ADempiere Foundation and longtime members of Functional and Technical Team at ADempiere. In industry-specific ERP projects in the SME sector they developed several new features based on ADempiere 3.5.4 and rewrote the majority of ADempiere Code to allow a more maintainable, flexible and scalable Software for midsize companies. The user base they built up demanded shorter and more reliable release cycles to allow more flexibility in providing solutions for their requirements. This, plus the already resulted gap in development compared to the latest ADempiere Codebase was the reason for the team to decide in 2015 to officially fork from ADempiere and proceed the development in a new project called metasfresh. Since releasing the code to the public on 6 October 2015 the community and development activity has risen quickly. Despite the fork's young age, metasfresh is currently one of the most active Open Source ERP Projects worldwide according to OpenHUB Statistics. Differences to the ADempiere Project After the fork from Compiere, the ADempiere community followed the open-source model of the Bazaar described in Eric Raymond's article The Cathedral and the Bazaar. The community and codebase were growing fast. The development mainly relied on the architecture inherited from Compiere, which had a tight coupling to the database. The architecture in combination with fast growing complexity leads into longer taking release cycles. Additionally, the license of ADempiere is GPL 2. Open Source projects with licenses compatible to GPL 2 are decreasing, so further development will more and more have to rely on own development which is a threat to a competitive development of Open Source enterprise software. With the fork, metasfresh is choosing a different approach. The main aims of the project are: * Quality Assurance: Building a modern architecture and decoupling the application from the data layer. The aim is to allow to extend the automatic Testing possibilities which are a prerequisite for shorter release cycles with extending functionality. * Legal: Completely rewriting the ADempiere code, to allow to switch the license from GPL2 to GPL3 to allow to choose among a larger amount of modern Open Source projects for further incorporation and development. * Efficiency: Consequent usage of Tools to enable efficient work from requirements analysis over development and testing until build and deployment. * Flexibility: Provide a highly flexible framework for business processes based on a new disposition framework which allows having functional extension points to allow external systems to bind with metasfresh ERP. Currently, the time between stable releases including bug fixes and new features is 1 week according to the project's release notes.

He also did work around Chicano Gay Activism and teaching/advising. Tavera died on February 27, 2000 at 56 years old from kidney cancer.  Career  In a lifetime dedicated to advocacy and activism, Hank Tavera was heavily involved in work surrounding the AIDS epidemic. Tavera worked at the San Francisco City Clinic where he held the position of HIV/AIDS intervention specialist. Between 1986 and 1990, Tavera joined the staff of the San Francisco AIDS Foundation, where he was responsible for running the Client Services department. During his time there, Tavera established bilingual services that centered on women and multiculturalism. In the following years, Tavera played crucial roles as an advocate by participating in the Latino Coalition on AIDS, chairing in the Third World AIDS Advisory Task Force, and becoming a voting delegate for LIFE, a Sacramento LGBT and AIDS lobby. He later co-founded LLEGO (Latina/o Lesbian and Gay Organization) in California as well as National LLEGO, which were both organizations dedicated to the overall empowerment of all who were a part of the greater LGBT community. Hank Tavera and LLEGO were present during the 1993 Washington March for Lesbian, Gay, and Bi Equal Rights and Liberation. Tavera continued his activism in the theatrical world, in which he engaged with Mexican American theater and worked in creating the newsletter for TENAZ Talks Teatro, a publication in La Revista Literaria de El Tecolote, a San Francisco publication that showcased Latina/Chicana women in theater. In addition to this, Tavera was a well-known director of plays, directing nine consecutive years of the Performing Arts Shows of Latina/o Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender Artists at the Mission Cultural Center for Latino Arts. Tavera also worked in education when he served as a high school teacher at St. John Bosco Highschool as well as a college teacher at Santa Barbara City College. His work in education continued when he worked as an advisor at University of California, Santa Barbara.  Personal life  Hank Tavera was heavily influenced by the United Farm Workers grape boycott and the Chicano theater movement, both of which were foundational in his political and artistic values. In regards to Hank Tavera's personal relationships, he was in a domestic partnership for 20 years with Quehal Weso, who he shared a home with. He also had a boyfriend whose name was James Sales and had been dating for a total of 9 years in 1996. His two children are son Mario Tavera and daughter Cecilia Tavera. Tavera also identified as a gay Catholic, and was therefore part of the San Francisco chapter for Dignity/San Francisco, an LGBT Catholic organization dedicated to the \\"wholeness and holiness of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender catholics\\". AIDS activism  San Francisco AIDS Foundation (SFAF)  In 1985, Hank Tavera was hired as a staff member in the San Francisco AIDS Foundation's Client Services department. This was a result of a meeting that took place in May of the same year where SFAF's board members expressed their concerns about a lack of staff members who were committed to accomplishing the organization's goal of outreaching to communities of color.Brier, Jennifer. \\"Marketing Safe Sex: The Politics of Sexuality, Race, and Class in San Francisco, 1983-1991.\\" Infectious Ideas: U.S. Political Responses to the AIDS Crisis. Chapel Hill: The University of North Carolina Press, 2009.  Third World AIDS Advisory Task Force (TWAATF)  Along with running Client Services at SFAF, Tavera was a member of the Latino Coalition on AIDS and chaired the Third World AIDS Advisory Task Force. TWAATF was founded in 1985 in an effort to address the distinct ways men of color accessed AIDS prevention and treatment resources. This included an understanding of \\"the historical reality of racial discrimination in gay institutions,\\" venues that AIDS service organizations like SFAF mainly targeted. Their mission was to \\"[assist] existing AIDS organizations with providing educational material that is relevant, culturally sensitive, and can be understood by our communities\\".

National AIDS Theater Festivals  In 1989, Tavera became the artistic director of the National AIDS Theater Festivals.  Performing Arts Show of Latino/a Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender Artists  In 1991, he became the director of the Performing Arts Show of Latino/a Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender Artists. In 1992, Tavera produced Gustavo Mart√≠n Cravioto's Soy Tu Madre and premiered it at the Mission Cultural Center.

Some of the signs and symptoms include: * stiffness of the legs * appendicular and trunk ataxia * hollow foot and hand deformities * ataxic dysarthria * distal muscle wasting * horizontal gaze nystagmus *spasticity  Genetics  The inheritance pattern is autosomal recessive. The disorder is caused by mutations in the SACS gene on chromosome 13.

An eastward-facing image of a bamboo-framed Catholic church at the base of Alam Udang Bum in Myitkyina district, Kachin State, Myanmar. Most literature about the Holy Cross Mountain is written in Burmese or Kachin language and is not officially available in English. Despite this supposed obscurity, many Irish missionaries have visited the shrine, and its existence is well-known to thousands of residents in Kachin State, according to Francis Daw Tang, Bishop of Myitkyina Diocese.  History  Originally created in 1983, the Holy Cross Mountain was founded by a Kachin priest who petitioned the diocese for the creation of a pilgrimage site for Catholics atop the mountain in Alam. On year later, in 1984, construction of the shrine officially began. Using only hand tools, a jeep from Beijing and limited manpower, the shrine was affixed with a large wooden cross, which stands to this day and is the subject of a number of local legends and the source of purported miracles. According to claim documents submitted to Kachin state's land registry in 2015, the official elevation of the site is 2,800 ft. The road, which snakes up the slope of the mountain, was expanded between the years 1994 and 1995. In 2005 the diocese requested alms to be solicited so heavy equipment could be rented to widen the road to accommodate vehicles. From the 80s onwards until 2013, the mountain was ravaged by forest fires until Kachin state Parliament deemed the land environmentally protected. Presently, a number of warnings are placed on the side of the highway indicating it is forbidden for hunters to light fires at the base of the mountain. On 14 August 2014, the Kachin State legislature and Myitkyina Diocese officially signed a memorandum of understanding indicating land ownership rights of Alam Udang Bum are possessed by the Catholic Diocese of Myitkyina for the purposes of owning and maintaining a green space.
