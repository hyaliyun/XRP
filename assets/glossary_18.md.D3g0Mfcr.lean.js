The stated purpose of the company is to aid North American and European firms in becoming familiar with routine Asian business practices, specifically in marketing their products to India and China, both of which are BRIC countries. Amritt has recently been ranked as one of the Top 10 Consulting Companies of India. Their executives have contributed to various financial magazines, including BusinessWeek and advised both US companies and the US president on doing business with India. Notable clients of Amritt include Kraft Foods, Johnson & Johnson, the British company Reckitt Benckiser, and the French media conglomerate Vivendi. History Amritt was established as an advisory service to facilitate trade between the United States and India. It provides its clients with training workshops on topics like human resources issues in India, the financial and legal environment, and Indian culture. Amritt is located in a Class A building in the Cerritos Towne Center – the power center located in the center of Cerritos, California. Amritt is strategically located midway between the Los Angeles and Orange County business centers. Amritt was founded by Gunjan Bagla, an Indian-American author, businessman, and public speaker. He began his career working for Larsen & Toubro in Mumbai and later worked in the United States as a director of program management for Tandon in California. The president of the Institute's Alumni Association and later charter member of the Indus Entrepreneurs decided to form Amritt in 2004. Both he and employees have travelled extensively to advise companies on US-India-Asia business relations, and Bagla has taught business seminars for industry executives at the California Institute of Technology and UCLA Extension. In September 2010, Amritt's managing director was invited to speak at the CK Prahalad Memorial India Business Conference at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business. In March 2011 executives from Amritt were invited as guest speakers by the USC Marshall School of Business along with several US officials (including U.S. Secretary of Commerce, Gary Locke) and international representatives (including the Indonesian Ambassador, Dino Djalal) and the vice president of Boeing International, Dinesh Keskar. In April 2011, Amritt and Bagla attended the South Asian Studies Association's convention in honor of Ron Somers, President of the U.S. India Business Council, for his works in US-India relations. Bagla and Somers were reported to have had discussion on current US-India relates the topic of which were published in media headlines. Media Attention =Market Reports= Amritt has become well known for its industry surveys and reports on global developers and companies. Amritt is a professional advisory service that helps Western companies leverage global resources and global markets. The Amritt 2008 R&D; Globalization Study is based on responses from 204 online respondents from the U.S. and was conducted in April and May 2008. In this survey on R&D; globalization, Amritt found that 33% of American companies plan to deploy only 11 to 100 R&D; personnel in emerging economies, such as the BRIC countries. Also, a significant number, 16%, said that they may have over 1,000 people working in R&D; in emerging economies. Half of the companies performing R&D; in emerging economies do so to serve those local markets, while 42% said that financial pressures played a part. About a quarter of the respondents, 26%, had trouble finding enough talent in their home regions and 17% sought to accelerate time to market by using additional resources in emerging countries. Anecdotal evidence from the survey suggests that time-to-market is likely to become a more significant driver of R&D; globalization in the near future. Asked about their main worries as they globalize the R&D; function, more than 50% of the companies cited the quality of work from emerging economies. About 24% referred to cross-cultural communications as their main worry. =Indian-English Dictionary= Amritt has released a 700-word Indian-English lexicon to help North American and European companies with expansion into Asian markets.

It was first performed at the Park Theatre in Morristown, New Jersey, on December 2, 1915, with May Naudain in the title role and subsequently received its Broadway premiere on December 23, 1915 at the 44th Street Theatre. Background and performance history Katinka marked the third collaboration between Rudolf Friml and his lyricist Otto Harbach. The show's producer, Arthur Hammerstein, had also produced Friml and Harbach's The Firefly (1912) and High Jinks (1913). The work was originally entitled Elaine, after Hammerstein's daughter, who had a small role in High Jinks and according to the New York Times was to have featured in the new production. In the end, Elaine Hammerstein left Broadway to begin a career in movies, and the operetta's name was changed to Katinka.New York Times (July 14, 1915) and (September 16, 1915) Katinka was first performed at the Park Theatre in Morristown, New Jersey on December 2, 1915 and subsequently moved to the 44th Street Theatre for its Broadway premiere on December 23, 1915.Although most reference works, including Wlaschin (2006) p. 188 and Gänzl (2001) p. 869, give December 23 as the date of the Broadway premiere, Everett (2008) p. 20 gives December 22. The production starring May Naudain and Sam Ash as Katinka and Ivan was conducted by John McGhie and directed by Frank Smithson, with set design by Edward Sundquist and costume design by Paul Arlington. The show was an immediate success and ran on Broadway for 220 performances. It also had personal consequences for Friml, who began an affair with one of the chorus singers, Blanche Betters. The couple married in 1917 and divorced acrimoniously two years later, a fact which caused a New York judge to deny his 1921 request to become a naturalized US citizen.The Sunday Chronicle (July 17, 1921) p. 24 Following its Broadway run, Katinka toured to several American cities including Los Angeles, Boston, Baltimore, St. Louis, and Atlanta and had regular revivals in the US until the late 1940s, as well as radio broadcasts. One of its rare 21st century revivals was in November 2009, when it was performed in concert version by the Comic Opera Guild of Ann Arbor, Michigan.McKee (November 2, 2009) Katinka also enjoyed considerable success outside the United States particularly in Australia and New Zealand. It premiered in New Zealand in April 1918 at the Grand Opera House, Wellington, and in Australia on June 8, 1918 at Her Majesty's Theatre, Melbourne. On both occasions, the title role was sung by Gladys Moncrieff. It was her first starring role and one she was to sing well into the 1940s. Other young performers who appeared in the Australian productions and went on to prominent careers were dancer Robert Helpmann (1930) and actor Cyril Ritchard (1918). Katinka had its UK premiere on August 30, 1923 at the Shaftesbury Theatre with Helen Gilliland in the title role and ran for 108 performances.

If she is found, Strogoff's marriage to Katinka can be annulled on grounds of bigamy, leaving her free to marry Ivan. Katinka and Thaddeus Hopper are also in the city, where she is staying in Hopper's rooms. The arrival of Hopper's wife, Helen, causes complications when she becomes suspicious of the arrangements. Hopper has arranged for Katinka to be hidden in the harem of Izzet Pasha, but Arif Bey, Pasha's warden, mistakenly carries Mrs. Hopper off to the harem instead of Katinka.

She was the prototype and lead ship of the Santa Ana class, also known as los Meregildos, which were built during the following years at Ferrol and Havana and which formed the backbone of the Spanish Navy - the other ships were the Mejicano, Conde de Regla, Salvador del Mundo, Real Carlos, San Hermenegildo, Reina María Luisa and Príncipe de Asturias. Her dimensions were 213.4 Burgos feet (one foot = 0.2786m, so ~ 59m) long, 58 feet (~ 16m) in the beam and a total tonnage of 2,112 tonnes. History She was launched on 28 September 1784 at the Reales Astilleros de Esteiro. She was tested at sea on 28 February 1785 under the captaincy of Félix de Tejada, who reported the test to his commanding officer that the ship \\"kept the battery in good use [even] in a fresh wind and heavy seas\\". The success of the trials led to a royal order that subsequent three-deckers would be built to the same plans. Thémis with Santa Ana in tow in the aftermath of the Battle of Trafalgar. From 1803 to 1804 she was captained by Dionisio Alcalá Galiano. At Trafalgar she was the flagship of Alava and captained by José de Gardoqui - she suffered 97 killed and 141 wounded, with Alava himself seriously wounded, and was captured by the British. However, two days later, a squadron under the command of Commodores Enrique Macdonell and Cosmao- Kerjulien succeeded in recapturing her and getting her back to Cadiz. At the start of the Peninsular War in 1808 she was undergoing repairs at the Arsenal and so could not participate in the capture of the French squadron under Admiral Rosily. She and Príncipe de Asturias moved to Havana in 1810 to avoid capture by the French and sank in its Arsenal in 1816. In 1834 she could still be seen next to the Príncipe de Asturias (which had also sunk) in the mud in front of the Arsenal.

Spill (also known as bleed and leakage) is the occurrence in sound recording (particularly in close miking) and live sound mixing whereby sound is picked up by a microphone from a source other than that which is intended. Spill is usually seen as a problem, and various steps are taken to avoid it or reduce it. In some styles of music, such as orchestral music, jazz, and blues, it is more likely to be accepted or even seen as desirable. Occurrence Spill occurs when sound is detected by a microphone not intended to pick it up (for example, the vocals being detected by the microphone for the guitar). Spill is often undesirable in popular music recording, as the combined signals during the mix process can cause phase cancellation and may cause difficulty in processing individual tracks. It also causes difficulty in overdubbing, where the spill from the sound being replaced may still be audible on other channels. For sound reinforcement in live shows, mic bleed can make it hard for the sound engineer to control the levels of the different instruments and vocals onstage. For example, if an electric guitarist's loud amplifier is bleeding into the drum and vocal mics, it may be hard for the sound engineer to reduce the volume of the guitar in the onstage mix. Spill can also introduce sounds which are not desired as part of the recording or live sound mix, such as the sound of a squeaking piano pedal, the clacking of keys on a bassoon, or the rustling of papers on a public speaker's podium. Spill is sometimes accepted or even desirable, particularly in classical music recordings, as it can create a natural sound between instruments. A guide to orchestral recordings notes that an ″...advantage in using a ribbon mic on the brass is that...there will be a slight pickup of the strings on those mics which gives you a nice depth of field on the strings due to mic bleed (i.e., strings bleeding into the brass mics on the other side of the stage)″.“Orchestral Recording Techniques’ by Christopher L. Stone. Available online at http://cdn.audioimpressions.com/OrchestralRecordingTechniques_R4.pdf Accessed on April 29, 2011. For some classical recordings, the spacious sound of mic bleed is simulated. The ″SPACE programming module... uses delay and phasing to emulate positioning and microphone bleed within a heavily multi- miked sound stage that has come to define that [orchestral] film score sound we are all used to hearing″.http://createdigitalmusic.com/2007/01/namm-divide- and-conquer-with-dvz-for-%E2%80%9Cthat-film-score-sound%E2%80%9D/ This is also true for drum recording and productions that need a \\"live\\" feel. Whereas pop songs are often recorded one track at a time, for jazz and blues and other improvisation-based music, it is often desirable to have the band perform together, because this creates a better \\"feel\\" and more \\"swing\\", and because the musicians typically \\"feed\\" off each other's ideas in real time. For example, in a jazz tune, the \\"comping\\" musicians will alter their improvised accompaniment in response to the solo lines played by the saxophone player; as well, in some cases, the comping musicians will introduce melodic or rhythmic ideas which are picked up by the solo improviser. In Jamaican reggae and dub, mic bleed is purposely used in recordings.Michael E. Veal. Dub: soundscapes and shattered songs in Jamaican reggae.Wesleyan University Press, 2007. p.74 Spill is often experienced with vocal recording, when the accompaniment is monitored through speakers or open-backed headphones. It may also be a problem in studios without talkback facilities.  Avoiding spill  Recording engineers and live sound engineers aim to avoid spill by: * Placing microphones closer to the sound source * Using acoustic barriers (known as gobos); for live sound, plexiglass screens are sometimes used for drums and brass. * Reducing sound reflection in the recording room (e.g., by draping blankets on walls and windows) * Having the different instruments and amplifiers set up in different isolation booths or rooms (particularly with loud electric guitar amplifiers) * Recording every instrument and vocal one at a time using a multi-track recording system. * Using directional microphones * Maximising the distance between sound sources * Using DI units rather than microphones * Using piezoelectric pickups (e.g., with an upright bass) * For vocalists, using closed shell headphones * Cutting frequencies with an equalizer that are not present in the intended microphones's instrument or vocals (e.g., for a bass drum mic, all of the high frequencies could safely be cut; for a piccolo, all of the bass frequencies could be cut) * Align tracks whenever possible, taking into account that there is audio sources more pollutants than others. For that, it is better to use a plug-in tool for \\"finding similarities and time differences\\". Spill is also avoided by using a 3:1 distance rule of thumb, which states that for each unit of distance between a sound source and its microphone, other microphones should be placed at least three times as far. Other methods of minimising spill include the use of noise gates.  Examples  Spill is evident on The Beatles' song \\"Yesterday\\", where Paul McCartney overdubbed his lead vocal. He had originally recorded acoustic guitar and vocals together on different tracks, though the spill of vocals onto the acoustic guitar track gave an effect similar to double tracking. Spill can also be heard on the vocal track of Christina Aguilera's \\"Beautiful\\". Engineer Dave Pensado said that although the vocal track contained spill from Aguilera's headphones, the \\"bleed is honest\\", which suited the song as it was \\"about being beautiful and honest in every way\\". The effect can also be observed when operating a vinyl record player in the same room as the loudspeakers. Depending on the construction of the player the sound may acoustically couple into the record player's dust cover or other mechanical parts and cause a feedback loop into the magnetic cartridge.

The gorge is long and, in places, over deep. It was designated a natural monument in 1912.  Geology and origin  View from the Eiserner Steg into the depths of the gorge The gorge around 1900 The gorge in winter In the Triassic, about 240 million years ago, on the bed of a shallow sea, dark grey, relatively hard layers of Alpine muschelkalk, so- called Wurstelkalk, were laid down in the area of the present day Partnach Gorge. On the bead-like strata of this rock the traces of the burrowing and feeding of marine animals can still be seen. Importantly, about 5 million years later, softer marls were deposited in the same marine basin, which today are known as Partnach Strata (Partnach-schichten). In the course of the subsequent Alpine mountain folding the so-called Warnberg Saddle (Warnberger Sattel) was formed from these rock strata. The erosion force of the Partnach stream, fed from the Schneeferner glacier on the Zugspitzplatt plateau, was great enough to carry away quickly the softer layers, to keep pace with the continued uplifting of the terrain and thus to cut into the hard Alpine muschelkalk as well. Today the river forms the typically narrow valley shape of a gorge (Klamm) in the area of the muschelkalk rocks, while the areas of softer Partnach strata to the north and south have a wider valley cross- section.  Economic significance  The gorge was already being used by local peoples in the 18th century who, at risk of their lives, transported firewood from the Reintal valley on timber rafts to Partenkirchen. From the 18th century to the 1960s the river and the gorge were used as a rafting stream. In spring the logs, marked with an owner's symbol (Hausmach), were thrown into the stream and carried by meltwaters down the valley. The freeing of jammed logs required much daring and men were frequently lost in carrying out this dangerous task. Boards on a wayside cross between the Olympic Stadium and the entrance to the gorge bear witness to these accidents. Since 1912 the gorge has been developed for tourists and can be visited all year round. An entry fee is charged in summer between 8 am and 6 pm and in winter between 9 am and 5 pm. Outside these times the gorge may be visited at individual risk.Website of the Garmisch-Partenkirchen local government garmisch-partenkirchen.de (German) During snowmelt in spring the gorge may also be closed for a short period.  Rockfall  On 1 June 1991 about 5,000 m³ of rock broke away from a rock face at the southern end of the gorge and blocked the old path as well as the watercourse. Fortunately this unexpected rockfall did not claim any lives. A small, natural dammed lake was formed and the Partnach channelled its way through the giant boulders. Since 1992 a long gallery, blasted out of the rock, has bypassed the rock piles and lake. The gallery is lit by windows, from which one can see this natural event in complete safety.About the Partnach gorge partnachklamm.eu (German)  Nearby gorges  In Garmisch- Partenkirchen near Mittenwald there is a smaller gorge, the Leutasch Gorge (Leutaschklamm) on the border with Austria, that has an impressive trail, opened on 24 May 2006. There is also the Höllental Gorge (Höllentalklamm) near Grainau-Hammersbach.  In popular culture  The Partnach Gorge served as a film location for the 1979 film Nosferatu the Vampyre. In an early montage, the protagonist travels through the wilderness to Count Dracula's castle. Although the film's dialogue refers to the route as the Borgo Pass in the Carpathian Mountains (in accordance with Bram Stoker's novel, Dracula), the footage of the narrow passages and rushing water clearly identifies the location as the Partnach.

The school was run by RNIB (Royal National Institute of Blind People). It was based just outside Coventry. The children's home at RNIB Pears Centre offered up to 52-week specialised residential care from new purpose-built bungalows with gardens and outdoor play areas. The children's home supported young people from ages 0–19 years, whether or not they attended the school and each young person had their own bedroom which was made safe and personal to them. RNIB Pears Centre also offered individually tailored therapies from an in-house team of therapists and healthcare consultants, including behavioural specialists trained in the care of people with learning disabilities, nurses, physiotherapists and speech and language therapists. RNIB Pears Centre was categorised by Ofsted as a special, non-maintained school for 2 to 19-year olds and as a children's home. Each service was inspected independently of one another by Ofsted. The children's home was rated as 'Outstanding' by Ofsted in November 2011. The school also achieved an 'Outstanding' Ofsted grading in February 2013, but in November 2017 it was graded as inadequate.Ofsted website On Tuesday 4 September 2018 the RNIB announced both the children's home and school will close on 7 November 2018, as the RNIB closed the children's home on site.

He was the first person to be hanged at Bristol New Gaol. Life John Horwood was born in Hanham, the third child of Thomas and Pheebee Horwood. Raised in a mining family, he refused to work in the mines after his older brother died in a shaft explosion. Death of Eliza Balsom (Balsum/Balsam) and aftermath Horwood escalated from harassment to violent attacks on Eliza Balsom, an older girl with whom he had become infatuated, before he murdered her in 1821. > \\"It appears that Horwood for some time past, teased the girl with proposals, > which she had uniformly and indignantly refused: and having lattlerly > endeavoured to intimidate her with his threats, she became alarmed at his > conduct, and took every means of avoiding him.”Smith, Richard, ‘Shocking > Outrage’, unknown newspaper cutting pasted into The Horwood Book, Bristol > Archives reference number: 35893/36/V_i, p21 This newspaper report included in The Horwood Book goes on to document multiple attacks on Ms Balsom by Horwood through 1820 and 1821 including throwing oil of vitriol (sulphuric acid) at her. It was suggested by the prosecution at the time that John Horwood was associated with the \\"Cock Road Gang\\", notorious for being violent troublemakers.Bishop, Ian S, The Cock Road Gang, 2003, Oldland Common On 25 January 1821, he saw Eliza Balsom with another boy and threw a stone which struck her on the temple. The stone caused only minor injury, but she was treated at the Bristol Royal Infirmary for a depressed fracture. She died four days later on 17 February 1821. According to the diary of medical cases kept by Dr Edward Estlin (ref. 35893/32/a) (online catalogue) held at Bristol Archives, Eliza Balsom's wound was greatly infected five days after the attack and Dr Richard Smith needed to clear the infection from inside the skull so undertook a trepanning procedure to cut away the bone. Smith discovered an abscess under the surface of the skull which caused the death of Eliza Balsom.Smith, Richard, The Horwood Book, Bristol Archives reference number: 35893/36/V_i, p18 Dr. Smith gave Horwood's name to the police, so police officers, sheriff's yeomen and members of the public went to Hanham to detain him. > “The villain guessed their errand, and tried to jump out from a bedroom > window in his shirt… he seized a quarryman’s hammer, and placing himself on > the top of the stairs, threatened, with horrid oaths, the destruction of all > who approached… The villain made a great many blows with his hammer… The > Officers closed upon him, knocked him down and after a desperate conflict, > at last handcuffed him and dragged him to the carriage. The trial took place at the Star Inn in Bedminster on 11 April 1821, with Smith testifying against him. The prosecution included a phrenological report undertaken by Mary Anne SchimmelpenninckSmith MD, G. Munro, A History of the Bristol Royal Infirmary, 1917 to attempt to prove Horwood's guilt by the shape of his skull. This claimed that his chief mental characteristics were 'combativeness', 'self-esteem', and 'hope', however the 'bump of murder' which was supposedly a cranial characteristic of all murderers was not present.Smith, Richard, The Horwood Book, Bristol Archives reference number: 35893/36/V_i, The strongest point in Horwood's defence was that the abscess on the brain might have been caused by the unclean dressings on the wound,Halliwell, Dave, An Unjust Hanging: The True Story of John Halliwell, Memoirs Publishing, 2012, p102 and not directly by the stone attack though it would appear that this evidence was never put forward. He was hanged two days later on temporary gallows erected above the New Gaol's gatehouse and his body was handed back to Smith for dissection in a public lecture at Bristol Royal Infirmary. The crowds gathered to watch the public hanging were so large that posters were put up warning people from being crowded over the bank of the New Cut and drowned. The Horwood Book The skeleton of John Horwood, 18, hanging from a noose in a Bristol University cupboard Horwood's friends attempted to rescue the body on its route to Bristol Royal Infirmary for 'anatomisation' (dissection) and spirit it away on the river back to Hanham. Dr Richard Smith second-guessed their plan and took the body by taxi during the night. As part of the process of 'anatomisation' Horwood's skin had to be removed. In other cases the skin would have been incinerated as medical waste, but Dr Smith being an antiquarian chose to tan the skin, and use it to bind the papers documenting the murder, trial, execution and subsequent dissection. Horwood's remains were retained for medical dissection. The cost of the binding was £1.10 shillings,Bill of Sale kept in the front of The Horwood Book, Bristol Archives reference number: 35893/36/V_i, p1 which is worth approximately £130 in the 21st century.

The skin on the front cover is embossed with a gallows motif and skulls and crossbones, with the Latin words Cutis Vera Johannis Horwood which translates to 'The True Skin of John Horwood'. The practice of anthropodermic bibliopegy is known to have been practised since the 17th century, and it was common to use a murderer's skin in this manner during the 18th and 19th centuries. Smith kept the skeleton at his home until his death, when it was passed to the Bristol Royal Infirmary and later to Bristol University. The skeleton was kept hanging in a cupboard at Bristol University with the noose still around its neck. 21st century funeral John Horwood's funeral, 13 April 2011.

The name Chaghri is Turkic (Çağrı in modern Turkish) and literally means \\"small falcon\\", \\"merlin\\".\\"ČAḠRĪ BEG DĀWŪD\\" Encyclopædia Iranica Background Chaghri and his brother Tughril were the sons of Mikail and the grandsons of Seljuq. The Great Seljuq Empire was named after the latter, who was a Turkic clan leader either in KhazarArthur Koestler: The thirteenth Tribe (translated by Belkıs Çorakçı), Say, İstanbul, 1984, p.164 or Oghuz states. In the early years of the 11th century, they left their former home and moved near the city of Jend (now a village) by the Syr Darya river, where they accepted the suzerainty of the Karakhanids in Transoxania (roughly modern Uzbekistan and southern Kazakhstan). After the defeat of the Karakhanids by Ghaznavids, they were able to gain independence.  Biography  Very little is known of Chaghri and Tughril's lives until 1025. Both were raised by their grandfather Seljuq until they were fifteen and fought with Ali Tigin Bughra Khan, a minor Kara Khanid noble, against Mahmud of Ghazni.Caghri-Beg, Cl. Cahen, The Encyclopaedia of Islam, Vol. II, ed. B.Lewis, C. Pellat and J. Schacht, (E.J. Brill, 1991), 4. The earliest records of Chaghri concern his expeditions in Eastern Anatolia. Although a Ghaznavid governor chased him from his home in Jend to Anatolia, he was able to raid the Byzantine forts in Eastern Anatolia.Prof. Yaşar Yüce- Prof. Ali Sevim: Türkiye tarihi Cilt I, AKDTYKTTK Yayınları, İstanbul, 1991 p 28-29 However, according to Claude Cahen this was highly improbable and of legend.Caghri beg, Claude Cahen, The Encyclopaedia of Islam, Vol. II, 4, 5; \\"Tradition gives here an account of a highly improbable escapade of Caghri-Beg in Armenia.\\", \\"On the legendary escapade of Caghri in Armenia, the article of Ibrahim Kafesoglu, \\"Dogu Anadoluya ilk selcuklu adini\\", in \\"Fuad Koprulu Armagam\\", 1953, and my discussion with him in JA 1954, 275 ff. and 1956, 129 ff.\\" From 1035 to 1037 Chaghri and Tughril fought against Mas'ud I of Ghazni. Chaghri captured Merv (an important historical city now in Turkmenistan).'Izz al-D in Ibn al-Athir, The Annals of the Saljuq Turks, 36. Between 1038 and 1040 Chaghri fought against the Ghaznavids, usually with hit and run maneuvers and culminating in a major clash at the Battle of Dandanaqan. Tughril was rather hesitant and preferred continuing the hit-and-run attacks, but Chaghri commanded the Seljuk army and preferred direct confrontation.Ümit Hassan (ed. Sina Akşin) Türkiye Tarihi I, CemYayınevi, İstanbul,2009, p. 167 At Dandanaqan, the Seljuks defeated the numerically superior Gaznavid army. A kurultai was held after the battle, by which empire was divided between the two brothers. While Tughril reigned in the west (comprising modern western Iran, Azerbaijan and Iraq), Chaghri reigned in eastern Iran, Turkmenistan, and Afghanistan, a region collectively referred to as Greater Khorasan. Chaghri later also captured Balkh (in modern North Afghanistan). In 1048, he conquered Kerman in South Iran and, in 1056, the Sistan region (south east Iran).History page After the Seljuqs had gained more influence over the Abbasid Caliphate, Chaghri married his daughter, Arslan Khatun Khadija, to the caliph Al-Qa'im in 1056.The Political and Dynastic History of the Iranian World, C.E. Bosworth, The Cambridge History of Iran, Vol. 5, ed. J. A. Boyle, (Cambridge University Press, 1968), 48.Dailamīs in Central Iran: The Kākūyids of Jibāl and Yazd, C. E. Bosworth, Iran, Vol. 8, (1970), 86. Death Chaghri died in Sarakhs, in North-eastern Iran. The historical sources do not agree on the exact date of his death: years 1059, 1060, 1061 and 1062 were proposed. But it is purported that numismatics can be used to determine the exact death date. Coins were minted in the name of Chaghri up to 1059 and in the name of his son Kavurt after 1060, so Chaghri's death can be ascribed more probably to 1059.A paper on Chaghri's death date Upon death, he was succeeded as Governor of Khorasan by his son, Alp Arslan.  Legacy  Battle of Dandanaqan Unlike later Ottoman practice, in earlier Turkic tradition, brothers usually participated in government affairs.(Bumin – İstemi in the 6th century, Bilge Khan – Kultegin in the 8th century are notable examples.) Tughril and Chaghri as well as some other members of the family participated in the foundation of the empire. Although Tughril gained the title \\"sultan\\", it was Chaghri’s sons who continued it afterwards. Chaghri had six sons and four daughters. Among his sons, Alp Arslan became the sultan in 1064. All the remaining members of the Great Seljuq Empire were from Chaghri’s lineage. (Except Seljuks of Rum). Another son, Kavurt, became the governor of Kerman (which later on became fully independent); a third son, Yaquti, became the governor of Azerbaijan.

To the surprise of many involved in the program, the helicopters proved extremely dangerous to the fighters when they were properly employed, racking up a 5-to-1 kill ratio over the fighters when fighting at close ranges with guns. The tests were a response to the introduction of the Mil Mi-24 \\"Hind\\" helicopter in Warsaw Pact (WTO) forces. In earlier tests like Ansbach, anti-tank helicopters proved to be potent weapons and much of NATOs 1970s strategy was based on using helicopters to blunt a WTO attack. If the Soviets introduced their own helicopters, NATO might be at a disadvantage once again. Previously NATO had relied on having almost complete air supremacy during a war, so the obvious answer to the Hind problem was to shoot them down. J-CATCH was organized to provide doctrine to fighter pilots on how to best accomplish this task. Given the surprising results in close-range combat, the main lesson was that helicopters should only be engaged at long range using look-down weapons like the AIM-7 and AIM-9. Background Prior to J-CATCH, there had been little effort in the US to explore fighter-helicopter tactics. One of the earliest involved MASH Sikorsky H-19's, which the Army believed would be easy targets for enemy fighters. Many years later, in 1971 the new Combat Development Evaluation Center conducted an experiment with Army Bell AH-1 Cobras vs. US Navy F-4 Phantoms.Vallimont, p. 25. The latter demonstrated that the Cobra was a fleeting target when employed over land, but worried about the Navy, whose search and rescue helicopters operated over water with no cover available. By the 1970s it was clear the Soviets were dramatically increasing their own helicopter force. The urgency of this threat grew as the west learned of the capabilities of the Hind and (later) the 9K114 Shturm (AT-6 Spiral) anti-tank missile. The platform represented a serious threat to NATO armour. The results of earlier experiments, and the lack of modern organic air-defence units in the Army, suggested that the Hind would run rampant over the battlefield. J-CATCH Starting in 1978 the situation was addressed with the organization of the J-CATCH program. =Phase I= This started with simulator efforts in the Differential Maneuvering Simulator (DMS) at NASA Langley in May 1978. The DMS was developed to simulate two spacecraft or aircraft maneuvering together,. and was a natural fit for simulating one-on-one encounters between helicopters and other aircraft. Aircrew from the Army, Marines, Military Airlift Command and the Tactical Air Command participated in the tests, which involved the simulation of both armed and unarmed helicopters. =Phase II= Experience from the simulator tests led to a series of field studies in Phase II, studying helicopter vs. helicopter tactics, a field that had never been officially studied before. The tests took place at Fort Rucker, Alabama.Vallimont, p. 26. Blue Force, representing a US Army anti-armour group, was taken from forces based at Fort Rucker, including three AH-1 Cobras and two OH-58 Scouts. Selecting a force to represent Red Team was not so easy. The Hind was a large aircraft with high speed and relatively low maneuverability, like the CH-3E Sea King, but heavily armed with a two-man crew, like the Cobra. This role was filled by the 20th Special Operations Squadron, 1st Special Operations Wing at Hurlburt Field in Florida. The 20th's primary mission is infiltration/exfiltration of special operations units, and were equipped (at the time) with the Bell UH-1N Twin Huey and CH-3E Sea King. CIA intelligence officers who had some knowledge of the Hind were called in to brief the 20th's pilots on what little was known of the new aircraft, and its tactics. The Hind was in some respects a combination of these two aircraft, so they were used in concert in an attempt to simulate it. In order to provide a reasonable gun system, a number of Emerson Mini-TAT turrets were loaned by the Canadian Forces, who used the system on their own UH-1Ns.. These missions developed a number of new helicopter air-to-air maneuvering (HAAM) techniques, which had not been considered before J-CATCH. Helicopters proved to be every bit as capable of air combat as their fixed-wing brethren, at least when operating against other helicopters. =Phase III= To answer the question of whether or not the same was true in helicopter-vs-fighter encounters, a selection of F-4, A-7, A-10 and F-15 aircraft were selected by the Air Force to take part in the tests. The F-4 and F-15 represented front-line fighters who might be ordered to deal with helicopters as part of their anti-air roles, while the A-7 and A-10 represented ground-attack aircraft who might encounter helicopters as part of their missions near the front lines. During the two- week exercise, the helicopters proved devastating to the fixed-wing aircraft. In most cases the fighter pilots had no idea they were being \\"attacked\\" until they returned to base for debriefing. This led to a series of claims and counter-claims, so for the second week the helicopter pilots were instructed to follow Air Force procedure and call out \\"guns-guns-guns\\" when \\"firing\\". The kill ratio in favour of the helicopters climbed even higher during this period. Over the entire two-week period, the outcome was a 5-to-1 ratio in favour of the helicopters.. As the exercise continued, the 20th increasingly took on the role of the Soviet pilots. The maintenance crews hung a red tablecloth on a pole and mounted it to the back of their truck, and then added red scarves made of cut up rags. Aircrew took up this bit of flair, which has remained part of the uniform of the 20th to this day. A red star was added as a mission patch.. =Phase IV and on= The surprising outcome of Phase III was not ignored. In Phase IV through VI of the project, during 1979, the lessons learned in Phase II and III were digested and fed back to the aircrews through new combat doctrine. The official report details how the F-15 was able to lock on to the helicopters around 64 km. However it did not get visual ID until 6-9 km. (Beyond-visual range combat wasn't practiced at this exercise.) When AIM-7 Sparrows were employed for the F-15, it stacked a 2.9-1 kill ratio on the helicopters. F-4s with 20 mm cannons were less fortunate, stacking up a 0.7-1 kill ratio. The A-10 did slightly better with its 30 mm gun stacking up a 1.3-1 kill ratio. Due to their maneuverability, helicopters are very dangerous opponents when matched against fixed winged aircraft. To this day, the basic lesson is that fighters should stay away from helicopters, and only attack from high altitudes or at long ranges (beyond visual range with missiles) and only if the situation presents itself. Helicopter hunters The introduction of newer attack helicopters, and the expected proliferation of existing types, led to a number of design studies for aircraft that would be able to protect a wide area of the front from these attacks. In particular, in 1981 the Army started the Low Cost Battlefield Attack Aircraft project and eventually built the Scaled Composites ARES to test these concepts. In the UK, British Aerospace started a similar project called Small Agile Battlefield Aircraft.

Fatigue duty (or fatigue labor) is the labor assigned to military men that does not require the use of armament. Parties sent on fatigue duty were known in English by the French term \\"en détachement\\" according to an 1805 military dictionary.  History  The term is recorded in America in 1776,Oxford English Dictionary quotes A. Ward in J. Sparks Corr. Amer. Revol. (1853) I. 191, \\"I‥have ordered all the men, not on actual duty, to turn out upon fatigue every day.\\" and in an 1805 British military dictionary. = United States = File:FatigueCall.mp3 US Army call for all designated personnel to report to fatigue duty. In the United States, the allowance of soldiers employed at work on fortifications, in surveys, in cutting roads, and other constant labor, of not less than ten days, was authorized by an act approved March 2, 1819, entitled An act to regulate the pay of the army when employed on fatigue duty and paid twenty-five cents per day for men employed as ordinary laborers and teamsters, and thirty-five to fifty cents per day for men employed as mechanics, depending on their location. US soldiers on fatigue duty were allowed an extra gill of whiskey by the act of March 2, 1819. For a time in the 1870s, US Marine Corps company grade officers were supposed to wear an English model \\"pillbox\\" or \\"round cap\\" for fatigue duty, but it was never popular. In Article 15 of the US Army Regulations of 1861, correctional custody includes fatigue duties, which is defined as follows: During the American Civil War, Black soldiers were constantly assigned to fatigue labor, to the point it had become regular slavery. Complaints were made to President Lincoln. Commitments to avoid this discrimination were expressed – General Lorenzo Thomas had released the General Orders 21 outlawing discriminatory fatigue labor – but powerful US army leaders often turned a blind eye to this progressive intention whenever deemed necessary.

Murder and case development  At 6:44 PM on 26 November 2010, Yara Gambirasio left the Brembate di Sopra, Italy sport center alone, but never reached her home 700 meters away. Her family soon called the Carabinieri, From Repubblica website but despite a search involving hundreds of volunteers, her body was not found until 26 February 2011 in Chignolo d'Isola, 10 kilometers from Brembate di Sopra. The body showed multiple superficial cuts, possibly made by a pointed object such as a nail or a knife, and a large wound on the head. In August 2011 a final autopsy report had not yet been released and not even the exact cause of death had been ascertained, but leaked details from the investigation suggested that the death was caused by the combination of a head blow (as from falling on a hard surface or being hit with a stone), at least six cut wounds (none deadly) and freezing. It did not appear that Gambirasio was raped. From Corriere della Sera Yara's funeral took place on 28 Nov 2011 and was presided over by the bishop of Bergamo Francesco Beschi. The first suspect was a Moroccan young man who was arrested after a comment he made was mistranslated but then quickly exonerated. After a trace of genetic material was taken from the victim's pants and leggings, forensic scientists analyzed and compared about 22,000 DNA profilesIn Search for Killer, DNA Sweep Exposes Intimate Family Secrets in Italy and the search began for a suspect with matching DNA, referred to as \\"Ignoto 1\\" (Unknown 1, the identifying nickname given by investigators to the murderer of Gambirasio). On 16 June 2014 an Italian bricklayer living and working in the area, Massimo Giuseppe Bossetti, was arrested and accused of being the murderer, mainly by virtue of his DNA matching \\"Ignoto 1\\"'s. While the deceased father of \\"Ignoto 1\\", Giuseppe Guerinoni, who had died in 1999, was identified relatively quickly, the search for the actual suspect was much longer and complicated because he was an illegitimate son of Guerinoni - a circumstance apparently totally unknown to anyone else previously; the suspect only became the target of investigations after his mother was tested for DNA and the tests showed it likely that the suspect was one of her sons. Because the investigators wanted to observe the suspect for several months before confronting him, the DNA match of Massimo Giuseppe Bossetti with that of \\"Ignoto 1\\" was confirmed during an apparently routine breathalyzer test, which was performed specifically with the intention of obtaining Bossetti's DNA. Bossetti proclaimed his innocence right from the arrest (stating that he suffered from epistaxis and that someone had stolen his work tools, including a knife, an awl and a trowel, possibly blood-soiled for this reason, and that the DNA proof was fabricated, due to either excessive exposure to the weather or human miscarriage), but police maintained that the sample was \\"of excellent quality\\" and Bossetti was denied any chance of a plea bargain or confession, despite his charge of life imprisonment. His wife confirmed his alibi, but she was not believed, also based on some phone recordings.Yara Gambirasio, genetista: \\"Dna certo\\". Legali Bossetti presenteranno ricorso In January 2015 a scientific adviser to the court stated that the MtDNA of \\"Ignoto 1\\" might not match that of Bossetti, and that there might be the possibility of an error. According to rumors, as early as July 2013, the DNA showed no correspondence with the genetic maternal line of Massimo Bossetti (a fact explained with a comparison error among thousands of samples), while that correspondence was found after a further analysis on the illegitimate child - after the suggestion of an acquaintance - of Ester Arzuffi (the mother of the suspect). If Bossetti appears to be Guerinoni's son, there are still doubts even on the nuclear DNA and its correspondence with the profile of the suspect. The attorney refused, however, to question the evidence, as requested by the lawyers of Bossetti, who have repeated several times the request for release of their client, and asked to declare him not guilty in a future trial. Bossetti's lawyer said that «there is an obvious anomaly, the mitochondrial DNA does not match the nuclear DNA. This should at least make us raise a question: whether the whole process which led to the identification of DNA has been done with the most absolute correctness, or not».Caso Yara, salta la prova regina: per consulente della Procura DNA mitocondriale non è di BossettiYara, parla la Procura: «Quel Dna è di Bossetti»Yara, legale Bossetti: \\"Il dna non è il suo\\"Yara, l'avvocato Salvagni: ecco lo sporco gioco contro Bossetti An instructor at the gym, Silvia Brena, has been the focus of attention of Bossetti's defence. Her blood was found on the sleeves of Yara's jacket, identified by DNA. On the night of Yara's disappearance, Silvia Brena's father has said that she cried all night, although she has given no reason for this. Under questioning she said that she remembered nothing and could not explain why she and her brother had sent text messages to each other at the time of Yara's disappearance which they had almost immediately deleted without deleting other messages sent before and after. On 1 July 2016 the Corte d'Assise of Bergamo sentenced Bossetti to life imprisonment.DNA evidence and family secrets snare Italian child murderer In July 2017 the Corte d'Assise d'Appello di Brescia upheld the verdict.

Description Female of Haematopota pluvialis Haematopota pluvialis can reach a length of , with a wingspan of 8–10 mm.Commanster These species has large compound eyes necessary for locating their prey. They are hairy and brightly colored, with stripes extended over most of the eye. In the males eyes do touch in the centre of the frons and the colored stripes are restricted to the lower part.Nature Spot Female in a wet meadow The first antennal segment is quite bulbous and has a strong sub-apical notch in the female. The thorax is grey, with black longitudinal stripes. The abdomen shows a dark background with a series of lateral pale spots and clearer bands at the end of each black segment. Also the wings have a distinctive pattern, being dark mottled by several clear spots. The legs are black, with yellowish-brown rings.Influential Points This species is similar to the also common Haematopota crassicornis, but differs from that species in the orange third antennae segment, in the presence of the sub-apical notch and in the overall brown colouration compared to the often grey tinge of crassicornis. Biology These Horse Flies can be encountered during the daylight hours from late May through late October. The males are harmless and feed on nectar, while the females feed on mammal blood (hematophagy) (hence the Latin name Haematopota pluvialis, literally meaning 'blooddrinker of the rains'), mainly cattle and horses, needing blood for developing eggs. When they bite they inject fluids inhibiting the coagulation of blood, which flows out in such a way that allows the horsefly to lap it. They are also able to bite people painfully. Females lay their eggs at the base of grass-stems or on the surface of moist soil.

At the Star Wars 40th anniversary, Blalack spoke to the assembled crew: “All of us changed the direction of filmmaking. Because of you, visions once completely impossible are now within reach. And you know it wasn’t always like that. We discovered that building ILM from scratch during production was like jumping out of a low-budget airplane, and stitching up a parachute during freefall.”  Star Wars Academy Award (1978)  Blalack receives the 1978 Best Visual Effects Academy Award for his work on Star Wars. = Cosmos: A Personal Voyage = In 1980 Blalack produces Visual Effects for 12 of the 13 episodes of Carl Sagan's Cosmos: A Personal Voyage, in collaboration with the series producer Adrian Malone. = The Day After = In 1983, Blalack designs and produces The Day After visual effects.

It is named after Russian American Igor Ansoff, an applied mathematician and business manager, who created the concept. Diagram showing the Ansoff Matrix  Growth strategies  Ansoff, in his 1957 paper, provided a definition for product-market strategy as “a joint statement of a product line and the corresponding set of missions which the products are designed to fulfil”.Ansoff, I.: Strategies for Diversification, Harvard Business Review, Vol. 35 Issue 5,Sep-Oct 1957, pp. 113-124 He describes four growth alternatives for growing an organization in existing or new markets, with existing or new products. Each alternative poses differing levels of risk for an organization: =Market penetration= In market penetration strategy, the organization tries to grow using its existing offerings (products and services) in existing markets. In other words, it tries to increase its market share in current market scenario. This involves increasing market share within existing market segments. This can be achieved by selling more products or services to established customers or by finding new customers within existing markets. Here, the company seeks increased sales for its present products in its present markets through more aggressive promotion and distribution. This can be accomplished by: * Price decrease * Increase in promotion and distribution support * Acquisition of a rival in the same market * Modest product refinements This is the least risky growth option. =Market development= In market development strategy, a firm tries to expand into new markets (geographies, countries etc.) using its existing offerings and also, with minimal product/services development. This can be accomplished by: * Different customer segments * Industrial buyers for a good that was previously sold only to the households; * New areas or regions of the country * Foreign markets. This strategy is more likely to be successful where: * The firm has a unique product technology it can leverage in the new market * It benefits from economies of scale if it increases output * The new market is not too different from the one it has experience of * The buyers in the market are intrinsically profitable. This additional quadrant move increases uncertainty and thus increases the risk further. =Product development= In product development strategy, a company tries to create new products and services targeted at its existing markets to achieve growth. This involves extending the product range available to the firm's existing markets. These products may be obtained by: * Investment in research and development of additional products; * Acquisition of rights to produce someone else's product; * Buying in the product and “badging” it as one’s own brand; * Joint development with ownership of another company who need access to the firm's distribution channels or brands. This also consists of one quadrant move so is riskier than Market penetration and a similar risk as Market development. =Diversification= In diversification an organization tries to grow its market share by introducing new offerings in new markets. It is the most risky strategy because both product and market development is required. Related Diversification— there is relationship and, therefore, potential synergy, between the firms in existing business and the new product/market space. Unrelated Diversification: This is otherwise termed conglomerate growth because the resulting corporation is a conglomerate, i.e. a collection of businesses without any relationship to one another. A strategy for company growth by starting up or acquiring businesses outside the company’s current products and markets. Diversification consists of two quadrant moves so is deemed the riskiest growth option.  Uses  The Ansoff Matrix is a useful tool for organizations wanting to identify and explore their growth options. Although the risk varies between quadrants, with Diversification being the riskiest, it can be argued that if an organization diversifies its offering successfully into multiple unrelated markets then, in fact, its overall risk portfolio is lowered.  Criticisms  = Isolation challenges = Used by itself, the Ansoff matrix could be misleading. It does not take into account the activities of competitors and the ability for competitors to counter moves into other industries. It also fails to consider the challenges and risks of changes to business-as-usual activities. An organization hoping to move into new markets or create new products (or both) must consider whether they possess transferable skills, flexible structures, and agreeable stakeholders. = Logical consistency challenges = The logic of the Ansoff matrix has been questioned. The logical issues pertain to interpretations about newness. If one assumes a new product really is new to the firm, in many cases a new product will simultaneously take the firm into a new, unfamiliar market. In that case, one of the Ansoff quadrants, diversification, is redundant. Alternatively, if a new product does not necessarily take the firm into a new market, then the combination of new products into new markets does not always equate to diversification, in the sense of venturing into a completely unknown business.

It is published in Bulawayo and mostly reports on news in the Matebeleland region in the southern part of the country. It is state-owned and therefore usually only publishes news that supports the government and its policies. It also covers stories on national and international news, as well as entertainment, sport, business, travel, job offers and real estate. It was established in 1894 and it was the largest newspaper in the country following The Herald. History The Chronicle is one of the oldest newspapers in Africa. The Chronicle was founded by the Argus Company of South Africa on 12 October 1894. The media in Rhodesia catered mostly to the white settlers needs, ignoring the news of interest to native Africans. Like most newspapers, The Chronicle covered politics, sports and current affairs, however news about the continent of Africa was ignored. News about the African population was seldom published, unless the news regarded crimes committed by Africans. When articles concerned Africans, the stories were typically negative and demeaning. By the time Independence was attained in 1980, the media coverage in Zimbabwe had changed little. News coverage was still prone to a settler-bias as the most prominent Rhodesian printing and publishing executives in Rhodesia themselves were white. The editors, as well as most of the reporting staff, were also white too. The development of the Zimbabwe Press can be categorised into three eras. Prior to 1980, the era was considered the Colonial or Nationalist era. From 1980–1990 the media was in the Transitional Era. Media originating after 1990 is considered to be from the Post-Transitional era. During each era the political and ideological status of the country would reflect what kind of news would be published and how it would be published. The last white editor in Zimpapers was Jean Maitland-Stuart. In 1983 Tommy Sithole became the first black editor of the Chronicle.  Willowgate  In 1988, The Chronicle's editor was Geoffrey Nyarota. The paper built a reputation for aggressive investigations into corruption at all levels of government, and Nyarota became \\"something of a hero\\". In the \\"Willowgate\\" investigation, Nyarota and deputy editor Davison Maruziva reported that ministers and officials from the government of President Robert Mugabe had been given early access to buy foreign cars at an assembly plant in Willowvale, an industrial suburb of Harare. In some cases, the cars were bought wholesale and resold at a 200% profit. The newspaper published documents from the plant to prove its case, including identification numbers from the vehicles. Mugabe appointed a three-person panel, the Sandura Commission, to investigate the allegations. The Washington Post reported that the commission's hearings \\"struck a deep chord\\" in Zimbabwe, where citizens had grown to resent the perceived growing corruption of government. Five of Mugabe's cabinet ministers eventually resigned due to implication in the scandal, including Defense Minister Enos Nkala and Maurice Nyagumbo, the third highest-ranking official in Mugabe's party, the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU). However, Nyartora and Maruziva were both forced out of their jobs and into newly created public relations positions in Harare. Though the men were given pay raises, Mugabe also stated that the move was a result of their \\"overzealousness\\", leading to public belief that they had been removed for their reporting. ZANU parliamentarians also criticised Nyarota and Maruziva, with the Minister of State for National Security stating that criticism was welcome, but \\"to the extent that the press now deliberately target Government as their enemy, then we part ways.\\" 2000s The Chronicle was commonly considered a monopoly newspaper of Bulawayo after the printing of The Daily News was banned in 2003 due to its critical reporting of Mugabe's government. In 2009, The Chronicle fired its editor, Stephen Ndlovu following an exposé on followers of the Minister of Information Jonathan Moyo. Also in 2009, the subsequent editor of The Chronicle, Brezhnev Malaba, was charged with libel in a story which concerning police corruption. Nduduzo Tshuma, a staff reporter at the newspaper, was also charged with libel, following the publication of an article alleging that members of the police were involved in a Grain Marketing Board Maize Scandal.

It was believed to have been settled about 1000 BCE, and archaeological finds include silver coins, iron axes, lances, bows and arrows. At that time, the village was a commercial center. During the eighth century CE, it was a river port where Muslims traded with Rome and Persia. In 1338 Fakhruddin Mubarak Shah took control of the region, followed by Firuz Shah Tughlaq. In 1577, Isa Khan proclaimed independence for Egarosindur as a trading center. At this time a battle took place at the Fort of Egarosindur between Isa Khan and Man Singh I, Akbar's general, in which Isa Khan was defeated.

Family tree of Tekur SubramanyamShri Lal Bahadur Shastri Letter Tekur Subramanyam Tekur Subramanyam bringing Urn containing ashes of Gandhi ji from Delhi in 1948 When the country attained independence on 15 August 1947 the then Madras Government authorized Tekur to hoist National flag at Sambamoorhy maidan in Ballari at the stroke of midnight amidst intense jubilation. Tekur used to tell that he may not witness country attaining independence during his life time. Tekur brought Urn containing ashes of Gandhiji after his assassination in 1948 for immersion at Hampi in sacred Tunga Bhadra River. After independence Tekur was elected to Lok Sabha from Ballari three times- in 1952, 1957 and in 1962 thus for 15 years he represented Ballari in the Lok Sabha. He was a distinguished Parliamentarian and used to actively participate in debates after dong lot of home work. He was regular like a student in attending sessions. He endeared himself with all the members of Parliament cutting across party lines. He became Secretary of Congress Party in Parliament in 1956 and also became political secretary to PM Nehru. Letter from Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh Tekur always preferred stability in administration; he never aligned with any groups. In 1960 there were attempts to destabilize BD Jatti ministry in Mysore state. He approached Nehru who was then PM to prevent this crisis. Nehru immediately took appropriate action that saved Jatti Ministry. He also endorsed Tekur’ views he wrote ”I entirely agree with you that frequent attempts to upset the Congress ministries are not desirable unless some basic principles are involved.” Tekur was in favor of interlinking of major rivers in the country. When his close friend Lal Bahadur Sastri became PM in 1965 Tekur was invited to join Union Cabinet as Minister. Tekur profusely thanked Sastri and politely declined the offer. Tekur was instrumental in getting Ballari merged in to erstwhile Mysore State (now Karnataka) in 1953. He along with other state leaders including Nijalingappa, Hallikeri Gudlappa, RR Diwakar, Karnad Sadashiva Rao and others fought for unification of Karnataka state that finally became a reality in 1956. He strongly pleaded for establishing a steel plant in public sector in Ballari-Hospet region. He also wanted laying of Broad gauge line in place of meter gauge for transporting ore to Madras and Bombay/Karwar ports and introduction of direct trains between Bombay and Madras via Ballari. He also pleaded for electrification Guntakal- Hubli line via Ballari Tekur inducted M.Y. Ghorpade in to active politics in 1957. M.Y.

Former President Venkataraman in a message said “Quiet and unostentatious by disposition, Tekur was a model legislator, he spoke briefly and effectively. He was respected by all the members of the Lok Sabha. Tekur ‘s life serves as a role model for succeeding generations of public and political workers”. Mr.C.Subrmaniam another close associate of Tekur –former Union Agriculture Minister and former Governor of Maharastra says “I had the pleasure of knowing him when I was in Madras and later in Lok Sabha between 1962–1967 as MP. Tekur ‘s life is a shining example of how a politician should function. It would be appropriate for his life to be projected for the younger generation to follow”. Former Prime Minister Dr.Manmohan Singh in a message to Dr.Tekur Ramanath (Tekur’son) says “Shri. Tekur Sunrhmanyam was a prominent leader of our country who was a freedom fighter and eminent parliamentarian. His life and works will continue to inspire generations of Indian people in years to come.” Mr.MY Ghorpade former Minister and for whom Tekur was his political Guru and mentor mentions “Tekur was a gentle soul who radiated goodness and goodwill towards all. He was a true Gandhian. to him freedom was not just political but freedom from all kinds of deprivations and disparities. He recognized divinity in all human beings.

Biography Alexander Winterberger was born in 1834. He studied at Weimar with the Weimar Municipal Organist Johann Gottlob Töpfer (1791-1870).Ben Arnold, The Liszt CompanionFranz Liszt and Agnes Street-Klindworth Although he also studied under Franz Liszt until 1853, he was in the 'outer circle' of students, that is, not among those with whom Liszt spent most time and was on most intimate personal terms.Alan Walker, Franz Liszt: The final years 1861-1886 He displayed a mastery of novel registrations, which in some cases Liszt and he worked out together. Winterberger had been a classmate of Julius Reubke in Berlin, and he was instrumental in Reubke deciding to come to Weimar to study with Liszt.arsisaudio In 1855 Liszt inspected the construction of the new organ at Merseburg Cathedral, and resolved to write (some sources say he was commissioned by Winterberger) a grand piece for the official opening: his Fantasy and Fugue on the Theme B-A-C-H.

CV dazzle combines stylized makeup, asymmetric hair, and sometimes infrared lights built in to glasses or clothing to break up detectable facial patterns recognized by computer vision algorithms in much the same way that warships contrasted color and used sloping lines and curves to distort the structure of a vessel. It has been shown to be somewhat successful at defeating face detection software in common use, including that employed by Facebook. CV dazzle attempts to block detection by facial recognition technologies such as DeepFace \\"by creating an 'anti-face'\\". It uses occlusion, covering certain facial features; transformation, altering the shape or colour of parts of the face; and a combination of the two.

It is named after Belweder, the Polish presidential palace in Warsaw, whose illustration appears on its bottles. It is produced in Żyrardów, Poland. The brand was launched in the United States in 1996 as a \\"luxury\\" liquor and is marketed as the world's first super premium vodka. Since entering the U.S. market Belvedere has partnered with a number of celebrities including Chelsea Handler, Usher and John Legend. In 2015, the brand was chosen as the official vodka of the 24th James Bond film, Spectre. History The distillery that produces Belvedere was constructed in 1910. Production began in 1993 at the facility located at Polmos Żyrardów, Poland. In 2002, 40% of Millennium was acquired by the luxury goods group LVMH and in April 2005 this stake was raised to 100%. The brand was endorsed by Chelsea Handler and sponsored her Chelsea Chelsea Bang Bang comedy tour based on her book of the same name in 2010. In 2011, Belvedere Vodka began a partnership with Product Red featuring R&B; singer Usher to release a limited edition, specially branded bottle and donating up to 50% of the profits to the Global Fund, which fights HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. As part of Belvedere's ongoing partnership with Product Red, John Legend was featured in the brand's 2016 campaign to donate to the Global Fund which included limited edition bottles designed by Esther Mahlangu. In 2015, Belvedere Vodka was chosen to be the official vodka brand of the 24th James Bond film, Spectre. Belvedere was named the Vodka Producer of the Year for the third consecutive year at the International Spirits Challenge in July 2017. In September 2017, the Belvedere announced it would cease production on its 'Unfiltered' version of its vodka and release the Single Estate Rye series. In 2018, Belvedere partnered with singer-songwriter and actress Janelle Monáe to produce a series of short films. Production process A bottle of Belvedere at a bar at Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas In order for Belvedere Vodka to be labeled as a super premium Polska Wódka (Polish Vodka), the vodka must be produced using specific Polish grains or potatoes and Polish water. The official labeling of Polish Vodka also requires that no artificial additives be added to vodkas. As such, Belvedere Vodka uses varieties of Dankowskie rye harvested from one of seven nearby farms in its \\"luxury\\" vodka. To produce the vodka, the rye is harvested and simmered to form a mash which is then fermented and distilled at an agricultural distillery before undergoing distillation three additional times at the Belvedere distillery. =Flavors= Belvedere also produces flavored vodkas which are produced using a maceration process. The brand's flavored variants are produced by combining pure spirit with a macerated fruit, which is then distilled at a low temperature to form a macerate concentrate. The concentrated mixture is blended with the distillery's artesian well water to bottling strength and bottled. These flavors are not charcoal filtered, and are filtered through cellulose particle filters prior to bottling. This is done with the intention of ensuring essential oils that carry fruit flavors and give mouth feel are retained. The Belvedere Maceration product line includes Mango Passion, Lemon Tea, Bloody Mary, Pink Grapefruit, Black Raspberry, Orange, Citrus and Ginger Zest. Criticism On March 23, 2012, Belvedere Vodka's Twitter and Facebook pages posted a branded image that was attacked for seemingly making light of rape. The image featured a man playfully restraining a woman who appeared to be trying to flee, and the slogan, \\"Unlike Some People, Belvedere Always Goes Down Smoothly.\\" The image was published on the social media sites for roughly 45 minutes before being pulled. Belvedere's President, Charles Gibb, issued a formal apology for the incident. The ad used a still image from an unrelated video starring Alicyn Packard. Packard did not give permission, and filed a lawsuit against LVMH for violating her publicity rights as an actor. The parties settled for an undisclosed sum after mediation and the action was dismissed on 21 June 2012. In an analysis mandated by Swiss TV RTS in May 2014, the Eurofins Scientific group of laboratories revealed the presence of sugar cane or corn while Belvedere's labeling mentions rye alcohol only.http://www.rts.ch/emissions/abe/test/5827880-la-vodka-le-test.html References External links * Polish vodkas Polish brands LVMH brands Luxury brands Rye-based drinks Products introduced in 1993 ","title":"Belvedere Vodka"},{"id":"31486728","text":"Pipiza austriaca is a species of hoverfly, from the family Syrphidae, in the order Diptera.

The MP was the son of Sir John Carter (before 20 December 1741 – 18 May 1808, Mayor of Portsmouth, and son of John Carter, who was a merchant). He assumed the name Bonham by Royal Licence when he inherited the estates of his cousin Thomas Bonham. Joanna Maria Smith was the daughter of William Smith, the abolitionist MP; her sister Frances was the mother of Florence Nightingale, and her brother Benjamin was the father of Barbara Bodichon and Benjamin Leigh Smith. Most of the Bonham-Carters and their circle belonged to Unitarian churches. John and Joanna had a daughter, (Joanna) Hilary Bonham-Carter (d. 1865), who was an artist and friend of political journalist Harriet Martineau. Hilary's portraits of her cousin Florence Nightingale are held in the National Portrait Gallery. Another member of the family was John Bonham-Carter, MP (1817–1884), a son of the elder John Bonham-Carter, MP. This John Bonham- Carter briefly served as a Lord of the Treasury in 1866. His third son by his second wife, The Hon. Mary Baring (a daughter of The 1st Baron Northbrook), was Arthur Thomas Bonham-Carter, KC (1869–1916), who was educated at Winchester College and Trinity College, Cambridge. A.T. Bonham-Carter was a soldier and barrister, eventually serving as a Justice of the bench of His Majesty's High Court of East Africa, which was based in Mombasa. Justice Bonham-Carter was still a judge on the bench of this court when the First World War broke out in 1914. He later resigned from the colonial bench in British East Africa and joined, as an officer, The 1st Battalion, The Hampshire Regiment, eventually being promoted to the rank of captain. He was killed serving with this regiment on the first day of the Battle of the Somme, 1 July 1916, and was later buried in Serre Road Military Cemetery No. 2, near Beaumont-Hamel in northern France. Captain Bonham-Carter's name appears on the war memorial at the Muthaiga Country Club in Nairobi. The Bonham Carter family, as descended from Sir Maurice Bonham Carter and The Baroness Asquith of Yarnbury, is the only example so far where three generations have received Life Peerages under the 1958 Life Peerages Act:The titles of the three judges Baron Russell of Killowen were created under the Appellate Jurisdiction Act of 1876. Violet, Baroness Asquith of Yarnbury; her son, Mark Raymond Bonham Carter; and her granddaughter, Jane Bonham Carter, were all separately made life peers of Yarnbury in the County of Wiltshire.

Señor Discretion Himself ran April 9-May 23, 2004 at Arena Stage in Washington, D.C. The production was directed by Charles Randolph-Wright, choreography by Doriana Sanchez, music direction and vocal arrangements by Brian Cimmet, orchestrations by Larry Hochman. The production starred Shawn Elliott, Elena Shaddow, Ivan Hernandez, Margo Reymundo, and John Bolton. Background Frank Loesser worked on what would have been his final musical from 1965-1968. Suffering from terminal illness, he ultimately wrote to Budd Schulberg, claiming to have abandoned work on Señor Discretion Himself. In the 1980s, a developmental workshop was done of the show, for which new arrangements of the music were devised. The libretto was completed by Schulberg, but after the unsuccessful 1985 workshop, the show disappeared back into obscurity. In 2003, a reading and subsequent workshop were put together in preparation for the 2004 production at Arena Stage. In 2005, another reading and a demo recording were created. 2004 Arena stage production (world premiere) The workshop The cast from the world premiere: *Pancito - Shawn Elliott *Hilario - John Bolton *Lupita - Elena Shaddow *Martin - Ivan Hernandez *Carolina - Margo Reymundo *Father Orlando - Robert Almodovar *Father Francisco - Tony Chiroldes *Father Manuel - Carlos Lopez *Ensemble - Venny Carranza, Steven Cupo, Rayanne Gonzales, Deanna Harris, Laura-Lisa, Lynnette Marrero, Eduardo Placer and Diego Prieto Awards and nominations *2005 Helen Hayes Award – Outstanding Resident Musical *2005 Helen Hayes Nomination – Emilio Sosa, Costume Design (Resident Design)  References   External links  * frankloesser.com * Variety review * Talkin' Broadway review 2004 musicals Musicals based on short fiction ","title":"Señor Discretion Himself"},{"id":"31486803","text":"Location of Cyprus Lepidoptera of Cyprus consist of both the butterflies and moths recorded from Cyprus.

In 1969, he became one of the inaugural inductees into the Franklin & Marshall College Athletics Hall of Fame. Early years Herman was born in Gordonville, Pennsylvania in 1891 and raised in Leacock Township, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. He was the son of Pennsylvania natives, J. Peter Herman and Hanna F. Herman. His father was a farmer and, later, a merchant dealing in coal and lumber. He had two older brothers, Samuel S. Herman and J. Leon Herman, and a younger brother John F.

Playing career Herman was a halfback and punter for the Franklin & Marshall Nevonians (now called the \\"Diplomats\\") located in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Herman played for the program from 1913 through the 1916 seasons. Herman first drew notice as a substitute in 1913, scoring two touchdowns in a victory over Franklin & Marshall's rival, Gettysburg College. Although Franklin & Marshall's football team today plays in the NCAA's Division III, the Nevonians played at the highest level during the 1910s. In 1914, the Franklin & Marshall football team, with Herman playing halfback, compiled a 6–2 record and defeated Penn, at the time considered one of the \\"Big Four\\" of college football, by a score of 10–0. In 1915, the team again compiled a 6–2 record and outscored opponents by cumulative score of 188 to 43. With Herman playing fullback, Franklin & Marshall lost to Penn by a score of 10–6 in 1915, but the Boston Globe praised the effort of the Franklin & Marshall squad: \\"The University of Pennsylvania football team in its third game of the season beat Franklin and Marshall today, 10 to 6, in one of the best battles seen here in years. Much praise is due the visitors from Lancaster, for during the entire game they fought with a snap and vim that at times had the Red and Blue eleven bewildered.\\" Herman was also a member and the captain of the varsity baseball team at Franklin & Marshall where he was \\"recognized as one of the best college players on the diamond.\\" In 1916, he also played baseball for the Hanover in the Blue Ridge League. One newspaper summarized Herman's contributions while playing for Hanover as follows > Herman is one of the fastest second basemen that has ever played on Nixon > Field. His fielding is as nearly perfect as can be found in teams of the > Blue Ridge class, he is a strong batter, and his base running has frequently > been a subject for comment. Coupled with these is his field generalship. He > is constantly on the job and not a thing escapes his watchful eye ... With > all Herman's scrappiness on the field his conduct has never been of the > offensive sort and umpires and fans as well as members of the opposing teams > have enjoyed his attention to the conduct of the game. Upon his graduation from Franklin & Marshall in 1916, a bidding war developed for Herman's services as a professional baseball player. He ultimately signed to play professional baseball for the Gettysburg Ponies in the Blue Ridge League. He was the captain and starting second baseman for the 1916 Ponies team. (identifying Art Herman as the team captain) He maintained a .266 batting average in 93 games and 327 at bats for Gettysburg. Coaching career The next year, Herman was named the head football coach for his alma mater, Franklin & Marshall. He held that position for the 1917 season, compiling a record of 2–6. He left his coaching duties when called to active duty military for World War I. Before leaving for active duty, Herman is credited with helping to sustain the football program at Franklin and Marshall during the war when many of the team's players were directed to military action. Later years In a draft registration card completed by Herman in June 1917, Herman indicated that he was employed as the postmaster at Gordonville, which is located approximately 20 miles east of the Franklin and Marshall campus in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania.Draft Registration Card for Arthur Slaymaker Herman, born Nov. 29, 1891.

They include three national parks, and five Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty. National parks Llyn y Fan Fach in the Brecon Beacons, one of Wales' three national parks Wales is home to three national parks. Snowdonia National Park () was established in 1951 as the third National Park in Britain, following the Peak District and the Lake District. It covers , and has of coastline. Pembrokeshire Coast National Park () is a national park along the Pembrokeshire coast in West Wales. It was established as a National Park in 1952, and is the only one in the United Kingdom to have been designated primarily because of its spectacular coastline. It covers an area of . Brecon Beacons National Park (), founded in 1957, stretching from Llandeilo in the west to Hay-on-Wye in the east, covering and encompassing four main regions – the Black Mountain in the west, Fforest Fawr and the Brecon Beacons in the centre, and the Black Mountains in the east. Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty Three Cliffs Bay and Tor Bay on the Gower Peninsula, the first Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty to be designated in the United Kingdom Five areas of outstanding natural beauty (AONB) have been designated in Wales, one of which, the Wye Valley AONB, straddles the Anglo-Welsh border. The Gower () is a peninsula on the south west coast of Wales, on the north side of the Bristol Channel in the southwest of the historic county of Glamorgan. Referred to colloquially as 'the Gower', this was the first area in the United Kingdom to be designated as an AONB, in 1956, and covers . Llŷn ( or ) is a peninsula which extends into the Irish Sea from north west Wales, south west of the Isle of Anglesey. Much of the coastline and the ex-volcanic hills are part of the Llŷn AONB, confirming the peninsula as one of the most scientifically important in both Wales and Britain. The AONB was created in 1956, and covers . Anglesey () was designated an AONB in 1966, in order to protect the aesthetic appeal and variety of the island's coastal landscape and habitats from inappropriate development. The AONB covers most of Anglesey’s coastline, as well as inland areas, such as Holyhead Mountain and Mynydd Bodafon. The AONB covers around , about a third of the county, making it Wales' largest AONB. The Wye Valley AONB, designated in 1971, is an internationally important protected landscape straddling the border between England and Wales. It is one of the most dramatic and scenic landscape areas in southern Britain. The River Wye () is the fifth-longest river in the United Kingdom. The upper part of the river passes through the settlements of Rhayader, Builth Wells and Hay-on-Wye, but the area designated as an AONB surrounds only the 58-mile stretch lower down the river, from just south of the city of Hereford to Chepstow. The Clwydian Range and Dee Valley () is a series of hills and mountains in north east Wales that runs from Llandegla in the south to Prestatyn in the north, with the highest point being the popular Moel Famau. It was designated as an AONB in 1985. The Clwydian Range AONB was extended in 2011 to include the hills around Llangollen, including the Eglwyseg escarpment and Llantysilio Mountain, and is in extent. Heritage Coast Marloes Peninsula Heritage Coast, seen from the Pembrokeshire Coast Path There are fourteen heritage coasts in Wales. They are \\"stretches of outstanding, undeveloped coast in England and Wales\\", which are not protected by law (except where covered by other protected areas), but are given special consideration by planning authorities.

SSSIs are the basic building block of site-based nature conservation legislation and most other legal nature/geological conservation designations in Great Britain are based upon them, including national nature reserves, Ramsar sites, Special Protection Areas, and Special Areas of Conservation. Sites notified for their biological interest are known as Biological SSSIs, and those notified for geological or physiographic interest are Geological SSSIs. Many SSSIs are notified for both biological and geological interest. ;Lists of SSSIs: *Brecknock *Carmarthen & Dinefwr *Ceredigion *Clwyd *East Gwynedd *Gwent *Mid & South Glamorgan *Montgomery *Preseli & South Pembrokeshire *Radnor *West Glamorgan *West Gwynedd Special Areas of Conservation Borth Bog () is a Special Area of Conservation near Borth, Ceredigion. A Special Area of Conservation (SAC) is defined in the European Union's Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC), also known as the Directive on the Conservation of Natural Habitats and of Wild Fauna and Flora. They are to protect the 220 habitats and approximately 1000 species listed in annex I and II of the directive which are considered to be of European interest following criteria given in the directive. They must be chosen from the Sites of Community Importance by the State Members and designated SAC by an act assuring the conservation measures of the natural habitat. Special Protection Areas A Special Protection Area (SPA) is a designation under the European Union Directive on the Conservation of Wild Birds. Under the Directive, Member States of the European Union (EU) have a duty to safeguard the habitats of migratory birds and certain particularly threatened birds. Together with Special Areas of Conservation (SACs), the SPAs form a network of protected sites across the EU, called Natura 2000. Each SPA has an EU code – for example the Burry Inlet SPA has the code UK9015011. Scheduled ancient monuments Valle Crucis Abbey is one of a number of Scheduled Monuments maintained by Cadw. Scheduled monuments in Wales are in the care of Cadw, the historic environment service of the Welsh Government. Local nature reserves Local nature reserves (LNR) have their origin in the recommendations of the Wild Life Conservation Special Committee (Conservation of Nature in England and Wales, Command 7122, 1947) which established the framework for nature conservation in the United Kingdom and suggested a national suite of protected areas comprising national nature reserves, conservation areas (which incorporated suggestions for Sites of Special Scientific Interest), national parks, Geological Monuments, local nature reserves and local educational nature reserves.

He competed using a monoski – a specially fitted chair over a single ski that includes seat belts and other strapping, as well as a suspension device to minimise wear and tear on the skier's body. Skiing career In his first competitive event after his accident, The 1990 World Disabled Ski Championships, Stockford won a gold medal in the downhill and bronze in the slalom. =Paralympics= Stockford first competed at the Winter Paralympics during the 1992 Games held in Tignes and Albertville, France. He took part in four alpine skiing events, downhill, giant slalom, super-G and slalom, in the LW10 classification for athletes who race sitting down. He won three bronze medals in the downhill, super-G and giant slalom events. After Stockford won the bronze in downhill, the British delegation filed a protest claiming that the two American skiers ahead of him should not have been in the LW10 category. The medical committee rejected the protest on the grounds that all classifications had been determined at the start of the competition. In the slalom Stockford finished fourth, missing out on a medal by one position and 10.65 seconds. At the 1994 Winter Paralympics in Lillehammer, Norway, Stockford again competed in downhill, giant slalom, super-G and slalom events in a classification now renamed as LWX. He failed to finish in the downhill slalom or giant slalom but picked up his fourth Paralympic bronze medal in the super-G. Since this bronze, and the four others won by British athletes in Lillehammer, Britain has failed to win any Paralympic alpine skiing medals. Stockford now runs a successful property business in London. In 2006 Stockford became the manager of British Olympic skier Chemmy Alcott after meeting her sister-in-law's father at a party. He helped Alcott set up a team of support staff and raise funding from private sources with the aim of winning a medal at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver.

Randolph served as secretary of the dominion. While in that position, he argued for tighter Crown control over proprietary and charter colonies whose administrations lacked such oversight, and he was often given the difficult task of enforcing England's Navigation Acts in whichever colony he was posted to, often against significant local popular and political resistance. His actions were a significant contribution to the development of Great Britain's colonial administrative infrastructure, but he remained unpopular in the dominion. During the 1689 Boston revolt, which deposed Andros and overthrew the dominion, he was jailed. In 1691, he was appointed surveyor general of the customs in the American mainland as well as some of the island colonies, and a year later received an additional appointment as deputy auditor of Maryland.Osgood, Herbert Levi.

Family Born Charlotte Arbaleste, in Paris, France, on February 1, 1550, she had three brothers and a sister. Her father was Guy Arbaleste II, Viscount of Melun, Lord of la Borde in 1552. In 1555 he became president of the Paris Chamber of Accounts. He joined the Protestant religion in 1569 and died the following year. Charlotte's mother was a devout Catholic until the day she died in 1590. Life She was born into a well-to-do French family many years before the civil war between the French Catholics and Protestants. During the religious wars in France, her father left the Catholic Church for the Protestant Church, while her mother remained a devout Catholic. Her siblings were divided between Catholic and Protestant, but Charlotte herself left the Catholic Church and remained a devout Protestant. At the age of 17, Charlotte married her first husband, Jean de Pas, the lord of Feuqueres. Jean de Pas was also a converted Protestant, but he had served at the court of Catholic Valois kings in the past. Once they were married, Charlotte was sent by her husband to Sedan, where their daughter was born. Jean died five months later, never meeting his daughter. Charlotte became a Huguenot as an adult and was known for writing a first-person account of the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre (1572). After being caught up in the massacre she left her daughter in the custody of her Catholic mother and fled to Sedan for safety. In 1576, after she gained notoriety for writing those accounts, she met Philippe de Mornay (1549-1623), a writer who would later become her second husband. Marriage to Mornay The widowed Charlotte did not wish to remarry, but she met and was attracted to the intelligence of Philippe de Mornay, lord of Plessis-Marly, a Huguenot fighter in the religious wars of the Protestant Reformation and a leading French Protestant. In 1576, at age 26, with an eight-year-old daughter from her first marriage, she married Philippe (age 27), who was also a writer and who had escaped the St. Bartholomew massacre as well. He continued to be a soldier but soon became adviser to then-Huguenot King Henry of Navarre, who wanted the French throne. Philippe was a well- respected soldier and author and was called the Pope of the Huguenots. In marrying Philippe de Mornay, Charlotte’s life course changed dramatically; she was now set on traveling with her husband as much as she could. She desired to enable her husband the freedom to write. She moved her family to London, Flanders, Gascony and Saumur as her husband moved. During their travels, Charlotte and Philippe befriended many prominent Protestants such as Francis Walsingham, Mary Sidney and Philip Sidney. Charlotte and Philippe had eight children together; however, only three lived past infancy. While her husband was building his career she aided him by entertaining people who came to see him: military men, courtiers, and other writers. She dedicated her life to Philippe; as a fellow Huguenot she decided it was her duty to ensure he had the time to write and convert people to become involved in the Huguenot cause. Work Charlotte Duplessis-Mornay first gained notoriety as a writer when she wrote a first-person account of the St. Bartholomew’s Day massacre. Charlotte was an avid letter writer but was best known for the Memories de Messier de Philippe de Mornay, which she wrote for her husband. The Memories de Messier de Philippe de Mornay were first published in 1824 and are now in the Sorbonne Library. She began writing the memoir in 1584, and in 1595, she gave the writing that she had so far written to her 16-year-old son because it was her wish that he would carry on the work and alliances of the Protestant cause, a cause that his mother and father began. With failing health and vision she continued to write the memoir for ten years. During that time, she kept a record of all of her husband's writings, declarations, and political activities. When she received the tragic news of the death of her son Philippe, who was killed fighting with the army of Prince Maurice at Gueldres on October 23, 1605, Charlotte gave up her Memoires, which she had been writing for him alone. She put down her pen on April 21, 1606. Death Charlotte Duplessis-Mornay died in 1606, one year after the death of her only son, after a long period of illness, exhaustion, sorrow, and near blindness. She died on May 15, 1606 of the same year she quit writing. Not long after her husband’s death, in 1623, Memoires de Messier Philippe de Mornay was published. The accounts in the memoir are about her husband, but the writing gives insight to what a great writer Charlotte was. Her husband, Philippe, wrote an account of her death, in which he claimed that she continued to affirm her Protestant faith until the day she died.

Taxonomy The ants of the Neotropical genus Monacis were revised in 1959 by Kempf. However, Brown in 1973 and G. C. Wheeler and J. Wheeler in 1973 and 1976 considered both Monacis and Hypoclinea to be junior synonyms of Dolichoderus.Notes on the ant genus Hypoclinea, Mayr, with descriptions of three new species Description The type species is Dolichoderus attelaboides. Worker ants in this genus have a body length that is typically about four millimetres and can be recognised by their thick, inflexible and strongly sculptured integument. There is a flange on the underside of the head near the base of the mandibles which is saw-like in some species. The longitudinal suture in the central plate of the metathorax is deeply impressed. The propodeum or first abdominal segment has the posterior face distinctly concave when viewed from the side.Online Catalog of the North American Ants The gaster and alitrunk are separated by a single segment, the petiole. The orifice of the cloaca is a horizontal slit rather than a circular opening. It is surrounded by a few rather stiff erect bristles.Identification and nesting sites of North American species of Dolichoderus Distribution Members of this genus are found worldwide, in all the continents except Antarctica. Biology Colonies are of varying sizes and are constructed in the soil, in curled leaves, in the hollow stems of plants and in cartons which are formed by the ants chewing wood and mixing the product with secretions in a similar way to that used by wasps to build their nests. Some species are very versatile with Dolichoderus pustulatus nesting underground in northern parts of the United States while living wholly in trees in the south. The workers seek out and tend sap-sucking insects such as aphids and scale insects that excrete honeydew and they also feed on small arthropods. Some species emit a pungent smelling fluid. Two species, Dolichoderus plagiatus and Dolichoderus taschenbergi, are believed to be polygynous with several queens in one nest. It is also possible that D. taschenbergi may be a temporary social parasite with D. plagiatus as host.

Steer served in the army during World War I, briefly emigrated to Canada, then returned to England and worked with type-founders Stephenson Blake before moving to Spottiswoode Ballantyne [& Co.] In 1928, Steer, with six other like-minded friends, met in a Sicilian restaurant in Holborn and founded the British Typographers' Guild (BTG) with the original purpose \\"to bring together in friendship and mutual help, all those with a love of the printed word\\". He served as the first President of the guild, and was re-elected to serve as president for its second year. He retired from the guild in 1945. In 1934, Steer wrote Printing Design and Layout with a foreword by Beatrice Warde. This book was referred to as \\"A Complete Course in Typography\\", received praise from Francis Meynell, and was known as the \\"Typographer's Bible\\". Three subsequent editions were published: the second in 1945 (and reprinted 1947); the third in 1952; the fourth and final in 1958 (and reprinted in 1960). In total, 18,000 copies were sold.  Vincent Steer Award  The International Society of Typographic Designers, which evolved from the guild that Steer founded, has an annual Student Assessment Scheme whose single most outstanding submission is awarded the Vincent Steer Award, named in his honour.

It is based in Manchester in northern England, and has offshoots in London and Jakarta. History =Commercial studio= Spirit Studios, based on Tariff Street in Manchester, began as a commercial recording studio in 1980 as part of the well-known Northern Quarter or creative quarter as known by some. John Breakell, Spirit Studios’ founder and Managing Director, ran the business with facilities that included 4 small rehearsal rooms and a single 4-track recording studio. The first band to use Spirit's facilities were The Smiths, named by NME magazine as the most influential band since 1952. Spirit Studios continued to provide rehearsal and recording space for many Mancunian bands and international artists, notably: The Stone Roses, Tony Wilson, Simply Red, Happy Mondays and 808 State, Hypnotone, 2 for Joy, and Illustration Creator \\"歩き目です(Arukimedesu)\\". Producers such as Trevor Horn (Frankie Goes to Hollywood, Seal etc.), Martin Hannet (The Stone Roses, Joy Division etc.) and Arthur Baker (Bruce Springsteen, Bob Dylan, Kraftwerk, Al Green) all visited Spirit to record and produce their work. =Educational facility= In 1984, Spirit Studios made the transition from commercial recording studio to an educational facility to become the School of Sound Recording (SSR). SSR was the first dedicated Audio Engineering School in the UK, harvesting the advice and assistance of producers who had previously recorded at Spirit Studios. At this time SSR occupied half of the basement of 10 Tariff Street, and the entire facility consisted of a single studio, one classroom and a reception/office area. SSR grew steadily during its first 15 years of trading and by 2000 the school occupied all 3 floors of 10 Tariff Street, two floors of 12 Tariff Street and a single floor in Fourways House (also on Tariff Street). By this time the school housed 8 studios, 2 computer suites, 4 DJ booths, a classroom and had become Europe’s first AVID (then Digidesign) “Pro School” in May 2002. However, with student numbers still increasing it was clear that relocation was needed. In 2004, the Tariff Street campus closed its doors for the final time allowing the launch of SSR’s current location on Downing Street, Manchester. The newly formed School of Sound Recording is located around 0.5 miles south of Manchester’s city centre. Friday 5 June 2009 saw the Lord Mayor of Manchester and MP for Manchester Central Tony Lloyd officially re-launch a brand new Spirit Studio on the fourth floor of SSR’s Downing Street premises. The new 1500sq ft space was designed with help from the world-renowned acoustic design specialist Jochen Veith. The studio facility houses a Neve VRP60/48 Legend console and a variety of professional- quality analogue and digital equipment. SSR celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2009 by launching the Anthony H Wilson (Tony Wilson) Scholarship in recognition of the contribution made by Tony to the creative and cultural life of Manchester. In November 2009, SSR was awarded the Manchester Evening News ‘Business of the Year Award’ 2009, for firms with turnover of under £5 million. In November 2018, SSR was rebranded to its original Spirit Studios name, with a greater focus on its core educational provisions within the music and audio industries. SSR London In July 2010, SSR London was launched, taking up residence in Camden’s Piano Factory building, London. The distinctive rotunda-shaped Piano Factory on Gloucester Crescent has been there for over a hundred years, built for Collard and Collard who were the oldest of the well-known piano manufacturing firms of the St Pancras area. The building was renovated with recording studios, green screen filming area and editing suites to be used as educational and commercial facilities by SSR. SSR London has also formed a partnership with the Roundhouse venue in Camden to deliver master-classes in music production. SSR Jakarta Launched in 2011, SSR Jakarta was the first overseas branch of the SSR institution. SSR Jakarta delivers industry led training programmes in audio engineering and creative media production ranging from weekend short courses to in depth 18 month programmes. As a 'Partner Institution' of the University of Central Lancashire (UCLan), SSR Jakarta delivers degree programmes in Jakarta validated by a UK University.

It was developed in the late 1980s by Harriet Friedmann and Philip McMichael. Food regime analysis is concerned with explaining, and therefore politicising, the strategic role of agriculture in the construction and development of the world capitalist economy. As a framework, it takes a historical view in order to identify stable periods of capital accumulation associated with particular configurations of geopolitical power and forms of agricultural production and consumption. Its theoretical roots are in French Regulation Theory and World Systems Theory. With its Marxist influences, food regime theorists are also interested in how moments of crisis within a particular configuration are expressive of the dialectical tension that animates movement between such configurations (i.e. periods of transition). According to leading food regime proponent Philip McMichael, then, food regimes are always characterised by contradictory forces. Further, consolidation of a regime does not so much resolve as it does contain, or else strategically accommodate, these tensions; meanwhile, their intensification, often via the mobilisations of social movements, tends to signal a period of transition. Response and criticism Some academics have claimed that the food regime theory is very limited in its ability to describe all food security issues. A key problem with the theory is that it does not look at localized issues for individual countries, but rather tries to group all the world into a broad grouping.  Key texts  The seminal texts are as follows: * Harriet Friedmann's (1987) \\"International regimes of food and agriculture since 1870\\" * Friedmann and McMichael's (1989) \\"Agriculture and the state system: the rise and fall of national agricultures, 1870 to the present\\" Further, Philip McMichael's more recent article (2009), \\"A food regime genealogy\\", provides a comprehensive overview of the development of the concept, key themes and debates, and a guide to further reading.

Marie de Médicis the wife of Henry the Great of France was one of her patients and delivered her six children. Boursier was a Royal Court midwife for many young women in her twenty-six year professional career. She made about ten times what the average midwife made. Boursier was known as a scholar and educator. Through her common-sense-based medical methods and prodigious writings she helped raise midwifery to state of the art science. She was the first woman to write a book on obstetrics. That was further expanded by other more detailed medical works by her and her descendants and colleagues that were used by medical professionals in several countries.  Early life  Bourgeois was born sometime in 1563 in what was then a farming area outside of Paris called, the Faubourg Saint-Germain. Her family was not of noble ancestry, but her father was a builder that constructed houses at the village of Bussy, fifteen miles north of Paris. She was raised in upper middle-class circumstances. She received an education customary of the children of families of that class. Bourgeois' family lived near the barber surgeon medical professional Martin Boursier, who was a pupil-assistant of Ambroise Pare. Bourgeois married Martin Boursier at the parish of Saint Sulpice in 1584. They moved to Faubourg Saint- Germain sometime between 1586 and 1587. The couple had a comfortable life style there and three children were born by September 1589. King Henri IV attacked Paris in October 1589. Bourgeois was home alone with her three children at the time. Her husband was out of the country away on duty in the army. She abandoned her rural home and most of their possessions when she retreated with her children and mother behind the city walls of Paris for protection. For an income then Bourgeois took up needlework and sold items she embroidered and pieces of valuable personal items she managed to save. This however still was barely enough income to support her family. Bourgeois' husband returned from the army sometime around 1591, but his income as a medical doctor was not enough to support the family. While Louise had their third and last child her nurse at the time suggested she go into midwifery. She took up midwifery part-time in the 1580s and by 1593 had joined the Guild of Midwives as a professional. Bourgeois learned this medical skill from her husband and Pare's writings on obstetrics. She also went to a new college for midwives at the hospital Hôtel-Dieu de Paris. She believed she was blessed with practical midwifery talents from Phaenarete, the mother of Socrates. Marie de' Medici and her family (1607) with Bourgeois being the royal court midwife then.  Career  Bourgeois obtained a diploma and license to legally practice midwifery in 1598 when she passed the examination for that profession and became a registered midwife. The judging panel consisted of a medical doctor, two barber-surgeons, and two well respected professional midwives. She then moved with her family into a fashionable house on the Left Bank at the rue Saint-Andre´des-Arts. There she built up a large scale medical practice in the Latin Quarter. She developed an excellent reputation in the delivery of two thousand babies and was well liked as a professional midwife. She was known as a foundation level scholar and educationalist because of her advanced knowledge in the field that she wrote on in various manuscripts. With her husband she headed a minor medical dynasty and pharmacy that ran down through her family that lasted for decades. Henry the Great of France married Marie de' Medici in 1600. Their first child was due in 1601. The King wanted to employ Madame Dupuis to be the royal midwife. Marie de' Medici chose Bourgeois instead because she demonstrated authority. She had successfully assisted the childbirths of several young ladies of the Royal Court as a loyal professional midwife. Bourgeois writes her experience on this first childbirth of Queen Marie in her 1617 book True accounts of the births of the royal children of France. Between 1601 and 1610 (when Henri IV was killed) six children were born to Marie de' Medici, all assisted by Bourgeois. They were Louis XIII, future King of France (1601), Elizabeth, Queen of Spain (1602), Christine Marie, Duchess of Savoy (1607), Nicolas Henri, Duke of Orléans (1607), Gaston, Duke of Orléans (1608), and Henrietta Maria, Queen of England, Queen of Scots and Queen of Ireland (1609). Bourgeois received 500 livres (crowns) of money for each son delivered and 300 livres for each daughter. The average midwife at the time had an income of 50 livres for each delivery. Bourgeois's career as a royal court midwife had spanned over twenty-six years.  Later life  Bourgeois was ultimately awarded in 1608 a lump sum of 6,000 livres for her services as royal midwife. After the birth of Henrietta Maria, the last child, Bourgeois asked for a pension of 600 livres per year. King Henry IV agreed in 1610 to 300 livres, which was considered a reasonable retirement income. In her \\"retirement\\" Bourgeois wrote a great deal and made important contributions to obstetrics. She wrote a book on childbirth practices in 1609 titled Various Observations on the Sterility. Bourgeois was the first woman to write a book on midwifery. The last section of her 1609 book is Bourgeois' opinions on various topics specifically written for her daughter. She tells her to fear God, to attend the poor with charity, and to never let unmarried women into her house for confinement or to assist in abortions. She also criticizes the women of her time for preferring male physicians to midwives Additional techniques and information were added in 1759 by her descendant, Angelique le Boursier du Courdray, who was also a royal French midwife. She in turn passed this knowledge down to poor women of her time. Although she was technically retired as a royal midwife, Bourgeois still delivered children. In 1627, she delivered the child of the Duchess of Orleans. Unfortunately, the duchess died from fever after her labor. Male physicians (many of whom were enemies of Bourgeois) wrote the autopsy report, and said that a piece of afterbirth was left on the womb, implying that Bourgeois had left it there and was at fault for the duchess' death. In response to this, Bourgeois wrote the \\"Apology of Louise Bourgeois,\\" in which she questions the validity of the report. In her 'apology', Bourgeois highlights her many qualifications, and says she had practiced the midwife profession for thirty-four years. She points out that she honorably acquired the proper certificate and wrote books on midwifery that was used by physicians in several countries for years. She described herself as the first woman midwife to write on the subject.  Works  Boursier wrote five medical manuscripts between 1609 and 1634 advocating that the clinical information contained in them should be practiced by all midwives. Her first book on midwifery and childbirth written was the first ever authored by a woman. It had practical information on obstetrics. Few texts of this type existed at the time.

Life He was the third son of Rev James Bryce (1767–1857), and of Catherine Annan of Auchtermuchty in Fife, and was born at Killaig, near Coleraine, on 23 October 1806. He was educated first by his father and eldest brother, the Rev. Dr. Bryce, and afterwards at the university of Glasgow, where he graduated B.A. in 1828, having distinguished himself in classical studies. In 1826, Bryce was appointed Master of the Mathematical and Commercial Department of Belfast Academical Institution. He was Secretary of the Belfast Natural History Society from its foundation. He had intended to study for the bar, but, finding this beyond his means, adopted the profession of teaching, and became mathematical master in the Belfast Academy, a foundation school of considerable more in Ulster. In 1836, he married Margaret, daughter of James Young of Abbeyville, county Antrim, and in 1840 was appointed to the high school of Glasgow, the ancient public grammar school of that city, and held this office till his resignation in 1874. He was a brilliant and successful teacher both of mathematics and geography, but his special interest lay in the study of natural history. He devoted himself to geological researches, first in the north of Ireland, and afterwards in Scotland and northern England. He began in 1834 to write and publish articles on the fossils of the lias, greensand, and chalk beds in Antrim (the first appeared in the 'Philosophical Magazine' for that year), and these having attracted the notice of Sir Roderick Murchison and Sir Charles Lyell. He was a Fellow of the Geological Society of London and a Fellow of the Geological Society of Dublin. His more important papers (among which may be found the first complete investigation and description of the structure of the Giant's Causeway) appeared in the 'Transactions' of the London society, others in the 'Proceedings' of the Natural History Society of Belfast and of the Philosophical Society of Glasgow, of which he was more than once president. He also wrote 'A Treatise on Algebra,' which went through several editions, an introduction to 'Mathematical Astronomy and Geography.' 'A Cyclopœdia of Geography.' and a book on 'Arran and the other Clyde islands,' with special reference to their geology and antiquities. He was a warm advocate of the more general introduction into schools of the teaching of natural history as well as natural science, and set the example of giving teaching voluntarily in these subjects, for which there was in his day no regular provision in the high schools of Scotland. In 1868, he received from his university, in the reform of which he had borne a leading part, the honorary degree of LL.D. After resigning his post at Glasgow, he settled in Edinburgh, and published his later contributions to geology in the 'Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.' He was a keen and accurate observer, and having an ardent love of nature and great physical activity, continued his field work in the highlands of Scotland with unflagging zeal to the end of his life. While examining a remarkable mass of eruptive granite at Inverfarigaig, on the shores of Loch Ness, he disturbed some loose stones by the strokes of his hammer, and caused the blocks above to fall on him, killing him instantaneously, 11 July 1877. He is buried in the south-west section of the Grange Cemetery in Edinburgh. The grave is at the west end of a central east- west avenue in that section. His wife Margaret lies with him as does his son, John Annan Bryce (1843–1923) who served as MP to Inverness.

Nanosurf’s atomic force microscopes (AFM) and scanning tunneling microscopes (STM) are used for metrological surface inspections and for the visualization of structures on the nanometer scale. Nanosurf worked with NASA’s Phoenix Mars mission to provide the atomic force microscopy module for the Mars probe.  History  In 1997, Nanosurf was awarded the “Start-up-Label” by the Swiss government agency for innovation (KTI). Nanosurf was founded June 4, 1997, in order to design scanning probe microscopes that were accessible for everyone. The Nanosurf founders were inspired by Hans-Joachim Guentherodt, the Director of the Swiss NCCR Nanoscale Science, head of the Institute of Physics of the University of Basel, coordinator of the Swiss Nanoscience Institute, and chairman of the National Center of Competence in Research (NCCR) “Nanoscale Science”. In 1998, The NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory selected the Nanosurf atomic force microscope for its mission to Mars. Nanosurf joined a consortium consisting of the Institute of Microtechnology, University of Neuchatel, and the Institute of Physics, University of Basel to achieve this goal. Nanosurf was awarded the innovation prize by the Swiss Cantons of Basel-Stadt and Basel- Landschaft in 1998. In 2000, Nanosurf was awarded the Swiss Technology Award by the Swiss federal industry agency. The easyScan atomic force microscope is introduced to the market. Nanosurf received the 2003 KMU Entrepreneurial award by the Chamber of Commerce of the Cantons of Basel-Landschaft and Basel-Stadt. In 2007,Nanosurf received the Swiss Technology Award (Vontobel Stiftung) for the automated Nanite AFM system. On August 4, Phoenix Mars Probe was launched carrying a Nanosurf AFM scanner. Since its founding in 1997, Nanosurf AG established subsidiaries in Boston (USA), Langen, Hesse (Germany), Shanghai (China) and Delhi (India).  Phoenix Mars Lander Mission  Nanosurf, the University of Neuchâtel, and the University of Basel were part of a Swiss consortium challenged to equip the Phoenix Mars Probe with the first atomic force microscope in space. This atomic force microscope was designed to be part of the Microscopy, Electrochemistry, and a Conductivity Analyzer (MECA) unit built by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. It was a key component of the Phoenix probe’s ensemble of on-board scientific instruments. Nanosurf contributed to the Phoenix Mars Mission with an AFM that recorded high- resolution images of Martian dust. These images allowed researchers to study the history of water on Mars, and represent the highest resolution images ever recorded on another planet. Nanosurf joined in developing, building and testing an atomic force microscope for planetary science applications, in particular for the study of Martian soil. The system consists of a controller board, an electromagnetic scanner and micro-fabricated sensor-chip. Eight cantilevers with integrated, piezoresistive deflection sensors are aligned in a row and are engaged one after the other to provide redundancy in case of tip or cantilever failure. Silicon and molded diamond tips are used for probing the sample. Images can be recorded in both, static and dynamic operation mode. In the latter case, excitation of the resonance frequencies of the cantilevers is achieved by vibrating the whole chip with a piezoelectric disk. This instrument represents the highest spatial resolution instrument ever produced for in situ planetary studies. The required level of operational robustness was achieved by using a redundant array of microfabricated cantilevers.  First Atomic Force Microscope Image on Mars  File:First Atomic Force Microscope Image from Mars.jpg The first image recorded by an atomic force microscope on another planet. On July 9, 2008, Mars day 44 of the Phoenix Mars Mission, the atomic force microscope on the Mars Lander recorded an image of a test grid, which serves as a calibration for the microscope. This image was successfully transmitted to Earth by the Phoenix Mars probe, and demonstrates full functionality of the nano-imaging device under the harsh Martian conditions, satisfying the NASA Phoenix team as well as the Swiss scientific team responsible for the development of the microscope. The area imaged by the microscope is 40 × 40 µm, small enough to fit on an eyelash. The grooves in this substrate are apart, from center to center. The vertical dimension is exaggerated in the image to make surface details more visible. The grooves are deep.

Spore-forming organs or sporangia, which were elliptical, being longer than wide, were borne on the end regions of stems. Macivera is considered to be a zosterophyll. Description The genus was first described from a small number of specimens found in sediments in Bathurst Island, Nunavut, Canada, which are considered to be of Late Silurian age (Ludfordian, around ). Stems (axes) were smooth, devoid of leaves, hairs or other protrusions, and were between 0.7 and 1.0 mm wide (around the lower limit of the size Boyce suggested as being compatible with the presence of vascular tissue), tapering down to 0.1 mm towards the apex of those stems which did not bear sporangia. The stems branched equally and dichotomously, with some suggestion of downwards branching at the base. The overall height of the plant is estimated to be some 8 cm. Spore-forming organs or sporangia were borne towards the end of stems, apparently in clusters, angled slightly away from the upright. They were either borne directly on the stem or had short stalks, and do not appear to have been arranged into distinct rows. Sporangia were elliptical in shape, 1.3 to 2.0 mm high and 1.1 to 1.3 mm wide, so that they were longer than wide. As is typical of zosterophylls, they split to release their spores via a linear opening at the opposite end to their attachment to the stem. Spores were found, around 50 µm in diameter, but may have been immature; they were of one size range (i.e. the plant was homosporous). Taxonomy The genus and species Macivera gracilis were named in 2002. The genus name is in memory of Elisabeth E. McIver, a paleobotanist and collector of plant fossils from Bathurst Island. The specific epithet refers to the thinness of the stems. Phylogeny The position of the sporangia on the sides of stems and the way in which they split to release spores suggests a relationship with the zosterophylls. The distinctive features of Macivera are its small size, and the nature of its sporangia which are elongated rather than wider than high or kidney-shaped, and which have short or no stalks while not being borne in clear rows. The closest comparison was considered by Kotyk et al. to be with the genus Distichophytum, but this has its sporangia in two more-or-less opposite rows. Hicklingia edwardii has similarly shaped and arranged sporangia, but they are considerably larger and stalked. Hao and Xue in 2013 listed the genus as a zosterophyll.

Officially announced by HTC on February 15, 2011 at MWC 2011 in Barcelona, Spain alongside the HTC Desire S and the HTC Wildfire S, the HTC Incredible S was launched exclusively in the UK to Carphone Warehouse & Best Buy on February 26, 2011 marketed by Sarah Harding of Girls Aloud. The Incredible S is the successor to the Droid Incredible.  History  = Development = During development, the device was codenamed Vivo and little was known about it before release. It is available as a CDMA variant on the US network Verizon as of May 2011 under the name Droid Incredible 2, and it is a world phone able to access both GSM and CDMA networks.  Hardware  Backside The HTC Incredible S is the latest of a long line of smartphones based around the 1 GHz Snapdragon chipset made by Qualcomm. In terms of hardware, it is very similar to the Desire HD with a few notable differences: * Smaller screen: 4.0\\" compared to 4.3\\" * Larger Battery: 1,450 mAh compared to 1230mAh * Screen technology: An S-LCD screen compared to the original Desire's AMOLED display. However, the Desire's screen was replaced with an S-LCD on later versions. * Addition of a 1.3 MP fixed-focus front-facing camera for video calling In a move seen as a new trend for HTC, the antenna for the phone is built into the back cover of the case (this is also true of the HTC Sensation). A unique feature of the Incredible S is the auto-rotating nature of the capacitive buttons below the screen. Despite HTC recent design trend, the back is made of a rubberised plastic instead an aluminium body, presumably to help improve signal reception. The front is mainly covered by a sheet of gorilla glass, with a thin aluminium surround. In addition to the specification already mentioned, the Incredible S houses dual microphones for noise cancellation. = Regional variations = The version that has been made available in Canada for reviewers has been seen to have chrome accents around the screen, speaker grill, camera lens, LED flash bulbs and loudspeaker which the European and Asian version do not have. A red version is in production and has been spotted in Hong Kong and Singapore. As of November 24, 2011, the HTC Droid Incredible 2 has been available in a limited edition red color, instead of the usual black.  Software  HTC announced that the Incredible S will be upgradable to the Android 4.0 ICS, though the software update still hasn't been released for its U.S. counterpart, the Droid Incredible 2, more than two years later. The device was shipped with the second version of HTC's Sense, which includes satellite navigation software developed by TomTom using maps from Route66 (30 day free trial included) and a digital bookstore from Kobo fully integrated into the system. For the UK release, the UK & Northern Ireland maps are pre- loaded onto the bundled 8 GB microSD card. The device is a part of the new generation of HTC phones that have a signed bootloader. As a consequence, the phone cannot be easily rooted, and the user is denied administrative rights to the phone. However, users have achieved root despite the signed bootloader.

Its territory was called Argeia (Ἀργεία). Foundation legend Its inhabitants laid claim to their city having been colonized from the celebrated Argos in Peloponnesus, though the legends of its foundation somewhat differed. It was, according to one tradition, founded by Amphilochus, son of Amphiaraüs, after the Trojan War. Amphilochus, being dissatisfied with the state of things in Argos on his return from Troy, emigrated from his native place, and founded a city of the same name on the Ambraciot Gulf and the whole region of Amphilochia. According to another tradition, it was founded by Alcmaeon, who called it after his brother Amphilochus.Apollod. 3.7.7; History But whether the city owed its origin to an Argive colony or not, we know that the Amphilochi were regarded as barbarians, or a-non-Hellenic race, at the commencement of the Peloponnesian War, and that shortly before that time the inhabitants of Argos were the only portion of the Amphilochi, who had become Hellenized. This they owed to some colonists from Ambracia, whom they admitted into the city to reside along with them. According to Thucydides, \\"at that time [the inhabitants of Amphilochian Argos] became hellenized, regarding their present language, by their Ambraciot fellow-settlers.\\" The Ambraciots, however, soon expelled the original inhabitants, and kept the town, with its territory, exclusively for themselves. The expelled inhabitants placed themselves under the protection of the Acarnanians, and both people applied to Athens for assistance. The Athenians accordingly sent a force under Phormio, who took Argos, sold the Ambraciots as slaves, and restored the town to the Amphilochians and Acarnanians, both of whom now concluded an alliance with Athens. This event probably happened in the year before the Peloponnesian War, 432 BCE. It took an active part on the Athenian side during the Peloponnesian War in alliance with its neighbours the Acarnanians against the Ambraciots and Leucadians, who were supported by their mother city, Corinth, and the Peloponnesian League. In 430 BCE the Ambraciots, anxious to recover the lost town, marched against Argos, but were unable to take it, and retired, after laying waste its territory. In 426 BCE they made a still more vigorous effort to recover Argos. The Ambraciots having received the promise of assistance from Eurylochus, the Spartan commander, who was then in Aetolia, marched with 3000 hoplites into the territory of Argos, and captured the fortified hill of Olpae (Ὄλπαι), close upon the Ambracian gulf, 25 stadia (about 3 miles or 5 km) from Argos itself. Thereupon the Acarnanians marched to the protection of Argos, and took up their position at a spot called Crenae (Κρῆναι), or 'the Wells', at no great distance from Argos. Meantime Eurylochus, with the Peloponnesian forces, had marched through Acarnania, and had succeeded in joining the Ambraciots at Olpae, passing unperceived between Argos itself and the Acarnanian force at Crenae. He then took post at Metropolis (Μητρόπολις), a place probably northeast of Olpae. Shortly afterwards Demosthenes, who had been invited by the Acarnanians to take the command of their troops, arrived in the Ambraciot Gulf with 20 Athenian ships, and anchored near Olpae. Having disembarked his men, and taken the command, he encamped near Olpae. The two armies were separated only by a deep ravine: and as the ground was favourable for ambush, Demosthenes hid some men in a bushy dell, so that they might attack the rear of the enemy. The stratagem was successful, Demosthenes gained a decisive victory, and Eurylochus was slain in the battle. This victory was followed by another still more striking. The Ambraciots at Olpae had some days before sent to Ambracia, to beg for reinforcements; and a large Ambraciot force had entered the territory of Amphilochia about the time when the Battle of Olpae was fought. Demosthenes being informed of their march on the day after the battle, formed a plan to surprise them in a narrow pass above Olpae. At this pass there were two conspicuous peaks, called respectively the greater and the lesser Idomene (Ἰδομένη). The lesser Idomene seems to have been at the northern entrance of the pass, and the greater Idomene at the southern entrance. As it was known that the Ambraciots would rest for the night at the lower of the two peaks, ready to march through the pass the next morning, Demosthenes sent forward a detachment to secure the higher peak, and then marched through the pass in the night. The Ambraciots had obtained no intelligence of the defeat of their comrades at Olpae, or of the approach of Demosthenes; they were surprised in their sleep, and put to the sword without any possibility of resistance. Thucydides considers the loss of the Ambraciots to have been the greatest that befell any Grecian city during the whole war prior to the Peace of Nicias; and he says, that if Demosthenes and the Acarnanians had marched against Ambracia at once, the city must have surrendered without a blow. The Acarnanians, however, refused to undertake the enterprise, fearing that the Athenians might be more troublesome neighbours to them than the Ambraciots. On the contrary, they and the Amphilochians now concluded a peace with the Ambraciots for 100 years.Grote, Hist. of Greece, vol. vi. p. 408, et seq. We know little more of the history of Argos. Some time after the death of Alexander the Great, it fell into the hands of the Aetolians, together with the rest of Ambracia: and it was here that the Roman general, M. Fulvius, took up his quarters, when he concluded the treaty between Rome and the Aetolians. Upon the foundation of Nicopolis by Augustus, after the Battle of Actium, the inhabitants of Argos were removed to the former city, and Argos was henceforth deserted.Anth. Gr. 9.553. It is, however, mentioned by later writers such as Pliny the Elder, Pomponius Mela, and Ptolemy. Site The site of Argos has been a subject of dispute. Thucydides says that it was situated on the sea. Polybius describes it as distant 180 stadia, and Livy 22 miles from Ambracia. William Martin Leake, writing in the 19th century placed it in the plain of Vlikha, at the modern village of Neokhori, where are the ruins of an ancient city, the walls of which were about a mile (1.6 km) in circumference. The editors of the Barrington Atlas of the Greek and Roman World tentatively identify a place called Ag. Ioannes, near Neokhori as the site of Argos.

Description Typically, a parent may take a sick child to a traditional healer, who will look in the child's mouth and attribute the illness to \\"tooth worms\\". The healer will point out the small, white, developing tooth buds as being \\"tooth worms\\", and then dig the \\"worms\\" out of the gums without local anesthesia and using a non- sterile tool (normally a bicycle spoke). The canine teeth are often the ones pointed out, as they are more prominent. The excised tooth buds are then shown to the parent, their small, milky appearance somewhat resembling worms. Harm This practice inflicts pain and suffering on a child who may already be sick (or teething), and in some cases it is carried out on a healthy child in a bid to prevent illness. The unhygienic methods can cause blood infections, tetanus, pass on HIV/AIDS, and can on occasion be fatal during or after the procedure. The underlying permanent tooth buds can be damaged or eradicated, causing lifelong dental problems. In addition, the existing illness may not receive the medical attention necessary.

Neuropathy target esterase is a phospholipase that deacetylates intracellular phosphatidylcholine to produce glycerophosphocholine. It is thought to function in neurite outgrowth and process elongation during neuronal differentiation. The protein is anchored to the cytoplasmic face of the endoplasmic reticulum in both neurons and non- neuronal cells.  Function  Neuropathy target esterase is an enzyme with phospholipase B activity: it sequentially hydrolyses both fatty acids from the major membrane lipid phosphatidylcholine, generating water-soluble glycerophosphocholine. In eukaryotic cells, NTE is anchored to the cytoplasmic face of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. In mammals, it is particularly abundant in neurons, the placenta, and the kidney. Loss of NTE activity results in abnormally-elevated levels of phosphatidylcholine in the brain and impairment of the constitutive secretory pathway in neurons. In the kidney, the expression of neuropathy target esterase is regulated by TonEBP as part of osmolyte production when the kidney produces concentrated urine.  Clinical significance  Mutations in this gene result in autosomal-recessive spastic paraplegia. The protein is also the target for neurodegeneration induced by organophosphorus compounds and chemical warfare agents. Recessively-inherited mutations in NTE that substantially reduce its catalytic activity cause a rare form of hereditary spastic paraplegia (SPG39), in which distal parts of long spinal axons degenerate leading to limb weakness and paralysis. Organophosphate-induced delayed neuropathy a paralysing syndrome with distal degeneration of long axons results from poisoning with neuropathic organophosphorus compounds that irreversibly inhibit NTE.

The tombstone is necessary, as distributed data stores use eventual consistency, where only a subset of nodes where the data is stored must respond before an operation is considered to be successful.  Motivation  If information is deleted in an eventually-consistent distributed data store, the \\"eventual\\" part of the eventual consistency causes the information to ooze through the node structure, where some nodes may be unavailable at time of deletion. But a feature of eventual consistency causes a problem in case of deletion, as a node that was unavailable at that time will try to \\"update\\" the other nodes that no longer have the deleted entry, assuming that they have missed an insert of information. Therefore, instead of deleting the information, the distributed data store creates a (usually temporary) tombstone record, which is not returned in response to requests.  Removal of tombstones  In order not to fill the data store with trash information, there is a policy to remove tombstones completely. For this, the system checks the age of the tombstone and will remove it after a prescribed time has elapsed. In Apache Cassandra, this elapsed time is set with the \`GCGraceSeconds\` parameter and the process is named Compaction.. Compaction consumes system resources and also slows down computation capacity.  Consequences  Because of the delayed removal, the deleted information will appear as empty, after the content of some columns of a number of records has been deleted. After a compaction, the unused columns will be removed from these records.

His reputation earned him many honours and accolades; he was elected member of the Royal Society of Arts, and received the rare honour: Freedom of the City of London. Early Days William Thompson Casson was born at Aspatria, Cumberland in 1844. After losing his parents in early childhood he became ward to his grandparents, local weavers, Robert and Isabella Burnett. After receiving an elementary education at the local school, he became an apprentice to John Ferguson, an Aspatria coach-builder of some repute.Rose and Dunglinson (1987), p.106 At work he had a meteoric rise; he trained as a wheelwright, developed into a draughtsman, and became Works Manager, before the age of twenty-five. Casson was also a small-time bicycle manufacturer in his own right, building his first bike simply because none of the ones on the market fitted his requirements. According to contemporary reports the finished design was not too dissimilar to the modern cycle. A close friend and fellow Aspatrian, Thomas Walker, founder of the Cockermouth monumental masons firm of Walker Brothers, bought one. Walker was apprenticed to Henry Graves, quarry owner and mason, who in his capacity of foreman supervised the building of Aspatria vicarage, and the churches of Bridekirk and Silloth. According to Walker, the sight of Casson speeding along the streets of Aspatria with his feet resting on the handlebars brought terror to the entire neighbourhood.Workington Times and Star 7 September 1990 He also enrolled for part-time education at the newly established Aspatria Agricultural College and became one of the institutions earliest successes. In 1875, the court of the Worshipful Company of Coachmakers and Coach Harness Makers of London bestowed a number of honours. He obtained a First Class prize for plane, practical and solid geometry; a Second Class prize for theoretical mechanics; a Bronze Medal and a technology prize of two guineas.West Cumberland Times 15 June 1875 While at the 'Technology of Carriage Making' examination, held on behalf of the Royal Society of Arts he gained an additional First Class Certificate and a prize of £5.West Cumberland Times 5 January 187 In 1876, he won a further Silver Medal and also a Certificate of Merit for the best treatise on carriage construction.West Cumberland Times 20 August 1876 London In 1877 Casson married the daughter of Joseph Charters of Baggrow, Cumberland and migrated to London, where he became representative to Messrs Hooper & Co., coachmakers to Queen Victoria. The Worshipful Company’s annual report for 1877 drew special attention to Casson’s technical ability in the design of a Salisbury Boot. The boot was of curved form covered with leather, placed on the front gearing under the driver’s seat. In the 19th century it was much in fashion for dress carriages of the aristocracy. Casson had displayed not only a good practical knowledge of construction, but a thorough scientific knowledge of design methodology. The receipt of a further Silver Medal, and the company’s certificate for four outline drawings, plans and sections for Omnibus, Barouche, and Salisbury Boot brought his ability to a wide audience.West Cumberland Times 20 September 1877 In 1877, on behalf of his employer, he visited the centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia, USA, where he obtained the medal and highest commendation awarded to an international exhibitor. Master coachbuilder By 1878, Casson had become a ‘master coachbuilder’ and in consequence entered into a partnership with Cook and Co., the Malvern Link, Carriage Works in Malvern, Worcestershire. He also became one of seven representatives chosen by the Carriage Builders Institute and the Royal Society of Arts to attend and report on the carriages exhibited at the 1878 Paris Exhibition.West Cumberland Times 4 August 1909 Later that year he exhibited a series of eighteen engravings depicting facets of carriage design at an exhibition held in the Mansion House, London. In 1880, Casson took the first prize for a two-wheeled brake in an open competition at Newcastle upon Tyne. In 1990, the Worshipful Company of Coach and Harness Makers of London awarded him, not only the freedom of their company but also the freedom of the City of London, a joint honour only bestowed by that company on three previous occasions.West Cumberland Times 20 July 1890 He later became a member of the Royal Society of the Arts. In 1891, Casson took over the business, Starkey and Co, of Ross on Wye and continued to run a successful business until his death in 1909.West Cumberland Times 4 August 1909 References Bibliography * People from Aspatria Manufacturing in the United Kingdom 1844 births 1909 deaths ","title":"William Thompson Casson"},{"id":"31487702","text":"Dörbet may refers to: * Dorbet Oirat, one of the four Oirat tribes of Dzungaria * Eastern Dorbet, a Khorchin-Kharchin Mongol tribe ","title":"Dörbet"},{"id":"31487709","text":"Alucita entoprocta is a species of moth of the family Alucitidae.

The film is supposedly inspired by real events that took place in the 1940s, but no information can be found to authenticate the aforementioned claims. A small-budget film originally intended for local audiences, it has achieved success in several important international film festivals such as the Cannes Film Festival (where it was shown at Director's Fortnight). At the 2011 Sundance Film Festival, Chris Kentis and Laura Lau presented an English- language remake titled Silent House, starring Elizabeth Olsen. Plot Laura and her father Wilson arrive at a cottage in a secluded area to repair it. The owner, Nestor, will put the house on sale. He tells them that the second level is unstable and it is unsafe to go upstairs. They intend to spend the night in the house. Because the windows are nailed shut, the house's interior is dark even during the day. Laura finds a radio playing a haunting melody, which she turns off. Shortly after, her father goes upstairs to check a noise and Laura hears what appears to be combat. Moments later, she finds her father restrained and murdered downstairs. She cries and hugs his body, getting his blood on herself in the process. Laura attempts to flee but someone has locked the doors. Armed with a reap hook and a lamp, she stumbles through the house in order to find a way outside. She notices that her father's dead body has been moved into the chair and that someone has placed a puppet on him. Another melody plays, this time from the upper floor. She goes upstairs and turns off another radio. She hears footsteps and hides. An unknown person with a knife and lamp enters the room, then leaves. Laura finds the key to the front door and escapes the house. After manically running, she stops on the road. Her pursuer approaches but disappears when Laura is almost run over by Nestor. She tells Nestor about the attack but the latter is unconvinced. They search the house and Nestor disappears. Laura's lamp shuts off so she uses an old Polaroid camera to light the room through the camera's flash each time she takes a photo. In the photos, she sees a little girl in a white dress and a young man trying to stab her. She flees to the next room, where she discovers many photos on a wall and in a baby buggy. They mainly show Nestor and a woman in underwear. She then finds Nestor restrained and injured downstairs. They kiss each other and have a conversation: Nestor tells Laura that he loves her and only called her father in order to see her. Laura mentions his pictures and asks: \\"Do you miss her? Do you want to tell her something? She is here now.\\" In a mirror, the little girl is visible, appearing to be in the room. During the conversation, Laura becomes more and more aggressive until she finally shouts and says, \\"You two killed my baby. You're going to die in the manner that my father did.\\" She sits Nestor in the chair after removing her father's corpse, puts the mysterious puppet on him, and kills him with her reap hook. The ending credits show photos of the past with Laura, Nestor and her father. The film continues, showing Laura burning the pictures and walking through the forest. She meets a small child named Sophie. Sophie is the daughter that Laura had with Nestor. They walk hand-in-hand, promising to start a new life together. The camera zooms out, revealing that Laura is only holding Sophie's doll, implying that Laura has lost all touch with reality. Production La Casa Muda was shot to look like it was in real time in one continuous 88 minute take. Its claims that it is one of only a handful of theatrically-released movies to be shot in a continuous long take, and that it is the first ever single-take horror film, are contentious, as the camera used, the Canon EOS 5D Mark II, can only film up to 15 minutes of continuous footage. With a budget of just six thousand dollars, it was filmed using a handheld high-definition digital single-lens reflex camera (the Canon EOS 5D Mark II) over a time period of just four days. Release and reception The film premiered at the Cannes Film Festival on 16 May 2010, a Director's Fortnight selection. That summer and fall it was screened on the festival circuit at the Melbourne International Film Festival, Sitges Film Festival, and the Stockholm International Film Festival. Its first theatrical release began on 27 January 2011 in Argentina. This was followed by a 4 March release in Uruguay, where it was produced. It received mixed reviews after its 8 April 2011 release in the UK, with critics generally praising the director's technical achievements, but finding the overall story line unimpressive. Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian praised the film, writing: \\"This is a smart, scary film and a technical tour de force with its own skin-crawling atmosphere of fear.\\" The film was selected as the Uruguayan entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 84th Academy Awards, but it did not make the final shortlist. Project Deadpost website gave the film a score of 90% calling it an \\"ultra-low budget, brilliant, scary little film from Uruguay that outdoes many big budget contenders\\".

Background Ferdinand VII had become king after the victorious end of the Peninsular War, by which Spain was freed from Napoleonic domination. He returned to Spain on 24 March 1814 and his first act was the abolition of the 1812 liberal constitution; this was followed by the dissolution of the two chambers of the Spanish Parliament on 10 May. These were only the first moves towards a severe anti-liberal reaction, which caused a series of military riots, started in January 1820 by General Rafael del Riego. The monarch was forced to reintroduce a constitution, with a solemn oath during a ceremony in Madrid on 10 March 1820. This began the so-called Trienio Liberal (\\"Liberal Triennium\\", or Constitutional Triennium), during which Ferdinand had to witness the fall of the main absolutist institutions and privileges, and the increasing shift towards radicalism of the Parliament's majority. Ferdinand, however, had not abandoned his reactionary goals, and appealed to the Holy Alliance established at the Congress of Vienna in 1814, by which the main absolutist monarchies of Europe had agreed to help each other in case one of them had to suffer a democratic revolution. On 7 April 1823, France launched an expedition, by which a military corps, known as the One Hundred Thousand Sons of St. Louis (Los Cien Mil Hijos de San Luis) and led by Louis Antoine, Duke of Angoulême, invaded the Spanish territory. Louis was welcomed on 24 May in Madrid, after the liberals had abandoned the city and taken refuge in the commercial city of Cádiz, where Ferdinand was kept as prisoner. Here the democratic Cortes met to declare the king's deposition. The French troops besieged the city, until 31 August, when the Battle of Trocadero marked the liberals' defeat and the capitulation of the city. History =Reactionary restoration= Ferdinand VII depicted by Francisco Goya. After his restoration, Ferdinand VII started a period of his reign known as \\"Ominous Decade\\", due to its marked stress on the suppression of his enemies. Most of the members of the Liberal Party fled abroad, to London (where some received monetary help by the British government for their role in the wars against Napoleon), Paris, Malta, the United States, or to newly proclaimed independent republics of South America, towards which the Spanish liberal government had held a far less hostile stance than Ferdinand VII. Others, instead, were ruthlessly eliminated, such as Del Riego, the main symbol of the revolution, who was hanged on 7 November 1823 in La Cebada Square of Madrid. Harsh censorship was re-established, while an archaic and totally reactionary organization of universities was introduced under the strict control of the Minister of Justice, Francisco Tadeo Calomarde, who was the mastermind of the suppression of opposition and of the restoration of former institutions, such as the Jesuits (outlawed by the Bourbons in the late 18th century), monasteries and others. The French corps remained in Spain, with the de facto role of an occupation force: however, its heavy cost of supply caused further damage to the Spanish treasury, which had been depleted under the liberal government, also due to the South American revolutions. The discontent of the Spanish military was further spurred by the formation of the Voluntarios Realistas (\\"Royalist Volunteers\\"), a militia created by Ferdinand VII in 1823, a short time after the collapse of the constitutional cabinet, in order to provide the king a direct means of suppression against the liberal opposition. In 1826 the militia amounted to some 200,000 volunteers, half of which included in 486 infantry battalions, 20 artillery companies, 52 cavalry squadrons and some sappers companies. =Political instability= The decade saw an endless series of riots and attempts of revolutions, such as that of Torrijos, funded by English liberals, on 11 December 1831. Aside from the liberal side, Ferdinand's policies caused discontent also in the conservative party: in 1827 a revolt broke out in Catalonia, and later extended to Valencia, Aragon, the Basque Country and Andalusia, spurred by ultra- reactionaries according to whom Ferdinand's restoration had been too timid, failing in particular to reinstate the Inquisition. In what was called the War of the Agraviados, some 30,000 men controlled most of Catalonia and some of the northern regions, and even established an autonomous government. Ferdinand intervened personally, moving to Tarragona to quench the revolt: he promised an amnesty, but once the rioters had surrendered, he had their leaders executed and others exiled to France. Further instability came when, on 31 March 1830, Ferdinand issued the Pragmatic Sanction, which had been approved by his father Charles IV as early as 1789, but not published till then. The decree allowed the succession to the Spanish throne also to female heirs, in case a male one was not available. Ferdinand would have only one child, a daughter, the future queen Isabella II, who was born in October 1830. The Sanction excluded from the succession Ferdinand's brother, Carlos, Count of Molina. =Illness and death of Ferdinand= In his later years, Ferdinand fell severely ill, and he lost the ability to direct his own affairs. His young wife, Maria Christina of the Two Sicilies, took the regency. Since the other pretender, Don Carlos, was considered a champion of absolutism, Maria Christina decided to seek support from the liberal opposition. Her policy worsened the acrimony amongst Carlos's supporters. At Ferdinand's death, in 1833, Carlos declared himself the legitimate heir to the throne with the name of Charles V. This was the beginning of the First Carlist War.

The show was focused on electronic and dance music. It significantly contributed to the popularity of electronic music in the Czech Republic. Conception Dance Extravaganza was broadcast every Saturday and was hosted by Marek Řeřicha who provided spoken word, created track lists, played his own sets and also interviewed many guests both directly in the studio or over the phone. Live sets created directly in the studio became and indispensable part of the show. The live guests included many respected djs such as Michael Burian, Dj Lucca, Dj Ladida, Tomáš Haverlík, etc. It was also the only radio show in the Czech Republic at that time that contained sets by internationally known djs and music groups. These included Carl Cox, Tom Middleton, Groove Armada, Armin van Buuren, Eric Morillo, The Chemical Brothers, Eric Prydz, etc. History The show was launched on 5 July 1997. The initial episodes offered dance music which could be described as commercial but it has later developed into more sophisticated programme that offered also some less-known styles such as progressive house and helped to popularise them. On its peak, Dance Extravaganza brought live broadcasts from large events Summer of Love 2005 and Paul van Dyk's gig in Prague. The show won the Czech Dance Award for the best radio show multiple times. Despite the huge popularity of the show, Evropa 2 has decided to cancel it after 9 years due to unspecified problems with Řeřicha. The last episode was broadcast on 24 June 2006. During the years, Dance Extravaganza has gained a cult following. After withdrawing the original show and a short gap, Evropa 2 has introduced similar programme called Dance Exxtravaganza. The original broadcasting schedule has changed and the host was replaced by a group of resident djs who prepare the programme beforehands. Supporters\` initiative As Dance Exxtravaganza's departure from the original scheme disappointed some fans, they created a non-commercial website which allows them to share their personal recordings of the show from the years 1997 - 2006. Its goal is to gather as many recordings of Dance Extravaganza that cover the entire life- span of the show because it had not been made accessible by the radio station.

Early life She was the daughter of Floyd and Florence Simmons Huling. They divorced when Lorraine was five, and her mother worked in Chicago, Illinois, as a nurse/receptionist for Edmund James Doering, who became her lover as well as a father figure for Lorraine. Lorraine attended Chicago public schools and a convent school for the first few years of her education; her mother later placed her in a variety of boarding schools in the United States and abroad. Lorraine spent several summers in Westbrook, Connecticut, with her grandmother, Mary Elizabeth Lyman Simmons, and also frequently travelled abroad with her mother and Doering. When Lorraine was 15, Florence's relationship with Doering ended and she married Charles Young, who drank heavily and made advances to Lorraine on at least one occasion. Stage and film Encouraged by her mother to go on the stage, Lorraine made her Broadway debut in 1913, playing the role of \\"Doll\\" in Prunella; she began acting in silent films produced by the Thannhauser Company in New Rochelle, New York, the following year. In 1915, while working as a model in New York City, she met Richard Field Maynard, a portrait painter and Harvard College graduate. A romantic relationship developed between them but was opposed by Richard's parents, who were concerned about the age difference between Richard (born in 1875) and Lorraine, and also about Lorraine's career as an actress. Lorraine's mother also objected to the match, and moved to Hollywood, California, with her daughter. Lorraine appeared in several more films, including King Lear, in which she played Cordelia, and The Fall of a Nation, a response to D.W. Griffith's The Birth of a Nation. (The two films were based on books by the same author, Thomas Dixon, who directed The Fall of a Nation.) Lorraine and Richard corresponded during their separation and married in 1917, with Lorraine retiring from the screen. They had two daughters, Sylvia (born in 1921) and Beverly (born in 1923). Writing Shortly after their marriage, Lorraine began taking creative writing classes at Columbia University. A number of her stories were published in magazines for children; in both 1929 and 1930, her stories were included in anthologies of \\"best\\" children's stories. She also wrote the children's books Twinkle Little Movie Star, which drew on her knowledge of Hollywood and moviemaking, and Dilly Was Different. In the 1930s, Lorraine began therapy with David Seabury and formed a deep attachment to him. She worked with him on his books, transcribing at least one into Braille, and he provided the introduction to her Genius in Chrysalis: Locked Doors on Greatness Within. Lorraine's last book, Bellevue, written with Dr. Laurence Miscall, was published in 1940. Richard Field Maynard died in 1964 and Lorraine, increasingly dismayed at growing old, committed suicide in her home in Old Greenwich, Connecticut, in November 15, 1971.

Life A son of Marc Louis de Trogoff de Kerlessy and Jeanne Eléonore Bourel de Kermès, de Kerlessy joined the Ancien Régime French fleet as a volunteer in 1764 and fought in the 1765 campaign against the Salétins. From 1773 to 1774 he took part in an exploratory voyage under Kerguelen, during which he was promoted to enseigne de vaisseau. He was captured by a British privateer in 1778. In March of the next year Trogoff was promoted lieutenant de vaisseau. After fighting under d'Estaing, he was made second in command of the 74-gun Glorieux, which became part of the comte de Grasse's squadron in March 1781, which in September 1781 defeated the British at Chesapeake. However, de Kerlessy was then also present at the squadron's defeat at the Saintes on 12 April 1782. When the British commander Rodney cut the French line, the Glorieux found itself fired on by six British ships of the line in rapid succession and her commander was soon killed. de Kerlessy then took over command, though the ship was now disabled. He then fought on for more than six hours, losing most of his crew killed and wounded before finally striking his flag and surrendering. He was taken prisoner but freed in 1783. His heroic defense resulted in his acquittal at the court martial for the loss of his vessel. He was promoted to capitaine de vaisseau in 1784 and given the cross of the order of Saint-Louis. Trogoff's great knowledge of the Antilles led to his holding several commands on Saint-Domingue, including the Active in 1786, then the Duguay-Trouin in 1791. The latter carried several soldiers to the island to reinforce French control after riots and protests against the abolition of slavery. He was made a contre-amiral on 1 January 1793 and commander in chief of France's Atlantic forces on 25 May 1793. He returned to the Mediterranean and in August 1793 handed Toulon and its fleet over to the British. One of his adjutants, Saint-Julien, refused to surrender and defected to the Republican forces with 300 sailors. Trogoff was made an outlaw by the Republican government on 9 September that year and on 18 December boarded a British ship after Dugommier and Napoleon Bonaparte retook the town. William Sidney Smith set fire to the main magazine and eight of the French ships of the line before departing. Trogoff emigrated, subsequently dying in February 1794.

Afterwards, he was drafted into the Imperial Russian Army to fight on the Southeastern front during World War I. In 1919 he joined the Volunteer Army. His early works were published in various Kiev literary journals. In 1924, after his emigration to France, he organized and chaired the Union of Young Poets and Prose Writers in Paris. In 1955 he became the head of the literary criticism section of the Paris magazine Russian Thought (Русская Мысль). Terapiano published six books of poetry but became known mostly for his collection of memoirs and articles Meetings (Встречи, 1953), and the Russian émigré anthology The Muse of Diaspora (Муза диаспоры, 1960). He also published a novella Voyage to an Unknown Country: Eastern Legends (Paris - 1946). Literary work Terapiano's poetry shows the influence of the Acmeist school, though formally he wasn't a member of the circle. He aspired toward \\"simplicity in his artistic method, self-awareness, moderation and purity of expression, and an intense search for God,\\" according to critic Konstantin Mochulsky.

A denationalized citizen does not consider the nation-state as being necessary for political participation and identity. Overview The concept of citizenship has historically been associated with national identity and the nation-state since the French Revolution saw the people claim sovereignty of the state and essentially become the state.Kadioglu, Ayse. Denationalization of Citizenship? The Turkish Experience. Citizenship Studies. 2007.11 (3), p. 284 The growing importance of global processes has led to practices which were previously uniquely bound with the nation-state moving to other private, supranational and subnational institutions and spheres.Sassen, Saskia. The Need to Distinguish Denationalized and Postnational. Indiana Journal of Global Legal Studies. 2000. 7 (2), pp. 579 Denationalized citizenship is a concept which has emerged due to complex processes associated with globalization and the consequent changes of the role of the nation-state due to privatization, deregulation and increased human rights.Sassen, Saskia. Towards Post-National Citizenship.In: Isin, E. and Turner, B. (eds.) Handbook of Citizenship Studies. 2002. p. 276 These globalization processes occurring most notably since the 1980s have created new and strengthened pre-existing divisions within nation-states.Anderson, James. The Exaggerated Death of the Nation- State. In: Anderson, J., Brook, C., Cochrane, A. (eds.). A Global World: Re- ordering Political Space. 1995. p. 119 Put simply, denationalized citizenship is when communities have a stronger sense of belonging and identification with smaller cultural and social groups than with their nation-state.Sassen, Saskia. Towards Post-National Citizenship.In: Isin, E. and Turner, B. (eds.) Handbook of Citizenship Studies. 2002. p. 281 For example, some see the United States as a nation of nationalities more than a nation-state.Karst, Kenneth. Citizenship, Law and the American Nation. Indiana Journal of Global Legal Studies. 2000. 7 (2), p. 595 Denationalized citizenship suggests that citizenship can be practiced at a variety of scales and leads to a new understanding of the relationship between citizenship and the nation-state. Denationalized citizenship is not, however, entirely disconnected from the nation-state but indicates a new way of interacting with it and within it.Kadioglu, Ayse. Denationalization of Citizenship? The Turkish Experience. Citizenship Studies. 2007. 11 (3), pp. 285 Social aspects Denationalized citizenship and an increase in self-determination can create new political spaces and arenas of participation. Denationalized citizenship may empower groups such as women who could establish a public presence and make claims on the state.Schylter, Ann. Body Politics and the Crafting of Citizenship in Peri-urban Lusaka. Feminist Africa 13 Gendered Body Politics and Crafting Citizenship. 2009. p. 23 Therefore denationalized citizenship exists partly due to the actions of the excluded.Sassen, Saskia. Towards Post-National Citizenship.In: Isin, E. and Turner, B. (eds.) Handbook of Citizenship Studies. 2002. p. 288 Increased civil rights facilitate the denationalization of citizenship as citizens can make claims against their nation-states and act autonomously in the political sphere.Sassen, S. The Need to Distinguish Denationalized and Postnational. Indiana Journal of Global Legal Studies. 2000. 7 (2), pp. 575-584 Denationalized citizenship reflects the evolving and progressing capacity of democracy and the democratization of citizenship is therefore linked to denationalization and the changing authority of nation- states.Kadioglu, Ayse. Denationalization of Citizenship? The Turkish Experience. Citizenship Studies. 2007. 11 (3), pp. 283 Another type of right which denationalizes citizenship is the portable rights within the European Union, for example, where there is a change in recognition from citizens of a nation-state to individuals as individuals.Sassen, Saskia. Limits of Power and the Complexity of Powerlessness. Unbound. 2007. Vol 3: 105. p. 112 Denationalized citizenship calls for a new understanding of citizenship as a concept which encompasses many, at times overlapping, communities and feelings of belonging and identification.Cammaerts, Bart. Citizenship, the Public Sphere and Media. In: Cammaerts, B and Carpentier, N (eds.) Reclaiming the Media: Communication rights and expanding democratic media roles. 2006. p. 2 Debates Denationalized citizenship emerges from the premise that nation- states are no longer solely capable of enhancing political participation and can in fact create an obstacle for such activity. Additionally, identity is no longer synonymous with the nation-stateKadioglu, Ayse. Denationalization of Citizenship? The Turkish Experience. Citizenship Studies. 2007. 11 (3), pp. 284 and citizenship is increasingly understood as \\"a form of identification, a type of political identity, something to be constructed, not empirically given\\" (Mouffe, 1992: 231). These points appear to challenge the sovereignty and authority of the nation-state as the traditional frame of reference for identity and political participation which imply a pressure to fragment territorial structures. =Criticisms= The idea that denationalized citizenship poses a serious problem for the nation-state is contested. Practices of national citizenship may be in decline due to the many processes transforming citizenship however some believe that these challenges do not completely undermine the state but rather signify a simultaneous reconfiguring of citizenship and the nation-state's functions. Denationalized citizenship can coexist with the nation-state but is necessary to widen the possibilities of political participation in the globalizing world. Denationalized citizenship vs. Postnational and Transnational citizenship Denationalized citizenship, postnational and transnational citizenship are frequently misused and used interchangeably, therefore a distinction between the terms is important. Denationalized citizenship is often used to mean any type of contemporary concept of citizenship which separates itself from the nation- state, however it alone means processes occurring within the borders of the nation-state. Postnational and transnational citizenship refer to new types of citizenship, such as citizenship of the European Union, which are outside of national borders and, although all concepts share some characteristics, denationalized citizenship does not require that citizenship be relocated to outside of the nation-state, as is central to postnational and transnational citizenship.Sassen, Saskia. Towards Post-National Citizenship.In: Isin, E. and Turner, B. (eds.) Handbook of Citizenship Studies. 2002. p. 278 Although denationalized citizenship can be associated with or caused by global and transnational processes, it occurs within the national and not outside of or across several nation-states.

In 2007 the company opened its first site abroad in Italy. Today MT-Energie operates throughout Europe and distributes its products and services in many countries worldwide. MT-Energie was founded in the German town of Rockstedt in the district of Rotenburg (Wümme). In November 2008 the company moved its premises to the small town of Zeven in Lower Saxony. There, on the premises of , the new headquarters including offices, logistics area and manufacturing buildings for gas processing plants were constructed. When MT-Energie released preliminary results for the 2012 financial year on 25 April 2013, they talked of a collapse of demand in the German market and the high costs of internationalisation, especially in Italy and the United States. MT-Energie has reduced the number of full-time employees in Italy from 40 to 15 and has pulled out of the US market. A company press release from earlier in the month (April 2, 2013) denied rumours of liquidity problems and imminent insolvency. The 2013 preliminary financial results were released on 30 June 2014 and they stated an expected loss of 23.3 million euros for the entire company. This loss is more than 25% of the expected company turnover of 87.7 million euros in the same period. MT-Energie has closed down the Australian, Canadian and US offices and pulled out of the North American and Australian markets completely. The company's only future involvement in North America will be completion of the already-begun projects in the USA. Due to the financial situation, all of the experienced country sales and project management directors were sacked or left the company, which leaves MT- Energie's foreign sales departments with inexperienced managers. MT-Energie also had a covenant breach on their 2012-issued company bond (Anleihe) due to owner's equity also falling to 4.1%. In order to avoid defaulting on their bonds, a deal was made with the bond holders. This low level of owner's equity also means that the banks offering credit can cancel their credit agreements with MT-Energie. The banks and MT-Energie are now negotiating to find a solution. Corporate social responsibility In winter 2010/11, MT-Energie offered the national archery team of the German Disabled Sports Association its Zeven storage and logistics centre for their preparations for the summer season. The team members included double Olympic medallist Mario Oehme as well as the incumbent runner-up world champions Michael Arenz and Michael Müller of the “compound team”.

He began playing Buzkashi at age 15. At the time that he began playing, Buzkashi was a rite of passage for young men in the Kunduz region. At the age of 18, he was conscripted by the military of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan during the Soviet–Afghan War. He soon defected from the government military to join the Mujahideen. Ahmad initially left Kabul and returned to Kunduz after the 1992 Civil war began. His playing skill soon drew the attention of Mohammed Fahim, who was then a powerful warlord. Fahim offered to sponsor him if he returned to play in Kabul and chartered a helicopter to bring him back. Ahmad remained in Kabul until leaving the city in 1996 shortly before it fell to the Taliban, who then banned buzkashi. He returned to the north and joined the Northern Alliance to fight against the Taliban in the ensuing Civil war.

She did her education at SMK Segambut Jaya (see Malaysian Wikipedia) in Segambut, Kuala Lumpur, and represented the Federal Territory in handball. During her school days, she was known as a tomboy, an image which she later chose to shed. She represented Malaysia in Miss Tourism International 2003 and placed Top 15. In 2004, Lee represented Malaysia in the Miss Chinese Cosmos beauty pageant. During the proceedings, she spoke Chinese rather stammeringly, which observers suggested could be a barrier to her carrying out her duties as title-holder; nevertheless, she went on to win the top prize. In media interviews following her victory, she stated that she hoped to become an actress. The following year, she entered Jinan University's Chinese Department as a short-term student to study Chinese. Her oral skills showed significant improvement compared to the Miss Chinese Cosmos proceedings, but she was still not able to read or write Chinese aside from her own name. She hoped that studying at Jinan University would help her to become literate in Chinese and appreciate Chinese culture. She returned to Malaysia in 2005. By 2007, she had appeared in two Chinese-language television series in Malaysia, and worked as a promotional model for Pepsi, Matsushita, and Sony.

Selected projects Recommendation for preventing wrong site surgery Based on international protocols four actions to prevent wrong-site surgery were defined: (1) asking the patient about his identity and the planned intervention, (2) marking the operation site with an indelible pen, (3) ensuring that the right patient is brought to the operating room, and (4) a “team timeout” of the operating team immediately before the intervention. Recommendation for establishing critical incident reporting systems (CIRS) in hospitals CIRS are voluntary reporting systems for hospital staff. Their purpose is to discover unsafe practices and to initiate safety measures before patients are harmed. APS published recommendations on how to establish CIRS in hospitals, and is partner of the German Hospital CIRS Network. Checklist for medication safety in hospitals A checklist with a graduated scheme to measure medication safety was published as a tool for any hospital to review common activities and projects to improve medication safety. Medication list for patients At the time of drug prescription doctors often do not have full information about all drugs taken by the patient. This provokes the incalculable risk of unwanted drug interactions and adverse events. APS therefore published a schedule for patients to list their medications.

She also set a league season record for the most double plays in 1948, and after moving to third base in 1952, she was the best fielder at her new position. As a fielder, she committed only 249 errors in 2411 total chances for a solid .943 career fielding average.All- American Girls Professional Baseball League Record Book – W. C. Madden.

Format: Paperback, 438pp. Language: English. Basically a slap hitter, Petras batted a modest .198 average in 834 career games, but she had the ability to get on base, by any means, way above than the pure ability to get the hit, reaching first base by walks, by a bunt single or being hit by the pitcher. A smart and aggressive baserunner, she collected 420 stolen bases, and also knew when to take the additional base on an overthrow – 71 of her 552 hits were for extra bases. A hard-to-strikeout hitter, she posted a solid 1.37 BB/K (342-to-249) in 2,790 at-bats.The Women of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League Petras entered the league in 1944 with the Milwaukee Chicks, appearing in 25 games as the primarily backup to incumbent shortstop Merle Keagle. With Max Carey at the helm, the Chicks went on to win the Championship Title, beating the Kenosha Comets in the best-of-seven series. Although the Chicks won the title, they had no local financial backing and could not compete with the American Association Milwaukee Brewers. Due to lack of community support and skepticism of journalists, the team moved to Grand Rapids, Michigan prior to the 1945 season.All-American Girls Professional Baseball League Record Book1944 Milwaukee Chicks In 1945, Keagle married and did not play for the new Grand Rapids Chicks, being replaced by Petras at shortstop. As an everyday player, Petras appeared in all games for Grand Rapids (110), as part of an infield that included Betty Whiting (1B), Alma Ziegler (2B) and Doris Tetzlaff (3B). Petras led all shortstops with a .918 fielding average, while hitting .162 with a team's second-best 29 runs batted in, five behind teammate Thelma Eisen. Incidentally, the relatively low batting averages from the 1943 season through 1947, before a smaller ball was introduced in 1948, reflect mainly the high quality of All-American League pitchers, rather than a lack of skills by the hitters. Third place Grand Rapids advanced to the playoffs, but lost in the best-of-five first round series to the Rockford Peaches.1945 Grand Rapids Chicks SABR Project –Betsy Jochum biography by Jim Sargent By 1946 Petras was a popular figure in Grand Rapids, where she made many close friends and received fan mail, which included a proposal of marriage. She improved to a .192 average, while playing in all games for the Chicks (112) and leading again the league in fielding average with a .951 mark. She also stole 53 bases, drove in 34 runs and scored 38 more. In the playoffs, it would be a replay of the previous season as the Chicks were overmatched by the Peaches in the best-of-five first round series.1946 Grand Rapids Chicks No Girls in the Clubhouse: The Exclusion of Women from Baseball – Marilyn Cohen.

For the third consecutive season, Petras played in all games for the Chicks and topped shortstops in fielding, this time with a .942 average. She also contributed with a .175 average, 45 runs, 25 RBI and 51 steals. Grand Rapids, managed by Johnny Rawlings, advanced to the final series after defeating the South Bend Blue Sox in the first round, three to two games. In the championship playoffs, Grand Rapids took a 3–1 advantage against the Racine Belles, but lost the next two games to send the series to a seventh game. Then, in a tough pitcher's duel, Grand Rapids' Mildred Earp beat Anna Mae Hutchison and the Belles, 1–0, to clinch the championship.1947 Grand Rapids Chicks Petras opened 1948 with the Chicks, but was dealt to the expansion Chicago Colleens during the midseason, as the league usually switched players as needed to help new teams to be competitive. When she was transferred to the new team, a public plea was written by the club president Nate Harkness to accept her departure. An enormous crowd attended her last game in a Chicks uniform, and she felt heartbroken to leave her loyal fans and the close playing relationship formed with second bagger Ziegler. In 108 games, Petras posted a combined .218 average and a .321 on-base percentage, driving in 32 runs and scoring 59 times, while stealing a career-high 86 bases to rank seventh in the league. She also turned in 48 double plays to achieve a single season record while collecting a .948 fielding average, No Girls in the Clubhouse For the next three years Petras became part of the Kenosha Comets. She averaged 49 stolen bases in each of these years, with a second-best career of 73 stolen bases in 1949 to rank second behind Racine's Sophie Kurys (137). She also amassed a .213 average and a .329 OBP in the same period, including a .231 average and 52 steals in 1951. Kenosha made the playoffs in 1950, losing the first round to Rockford three to one games.1949 Kenosha Comets1950 Kenosha Comets In 1952 Petras joined the Battle Creek Belles and made the transition to third base. She hit a career-high .233 with 42 stolen bases in 92 games, while leading all fielders with a .965 average.1952 Battle Creek Belles Following her baseball career, she made Barnegat Township, New Jersey her new home. Since 1988 Petras is part of Women in Baseball, a permanent display based at the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York, which was unveiled to honor the entire All-American Girls Professional Baseball League rather than individual baseball personalities. Then, in 2000 she and other surviving Milwaukee Chicks were honored by the Milwaukee Brewers Major League team before a game against the San Diego Padres. Tributes to the club may be found in Miller Park. Besides this, in 2002, during the Women's Equality Day, Petras and fellow AAGPBL player Jane Moffet were honored by New Jersey Governor Jim McGreevey prior to a Trenton Thunder minor league baseball game at Mercer County Waterfront Park.

This dicastery emerged from the Decree on the Lay Apostolate of the Second Vatican Council, Apostolicam Actuositatem.\\"Apostolicam Actuositatem\\" , Vatican.va, June 2012. It was officially created by Pope Paul VI on 6 January 1967, with the motu proprio Catholicam Christi Ecclesiam.\\"Catholicam Christi Ecclesiam\\", Vatican.va, June 2012. Canonical rights of the laity Within the Catholic Church, the rights of the Catholic laity in regards to the Church are found in the Code of Canon Law. A new Code of Canon Law was promulgated in 1983, to incorporate teachings from the Second Vatican Council. In particular, Canons 224-231 of the 1983 Code outline the general and specific canonical rights of lay persons in the Catholic Church.\\"The Code of Canon Law\\" , Vatican.va, June 2012. Lay ministries Prior to 1972, no lay ministries existed, only the minor orders and major orders. The minor orders were, in effect, the lower orders of the clerical state and were reserved for those preparing for the priesthood: Acolyte, Exorcist, Lector or reader, and Ostiarius or porter. As a result of the reforms of the Second Vatican Council, on 15 August 1972 Pope Paul VI issued the Motu Proprio Ministeria Quaedam which in effect suppressed the minor orders and replaced them with two ministries, those of lector and acolyte. A major difference was: \\"Ministries may be assigned to lay Christians; hence they are no longer to be considered as reserved to candidates for the sacrament of orders.\\" The following are requirements for admission to the ministries: * the presentation of a petition that has been freely made out and signed by the aspirant to the Ordinary (the bishop and, in clerical institutes, the major superior) who has the right to accept the petition; * a suitable age and special qualities to be determined by the conference of bishops; * a firm will to give faithful service to God and to the Christian people. The ministries are conferred by the Ordinary through the liturgical rites De institutione lectoris and De institutione acolythi as revised by the Apostolic See. An interval, determined by the Holy See or the conferences of bishops, shall be observed between the conferring of the ministries of reader and acolyte whenever more than one ministry is conferred on the same person.\\" However, \\"In accordance with the ancient tradition of the Church, institution to the ministries of reader and acolyte is reserved to men.\\" Due to this reservation these ministries are rarely formally instituted in many regions of the Catholic Church. In their place has evolved the widespread use of commissioned readers, altar servers and extraordinary ministers of the Eucharist as these functions can be undertaken by both men and women. Conditions for the extension of these roles can be found in The General Instruction of the Roman Missal. In relation to readers, Instruction #101 says: \\"In the absence of an instituted lector, other laypersons may be commissioned to proclaim the readings from Sacred Scripture. They should be truly suited to perform this function and should receive careful preparation, so that the faithful by listening to the readings from the sacred texts may develop in their hearts a warm and living love for Sacred Scripture.\\" As regards altar servers and extraordinary ministers of the Eucharist Instruction #100 says: \\"In the absence of an instituted acolyte, lay ministers may be deputed to serve at the altar and assist the priest and the deacon; they may carry the cross, the candles, the thurible, the bread, the wine, and the water, and they may also be deputed to distribute Holy Communion as extraordinary ministers.\\" It is worth noting that an option to institute the other minor orders was retained in this document, in that a Bishops Conference may request permission from the Apostolic See \\"if they judge the establishment of such offices in their region to be necessary or very useful because of special reasons. To these belong, for example, the ministries of porter, exorcist, catechist, as well as others to be conferred on those who are dedicated to works of charity, where this ministry had not been assigned to deacons.\\" Lay councils = Powers and influence of the laity = The 1983 Code of Canon Law does not permit the laity to have any kind of executive or juridical powers in Ecclesiastical affairs. This curtails the extent of influence the laity has over how the Church is governed on a day-to-day basis. However, lay experts and advisors were appointed to participate during the deliberations of the Second Vatican Council. After the Council members of the Laity were routinely appointed to sit on Commissions & Committees established at every level – Curial, Bishops Conference, Diocesan, Deanery, and Parish. Each parish is advised to have a parish council and a finance council of laypersons which are advisory to the pastor. = National Council for Lay Associations (England & Wales) = The National Council for Lay Associations (NCLA) was the idea of the late Monsignor Derek Worlock, who later became Archbishop of Liverpool, England. It became one of the Consultative Bodies of the Bishops' Conference in England & Wales and was formed from all the large Catholic lay organizations. The NCLA was initially called the National Lay Apostolic Group and was formed after the First World Congress for the Apostolate of the Laity held in Rome in October 1951. In 2003 the NCLA celebrated its 50th birthday with a Golden Jubilee Mass in Salford Cathedral. The NCLA today is a consultative body to the Catholic Bishops Conference of England & Wales. The following members form the association. NCLA Member Associations include Catholic Menʼs Society (CMS), Catholic Association Teachers, Schools and Colleges St Vincent de Paul (SVP) Union of Catholic Mothers (UCM) Catholic Womenʼs League (CWC) Knights of St Columba (KSC) National Board of Catholic Women (NBCW) Ascent Movement National Justice and Peace Newman Association CAFOD Legion of Mary Catholic Peopleʼs Weeks Catholic Medical Association Secular Franciscans The NCLA is an active member of ELF (European Lay Forum) = The National Council of the Laity (Venezuela) = One country where a Council of the Laity appears to be thriving is Venezuela. The National Council of the Laity (Consejo Nacional de Laicos) in Venezuela routinely issues statements and press releases often criticising the policies of the current President Hugo Chávez. = The Council of the Catholic Lay Apostolate Organizations of Korea = The Council of the Catholic Lay Apostolate Organizations of Korea, formerly The Catholic Lay Apostolate Council of Korea, was renamed during the 2010 Autumn General Assembly of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of Korea. This was ratified at the 44th Ordinary General Meeting of the Council which was held at the Catholic Center in Myeongdong, Seoul, on 19 February 2011. Lay Congresses = The National Pastoral Congress (England & Wales) = Archbishop Derek Worlock, supported by the late Archbishop of Westminster Cardinal Basil Hume, convened the National Pastoral Congress in Liverpool, England in 1980. The Congress consisted of some two-thousand lay people. The Congress deliberated on issues that the gathering agreed were of particular concern to lay Catholics in England & Wales at that time. The results of these deliberations were drawn together in a document entitled \\"The Easter People\\". This document was very publicly rejected by Pope John Paul II when it was presented to him by Cardinal Hume and Archbishop Worlock in Rome, Italy, in 1980. There has not been another National Pastoral Congress since this time in England & Wales. Lay organizations There are many thousands of Catholic lay organisations existing at a local, diocesan, national / bishops conference or international level. They cover the whole spectrum of Catholic lay life, from their faith and social action to the professions in which they work. The majority have sought and been given backing by the appropriate ecclesiastical authority. However, others have invoked the right contained in Canon 215 to form a Catholic Association without ecclesiastical approval. In these circumstances the only prescription on them is that they cannot use the term \\"Catholic\\" in their name (Can. 216). The Pontifical Council for the Laity is the body responsible for approving those Catholic Associations that exist at an international level..International Lay Associations The structure of some Religious Orders allows for lay branches to be associated with them. These are sometimes referred to as Third Orders. Some of the best known Catholic lay organizations are Knights of Columbus, Knights of Columba, Catenians, and Knights of Malta. There are also many lay Catholic guilds and associations representing a whole range of professions. These include the Catholic Police Guild, Holy Name Society (NYPD), the Association of Catholic Nurses, the Guild of Catholic Doctors, the Catholic Phyicians Guild, the Catholic Association of Performing Arts (UK), and the Catholic Actors Guild of America. In the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, the Queen of Angels Foundation was established in 2011 by Mark Anchor Albert. The Foundation, an association of lay faithful dedicated to fostering devotion to Mary, Mother of Jesus, is a volunteer group of lay men and women who \\"...strive together in a common endeavor to foster a more perfect life for themselves and their community by promoting reverence for the Blessed Virgin Mary, in whose name, as Our Lady of the Angels, the City and Archdiocese of Los Angeles were founded...\\" and whom Catholics revere as Queen of Heaven and Empress of the Americas. The Queen of Angels Foundation is the official sponsor of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles' annual celebration of the City of Los Angeles' founding. This Votive Mass & Grand Marian Procession take place in Downtown Los Angeles on the last Saturday of August. Personal prelatures Organisations such as Opus Dei and Miles Jesu are ostensibly Catholic lay organisations which are overseen by clergy associated and / or affiliated with them. The structure of these organisations is termed a \\"personal prelature\\". Lay advocacy groups In recent years many lay advocacy groups have formed, some in response to the clerical sex abuse crisis. Reforms advocated by these groups would include: * the binding of the Catholic Hierarchy to a universal and comprehensive system of transparency and accountability relating to their governance of the Church; * the mandatory empowerment of the laity to a degree of oversight and scrutiny at every level of the Church – local, diocesan, provincial, national / bishops conference, international, dicastery; * automatic consultative and collaborative rights for the laity at every level of the Church; * increased lay access to and involvement with ministry within the Church; * freedom of speech and an end of censorship. Lay media =Web content= Lay Catholics have contributed to Catholic media online in such avenues as blogs, online columns, and newspapers. The Vatican hosted a conference of bloggers on 2 May 2011. This was sponsored jointly by the Pontifical Council for Culture and the Pontifical Council for Social Communications. One hundred and fifty bloggers were invited from across the world. Richard Rouse, an English layman who works for the Pontifical Council for Culture, has stated that this meeting was not held in any attempt by the Vatican to control Catholic blogs. He has also stated that there will not be another Vatican Blogmeet, but individual Diocese may hold similar conferences.The Catholic Herald, London, August 5th 2011, \\"The Vatican doesn't want to control blogs\\", p. 7 =Lay newspapers= There are many Catholic newspapers and periodicals produced around the world by lay Catholics, which are independent of the Church hierarchy. Examples in the United Kingdom are The Catholic Herald and The Tablet. In the United States the Catholic Reporter is entirely a work of the laity and the National Catholic Register, a subsidiary of EWTN, is run by laypersons. Secular newspapers such as The Boston Globe and The Daily Telegraph are also heavy in Catholic content. =Lay spokespeople= Mathew Ahmann, Catholic layman and speaker during the March on Washington, behind Martin Luther King, Jr. Recently, laypeople have started to act as public spokespersons for the Church in both official and unofficial capacities. One such example was the foundation of Catholic Voices by Opus Dei in preparation for the visit of Pope Benedict XVI to the United Kingdom in 2010. The group has since been made a permanent part of their work and expanded to other countries. Primarily focusing on young Catholic professionals, it provides them with training to talk to the media about events happening within the Catholic Church. It has been replicated in Spain and in Germany where it is known as Catholic Faces. Other countries where interest in such an effort has emerged are Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Costa Rica, and the United States.The Catholic Herald, London, August 5th 2011, \\"Catholic Voices inspires groups across Europe ahead of papal visits\\", p. 1 Clericalism Clericalism might be described as any attempt to exaggerate the importance of the priesthood as a focus of power and privilege. It was described by a bishop at Vatican II as one of the three main evils that had typified the Church in the previous centuries. Some would say that it accompanies a new wave of traditionalism that grew during the pontificate of John-Paul II. In April 2011, during a conference in Milwaukee, United States, on the clergy child sex abuse scandal, the Archbishop of Dublin Diarmuid Martin said: \\"There are signs of a new clericalism, which may even at times be ably veiled behind appeals for deeper spirituality or for more orthodox theological positions.\\" Martin added that he planned to require all seminarians to \\"carry out some part of their formation with lay people so that they can establish mature relationships with men and women and not develop any sense of their priesthood giving them a special social position.\\" Pope Francis has endeavored in many ways to lift up the laity in the Church, with \\"continual blasting of clericalism and his references to the “one, holy People of God'.\\" He declared that the \\"hour of the laity\\" has arrived and decried clericalism as rife in the Church, saying that it \\"leads to the functionalization of the laity, From the start of his papacy Francis referred to the laity as \\"missionary disciples\\" with an apostolate of their own, submissive to but not requiring the direction of the hierarchy. Clericalism has been viewed as a barrier to improving lay rights and greater access to positions of supervision, oversight, and administration in the Church, as well as to increased involvement in Church ministry. A classic example of clericalism comes from Monsignor George Talbot in 1867, in his critique of the position of John Henry Newman in his article \\"On Consulting the Faithful in Matters of Doctrine\\",On Consulting the Faithful in Matters of Doctrine, July 1859 which was published in the Rambler in July 1859. Talbot is quoted as saying to Henry Edward Manning, Archbishop of Westminster: John Henry Newman was a proponent of increased Catholic lay involvement in the life of the Church. After publishing \\"On Consulting...\\" Newman was looked upon with grave suspicion and distrust by many of the Catholic hierarchy in England and Wales, and in Rome where Talbot had worked in the Papal Curia. Newman was made a Cardinal by Pope Leo XIII in 1879; Talbot, whose \\"notorious want of judgment\\" was noted by the biographer C. Butler, died in an asylum at Passy near Paris in 1886. Talbot had asked Newman \\"Who are the laity?\\" to which Newman responded that \\"the Church would look foolish without them.\\" See also * Associations of the faithful * Catechism of the Catholic Church * Catholic Catechist * Index of Vatican City-related articles * Popular piety * Lay ecclesial ministry * List of Ecclesial movements * Universal call to holiness * Vocational Discernment in the Catholic Church * Queen of Angels Foundation References External links * The Code of Canon Law ","title":"Catholic laity"},{"id":"31488308","text":"Jonathan David Gray (born 15 July 1967) is an English cricketer.

OU Medicine focuses on improving health by collaboration, searching for innovation and encouraging high performance. OU Medical Center Presbyterian Tower at OU Medical Center.OU Medical Center is located in central Oklahoma City on the University of Oklahoma Health Science Center campus, just east of downtown Oklahoma City and south of the State Capitol building. The main OU Medical Center building which houses the main hospital is Presbyterian Tower, which had been the Presbyterian Hospital. In 2010 OU Medical Center celebrated its 100th anniversary. OU Medical Center has 680 beds. Most of OU Medical Center's and the Children's Hospital-affiliated physicians are a part of OU Physicians and faculty with the OU College of Medicine and see patients in over 60 adult and child specialties. OU Medical Center is home to Oklahoma's only Level One Trauma center as verified by the American College of Surgeons. The trauma center is located on the west side of Presbyterian Tower, and houses four Medi Flight transports which can be seen on the helipad from Lincoln Boulevard. Unique services at OU Medical Center include comprehensive cancer care including a Gamma Knife Center for treating brain tumors that can't be treated by conventional methods, a Bone Marrow Transplant Center and Oklahoma's newest and largest Radiation Therapy Center. OU Medical Center also houses the Oklahoma Transplant Center. On February 1, 2018, OU Medicine became a locally owned and managed nonprofit.  OU Medical Center Edmond  Recently renovated OU Medical Center Edmond campus. OU Medical Center Edmond is located in central Edmond, Oklahoma just east of the University of Central Oklahoma campus. Until April 2010, OU Medical Center Edmond was known as Edmond Medical Center. OU Medical Center Edmond primarily serves the people of Edmond in northern Oklahoma County, and southern Logan County. In 2010, the hospital began a $17 million expansion and renovation. Construction includes renovation to reintroduction the much anticipated maternal child services back into Edmond. Other updates include expansion to the Emergency Department, internal and external facelifts, and new diagnostic and surgical equipment.  The Children’s Hospital at OU Medical Center  The Children's Hospital at OU Medical Center as seen from the center of the OUHSC campus. The Children's Hospital at OU Medical Center is located in central Oklahoma City on the OUHSC campus. It is Oklahoma's only full-service pediatric medical care facility. In April 2011, the Atrium was opened to the public and now serves as the main entrance to the Children's Hospital. The Emergency Room entrance was moved to N.E. 13th Street. The newly opened Atrium serving as the main entrance to The Children's Hospital and OU Children's Physicians. The Children's Hospital affiliates physicians practice as part of OU Children's Physicians and work in over 50 pediatric specialties. The Children's Hospital is home to the Women's and Newborn Center, which is known for its high risk specialty care for mothers and newborns. The Women's and Newborn Center is home to the only midwifery service in a central Oklahoma hospital and the only comprehensive lactation service in Oklahoma. It also offers a wide range of prenatal courses and classes. In 2010, the Pediatric Urology Department at The Children's Hospital was ranked as the 14th best Urology Department in the nation by U.S. News & World Report. And, the Stroke Center at OU Medical Center was awarded the Gold Seal of Approval from The Joint Commission for Primary Stroke Centers.  OU Physicians  The OU Physicians Building. OU Physicians sees most of their adult patients at this location. OU Physicians is the clinical practice of the University of Oklahoma College of Medicine, and affiliated physician group for OU Medical Center. OU Physicians office in several different buildings on the Health Sciences Center campus. Some of the physicians office in the OU Physicians Building constructed in 2001. OU Physicians also have offices in other areas of Oklahoma City, along with Edmond, Enid, Tulsa and other cities around the state. With more than 475 doctors and other health care providers, OU Physicians is the largest physician group in Oklahoma. Since the creation of its College of Medicine in the early 1900s, OU's academic health faculty has cared for patients as well as pioneering new treatments through research. In the early 1990s, College of Medicine leadership charted a vision for an expanded role in patient care. As a not-for-profit institution, revenues from this clinical practice fund the teaching and research aspects of the college. Growth in these revenues would enable the college to significantly strengthen the facilities, staff, breadth and renown of the OU College of Medicine. Based upon this, the faculty practice plan was established in July 1991. Thus, leadership and many functional operations changed from a department-based model to a multi-specialty group practice with a shared management team, governance and standards, managed care contracting and marketing. The group shared the name University Physicians Medical Group from 1996 to 2001, when it was renamed OU Physicians. = OU Children's Physicians = The OU Children's Physicians Building. OU Children's Physicians sees most of their adult patients at this location. The Atrium can be seen on the right which connects to the Children's Hospital. OU Children's Physicians has more than 150 doctors in over 50 child specialties. The majority of these doctors are board certified in child specialties and many of them offer child-specific services that are unavailable elsewhere in Oklahoma. Some have even pioneered surgical procedures or innovations in patient care that are world firsts. Thirteen OU Children's Physicians hold Children's Medical Research Institute (CMRI) Endowed Chairs. Through endowed programs, CMRI helps fund the research and education efforts of leading pediatric doctors at the OU Health Sciences Center. OU Children's Physicians specialists care for everyday conditions and for ongoing or complex health conditions. These specialists include: * More pediatric cardiologists than any other practice in the state * The state's only comprehensive pediatric care for types 1 and 2 diabetes * The only two pediatric neurosurgeons in Oklahoma City * The only pediatric surgeons in south and central Oklahoma * The only pediatric stem cell transplantation team in the state * The only comprehensive bleeding disorders program in the state * The only team in the state caring for children who have kidney transplants * Board-certified, fellowship-trained pediatric urologists, one of whom pioneered urological tissue engineering to create functional bladders  Stephenson Cancer Center  The Stephenson Cancer Center, formerly known as the OU Cancer Institute, is located on the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center campus in Oklahoma City. Under the guidance of Robert Mannel, MD, Director, the mission of the Cancer Center is to promote and support cancer research, education, care, and patient support for Oklahomans and beyond. Members of the Stephenson Cancer Center—including faculty from University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, OU Norman, OU Tulsa, Oklahoma State University, Oklahoma City University, University of Central Oklahoma, Northeastern State University, and the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation conduct innovative and nationally funded cancer research in the basic, clinical and population sciences. Regardless of expertise or home institution, all members of the Stephenson Cancer Center share a common goal: reducing the morbidity and mortality caused by cancer in Oklahoma and beyond. In 2002, the National Cancer Institute awarded the SCC a P20 Planning Grant to lay the groundwork for Oklahoma's first and only NCI-Designated Cancer Center. Achieving this designation, the gold standard for cancer research and care in the United States, will mean that Oklahomans will no longer need to travel out-of-state for comprehensive, state-of-the-art cancer care. Oklahoma moved one step closer to NCI-Designation in November 2004, when state voters approved State Question 713, which restructured and increased the tax on tobacco products. Revenues from this tax are targeted for a number of health care initiatives, including the construction of a $120 million cancer clinical research and treatment facility in Oklahoma City and smaller facility in Tulsa. The new facility in Oklahoma City opened in July 2011, and serves as a major cancer resource for cancer patients, investigators and health professionals from around the state and across the nation. The building offers patients and families everything needed under one roof, including the most experienced and largest number of cancer specialists, the most advanced technology and a unique environment intended to reduce the \\"clinical feel\\" of most out-patient medical facilities. The Stephenson Cancer Center provides out-patient services to adults (although pediatric patients are treated with radiation therapy in the building), and patients are admitted to the OU Medical Center if they require hospitalization. In 2006, the University of Oklahoma launched a $50 million private fundraising campaign to create endowed chairs and establish programs in cancer research and clinical care. The campaign goal was met when Tulsa residents Peggy and Charles Stephenson pledged $12 million to support the Cancer Center, then the largest gift ever to the OU Health Sciences Center.

He became a life peer as Baron Nash, of Ewelme in the County of Oxfordshire on 21 January 2013.Lord Nash New Lords He and his wife have donated almost £300,000 to the Conservative Party and according to the Telegraph, the appointment raises concern about a potential conflict of interest and appointment of donors though the Department for Education said he would not make business decisions whilst in office. In April, Labour councillors called for an inquiry after the new Pimlico primary school where Nash was co-chairman of the governors appointed an unqualified teacher as headmistress ahead of its opening in September. Further criticism followed when she resigned after four weeks in the job. In March 2014, the Conservative minister rejected the council bid for Holborn and St Pancras building a post- comprehensive school, called a \\"university training school\\", but promised only to build them in Cambridge and Birmingham. In October 2016, following a backlash from schools and parents and the national boycott of the school census expansion, he wrote that newly collected pupils’ nationality and country of birth data would not be included in the National Pupil Database (NPD). In a letter to peers seen by Schools Week, Nash defended the sharing of pupil address and school data with the Home Office, but admitted the new information called for a different approach, saying, \\"given the sensitivity of the new information being collected we will not add this to the NPD, so no-one outside the department will be able to access it.\\" Members of the House of Lords went on to oppose the change in law in a debate and motion-of-regret, which was tabled by the Liberal Democrat education spokesperson Lord Storey. On 31 October 2016 the House of Lords agreed after debate, with the regret motion on the expansion of the collection of pupil data: “That this House regrets that information about pupils’ nationality and country of birth collected under the Education (Pupil Information) (England) (Miscellaneous Amendments) Regulations 2016 (Statutory Instrument 2016/808)[3] could be used to help determine a child’s immigration status.” Lord Nash resigned from government on 28 September 2017 and was replaced by Sir Theodore Agnew DL as an unpaid Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Department for Education.

The magazine was founded in 1995 by J.T. Publishing, a South African subsidiary of the American Hustler. It was the first Afrikaans-language pornographic publication. Launched only one year after the end of apartheid, the magazine was greatly controversial as it posed a clear opposition to the conservative Afrikaner nationalist morals that influenced the apartheid government's censorship of media History During South Africa's apartheid, the ruling Afrikaner dominated National Party enacted strict censorship over media. Publications were censored or banned for raising political criticism against the party. Also, the government censored any material that contradicted their moral values. Conservative Afrikaner moral values derived from Dutch Calvinism, which repressed sexual desires and advocated abstinence and chastity as forms of purity. The title of the magazine itself, Loslyf, clearly opposes these values, translating in Afrikaans to \\"loose body/morals.\\" Loslyf’s first editor, Ryk Hattingh, was no stranger to controversy, as he had previously worked as sub-editor under Max du Preez for the anti-apartheid newspaper Vrye Weekblad. Through the magazine, Hattingh wished to redefine the dominant perception of Afrikaner people and culture. He claimed, \\"Afrikaners have always been portrayed as khaki-klad repressed people and I wanted to show them as normal, sexual f*ing human beings!\\" The first issue hit the shelves in June 1995 and featured the antagonistic and controversial spread \\"Dina at the Monument.\\" The spread featured a model posing topless in front of the Voortrekker Monument. In 1949 the National Party dedicated the monument to the Voortrekkers who participated in the Great Trek. Scholars have argued that by photographing the nude model before a symbol of Afrikaner nationalism, Loslyf presents a direct opposition to the party and its values that gave rise to the censorship of the media. The issue was immensely popular, selling approximately 80,000 copies total. Under Hattingh's management, the magazine took on a critical tone. Along with the nude spreads, Loslyf also featured a number of intellectual articles from well-known and respected writers. It also contained controversial political cartoons by Joe Dog and Konradski of Bitterkomix. Contemporary content Since its debut, Loslyf readership has levelled out to around 20,000 copies sold per issue. This has been attributed to its loss of novelty factor. Also, after coming under the management of editor Karen Eloff, the magazine's first female editor, the magazine has changed direction toward a more sexually oriented magazine, dropping its critical and intellectual features. She claims that \\"people buy Loslyf because of the sex, and there is a place for everything, but Loslyf is just not the place for intellectual stories.\\" However, readership did increase by 30% following Eloff becoming editor and posing nude within the magazine in a 2005 issue. The magazine has also expanded to include a website. Recent controversies Namibian-born Afrikaans singer Juanita du Plessis sued the magazine for \\"doctoring\\" a picture of her and including a vulgar headline insinuating that she was addicted to oral sex in the October 2004 issue. Du Plessis made a R200,000 defamation claim against the magazine. In 2007 the Pretoria High Court ruled in favour of Du Plessis and J.T. Publishers was forced to pay her R60,000. In December 2004, Loslyf published an image of a woman's breast and claimed it to be that of local South African singer- celebrity Amor Vittone. Inside the magazine, there also appeared six other photos of breasts with captions implying that they were Vittone's. Following the issue's publication, Vitonne denied that any of the photos were legitimate and filed a R1,000,000 lawsuit against the magazine. The publisher eventually publicly apologised, pulled from issue from the shelves, and privately agreed to compensate Vitonne. In 2005, a Loslyf reader was removed from a Nationwide Airlines flight for refusing to put away the magazine. After being told he was not allowed to read the magazine on the plane, businessman A.C. Hoffman bluntly refused and was eventually removed before takeoff. This raised controversy particularly because Hoffman had purchased the issue within the airport. The magazine abides by the rules regarding explicit content set out by the national Film and Production Board. Though, as Eloff claims, it is about sex, the magazine refrains from depicting images of sexual intercourse as well as other sexually explicit acts. This allows the magazine to be sold at cafés and airports, not only in sex shops.

In a bid to resuscitate public education in its state, the Kwara State Government under the leadership of Governor Bukola Saraki introduced a package of extensive reforms in the education sector. These reforms are also called the Education Charter for Kwara State, and were designed to put \\"children at the heart of education\\" in the state. History Pupils at a public elementary school in Kwara Prior to the introduction of the reforms, public education was in dire straits in Kwara, as in many states in Nigeria. The quality of instruction in public schools was abysmally low. Enrollment in public schools dwindled, as parents (including the very poor) only took their wards to public schools when they could not afford the fee- paying private schools. Beginning from 2007, however, efforts were taken by the Kwara State Government to reverse the slide. With strong political support from the state governor, the Kwara State Commissioner for Education, Science and Technology, Bolaji Abdullahi, introduced some interventions that would redefine the education landscape in the state. To incentivize and track learning in public schools, the state government decided that a benchmark ought to be created to measure the progress of children in public schools. The state also recognized that in order to have greater involvement and buy-in from the parents and guardians of the school children, there was a need for an accountability mechanism to help them monitor the progress of their children. To determine the capacity of teachers to impart knowledge on their pupils, a test based on grade 4 curriculum was administered to the politically powerful primary school teachers in Kwara public schools. The majority of the teachers failed the test. As a result, massive training was held for all the teachers and teaching manuals were developed to guide the teachers. After discovering that most pupils lack basic literacy and numeracy skills, the state government also decided to reduce the number of subjects taught to students to ensure that more emphasis is placed on the ability of the pupils to read and write as well as undertake basic sums. Benchmarks were created for the evaluation of the new curriculum which focuses on literacy and numeracy. These were distributed to the teachers and the parents. Four pillars of reform Lesson manuals for teachers The Kwara State Every Child Counts education reform is aimed at providing quality education in public schools in the state. As enunciated by the state government, the reform revolves around answering the following questions: * When we put children in schools, what do you expect them to be able to do? * How well are children learning in schools? * How do we ensure that children learn effectively in our schools? Based on a review of the situation on the ground and to ensure that proper learning is taking place in its public schools, the state government build the reform around four pillars. These are: :1.Teaching quality improvement This is to ensure regular, structured assessment for teachers complemented by professional development courses for them to improve their skills. It is also designed to ensure that the curriculum continually remains relevant and is tailored to match the needs of local children. :2.Inspectorate development Setting and maintaining a high standard of education is at the core of Every Child Counts. A clear set of quality assurance standards will be devised for every school, both public and private. Schools will be supported to develop systems to assess their own quality as well as evaluate their own needs. :3.The College of Education turn- around Improve the capacity of Colleges of Education to produce the right quality of teachers needed. Update the curriculum of the College of in line with the current demands of teaching in primary schools. :4.Institution building Execute series of capacity building activities at the ministry of Education, Science and Technology, the state Universal Basic Education and the Teaching Service Commission. Strengthen the State Education Management Information System (EMIS) to enable the state to collate, retrieve, deploy and employ data on education in the state. Impact Every Child Counts prioritises the educational needs of children. Its focus is on the ability of children to, at the minimum, be able to read and write and be able to do basic arithmetic. The retraining of teachers and the introduction of the teaching manuals for all teachers ensure that teachers are capable of taking charge of the classroom and delivering quality education to the children. The introduction of a detailed benchmark for monitoring the performance of the children, allows parents the opportunity to be a part of the learning process taking place and to engage their children. The bold step taken by Kwara State to revitalise public education is endorsed as best practice by the federal authorities and the donor community in Nigeria.

Plot  A young teenage girl named Julie is babysitting a younger child named Dorothy whilst the parents are out by themselves. Dorothy interrupts Julie's phone conversation with her friend, telling her she needs more money and so is babysitting. After hearing the child yell, she comes up to her bedroom and reassures her she has just had a nightmare. In the child's room, a pile of dolls and teddy bears are clearly noticed, including a large patchwork rabbit. Throughout the night, the teenager flicks through random TV channels and paints her nails, obviously bored with her job. A news report is informing viewers of a criminal breaking out of a mental institute, but she ignores the show and nearly falls asleep. She wakes to apparently see a red balloon and too Dorothy next to the sofa, looking terrifying, but realises she has just woken up. Another scream is heard from Dorothy's room, who is now standing up in her bed, pointing at the rabbit from the pile of toys. Julie impatiently tucks her back into bed and tells her she has nothing to be scared of, it is just a doll. Once in the landing, she phones a woman, supposedly Dorothy's mother, to ask whether the girl has had any trouble sleeping before and to question her on why she is so anxious of her toy rabbit. The mother has no idea what she is talking about because Dorothy has never had a large toy rabbit of which Julie has just described. A horrified Julie gasps and struggles to speak, her eyes flickering upstairs as the rabbit in the bedroom shuffles the other smaller toys off. The eyes snap open and it is shown that the \\"toy\\" is in fact a human intruder. Julie runs down the stairs and out of the house into the pouring rain, sobbing hysterically. She calls the police and is even more distraught when Dorothy seems to be smothered by a figure from the bedroom window. Julie tiptoes back into the house, a powercut turning everything pitch black. She tries to conceal her heavy breathing until she is more calm. Glancing into the landing, she sees a red balloon floating in the air. Dorothy is sitting on the floor and with her hands over her eyes, appearing to be playing an innocent 'hide and seek' game. She is unfazed by the situation and clearly is unaware to Julie's panic. Julie gently kneels in front of her and quietly whispers that mummy and daddy are outside. In the background, a looming figure saunters towards the two. Dorothy points and says \\"Alister\\", going back to the news report, stating that Alister Radford was the dangerous inmate who had broken out of the institution. We also see the family home's gate, spelling out \\"Radford\\" on the sign attached to it. Speechless, Julie realises that the child knows the intruder (he is possibly her father or brother) that he is also right behind her. He attacks and she screams for a while, obviously fighting him off but he is much stronger and powerful. From the eyes of Julie laying on the floor, the intruder takes the hand of a naive Dorothy and leads her away. It is assumed that Julie has been violently killed.

The pair, along with their five employees, ran the company from the garage of their home for a year before moving operations to an industrial park. The business acquired its first national buyer in the form of The Container Store in April 1995 and entered the sporting goods market when they were picked up by Dick’s Sporting Goods later that year. Since then, the company has enjoyed steady growth and was nominated as one of Colorado’s top small businesses in 2010 by ColoradoBiz Magazine.

Products =Polar Bottle= From left to right: The original Polar Bottle; the addition of a removable valve and screen-printed logo (in 20- and 24-ounce sizes); the bottle redesign; and modern bottles (in 20- and 24-ounce sizes). The Polar Bottle was invented by Robert Heiberger, with prototypes being made as early as 1989. Heiberger, a mechanical engineer working with heat loss in the medical technology design field, realized that the systems he employed to warm blood samples to body temperature could be used in reverse to keep liquid cool in a bottle. The bottle features a dual- wall construction which creates a layer of insulating air between the liquid inside the bottle and the outside environment. Between the two bottle layers is a thin foil liner that reflects solar energy away from the bottle. The bottle is – and has always been – made from BPA- and Phthalate-free Low- density polyethylene. It is produced in 24-ounce (710 ml) and 20-ounce (590 ml) sizes. The bottles are blow-molded in Denver, CO. Since the Polar Bottle’s introduction, it has undergone continual improvements to both form and function. The first of these changes occurred in 1998 when a removable valve system was added to the cap to facilitate cleaning. In 2006, the bottle’s entire aesthetic was updated with a sleeker body design, the addition of a carrying strap, and the introduction of a variety of colored liners. In 2010, the company added 8 new graphic designs to their existing array of colored liners and, in response to consumer feedback, reduced the thickness of the bottle walls to make squeezing the bottle easier. =Half Twist= Half Twist bottles in Stainless Steel and plastic (HDPE) varieties The Half Twist bottle was introduced in 2010 in an effort to expand the scope of Product Architects’ hydration options beyond the sports bottle market. The primary feature of the bottle is the Half Twist cap, which is fitted with a silicone gasket. The lid allows the user to drink directly from the cap without removing it from the bottle and the gasket creates a watertight seal when closed. The Half Twist received positive reviews, though some users found the lid difficult to operate. The lid comes on two types of bottles: a 24-ounce (710 ml) High- density polyethylene bottle and a 28-ounce (828 ml) Stainless steel bottle. Both bottle types are BPA- and Phthalate-free. =Modern Wallet= The “Wings” and “Prairie” Modern Wallet designs Product Architects released the Modern Wallet in 2004. The wallet was made of Teslin, a synthetic material that is durable, flexible, breathable, and waterproof. It featured a wide variety of pictures and designs that were shown on both the inside and outside of the wallet. It was sold primarily to Independent Bicycle Dealers, many of whom already carried the Polar Bottle. The Modern Wallet was discontinued in 2008.

The game is partially inspired by the Warcraft III custom map, Defense of the Ancients. Development A team of developers was assembled, primarily staff previously experienced in outsourcing but not in a start-to-finish development of a project. Development was wholly done in Shanghai, with player support, server operation and company administration based at the parent company in Yinzhou DistrictNingbo. The main server was opened to the public on 30 October 2010, just over two years after the project started. Alpha testing began in North America on the April 7, 2011. Realm of the Titans uses the BigWorld engine, which was originally designed for Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games presenting some issues of adapting both the client and the server to handle the very different requirements. Development was started in 2008 soon after CEO Qian Wenhai and Lead Designer Zhou Weifeng returned to China after studying in Melbourne, Australia. At University, both had become quite prominent in the Australian DOTA player base and had both previously qualified for the Asia-Pacific championship in Singapore. At this point in time, there were few commercial games released using this formula (although many Starcraft and Warcraft III maps existed such as Aeon of Strife), but they decided it had the potential to be a commercial genre. This proved to be correct as multiple games of this type were released while RotT was being developed such as League of Legends and Heroes of Newerth. RotT is the first title from developer Ningbo Shengguang Tianyi, which is a division of Qian's father's industrial conglomerate Ningbo Shengguang Industries. Gameplay The gameplay is similar to Defense of the Ancients, wherein players battle in three lanes to accumulate experience and gold. Characters have four skills which may be upgraded after gaining experience. In addition, there is a fifth skill which is not tied to character selection or experience; it can be changed every three minutes and becomes more potent every ten. It becomes a way to either supplement a character's weakness or complement its strength and can be switched as the game changes phase. There are 25 of these skills and may be active or passive in nature. Another unique addition is the four bosses, four huge and unique NPCs in the four corners of the map. If the enemy bosses are killed, the player's own boss will charge down the center lane in the way that a normal \\"creep\\" NPC would. As of 13 April 2018 there are 168 heroes in the Chinese version with new heroes added regularly. Matchmaking is done by the average rating of the players in a team, rating is calculated by wins and losses as well as personal contributions to those results. Players are put into a match fitting certain conditions such as a similar rating (depending on the number of players online), the same ISP (China only), and that the number of teams on both sides may differ by at most one (therefore a side containing one team of 5 players may only battle another team of five, a team of four plus a lone player or a team of three plus a team of two). Reception Realm of the Titans was received positively in China. It was particularly praised for its game balance, playability and production values. At the time of writing, Realm of the Titans has not yet received any official reviews in the West.

There is also a combined clinical classification, which combines factors such as age, risk factors for certain microorganisms, the presence of underlying lung disease or systemic disease and whether the person has recently been hospitalized. By location acquired =Community-acquired= Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is infectious pneumonia in a person who has not recently been hospitalized. CAP is the most common type of pneumonia. The most common causes of CAP vary depending on a person's age, but they include Streptococcus pneumoniae, viruses, the atypical bacteria, and Haemophilus influenzae. Overall, Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common cause of community-acquired pneumonia worldwide. Gram-negative bacteria cause CAP in certain at-risk populations. CAP is the fourth most common cause of death in the United Kingdom and the sixth in the United States. The term \\"walking pneumonia\\" has been used to describe a type of community-acquired pneumonia of less severity (because the sufferer can continue to \\"walk\\" rather than requiring hospitalization). Walking pneumonia is usually caused by the atypical bacterium, Mycoplasma pneumoniae. =Hospital-acquired= Hospital-acquired pneumonia, also called nosocomial pneumonia, is pneumonia acquired during or after hospitalization for another illness or procedure with onset at least 72 hrs after admission. The causes, microbiology, treatment and prognosis are different from those of community-acquired pneumonia. Up to 5% of patients admitted to a hospital for other causes subsequently develop pneumonia. Hospitalized patients may have many risk factors for pneumonia, including mechanical ventilation, prolonged malnutrition, underlying heart and lung diseases, decreased amounts of stomach acid, and immune disturbances. Additionally, the microorganisms a person is exposed to in a hospital are often different from those at home. Hospital-acquired microorganisms may include resistant bacteria such as MRSA, Pseudomonas, Enterobacter, and Serratia. Because individuals with hospital-acquired pneumonia usually have underlying illnesses and are exposed to more dangerous bacteria, it tends to be more deadly than community-acquired pneumonia. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a subset of hospital-acquired pneumonia. VAP is pneumonia which occurs after at least 48 hours of intubation and mechanical ventilation. By cause Pneumonia has historically been characterized as either typical or atypical depending on the presenting symptoms and thus the presumed underlying organism. Attempting to make this distinction based on symptoms however has not been found to be accurate and The American Thoracic Society does not recommend its use. =Bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia= :Bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) is caused by inflammation of the small airways of the lungs. It is also known as cryptogenic organizing pneumonitis (COP). ;Eosinophilic pneumonia :Eosinophilic pneumonia is invasion of the lung by eosinophils, a particular kind of white blood cell. Eosinophilic pneumonia often occurs in response to infection with a parasite or after exposure to certain types of environmental factors. =Chemical pneumonia= :Chemical pneumonia (usually called chemical pneumonitis) is caused by chemical toxicants such as pesticides, which may enter the body by inhalation or by skin contact. When the toxic substance is an oil, the pneumonia may be called lipoid pneumonia. =Aspiration pneumonia= :Aspiration pneumonia (or aspiration pneumonitis) is caused by aspirating foreign objects which are usually oral or gastric contents, either while eating, or after reflux or vomiting which results in bronchopneumonia. The resulting lung inflammation is not an infection but can contribute to one, since the material aspirated may contain anaerobic bacteria or other unusual causes of pneumonia. Aspiration is a leading cause of death among hospital and nursing home patients, since they often cannot adequately protect their airways and may have otherwise impaired defenses. =Dust pneumonia= :Dust pneumonia describes disorders caused by excessive exposure to dust storms, particularly during the Dust Bowl in the United States. With dust pneumonia, dust settles all the way into the alveoli of the lungs, stopping the cilia from moving and preventing the lungs from ever clearing themselves. =Necrotizing pneumonia= :Although overlapping with many other classifications, necrotizing pneumonia includes pneumonias that cause substantial necrosis of lung cells, and sometimes even lung abscess. Implicated bacteria are extremely commonly anaerobic bacteria, with or without additional facultatively anaerobic ones like Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes.Table 13-7 in: The bacteria Pneumococcus type III is sometimes implicated. =Opportunistic pneumonia= :This group includes those that frequently strike immunocompromised people, such as people with AIDS and people receiving strong chemotherapy for cancer. Main pathogens are cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jiroveci, Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare, invasive aspergillosis, invasive candidiasis, as well as the same infectious agents that strike healthy people. =Double pneumonia (bilateral pneumonia)= :This is a historical term for acute lung injury (ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, the term was and, especially by lay people, still is used to denote pneumonia affecting both lungs. Accordingly, the term 'double pneumonia' is more likely to be used to describe bilateral pneumonia than it is ALI or ARDS. =Severe acute respiratory syndrome= :Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a highly contagious and deadly type of pneumonia which first occurred in Nov-2002 after initial outbreaks in China caused by SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-1,which almost disappeared by the month of May-2004. The second outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 started in December 2019 from Wuhan, China and was declared pandemic by WHO on 11th March 2020. SARS is caused by the SARS coronavirus, a previously unknown pathogen. By area of lung affected Initial descriptions of pneumonia focused on the anatomic or pathologic appearance of the lung, either by direct inspection at autopsy or by its appearance under a microscope. * A lobar pneumonia is an infection that only involves a single lobe, or section, of a lung. Lobar pneumonia is often due to Streptococcus pneumoniae (though Klebsiella pneumoniae is also possible.) * Multilobar pneumonia involves more than one lobe, and it often causes a more severe illness. * Bronchial pneumonia affects the lungs in patches around the tubes (bronchi or bronchioles). * Interstitial pneumonia involves the areas in between the alveoli, and it may be called \\"interstitial pneumonitis.\\" It is more likely to be caused by viruses or by atypical bacteria. The discovery of x-rays made it possible to determine the anatomic type of pneumonia without direct examination of the lungs at autopsy and led to the development of a radiological classification. Early investigators distinguished between typical lobar pneumonia and atypical (e.g. Chlamydophila) or viral pneumonia using the location, distribution, and appearance of the opacities they saw on chest x-rays. Certain x-ray findings can be used to help predict the course of illness, although it is not possible to clearly determine the microbiologic cause of a pneumonia with x-rays alone. With the advent of modern microbiology, classification based upon the causative microorganism became possible. Determining which microorganism is causing an individual's pneumonia is an important step in deciding treatment type and length. Sputum cultures, blood cultures, tests on respiratory secretions, and specific blood tests are used to determine the microbiologic classification. Because such laboratory testing typically takes several days, microbiologic classification is usually not possible at the time of initial diagnosis.

File:RLLpneumonia.PNGRight lower lobe pneumonia as seen on a lateral CXR Clinical Traditionally, clinicians have classified pneumonia by clinical characteristics, dividing them into \\"acute\\" (less than three weeks duration) and \\"chronic\\" pneumonias. This is useful because chronic pneumonias tend to be either non-infectious, or mycobacterial, fungal, or mixed bacterial infections caused by airway obstruction. Acute pneumonias are further divided into the classic bacterial bronchopneumonias (such as Streptococcus pneumoniae), the atypical pneumonias (such as the interstitial pneumonitis of Mycoplasma pneumoniae or Chlamydia pneumoniae), and the aspiration pneumonia syndromes. Chronic pneumonias, on the other hand, mainly include those of Nocardia, Actinomyces and Blastomyces dermatitidis, as well as the granulomatous pneumonias (Mycobacterium tuberculosis and atypical mycobacteria, Histoplasma capsulatum and Coccidioides immitis). The combined clinical classification, now the most commonly used classification scheme, attempts to identify a person's risk factors when he or she first comes to medical attention. The advantage of this classification scheme over previous systems is that it can help guide the selection of appropriate initial treatments even before the microbiologic cause of the pneumonia is known. There are two broad categories of pneumonia in this scheme: community-acquired pneumonia and hospital-acquired pneumonia. A recently introduced type of healthcare-associated pneumonia (in patients living outside the hospital who have recently been in close contact with the health care system) lies between these two categories.

The kettle \\"logic\\" of the dream-work is related to what Freud calls the embarrassment-dream of being naked, in which contradictory opposites are yoked together in the dream.Mills, Jon (2004) Rereading Freud: psychoanalysis through philosophy p.14 Freud said that in a dream, incompatible (contradictory) ideas are simultaneously admitted.Kabbalah and postmodernism: a dialogue By Sanford L.

Kettle logic, although a tool that may be simply noticed, is meant to present itself as truth. In other words, kettle logic is a way of combining contradictions to make a case. These contradictory arguments are put together next to each other; they are presented as if the contradictions themselves do not exist. This relates to one of Freud's views on dreams.Sigmund Freud The Interpretation of Dreams, translated by A. A. Brill, pp.366 An example of this is the aforementioned dream of being naked. This is one aspect of the \\"exorbitant\\" logic of dreaming, where the logic itself lies closely to illogical thought.

The site of the city was allegedly found in 1922 by the archaeologist Paolo Orsi near the modern village of Sant'Eufemia Vetere, but a systematic archaeological investigation was only started in 1997 and it is only based on coins found there. Coins, inscriptions and other artefacts retrieved from the site can be seen in the Museo Archeologico Lametino in Lamezia Terme. However, the actual collocation of the ancient city is in Nocera Terinese where the original location is situated on top of a hill called Piano di Tirena. This hill is surrounded by two rivers merging, Savuto and Grande, and it perfectly matches the description provided by the Greek historian Strabo in his major work Geographica, which was first published around 20 AD. History In the fifth century BC the Greek cities Croton and Locri, both located on the Ionian Sea, vied for the control of ports on the Tyrrhenian Sea. These ports were important for conducting trade. Locri had founded the cities Medma and Hipponium there and had assumed control of Metauros. Temesa lay north of Hipponium and had close relations with Croton, which may have been its mother city. Temesa was valuable because of its copper mines and its trade with the north. Locri conquered Temesa at some time in the first half of the fifth century BC, probably in the 480s or 470s. Croton was disadvantaged by the loss and founded Terina at this time to compensate. Terina's foundation is dated to 480–470 BC. It started minting its own coins sometime after 480 BC, which indicates that it soon became independent from its mother city. Terina became a prosperous city and protected the route from the Tyrrhenian Sea to Croton. Later in the second half of the fifth century BC Terina was attacked by Thurii, after that city's foundation in 444/3 BC. Thurii wanted to capture Terina because the city was closely connected with Croton, Thurii's enemy. The Spartan general Cleandridas who led the Thurian army planned a surprise attack, but this failed when his army was discovered. He retreated after ravaging the city's countryside. When the Bruttians arose as a new ethnic group in Lucania in 356/5 BC their first target was Terina, which they besieged and plundered. When Alexander of Epirus arrived in Southern Italy in approximately 333 BC he took the city from the Bruttians. He did not possess it for long because he was defeated by a combined army of Bruttians and Lucanians at the Battle of Pandosia in 331 BC. At some later point Terina became a Roman possession. It was ultimately destroyed in the Second Punic War by Hannibal because he could not defend the city during his stay in Bruttium. The city was rebuilt at some point because it is mentioned again by Pliny the Elder.

He is a holder of the Hero of the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union's highest award. Life and death Nikonov was born on 18 December 1920 into an ethnically Russian peasant family in the village of Vasilyevka in what is now Stavropolsky District of Samara Oblast. He joined the navy in 1939 and served as a torpedo electrician on the destroyer leader Minsk attached to the Soviet Baltic Fleet. Following the 1941 German invasion of the Soviet Union, Nikonov and many other Baltic Fleet sailors were deployed as emergency naval infantry. Nikonov fought in the defense of Tallinn (5–28 August 1941), the main base of the Baltic Fleet. While engaged in reconnaissance near the town of Keila on 19 August he was seriously wounded and captured. Despite being tortured, Nikonov refused to give his captors any military information, for which the Germans doused him with gasoline and burned him alive. On 19 April 1943 Baltic Fleet commander Vice–Admiral Vladimir Tributs ordered that Torpedo Electrician Yevgeny Nikonov forever be listed as a member of the Minsk's active crew. (This tradition continues today; although the Minsk was long ago scrapped, Yevgeny Nikonov is always listed on the active personnel roster of a Baltic Fleet training unit.) Nikonov was posthumously awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union on 3 September 1957. Controversy There is no documented proof of whether the story behind Nikonov's death was true. The whole story may be based on a propaganda leaflet drawn by Viktor Ivanov and Olga Burova, which depicted a sailor from a boat Minsk being burned by the Germans . In 1943, the leaflet reached a wounded commissar, Grigori Shevchenko, who claimed that the drawing depicted a sailor called Yevgeny Nikonov, whom he knew. Also, on the alleged day of the burning of Yevgeny Nikonov (August 19, 1941), the Germans were not yet in Keila, and the battle for Tallinn started only on the next day. It is also alleged that a former sailor using the name Yevgeny Nikonov has visited the burial site of Yevgeny Nikonov at Maarjamäe sometime in the 1980s, and also later the new burial site in Russia. The story of the heroic death of Nikonov was first published in the newsletter of the Red Baltic Fleet on March 26, 1943 . The information about the death of Nikonov appeared in the database of casualties only on April 24, 1943, that is after the story of the heroic death had already been published. Burials Nikonov was originally buried on a farm in Harku. On 19 March 1951 the Tallinn City Council decided to rename a street in Nikonov's honor. The same decree granted a request by Baltic Fleet Command for land in the Kadriorg district to construct a monument to Nikonov. Soon after, Nikonov's remains were ceremoniously reinterred in a picturesque location in Tallinn park, on the hill of Terra Mariana, and a monument was erected. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the monument was demolished. (The statue, now missing its head, is at the outdoor exhibition of Soviet monuments at Maarjamäe Palace of the Estonian History Museum.) On 2 March 1992 Nikonov was again reinterred, in his home town of Vasilyevka in Russia. According to some sources, when the attempt was made to disinter Nikonov's remains for reburial in Russia, his remains were missing – it remains unclear, whether the remains were there in the first place. There have been accusations that the remains were taken by Estonian nationalists, and were then offered in exchange for information about the burial location of some men of the 20th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Estonian) (a unit of Estonians who had fought for the Germans against the Soviets) who had been shot after the Soviets reoccupied Tallinn in 1944. So the reburial delegation from Tolyatti just filled the coffin with some earth from around Nikonov's grave and returned with that to Russia. Memorialization Monument to Yevgeny Nikonov, Nikonov Square, Tolyatti. (V. I. Zhokov and I. K. Timofeev, architects; L. S. Martynov, sculptor) Tolyatti, the city nearest Nikonov's birthplace, contains several memorials to him. A street was named in his honor on 13 November 1958, and a square in 1980. There is a memorial at school number 19 (now Lyceum № 19). He is depicted on one of the faces of the Obelisk of Glory in Liberty Square. A memorial was opened on 9 May 1979 in Nikonov Square in the Gateway District. A tanker (of the shipping company Volgotanker) was named for Nikonov. A street and a school (school number 68, where Nikonov had studied) in the Moskovsky District of Nizhny Novgorod were named for Nikonov in 1957. Later, a monument was erected in front of the school, and in 1972 the school opened a museum of the hero.

Origins The concept for \\"the Little Major\\" was born late in 1962 while Reese was en route to a tournament in the Canary Islands with Boris Schapiro. First with Schapiro and then with Jeremy Flint, Reese created the bidding system as \\"an Awful Warning of what might happen if every country playing international championships were to arrive with its own wholly artificial system\\". That project was soon overtaken by events and the system \\"was found in itself to be extremely interesting\\". SBN 7091 0003 5 Reese promulgated three general principles:Reese, Terence (August 1969), Seven-stone weakling, Bridge Magazine, page 96 & following #Aggressive openings on all hands that are ill-equipped for competition. All such defenceless hands are opened 1 or higher. #Early definition of range and type. Opening suit bids from 1 to 2 are precise as to range and pattern. #Extension of bidding vocabulary through use of relay bids and two-way bids. As the system evolved, it was awarded an 'A' licence by the English Bridge Union (EBU) which meant that it could be played in certain restricted events. It was first used in 1963 in international competition by Schapiro and Reese at the 23rd European Team Championships in Baden-Baden, Germany. That created a great deal of interest. Flint and Reese used the Little Major in the 1964/65 world team championship at Buenos Aires.See the remarks by (Jeremy Flint on the \\"Buenos Aires affair\\", citing his 1970 book Tiger Bridge. Features The meanings of opening bids are as follows: :1 = four or more hearts, might include a longer minor. Might be three hearts with a long minor (or both minors with 16+ high card points (HCP). A 1 response is a relay. :1 = four or more spades, might have a longer minor or a 17-19 notrump hand. Can be three spades with a long minor or both minors with 16+ HCP. A 1 response is a relay. :1 = NT hand of 20+ points, an Acol two-bid or stronger, or a weakish balanced or semi- balanced hand of approximately 3 to 6 HCP. :1 = 12-15 points, 5-4 or better in the minors. :1NT = 14-16 balanced. :2, 2 = 12-15 with a fair suit, unbalanced one suiter. :2, 2 = five or more of the suit bid and four or more of a minor. 16 to 20 HCP :2NT = Either a weak minor suit pre-empt or a strong distributional minor two-suiter. :3, 3 = Strong, mainly minor-suit hand, 15-18, usually 6-4 or 7-3. :3 up to 4 as in Acol. The Little Major was described in Bridge Magazine on two occasions, the last in the August 1969 issue. Abandonment The Little Major was abandoned entirely when its two- year EBU 'A' license was withdrawn \\"on the grounds that not enough players were playing the system\\". The entry for the Little Major in the 1971 edition of the Official Encyclopedia of Bridge had already noted that it was \\"now obsolete\\".

The junction is currently a 4 arm signalised junction with a flyover, allowing traffic travelling in an east–west axis to avoid having to use the roundabout. On average, 95,000 vehicles use the junction on a daily basis. A major further civil engineerig upgrade to make the interchange work on a freeflow basis is being undertaken with an estimated completion date of 2022, with Sisk as the contractorhttps://www.irishtimes.com/business/construction/builder-sisk- reports-profit-jump-of-73-to-24-7m-for-2017-1.3544316. History The Dunkettle Interchange was constructed in order to link the N25 to the newly constructed Glanmire bypass which formed part of the N8 at Dunkettle. The junction opened in 1992 along with the Glanmire bypass. At the time, the junction had 3 arms, along with two access sliproads to allow access to and from Glounthaune. The next significant upgrade came in 1999. In the order to facilitate the opening of the new Jack Lynch Tunnel, a 4th arm heading southbound was added. At the same time, the present flyover of the roundabout was added in anticipation of increased traffic levels. Access slip roads into and out of Little Island were also added along with access to the tunnel management building. A further upgrade was completed in 2006. This involved installing traffic lights on the roundabout in order to increase the capacity of the junction. Due to the volumes of traffic using the junction on a daily basis, the National Roads Authority and Cork County Council decided that the junction is unfit for purpose. Jacobs Engineering Ireland Limited was appointed by the NRA to create plans to make the junction freeflow in all movements. On 5 June 2011, the NRA presented five different solutions to create a free flow junction.http://www.examiner.ie/breakingnews/ireland/100m-plan-to-end-cork- traffic-nightmare-500164.html On May 16, 2013, a scheme was approved by the planning board.http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/100m-dunkettle- interchange-project-given-green-light-231374.html Future In September 2015, a new Capital Investment Plan was unveiled by the Government, which secured funding for the interchange.

It was initially owned by Huddart Parker Ltd, Melbourne. The ship was requisitioned for wartime service and used by the United States Army as a barracks and quarters ship through the war. Excursion service PS Weeroona Weeroona was one of several Port Phillip Bay excursion steamers operating out of Melbourne for day trips, excursions and picnicking to destinations such as Portarlington, Queenscliff and Sorrento. The excursion vessel was equipped as a luxury excursion ship capable of carrying 1,900 passengers. During the 1925 visit of the American fleet the ship was involved in an incident described as \\"A gratuitous insult to the Prime Minister\\" when the ship's firemen went on strike with the Commonwealth Ministers and a thousand guests, including foreign consuls and military officers, aboard in protest of comments made by the Prime Minister and demanding he depart the ship, although he was actually not aboard. The firemen demanded a bond of £100 that he was not aboard, a demand rejected, and the trip was cancelled. By 1932 the newer Weeroona was the only one of the line remaining in service due to increased land transport with Weeroona being purchased for war service 17 March 1942. An article of 1 November 1943 noting the steamer might not resume excursion service after the war mentions the company, Bay Steamers, was in liquidation and that the ship operated thirty- three years without a collision, that four of her captains had retired and died and that she had made 2,774 voyages, travelled and carried 3,030,508 passengers in that service. U.S. Army World War II service Weeroona (S-195), Small Ships Section, United States Army Services of Supply, Southwest Pacific Area, 1943. Weeroona became part of the United States Army permanent local fleet under the Southwest Pacific Area command's supply organisation, United States Army Services of Supply, Southwest Pacific Area (USASOS SWPA), and was used extensively serving as a quarters ship for American maritime personnel. As part of the Small Ships Section the vessel was given the local fleet number S-195 and perhaps also as CSQ-1.\\"CSQ-1\\" was probably unofficial as the official reference (Thompson & Harris) notes \\"A fifth vessel, which they had converted into barracks to accommodate operating personnel, they dubbed CSQ (communications ship quarters)\\" while S numbers were used administratively for Small Ships vessels. Weeroona was used as a quarters ship by Australian personnel under contract to the U.S. Army's Small Ships Section in Sydney and New Guinea. The ship was also used by U.S. Army Signal Corps personnel, some of whom were setting up small ships as communications ships, as barracks and dubbed CSQ for communications ship quarters. Weeroona was towed from New Guinea to the Philippines to support Allied forces there at Leyte Gulf and eventually serving as a barracks and convalescent ship in Manila until towed back to Sydney, where she lingered in the harbour until broken up in 1951.

Bogardus was, in fact, the second clergyman in all of the New Netherlands. (The slightly obscure early history of the Dutch colony meant that he was often considered the first clergyman.)See Charles Hemstreet, \\"CHAPTER IV: Walter Van Twiller, Second of the Dutch Governors From 1633 to 1637\\" Chap. in The Story of Manhattan, (New York City: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1901), Released as The Project Gutenberg eBook, The Story of Manhattan, by Charles Hemstreet, E-text prepared by Gregory Smith, David Garcia, and the Project Gutenberg Online Distributed Proofreading Team Early life in the Netherlands Everardus Bogardus was born in Woerden, in the province of Utrecht, Holland in 1607. He entered Leyden University for the study of theology in July, 1627.Hudson-Mohawk Genealogical and Family Memoirs, Cuyler Reynolds, ed. (New York: Lewis Historical Publishing Company, 1911), Vol. II, pp. 504-510 On January 11, 1632, just five years after he had entered Leyden University, he was ordained a regular minister of the Dutch Reformed church. Soon after he was commissioned by the \\"Lords Directors of the Honorable West India Company of the United Provinces of the Netherlands,\\" to minister to the spiritual needs of the colony at New Amsterdam. Life in New Netherland Bogardus arrived in New Netherland in 1633, sailing from Amsterdam on the ship \\"Zoutberg\\". When it became known that Kiliaen van Rensselaer planned to erect a church upriver at Rensselaerswyck, Governor Kieft hastened his plans to rebuild the church in Fort Amsterdam.Frijhoff, Willem. Fulfilling God's Mission: The Two Worlds of Dominie Everardus Bogardus, 1607-1647, BRILL, 2007, , p. 460 A humorous anecdote about the building of this church contends that Bogardus frequently was combative with the Directors of New Netherland and their management of the Dutch West India Company colony, going up against the often-drunk Wouter van Twiller and famously denouncing Willem Kieft from the pulpit during the colony's disastrously bloody Kieft's War (1643–1645). He stepped up his denouncements when Kieft tried to place a tax on beer. Death Bogardus died September 27, 1647 in the Princess Amelia shipwreck near Swansea, Wales, while en route to Amsterdam along with many of his congregants as well as his opponent Willem Kieft, himself. Popular sources describe Bogardus... \\"on his way to Holland on a mission relating to his church. The people of New Amsterdam mourned for their minister, but there was little sorrow felt for the Governor who had plunged the colony in war by his obstinate and cruel temper.\\" Legacy Prominent members of that family included James Bogardus, who pioneered in the construction of cast-iron buildings during the 1840s.The Street Book by Henry Moscow; Fordham University Press 1978. Bogardus Place is located in the Washington Heights section of New York City borough of Manhattan (ZIP code 10040). It was opened in 1912, and runs one block (641.7 feet) between Hillside Avenue and Ellwood Street, and is named for the family who previously owned much of the land that forms both Fort Tryon Park, and the Fort Tryon section.

Background  Ohl was born in the city of Milwaukee March 16, 1873, attended the public schools, and became a typographer and member of the International Typographical Union.

Mellon Memorial Fountain is a bronze fountain sculpture by Sidney Waugh as a memorial to Andrew W. Mellon. It is located at the eastern tip of the Federal Triangle within the intersection of Pennsylvania Avenue, Constitution Avenue, and 6th Street NW in Washington D.C., United States. The fountain is across Constitution Avenue from the West Building of the National Gallery of Art. The Department of the Interior maintains the fountain, which President Harry S. Truman dedicated on May 9, 1952. Description Andrew W. Mellon Memorial Fountain and bench, with West Building of the National Gallery of Art in background The round fountain is made up of three small-to-large nested bronze basins, which sit in a granite outer basin. The outer, and largest, bronze basin is decorated in zodiac signs which sit in their \\"correct astrological position for the sun's rays.\\" The small basin serves as the venue for a 20 foot tall water spouting jet. The water then proceeds to spill over the small basin and over the edge of the other basins, eventually over and into the granite basin. Surrounding the fountain is a seven foot wide granite walkway and a semi-circular granite bench. The inscription on the bench reads: :1855.ANDREW W. MELLON.1937 :FINANCIER.INDUSTRIALIST.STATESMAN :SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY 1921–1932 AMBASSADOR TO GREAT BRITAIN 1932–1933 :FOUNDER OF THE NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART 1937 :THIS FOUNTAIN IS A TRIBUTE FROM HIS FRIENDS Information > \\"It sits like an island, traffic whizzing by on the three major arteries.\\" – > Gary Tischler The fountain serves as a tribute to Andrew Mellon who served as Secretary of the Treasury from 1921–1932 and ambassador to Great Britain from 1932 to 1933. The fountain shares a Classical architecture style with and sits close by to the National Gallery of Art where Mellon donated his art collection, as well as funding to build the art museum. This memorial fountain cost $300,000, which was donated by Mellon's friends through the Andrew W. Mellon Memorial Committee. The fountain was dedicated on May 9, 1952 and sits on the former site of the Saint James Hotel. =Creation= Its creation was authorized by Congress on July 16, 1947 by the Joint Resolution 1701: The fountain's cascading design was inspired by a fountain in Genoa, Italy. Tuck and Eipel served as the structural engineers and Edward E. Ashley Associates were the mechanical engineers. While excavating for the fountain, a 7 ft. x 8 ft. tunnel was discovered. The tunnel had to be backfilled with concrete to make a proper bearing capacity for the fountain. Two concentric rings of 30-ton concrete piles had to be driven down 30–40 ft. into the ground to ensure that the ground was level. The largest bronze basin was the largest of its kind ever cast at the time and required \\"casting in four sections\\" which had to be fitted together \\"with great precision\\". The fountain was cast by the General Bronze Company and Modern Art Factory may have cast the zodiac signs. The pink granite used is from the Swenson Pink Granite Quarry in South Berwick, Maine. The Aries zodiac faces directly east with the Libra symbol facing west and the Virgo symbol arranged along Pennsylvania Avenue, leading to some believing that Masonic influences were essential in the architecture. On the vernal equinox the sun directly hits Aries, which then faces the rising sun a month later. =Condition= In 1993 the fountain was surveyed by the Smithsonian Institution's Save Outdoor Sculpture! program and was described as \\"well maintained\\". Artists =Paul Manship= =Sidney Waugh= Sidney Waugh, who designed the zodiacs, also designed the sculptures seen outside of the National Archives and Records Administration and the Federal Reserve Board buildings in Washington, D.C.

He was also an athletics coach, administrator, and university professor at Tufts. Ellis is the namesake of Tufts' home football field, the Ellis Oval. He is regarded by many as one of the greatest athletes in Tufts history. Early life and playing career Ellis was born in 1906 in Norwood, Massachusetts. His family moved to Gloucester and then to Medford, where Ellis attended Medford High School, graduating in 1925. Ellis entered Tufts University that fall, majoring in civil engineering. Ellis lettered in four sports – football, basketball, baseball, and track – at Tufts, from which he graduated in 1929. He was the first Tufts student to earn varsity letters in four sports. In the summers of 1928 and 1929, he played for Orleans in the Cape Cod Baseball League. Ellis is best remembered for his time playing football. He played quarterback for the Tufts football team from 1926 to 1928, scoring a school-record 181 points. That record stood until 2016, when Shayne \\"Chance\\" Brady finished his Tufts career with 210 points. Ellis led the 1927 squad to an undefeated season, with the Jumbos posting a perfect 8–0 record. Ellis' future wife, Dorothea Loughlin, attended Jackson College – the women's college associated with Tufts – from 1927 to 1931 and played on the Jackson baseball team. Later life For a period of time after graduating, Ellis coached at Dean Academy. His stint included a period of time during which the team assembled three consecutive undefeated seasons. Ellis eventually returned to Medford and served as the head football coach at Tufts from 1946 to 1953, compiling a record of 25–34–6. He was also the head basketball coach from 1946 to 1953, tallying a mark of 74–75. In 1954, Ellis became a full professor and the chairman of Tufts' Department of Physical Education. Death and honors Ellis died of a heart attack at the age of 61 on July 19, 1967, at his home in Burlington, Massachusetts. He was survived by Dorothea and their two daughters, Faith and Susan, both of whom graduated from Tufts (as did their husbands). Dorothea passed away on October 14, 2011. The football field at Tufts University was named in his honor as Frederick M. Ellis Oval at homecoming in 1969. The Frederick M. Ellis Prize Scholarship at Tufts is named in his memory.

History In December 1777, John Campbell of Barbreck received letters of service from King George III to raise a regiment of infantry in the county of Argyll for service in the regular army. Campbell had held a commission in the old 78th, or Fraser's Highlanders during the French and Indian War. Most regimental officers were commissioned in 1777, but the first muster of the regiment was not held until April 1778. It was inspected at Glasgow in May 1778 and sailed for Halifax, Nova Scotia, in August 1778. The regiment's flank companies (the grenadier and light infantry companies) joined the main British army in New York in the spring of 1779, while the remainder of the regiment moved to Bagaduce in Massachusetts (now the town of Castine, Maine) to establish the colony New Ireland. The regiment, together with a detachment of the 82nd Regiment of Foot, began construction of a post to be called Fort George, which they held through July and early August against attacks by an American expeditionary force from Massachusetts under Commodore Dudley Saltonstall and General Solomon Lovell. On 13 August, a relief force of British ships arrived from New York under the command of Commodore Sir George Collier, and the Americans gave up their siege and withdrew. The regiment remained at Fort George until January 1784, when the fort was evacuated and the troops returned to Halifax. There they were reunited with the regiment's flank companies; these had served with General Sir Henry Clinton in South Carolina in 1779 and 1780. The Light Company had also served in Virginia in 1781, ending as part of Lord Cornwallis' army that had surrendered at Yorktown in October 1781 and remaining as prisoners until the end of the war in 1783, when they had returned to New York. The regiment, now complete, returned to Great Britain in 1784, landing at Portsmouth and marching from there to Stirling, where it was disbanded on 24 May 1784. A set of bagpipes, believed to have been played at the mustering of the regiment in 1778 by one Piper MacCorquodale are in the collection of the National Museums of Scotland. After the war, many of the soldiers settled in St. Andrews, New Brunswick.

In the process of becoming an ace, he rose as far as the rank of captain. During World War II, he returned to service, reached the rank of Wing Commander, and won an OBE. Early life William Roy Irwin was born on 7 June 1898 in Ripley, Canada, to Marion Jane Reavie 1872-1918 and Robert Irwin 1869-1918. He was still living in Ripley when he enlisted on 16 June 1916. He traded the life of a student for the military. The physical description on his enlistment papers describes him as 5 feet 7 1/2 inches tall, with brown eyes, dark hair, and a \\"fresh\\" complexion. World War I William Roy Irwin joined the Canadian Expeditionary Force with the aim of serving in the Royal Naval Air Service. Upon his arrival in Britain, he was switched to the Royal Flying Corps. On 22 November 1917, probationary second lieutenant W. R. Irwin was appointed a Flying Officer. This date also marked his later postdated promotion to lieutenant. Once assigned to 56 Squadron at the combat front in France, Irwin flew his first patrol on 1 March 1918, as a Royal Aircraft Factory SE.5a pilot. He joined the war even as the Germans launched their last great offensive of the war. Two months later, on 3 May 1918, he joined Trevor Durrant and Edward Dawson Atkinson in destroying one German Rumpler two-seater reconnaissance plane and driving another down out of control. Then, on an evening patrol on 28 June, he destroyed an Albatros D.III fighter for his third win. Irwin would not score again until 8 August 1918, when he destroyed a Fokker D.VII northeast of Chaulnes. He would proceed to score five more victories over Fokker D.VIIs that month. He destroyed two of them on the morning of 10 August and drove down another out of control in the evening; two days later, he destroyed another pair. On 28 August, he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for his feats. That his award was for his air-to-air prowess is apparent in the citation accompanying the DFC: > This officer is a fine leader, displaying tactical skill and personal > gallantry. On the 10th August he led his flight down to attack fifteen > Fokkers. In the engagement that ensued he showed brilliant leadership and > personal courage, accounting for two machines himself. He has destroyed five > enemy aeroplanes and brought down three out of control.(Flight, 7 November > 1918) > http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1918/1918%20-%201248.html?search=William%20Roy%20Irwin > Retrieved 8 April 2011. Irwin destroyed another pair of Fokker D.VIIs on the morning of 3 September 1918, rounding out his total tally at nine enemy planes destroyed and two driven down out of control. However, on 15 September, he pounced on a decoy two-seater and was in turn jumped by four enemy fighters. He was wounded in action during the dogfight, but escaped. It was while he remained in hospital on 23 September that he was awarded a Bar in lieu of a second award of the DFC. Once again, the award citation stressed his aerial tactics and success: > This officer is an exceptionally skilful pilot leader, combining fine > fighting qualities with sound, clear judgement. On the 12 August [1918] he > led his patrol to attack a large formation of Fokker biplanes; he himself > accounted for two of them. On a later date, attacking a formation of Fokker > biplanes, he again destroyed two, the patrol accounting for two others. Shortly thereafter, Irwin was discharged from hospital and assigned to instructor duty at the Central Flying School in Upavon. The war ended while he was in this assignment. Between the World Wars On 28 September 1919, Irwin was transferred to unemployed list of the Royal Air Force. He returned to Canada for a university education. On 14 October 1921, he married Doris Isobel Dickin 1900-1992 at Weyburn, Saskatchewan, Canada. The union would produce two children: Roy Keith Irwin 1922-1942 and Doreen Marion Irwin 1924-2000. William & Doris later divorced. http://www.sandycline.com/family/html/fam02399.html Retrieved 12 April 2011. World War II and beyond Irwin was a high school teacher in Saskatchewan until the beginning of World War II. He then joined the Royal Canadian Air Force, underwent refresher training, and became an instructor at No. 3 Elementary Flying School at Yorkton, Canada. He was subsequently appointed to command of No. 3 Service Flying Training School. On 1 January 1944, Wing Commander Irwin was awarded Order of the British Empire for his efforts. He would serve through war's end, resigning from the RCAF in August 1945.

Following a string of tabloid allegations about his personal life, he was dismissed in October 2002 after presenting two shows of the 24th series. Regular team captain Paul Merton stood in as the host of the first episode following Deayton's departure, following which the programme was presented by a different guest host each week (many of which have presented several editions of the show). This was initially intended as a short-term solution while producers were looking for a full-time replacement; however, having a different guest host each week proved successful, with average audience figures increasing from 6 million to 7 million. It was therefore announced in June 2003 that this feature would continue. As of 16 October 2020, 116 people (not including Deayton himself) have presented, or co-presented, at least one episode of Have I Got News for You. List of guest presenters Alexander Armstrong has made the most appearances as guest presenter having hosted 34 episodes. Paul Merton, regular team captain, was the first guest host. Jeremy Clarkson was the first person to make their first appearance on the show as a guest host. Charlotte Church is the youngest person to present an episode, being 17 years old at the time. John Torode and Gregg Wallace were the first co-hosts of an episode. Sir Roger Moore was the oldest person to present an episode, being 85 at the time. The following is a list of the guest presenters in the order they first appeared. Many have previously appeared as guest panellists; apart from Merton, who continued his regular role as team captain after hosting the first post-Deayton episode, there are twelve other people who have appeared as a panellist after being a guest presenter: Clive Anderson, Gyles Brandreth, Marcus Brigstocke, Jimmy Carr, Jeremy Clarkson, Alan Johnson (both of whom subsequently appeared as a guest host again), Charles Kennedy, Richard Madeley, Richard Osman, Robert Peston, John Prescott and Liza Tarbuck.

Same-sex sexual activity is legal in Kentucky. Same-sex couples and families headed by same-sex couples are not eligible for all of the protections available to opposite-sex married couples. On February 12, 2014, a federal judge ruled that the state must recognize same-sex marriages from other jurisdictions, but the ruling was put on hold pending review by the Sixth Circuit. Same sex-marriage is now legal in the state under the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges. The decision, which struck down Kentucky's statutory and constitutional bans on same-sex marriages, and all other same sex marriage bans elsewhere in the country, was handed down on June 26, 2015. Like a number of Southern states in the U.S., Kentucky has generally been viewed as socially conservative; however, recent polls indicate that a slim majority (51 percent) of Kentuckians support same-sex marriage, and support has been increasing over time.https://www.prri.org/wp- content/uploads/2018/05/AVA-2017-FINAL.pdf In 2010, Lexington elected its first openly gay major, Jim Gray, who went on to become the first openly LGBT Senate candidate from Kentucky in 2016. Several cities in the state prohibit discrimination in employment, housing, and accommodations on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. The Louisville-based Fairness Campaign, founded in 1991, is the state's oldest and largest LGBT advocacy organization in operation. In 2008, a Fairness Coalition was formed to collectively advance LGBT anti-discrimination protections in the commonwealth; its members are the American Civil Liberties Union of Kentucky, Fairness Campaign, Kentucky Commission on Human Rights, and Lexington Fairness. Laws against homosexuality In 1992 the Kentucky Supreme Court ruled the section of Kentucky's sodomy statute criminalizing consensual sodomy violated the Kentucky state constitution. In overturning the consensual sodomy statute (KRS 510.100) in the Kentucky v. Wasson case, the Kentucky Supreme Court decriminalized consensual sodomy. The statute remains on the books but remains unenforceable. In Lawrence v. Texas, the 2003 U.S. Supreme Court ruling overturning the remaining state sodomy laws, the U.S. Supreme Court further affirmed that such statutes violate the U.S. Constitution. The former Kentucky statute criminalized consensual sexual relations between people of the same sex, even if conducted in private. Specifically, the law criminalized genital- oral (oral sex), genital-anal (anal sex), and anal-oral (rimming) sex – but only between partners of the same sex. Such sexual activities between mixed- sex (male-female) couples were legal. Such conduct was a misdemeanor punishable by up to 12 months in jail and a fine of up to $500. Solicitation of same was also a misdemeanor, punishable by up to 90 days in jail and a fine of up to $250. Historically, Kentucky's sodomy statutes had changed over time. The 1860 sodomy statute criminalized anal penetration by a penis and applied to both male-female couples and male-male couples. Because the law focused exclusively on penile-anal penetration, consensual sex between women was technically legal in Kentucky until 1974. In fact, in 1909 the Kentucky Supreme Court issued a ruling in Commonwealth v. Poindexter involving two African-American men arrested for consensual oral sex. In this decision the court upheld that the then current sodomy law did not criminalize oral sex but only anal sex. In 1974, Kentucky revised its statutes as part of a penal code reform advocated by the American Law Institute. While the American Law Institute urged states to decriminalize consensual sodomy and other victimless crimes, the Kentucky legislature chose to decriminalize anal sex involving male-female couples but to broaden the new statute to criminalize anal- genital, oral-genital, and oral-anal sexual contact involving same-sex couples (both male-male and female-female couples). Thus, the 1974 revised statute decriminalized consensual anal sex for mixed-sex couples but expanded criminalization of sexual acts to include both male and female same-sex couples. Kentucky also reduced consensual sodomy from a felony to a misdemeanor in 1974.William N. Eskridge, Dishonorable Passions: Sodomy Laws in America, 1861–2003 (NY: Penguin Group, 2008), 201n, available online, accessed April 10, 2010 It was this final remaining consensual sodomy statute, which criminalized only same-sex behavior, which was ruled unconstitutional by the Kentucky Supreme Court in Kentucky v. Wasson in 1992.Commonwealth v. Wasson, accessed April 13, 2011 Recognition of same-sex relationships domestic partner benefits either county-wide or in particular cities. On November 9, 1973, the Kentucky Court of Appeals ruled in Jones v. Hallahan that two women were properly denied a marriage license based on dictionary definitions of marriage, despite the fact that state statutes do not restrict marriage to a female-male couple. Its decision said that \\"in substance, the relationship proposed ... is not a marriage.\\" Kentucky Court of Appeals: Jones v. Callahan, November 9, 1973 Kentucky voters adopted a constitutional amendment in November 2004 that defined marriage as the union of a man and a woman and prohibited the recognition of same-sex relationships under any other name.CNN: 2004 Ballot Measures, accessed April 13, 2011 Similar restrictions have appeared in the state statutes since July 1998 as well. Kentucky has extended hospital visitation rights to same-sex couples through a designated visitor statute. =Federal lawsuits= Two lawsuits filed in federal court in (Bourke v. Beshear) 2013 and (Love v. Beshear) 2014 have challenged Kentucky's denial of marriage licenses to same-sex couples (Love case) as well as the state's refusal to recognize same-sex marriages established in other jurisdictions (Bourke case). The plaintiffs in the Bourke case won recognition of their marriages on February 12, 2014 and on February 14, 2014 the Love case was filed in order for couples to be allowed to marry in Kentucky. The Love was ruled on in July 2014 in the U.S. District Court in Louisville Kentucky. On appeal, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals heard oral arguments on August 6, 2014. The Sixth Circuit overturned the rules in favor of the same-sex couples from Kentucky, Ohio, Tennessee and Michigan. The cases were appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court under the Obergefell case name. On June 26, 2015, the Supreme Court ruled that all states in the U.S. were required to recognize the marriages of, and provide marriage licenses to same-sex couples.See Obergefell V. Hodges, 576 U.S. ____ (2015), https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/576/14-556/ Adoption and parenting Kentucky permits adoption by individuals or married couples only. In February 2009 Senate Bill 68 (SB 68) was introduced to the Kentucky Senate by Senator Gary Tapp (R-Waddy). If passed, SB 68 would have barred any unmarried cohabiting couples from fostering or adopting children in Kentucky. Many Kentucky fairness supporters, along with foster and adoption agencies, rallied against the bill. The Senate Judiciary Committee passed SB 68 in a hastily called, unadvertised meeting upon Senate adjournment March 5, 2009, but it died when the legislative session ended without the full Senate putting SB 68 to a vote. This was the first time a piece of anti-LGBT legislation had passed a Kentucky Senate Committee without also passing the full chamber. On January 5, 2010 House Bill 195 (HB 195) was introduced to the Kentucky House by Representative Tom Burch (D-Louisville). If passed, HB 195 would have redefined stepparent to include any non-relative adult person who the court finds as sharing parental responsibility for the child. The House Health and Welfare Committee held an informational hearing on HB 195 on March 11, 2010—the first-ever hearing of a pro-LGBT piece of legislation in the Kentucky General Assembly. HB 195 did not receive a vote but further informational hearings were requested. Discrimination protections =Public employment= Public employment discrimination against state workers based on sexual orientation or gender identity is illegal under an executive order by Governor Steve Beshear (Democrat) in June 2008. Such discrimination was originally banned by an executive order by Governor Paul Patton (Democrat) under an executive order issued by him in 2003. When Republican Governor Ernie Fletcher took office, however, he removed these protections in 2006. Thus, Beshear's order reinstates such protections. In February 2013, Berea Mayor Steve Connelly banned discrimination on the basis of actual or perceived sexual orientation via executive order. The order applies only to the town's 130 public employees. =Private employment= Nineteen Kentucky cities have local non-discrimination ordinances—or Fairness Ordinances—covering sexual orientation and gender identity: Lexington-Fayette County (1999), Louisville Metro (1999), Covington (2003), Frankfort (2013), Morehead (2013), Vicco (2013), Danville (2014), Midway (2015), Paducah (2018), Maysville (2018), Bellevue (2019), Dayton (2019), Georgetown (2019), Henderson (2019), Highland Heights (2019), Versailles (2019), Cold Spring (2020), Fort Thomas (2020), and Newport (2020). Henderson originally adopted a non-discrimination ordinance in 1999, but a subsequent group of city commissioners removed the protections in 2001. A similar ordinance was passed into law there in 2019. https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/2019/06/25/lgbt-rights- henderson-kentucky-adopts-fairness-ordinance/1566687001/ Some of Kentucky's largest employers also ban sexual orientation discrimination through company policies and include such employers as Lexmark, the University of Kentucky, the University of Louisville, Toyota, Ford Motor Company, General Electric, PNC Financial Services, Yum! Brands and United Parcel Service. In January 2013 Vicco, Kentucky, a town with a population of 334 as of the 2010 census with a gay mayor, Johnny Cummings, passed a town ordinance prohibiting \\"discrimination in employment, housing, and public accommodations based upon a person's actual or perceived sexual orientation and gender identity\\". Vicco joined Covington, which enacted a similar ordinance in 2003, and Lexington and Louisville, which did so in 1999. Vicco, KY was said to be the smallest town in the United States to pass such an ordinance. =Religious Freedom Act of 2013= In March 2013, both houses of the Kentucky legislature passed the Religious Freedom Act which requires the state to show \\"clear and convincing evidence\\" for any statutes or policies that infringe on an individual's \\"sincerely held religious beliefs\\". The bill was supported by the Kentucky Family Foundation and the Kentucky Catholic Conference. More than 50 civil rights, public health, religious and other community groups urged Governor Steve Beshear to veto the legislation, including the Kentucky League of Cities, the Kentucky Association of Counties, the Kentucky ACLU and the mayors of Louisville and Covington. Opponents argued its wording was vague and could be used to override local non-discrimination ordinances. Supporters, including the bill's sponsor, Representative Bob Damron, argued it was needed to protect religious believers from state encroachment, citing the case of several Kentucky Amish who were arrested for refusing to put reflectors on their buggies when traveling government-maintained roads. Beshear vetoed the bill and the legislature overrode his veto by votes of 79-15 in the House and 32-6 in the Senate. =Senate Bill 17= In March, 2017 Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin signed into effect Senate Bill 17 (abbreviated as SB 17). This premise of this piece of legislation is to allow greater freedom of religion in public schools. Some of the main points of this law include allowing student religious organizations to use school facilities during non instructional hours, allowing students to display religious messages on clothing and allowing instructors to teach about religious holidays with the use of the Bible or other religious scriptures. Controversy about this law stems from its implication that student religious organizations in public schools can discriminate against other students, for example, on the basis of their religious identity or sexual orientation. This conclusion is primarily drawn from the clause, \\"no recognized religious or political student organization is discriminated against in the ordering of its internal affairs.\\" Many advocates for LGBTQ-rights claim that this law is anti-LGBTQ, and that religious freedom is just a guise to limit the rights of LGBTQ students. Furthermore, there is also concern surrounding the fact that this law pertains to public schools, which receive federal funding and are therefore under many of its rules and limitations when comes to public education. =EEOC v. R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes= On March 7, 2018, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit (covering Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio and Tennessee) ruled that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employment discrimination against transgender people under the category of sex. It also ruled that employers may not use the Religious Freedom Restoration Act to justify discrimination against LGBT people. Aimee Stephens, a transgender woman, began working for a funeral home and presented as male. In 2013, she told her boss that she was transgender and planned to transition. She was promptly fired by her boss who said that \\"gender transition violat[es] God’s commands because a person’s sex is an immutable God-given fit.\\" With this decision, discrimination in the workplace based on gender identity is now banned in Kentucky. =2020 Photographer marriage court ruling= In August 2020, a district court judge appointed by Trump allowed a photographer within Kentucky to refuse taking pictures of a same-sex marriage - due to an individual's held religious affiliation and beliefs. In his ruling, the judge wrote that “Christian” photographer Chelsey Walker cannot be compelled to take photos of same-sex weddings, even though she offers her photography as a public business, because her photos are “art” and art is a form of “speech.” Therefore, no government can force people to make any speech against their will. The judge said that requiring her to take photos of gay weddings would also go against Walker’s religious beliefs. Hate crime law Kentucky statutes cover hate crimes based on sexual orientation but not gender identity.Human Resources Campaign: Kentucky Hate Crimes Law , accessed April 13, 2011 On March 15, 2012, the Kentucky State Police assisted the FBI in arresting David Jenkins, Anthony Jenkins, Mable Jenkins, and Alexis Jenkins of Partridge for the beating of Kevin Pennington during a late-night attack in April 2011 at Kingdom Come State Park, near Cumberland. The push came from the gay rights group Kentucky Equality Federation, whose president, Jordan Palmer, began lobbying the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Kentucky in August 2011 to prosecute after stating he had no confidence in the Harlan County Commonwealth's Attorney to act. \\"I think the case's notoriety may have derived in large part from the Kentucky Equality Federation efforts,\\" said Harvey, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Kentucky. Mable Jenkins, and Alexis Jenkins plead guilty. Gender reassignment Kentucky permits post-operative transgender people to amend their sex on their birth certificates.Human Resources Campaign: Kentucky Hate Crimes Law , accessed April 13, 2011. A letter from the doctor stating that gender affirming surgery has been performed can be sent directly to the Department of Vital Statistics in Frankfort, prior to this, a Court Order was required for the gender change for a Kentucky born person. Conversion therapy In March 2020, Covington became the first Kentucky city to ban conversion therapy on minors by a vote of 5-0. In September 2020, Louisville became the second Kentucky city to ban conversion therapy on minors by a vote of 24-1.

The population of Stockholm has historically lived in constant fear of the outbreak of fire, because the risk of fires in the 16th- and 17th-century Swedish cities was great. Each citizen remained on night watch well into the 19th century. The worst fire in the history of Stockholm was the fire of Clara in 1751, which evolved into a firestorm spreading from Riddarfjärden to Södermalm. Only through fire retardant buildings, organized fire services, better fire fighting equipment, and running water from fire hydrants (after 1861), could fires be reduced and maintained. However, aside from the misery and damage that large fires caused in Stockholm, there were also benefits, such as the planning of new districts, neighborhoods, and streets. Fire protection, fire alarms and fire fighting Even during the medieval period, the city laws had regulations to prevent the occurrence of fires. In 1661, Stockholm produced its first fire regime. Householders were required to shout in order to alert people to the outbreak of fire. The city was divided into districts headed by fire chiefs, and building owners were required to have some fire equipment, such as filling the house with water barrels during the summer.Friman Others (2008), page 84 Stockholm Fire called out, 1880s When a fire broke out, church bells would ring and the care tower (watch tower) on Brunk Hill would hoist different signals. In one case in Skeppsholmen, there was a fire on salute batteries, and a certain number of cannon shots alerted the people in the town that it was burning. A decree of December 18, 1728, established a series of measures to provide a warning in the event of a fire. The sighting of unusual smoke was to be immediately reported to the master or mistress (under penalty of a fine), who would then pass it on to the churches to see if they agreed with the tower watch. This system would alert the watchmen in the towers in every neighborhood in which there was a fire at night. Later, they used particular church bells, flags, and cannon shots to warn of a fire. A fire on Södermalm required two signals. In Norrmalm, on Kungsholmen, and on the peninsula of Blasieholmen, three signals were used. The Old Town had four, and on the island of Djurgården, five rings were sounded.Landell (1992), page 50 In 1731, a solid brandvaktskår was established, the precursor to the Stockholm fire brigade. The Fire Union was funded by the city treasury and also patrolled at night, but the \\"care\\" or night watch that every citizen was required to keep extended well into the 19th century. In 1746, the Swedish insurance company Brandcontoiret was established in Stockholm. It supported the city's fire safety through grants to include water and better insurance policies for stone buildings. In 1828, the city's public Stood Fire Company was founded. The seat of the company's board was in the Ship's Bridge 20. In 1875, a new fire regime appeared in Stockholm, which for the first time possessed a professional fire department. Stockholm would have seven fire stations and two main stations, one in Norrmalm and one in Södermalm. Previously, there had been eldsläckningsmanskap, but it was male volunteers who put out the fires. Fires before the 1600s Fire-fighting in Stockholm in the 1500s Throughout its history, Stockholm has been struck by many large fires, one of the oldest documented fires ravaging the city on April 14, 1297. The years 1330, 1344, 1407, 1411, 1419, 1445, 1458, and 1495 saw the city ravaged by major fires. The fire of 1407 was caused by a lightning strike and was alleged by some sources to have claimed up to 1,600 casualties. This fire destroyed many areas, including the Black Friars' Monastery of Stockholm. After the year 1501, the building of wooden houses was banned inside the city walls. In 1552, the ban against fire hazards within the city was tightened so that the wooden houses in the town center were to be demolished and replaced with stone. However, there were still flammable wooden buildings, such as outhouses and sheds, left in the yard. In 1555, there was a fire on Stadsholmen's west side outside the new city wall, and all the houses from the Great Gråmunkegränd to Kornhamnstorg burned to the ground. They caught fire in pitch at the newly built fort along the shore. In order to fight the fire, individuals had to run to the east side of Stadsholmen to collect water to extinguish the fire. Fires in the 1600s Palace fire in 1697 Among the first fires that broke out on a large scale prior to the city plan changes was the Great Fire in 1625 that devastated the southwestern parts of Stadsholmen. The fire began in the evening of September 1, 1625, in a house along the bottom at Kåkbrinken and extended all the way up to the West Long Street stone house, and for some time the German church was under threat. The fire lasted three days and destroyed a fifth of the infrastructure of Stockholm at the time.Friman Others (2008), page 19 The fire resulted in the building of a new city over the burnt areas. Here was built the city's first main street, called Great King Street (now Stora Nygatan). The transformation is considered to be Stockholm's first settlement. Another consequence of the fire disaster was a tightening of the fire prevention measures, in which the fire chief and master of rotation would inspect chimneys and brädtak, and ensure that the houses had the mandatory fire fighting equipment.Forsberg (2001), p. 37-38 After a fire in 1642 that devastated the eastern part of Brunkebergsåsen and destroyed 247 houses, the city planned part of Government Street to become the main street. It was the beginning of street regulation during Clas Larsson Fleming in the neighborhood that is now called Östermalm. To help prevent the spread of fire, stringent rules were created to put pressure on landowners to build stone houses, rather than the more flammable wooden ones.Lundevall (2006), page 31 Another major fire during the 1600s was the Tre Kronor fire on May 7, 1697, during which the castle was completely destroyed, except for the newly constructed north wing. Most of Sweden's former national archives and the royal library were destroyed. Afterwards, the palace architect Nicodemus Tessin the Younger designed a brand new Royal Palace. Fires in the 1700s Fire of Clara in 1751 Despite all precautions and new regulations, large fires continued to break out in Stockholm. Approximately 200 houses burned down in Norrmalm in 1719, while the Catherine fire in 1723 destroyed 500 houses, as well as other buildings and Catherine's Church on Södermalm.Lundevall (2006), page 51 On the night of May 1, 1723, a fire began in a mill in the Maria Church and spread eastward, resulting in the collapse of the Catherine Church dome and the tower. The fire of the Catherine Church in 1723 was not the only church which caught fire in that year. During a night between May 14 and 15, a violent storm raged over Stockholm. Lightning struck St. Jacob's Church (today the King's Garden) and Clara Church. Jacob's Church tower was burned and destroyed, while Clara Church received minor damage. The worst fire that Stockholm survived occurred in 1751. It broke out in Norrmalm, developed into a firestorm, and spread from Riddarfjärden (an arm of the lake Mälaren) to Södermalm. Klara Church was badly damaged and 221 houses were completely destroyed. Brandcontoiret in Stockholm intended to pay about 784,000 dollars in insurance money, but it lacked the funds to cover the full amount. Only some of the affected homeowners had insured their houses, so the total cost of the fire was significantly higher than that sum. One person who was hit hard by the fire was geologist and mineralogist Daniel Tilas, whose house was completely destroyed. The fire demolished not only his home, but also the materials that he had gathered during 20 years of work and that would have been a Swedish and a global mineral history collection. His life's work had gone up in smoke. There was panic in the population that the fire was deliberately set, namely by one suspected arsonist. In 1759, the city was hit again by a disastrous fire to the same extent as the Clara Church fire eight years earlier. In Sweden, this fire is named Mariabranden (Swedish brand= fire). The Mary fire in 1759 in the Maria parish in Södermalm destroyed 300 houses and the Maria Magdalena church. About 2,000 people were left homeless. The fire broke out on Thursday, July 19, 1759, in a bakery at a fishmonger in the appellate Hill (currently Brännkyrkagatan) at Mary Hill. At the time, there was a severe drought no water with which to fight the fire. Fire officers were advised to act logically, and it was decided not to extinguish the house that burned down, but rather to \\"counter-fire with a vengeance\\" further away. Outside Sweden, this fire is most famous due to an occult anecdote that claims that the Swedish scientist and mystician Emanuel Swedenborg, through a sort of clairvoyance, \\"saw\\" the fire from Gothenburg. According to Swedenborg's biographer Lars Bergquist, however, this event took place on Sunday, July 29 — 10 days after the fire.Lars Bergquist: Swedenborgs Hemlighet, Stockholm 1999. . (In Swedish) Fires in the 1800s Riddarholm Fire 1802 Due to factors including more and more houses were built in stone, fire was no longer used for heating, lighting, and cooking, and a professional fire department had been created, large urban fires ceased in the late 19th century. However, fires in individual buildings such as palaces, factories, and churches were still common. The 19th century began with a fierce fire, the Riddarholm fire, which ravaged Riddarholmen on November 15, 1802. The fire started early in the morning in the Administrative Court's old house (Cruuska palace) and was caused by a guard master's negligent use of fuel. The fire quickly spread to the southern side of the house and lit the roof of the old King's House (Wrangel Palace), destroying many antiques, including the nearly 300-year-old woodcut Blood Carlsbad painting that was stored in the Administrative Services Archives of Wrangel palace. Another palace destroyed in a major fire was De la Gardie Palace at Norrström, south of King's Garden. In 1793, the theater was rebuilt. During a show on November 24, 1825, someone detected the smell of smoke on stage. Actor Lars Hjortsberg urged the audience to evacuate the hall. All spectators escaped unharmed, despite the theater only having one narrow exit. However, the fire still caused three casualties amongst the staff. The damage was extensive, but the remains of the buildings were salvaged.Nordisk familjebok, Uggleupplagan, Volume 6, page titles: Delagardieska palace, 1907, p. 64-65 (electronic source). Available: Lightning striking church towers and tall buildings, which then acted as lighting conductors, were a common cause of fires. On July 28, 1835, Riddarholmskyrkan was hit by lightning and, at the same time, lightning struck the bottom of the Katarina Church and Kungsholms church tower. The Riddarholmskyrkan towers could not be saved. The church roof and the vault collapsed the following day after having caught fire, although the church hall survived. The new tower at Riddarholmskyrkan was built in 1841, and was made of cast iron to better withstand fire. Factory buildings were also victims of flames. On January 22, 1842, fires burned down A. Bergman's cotton spinning mill at Stadsgården. The building and 1,000 fathoms of wood burned up. The fire was so strong that onlookers across the Salt Lake on Skeppsbron were showered with soot and sparks. The fire that had started in the factory's gas works caused more casualties, and led to 200 people losing their jobs when the factory abandoned the flammable gas and moved operations to Harg at Nyköping, where they could use water power instead. Late in the evening of November 11, 1873, a fire broke out in the Palinska house, resulting in the deaths of several people. The city realized that this could have been prevented with a time and purpose under fire. The fire led to the acceleration of the ongoing work with Fire Guard, and the formation of the Stockholm fire in the 1875-year fire regime. The nights of June 19 December 20, 1875, saw a fire sweep through the central printer. This fire killed four people, and Heinrich Neuhaus' unique panorama of Stockholm was destroyed. The panorama, which was in the process of printing, as well as the lithographic stones, were rendered useless.Grandien (1968), page 57 The most famous factory fire was Eldkvarn in eastern Kungsholmen, which burned on October 31, 1878. The event gave rise to the phrase \\"not since Eldkvarn burned\\" in the sense of \\"a very long time ago\\". Eldkvarn was a steam-powered mill, hence the name. The fire, believed to have been caused by flour dust falling onto a gaslamp which ignited, started just before 17:01 two floors up in the northeast corner of the house no. 1 at Hantverkargatan. The mill could continue to grind after the fire and was used up to 1906. On the Eldkvarn plot, with the block name of Eldkvarn, the Stockholm City Hall was later built. The same year that Eldkvarn burnt, a fire broke out in the German Church in the Old Town. Such a church fire in the middle of Old Town could have been disastrous, but the new fire department quickly responded and prevented the fire from spreading. The fire started early on the morning of October 7, 1878. This time, Stockholm's church bells were tolled, reminiscent of the old methods of warning of a fire. The church's 16th century spire collapsed with its bells on the church vault, but the interior survived. In 1886, the church received its current tower. Fires since 1900 Djurgården Theater fire in 1929 The Djurgården Theatre at Skansen on Djurgården Southern was twice ravaged by fire. Fire broke out at the old Djurgården Theatre on May 19, 1865, destroying the building just when the theatre was beginning its second season. It was rebuilt and re-inaugurated on 20 June 1867. On 21 June, 1929, the building went up in flames again and the wooden building disappeared in a few hours. The fire had begun in the kitchen area and spread quickly. Although the people who were in the building managed to save themselves, some firefighters had minor injuries. How the fire started could not be clarified.Grandien (1968), p. 78-85 Fire Meeting on Brunkebergstorg 1921 One of the worst fires the Stockholm Fire Brigade experienced since its formation in 1875 was a fire in 1937 in the central dairy at Torsgatan.Grandien (1968), page 102 The fire broke out on February 8, 1937, caused by a welder working in the attic above the fourth floor.Grandien (1968), page 92 He first attempted to extinguish the fire himself, but failed. The fire brigade was alerted and quickly arrived on the site. The men not only had to fight the fire, but also work under difficult conditions, including heavy ice (the temperature was 10 degrees below zero) and a wax layer of 3,500 kg, which began to melt and burn, and hindered the firefighters considerably. Two firefighters were cut off by the fire. One hung outside a window and fell, later dying of his injuries. The other was rescued at the last minute. Some acetylene cylinders exploded, injuring another firefighter. A stairwell threatened to collapse and officers had to withdraw the men. In the end, all of Stockholm's firefighters engaged in fire extinguishing, and all the firefighters were called to duty. In total, there were 70 people on the site, including managers, the fire chief, firefighters, and teachers from officers' school. Only after seven hours was the fire considered to be under control. The damage cost over a million dollars and Stockholm's milk supply was threatened. Milk Centre Fire of 1937 On September 5, 1970, IKEA's furniture warehouse at King's Curve burned. The cause of the fire was a short circuit in the large billboard. Codan paid an indemnity of 23 million; it was at that time the largest insurance loss in Sweden. During the night of May 17, 1990, Catherine's Church burned for the second time. The church tower collapsed and went through the church vault. All that was left was the church walls, but a few valuable textiles and church silver were saved. An investigation into the cause of the fire was inconclusive. The fire in the Stockholm City Hall in June 2008 Another notable fire hit Stockholm in 1990. On 28 September 1990, there was a large fire in the iron trade, John Wall's premises at the corner of Drottninggatan and Slöjdgatan. The fire destroyed the historic hardware store and a large part of the settlement in the district of Adam and Eve. At two o'clock on the night of June 5, 2008, a fire broke out on the third floor of Town Hall's west wing. It took up to 70 firefighters about three hours to control. The fire in the Town Hall was dramatic and, when emergency services arrived at the building, it was a fully developed fire, five- to 10-foot-high flames reached out of the windows. The fire department estimated that the entire third floor of the south wing was destroyed by fire. Since renovation work was being carried out, the building was empty and no people were hurt.

It is the story of a young man starting out in life, who must find himself a profession and a wife; and of a young woman who makes a marriage of convenience and must accept the consequences of her decision. Plot summary Harry Clavering is the only son of Reverend Henry Clavering, a well-to-do clergyman and the paternal uncle of the affluent baronet Sir Hugh Clavering. At the start of the novel, Harry is jilted by his fiancée, the sister of Sir Hugh's wife, who proceeds to marry Lord Ongar, a wealthy but debauched earl. Harry's father urges him to make the church his profession; but Harry aspires to become a civil engineer, of the type of Robert Stephenson, Joseph Locke, and Thomas Brassey. To this end, he becomes a pupil at the firm of Beilby and Burton. A year and a half later, Harry has become engaged to Florence Burton, the daughter of one of his employers. He presses her for an early marriage; but although she loves him deeply, she refuses, insisting that they wait until he has an income adequate to support himself and a family. At this point, Lord Ongar dies, and his widow returns to England. Sir Hugh, her nearest male relative, is a hard and selfish man, and refuses to see her upon her arrival. This lends spurious credence to rumours about her conduct; and it forces her sister, Lady Clavering, to ask Harry to assist her when she returns. Harry fails to tell Lady Ongar of his engagement; and, in a moment of weakness, he embraces and kisses her. This puts him in a position where he must behave dishonourably toward one of the two women in his life: either he must break his engagement, or he must acknowledge that he has gravely insulted Lady Ongar. Although he loves Florence Burton and knows that she is the better woman, he is unwilling to subject Lady Ongar to further misery. Lady Ongar, because of her considerable wealth, is pursued by others. She is courted by Count Pateroff, one of her late husband's friends, and by Archie Clavering, Sir Hugh's younger brother. Count Pateroff's scheming sister Sophie Gourdeloup, the only woman who will see Lady Ongar because of the rumours about her conduct, wants her to remain single so that Mme Gourdeloup can continue to exploit her. Mme Gourdeloup sees to it that Lady Ongar learns about Harry's engagement. Meanwhile, Florence Burton learns that Harry has been seeing Lady Ongar regularly, and decides that she must release him if he does not truly love her. Through the good influence of his mother, Harry comes to realise that Florence Burton is the better woman and the less deserving of dishonorable treatment. To her letter offering to end their engagement, he responds with a reaffirmation of his love for her. He also writes to Lady Ongar, expressing his regret for his past conduct toward her and making it clear that he intends to remain true to his fiancée. Soon afterwards, Sir Hugh and Archie Clavering are both drowned when their yacht goes down off Heligoland. This makes Harry's father the new baronet and the possessor of Clavering Park, with Harry the heir apparent. This increase in wealth allows him to marry immediately and to give up engineering, a profession for which he almost certainly lacked sufficient self-discipline. Lady Ongar gives up much of her property to the family of the new earl, and retires into seclusion with her widowed sister. Major themes The Claverings treats what David Skilton calls \\"Trollope's dominating concern of the eighteen-sixties\\": the choice of a career, in a broad sense. For a woman, the only possible career is marriage; for a man, it involves the choice of a profession as well as of a spouse. To Michael Sadleir, The Claverings was a precursor of Phineas Finn and Phineas Redux. Lady Ongar rejected Harry's honest love and married for worldly gain, and found misery despite her worldly wealth; in the Phineas novels, Lady Laura Standish chose the wealthy Robert Kennedy over the warm-hearted Finn, and found herself subjected to her husband's gloomy and domineering temperament. Both women were eventually freed by widowhood; but by then the men who had truly loved them were committed to others and beyond their reach. Evangelical clergymen in Trollope's novels were generally portrayed as \\"self-righteous, dictatorial, intolerant, and decidedly not gentlemen\\". Examples include Obadiah Slope of Barchester Towers, Samuel Prong of Rachel Ray, and Jeremiah Maguire of Miss Mackenzie. In The Claverings, however, Henry Clavering's curate Samuel Saul is depicted as \\"an Evangelical of courage, zeal, and selflessness\\". His diligence is contrasted to his rector's idleness; and Trollope rewards him with the hand of Fanny Clavering, Harry's sister, and with the living of the parish upon Henry Clavering's accession to the baronetcy. Development and publication history The Galaxy vol. 1 issue 2, May 15, 1866, featuring an excerpt of The Claverings Trollope wrote The Claverings between 21 August and 31 December 1864. The work was serialised in the Cornhill Magazine from February 1866 to May 1867; it was the fourth and last of Trollope's novels published in the magazine. It was issued in book form by Smith, Elder & Co. in 1867. In the course of setting the book in type, a section of two-thirds of a page of the Cornhill text was omitted, probably accidentally. In 1867, an American edition bearing the date 1866 was released by Harper. In that same year, Tauchnitz of Leipzig produced an English- language edition; a Dutch edition titled De Claverings was released by Brast of Dordrecht; and a Russian translation, Klaveringi, was issued in St. Petersburg. In 1875, A. Moe of Stavanger released a Norwegian translation, Familien Clavering More recently, editions have been released by Dover Publications in 1977, by Oxford University Press in 1986, and by the Trollope Society in 1994. Trollope received £2800 for the novel; in 1867, he also published The Last Chronicle of Barset, for which he received £3000. In 1860, George Murray Smith, Cornhill's publisher, had paid him £1000 for Framley Parsonage, his first serial in the magazine. Literary significance and reception Trollope thought that The Claverings was well written, with both humour and pathos, \\"though I am not aware that the public has ever corroborated that verdict\\". In his autobiography, written in 1875–76, he lamented that \\"I doubt now whether anyone reads The Claverings. Contemporary critics received the novel favourably, speaking approvingly of the moral lesson in the misery suffered by Lady Ongar after she married for money rather than love. A review in The Spectator declared that \\"Mr. Trollope draws with a sincerity that never fails him the true and natural punishment of her sin\\". The Saturday Review critic wrote that she had done \\"a wrong and a wicked thing\\", and that \\"she is punished just enough, and not more than enough, to vindicate the ways of society to women... Perhaps, if anything, she escapes too lightly.\\" Later critics also regarded the work highly. Sadleir described it as one of Trollope's five technically faultless books: \\"there is not a loose end, not a patch of drowsiness, not a moment of false proportion.\\" Still more recently, David Skilton wrote that \\"it has been usual to pronounce it among the most perfect and attractive productions of the novelist's pen\\", while pointing out that by the 1980s, critics were less insistent on the formal perfection shown by The Claverings, and more receptive to \\"the complexities of the Victorian multiplot novel\\". The novel sold well at the time of its initial publication, but has fallen from popularity since then. Skilton suggests that the volume of Trollope's production during 1866–67 may have overwhelmed critics and readers alike. Connections to other Trollope works Although The Claverings is considered one of Trollope's \\"singletons\\", it is apparently set within the diocese of Barchester: Henry Clavering, as a clergyman, is pressured to give up fox hunting by Bishop and Mrs Proudie of the Barsetshire novels. Archie Clavering is abetted in his courtship of Lady Ongar by his friend Captain Boodle; in The Vicar of Bullhampton (1870), there is a passing reference to \\"little Captain Boodle\\", and he briefly appears as a friend of Gerard Maule in Chapter LXIX of Phineas Redux.

The medieval structure was built for Queen Joan II of Navarre and later came into the possession of the House of La Tour d'Auvergne. In 1750 a new Chateau was built possibly incorporating part of the medieval structure and two towers dating from the seventeenth century. Built by a relative of the great marshal General of France Henri de la Tour d'Auvergne, Vicomte de Turenne the new building was created in the form of a cube surmounted by a large dome. It was intended that a large statue of Marshal Turenne be placed on top of the dome but this never eventuated. The Chateau was burned down in 1834 and the remains were demolished two years later.Knapton, Ernest. Empress Josephine, Chapter 21 Seclusion. Harvard University Press, Date accessed November 14, 2012. URL http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/People/Josephine/KNAEJO/21*.html The chateau was surrounded by the forest of Evreux, being part of the principality of Bearn. Joan and Antoine lived here during their rule. From there it passed on to other families and in 1810 became the home of Napoleon’s ex-wife Josephine. After Josephine the Comte Roy, minister of Finance, gained possession of the property. It became the residences of the Duke of Bouillon and then later the Duke of Leuchtenberg, his grandson, who authorized by an Act, sold the property in 1834 to the Marquis de Dauvet, for the sum of 1.2 million francs. The chateau caught fire in 1834, and the burnt-out shell was demolished in 1836. On the land a factory was built and the land and meadows were sold. As for the forest of Évreux, depending formerly the domain of Navarre, it was not part of the prerogative of the Empress Josephine. This forest was sold at around the same time as the castle, by the princes of Rohan, heirs of the last duke of Bouillon. It did not become the property of the City of Évreux until 1981.City of Evreux. ‘’Trangris’’.

It was fenced in on four sides by balustrades and had four granite stairways leading to four entrances. The chateau was topped with a dome that was covered in lead. Jeanne of Navarre In the 16th century, Queen Joan ruled with her husband Antoine of Navarre for many years, during this time they were called to the King of France and it proposed that Joan and Antoine give up their lands to the Kingdom of France in exchange for territory in France. The Kingdom of Navarre would have passed into French control and they royalty of Navarre would become princelings. Joan refused this offer and the Kingdom of Navarre stayed as it was until her death.Ryan, William P.F. ‘’Queen Jeanne of Navarre’’. London: Hutchin and Co, 1911.e-book. Henry IV was the son of Jeanne and Antoine and would gain the title King of France and Navarre when he became king. Josephine During the First Empire it was granted to Napoleon's ex-wife Joséphine, who was created Duchess of Navarre. In the period following his divorce of Josephine Napoleon showed many acts of kindness and gestures of respect to her - bestowing this property with its income was one of these. However it also enabled him to make sure she was not in Paris during the marriage celebrations to his second wife Marie-Louise and on any subsequent occasion when her presence might have been awkward. When Josephine arrived at the Chateau she was not pleased with the state that the Chateau had fallen into. She was not very impressed with the inconvenient layout of the house, which was arranged around a three storey high circular salon lit by windows beneath the dome. The great central salon was impossible to heat and many of the other rooms rather small. Uninhabited for some time the building was shabby and some of the wood panelling actually rotten. Arriving as she did in the depths of winter the garden was not shown to advantage as the bare trees exposed vast areas of water. The chateau had been built in the middle of a marshy area and despite attempts to form decorative canals, cascades and ponds the amount of water that surrounded the Chateau gave a very bleak outlook. combined with the shabby, cold and doubtless draughty chateau the overall effect was depressing. As a result, she wrote to Napoleon telling him that she was going to repair all of the ruins and embellish the estate with the bounty assigned to her.Ducrest G. “Letter XXXIX.”In Volume 3,Secret Memoirs of the Court of Empress Josephine. London:The Grolier society.244 While doing these repairs she spent a considerable amount of money returning the chateau to its previous state, and, admittedly in the spring when the garden flowers returned the property showed a certain amount of charm and elegance. Josephine had the water that pooled around the chateau (the former moat) turned from a stagnant body of water into a flowing waterway .Ducrest G. Chapter XVIII.In Vol. 1, Secret Memoirs of the Court of the Empress Josephine. London:The Grolier society. 188 The adjacent marshy area was filled in and used to expand the stables, Ducrest G.

Josephine established plantations, caused the marshes to be drained, erected public buildings and provided the peasants with work opportunities. She also improved the roads leading to and from the forest of Évreux. Comte Roy acquired the property after Josephine and he let the property fall back into disrepair.Ducrest G. “Letter XXXIX.”In Volume 3,Secret Memoirs of the Court of Empress Josephine. London:The Grolier society.247-248 Current state After the destruction of the chateau in the 1830s the grounds were largely be allowed to return to a natural state of woodland, the site of the chateau was apparently built upon as a factory and the gardens and meadows belonging to the property sold.

This forest was sold at around the same time as the castle, by the princes of Rohan, heirs of the last duke of Bouillon.

Pavilion Lake microbialite towers The Pavilion Lake Research Project (PLRP) is an international, multi-disciplinary, science and exploration effort to explain the origin of freshwater microbialites (similar to stromatolites) in Pavilion Lake, British Columbia, Canada.  History  After a successful initial field season at the lake in 2004, Dr. Darlene Lim (SETI/NASA Ames Research Center) established the Pavilion Lake Research Project (PLRP) in partnership with Dr. Bernard Laval (University of British Columbia). In 2005, PLRP acquired support from the Canadian Space Agency's (CSA) Canadian Analog Research Network (CARN) program, which has allowed the research program to flourish and evolve. The project also successfully acquired a National Geographic Research and Exploration Grant in 2005, and NASA continues to provide logistics, and education and public outreach (E/PO) support to the PLRP mission.  Analogue studies  In addition to exploring the microbiolites of the lake, the PLRP is also an analogue testbed, a place to test out operations and procedures to better understand how to explore using humans on other worlds, while maximizing the amount of science that can be done under difficult conditions. While the lake is not a close physical analog to the Moon or Mars or an asteroid, the complex operations of the field team and back room in dealing with communications, power, safety, etc., make the project an excellent operational analog. The project's field research demands the seamless integration of science and exploration field activities in an underwater environment inherently hostile to humans. The physical, mental and operational rigors associated with PLRP field science and exploration activities are comparable to lunar and martian extra-vehicular activities (EVA) where scientific exploration is a key driver. For the last several field season, the PLRP has used Deepworker submersibles to enable the scientists to map and explore the deepest parts of the lake, and cover much more area underwater than was previously possible with scuba divers. Deepworker is equipped with HD video cameras, so the scientists who make observations underwater can compare their observations with back room scientists after their dive, and a sampling arm, allowing microbialite retrieval from the deepest depths of the lake. While the operating environment is different, the Deepworkers share much in common with the Space Exploration Vehicles (SEV) that NASA is testing through the Desert Research and Technology Studies (Desert RATS) analog work. In fact, each year astronauts participate in the studies as scientist-pilots. In 2010, Chris Hadfield and Stan Love participated.

Description The painting depicts two women and a man in the lobby of a hotel. On the right is a woman with blond hair and a blue dress, sitting with her legs crossed and reading a book. To the left sits an older woman with a red dress, a coat and a hat. A man stands next to her, facing forward, with a suit on and an overcoat draped over his right arm. On the left wall, above the woman, is a framed landscape painting. A clerk behind the reception desk is barely visible in the shadows. Context Hotel Lobby is a signature piece in Hopper's work, displaying his classic themes of alienation and brevity. The Hoppers traveled frequently, staying in many motels and hotels throughout his career. This is one of two works in his catalog that depicts a hotel, the other being Hotel Window (1955). The older couple are believed to represent Hopper and his wife, at that date in their 60s. The hotel guests have been described as being \\"both traveling and suspended in time,\\" reflecting a stoic and dramatic feeling, reminiscent of the film noir movies Hopper might have seen and the complex structure and feeling of works by Edgar Degas. The painting uses harsh light and rigid lines to create a \\"carefully constructed\\" uncomfortable environment. The elevated and theatrical vantage point of the painting may be derived from Hopper's love of Broadway theatre which he often watched from the balcony. =Sketches= Before he created the Hotel Lobby Hopper drew ten studies of the work, which were later given to the Whitney Museum of American Art by the estate of his wife, Josephine. Nine of the ten studies are described as: *Study one was believed to have been executed while Hopper in a hotel lobby observed two seated figures separated by a lamp and table. That wall features a curtained opening, a registration desk and a painting on the wall with the stairwell and railing on the left. *Study two lacks the table and lamp and includes a second painting, which is separated from the other by a wall sconce, and one figure. *Study three depicts the stairwell being moved into the background. A figure believed to be male stands in the open doorway to the left of the stairs while a woman sits to the left of the doorway with an empty chair, a painting on the wall and a tiled floor. *Study four is more refined and has greater detail. The stairs are now removed with three people on the left: two seated figures next to a standing man. The rear doorway has a curtain, columns are on the reception desk, the ceiling appears to be beamed, a second painting is on the wall and a stripe is added to the floor. *Study five is double sided. One side appears to be an abandoned diagram of a room. The reverse side shows the room with a more detailed revolving door and a return to a single, framed painting on the wall. The reception desk columns are more detailed, and the stripe on the floor is darkened. *Study six is missing the seated figure from the left with only three remaining and in more detail. The figures and the elevator are in their final locations. *Study seven shows the fourth figure reappearing by the couple. The ceiling, desk, revolving door, curtained doorway and elevator all have greater detail. The couple also appears to be having a conversation. *Study eight was created to further detail the older woman's clothing and hands, showing her with a gold glove. *Study nine is a partial sketch of the younger woman who is reading, which shares the page with sketch eight, in greater detail. Until this sketch the other seated figure was a man. These studies show the older couple communicating, only to cease their conversation in the final painting and reading man is replaced with a blonde young woman reading in the final painting. The modeling for both women in the painting was done by his wife Josephine. After their marriage in 1920 she insisted on being the model for all of his female figures. The coat the older woman wears is based on a fur coat owned by Hopper's wife, a coat she often wore to openings and a rare find in the Hopper's frugal household. The red dress that the older woman wears (that Jo, in her journal, describes as \\"coral\\") signifies anger and extroversion, while the blue dress worn by the younger woman shows youth and distance. Throughout Hopper's sketches the clerk does not appear until the final painting. Under X-ray it can be seen that Hopper did little to change the canvas once he began work. Most alterations were made in the position of the young woman's head and in outlines of some areas in dark blue paint. A partial underdrawing was found but little detail remains. Hopper was known to model for himself for figures, as in Nighthawks, leading some to believe he may have modeled for the male figure in Hotel Lobby. One of the few paintings by Hopper to lack windows, Hotel Lobby uses light from the revolving door and an unseen area from between the ceiling beams. Reception In 1945 Hopper was awarded the Logan Medal of the Arts and a $500 honorarium for Hotel Lobby. The painting was chosen by a jury composed of Juliana Force, then director of the Whitney Museum, and artists Raphael Soyer and Reginald Marsh. In regards to the painting, Chicago critic C.J. Bulliet stated that \\"Mr. Hopper is getting a little lazy about the excellent formula he has hit. Hotel Lobby is typical Hopper, but Hopper that has lost something of its kick.\\" The artwork has been compared to Hopper's earlier work Summer Interior (1909), a work that helped to create Hopper's signature style; an intimate setting, simple lines and geometry, flat color usage and moody light. A shadowy figure and a sensual woman each make another visit in Hotel Lobby as seen in Summer Interior. Ownership and exhibition history The painting was in the collection of Henry Hope from Bloomington, Indiana. From June until December 2006 the Whitney Museum, which has the largest holding of Hopper's works in the world, displayed Hotel Lobby alongside their own works and key loans such as Nighthawks (1942) and New York Movie (1939). Hotel Lobby is currently on display in the Indianapolis Museum of Art's American Scene Gallery. In 2008 the IMA exhibited the work alongside the ten studies on loan from the Whitney in Edward Hopper: Paper to Paint, which ran until January 2009. =Publications= In 1996 Hotel Lobby was used as the paperback cover for the book Hotel Paradise by Martha Grimes.

From his earliest years he took a keen interest in science, especially chemistry. After attending schools in Norwich, Connecticut and Cincinnatus he decided to become an engineer. He refused an appointment to the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, and chose instead to attend Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute. The death of his father forced him to leave the Institute before earning his degree. The engineering training he did receive though enabled him to earn enough money to resume his education in 1873 with the junior class at Williams College. It was around this time that he took a side interest in medicine, devoting much his spare time to the subject when not engaged his normal class work. His connection with the Natural History Society of the college, however, caused him to decide upon biology as his life study; and upon his graduation in 1875 enrolled at the Peabody Academy of Science at Salem, Massachusetts, where he studied with Alpheus Spring Packard. Here his work was entirely in the line of systematic zoology, especially on crustaceans, that he published a number of papers on.\\"History of Tufts College, 1854-1896\\", published by the class of 1897, editor-in-chief Alaric Bertrand Start, 1896, pp. 138–140 Career In 1878 Kingsley moved to Providence, Rhode Island, to work as an assistant on the newly formed United States Entomological Commission. The following year he attended the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Science, where he studied general morphology. During this time he supported himself by drawing scientific illustrations and writing articles for various science journals. Kingsley then attended Princeton University, receiving his Doctorate of Science in 1885. In 1887 he was named Professor of Zoology at the University of Indiana and two years later accepted the chair of Biology at the University of Nebraska. He resigned in 1891 to take a year off to study in Europe, primarily at the University of Freiburg under Dr. Robert Wiedersheim. Upon his return in 1892, Kingsley was offered the chair of Biology at Tufts College where he would write nearly all the biological articles for Johnson's Universal Cyclopaedia. From 1913 to 1921 Kingsley served as professor of zoology at the University of Illinois.Elliott Coues: naturalist and frontier historian By Paul Russell Cutright, Michael J. BrodheadThe semi-centennial alumni record of the University of Illinois By University of Illinois (Urbana-Champaign campus) 1918 Over his career Kingsley would author over three-hundred scientific articles and numerous books on such subjects as vertebrae zoology, comparative zoology and the anatomy of vertebrates.

Biography Knaffl was born in Wartburg, Tennessee, in 1861, the son of Austrian-born physician, Rudolph Knaffl, and his wife, Rosalie. Rudolph Knaffl had been a court physician at the emperor's court in Vienna before moving to the United States in the aftermath of the Revolutions of 1848. After serving as a Union Army physician during the Civil War, Dr. Knaffl moved his family to Knoxville, where he practiced medicine. Knaffl's Madonna, 1899 Joseph Knaffl attended schools in Knoxville and Nashville. He learned photography working at the studio of his brother-in-law, early Knoxville portraitist T.M. Schleier. In 1884, he and his brother, Charles, formed their own studio, Knaffl and Brother. This studio, which eventually moved into a building on Gay Street, focused primarily on artistic photographs. Following Charles's death in 1904, Knaffl continued running the studio alone or with various partners. In 1909, Knaffl formed a portrait studio with one of his protégés, James Brakebill (though he continued to manage Knaffl and Brother as a separate studio). Knaffl was in charge of the photography exhibit at the Appalachian Exposition of 1910, and Knaffl and Brakebill provided much of the portrait work for the National Conservation Exposition of 1913.Gifford Pinchot, Don Carlos Ellis, Julia Clifford Lathrop, The First Exposition of Conservation and Its Builders (Knoxville, Tenn.: 1914), p. 279. He operated Knaffl and Brother until his death in 1938. Knaffl was married to Lula May Atkin, the daughter of Knoxville hotel and real estate magnate, Samuel T. Atkin. Knaffl's son, also named Samuel, joined Knaffl and Brother in 1924, and assumed control of the business after his father's death. Samuel Knaffl died in 1969, and the business, which had evolved into a framing gallery on Kingston Pike, passed to his widow, Sarah.Louise Durman, \\"Nostalgia Up for Sale: Knaffl Gallery Artifacts Reflect Knox History,\\" Knoxville News Sentinel, 20 January 1994. It finally closed in 1987. A grandson of Knaffl, Edward Hurst, Jr., was a noted portrait painter in the 1960s and 1970s. Works The Flower Seller, c. 1916 Knaffl's early portraits, which were influenced by classical art, were often based on religious iconography, such as \\"Knaffl Madonna\\" (1899) and \\"The Young St. John\\" (1903). After partnering with Brakebill in 1909, he began doing more character studies, such as \\"The Flower Seller.\\" During the mid-1890s, the Knaffls made a series of photographs that poked fun at negative racial stereotypes, such as \\"A Skin Game\\" (1896), which depicts three African- American card players cheating at poker.Finding Aid for \\"A Skin Game\\" Photograph , University of Tennessee Special Collections Library.

One such Knaffl photograph would later appear as an ironic joke on the cover of an album by jazz saxophonist Lou Donaldson.Jack Neely, Knoxville's Secret History (Scruffy Books, 1995), pp. 106-108. Knaffl's best- known photograph, \\"Knaffl's Madonna\\" (originally entitled \\"Madonna and Child\\"), was exhibited at the Photographers' Association of America convention at Celoron, New York, and was the subject of a Brush and Pencil article written that year by sculptor Lorado Taft. The photograph, which is a representation of Mary holding Jesus, is actually Emma Fanz (the daughter of Knaffl's friend, Knoxville sausage magnate Ignaz Fanz) holding Knaffl's daughter, Josephine. Since Josephine, apparently frightened by the noise of Gay Street, cried continuously, it took three separate shoots to get the image Knaffl wanted. Knaffl's photographs were featured in magazines such as The Photographic Review, Photo-era Magazine, Photographic Times, Anthony's Photographic Bulletin, and Wilson's Photographic Magazine.The Photographic Review, Vol. 22, Issue 7 (July 1916); Photo-era Magazine, Vol. 40 (May 1918); Anthony's Photographic Bulletin, Vol. 30 (May 1899); Wilson's Photographic Magazine, Vol. 33, No. 476 (August 1896).

The regiment mustered in for two years of service as the 16th New York Infantry on May 15, 1861, under the command of Colonel Thomas A. Davies. However, Regiments that formed later in the war and individual soldiers that reinforced the Regiment would serve three years. Companies were principally recruited as follows: A at Ogdensburg, B and F at Potsdam, C and E at Plattsburg, D at Gouverneur, G at DePeyster, H at Stockholm, I at Malone, and K at West Chazy and Mooers. The regiment was attached to the 2nd Brigade, 5th Division, Army of Northeastern Virginia from June 1861 to August 1861; Heintzelman's Brigade, Division of the Potomac to March 1862; Slocum's Brigade, Franklin's Division, I Corps to May 1862; 2nd Brigade, 1st Division, VI Corps to May 1863. The regiment was originally armed with model 1840 muskets. In July 1861 the state of New York replaced these with Pattern 1853 Enfield rifle muskets.

To Alexandria on July 11, from there to Manassas, where it was engaged but a very short time on the 21st and returned immediately after to Alexandria. On September 15, 1862, to Fort Lyon. The winter of 1861-62 was passed at Camp Franklin. Ordered to Catlett's Station April 6, 1862, but at once returned to camp; then ordered to Yorktown, where it arrived on May 3. In 1862 Major Joel J. Seaver of the regiment presented the members of the regiment with straw hats. The regiment was in action at West Point, and at Gaines Mill, its loss being over 200 killed and wounded. Their straw hats stood out on the battlefield, making them targets for Confederate guns. The regiment was present through the remainder of that week of battle, but was not closely engaged, then encamped at Harrison's Landing until August 16, 1862, when it returned for a brief period to Alexandria. In the Battle of Crampton's Gap it was in the van and lost heavily; was held in reserve at Antietam; at Fredericksburg was posted on picket duty, and after the battle went into winter quarters near Falmouth. It shared the hardships and discomforts of the Mud March under Burnside and was active in the Battle of Chancellorsville, with a loss at Salem Church of 20 killed, 87 wounded and 49 missing. A few days were next spent at Banks' Ford, then a short time in the old camp at Falmouth, and on May 22, 1863, the regiment was mustered out at Albany.

H. & Koucky F. L., Lake Beisan and the Prehistoric Settlement of the Northern Jordan Valley, Paléorient, Volume 12, Issue 12-2, pp. 27-36 The lake was previously part of Lake Lisan and reached its highest level in the Upper Paleolithic around 12,000 BC of 100 metres below sea level when it was included the area that is now Lake Tiberius (The Sea of Gallilee) and extended south as far as Wadi Yabis and Wadi Malih. It was first noticed by Dr. Leo Picard in a publication of 1929 who noticed higher altitude lake beds and eroded rock structures and named the lake after a notable ancient town in the area. David Neev conducted stratigraphic analysis in 1967 to provide further evidence from a sequence of sediments left by the lake. Archaeological evidence supports the geological with no epipaleolithic sites on the western side of the Beisan Basin below 100 metres below sea level. During the neolithic, the lake receded to approximately 200 metres below sea level due to erosion and formation of the Jordan river and an arid phase that peaked around 8500 BC. This was followed by a wetter and warmer phase between 7500 and 6500 BC where the population increased significantly and the receding lake gave way to agriculture. Later in the neolithic the climate became dryer and the lake further retreated to around 220 metres below sea level between 6500 and 5500 BC as the flow through the Jordan Valley reduced. After this, in the chalcolithic period it turned into a swamp with a possible shallow lake forming in winter. This left flood plains into the early Bronze Age when settlements intensified on the eastern side of the basin. The Jordan river gradually deepened sufficiently for all remnants of the lake to have disappeared by the time of the middle Bronze Age.

He disappeared after setting a postwar aviation record for prize money, and was the object of repeated searches throughout the years. War service James was living in Watford, Ontario when he enlisted in the Royal Flying Corps, and was commissioned as a temporary second lieutenant on 22 September 1917. After the completion of his training, he was posted to No. 45 Squadron in Italy on 12 February 1918 as a Sopwith Camel pilot. On 3 June 1918, he scored his first aerial triumph, destroying an enemy Albatros D.V over Feltre. Four days later, he destroyed two Albatros D.IIIs, one over San Marino and the other over Colicella. His next two victories over Albatros D.Vs that he destroyed east of Feltre on 20 July made him an ace. On 5 August 1918, he destroyed the only reconnaissance plane of his career, an AEG. The next day, he sent down two Albatros D.Vs over Segusino and destroyed a third. On the last day of August, he rounded out his victory string by destroying two Albatros D.Vs near Arsiero. On 23 September 1918, Lieutenant James was promoted to temporary captain, and in November 1918 was awarded Distinguished Flying Cross, with the following citation: :\\"An excellent scout pilot who has at all times shown great skill, courage and determination in attacking enemy machines. During a short period of time he has destroyed nine enemy aeroplanes.\\" On 6 May 1919, James surrendered his commission in the Royal Air Force upon being transferred to the unemployed list. He shipped out to the United States. Disappearance =Final flight= On 28 May 1919 James flew what was reputedly the first Sopwith Camel in the United States, from Atlantic City, New Jersey to Boston, Massachusetts. He was competing for a $1,000 prize offered by The Boston Globe for fastest flight between the two cities. At 115 miles per hour despite headwinds, he was much faster than a prior competitor's 90 mph gait. After landing at a field eight miles north of Boston, James departed again at 6 PM, supposedly for a stop at Mitchel Field on Long Island en route to Atlantic City, both of which are southwest of Boston. He buzzed frightened spectators watching his takeoff. It was Captain James' intent to follow railroad tracks from Boston on his return flight. He apparently guided on the wrong set of railroad tracks, as he later landed at Tyringham, Massachusetts, (near Lee), about 100 air miles west of Boston, to have his aircraft serviced. On 29 May, he was reportedly seen at 11:30 AM at an altitude of about 5,000 feet over Connecticut after departing Lee, Massachusetts; he apparently had a sound engine at that sighting and was headed southeast. A more reliable report tells a somewhat different story. On the morning of 2 June 1919, he took off from Tyringham toward the south, then turned west, away from Boston. He drew a crowd of spectators for his departure because the local populace was not used to aircraft. Because of his direction of flight, they thought he might be returning to the field he departed, but he did not reappear. =Search efforts= Various search efforts were attempted in the years that followed James' disappearance. On 5 August 1919, a berry picker in a ravine on Mount Riga outside Millerton, New York found aircraft wreckage which was speculated to be James'. Years later, on 17 December 1925 near Pittsfield, Massachusetts, several search parties went into woods trying to relocate plane wreckage discovered by a lost hunter from Brooklyn several days previously. James's uncle had posted a reward for the recovery of his nephew's remains shortly after the disappearance which was still being offered at the time. On 19 May 1927, U. S. Coast Guard Boat 290 found an aircraft wing floating in Fort Pond Bay, Long Island Sound. Captain James's brother, E. D. James, wrote a letter requesting a description of the wing, hoping to identify it. There was another report that his plane might have gone down in a river at Poughkeepsie, New York, but nothing was found. Despite extensive searches for him spurred partially by rewards offered, no sign of James has ever been found. The aircraft debris that had been found was never positively identified as being from James' plane.

In 1830 he was commissioned by the Knight of Kerry to design a new village on Valentia Island in County Kerry, which was later named Knightstown. His maritime engineering designs combined classical motifs with utilitarian functionality. Amongst other projects, he is credited with designing the village of Knightstown, County Kerry., the road from Galway to Clifden and the harbour of Roundstone in Connemara.Journal of the Clifden & Connemara Heritage Group, Vol. 2, No. 1, 1995 In the 1830s he redesigned over 30 harbours on the western Irish coast. At Limerick one of his major projects was the Wellesley Bridge which was constructed 1824 to 1835 (it is now known as the Sarsfield Bridge).

This article on military tanks deals with the history and development of tanks of the British Army from their first use in World War I, the interwar period, during World War II, the Cold War and modern era. Overview Matilda tanks at Tobruk. Tanks first appeared on the battlefield as a solution to trench warfare. They were large, heavy, slow moving vehicles capable of driving right over the top of enemy trenches; thereby eliminating the need to send soldiers \\"over the top\\" only to be blasted to pieces by enemies. The British Army was the first to use them, who built them in secret to begin with. To keep the enemy from finding out about this new solution, the public were informed that the vehicles were large water carriers, or tanks, and the name stuck. World War I established the validity of the tank concept. After the war, many nations needed to have tanks, but only a few had the industrial resources to design and build them. During and after World War I, Britain and France were the intellectual leaders in tank design, with other countries generally following and adopting their designs. This early lead would be gradually lost during the course of the 1930s to the Soviet Union who with Germany began to design and build their own tanks. While World War I saw the first use of the tank as a weapon of war, it was during World War II that the tank soon became a dominant force on the battlefield. The British, American, German and Soviet armies all had different approaches to tanks and tank warfare, each with their fair share of successes and failures. The infantry tank was a concept developed by the British and French in the years leading up to World War II. Infantry tanks were tanks designed to support the infantry in the attack. To achieve this they were generally heavily armoured compared to the cruiser tanks, to allow them to operate in close concert with infantry even under heavy gun fire. The extra armouring came at the expense of speed, which was not an issue when supporting relatively slow moving infantry. Once the infantry tank-supported attack had broken through heavily defended areas in the enemy lines, other tanks such as cruisers, or light tanks, were expected to exploit their higher speed and longer range to operate far behind the front in order to cut lines of supply and communications.  Background  No one individual was responsible for the development of the tank. Rather, a number of gradual technological developments brought the development of the tank as we know it closer until its eventual form was unveiled out of necessity by the British Army. The British Army designs were forced by the trench warfare in which neither side could achieve more than small incremental gains without heavy loss of soldiers lives, but tanks changed that. They were made to cross the trenches and quickly break into the enemy rear, while other tanks supported the main attack. The development between the infantry tank and the cruiser tanks had its origins in the World War I division between the first British heavy tanks which supported the infantry and the faster Whippet Medium Mark A and its successors the Medium Mark B and Medium Mark C. During the interbellum British tank experiments generally followed these basic classifications, which were made part of the overall doctrine with the work of Percy Hobart and Captain B. H. Liddell Hart. The next development of the more heavily armoured and upgunned tanks was brought about by the tank on tank battles in World War II German Blitzkrieg. This continued throughout the war, and led to heavy tanks which became the basis of the current Main Battle Tanks seen throughout the armies today. =British development= A German propaganda photograph showing a British tank destroying a tree The Landships Committee commissioned Lieutenant Walter Gordon Wilson of the Royal Naval Air Service and William Tritton of William Foster & Co. of Lincoln, to produce a small landship. Constructed in great secrecy, the machine was given the code- name tank by Swinton. Nicknamed Little Willie, this prototype tank weighed 14 tons and could carry a crew of three, at speeds of less than 2 mph over rough ground. Trench-crossing ability was deemed insufficient however, leading to the development of a rhomboidal design, which became known as HMLS Centipede and later Mother, the first of the British heavy tanks. After completion on 29 January 1916 very successful trials were made, and an order was placed by the War Office for 100 units to be used on the Western front in France, on 12 February 1916, and a second order for 50 additional units was placed in April 1916.Fletcher, David British Mark I Tank 1916 Osprey Publishing p.12 The great secrecy surrounding tank development, coupled with the skepticism of infantry commanders, often meant that infantry at first had little training to cooperate with tanks. Medium Mk A Whippet Medium Mark Cs A Carden-Loyd tankette towing a howitzer. Vickers 6-Ton Tank Vickers Medium Mark II Tank. The first use of the British tanks on the battlefield was the use of 49 Mark I tanks during the Battle of the Somme on 15 September 1916, with mixed, but still impressive results. Many broke down but nearly a third succeeded in breaking through. Finally, in a preview of later developments, the British developed the lighter Whippet. This tank was specifically designed to exploit breaches in the enemy front. The Whippet was faster than most other tanks, although it carried only machinegun armament. Postwar tank designs would reflect this trend towards greater tactical mobility. While the British took the lead in tank development, the French were not far behind and fielded their first tanks in 1917. The Germans, on the other hand, were slower to develop tanks, concentrating on anti-tank weapons. Following the Great War, many experiments involving armoured vehicles were conducted in the United Kingdom. Particularly many advances were made in the areas of suspensions, tracks, communications, and the organization of these vehicles on the battlefield. Britain continued its technical dominance of tank design from 1915 through to at least the early 1930s. British designs, particularly those from Vickers- Armstrong, formed the basis for many of the most common tanks of the 1930s and early WWII. The six-tonner, which was arguably the most influential design of the late 1920s, was not adopted by the British Army. The Carden Loyd tankettes (two-man vehicles with machine guns) influenced the tankette concept through export and similar designs such as the Soviet T-27, Italian CV-33, German Panzer I and other copies. Another notable design was the Vickers Medium Mk II, a pivotal design which combined some of the best traits of WWI tanks into a much faster tank. Eventually, by the 1930s, British experiments and policy and their strategic situation led to a tank development programme with three main types of tank: light, cruiser, and infantry. The Infantry tanks were intended to support dismounted infantry. The maximum speed requirement matched the walking pace of a rifleman, and the armour on these tanks was expected to be heavy enough to provide immunity to towed anti-tank guns. Armament had to be sufficient to suppress or destroy enemy machine gun positions and bunkers as well as enemy tanks. Cruiser tanks were to carry out the traditional cavalry roles of pursuit and exploitation, working relatively independently of the infantry. This led to cruiser tank designs requiring greater speed. To achieve this they were lightly armoured, and tended to carry anti-tank armament. In practice both cruiser and infantry tanks entered the Second World War with the same gun. The light tanks were tasked with reconnaissance and constabulary-type colonial roles, with cost the major design factor. An outstanding achievement of the British Army had been the creation of the Experimental Mechanised Force in the late 1920s. This was a small Brigade- sized unit developed to field-test the use of tanks and other vehicles. The unit pioneered the extensive use of radio to control widely separated small units. The unit was short-lived, however. However even though the British in the 1930s continued the design and development of tanks themselves, the Germans began to further develop tank strategy and incorporate them into their tactical employment more than the British. This doctrine of deployment led armies to equip their tanks with radios, to provide unmatched command and control, Germany along with the USSR also led the way with welding, although the US followed closely. Riveting and bolting remained in use in British designs. Infantry tanks were a continuation of the Great War tanks, heavily armoured and designed to accompany an advancing infantry unit (so were very slow). Once the infantry tanks had punched through an enemy line, lighter and faster cruiser tanks would be let loose to disrupt supply lines. The main problem with this strategy however, was that the British infantry tanks were just too slow and the cruisers of the time were vulnerable, and often mechanically unreliable. Come 1940, most of the British armour had been abandoned in France when the Expeditionary Force evacuated from Dunkirk, but this encouraged new designs. By the end of the war the increase in speed of the infantry tanks, and the increased armour of the cruisers, meant that there was little difference between the two classes of British tank. However, the British had to quickly build more reliable and more heavily armoured designs from the experienced gained in the early battles or acquire US designs to meet the needs. At the start of the war most British tanks were equipped with 2-pounder (40mm) guns which were able to penetrate contemporary German armour. The trend towards bigger guns and thicker armor which resulted in heavier tanks, made itself felt as the second World War progressed, and some tanks began to show weakness' in design. In 1939, most tanks had maximum armour of 30 mm or less, with guns no heavier than 37–47 mm. Medium tanks of 1939 weighed around 20 tons. Also if the tank's gun was to be used to engage both unarmoured and armoured targets, then it needed to be as large and powerful as possible, making one large gun with an all-round field of fire vital. Also, mounting the gun in a turret ensured that the tank could fire from behind some cover. Hull-mounted guns required that most of the vehicle be exposed to enemy fire. Multiple-turreted or multi-gun designs such as the British A9 Cruiser Mk I slowly became less common. British tanks armament and use in the battles also had to change as German Blitzkrieg tactics and doctrine shifted towards faster medium and heavy tanks fighting large multi-tank battles, with the role of the infantry tank in assaults taken by simpler self-propelled artillery. In British practice, the main armament of the infantry tank went in three phases. The pre-Dunkirk British Army Matilda I had only a single machine gun, a compromise forced by the low cost to which they had been built. The Matilda II gained a capable anti-tank capacity for its time, with the 40mm 2 pounder, but these were only issued with solid-shot (i.e. non-explosive) for anti-tank use and was of little use for artillery close-support of infantry. The follow-up gun to the 2pdr was already in development but the need to rapidly replace the losses in France delayed its production. Eventually 6-pounder (57mm) guns were put into the British tanks, and these could deal with pretty much anything but head on attacks on the German Tiger and Panther tanks - thanks to their special armour piercing rounds. As the war progressed many British tanks were equipped with 75mm guns from American Sherman tanks. These had better performance using high explosive or smoke ammunition, but could not match the 6-pounder against armour. Then the 17-pounder (76.2mm) was developed, becoming the best British gun of the war - able to deal with almost any armour put up against it. Operational use =World War I= A British Mark I tank in action on 26 September 1916 (moving left to right). Photo by Ernest Brooks. The British Mark I was the world's first combat tank, entering service in August 1916, and first used in action on the morning of 15 September 1916. It was developed to be able to cross trenches, resist small-arms fire, travel over difficult terrain, carry supplies, and be able to capture fortified enemy positions. The Mark I was a development of Little Willie, the experimental tank built for the Landships Committee by Lieutenant Walter Wilson and William Tritton in the summer of 1915. A small number of Mark I tanks took part in the battle of the Somme during the Battle of Flers-Courcelette in September 1916. They were used to cut through barbed wire to clear the way for infantry, and were even driven through houses to destroy machine gunner's emplacements.C.J. Arthur, 'True World War I Stories', page 178, Although many broke down or became stuck, almost a third that attacked made it across no mans land, and their effect on the enemy was noted, leading to a request by the British C-in-C Douglas Haig for a thousand more. The Mark II and Mark III incorporated minor improvements and changes over the Mark I with the Mark II used in the Battle of Arras in April 1917 because of delays in the production of the Mark I tank. The Mk IV incorporated thicker armour to resist German armour-piercing bullets. The Mark V had more power (150 bhp) and could be steered by one man, thanks to the epicyclic gear system created by Walter Wilson. It was first used in the Battle of Hamel on 4 July 1918 when 60 tanks contributed to a successful assault by Australian units on the German lines. During the Battle of Amiens in August 1918, several hundred of the Mark V and the lengthened Mk V* tanks, together with the new Whippet tanks, penetrated the German lines in a foretaste of modern armoured warfare. The Mark VI did not progress past the stage of a wooden mock-up; the project was cancelled in December 1917 in order that a tank co-developed with the US (the Mark VIII) could go forward. Because of technical troubles the Mark VII, almost identical to Mks I to V, had only three produced out of an order for 74 when war ended. The Mark VIII was a cooperative design between the AlliesGlanfield, Devil's Chariots, p.290 and was also known as \\"Liberty,\\" \\"International,\\" or Anglo-American tank. It did not see combat in the war but was used and upgraded until the 1930s when given to Canada for training. The Mark IX was designed in 1917 as the world's first specialised Armoured Personnel Carrier (APC). Thirty-four were completed, but none saw service. One was experimentally equipped as an armoured ambulance, and another rebuilt as an amphibious tank by the staff of the test base at Dollis Hill. There is photographic evidence that some Mk IX were used post-WWI as Infantry Carriers, but no record of their peacetime service is known to exist. The Mark X, a further improvement on the Mk V, was planned but never built. The Medium Mark A Whippet was a British tank of the First World War. It was intended to complement the slower British heavy tanks by using its relative mobility and speed in exploiting any break in the enemy lines. The Whippet tanks arrived late in the First World War, and went into action in March 1918. Alongside Mark V and V* tanks, they took part in the Amiens offensive (8 August 1918) where they broke through into the German rear areas causing the loss of the artillery in an entire front sector. A first offensive using 49 Mark I tanks took place on 15 September 1916, during the Battle of the Somme, under Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig, with limited success. Not until 20 November 1917, at Cambrai, did the British Tank Corps get the conditions it needed for success. Around 400 tanks penetrated almost six miles on a 7-mile front. This was their first large-scale deployment in combat. Unfortunately, success was not complete because the infantry failed to exploit and secure the tanks' gains. The British scored another victory the following year, on 8 August 1918, with 600 tanks in the Amiens salient. General Erich Ludendorff referred to that date as the \\"Black Day\\" of the German Army. A7V tank at Roye on March 21, 1918. The German response to the Cambrai assault was to develop its own armored program. Soon the massive A7V appeared. The A7V was a clumsy monster, weighing 30 tons with a crew of eighteen. By the end of the war, only twenty had been built. Although other tanks were on the drawing board, material shortages limited the German tank corps to these A7Vs and some captured Mark IVs. The A7V would be involved in the first tank vs. tank battle of the war on 24 April 1918 at Villers-Bretonneux—a battle in which there was no clear winner. Char Renault FT, Les Invalides. Parallel to the British development, France designed its own tanks. The first two, the medium Schneider CA and heavy Saint-Chamond, were not well-conceived, though produced in large numbers and showing technical innovations, as for the latter type a petro-electrical transmission and a long 75 mm gun. The later Renault FT was the first operational tank with a \\"modern\\" configuration: a revolving turret on top and an engine compartment in the back; it would be the most numerous tank of the war. A last development was the superheavy Char 2C, the largest tank ever built, be it some years after the armistice. WWI-era French and British tanks Numerous mechanical failures and the inability of the British and French to mount any sustained drives in the early tank actions cast doubt on their usefulness—and by 1918, tanks were extremely vulnerable unless accompanied by infantry and ground-attack aircraft, both of which worked to locate and suppress anti-tank defenses. The first American-produced heavy tank was the 43.5-ton Mark VIII, a US-British development of the successful British heavy tank design. Armed with two 6-pounder cannon and five .30-caliber machine guns, it was operated by an 11-man crew, had a maximum speed of 6.5 miles per hour, and a range of 50 miles. Production difficulties meant that none was produced before the War ended. = Between the wars = Medium Mark Cs tanks, an improvement from the Whippet Vickers Medium Mark Is on a manoeuvre somewhere in England, 1930 British Matilda I tank After the Great War, General Erich Ludendorff of the German High Command praised the Allied tanks as being a principal factor in Germany's defeat. The Germans had been too late in recognizing their value to consider them in their own plans. At a time when most soldiers regarded the tank as a specialized infantry-support weapon for crossing trenches, a significant number of officers in the Royal Tank Corps had gone on to envision much broader roles for mechanized organizations. In May 1918, Colonel J.F.C. Fuller, the acknowledged father of tank doctrine, had used the example of German infiltration tactics to refine what he called \\"Plan 1919\\". This was an elaborate concept for a large-scale armoured offensive in 1919. An outstanding achievement of the British Army was the creation of the Experimental Mechanised Force in the late 1920s. This was a small Brigade-sized unit developed to field-test the use of tanks and other vehicles. The Experimental Mechanized Force formed by the British demonstrated a mobile force with its own motor transport infantry and self-propelled guns. The unit pioneered the extensive use of radio to control widely separated small units. The unit was short-lived, however. In 1920 the Infantry had plans to acquire a Light Infantry Tank. Colonel Johnson of the Tank Design Department derived such a type from the Medium Mark D. In competition Vickers built the Vickers Light Tank.Duncan (1973), p. 2 but the project was abandoned in 1922 in favour of a generally more conventional design: the Vickers Light Tank Mark I, that would be renamed to Vickers Medium Tank Mark I in 1924 . The first prototypes were sent to Bovington for trial in 1923. The Medium Mark I replaced some of the Mark V heavy tanks; and served in the Royal Tank Regiments, being the first type of in total 200 tanks to be phased out in 1938. The Medium Mark I was the first tank to see \\"mass\\" production since the last of the ten Char 2C's had been finished in 1921. As of the next tank, the Renault NC27, only about thirty were built, the British Mediums represented most of the world tank production during the Twenties. The Medium Mark I successor, the Vickers Medium Mk II combined some of the best traits of WWI tanks into a much faster tank. It was derived from the Vickers Medium Mark I, and was developed to replace the last of the Medium Mark Cs still in use. It had a fully rotating turret on top like the FT, but mounted a dual-use 3-pounder gun (that could fire both high-explosive and anti-tank shells) with a coaxial machine gun. The Medium Mk III in use as a command vehicle Light Tank Mk II. Light Tank Mk IV. The Medium Mark III was ordered in 1928 and was reliable and provided a good gun platform. However, it suffered from a bad suspension design: even though road speed increased to thirty miles per hour, during cross-country rides the bogies were often overloaded. Three Mark IIIs were built, one by Vickers and two by the Royal Ordnance Factory at Woolwich: Medium III E1, E2 and E3. The third had an improved suspension and the vehicles were in 1934 taken into use by the HQ of the Tank Brigade. One of the Mark IIIs was fitted as a command vehicle with an extra radio aerial around the turret. This was used by Brigadier Percy Hobart for the Salisbury Plain exercises during 1934.AFV Profile British and Commonwealth Armoured Formations (1919-1946) p12 Both the cavalry and the Royal Tank Corps wanted fast, lightly armoured, mobile vehicles for reconnaissance and raiding—the light and medium (or \\"cruiser\\") tanks. In practice the \\"light tanks\\" were often small armoured personnel carriers. On the other hand, the \\"army tank battalions\\" performing the traditional infantry-support role required extremely heavy armoured protection. As a consequence of these two doctrinal roles, firepower was neglected in tank design. After World War I, the British began to produce a series of similar light tanks and developed them right up to World War II; the Light Tanks Mk II through to the Mk V. Eventually, by the 1930s, British experiments and their strategic situation led to a tank development programme with three main types of tank: light, cruiser, and infantry. The Infantry tanks were tasked with the support of dismounted infantry. The maximum speed requirement matched the walking pace of a rifleman, and the armor on these tanks was expected to be heavy enough to provide immunity to towed anti-tank guns. Armament had to be sufficient to suppress or destroy enemy machine gun positions and bunkers. Cruiser tanks were tasked with the traditional cavalry roles of pursuit and exploitation, working relatively independently of the infantry. This led to cruiser tank designs having great speed. To achieve this they were lightly armoured, and tended to carry anti-tank armament. Light Tank Mk.VIA of the 3rd King's Own Hussars. Vickers Light Tank Mk VIC knocked out during an engagement on 27 May 1940 in the Somme sector. British Vickers light tanks cross the desert, 1940 The light tanks were tasked with reconnaissance and constabulary-type colonial roles, with cheapness the major design factor. They saw use in training, and in limited engagements with British Empire units such as the South African Army during the East African Campaign against forces of the Italian Empire. Up until the Mk V, they had a crew of two: a driver/commander and gunner. The Mk V had a crew of three: a driver, a gunner, and the commander helping on the gun. The light tanks were kept in use for training until around 1942. Some saw active use in the Western Desert Campaign or Abyssinia. They were followed by the Light Tank Mk VI from 1936. The Mk VI Light Tank, was the sixth in the line of light tanks built by Vickers- Armstrongs for the British Army during the interwar period. The company had achieved a degree of standardization with their previous five models, and the Mark VI was identical in all but a few respects. Production of the Mk VI began in 1936 and ended in 1940 with approximately 1,000 Mark VI tanks having been built. When the Mk VI was first produced in 1936, the Imperial General Staff considered the tank to be superior to any light tank produced by other nations, and well suited to the dual roles of reconnaissance and colonial warfare. Like many of its predecessors, the Mark VI was used by the British Army to perform imperial policing duties in British India and other colonies in the British Empire, a role for which it and the other Vickers-Armstrongs light tanks were found to be well suited.Bishop p.23Tucker, p. 48 When the British government began its rearmament process in 1937, the Mk VI was the only tank with which the War Office was ready to proceed with manufacturing; the development of a medium tank for the Army had hit severe problems after the cancellation of the proposed \\"Sixteen Tonner\\" medium tank in 1932 due to the costs involved, and cheaper models only existed as prototypes with a number of mechanical problems. As a result of this, when the Second World War began in September 1939, the vast majority of the tanks available to the British Army were Mk VIs - there were 1,002 Mk VI Light Tanks. The British and Commonwealth forces employed a relatively small number of these light tanks and armoured vehicles in East Africa against the forces of the Italian Empire from June 1940 to November 1941. For the most part, an assortment of armoured cars was used. However, B Squadron 4th Royal Tank Regiment did include small number of Matilda II infantry tanks. Cruiser Mk I (A9) Cruiser Mk II (A10) A Cruiser Mk III (A13) A Cruiser Mk IV tank. In 1934 the best features of the earlier Mk III light tank were incorporated into a cruiser tank design. Sir John Carden of Vickers-Armstrong produced this new tank, to General Staff specification A9, which was subsequently accepted as the Cruiser Tank Mark I. A prototype was tested in 1936 and it went into production the following year, 125 examples being produced in 1937 and 1938. The follow-up to the A9, the A10, was also designed by Carden. Designated as a \\"heavy cruiser\\" tank, it was put into production in July 1938. It resembled the Cruiser Mk I, but had heavier armour, and was one of the first British tanks with Spaced armour and the first to be equipped with the Besa machine gun. Orders for the Mk I and Mk II Cruisers were restricted, since the British Army had already decided to produce a more advanced and faster cruiser tank which would incorporate the Christie suspension acquired from the American inventor J. Walter Christie and have better armour. In 1936, General Martel, a pioneer in tank design who had published works on armoured warfare and pioneered the lightly armoured \\"tankette\\" to enhance infantry mobility, became Assistant Director of Mechanization at the War Office. Earlier that year Martel had witnessed demonstrations of Soviet tank designs including the BT tank, which had been influenced by Christie's work. He urged the adoption of a tank that would use the suspension system and also follow Christie's practice of using a lightweight aircraft engine such as the Liberty Engine. The government authorized purchase and licensing of a Christie design via the newly formed Nuffield Mechanisation and Aero. The vehicle obtained from Christie became the basis of the Cruiser Mk III (General Staff number A13 Mk 1) though Christie's tank required extensive redesign as it was too small. Following testing of two prototypes, the A13 was ordered into production and a total of 65 were manufactured. The Mk III weighed \`14 long tons (14.2 metric tonnes), had a crew of four, a 340 hp engine which gave a top speed of and was armed with a 2 pounder gun and a machine gun. However, when it was introduced into service in 1937, the Army still lacked a formal tank division. The Cruiser Mk IV (A13 Mk II) was a more heavily armoured version of the Mk III and was used in some of the early campaigns of the war.  World War II  = Fall of France = The trainee driver of a Medium Tank MkIII in 1940. British Matilda I tank By the time World War Two had come around, the design of the tank had shifted from its uses as a terrain covering vehicle, and the full potential of the tank as an armoured, combat vehicle had been realised. Since the infantry tanks were to work at the pace of the infantry units, which would be attacking on foot, high speed was not a requirement and they were able to carry heavier armour. The Infantry Tank came about as a result of a 1934 requirement by the General Staff for a tank that would directly support an infantry attack. Armament would consist of a machine gun and an overall speed of a walking man when moving. Vickers designed an inexpensive (cost was a serious consideration) pilot which was delivered and accepted in 1936. Although heavily armoured it was slow and under-armed. Most would be lost or left behind in France. The first purpose-designed infantry tanks were the Matilda I armed with a machine- gun and Matilda II, which was armed with a machine gun and a QF 2 pounder anti-tank gun. It was quickly seen that the Matilda I, with only a machine gun, was inadequate for its intended role. The second Matilda was ordered directly off the drawing board in 1937. During its production years of 1940 to 1943, 2,987 of these sturdy tanks were built. Though small, the tank presented a massive appearance due to its armoured skirts and cast armour. The Matilda 2 totally dominated all Italian armour and could claim title to \\"Queen of the Desert\\" until the arrival of German tanks in North Africa. The British Army were pioneers in tank combat but by 1939 it could be argued they were behind the times in terms of strategy and tactics, their methods based on the trench warfare of World War I. The British Army entered World War II with an array of poor designs and hobbled by poor doctrine. According to the theories of Captain BH Liddell Hart and Major-General Sir Percy Hobart, they split their tank force into two groups; Infantry tanks and Cruiser tanks. British tank use focused on cavalry-type missions and infantry support without the focus on the combined-arms tactics that dominated German and later Soviet thinking. A damaged Cruiser Mk I CS abandoned in Calais, 1940. The result was a series of under-armed, mechanically unreliable designs such as the A9 which Sir John Carden of Vickers-Armstrong produced in 1934 and A10 and Crusader (A15) cruiser tanks, and the Matilda (A11) also by Vickers-Armstrongs Ltd, began in 1935 and Matilda II (A12) infantry tanks, and a series of deathtrap light tanks, the Light Tank Mk I built earlier by Vickers Armstrong from 1929, up to the Light Tank Mk V produced during 1936, that were suitable for reconnaissance work only.

The Matilda Mk I, (A11) and Matilda II (A12) infantry tanks fought together in France as part of the 1st Army Tank Brigade of the British Expeditionary Force in the Battle of France. They participated in the defence and counter-attack operation at Arras against the invasion by Nazi Germany in May 1940, temporarily discomfiting the 7th Panzer Division under Rommel. In the battle, elements of motorized SS regiment \\"Totenkopf\\" (later to be expanded into SS-Division Totenkopf)—were overrun, their standard PaK 36/37 anti-tank guns proving ineffective against the heavily armoured British Matilda tank. Rommel committed some of his armour to local counterattacks, only to find the guns of the Panzer II and Panzer 38(t) tanks could not penetrate the Matildas' armour. Desperate to prevent a British breakthrough, Rommel ordered the division's FlaK 18 anti-aircraft guns and field guns be formed into a defensive line and fire anti-tank and HE rounds in a last-ditch effort to stop the Matildas, and this stopped the British tanks. The attack made the German commanders nervous, and the battle is historically credited with shaking the confidence of the German High Command (OKW) and it may have been one of the factors for the surprise German halt on 24 May that gave the BEF the slimmest of opportunities to begin evacuation from Dunkirk. The main British force consisted of only 58 machine gun armed Matilda Is and 16 QF 2-pounder gun armed Matilda IIs supported by a few lighter armoured vehicles. Secondary Campaigns A British Cruiser Mk II disabled by having lost a track (seen lower right) in Greece, 1941. A Cruiser Mk IV tank destroyed in the North African Campaign. The Mk I (A9) cruiser was used in the French, Greek and early North African campaigns. Sixty British Cruiser Mk II's went to Greece with the 3rd Royal Tank Regiment and fought against the German tanks, but over 90% suffered mechanical breakdowns as opposed to enemy action. The Cruiser Mk III saw action in Greece and early North African campaigns where they equipped units of the 7th Armoured Division. The Cruiser Mk IV tank saw action in the French and early North African campaigns. The Cruiser tank Mk V Covenanter was first cruiser tank design to be given a name, and never deployed outside the British Isles. They first were used to re-equip the British 1st Armoured Division after the Fall of France. Cruiser tank Mk V Covenanters of the 2nd (Armoured) Irish Guards, Guards Armoured Division Crusader Mk III The Crusader tanks became the main British tank, the A15 Crusader Mark I and II variants had QF 2 pounder (40mm) main gun, but the 'Crusader III' was fitted with an Ordnance QF 6 pounder (57mm) main gun. It used the same main turret as the A13 Mk III Covenanter designs, and over 5,000 tanks were manufactured. The A15 Crusader Mark 111 and Mark IV finally replaced most tanks in the British forces after the fall of France and was used extensively during the North African Campaign. = Desert Campaign = A A12 Infantry Tank Mark II best known as Matilda II advancing through Egypt as part of Operation Compass.

A Valentine in North Africa, carrying infantry from a Scottish regiment Churchill tanks of 'Kingforce' during the 2nd Battle of El Alamein When the BEF returned to the United Kingdom, nearly all their armour was left behind and the remaining Matilda Mk Is were withdrawn. The Matilda II was used up to early 1942, in the war in North Africa, the Matilda II proved highly effective against Italian tanks, although vulnerable again to the larger calibre and medium calibre anti-tank guns. When the German Afrika Korps arrived in North Africa, the anti-aircraft gun was again pressed into the anti-tank role against the Matilda, causing heavy losses, and, by the time of the Second Battle of El Alamein in October 1942, few Matildas were still in service. Combat experience against the Germans in the Western Desert Campaign demonstrated to the British many shortcomings with their cruiser tanks. The Cruiser Mk I was an effective tank in the French, Greek and early North African campaigns. The 2 pdr gun was lethal against the primitive Italian tanks encountered first during the North African campaign, but was, at best, a mediocre weapon against the modern German armor of the Afrika Korps. The heavier Cruiser, Mk II (A10), were part of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) sent to France in the early stages of World War II. Their cross-country performance was initially recorded as poor but they were still used later in North Africa at the defence of Tobruk in 1941, where reliability and suspension performance in the desert conditions was praised. Hence a request was made in 1941 to the Nuffield Organisation's subsidiary and Leyland Motors for a new heavy cruiser tank that could achieve battle superiority over German models. With the A34 Specification later called \\"Comet\\" the tank designers were to use a new gun, the \\"77mm HV\\". This gun used the same calibre (76.2 mm) projectiles as the 17-pounder but the shell casing was from the older QF 3 inch 20 cwt gun (loaded to higher pressures) permitting a smaller gun that could be readily fitted into a tank. The A34 Comet began to be delivered by September 1944. Intended to be in service by December 1944, crew training was delayed by the German Ardennes Offensive. By the end of the war, 1,200 had been produced. They were followed by the Valentine tank (Infantry Tank Mk III) and Churchill tank (Infantry Tank Mk IV). Designed using the interior and chassis layout of the experimental A10, the Valentine met an emergency 1938 requirement for a tank to supplement the Matilda. Ordered \\"off the drawing board\\" in 1939, by the time production ceased in 1944, some 8,275 of these sturdy tanks had been built. Considered stable and reliable by its crews, the tank was only hampered by its small size. Unlike the Matilda tanks, this model allowed the later fitting of a larger main gun but at the expense of operating a two-man turret. The initial riveted construction soon was replaced by welding. The Valentine proved to be difficult to develop further but the Churchill went through successive variants and served up to the end of the war. The early Churchills were fraught with mechanical defects and required many changes before they were considered sound. The army had this machine designed to meet a possible need for a tank to operate in a \\"shelled area\\" on the Western Front which in 1939 was expected to eventually look like 1918. The initial A20 design was not successful which caused Vauxhall to take over from Harland and Wolff. The Vauxhall design was called the A22 and the first production vehicles were delivered around the middle of 1941. Eventually, the teething problems were resolved and the tank went on to become one of the best tanks in the army. The tank was refined into many special roles, mostly with the Royal Engineers. The tank had excellent weight distribution and was considered very stable in movement. As British cruiser tank designs developed into larger tanks with more powerful engines, they could carry larger guns and more armour yet still achieved high speeds. At the end of the war the cruiser tank lineage led to the \\"universal tank\\" in the form of the Centurion. Centurion tank A British M3 (Stuart I) knocked out during fighting in North Africa. Stuart tanks of the 8th King's Royal Irish Hussars in North Africa, August 1941. In practice the British did not operate only infantry and cruiser tanks. Lack of production capacity meant the large scale adoption of US medium tanks. The Cruiser Mk I was an effective tank in the French, Greek and early North African campaigns. The 2 pdr gun was lethal against the primitive Italian tanks encountered during the North African campaign, but was, at best, a mediocre weapon against the modern German armor of the Afrika Korps. Engaging the more thinly armored flanks and rear of German tanks was generally the only way to have any effect. The minimal armor made the A9 an easy kill for most German anti-tank weapons. Also problematic was the lack of High Explosive shells for the 2 pdr gun and even worse the lack of AP for the 95 mm gun on the Close Support version. Another issue was that the areas around the front machine gun turrets created a frontal surface that was more vulnerable to enemy fire than it would have been had it been a flat plate, let alone a sloped glacis. A number of Cruiser Mark IIs were part of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) sent to France in the early stages of World War II. The A10 cross country performance was recorded as poor, but they were still used later in North Africa at the defence of Tobruk in 1941, where reliability and suspension performance in the desert conditions was praised. Sixty worn out examples were taken to Greece, by the 3rd Royal Tank Regiment and although they performed well against the German tanks, over 90% were lost due to mechanical breakdowns as opposed to enemy action (mainly tracks).See Robert Crisp, Brazen Chariots (W.W. Norton & Co. 2005), at 15. (See \\"A Tankie's Travels\\" By Robert Watt ) The bright spots of British tank design included the Valentine, Churchill (A22), Cromwell (A27M), and Comet I (A34), which together made up a little over half of total British tank production during WWII. The Valentine was a reliable, heavily armoured infantry-support tank used successfully in the desert and by the Red Army as a light tank. The Churchill had heavy armour and good off-road capability. The Cromwell was in most respects the equal of the early model Sherman of the United States or the German Panzer IV, though by the time of its first major deployment in France in the summer of 1944, it was unremarkable compared to many other vehicles being fielded by then, its best advantage being its speed and mobility. The Comet was a design that improved on the Cromwell, fielded in the final months of the war with a modified, slightly less powerful, variant of the 17pdr, known as the 77mm QF. As a stop- gap, the Challenger (A30) Cruiser Tank, mounted a 17 Pounder gun on a lengthened Cromwell chassis with an extra road wheel each side and a widened hull centre section. From June 1944, it added heavier anti-tank firepower to cruiser tank reconnaissance units until the Comet became widely available. = US imports = British Grant (left) and Lee (right) tanks in the Egyptian desert. Beginning about 1942, most British tank units were equipped with vehicles supplied from the United States, such as the Stuart light tank, the Lee (or the Grant variant thereof) and the Lee's/Grant's replacement, the Sherman. The Stuart tanks were the first to come in with the 8th Hussars, and were part of the force of the 1st Armoured Division and also were part of the 4th Armoured Brigade and used for Operation Crusader. = D-Day = British Cromwell tank Mk IV Churchill (A22) Infantry tank Valentine DD tank with screen lowered and gun pointing towards the rear of the vehicle. British Challenger (A30) tank British A34 Comet tank Comet tanks of the 2nd Fife and Forfar Yeomanry, 11th Armoured Division, crossing the Weser at Petershagen, Germany, 7 April 1945 Immediately before and during the war, the British produced an enormous array of prototype tanks and modified tanks for a variety of specialist tasks (see Hobart's Funnies). For example, the Churchill AVRE mounted a 290 mm (11.4\\") direct-fire mortar which was used for destroying buildings and clearing obstacles. Responsibility for the buildup of vehicles and the training of crews to use them was given to armoured warfare expert Percy Hobart after whom the collection was named. Many of the ideas had already been tried, tested or were in experimental development both by Britain and other nations. For example, the Scorpion flail tank (a modified Matilda tank) had already been used during the North African campaign to clear paths through German minefields. Soviet T-34 tanks had been modified with mine- rollers. Close-support tanks, bridgelayers, and fascine carriers had been developed elsewhere also. However, the Funnies were the largest and most elaborate collection of engineering vehicles available. By early 1944, Hobart could demonstrate to Eisenhower and Montgomery a brigade each of swimming DD tanks, Crab mine clearers, and AVRE (Engineer) tanks along with a regiment of Crocodile flamethrowing tanks. Montgomery considered that the U.S. forces should use them, and offered them a half-share of all the vehicles available, but take-up was minimal. Eisenhower was in favour of the amphibious tanks but left the decision on the others to Lieutenant General Omar Bradley, then commanding the U.S. First Army, who delegated it to his staff officers. Sherman Firefly – Hamburg 1945 The British at Normandy were re-equipped with some of the newer British and American tanks and a few days after D-Day, the Armoured Reconnaissance regiment of the 7th Armoured Division landed at Le Hamel on Gold Beach with Cromwell tanks and began going into action almost immediately in the fighting around Villers-Bocage. The tanks were used in the advance through the Bocage with the 22nd Armoured Brigade. They were involved in action against the 2nd Panzer Division, with the tanks leading the way out of the bridgehead. Early Cold War During the Cold War (1945–1990), the two opposing forces in Europe were the Warsaw Pact countries on the one side, and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries on the other side. Soviet domination of the Warsaw Pact led to effective standardization on a few tank designs. In comparison, the main NATO countries, Britain, France, Germany, and the USA, developed their own tank designs with little in common, and the smaller counties generally adopted one or more of these designs. British main battle tank Centurion Mk3. For the UK regiments, the Centurion was the primary British tank of the post-World War II period. Development of the tank began in 1943 and manufacture of the Centurion began in January 1945. It first entered combat with the British Army in the Korean War in 1950, in support of the UN forces. It was noted for its high mobility, able to climb to the top of hills that were considered difficult for infantry, let alone tanks. Upgraded to mount the L7 105 mm gun, it became the UK's first main battle tank. Between 1946 and 1962, 4,423 Centurions were produced, consisting of 13 basic marks and numerous variants. Conqueror Mk 2 At first, the Centurion was not considered capable of dealing with all Soviet tanks on its own, and it was joined by a traditional heavy tank design, the Conqueror. This design was almost as heavy as the German WWII King Tigers, and was tasked with dealing with the heavy Soviet designs like the Joseph Stalin IS-3.Ford, World's Great Tanks, p. 119 They were issued at nine for each regiment in Germany; usually grouped in three tank troops. It used the American 120 mm gun and was expected to give long range firepower and support to the Centurion tanks that made up the bulk of British tank force. To provide even more firepower for the British Army of the Rhine tank units, a variant of the Cromwell tank with a 20 pounder gun was deployed. It was a defensive weapon, in practice more a self-propelled anti-tank gun. This hodge-podge of designs was far from ideal, and there were ongoing efforts to improve the Centurion. When equipped with the L7 105 mm gun, along with greatly improved shells, the Centurion was able to penetrate even the heaviest Soviet designs. It became the truly \\"Universal tank\\" it had originally intended to be, and began to displace other designs in service. With future combat thought to be dominated by nuclear weapons, which were thought to render armor as ineffective as infantry, development of newer tank designs began to wane. Instead, designs like the Centurion continued to be improved with the addition of better fire control, stabilization and NBC protection. Destroyed Israeli Centurion The Centurion would go on to be one of the most widely used tank designs, equipping armies around the world. Between 1946 and 1962, 4,423 Centurions were produced, consisting of 13 basic marks and numerous variants. As recently as the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict the Israel Defense Forces employed heavily modified Centurions as armoured personnel carriers and combat engineering vehicles. South Africa still employs over 200 Centurions. Later cold war to today FV4201 Chieftain Challenger 1 tank. While the L7 equipped Centurion was an excellent tank, improvements in gunnery and especially drivetrains made it possible to equip a tank with the protection and firepower of the Conqueror with the mobility of Centurion. Leyland began experiments on such a design as early as 1956 with early prototypes in 1959. This emerged as the Chieftain, one of the most heavily armed and armored tanks of its era, and one of the most modern designs in any force of the era. From this point the Army forces relied on single designs, adopting the main battle tank concept whole heartedly. Iranian orders for an improved Chieftain led to what were initially relatively minor upgrades, but the development of Chobham armour in the 1960s led to the design of a new tank combining a wide variety of improvements, the Challenger. Among its many improvements, the Challenger used a laser rangefinder in a highly automated fire control system, an improved engine, a greatly improved suspension that offered far better offroad performance. Entering service in 1983, it was beaten into NATO service by the M-1 Abrams, which also used Chobham armour. Challenger 2 Tank of the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards (Squadron D) during live fire training exercises. Almost immediately after the Chieftain entered development, the West German government began collaborating with the British on a new tank design combining features of the Chieftain with a number of new concepts. Development officially began in September 1978 with the aim of introducing a new design in the late 1980s that would replace both British and German designs. This project fell apart, but a number of experimental design concepts were then worked into the Challenger 2, which first entered service in July 1994. The Challenger 2 forms the core of the Army's heavy tank units today. The Challenger 2 is the main tank currently being used today by the British military in combat situations. It is renowned for its durability and endurance. Only one has ever been recorded as destroyed, of which was due to a friendly fire incident involving another Challenger 2 tank. This is possibly due to the use of Chobham armour for the Challenger's outer armour. Chobham armour is an incredibly tough armour, the details of which still remain secret to the developers. It uses layers of ceramics and other materials, combined in such a way as to withstand extreme heat and impact.Jorgensen, Christer and Mann Chris, Tank Warfare: Strategy and Tactics-The Illustrated History of the Tank at War 1914-2000, The History Press LTD (2001: UK)  Recent and current conflicts  = Gulf War = Ground operations during Operation Desert Storm, showing the 1st Armoured Divisions movements.

The brigade, led by the 1st Fusiliers Battlegroup, made a rapid advance towards the city and soon reached its outskirts, securing Basra Airport and the critical bridges across the Shatt al-Arab. The advance by the brigade met sporadic though fierce resistance, with The Queen's Royal Irish Hussars, including an engagement between 14 Challenger 2s of the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards and 14 Iraqi tanks, all of the Iraqi tanks being destroyed; it was the largest tank engagement by the British Army since WWII.British troops move into Basra The Guardian, 7 April 2003 The 1st Armoured Division, including 7th Brigade, then undertook a number of raids into the city against specific targets, and the Desert Rats, led by Challenger 2s of the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards, Queen's Royal Lancers and 2nd Royal Tank Regiment with Warriors of the 1st Fusiliers, Irish Guards and Black Watch pushed into the city on 6 April and stayed. Basra was, for the most part, now controlled by 1st Division though further engagements did take place. The war was officially declared over on 1 May. The Desert Rats remained in Iraq after the war, acting as peacekeepers and helping to rebuild the country while based in the British sector in the south of Iraq. The brigade began to leave in late June, being replaced by 19th Mechanised Brigade. All of the remaining British troops were fully withdrawn from Iraq after the Iraqi government refused to extend their mandate.

Although they are the latest in a long series of protest actions by Kurds in Turkey, they are strongly influenced by the concurrent popular protests throughout the Middle East and North Africa, and the Turkish publication Hürriyet Daily News has suggested that the popularly dubbed \\"Arab Spring\\" that has seen revolutions in Egypt and Tunisia may lead to a \\"Kurdish Summer\\" in the northern reaches of the Middle East. Protesters have taken to the streets both in İstanbul and in southeast Turkey, with some demonstrations also reported as far west in Anatolia as İzmir. From 24 March and 10 May, a total of 2 protesters were killed, 308 injured and 2,506 detained by Turkish authorities. The protests declined in July after a new breakout of violence between state forces and Kurdistan Workers' Party rebels. Background There are currently 14 to 20 million Kurds in Turkey, living predominantly in the southeast of the country. The Kurdish people are a unique ethnic group with their own language and customs. In Turkey, the Kurdish uprising dates back to at least 1925, but the most recent major rebellion started in 1978 and has crossed the border into adjacent Iraqi Kurdistan on a number of occasions. Over 3,000 Kurdish villages have been \\"evacuated\\" by the Turkish armed forces since the conflict began. The Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a Kurdish separatist group listed as a terrorist organization by the governments of Turkey and the United States, demands autonomy for Turkish Kurdistan. It has also called upon Turkish authorities to release Kurdish prisoners and detainees, overturn a ban on Kurdish-language education, and cease military action against Kurdish groups. In 2009, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan launched a \\"Kurdish initiative\\" aiming to broaden cultural rights for Kurds, but many Kurdish protesters have said this does not go far enough.Kurdish rebels end Turkey 'truce' – Middle East – Al Jazeera English On 28 February 2011, the PKK announced an end to a unilateral ceasefire it had declared in August 2010, prompting Erdoğan to comment on the pro-Kurdish Peace and Democracy Party (BDP) over its alleged collusion with the militant group. \\"A political party that is in Parliament hurling out threats ... during every election period puts pressure on people who want to exercise their democratic will and serves no other purpose,\\" the prime minister said. =Censorship= Internet censorship is practiced by the government of Turkey. A number of websites, including those of pro-Kurdish and alternative news outlets such as Voice of America, Bianet, and Azadiya Welat, are subject to a filter imposed by the Turkish Council of State. Bianet reported that according to new regulations adopted by the government in late February, this filter will be expanded from blocking access to certain websites from Internet cafés to affect all Internet access points and ISPs in Turkey sometime in the near future. On 13 March 2011, The New York Times reported a turnout of \\"thousands\\" for a march in İstanbul protesting censorship of the press and the arrest of over a dozen journalists by Turkish authorities since the start of the month. The Turkish media advocacy group Freedom to Journalists Platform said Turkey held 68 journalists as of mid- March, including many on charges of \\"inciting public hatred\\" and similar offenses, though the government maintains only 27 journalists are incarcerated on unrelated charges. Timeline =Main Phase= March ;24 March In a statement published online on 24 March, the Peace and Democracy Party (BDP) announced the immediate beginning of a civil disobedience campaign, beginning with a strike and sit-in in Diyarbakır, the largest city in the Kurdish region. The government responded by deploying soldiers and Army vehicles to break up the unsanctioned demonstration, which drew about 3,000 participants. Just a fraction of these participants—a few dozen MPs and Kurdish city officials, including the mayor of Diyarbakır—were permitted to proceed to the sit-in venue, while thousands more demonstrators thronged outside and shouted angry slogans. Police clashed with demonstrators, some of whom attempted to attack officers with fireworks, and detained five. A similar scene erupted in Batman, where a larger number of protesters were reportedly detained and protest tents were forcibly taken down. ;27 March Demonstrations spread to İstanbul, İzmir, Silopi, and Antalya by 27 March. Protest camps also sprang up in Tunceli, Muş, Van, and Ağrı. Several dozen protesters were arrested. Protest leader and MP Selahattin Demirtaş said that the Peace and Democracy Party was determined to carry out civil disobedience actions across the Kurdish region and condemned the governor of Diyarbakır Province for declaring the protests unlawful. Fellow Kurdish leader Ahmet Türk said they will continue the sit-in action despite the pressure from the Turkish authorities. \\"The prime minister who sends greetings to Tahrir Square while sending tanks and gas bombs at us should know that the [Kurdish] people have been seeking their freedom in their [own] Tahrir Squares,\\" said Demirtaş, referring to Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and his favorable stance toward Egyptian revolutionaries. ;28 March About 40,000 people marched to the alleged site of mass graves of Kurds in Siirt Province on 28 March. The protest march spun off into rioting in the province. In Batman and Diyarbakır, two of the original sites of protests as part of the civil disobedience campaign, media reported Turkish security forces detained several more protesters. April ;6 April Demirtaş ratcheted up the civil disobedience campaign by Kurdish protesters on 6 April by accusing imams sent by the government to lead prayers in Turkey's southeast of supporting and spying for the ruling Justice and Development Party and urging Kurds not to pray behind them. Demirtaş also said that sermons in Kurdish parts of the country should only be given in Kurdish, a policy Erdoğan opposes. ;8 April At Friday prayers in Diyarbakır on 8 April, a number of Kurds boycotted in solidarity with the BDP, with many holding signs and banners supporting Demirtaş and the protests as others prayed. At least one newspaper ran photographs of the boycott. ;11 April On 11 April, the conservative Turkish weekly Aksiyon published allegations that \\"militant imams\\" loyal to the PKK intend to promote terrorism among Kurds by portraying PKK fighters killed in clashes with government forces as martyrs. According to the report, imprisoned PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan devised the plan from behind bars. It also alleged that the banned PKK is using the BDP as a political front. ;19 April On 19 April, Turkey's elections board ruled that 12 Kurdish politicians who had registered as independent candidates were barred from running in the June parliamentary elections. The politicians included Leyla Zana, who has spent ten years in prison for alleged PKK membership despite a ruling by the European Court of Human Rights that her imprisonment violated freedom of speech.Leyla Zana and 11 other Kurdish politicians barred from running for Turkish parliament Kurds angry over the ban rallied in Hakkâri, Şırnak, İstanbul, Van, and Diyarbakır. More than 2,000 protesters gathered in Taksim Square on the European side of İstanbul, Turkey's largest city. Police used tear gas to disperse the protest, which reportedly injured several, including at least one police officer. Shopkeepers and workers went on strike in Hakkâri and Van. Van also saw clashes between protesters and Turkish gendarmes, with its Kurdish mayor being among the demonstrators injured in the fighting, and scuffles were also reported in Diyarbakır, where a 15-year-old boy was reportedly hospitalized after being shot and injured by police. The semi-official Anatolian Agency claimed significant property damage in the city of Diyarbakır and said police confiscated several Molotov cocktails brought to the demonstration by Kurdish protesters. ;20 April On 20 April, police fired live rounds at protesters in Bismil. One protester was killed, four were injured, and at least 16 were arrested. The incident drew outrage from the Kurdish community, with Selahattin Demirtaş canceling a planned meeting with President Abdullah Gül in Ankara over the shooting. ;21 April The elections board reversed its decision to bar several Kurdish political candidates on 21 April after facing massive outcry. Some journalists expected this to be the end of intensified protests and rioting.

National Underwriter Property & Casualty-Risk & Benefits Management Journal, 1993, p. 46. They are also a resource where consumers can find scam warnings, learn where to report fraud, and how to protect themselves. The Coalition was founded in 1993 after several organizations reported a heavy rise in insurance fraud and a need to stop it.  History  In 1993, insurance fraud investigators staged several bus crashes in New Jersey. The only passengers in the busses were fraud investigators. After the crash, they received over 100 claims from people who jumped on the bus after it crashed or simply drove by the scene and wanted to claim insurance money saying they were injured. In response to this problem, seventeen organizations formed The Coalition Against Insurance Fraud, contributing $500,000 to finance anti-fraud efforts. At the time, The Coalition estimated that auto fraud cost over $8 billion a year in overpaid claims. Since then, The Coalition has grown to include over 90 members, including GEICO, National Consumers League, First Acceptance Corp., Healthcare Insight, Property Casualty Insurers Assoc. of America, SAS Institute, Thomson Reuters, Nationwide, and the Virginia State Police.  Mission  The Coalition's main mission is to fight insurance fraud. The Coalition seeks to unite and empower private and public groups against fraud. Members work to control insurance costs, protect public safety, and reduce crime. Three main areas of activity are: Government Affairs * To enact stronger anti-fraud laws through local and grassroots campaigns * Create model bills. For example, establishing insurance fraud as a specific crime. * Strengthen anti-fraud bills * Hold major summits * Support prosecutions Communication * Raise public awareness of insurance fraud, and how public can fight back * Empower and alert consumers * Unite outreach efforts Research * Sponsor major research and surveyshttp://www.insurancefraud.org/research.htm  Publications  * Journal of Insurance Fraud in America (JIFA), a quarterly publication containing in-depth analysis of trends, research, and public policy issues that may impact anti-fraud efforts * FraudWire, two quarterly digital publications reporting on important developments involving legislative activity and public awareness * Fraud News Weekly, a paid digital publication summarizing weekly trends on legislative and regulatory developments, state and federal court decisions, public outreach and media coverage, the week's fraud arrests, the latest convictions for insurance fraud, civil cases, administrative actions, upcoming meetings, seminars & conferences. * Get a Grip on Fraud: Fraud Awareness Manual, an action guide for creating memorable fraud-awareness eventsCoalition, Staff. “Get a Grip on Fraud”, December 2009, Washington D.C.

Among them: * Effectiveness of warnings on benefit checks, in 2000, selected insurance companies writing workers compensation coverage in the United States were surveyed to determine their experience and perceptions with printed warnings on the back of benefit checks.Jay, Dennis, Effectiveness of warnings on benefit checks”, October 2000 * Four faces: why Americans do and don't tolerate fraud, to understand why people accept fraud, and why individuals sometimes won't report fraud even though they understand fraud raises everyone's premiums. Study includes focus groups and statistical survey. conducted to gain insight on why public tolerance of insurance fraud seems to be increasing. Both qualitative and quantitive research was used to attempt to understand how public attitudes about fraud are formed and what factors influence them. * Insurer fraud measurement, a survey completed by 65 Special Investigative Unit managers, mostly from property/casualty insurers, on their practices involving measuring anti-fraud activities for case referrals, fraud savings and performance evaluations of investigators.Coalition, Staff. “Insurer Fraud Measurement”, December 2004 * Prescription for Peril, examining unreported and elusive aspects of drug diversion, the role insurance fraud pays in financing prescription abuse, and the high cost to insurers and consumers.Coalition, Staff. “Prescription for Peril”, December 2007 * Special Investigative Unit study, conducted to learn how insurers measure the performance of their Special Investigative Units.

Fraud Warnings  The Coalition issues scam alerts for common schemes, elaborating on variations and best measures for prevention and defense. Among the topics: * Agents and insurers: Though most insurers and agents are honest, the Coalition warns against agents who pocket their clients' premiums, sell insurance that is fake or unnecessary, or provide unneeded coverage to boost premiums. * Airbags: Counterfeit airbags have been flooding the markets and posing a deadly threat to innocent motorists. * Auto repairs: Auto repair scams have been known to involve purposely damaging cars in order to inflate repair costs, padding existing repairs, or cutting corners by doing low- quality work. * Bogus health plans: A tough economy can make individuals more vulnerable to buying too-good-to-be-true insurance plans * Contractors & adjusters: The Coalition warns against fraudulent contractors who appear after natural disasters to offer repairs, fraudulent contractors may add damage to increase costs, illegally lower deductibles, receive pay and disappear, or do work without a license. * Dental: Dental schemes often involve billing for treatment that was never provided, or providing treatment that was not needed * Discount medical cards: these cards offer discounted medical treatment or pills, but fake cards may provide no coverage or discounts * Drug diversion. The abuse of prescription drugs. * Medical identity theft: Medical identity schemes involve stealing someone's social security number, medicare number, medicaid number, and other identifying information in order to file insurance claims on their behalf for illegal gain. * Staged auto crashes: The Coalition warns against people who claim nonexistent injuries after crashes in order to exploit their insurance coverage, fraudsters may purposely crash into unsuspecting drivers, or stage a crash that is entirely set-up in person or on paper. * Workers' compensation: The Coalition warns against employers who do not purchase adequate coverage for their employees, and employees who fake injuries for paid time off.

Course The water course becomes known as the Cadoxton just north of Dinas Powys village near the hamlet of Michaelston-le-Pit, at the confluence of the Wrinstone Brook and the Bullcroft Brook. From there, it flows in a generally south-westerly direction through Dinas Powys, along the route of the A4055, or Cardiff Road, towards the town of Barry. Once at Barry, it flows through an artificial channel towards its manmade estuary at The Bendricks, Vale of Glamorgan.Cadoxton River History Although the river is but a stream today, it appeared to have had a greater flow in times gone by - large enough to appear on some maps of Britain. Some small vessels could almost reach Dinas Powys, but, like the River Thaw a few miles west, it is likely to have silted up, and the mouth became a mud channel before being redeveloped. The lower reaches of the river have been extensively modified in the past. In 1884, the Barry Railway Company began construction work on the Barry docks, which were cut into the natural estuary of the river, which was diverted away. The lower river should be tidal, but a sluice gate built at the same time as the docks keeps the water fresh. From the 1940s through to the 1970s, the bottom stretches of the Cadoxton were polluted by effluents from the many chemical plants nearby. However, due to environmental regulation the water quality is now improving and the river supports fish, including trout. On 19 April 2005, most of the river's trout were killed when dangerous pollutants leaked from a vehicle travelling to the Barry chemical plants, seeping into Bullcroft Brook and thus damaging the ecosystem. 183 dead fish were found in a 5 km stretch of the river and the company, a division of Calor Gas Ltd, was fined £20,000. Etymology Despite its name, the river does not flow through the town of Cadoxton any more. In the past, however, it did flow through the centre of Barry. At high tide, small boats could sail up into Barry. Originally it met the sea at the eastern edge of Barry Island, where the present dock entrance is situated today. Barry Island ceased to be an island when the river was diverted away and the docks constructed. Tributaries Along its short course, a few smaller streams join the river. =Bullcroft Brook= Bullcroft Brook rises near Caerau, south of the A4232 road. It is just under 2 miles long, and flows southward to join the Wrinstone Brook at Michaelston-le-Pit. On 19 April 2005 the stream was polluted when a vehicle carrying styrene monomer lost 620 litres of the chemical, which heavy rains carried to Bullcroft Brook. The trout in the river system suffered as a result. =Wrinstone Brook= Wrinstone Brook is the larger of the two main tributaries of the river, flowing eastwards for 3 miles. It rises from multiple sources around Wenvoe and flows near the tiny cluster of houses at Wrinstone. It flows through a wooded ravine for much of its course, and just upstream from the confluence with Bullcroft Brook, several weirs dam the river, creating many ponds. These are known locally as the Seven Lakes, or alternatively the Salmon Leaps, despite the fact that they are used as a trout farm. =East Brook= The East Brook is a smaller tributary of the river. It starts at Llandough, flowing for 2 miles before joining the Cadoxton south of the A4055 at Dinas Powys. It flows through the area of Dinas known as the Murch, and also the area called Eastbrook, to which it gave its name. =Coldbrook= The Coldbrook rises in the Merthyr Dyfan area of Barry, and is 4 miles long. It has a few small tributaries, the largest of which is called the Nant yr Argae, which in turn starts at St Andrews Major and has a length of 2 miles. The Coldbrook meets the Cadoxton east of Palmerstown, Barry, in some fields in the locality known as Biglis. Another, much smaller stream with a length of about 1 kilometre also drains this area, and converges with the Colbrook just upstream from where it joins the Cadoxton. =Sully Brook= Sully Brook is one of the largest tributaries of the river. Its source is just west of Penarth. It flows southward through the Cosmeston Lakes Country Park. Here it meets a much smaller, unnamed stream, and turns westward. It finally joins with the Cadoxton near Barry docks. Like the Cadoxton, it was also diverted slightly to cool the new chemical plants. Flooding According to the Environment Agency, in the October floods of 1998 only six properties at Dinas Powys were affected. Flooding was caused by the floodwater overtopping the banks of the Cadoxton River among others and ordinary watercourses, restrictions to flow in channels and surcharging of drains.1998 Flooding References Rivers of the Vale of Glamorgan Barry, Vale of Glamorgan ","title":"Cadoxton River"},{"id":"31490319","text":"Petr Vitásek (born 5 August 1981 in Ostrava) is a Czech rower.

It was established in about 1740 by Anyi migrants from Ghana. In 1843 the kingdom became a protectorate of France. In 1959 it was merged with Ivory Coast and at that time the tribal population was estimated to be around 40,000 people in 119 settlements. History The original core of this people is in Ghana where conflicts between Opokou Warreh (Ashanti) and them (Agni) created the reason for a departure to the Ivory Coast. Amalaman Anoh, first king of the Kingdom of Sanwi, lead the Agni in settling in Diby in the Aboisso region. A leadership war then broke out between the Agni and the Agoua, the first occupants of the site. After their victory, the Agni settled in the region of Ciman a valley crowned by hills. So that in time of war, the enemy can not access the new site. But always in search of new lands, Aka Essoin, the henchman of King Amalaman Anoh notable and powerful, responsible for the expansion of the kingdom, hand in conquering new lands more suitable. It is in this quest Aka Essoin discovered a large tree, a cherry: the Krindjabo behind the Bia River. So that to reach the site, it must first cross the Bia, swimming. Knowing safe from possible attacks of the enemy, the Agni people Ciman left the area and settled under the tree or Krindja \\"Krindjabo\\" Agni language. And, thanks to Aka Essoin which has mystical powers to turn into ferocious animal, especially the elephant. Krindjabo, the capital of the kingdom Sanwi is well founded, before the arrival of the white man. Only it is good to know that the great city of Aboisso is the birthplace of the oldest kingdom and most powerful in the history of Côte d'Ivoire: Sanwi. The first mission across the country Agnis involves 2 travel (mission Treich Laplène (1887-1889) which resulted in treaties with Sanwi to Krindjabo (Aboisso) with Bettie and Indénié (Abengourou). in the North, the treaties were signed with the kingdoms of Bondoukou Kong in 1888 and Dabakala with Binger in 1889. Kings and chiefs The kingdom received much attention after declaring American singer Michael Jackson to be the King of the Sanwi in 1992. Reciprocal visits by Michael Jackson and King Amon N'Douffou IV were made to Krindjabo and Los Angeles respectively. After Jackson's death in 2009, an elaborate two-day funeral was held in Sanwi. Jesse Jackson (no relation) was declared prince in August of that year when he was crowned Prince Nana by Amon N'Douffou V, Amon N'Douffou IV's successor as king of Sanwi..

They are located in Middleton, Wisconsin, near Madison, where they manage Holy Wisdom Monastery. Members of the Benedictine Women of Madison participate in communal prayer five times daily. They hold retreats and manage the business affairs of the monastery. History The community grew out of an earlier community of Roman Catholic religious women. In 1954, a group of sisters moved their community from Sioux City, Iowa, to Madison, Wisconsin at the invitation of the Bishop of Madison. The sisters founded and built a Roman Catholic high school for girls in 1958, which they ran until 1966. At that time, the sisters closed the school and reopened their building as an ecumenical prayer center, called St. Benedict Center, to serve the wider Christian community of Madison. In the late 1990s, the community formally withdrew from the jurisdiction of Roman Catholic canon law. They transferred their governance to the Federation of St. Gertrude, a group of 17 independent Benedictine women's communities. The process of transferring governance took over ten years and allowed the Madison women to begin accepting women of any Christian tradition as a member of their community. An ordained Presbyterian minister became the first Protestant member of the community in 2004. She joined two Roman Catholic women. On Sunday mornings, an ecumenical Christian service is held at Holy Wisdom Monastery, which is led by a rotation of ordained Christian ministers, though never a Roman Catholic. Relations with other communions Other groups involved in Holy Wisdom Monastery include the Oblates and the Community of Benedict, two different groups of single and married people from many religious traditions who follow the Rule of St. Benedict in their daily lives; and Sunday Assembly, which gathers on Sunday mornings for an ecumenical Christian worship service. As an ecumenical retreat and conference center, Holy Wisdom Monastery has hosted groups such as the Lutheran Churches' Summer Institute for Mission, monks from the Taizé Community in France, and a visit from the Dalai Lama.Geiger, Matt (11 Jan 2007). \\"Holy Wisdom's break with tradition,\\" Middleton (Wisc.) Times-Tribune In a June 2006 letter to priests in the Diocese of Madison, Bishop Robert Morlino wrote: \\"While this community [the Benedictine Women of Madison] fulfills our call for stronger efforts in ecumenical dialogue, I must stress that this is an experimental community and will not necessarily be Roman Catholic in belief or practice.\\" The move toward ecumenism by the Benedictine Women of Madison was affirmed in 2007 by the worldwide leader of Benedictines, Abbot Primate Notker Wolf, the abbot of San Anselmo Monastery in Rome and official representative of the Benedictine order at the Vatican.

An ancient glacial kettle lake on the property was dredged and 5000 truckloads of silt removed.Lefevere, Patricia (21 February 2003) \\"First U.S. ecumenical community for women,\\" National Catholic Reporter Fields were also restored to native tall grass prairie, using seeds collected from similar prairies in the area.

Facts An hour before the sale by the receiver of Forth Dry Dock to the Forth Estuary company, the receiver sacked all of its twelve employees. The new Forth Estuary company had another set of employees already lined up on lower pay. The receivers had no money left to pay damages for dismissal and holiday pay. TUPER 1981 regulation 5(3) said the Regulations apply to employees who are such ‘immediately before’ the transfer (now, TUPER 2006 regulation 4(3)). The Court of Session held that, following Spence, none of the employees were employed ‘immediately before’ the transfer. The employees appealed. Judgment Lord Templeman held that a purposive approach should be taken, under article 4 of the Business Transfers Directive 77/187/EC. The ‘courts of the United Kingdom are under a duty to follow the practice of the European Court of Justice by giving a purposive construction to Directives and to Regulations issued for the purpose of complying with Directive…’ Lord Oliver agreed that the ECJ cases required a purposive interpretation to be given to the regulations. He noted the remedies provided ‘in the case of an insolvent transferor are largely illusory unless they can be exerted against the transferee’.[1989] IRLR 161, 172 The dismissals are ‘required to be treated as ineffective’, employment is ‘statutorily continued’ The Directive applied both to an employee at the transfer moment and one who ‘would have been so employed if he had not been unfairly dismissed in the circumstances described in regulation 8(1)’ (now regulation 7(1)).

Life Atanasie Rednic was born in February 1722 in Giulești, Maramureș from an influential family. He studied by the Jesuits in Cluj and from 1743 in the Institute Pazmanian in Vienna, where he graduated in theology in 1747. He moved to the monastery in Mukachevo of the Order of Saint Basil the Great and in 1749 he took the monastic vows and was ordained a priest. From 1751 he moved to Blaj, where he cooperated with bishop Petru Pavel Aron in spreading instruction: he founded schools and was appointed the rector of the seminary, and later he became the vicar of the bishop. On 30 June 1764, following the death of the Primate of the Romanian Greek Catholic Church, the bishop of Făgăraş Petru Pavel Aron, the electoral synod convened and Rednic ranked only fourth in the results. Nevertheless, and against the will of the monks, the Habsburg monarch, Empress Maria Theresa, designated him as new bishop. Rednic accepted asking efforts from the government to improve the conditions of the clergy. Pope Clement XIII confirmed the designation on 15 May 1765, and Rednic moved from Vienna to the Carpathian Ruthenia, where he was consecrated bishop on 4 August 1765 by M. Olsavszky, the Eparch of Mukachevo. He later arrived to Blaj, where he was enthroned on 13 November 1765. As bishop, he continued to ask financial support from the government to improve the conditions of the parishes and of the schools, without great results. He also tried to revitalise the monastic life in Blaj introducing a strict discipline which he himself followed. He also continued to support instruction, enlisting the more cultured monks as teachers, and providing aid grants for student to study abroad. Rednic lived an ascetic life. He ate only vegetables and never wore silk clothing.Crăciun, Maria; Fulton, Elaine. (2011). Communities of Devotion: Religious Orders and Society in East Central Europe, 1450-1800. Ashgate. p. 261.

It is the second largest private education business in the UK. The group was acquired by Sovereign Capital in 2002 and sold to DV4 Limited, advised by investment group Delancey in December 2007.RealDeals, 17 December 2007, Sovereign makes fivefold return on Alpha Plus sale The group has been loss making since 2016 and has issued retail bonds that were included in a list of High Risk retail bonds by Investors Chronicle in October 2019 and have traded below par in various occasions since September 2019 reaching a low of £61 in March 2020, a distressed performance that has affected retail bondholders and indicates that the markets have doubts about the group's viability. The chairman of governors is Sir John Ritblat, British Land's former chairman and major Conservative Party donor. History The Group's origins date from the foundation in 1931 of DLD College ‘to provide tuition for the entrance examinations to Oxford and Cambridge universities and to the British Civil Service'. The college has moved campus five times and now occupies a building near Westminster Bridge, where it educates a diverse range of home and international students. Abbey College Manchester was established as a tutorial college in 1990 and now offers GCSE, Foundation and A level courses to local and international students. Abbey College Cambridge was founded in 1994. St Anthony's School for Boys is the oldest school owned by Alpha Plus. Founded in Eastbourne in 1893, it moved to Hampstead in 1952 and was acquired by the Group in 2009. Its sister school, St Anthony's School for Girls opened in September 2016. Wetherby School was founded in 1951, close to the site of the new Wetherby Kensington, and moved to its current premises in 1971; although many boys go on to Wetherby Prep, the pre-prep sends large numbers every year to Westminster Under School and St Paul's Junior School. Wetherby Prep School opened in September 2004 and moved to its current premises (Bryanston Square) in September 2009. In June 2018, the Group signed an agreement to lease additional premises at 47 Bryanston Square.https://www.alphaplusgroup.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/APH- accounts-2018-FINAL-website-version.pdf The Prep School expanded into the new premises in September 2019 creating 7 additional classrooms and a drama suite with stage lighting, proscenium arch and stage set. Wetherby Senior School opened in Marylebone in 2015 and continues the traditions established at Wetherby School and Wetherby Preparatory School. In 2017 Alpha Plus Group acquired the lease to Hannah House, a five-story early 20th century property with 26,000sq feet of space. Hannah House has been devoted to expanding facilities at Wetherby Senior School. In accordance with management's expectations, the senior school will continue to be loss making until at least 2021, when the founding students complete their final year. The Falcons School for Boys, then known as Falkner House Boys, was founded in 1956 and at that time located in Notting Hill. In September 1989 the school transferred to its pre prep site in Burnaby Gardens, Chiswick. The preparatory site opened in Richmond in September 2008. The Falcons School for Girls, located in Putney was acquired in 2001. The Alpha Plus Group accounted for an impairment in the value of two of the Falcons schools by £2.15m in 2019 due to fee reductions and lower than expected pupil numbers. Pembridge Hall was founded in 1979 and acquired in the 1980s. It regularly sends girls to St Paul's Girls' School, other top London schools and leading Girls' boarding schools, including recent scholarship awards to Downe House, Cheltenham Ladies and Wycombe Abbey. Chepstow House School started life in Pembridge Villas in 2010 and subsequently moved to Lancaster Road, Notting Hill, where it will educate boys and girls up to the age of 13. All Alpha Plus preparatory schools send boys and girls on to top English senior schools, often winning entrance scholarships. The Minors Nursery School was founded in 1975 and moved to its current location after joining the Group in 2004. Most of its children progress to either Wetherby or Pembridge Hall, as do the majority of children at Rolfe's Nursery School, Notting Hill. Davenport Lodge Nursery, Coventry, became part of the Alpha Plus Group in May 2007. Portland Place School was founded in the late 1990s by the former Head of Chemistry at St Paul's Girls' School, London. The main school is housed in two adjacent, Grade II listed, James Adam houses (built in c1785); two further buildings were leased in 2002 and 2004. The group accounted for an impairment of £1.6 million of the value of Portland Place School in 2019. The Alpha Plus brand was created in 2002 by Sovereign Capital, from the acquisition of the group of schools and colleges owned by DLD. DV4 Limited, advised by Delancey, acquired the Group from Sovereign Capital in 2007 and expanded the Group through organic growth, opening new schools and acquisitions. Alpha Plus initiated an expansion of its capacity in 2015. It opened four new schools (Wetherby Senior School, St. Anthony's School for Girls, Wetherby-Pembridge New York and Wetherby Kensington School) and posted financial losses as a consequence of the expansion that only added 83 new pupils during the 2016 to 2019 period. With the opening of Wetherby-Pembridge in New York and Wetherby Kensington in London the Group now has 17 schools and 3 colleges.https://www.alphaplusgroup.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/APH- accounts-2019-FINAL-1.pdf The failure to attract Prince George to any of the group's schools despite this having been widely expected by the press was criticised in the US media with one New York media outlet describing the situation of the East Upper End parents who had registered their children for the Wetherby-Pembridge school as \\"royally screwed\\" and Vanity Fair describing how the New York parents were \\"fuming about Prince George's school choice\\".  Fees' Controversy with the Parents during the Coronavirus Lockdown  Alpha Plus was involved in a controversy during the Coronavirus lockdown that was reported by both The Times (\\"William's former school shamed into cutting fees\\") and the Financial Times (\\"For-profit chain caves to parent pressure\\"). The group originally informed the parents in a letter signed the company's CEO, Mr. Hanley-Browne, that fees would still be fully payable and this provoked a backlash from parents, according to the Financial Times, with one parent stating that “It’s the kind of behaviour you’d expect from a distressed hedge fund” and other cancelling the Direct Debit. As a result of the pressure the group reversed course and wrote to parents announcing it would cut summer fees by 20 per cent at its schools. Controversy about the Group's financial situation The Group accumulated approximately £29 million of losses during the 2016-2019 period (£1.4 million in 2016, £7.2 million in 2017, £10.4 million in 2018 and £9.9m million in 2019). Those losses together with the modest increase in pupil numbers (just 83 in four years) have led to a controversy about the Group's financial model as well as about its financial viability and ability to repay its debts that has been reported in the financial press. The Group told the Financial Times that \\"it is a natural sequitur that profits will lag behind any expansion\\" and that it views recent losses as a natural consequence of expansion since it \\"created four schools from scratch in the last four years\\". Nevertheless, the company's annual accounts show that, despite opening four new schools, only 83 pupils had been added by the Group since the beginning of the expansion in 2015 (there were 4,289 pupils in 2015/2016 and 4,372 in 2019/2020). The Group's management reported in the February 2019 accounts that it had \\"seen pupil numbers fall\\" at some schools and that it had \\"responded by reducing fees\\" something that had led to an \\"increase in applications\\". The value of some of the schools had to be written down later in 2019 following the intervention of the auditor EY that had to engage EY Chartered Valuation Specialist and EY Business Valuation specialist (page 17 of the 2019 FY Accounts):  Portland Place School: £1.6m impairment  Falcons School for Boys Pre-Prep: £1.6m impairment  Falcons School for Girls: £0.55m impairment Furthermore, the Group's 2017 and 2018 financial statements had to be restated due to an error in the treatment of the deferred tax liabilities. The Group's equity fell during that same period from £31.4 million in 2015 to £4.6 million in 2019. The Group stated its intention of changing its accounting methods and to adopt the revaluation model following an informal external professional valuation. The Group had a negative working capital of £60 million as at August 2019 and therefore had a significant working capital deficiency. Group revenue in the year ended 31 August 2019 was 6% higher than in the previous year. Reported EBITDA increased to £6.1m (2018:£2.7m). The 2024 retail bonds are now mainly secured against leasehold assets The Financial Times reported in November 2019 about the significant drop in the price of the Group's retail bonds listed in the London Stock Exchange that have been trading below par reaching a low of £61 in March 2020 with a highly distressed 19% yield to maturity indicating a high probability of default. Conflict with the Trade Unions The Group was involved in a conflict with the traded unions in relation to its withdrawal from the Teachers' Pension Scheme (TPS). The National Education Union, that represents several hundred teachers across the independent schools that make up the Group, handed out leaflets outside the Group's schools describing the situation of the teachers following the refusal by the group to either negotiate or meet the union in relation to the Group's plan of exiting the Teachers' Pension Scheme. Glenn Kelly, the union's regional officer dealing with the issue, told the Financial Times that 'It's not my usual day-to-day work—in leafy Notting Hill where children are dropped off by nannies' and added that 'it's a brutal response from an employer that you wouldn't expect in education'\\". In a letter addressed to parents, the Group's CEO, Mark Hanley-Browne, explained that teachers would be expected to sign a variation to their contract terminating their Teachers' Pension Scheme and that if they refused to do so the Group would \\"terminate the current contract of employment of that person, and immediately offer to reengage them on the same terms, except for their pension arrangements.\\" Alpha Plus Group was not alone in trying to respond to the proposed increase in pension contributions. A Freedom of Information request in August 2019 revealed that sixty-two private schools had already notified the government of their intention to withdraw from the Teachers Pension Scheme Further to the pension issues, a loan given by the Group to its British Virgin Islands based parent, DV4 Ltd, was also criticised by the National Education Union that in its leaflets asked parents to \\"Demand Alpha Plus call in the £40m loaned to the parent company\\" but the Group's CEO, Mark Hanley-Browne, said in his letter to parents that \\"it has always been intended that this money be used to finance the Group’s expansion in the form of new schools … it is not available to finance day-to-day operational expenditure which, of course, should be covered by school fees\\". Alpha Plus Group consulted with teaching staff in thirteen of its schools about a proposal to exit from the TPS in August 2019. The consultation closed in April 2019 and the Group withdrew from the TPS in August 2019. All teachers previously enrolled in the TPS re-enrolled in the Group's Personal Pension Plan. No contracts were terminated as a result of the Group's exit from the TPS and there were no strikes despite the unions' encouragement. The strategy was, despite the labour dispute and the press coverage, as explained by the Group in page four of the February 2019 accounts, cost-effective for the Group since it reduced the pension contributions by £1.1m in comparison to the situation if the Group had remained in the TPS: \\"Earlier this year, it was confirmed that employer contributions into the Teachers’ Pension Scheme (“TPS”) would increase from 16.48% to 23.6% of teachers’ salaries with effect from 1 September 2019. This would increase the Group's pension costs by approximately £1.1m per annum.\\" Following the increase in pension employer's pension contributions, a further 107 independent schools withdrew from the Teachers' Pension Scheme.https://ie-today.co.uk/Article/tps-107-independent- schools-quit-after-costs-soar/ Schools *Chepstow House School, Notting Hill, London *Davenport Lodge Nursery School, Coventry, West Midlands *The Falcons School for Boys, Chiswick, London *The Falcons Preparatory School for Boys Richmond, London *The Falcons School for Girls, Putney, London *Hilden Grange School, Tonbridge, Kent *Pembridge Hall School, Notting Hill, London *Portland Place School, Westminster, London *St Anthony's School, Hampstead, London * St. Anthony's School for Girls, Hampstead, London *Wetherby School, Notting Hill, London * Wetherby Kensington, Kensington, London * Wetherby Preparatory School, Marylebone, London * Wetherby Senior School, Marylebone, London *Wetherby-Pembridge School, New York, United States *The Minors Nursery School, Pembridge Square, Notting Hill, London *Rolfe's Nursery School, London Colleges *Abbey DLD Colleges Abbey College, Cambridge Abbey College, Manchester DLD College, London References External links *Alpha Plus Group *https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2019/01/25/1548410430000/A-business-model- fit-to-educate-royalty/ *https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2019/03/28/1553775803000/The-Alpha-Plus-pension- problem-/ *https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2019/06/06/1559821404000/Alpha-Plus-is- still-losing-money/ Education companies of the United Kingdom Private and independent school organisations in England ","title":"Alpha Plus Group"},{"id":"31490602","text":"Graham Smith (born 21 June 1975 in St Albans) is a British rower.

Miles was a right-handed batsman who bowled right-arm off break. He was the elder son of Harold Miles of Odstock, Instow, Devon but was born in Rosario, Santa Fe. He moved to England at some point in his early life, where he was educated at Shrewsbury School, representing the school cricket team. In 1929 he married Miss Ada Margaret Paton, only daughter of Mr. James Paton, J.P., and Mrs. Paton of Newton Cross, Devon. Cricket Miles made his first-class debut for the Army in 1920 against Cambridge University. Years later, in 1926, he toured the country of his birth with the Marylebone Cricket Club, playing four first-class matches against the Argentina national cricket team. A regular feature in the Army side, he played 12 first-class matches for the team up to 1930, with his final first-class match for the Army coming against Oxford University. In 1927, he joined Devon, who he represented in the Minor Counties Championship on 10 occasions to 1933. This paved the way for him to represent the West of England in 1927 against the touring New Zealanders and play for a Minor Counties cricket team against the touring West Indians in 1928. He also represented the Free Foresters and later the Europeans in two fixtures in 1937 against the Cricket Club of India and the Muslims. In total, Miles played 23 first-class matches. In these he scored 613 runs at a batting average of 21.89, scoring two half centuries and a single century which came for the Army against Oxford University in his second first-class match, in which he scored 107 runs before being dismissed by John Bettington. With the ball he took 38 wickets at a bowling average of 31.05, with two five wicket hauls and best figures of 5/74 which came for the Army against the touring New Zealanders when they toured in 1927. Military career Miles served in the British Army and in 1920 was serving in the King's Shropshire Light Infantry as a second lieutenant. He was mentioned in the London Gazette in 1920 as having been promoted to the rank of lieutenant. Twelve years later he was seconded from King's Shropshire Light Infantry to act as an officer of a company of gentlemen cadets. In 1936 he held the rank of captain, but had relinquished his position as an instructor on 27 August 1936. Later serving in the Second World War, he had by 1944 reached the rank of major. In that same year he was mentioned in dispatches in a supplement to the London Gazette which detailed his promotion to lieutenant colonel. Following the war, Miles was placed on a disability list in September 1946. The nature of his disability is not known. By November 1947 his disability had taken its toll on Miles, and he retired from active service with the rank of lieutenant colonel. A decade later he died in Newton Tracey, Devon on 21 July 1957.

Aberbach (8 February 1909 – 17 May 2004)Profile at Geni was an Austrian-born music publisher, who lived and worked in both the United States and France. He was responsible, with his younger brother Jean Aberbach, for establishing the Hill and Range music publishing house, and was instrumental in the careers of many leading country and popular music performers of the mid and late twentieth century, including Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, Ray Charles, Edith Piaf and Jacques Brel. Life and career Aberbach was born in Vienna, the son of Anna and Aron Adolf Aberbach, who were Ukrainian Jews. His father ran a jewelry business. Julian left school at the age of 17 and went to the Tyrol with his brother, selling upholstery, before returning to Vienna. His brother Jean then began working in Berlin for a music publisher, Will Meisel, before moving to Paris to work for another publisher there. Julian joined him in Paris in 1932, and soon established his own publishing business, which concentrated on securing royalties for movie screenwriters. After the brothers sold the business in 1936, Jean began working in the US as an agent for French music publisher Francis Salabert, while Julian remained in Paris.American Society of the French Legion of Honor, Newsletter, December 2003 In 1939 he secured an exit visa to travel to New York City. He was drafted in 1941, and after working with Free French troops in Fort Benning, Georgia, became an instructor at a military intelligence school in Maryland, from where he was discharged in 1944.Biography by Jason Ankeny at AllmusicAutobiography at Julian Aberbach website By this time he had developed an interest in country music, which he saw as a potentially profitable component of American popular music.Biography After leaving the Army he set up a publishing business, Hill and Range, in Los Angeles with business partners Milton Blink and Gerald King.John Shepherd, Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World, Volume 1, p.586 There, he heard the Western swing bandleader Spade Cooley who was performing at the Venice Pier. He signed Cooley to a songwriting contract, and had immediate success with Cooley's hit song \\"Shame on You\\". Soon afterwards, he began working with Bob Wills, setting up a publishing company in Wills' name in which Aberbach had a 50% share. He developed contacts in the music industry in Nashville, and organised the songwriting agreements for such stars as Red Foley, Ernest Tubb, Eddy Arnold, Hank Snow, and, later, Johnny Cash. At one point, about three quarters of all the music produced in Nashville was represented by Hill and Range. When Max Dreyfus of rival publishers Chappell Music sought to buy the company, Aberbach refused, and his brother Jean, who had been working for Dreyfus, joined the company. From then on the two brothers shared the management of Hill and Range, gradually expanding the business, with Julian notionally based in Los Angeles and Jean in New York, although the two frequently swapped roles and met regularly in Chicago to discuss business. In 1955 Hank Snow suggested that Aberbach check out a new singer, Elvis Presley. Aberbach was impressed by Presley, helped his own friend, Colonel Tom Parker, become his manager, and helped negotiate his move from Sun Records to RCA. He also set up an unprecedented arrangement in which the publishing rights to songs that Presley recorded were split 50:50 between Hill and Range and Presley. Aberbach established his cousin, Freddy Bienstock, as head of Elvis Presley Music, and organised writers to provide songs for Presley's films and albums. In effect, this precluded Presley from recording material not licensed to Hill and Range. Aberbach also developed his interests in France, contracting Johnny Hallyday to cover songs recorded by Presley. He also worked closely with Edith Piaf, and with Jacques Brel and Mort Shuman, who provided English language versions of many of Brel's songs. By the early 1970s, after Hill and Range had become the biggest independent music publishing business in the world, Aberbach and his family moved their main residence to Paris. Shortly afterwards, while on a business trip to New York, Aberbach suffered a major heart attack and was hospitalised for several months. His brother then sold 75% of the Hill and Range publishing rights to the Warner Chappell company. He effectively retired from the music business in the early 1970s, but expanded his collection of paintings and sculpture, and later opened the Aberbach Gallery in New York. He received the Abe Olman Award for music publishers at the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2000, and received the National Order of the Legion of Honour in 2003, in recognition of his unique contribution to French culture. Personal life and death Aberbach married Anne Marie in 1953. They had two sons, Dolfi who died aged 23 in 1983 and Ronny who died in an accident the same year, and a daughter, Belinda. His brother Jean Aberbach died in 1992.Death notice, New York Times, 19 May 2004 Julian Aberbach died of heart failure in New York in 2004 at the age of 95.

Members of the unit included foreign volunteers such as Germans, the British, the French, Swedes, Paraguayans and Argentines. As part of the Croatian Defence Council (\\"Convicts' Battalion\\"), he fought against Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) and Army of Republika Srpska (VRS). He was his unit's commander, under general Ivan Andabak.\\"Tuta je domoljub, a ne mafijaš i kriminalac\\", bhdani.com; accessed 14 April 2015. He was a close friend of then-Croatian Minister of Defence Gojko Šušak. On 2 August 1992, Naletilić ordered his unit to assassinate Blaž Kraljević, general of the Croatian Defence Forces and general of the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH), along with eight of Kraljević's staff. Naletilić rewarded twenty of the men in the unit with 5,000 Deutschmarks each. Tuta je naredio: Poljubite Kraljevića, hsp1861.hr; accessed 14 April 2015.

In 1967, following Ukrpryroda's advocacy arguments, the Ukrainian Government founded the State Nature Protection Committee that had a status of a central government agency. This took place three years before Nixon established the EPA in the US, six years before the European Commission created an Environmental and Consumer Protection Directorate and 21 years before Gorbachev established a similar Soviet-wide agency in Moscow.See the years of establishment of the State Committees for Environmental Protection of the USSR and the Russian SFSR. The State Nature Protection Committee was upgraded to the ministerial status in 1991. Ukrpryroda promotes public awareness of recycling, environmental education and the love for nature at schools, in local communities and among local authorities. It has branches in all the regions and most of the regional districts/municipalities as well as in the special-status cities of Kiev and Sevastopol.  History  Ukraine Nature Conservation Society (Ukrpryroda) was founded on June 28, 1946 during an environmental disaster - a drought that triggered a famine. It has a fascinating history of struggle of the founders of the Ukrainian environmental movement. Nikita Khrushchev (then the Head of the Government of the Ukrainian SSR and the Communist Party) gave permission for establishment of Ukrpryroda in response to numerous appeals of Ukrainian scientists and conservationists, many of whom were academics. Up until the mid-1960s, Ukrpryroda was the only voice for environment in draft public policy decisions, working closely with the Planning Commission and other government bodies. At that time Ukrpryroda requested the introduction of a comprehensive ecological-economic approach to the planned economy and promoted the establishment of the Ministry of Environment within the Ukrainian Government. It was not easy to assert environmental rights in the absence of democracy even by Ukraine's famous scientists. However, giving in to the pressure of Ukrpryroda, the Government created the State Nature Protection Committee as a central government agency in 1967. To compare, the US Environmental Protection Agency was established three years later, and the State Environmental Protection Committees of both the USSR and the Russian SFSR were established only 21 years later. Professor Mykhailo Voinstvenskiy was the Chairperson of Ukrpryroda in 1963–1982. In 1971, Professor Stepan Stoyko, the head of Ukrpryroda's Lviv branch, hired Viacheslav Chornovil who had been previously imprisoned for political beliefs.See Marine Elbakidze. Professor Stoyko's rule of eight. (in Ukrainian) 'The Vysokiy Zamok' newspaper of May 14, 2010. During the era of stagnation and the subsequent perestroika, Ukrpryroda focused on environmental education, particularly among high school/university students and senior citizens, mobilizing them to participate in community service days. Ukrpryroda's and other public voices on environmental issues were heard at the time when the State Nature Protection Committee was led by Dina Protsenko, the first woman in the world to be an environmental minister (in the office during 1978–1988). Only with Ukraine's independence, the status of the State Nature Protection Committee was elevated to the Ministry of Environment in 1991. In December 1992, the Ministry of Justice re-registered Ukrpryroda's charter amended by its 9th Congress on November 21, 1991. In Ukrpryroda governance, the Congress establishes a Pan-Ukrainian Council and its Board that consist, in majority, of volunteers. One of the new goals became to leverage the civil society, exercising the legislative right for the public and NGOs to receive information on environmental disclosure, to be consulted and even to participate in pollution inspections and raids against poachers under certain circumstances.  Structure  Ukrpryroda is a nonprofit organization. Its highest governing body is the Congress that is elected by Ukrpryroda volunteers every 5 years. Between Congress meetings, Ukrpryroda is governed by the Pan-Ukrainian Council and its Board chaired by the President. 23 regional (incl. Kiev and Sevastopol) organizations of Ukrpryroda report to the Pan- Ukrainian Council. These regional organizations have 354 district and 70 local branches, which include 23,000 primary organizations (at schools and universities, etc.), more than 10,000 corporate members (sponsors, co-hosts of environmental events and community days) and over 2 million individual members / volunteers. Vasyl Shevchuk, a former Environment Minister, has been the Chairperson of the Board of Ukrpryroda's Pan-Ukrainian Council since 2002.  Activities  = Participation in the dialogue with the government and politicians = Ukrpryroda stands for and promotes public and parliamentary control over the clean environment.

Principles of corporate social responsibility (CSR).Global Reporting Initiative - Sustainability Reporting Guidelines = Sections of UUkrpryroda = Ukrpryroda's organizational system includes 10 national and 140 regional thematic sections. Their issue can be divided into mobilization of scientific research, advocacy and public policy. Among substantive issues for research are environmental safety, protection and restoration of flora and fauna, minerals, water resources, atmosphere, land, fish stocks, forests and protected areas. Advocacy is taken on via the promotion and development of environmental youth movement as well as the promotion of legal rights, spreading environmental awareness among school and university students, population of regions. Sectional work on public policy includes legislative recommendations on protection and rational use of natural resources and implementing methodologies (through its scholarly members) to assist regional and local branches of Ukrpryroda. = Environmental activities in the regions = Members of Ukrpryroda take an active part in such international and national environmental actions, as World Environment Day,Celebrated on June 5, the opening date of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment (Stockholm, 1972) which founded UNEP Earth Day, World Wetlands Day,Celebrated on February 2, the signing date of the Ramsar Convention (Iran, 1971) “Clean Ukraine - Clean Earth” and such regional environmental actions as “A Primrose”, “A Spring”, “A Fir Tree”, “Clean Air”, “A Tomtit”, “A Swamp Turtle”, “A Spawning” and other ones. It is important for Ukrpryroda to attract people to participation in environmental protection, performing a variety of regional and local environmental actions such as afforestation, planting trees in the urban areas, greening public places, cleaning river banks and lakes, liquidation of dumps, etc. Ukrpryroda's regional organizations initiate community service days where communities clean their territories. = Educational activities = Every year the Pan-Ukrainian Council together with the regional organizations of Ukrpryroda conducts targeted educational and public-awareness campaigns by organizing public lectures, weekend excursions, public movie/documentary watching, thematic exhibitions, open roundtables and seminars. Also, Ukrpryroda reaches out through publications, particularly the nationwide popular-science magazine 'The Native Nature', 'The Shamrock' newspaper, many brochures, and sections in the local newspapers help regular appearances in the media.

Life and career Aberbach was born in Bad Vöslau, Austria, the son of Anna and Aron Adolf Aberbach, who were Ukrainian Jews. His father ran a jewelry business. Jean left school at the age of 16 and after a family argument began working in Berlin for a music publisher, Will Meisel, before moving to Paris to work for another publisher there. His brother Julian joined him in Paris in 1932, and they established a music publishing business, which concentrated on securing royalties for movie screenwriters.

The legislation was introduced in the 114th United States Congress in March, 2015. Similar legislation was introduced in the 110th and 111th United States Congress but was not passed into law. Background At least 1 in 3 women around the world are subject to sexual, physical or other abuse during their life, per estimates by the United Nations Development Fund for Women. Not only does violence against women prevent mothers from raising healthy children, it also affects the economic progress and stability within the country in which they live.The International Violence Against Women Act (I-VAWA) (S.2982, HR. 4594). Amnesty International Issue Brief No. 2. March 2010. Retrieved November 23, 2011. International Violence Against Women Act of 2015 The International Violence Against Women Act of 2015 (I-VAWA) (, ) was introduced to ensure that addressing violence against women is included in the nation's foreign policy, with best practices for preventing violence, protecting victims and prosecuting offenders. The legislation was the result of efforts by: * Amnesty International USA * Family Violence Prevention Fund * Women Thrive Worldwide. Experts in related fields from 40 international and 150 U.S. groups provided input for the legislation. The House of Representatives Bill (HR. 1340) was brought before the 114th Congress, sponsored by Representative Janice Schakowsky, Illinois's 9th congressional district. The Senate Bill (S.713), was introduced by Senator Barbara Boxer of California. Criticism I-VAWA has been criticized on the grounds that it would discriminate against male victims and impose Western values upon other societies. According to Wendy McElroy, a research fellow at The Independent Institute, the Act \\"constitutes a 5-year redirection of foreign aid funds in order to insert politically-correct feminism into the structure of other nations\\" and \\"revictimizes every male victim by denying his existence.\\" Organizations Many organizations support the I-VAWA Act, some of which are: * Amnesty International USA * American Jewish World Service * Human Rights Watch * International Center for Research on Women * International Rescue Committee * Refugees International * Vital Voices * Women's Refugee CommissionInternational Violence Against Women Act Organizational Supporters.

It cost R3.50 and produced in 24–32 full-colour pages in broadsheet format. It was printed in three separate locations.

Circulation and readership A stand of free-to-read New Age newspapers at Cape Town International Airport. The Gupta owned newspaper was controversially awarded the contract to supply free-to-read newspapers to airports at government expense. The New Age did not publish circulation figures, and its publication figures were not audited by the Audit Bureau of Circulations of South Africa, as most other South African newspapers are. The newspaper's website claimed a daily print run of over 100,000 copies,\\"Advertise with us\\", The New Age although there were accusations that up to 50,000 copies were returned to be pulped daily.Sarah Evans, Lionel Faull, \\"New Age: Dawn of advertising riches with no circulation figures\\", Mail & Guardian, 25 January 2013. Some 50,000 copies were sold on bulk subscription to South African parastatals. According to the South African Audience Research Foundation's official All Media Products Survey (AMPS), The New Age had a readership of about 39,000 in January–December 2011, about 87,000 in July–June 2011/2012,\\"Average Issue Readership of Newspapers and Magazines\\", Jul '11-Jun '12. and about 107 000 in January–December 2012.\\"Average Issue Readership of Newspapers and Magazines\\", Jan-Dec '12. Impartiality controversy The Gupta family owned TNA Media, which owned The New Age.TNA Media There was much controversy about the closeness of members of the Gupta family to the former President of South Africa, Jacob Zuma, and over perceived resultant lack of impartiality in the paper's reporting on the president and the ruling ANC Party.Hlongwane, Sipho (27 September 2010). \\"As The New Age enters the world, Atul Gupta enters new controversy\\". Daily Maverick. In October 2012 the editorial cartoonist, Jeremy Nell (AKA JERM), was fired by the editor for cartoons that contained \\"political judgements or statements\\". Nell's cartoons frequently criticised the ANC and President Zuma.Gardner, Alan (19 October 2012). \\"Jeremy Nell fired from New Age because of 'political judgements or statements'\\". The Daily Cartoonist. In January 2013 it became known that public corporations (such as Transnet (transport), Telkom (telecoms) and Eskom (electricity)) had funded \\"New Age Business Breakfasts\\" – platforms for prominent individuals – for millions of Rands. In addition, the national broadcaster (SABC) broadcast the events at no cost. The opposition leader Helen Zille subsequently withdrew from a scheduled briefing at one of these breakfasts, which The New Age reported on, casting her in an unfavourable light. Complaints to the Press Ombudsman by the Democratic Alliance opposition party resulted in a front-page apology to Zille and the Democratic Alliance on 31 May 2013 \\"for not asking them for comment on several important issues contained in two stories that we published earlier this year, and for headlines in one story that unjustifiably made her out to be a liar and a hypocrite\\". In March 2016 The New Age, along with the Gupta owned ANN7, was strongly criticised by the African National Congress (ANC) for its coverage of President Jacob Zuma's relationship with the Gupta family and the ensuing political controversy around the issue. The newspaper apologised for its coverage shortly after the ANC's criticism was stated. The international news broadcaster Al Jazeera English alleged that Zuma's close relationship with the Guptas \\"translated into friendly coverage in the outlets they own,\\" specifically the twenty-four hour news channel ANN7 and The New Age. During the run-up to President Jacob Zuma's March 2017 firing of Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan - who had previously actively resisted the pro-Zuma Gupta family's continued and repeated attempts at state capture of the treasury, Eskom and other State-owned Enterprises - ANN7 ran repeated and aggressive propaganda campaigns to discredit the minister, often using incomplete or fabricated evidence. The channel was fiercely criticised for spreading biased and fake news in a bid to undermine the Finance Minister, and paint the President in a more favourable light.

He gained an interest in calligraphy as a child, and left the tribe for further training.

Kalhor modified and adapted Nastaʿlīq to be easily used with printing machines and newspaper lithography, which in turn helped wide dissemination of his transcripts. He also devised methods for teaching Nastaʿlīq and specified clear proportional rules for it, which many could follow.

Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 462 U.S. 87 (1983), is a United States Supreme Court decision that held valid a Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) rule that during the licensing of nuclear power plants, the permanent storage of nuclear waste should be assumed to have no environmental impact.. Background 42 U.S.C. § 4332(c) of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). requires government agencies to consider the environmental impact of any major federal action. For the licensing of nuclear power plants by the NRC, the environmental impact includes activities necessary to produce new nuclear fuel and to dispose of spent nuclear fuel. In 1974, the NRC adopted a rule to determine the environmental impact of the fuel cycle in plant licensing proceedings. For the long-term storage of transuranic and high-level radioactive waste, the rule in Table S-3 assumed that there would be no environmental impact because of a \\"zero release\\" assumption. That assumption was based upon an expectation that technology would be developed to isolate the wastes from the environment. The Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) filed an action to challenge the Table S-3 rule, leading to the Supreme Court case Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 435 U.S. 519 (1978).. Then, the Supreme Court reversed the ruling by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit that the NRC rulemaking procedures to develop the rule were inadequate. It stated that the NRC had done everything that was required by NEPA and the Administrative Procedures Act and that courts lack the authority to impose rulemaking procedures greater than those contemplated by these statutes. The case was remanded for the circuit court to determine whether the Table S-3 rule was adequately supported by the administrative record. While the Vermont Yankee case was before the Supreme Court, the NRC proposed a new Table S-3 rule, which maintained the \\"zero release\\" assumption for the long-term storage of spent fuel. The NRC also rejected a petition filed by the NRDC that had requested for Table S-3 to include uncertainties or for the nuclear plant licensing proceedings to be allowed to consider uncertainties in emissions from spent fuel storage. The NRDC and New York State petitioned for judicial review of the Table S-3 rule in circuit court. The circuit court ruled that \\"Table S-3 rules were arbitrary and capricious and inconsistent with NEPA because the Commission had not factored the consideration of uncertainties surrounding the zero-release assumption into the licensing process in such a manner that the uncertainties could potentially effect the outcome of any decision to license a particular plant.\\" The Supreme Court, on appeal, granted certiorari. Decision The Supreme Court reversed the decision of the circuit court and ruled that the NRC had complied with the requirements of NEPA. It explained that the NEPA requires that an agency must consider every significant aspect of the environmental impact of a proposed action and for the public to be informed of this. The role of a court is to ensure that the agency adequately considered and disclosed the environmental impact of its decision and that the agency's decision was not arbitrary and capricious. Regarding the Table S-3 rule, it was the result of a lengthy proceeding in which the NRC determined that it was appropriate to evaluate the general environmental effects of the storage of nuclear wastes and not to evaluate the effects during nuclear power plant licensing proceedings. It devices that the NRC's choice to use that generic method in the Table S-3 regulation was valid that and courts do not have the authority to require a different rule, under the APA.

Personal life  Photo taken in the staff room at UNSW in the 70’s whilst Kollar was talking with Paul Walsh, one of Kollar’s ‘acolytes’ and a very close friend Born in Budapest, Hungary, in 1926, Peter Kollar completed his secondary schooling in Hungary in 1944. The following year he enrolled in the architecture program at the Technical University of Budapest and studied there for the next four years. In 1949, eight months before completing his degree, Kollar fled Hungary after the communist takeover of his country. He then spent some time in Italy working for the International Refugee Organization, while also travelling to Austria and Germany. He sailed to Australia in September 1950, initially staying at Bonegilla, a migrant reception centre in Victoria, before moving to Villawood migrant reception centre in Sydney in late October 1950. Kollar’s first job in Sydney was as a labourer with the British Australian Lead Manufacturers, but in February 1951 he obtained a position of more personal interest to him — that of architectural draftsman. Peter Kollar was studying an Associate Diploma (Architecture) part-time when the course was transferred from Sydney Technical College to the New South Wales University of Technology in 1951, thus beginning what was to become a long-term association with this university. He graduated in 1953 and four years later, in June 1957, Kollar accepted an appointment as a lecturer in Architecture. His ‘Principles of Design’ lectures were said to have had a profound subject matter which focused on the nature of the human condition informed by a deep understanding of great Spiritual Traditions of the world. Over the years Kollar developed a suite of courses that complemented and elaborated on these principles. He remained a member of the university’s academic community until his death. In that time he served the university as lecturer, senior lecturer, associate professor and, finally, visiting professor. He was buried at Macquarie Park Cemetery and Crematorium, Sydney in December 2000. Design principles Kollar asserts the primacy of intellect over circumstances; the root of beautiful architecture is in not in material reality but in enlightenment philosophy. Much of Kollar’s written work is concerned with the duality of Function and Beauty; he argues that there is, hypothetically, an equation wherein Function equals Truth and Truth equals Beauty. He references architectural history only in the spiritual context: Central to Kollar’s philosophy is the notion that architecture has a responsibility to facilitate human delight and spiritual awareness. In his Patterns of Delightful Architecture Kollar asserts that this universal delight is only achievable through harmony, lucidity, analogy, ordered geometry and rhythm, a carefully considered relationship between the whole and its many parts, and sensitivity to the various phases or events in the human condition.

They placed fourth in the competition which resulted in the winning design by Jørn Utzon. Kollar’s design was ranked the highest out of all Australian entries and was met with high appraisal by judges for its ‘skilful planning’. However, Kollar continually championed Utzon’s design, even when Utzon omitted himself from the project, recognizing that the Sydney Opera House Utzon had designed was seen as important in a newly liberated design language. The Opera House design Kollar created are some of the highlights in Kollar’s papers, which were deposited at UNSW Archives.

However, a Pew Research Center survey of its Somali-majority northwestern neighbour Djibouti reported a creed breakdown of Muslims which was reported as 77% adhering to Sunnism, 8% as non-denominational Muslim, 2% as Shia, thirteen percent refusing to answer, and a further report inclusive of Somali Region stipulating 2% adherence to a minority sect (e.g. Ibadism, Quranism etc.).Filesi, Teobaldo. \\"MOGADISCIO: TANTI SECOLI FA.\\" Africa: Rivista trimestrale di studi e documentazione dell’Istituto italiano per l’Africa e l’Oriente 51.2 (1996): 263-272. Sufism, the mystical dimension of Islam, is also well-established, with many local jama'a (zawiya) or congregations of the various tariiqa or Sufi orders.I. M. Lewis, Saints and Somalis: popular Islam in a clan-based society, (The Red Sea Press: 1998), pp. 8–9. Article 3 of the Provisional Constitution of Somalia defines Islam as the state religion of the Federal Republic of Somalia, and Islamic sharia as the basic source for national legislation. It also stipulates that no law that is inconsistent with the basic tenets of Shari'a can be enacted. Article 11 guarantees equal rights and freedom from persecution for all citizens before the law regardless of religion. Additionally, Article 17 protects freedom of religion. History =Bronze age= As the Horn was located to the east of sun-worshipping Egypt, the Horn being associated with the sunrise was then referred to as God's land during the Puntite period, arguably referring to deity's such as Ra. For much of the 1st millennium BC and 1st millennium AD, a predominant religion practised by proto-Somalis as well as other Cushites and Horners was Waaqism, although in the post-classical period, various Abrahamic faiths became increasingly prevalent.Ta’a, Tesema. \\"Religious beliefs among the Oromo: Waaqeffannaa, Christianity and Islam in the context of ethnic identity, citizenship and integration.\\" Ethiopian Journal of the Social Sciences and Humanities 8.1 (2012): 87-111.Kirwan, Laurence Patrick. \\"The Christian topography and the Kingdom of Axum.\\" Geographical Journal (1972): 166-177. =Classical era= The native standard derivation suffixes to signify adherence to the Waaqist religion would produce Waaqnimo as the uncountable noun, and waaqyahan as the agent noun.Cohen, David, Marie-Claude Simeone-Senelle, and Martine Vanhove. \\"The grammaticalization of ‘say’and ‘do’: An areal phenomenon in East Africa.\\" Reported discourse: A meeting ground for different linguistic domains. Benjamins: Amsterdam/Philadelphia, 2002. Sources differ on whether Waaqism was henotheistic or monotheistic.Said, M., and Shidad Hussein. \\"1) Previously-noted Archeo-cultural Connections.\\" (2015). Many of the exact ancient practices of waaqism are to some extent speculative, however analysts have used various methods to envisage or conceptualize the ancient inferences of the religion, including explicating from the analogous Oromo concept of Waaqeffannaa which has in many ways overlaps with Waaqism. Other methods include explicating from remnant spiritual practises which are sometimes inferred to in precolonial Somali poetry dating to around the turn of the 19th century, or through the usage of retrospection via its appearance in several Somali proper nouns, such as in the title of clan names such as Jidwaaq (meaning path of Waaq), or in place names such as Caabudwaaq (meaning worship Waaq). Contemporary Somali views on the ancient religion vary from aversiveness, to a perception that its monotheistic aspects ameliorated conversions to Abrahamic religions over the course of the 1st and 2nd millennium, to an intuition that some Waaqist practises linger within Somali culture in the form of syncretism.Aram, Ben I. \\"Somalia's Judeao-Christian heritage: a preliminary survey.\\" Africa Journal of Evangelical Theology 22.2 (2003): 3-28. There was a marked and pronounced difference in prehistoric forms of worship among Low-land Cushitic Horners, and that of the ancient proto-Somali Waaqists. Whereas pre-historic archeological finds such as that at Laas Geel are suggestive of panentheistic polytheism and naturalistic pantheism which included the worship of cattle, the subsequent literate period during the antiquity and the classical era wherein Waaqism became a predominant religion among the indigenous proto- Somalis appear to leave no traces of such forms of worship. As it is widely acknowledged that Abrahamic religions had reached the Horn of Africa concurrently with other parts of the world, this could suggest that Abrahamic tenets such as monotheism, non-tangible divinity, an ultimate destiny and omniscience may have influenced adaptations or configurations within Waaqism.Said, M., and Shidad Hussein, Previously-noted Archeo-cultural Connections. (2015).Rodríguez, Jorge de Torres. \\"Against All Odds: The History of Archaeological Research in Somaliland and Somalia.\\" Northeast African Studies 18.1-2 (2018): 271-310. Elements of Somali culture, which have been suspected of being a ligature or remnant of ancient Waaqism and overtly observed surviving into the 19th century include reverence-related aspects of qabiilism (associated with ancestor veneration), or in the South West state, former incorporations into dabshid, which used to include several practises associated with fire. However, some Somali clans more observant of mystical rites such as Madhiban are covert and secretive about their ancient Somali culture.Behr, Agnes Wanjiru. \\"IDENTITY AND BODY BORDERS: THE PERCEPTION OF THE KENYA SOMALIA BORDER.\\" American Journal of International Relations 3.1 (2018): 1-10. SOme of the religious practises dating back to the Waaq or classical era survive into the present, including mingis, a pre-islamic demon-cleansing ritual. However, mingis-practitioners in Somalia do face security risks. In July 2020, five people were killed in the country allegedly due to their practise of mingis.https://hiiraan.com/news4/2020/July/179159/scores_killed_in_mass_shooting_in_mogadishu.aspx?utm_source=hiiraan&utm;_medium=SomaliNewsUpdateFront =Medieval era= Islam entered the region very early on, shortly after the hijra. The two-mihrab Masjid al-Qiblatayn dates to the 7th century, and is the oldest mosque in the country, in the city of Zeila, which Ibn Battuta described as a Shiite city in the 14th century, and remained as such until Ottoman expansionism attempted to incorporate Horner and/or Cushite Sultans along the Horn African coast in the late 16th century.Nour, Tanq Mohamed. \\"Ottoman Efforts to Protect Somalia from European Powers.\\" Proceedings of the International Symposium on Islamic Civilisation in Eastern Africa: Kampala, Uganda, 15–17 December 2003. No. 13. Research Centre for Islamic History, Art and Culture, 2006. In the late 9th century, Al-Yaqubi wrote that Muslims were living along the northern Somali seaboard. He also mentioned that the Adal kingdom had its capital in the city, suggesting that the Adal Sultanate with Zeila as its headquarters dates back to at least the 9th or 10th century. According to I.M. Lewis, the polity was governed by local dynasties, who also ruled over the similarly-established Sultanate of Mogadishu in the Benadir region to the south. Merca is an ancient Islamic center in Somalia. There are two theories about when Somalis began adopting Islam. One states that Islam probably arrived in Somalia in the 7th-century when followers of Muhammad came over to escape persecution from the Quraysh tribe in Mecca. An alternate theory states that Islam was brought to the coastal settlements of Somalia between the 7th and the 10th century by seafaring Arab and Persian merchants. The Sunni-Shia split within Islam occurred before Islam spread among Somalis, and Sunnis constitute the overwhelming majority of contemporary Somalis. Somali Sufi religious orders (tariqa) – the Qadiriyya, the Ahmadiya and the Salihiyya – in the form of Muslim brotherhoods have played a major role in Somali Islam and the modern era history of Somalia. Of the three orders, the less strict Qaadiriya tariqa is the oldest, and it is the sect to which most Somalis belonged. The Qaadiriya order is named after Shaikh Muhiuddin Abdul Qadir Gilani of Baghdad. I. M. Lewis states that Qaadiriya has a high reputation for maintaining a higher standard of Islamic instruction than its rivals. Ahmadiyah and its sub-sect Salihiyyah preached a puritanical form of Islam, and have rejected the popular Sufi practice of tawassul (visiting the tombs of saints to ask mediation). B. G. Martin states that these two orders shared some of the views of the Wahhabis of Arabia. The religious differences between Qaadiriya and Salihiyya were controversial, as Salihis continued to oppose the Qadiris' practice of tawassul, and claimed the act to be invalid and improper religious activity. The Ahmadiya has the smallest number of adherents of the three orders. Qur'anic schools (also known as dugsi) remain the basic system of traditional religious instruction in Somalia. It is delivered in Arabic. They provide Islamic education for children. According to the UNICEF, the dugsi system where the content is based on the Quran, teaches the greatest number of students and enjoys high parental support, is oftentimes the only system accessible to Somalis in nomadic as compared to urban areas.pages The Integrated Quranic Schools Pilot Project: The Strategic Partnership for Recovery and Development of Education in Somalia, United Nations Children Funds, UNICEF Somalia Support Centre (2011), 6-10 A study from 1993 found, among other things, that \\"unlike in primary schools where gender disparity is enormous, around 40 per cent of Qur'anic school pupils are girls; but the teaching staff have minimum or no qualification necessary to ensure intellectual development of children.\\" To address these concerns, the Somali government on its own part subsequently established the Ministry of Endowment and Islamic Affairs, under which Qur'anic education is now regulated. Somali community has produced important Muslim figures over the centuries, many of whom have significantly shaped the course of Islamic learning and practice in the Horn of Africa and the Muslim world. Minorities The Mogadishu Cathedral, the former seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Mogadiscio. =Christianity= Christianity is a minority religion in Somalia, with no more than 1,000 practitioners (about 0.01% of the population). According to estimates of the Diocese of Mogadishu (the territory of which coincides with the country) there were only about 100 Catholic practitioners in Somalia in 2004. In 1913, during the early part of the colonial era, there were virtually no Christians in the Somali territories, with only about 100–200 followers coming from the schools and orphanages of the few Catholic missions in the British Somaliland protectorate.Charles George Herbermann, The Catholic encyclopedia: an international work of reference on the constitution, doctrine, discipline, and history of the Catholic church, Volume 14, (Robert Appleton company: 1913), p. 139. There were also no known Catholic missions in Italian Somaliland during the same period.Charles Henry Robinson, History of Christian Missions, (READ BOOKS: 2007), p. 356. In the 1970s, during the reign of Somalia's then Marxist government, church-run schools were closed and missionaries sent home. There has been no archbishop in the country since 1989, and the cathedral in Mogadishu was severely damaged during the civil war. =Traditional Faith= According to the Pew Research Center, less than 0.01% of Somalia's population in 2010 were adherents of traditional or folk religions. These mainly consisted of some non-Somali ethnic minority groups in the southern parts of the country, who practice animism. In the case of the Bantu, these religious traditions were inherited from their ancestors in Southeast Africa, and include the practice of possession dances and the use of magic and curses. Waaqism was an ancient traditional religion practised by many Horners, in particular by Cushites. As there has not been a comprehensive survey, it is unclear to what extent Somali Waaqists exist in the contemporary period.Mire, Sada. \\"Wagar, fertility and phallic stelae: Cushitic sky-god belief and the site of Saint Aw-Barkhadle, Somaliland.\\" African Archaeological Review 32.1 (2015): 93-109. =Other= According to the Pew Research Center, less than 0.01% of Somalia's population in 2010 were adherents of Hinduism, Buddhism, or unaffiliated with any religion. One correspondent has discussed how irreligiosity is an increasing phenomenon among Somalis. Although the bulk of this sentiment comes from Somalis in the diaspora, there are also many Somalis from their home country, Somalia, who discuss their disbelief in religion, although covertly. These discussions primarily revolve around the existence of God. It has been theorized that increased apostasy, irreligiosity and detachment from religion stems from misgivings and despair at the existence of radical Salafist groups such as Daa'ish and Shabab.https://www.somaliaffairs.com/features/islam-modernity-and-somali- youths/Elfversson, Emma. \\"The political conditions for local peacemaking: A comparative study of communal conflict resolution in Kenya.\\" Comparative Political Studies 52.13-14 (2019): 2061-2096.  Freedom of religion  The provisional constitution of Somalia provides for the right of individuals to practice their religion, makes Islam the state religion, prohibits the propagation of any religion other than Islam (although it does not explicitly ban conversion), and stipulates all laws must comply with the general principles of Muslim religious law. No exemptions from application of sharia legal principles exist for non-Muslims. The federal government of Somalia had limited ability to implement its laws beyond greater Mogadishu; most other areas of Somalia were outside its control.International Religious Freedom Report 2017 Somalia, US Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. The provisional constitution requires the president, but not other office holders, to be Muslim. There are no public places of worship for non-Muslims in the country. Due to the Somali Civil War, the enforcement of laws pertaining to religion by the various autonomous governments in the region is inconsistent. Generally, the judiciary in most areas relies on xeer (traditional and customary law), sharia, and the penal code. In many regions, activity by Salafi groups further restricts religious freedom, as individuals are afraid of reprisal. = Societal attitudes = There is a strong societal pressure to adhere to Sunni traditions. Conversion from Islam to another religion has been socially unacceptable in all areas of Somalia. According to the federal Ministry of Religious Affairs, more than 99 percent of the population is Sunni Muslim. Members of other religious groups combined constitute less than 1 percent of the population and include a small Christian community, a small Sufi Muslim community, and an unknown number of Shia Muslims. Immigrants and foreign workers, who are mainly from East African countries, belong mainly to other religious groups.

IRR was formed in 1994 and headquartered in Alexandria, Virginia. Its president was Robert T. Schmidt and officers included Benjamin F. Collins, John F. DePodesta, and Daniel Sabin.Compilation of rail notices published by the US Department of Transportation between September 16 - 30, 1996 IRR owned the following subsidiaries: Subsidiaries * Canadian American Railroad (CDAC) which operated between Brownville Junction, Maine and Lennoxville, Quebec. The line from Brownville Junction to Lennoxville was a former CP Rail mainline consisting of the Moosehead and Megantic subdivisions; at the time of acquisition it was operated by CP Rail as the Canadian Atlantic Railway. Operation was transferred by CP Rail to CDAC in early January 1995 and officially sold in March 1995. Canadian American Railroad was formed in 1994 as a joint venture by IRR (Alexandria, VA) and Fieldcrest Cannon Inc. (Kannapolis, NC); this joint venture lasted for 8 months in order to complete the acquisition of the former CP Rail property, at which time IRR purchased the interest of Fieldrest Cannon in CDAC to assume complete control. In 1996, CDAC was extended west by to Farnham, Quebec following purchase from CP Rail. At that time, CDAC received trackage rights from CP Rail over the remaining into Montreal. * Bangor and Aroostook Railroad (BAR) operated between Searsport, Maine to Madawaska, Maine with branches to Van Buren, Caribou, Presque Ile, Limestone and Houlton. Sale of the system was finalized in March 1995 through a joint venture by IRR (Alexandria, VA) and Fieldcrest Cannon Inc. (Kannapolis, NC); this joint venture lasted for 8 months in order to complete the acquisition of the BAR property, at which time IRR purchased the interest of Fieldrest Cannon in order to assume complete control. * Windsor and Hantsport Railway (WHR) which operated between Windsor Junction, Nova Scotia to New Minas, Nova Scotia with a branch from Windsor to Mantua. This was a portion of a former CP Rail subsidiary known as the Dominion Atlantic Railway. Sale of the system was completed on August 27, 1994. * Van Buren Bridge and Construction Company (VBB) which operated between Cyr Junction, New Brunswick (south of St. Leonard) to Grand Falls, New Brunswick. This was a portion of the former CP Rail Edmundston subdivision that used trackage rights over CN to access interchange with BAR at the Van Buren - St. Leonard railroad bridge. VBB leased the line in March 1994. * Quebec Southern Railway (QS) and Northern Vermont Railroad (NV), which operated between Brookport, Quebec and Wells River, Vermont. This was the former CP Rail Newport, Lyndonville and a portion of the Beebe subdivisions. Sale of the system was completed in September 1996 and extended service to the Vermont communities of Richford, Newport, St. Johnsbury and Lyndonville. * Iowa Northern Railway (IANR), which operates between Cedar Rapids, Iowa and Manly, Iowa. IANR was formed in 1980 by several grain elevator operators to maintain rail service over a former Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad line while that company entered bankruptcy. The line was purchased by IANR in 1984 and the company was purchased by Iron Road Railways in 1994. 2002 bankruptcy and divestment In 2002, IRR's \\"Bangor and Aroostook System\\" (BAR, CDAC, VBB, and QS/NV) entered bankruptcy protection and service became jeopardized. Both CN and New Brunswick Southern Railway applied to the Surface Transportation Board for permission to operate former BAR lines that served major industrial customers in northern Maine. CN was granted permission to operate from Van Buren, Maine to Madawaska, Maine, while NBSR was granted permission to operate former BAR lines from Brownville Junction south to Searsport and north to Madawaska; neither applications became necessary after the BAR lines were sold. The BAR, CDAC, and part of the QS/NV were sold in October 2002 to Rail World, Inc. which reorganized the lines under its newly formed subsidiary Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway. The NV south of Newport to Wells River, Vermont was purchased by the state of Vermont and operation contracted to Washington County Railroad. The VBB had been operated on tracks leased from owner CP Rail. In January 2003, CP Rail sold this small line to CN. Former IRR president Robert T.

Design and development The first HP-12A (HP stands for high performance) was built by a series of amateur sailplane builders, each contributing to the construction. It started off with Art Heabener of New Jersey constructing a rear fuselage from the plans for the original HP-12. The incomplete aircraft was then purchased by Tom Hall of Florida who built a set of HP-14 wings for it and then moved the incomplete aircraft to California and later to Illinois. It was in Illinois that Hall sold the still-incomplete aircraft to Rudy Kunda and Bill Carlson in 1977. They completed the aircraft in 1978. The finished aircraft retains the HP-12 rear fuselage and HP-14 wings and has added an HP-18 V-tail and the forward fuselage from an HP-10.

The phrase was first used in US v. Zettl, in 1987. An example of a substitution method is the use of code-words on a \\"key card\\", to which witnesses and the jury would refer during the trial, but which the public would not have access to. The rule is an evidentiary doctrine that tries to balance the state secrets privilege with the bill of rights (especially the right of the accused to a public trial, and the right to due process). In practice the rule has been rarely used and often challenged by judges and civil rights advocates. Its use remains controversial.  Background  The conflict between the open court and state secrets privilege goes back to at least 1802 and Marbury v. Madison. Under the privilege, the government can dismiss any charges against it by claiming that important state secrets would be revealed at trial. In 1980 the Classified Information Procedures Act (CIPA) was passed as an attempt to deal with the conflict, especially the problem of graymail. The Silent Witness Rule (SWR) is a further attempt. By 2011 the government had only attempted to use the rule a handful of times, often unsuccessfully: *United States v. Zettl 1987 (court approved, but not used due to interlocutory appeal) *United States v. Oliver North 1990 (court rejected the idea) *United States v. Fernandez 1990 (court rejected the idea) *United States v. John Walker Lindh 2001. The government planned to use the rule to protect the identities of US military personnel. The case never went to trial because Lindh made a plea bargain. *United States v. Ahmed Abu Ali 2005. The jury was given the full evidence, while the defendant was given redacted evidence. The Fourth Circuit later ruled this unconstitutional, a violation of the 6th Amendment's Confrontation Clause. = United States v. Rosen = In United States v. Rosen, in 2007 (the AIPAC Espionage Act case), the rule was used for the first real time. The government tried to use the rule extensively at first; the court rejected the idea. Rosen argued that the rule was invalid because he felt it did not match CIPA requirements, and that the government had said CIPA was the only way to deal with classified information at a trial. The judge for the trial, T. S. Ellis III, disagreed that CIPA was the only acceptable way to deal with classified information. He also felt the SWR was not really part of CIPA either. Ellis created a four-part \\"fairness test\\" to decide whether the SWR was fair. His test was a combination of the CIPA fairness test and the Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court fairness test. Ellis' theory was based on the idea that the SWR effectively \\"closes a trial\\" from the public by disclosing different sets of evidence to the court and to the public. The four parts of his test were as follows: *There must be an overriding reason to close the trial *The closure must be \\"no broader than necessary\\" *There must be no alternatives *The SWR must \\"provid[e] defendants with substantially the same ability to make their defense as full public disclosure of the evidence\\" would. Judge Ellis decided that the Rosen case met the fairness test, and approved use of the SWR at trial. It was used for 4 minutes 6 seconds of playback of a conversation. However, Ellis sealed (kept secret) the exact way that the SWR figured into the proceedings.  Arguments  Lamb argues that the SWR would enable trials to go ahead that would otherwise be dismissed because of state secrets privilege. He especially points out El-Masri v. Tenet, in which a German citizen was allegedly kidnapped and raped by CIA agents but was never allowed to present his case in court, and United States v. Reynolds, in which widows of Air Force contractors sued the government; both cases were dismissed because the government claimed the trial would reveal national secrets. The rule has received media coverage for its suggested use by the government in United States v. Drake (2010). Bishop, in the Baltimore Sun, writes that lawyers say the \\"secret codes quickly become confusing and risk violating the defendant's constitutional rights to a public trial.\\" Jesselyn Radack of the Government Accountability Project called it an \\"oxymoron,\\" and pointed out that it \\"would still allow jurors to see classified information, defeating the whole purpose of classification\\". Josh Gerstein at Politico wrote that it might create conflict between the prosecution and the news media.  See also  *State secrets privilege cases Marbury v. Madison 1803 United States v.

Over time, Mantegazza acquired motorcoaches to transport tourists around the Lake Lugano area in southern Switzerland. Boasting a fleet of 12 coaches, operating local excursions for European tourists in Switzerland, Mantegazza called his new venture Globus Viaggi. By 1950 the company operated 33 coaches with overnight excursions to Rome, Venice, the Dolomites and French Riviera. Gradually, the overnight excursions became regularly scheduled tours and grew longer to cover more ground. Later that decade, under the leadership of Werner Albek, Antonio’s business partner, Globus pioneered the concept of Grand European Touring by offering first-class European tours to United States citizens. In 1961 the group launched Cosmos (originally referred to as Cosmos Holidays) in the United Kingdom, offering value-priced European touring for the cost- conscious traveler. From 1975 under Sergio Mantegazza, son of Antonio and current president of Globus, the company's brands began expanding their markets beyond UK with packages to Africa, Australia, North and South America, Southeast Asia, Europe and the South Pacific. Also in the early 70s, Globus launched its North American company – Group Voyagers, Inc. – overseeing U.S. operations and the American market for the Globus and Cosmos brands. In 2004, Globus launched a cruise company, Avalon Waterways.\\"Avalon Waterways Celebrates a Decade in River Cruising\\" TravelAge West (June 2014) In the same year it launched Monograms, which provides consumers independent travel packages.\\"Globus Hits 80\\" Vacation Agent (September 2008) Present The Globus family of brands now consists of more than 30 tourism and aviation businesses, serviced by more than 5,000 staff.

In the accounts of the four canonical Gospels, Jesus's triumphal entry into Jerusalem takes place in the days before the Last Supper, marking the beginning of his Passion, his time of suffering, death, and resurrection celebrated during Holy Week. Christians celebrate Jesus's entry into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday, which begins a week of celebrations known as Holy Week ending with Easter Sunday. In John 12:9–11 crowds gather around Jesus and believe in him after he raised Lazarus from the dead, and the next day the multitudes that had gathered for the feast in Jerusalem welcome Jesus as he enters the city. In Matthew 21:1–11, Mark 11:1–11, Luke 19:28–44, and John 12:12–19, Jesus descends from the Mount of Olives towards Jerusalem, and the crowds lay their clothes on the ground to welcome him as he triumphantly enters Jerusalem. Gospel accounts According to the Gospels, Jesus was staying at Bethany before entering Jerusalem. John 12:1 states that he was in Bethany six days before the passover. In the synoptic gospels, Jesus sends two disciples ahead to the nearby village of Bethphage in order to retrieve a donkey and a colt and if questioned, to say that the donkey was needed by the Lord. Jesus then rode both the donkey and colt side by side Evans, Craig A., The Bible Knowledge Background Commentary: Matthew-Luke, Volume 1, 2003 page 381-395 Jesus then rode the donkey into Jerusalem, with the three synoptic gospels stating that the disciples had first put their cloaks on it (presumably to make it more comfortable). Matthew 21:7 maintains that the disciples laid their cloaks on both animals. Heinrich Meyer suggests that \\"they spread their outer garments upon both animals, being uncertain which of them Jesus intended to mount\\".Meyer's NT Commentary on Matthew 21, accessed 7 February 2017 In Luke 19:41 as Jesus approaches Jerusalem, he looks at the city and weeps over it (an event known as Flevit super illam in Latin), foretelling the suffering that awaits the city. thumb In as Jesus approaches Jerusalem, he looks at the city and weeps over it, foretelling the suffering that awaits the city.Boring, M. Eugene and Craddock, Fred B., The People's New Testament Commentary, 2004 pages 256-258 The Gospels go on to recount how Jesus rode into Jerusalem, and how the people there laid down their cloaks in front of him and also laid down small branches of trees. The people sang part of Psalm 118: 25-26: Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord. We bless you from the house of the Lord .... On his entry into the city, Matthew's account suggests that Jesus evoked great excitement - \\"all the city was moved\\". The people of the city asked \\"Who is this?\\" and \\"the multitudes\\" answered, \\"This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth of Galilee”. Significance =Prince of Peace= Bethany was located east of Jerusalem on the Mount of Olives. Zechariah 14:4 states that the Messiah would come to Jerusalem from the Mount of Olives:Majerník, Ján, Ponessa, Joesph and Manhardt, Laurie Watson. The Synoptics: Matthew, Mark, Luke, 2005 pages 133-134Also see Josephus, Flavius, Bellum Judaicum, II,13,5 and Antiquitates Judaicae, XX,8,6 Matthew 21:1-11 refers to a passage from Book of Zechariah (9:9) and states: \\"All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, Tell ye the daughter of Sion, Behold, thy King cometh unto thee, meek, and sitting upon an ass, and a colt the foal of an ass.\\" Though Jesus had been to Jerusalem several times to celebrate the feasts, his final entry into Jerusalem had a special meaning. He was solemnly entering as a humble King of peace.Mutholath, Abraham. \\"Jesus' Triumphal entry into Jerusalem\\", St. Thomas SyroMalabar Diocese of Chicago, March 21, 2018 Traditionally, entering the city on a donkey symbolizes arrival in peace, rather than as a war-waging king arriving on a horse.John 12-21 by John MacArthur 2008 pages 17-18Davies, William David and Allison, Dale C., Matthew 19-28, 2004 p. 120 The Golden Gate is located in the north section of the east wall of the Temple Mount. In Jewish belief, the gate is called 'The Gate of Mercy' (sha'ar harakhamim), and is considered to be the place from which the Messiah will enter in the end of days. According to Jewish tradition, the Shekhinah (שכינה) (Divine Presence) used to appear through the eastern Gate, and will appear again when the Anointed One (Messiah) comes (Ezekiel 44:1–3)\\"Sha'ar Harahamim\\", Agency for Jewish Education, 1995 The gate is believed to be the place from which Christ entered Jerusalem on Palm Sunday, thus implying his own messianic status.\\"Bab al-Dhahabi\\", Archnet =Sacrificial lamb= The New Testament says that Jesus traveled by way of Bethphage.

Layout Built to look more like a screw turbine than a traditional paddle steamer, Caledonia and her sister Mercury had plating carried around the sponsons. They had promenade deck saloons fore and aft with observation decks above each, linked and extended forward of the forward saloon. The navigation bridge was raised above the observation deck, forward of the single large elliptical funnel. William Denny triple expansion three-crank engines gave a maximum speed of just over 17 knots.. In 1954 Caledonia was converted from coal burning to oil fuel. Service Caledonia had a regular ferry programme connecting Gourock and Wemyss Bay with Dunoon and Rothesay. She also provided cruises to the Kyles of Bute and short cruises from Largs and Millport. HMS Goatfell during World War II In 1939 she was converted to a minesweeper and renamed HMS Goatfell. Her wartime service continued after 1941 as an anti aircraft ship. In 1946 Caledonia was returned to her owners, but in 1954 the car ferry revolution displaced her to Ayr as excursion steamer, with relief sailings from Ardrossan to Arran. In 1965 she moved up-river to Craigendoran, to replace the withdrawn , cruising round Bute for a further five years, until the disastrous economics of Clyde cruising signalled the end. In 1969 she was retired from service and sold for scrap.

Plant identified Axumite detail acting as frieze above the columns in the three arms of the crossing. The column shafts are chamfered, rising from bases upon the floor, and the capitals of the smaller columns are squared with elliptical chamfered edges.

Silent was married again in 1872 to Mary C. Tantau. This second union produced two children: Florence and Chester. Upon his admission to the bar, Silent became a partner in the San Jose law firm of Moore, Laine, & Silent. He practiced at the firm for the next decade. Meanwhile, Silent also developed interests in the railroad business, become head of a pair of lines, one running between San Jose and Santa Clara the other between Santa Cruz and Felton. Arizona Territory Upon the recommendation of Newton Booth and Aaron A. Sargent, Silent was appointed an associate justice of the Supreme Court of Arizona in February 1878. Shortly after his arrival in Prescott, the judge learned that the practice of law in Arizona was significantly better paying than that of judge. As a result, he decided he should resign. Upon learning of this intention, the 10th Arizona Territorial Legislature raised his annual salary to US$2000 more than his fellow associate justices. The Legislature also sent him with Governor Frémont to lobby in Washington D.C. to have an order by Secretary of the Interior Carl Schurz to extend the boundaries of the Gila River Indian Reservation into the Salt River Valley. In addition to his duties as a judge, Silent developed a number of business interests in mining. The Arizona Territorial Delegate to Congress John G. Campbell used the existence of these business interests in an attempt to have Judge Silent removed from office. Silent admitted to the interests but claimed they did not interfere with his duties. On June 18, 1880 an investigation by the United States Attorney General found the charges insufficient to justify removal. Silent resigned as an associate justice on October 18, 1880. He then moved to Tucson where he held a private legal practice for the next three years. In addition to his thriving legal practice, his mining interests prospered and he became quite wealthy. In 1883, Silent's health began to decline and he spent the next two years traveling in an attempt to recover. Southern California Silent settled in Los Angeles near the end of 1885. There, as a partner in the legal firm Houghton, Silent, and Campbell, he became \\"one of the leading attorneys not only of the bar of Los Angeles, but of the state of California\\". His interest in horticulture led to him accepting membership on the Los Angeles park commission. As a commission member, Silent became key in refurbishment of Pershing Square (Los Angeles). In 1897, as a means of reducing local unemployment in the city, Silent organized a beautification project for the entrance to Elysian Park. In 1907, Silent's son Chester died in a hunting accident, to which the former judge responded by largely withdrawing from his legal practice and devoting his time to real estate projects. One of these, Chester Place, was named after his son. Silent died at his Los Alisos Ranch, near Glendora, California, on December 14, 1918. His cremains were placed in a family plot at Los Angeles' Angelus- Rosedale Cemetery.

He last played as a midfielder for USL Championship club Pittsburgh Riverhounds SC, of which he was also captain. Biography Kerr is the son of a Scottish serviceman of the British forces in Germany and an English mother. For the most part he grew up in Bielefeld where he started his football career. Club career Having played for the amateur club VfL Theesen in Bielefeld, he switched to the Arminia Bielefeld youth team in summer 2003. On 7 January 2009, he signed a professional contract with Arminia Bielefeld until 2011. He also still played for the second team. On 20 March 2010, Kerr made his debut in the 2. Fußball-Bundesliga during the Ostwestfalen derby. He signed for AGOVV Apeldoorn of Netherlands' Eerste Divisie in January 2012 after his contract in Bielefeld had expired the previous summer. After AGOVV Apeldoorn declared bankruptcy and all its players became free agents, Kerr returned to Germany and played 19 matches and scored 4 goals for SC Wiedenbrück of the Fußball-Regionalliga West. On 2 April 2013, after leaving SC Wiedenbrück, Kerr signed with the Pittsburgh Riverhounds of the USL Pro, the third tier of the United States soccer league system. He made his Riverhounds debut on 13 April 2013 in a 1–2 defeat to the Harrisburg City Islanders, the first match ever held at Highmark Stadium. On the next matchday, Kerr scored his first goal for the Riverhounds in a 1–2 defeat to the Dayton Dutch Lions. Following his first two seasons with the club, in which he made 47 appearances and registered five goals and two assists, Kerr signed a new contract to remain at the club for the 2015 USL Pro season. During the first game of the season, Kerr recorded his first hat trick for the club in a 5–2 victory over in-state rivals the Harrisburg City Islanders. In total, Kerr tallied a career-high ten goals and nine assists in 26 league matches during the 2015 USL season. On 29 June 2019, Kerr recorded two assists against Birmingham Legion FC. His first assist, his 26th for the Riverhounds, set a new all-time record for the club in that statistic. On 23 January 2020, Kerr officially announced his retirement and joined the Riverhounds' Academy full-time staff. International career In early 2009, Kerr was called into training camp for the Scotland national under-21 football team by Billy Stark for the first time after stating his desire to represent Scotland. Kerr spurned opportunities to join German youth national team camps in order to represent Scotland. When he was 16, a letter inviting Kerr to join up with the Scottish team was sent to him but the club team to which it was sent said that it never received the letter.

He became a Brevet Brigadier General before the war was over. After the war he became the U.S. District Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois in Chicago. Biography =Early life and career= Leake was born in Deerfield, New Jersey, and later moved to Cincinnati, Ohio. He graduated from Miami University in 1846 and then studied law. He was admitted to the bar in 1850 and set up a practice in Davenport, Iowa. Leake was elected to the Iowa Senate and served during the war session of 1861. =Military service= Leake resigned his seat in the state senate and became a captain of Company G of the 20th Iowa Infantry. He was commissioned a Lieutenant Colonel when the regiment was organized at Camp Kirkwood in Clinton, Iowa. He led the regiment at Prairie Grove, Vicksburg, Yazoo City, and Port Hudson. On September 29, 1863, in an engagement called the Battle of Stirling's Plantation near Morganza, Louisiana Leake was injured and captured by the Confederates. He was held prisoner at Camp Ford near Tyler, Texas. He was the highest ranking Union officer in the camp and he looked after the needs of the other Union POWs. He was released from Camp Ford in a prisoner exchange in July 1864. Some of the soldiers from the 19th Iowa Infantry presented Leake with a new sword to replace the one he lost when he was taken prisoner. He returned to his regiment and participated in the capture of Fort Gaines and Fort Morgan near Mobile, Alabama. On March 13, 1865, he was awarded the rank of brevet brigadier general. The following month Leake led his regiment during the Battle of Fort Blakely in Alabama. =Later life and death= After the war Leake returned to Davenport and was re-elected to the Iowa Senate. He moved to Chicago in 1871 and was appointed the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois. On September 21, 1887, he was elected the attorney for the Chicago Board of Education. He was a member of the Ulysses S. Grant Post #28 of the Grand Army of the Republic and served as State Commander of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States from 1894 to 1895. Leake was married twice. His first wife was Cordellia Scott and he married his second wife, Mary P. Hill, on December 9, 1865. He had no children.

IRGs have been described in various mammals but are most well characterized in mice. IRG activation in most cases is induced by an immune response and leads to clearance of certain pathogens. Figure 1: Crystal structure of a Mouse IRG (PDB id 1TQ6) Background Interferon (IFN)-inducible GTPases encompass four families of proteins including myxovirus resistant proteins (Mx), guanylate-binding proteins (GBP), immunity-related GTPase proteins (IRGs), and very large inducible GTPase proteins (VLIG). IRGs confer resistance from vacuolar pathogens by localizing to and disrupting the phagocytic vacuole during infection. The activation of IRGs in mice is induced by interferon. IRG genes have been identified in various vertebrates and some invertebrates. They are involved in important immune defenses against intracellular pathogens and as a result have become a target for immune evasion by those pathogens. The intracellular protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii has been shown to target IRGs in mice allowing for resistance from the host immune response. Evolution of IRGs IRGs Have Evolved From Invertebrates Studies to determine the evolutionary origins of vertebrates have led to understanding the development of immune system processes and furthermore answer the questions of how and why pathogens have learned to evade and shut down these selectable genetic traits. Eight functional and four pseudo IRG genes have been identified in the invertebrate Branchiostoma floridiae. Li et al. determined expression patterns of functional IFN-inducible GTPase genes in Branchiostoma japonicum at various immunologic sites when induced by pathogens and pathogenic substances. This evidence suggests that IRGs may function in an immune-related capacity in cephalochordates. The paradox remains that these IRGs function without induction by IFN activation pathways, since B. japonicum and other amphioxus species do not possess IFN and IFN receptor genes. It is possible that IRGs may have existed prior to the Cambrian Explosion as an innate immune mechanism and with the evolution of the adaptive immune system in vertebrates, IFN evolved to modulate IRG function. Vertebrates have evolved an array of IRG genes as a whole, potentially due to the evolution between variable pathogen interactions. The C57BL/6 mouse has 23 IRG genes of which 21 may be functional in resistance to pathogens (6 are well characterized), whereas humans have evolved only 1 functional IRG gene (IRGM) and one pseudogene. Studies in mice have characterized the importance of the type 2 effector molecule IFNγ in various cell types and gone on to determine the importance of these proteins in intracellular pathogen resistance. Orthologous Irgc (aka: Cinema) genes are found in humans and mice. These orthologs are not IFN inducible and are expressed only in the testis of both mammals. Multiple IRG genes have been identified in canines and zebrafish but few in the model organism Tetraodontidae (the pufferfish). IRG genes in humans are thought to have been lost in the divergence of primates. The variations between and within species suggest a high rate of evolutionary change for this particular element of host pathogen interaction and highlight the importance of understanding the limitations of using model systems to study human immunology. Mechanisms Dependency on the IRGs is best exemplified in mouse studies. Multiple studies have been done using mouse knockout models to determine IRG function. Pathogen clearance mechanisms via lysosome maturation and vacuole destruction have been determined. Additionally, IRGs are implicated in the control of hematopoietic balance during infection. Irg1 knockout mice infected with Mycobacterium resulted in pancytopenia as a result of inadequate hematopoietic stem cell expansion. IRGs and Mice Figure 2: Effects of Genetic Polymorphisms. Host polymorphisms within the IRG loci can alter the ability of cells to eliminate the vacuolated pathogen. Alternatively pathogens containing coding variations in effector proteins can circumvent the cellular response to infection to generate a pathogen permissive environment. The mouse genome encodes 23 IRGs, several of which have been demonstrated to be widely expressed (liver, heart, spleen, intestine, thymus, lung, testis, kidney, brain, skin) in a number of cell types, and are greatly up-regulated following exposure to the potent immune effector molecule interferon gamma, IFNγ. IRGs are subdivided into two additional classes based on the mode of activity and mechanism. The GSK class (Irga6, Irgb6, and Irgd) are considered the canonical grouping of GTPases, whereas a second grouping of GMS proteins, which have a lysine to methionine mutation in the active site, function to prevent premature activation by associating with the nucleotide binding motif in a manner similar to Guanosine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDI's). The subcellular localization of IRGs are variable; Irga6 and Irgm3 are predominantly found within the endoplasmic reticulum, Irgm1 and Irgm2 have been localized to the Golgi apparatus, and at least two IRGs (Irgb6 and Irgd) have been found predominantly within the cytosol. Following cellular entry of Toxoplasma gondii, IRGs can quickly redistribute onto the parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM) within 2–30 minutes. The approximate order of decorating the PVM has been defined starting with the loading of Irgb6 and Irgb10 followed by Irga6, Irgd and Irgm2. Faint localization of Irgm3 on T. gondii vacuoles was also reported to occur in rare settings. Activation of the IRGs is thought to follow a GTP dependent cycle of IRG-IRG oligomerization. The loading of the \\"pioneer\\" IRGs onto the vacuole is thought to greatly enhance the recruitment of additional IRGs in a cooperative fashion. Pathogens have co-evolved unique mechanisms to interfere with different steps leading up to the association of the full complement of IRGs needed to constitute a vacuolar destructive complex. One such example was elucidated by infection with virulent and recombinant, avirulent strains of T. gondii. The intricate mechanism demonstrates a co-evolving interaction between the two species. Type I T. gondii rhoptry effector molecule Rop18, a serine-threonine kinase, was recently shown to selectively phosphorylate and inactivate the \\"pioneer\\" IRGs, thereby preventing their assembly, activation and destruction of the T. gondii vacuole within monocytes. In addition to the role of IRGs in T. gondii infection, clearance of Mycobacterium, Mtb, was also shown to be adversely affected in mice lacking Irgm1, a key negative regulatory IRG. The mechanism of clearance is thought to involve lipid interactions which aid in targeting the IRGs to Mtb containing phagosomes within macrophages. Figure 3: Following invasion by a number of obligate intracellular parasites, increases in interferon gamma lead to the increased synthesis of IRGs. The specific context and localization of the activated IRGs can lead to activation of several integrated cellular pathways resulting in either colonization of the host cell, death of the parasite, and / or death of the infected cell via one of the cell death pathways. A number of pathogens may also have effector molecules which can affect the activation of the cellular processes downstream of IRG activation. Another example of the role of IRGs in the mouse model of infection is demonstrated by the differential recruitment of IRGs which alter the outcome of Chlamydia trachomatis, a human adapted, versus Chlamydia muridarum, mouse adapted, inclusions following entry. C. trachomatis inclusions recruit a full repertoire of IRGs which aid in the inclusion elimination via fusion with lysosomes. Regulation of IRG expression and activity in this model was found to be dependent both on levels of phospholipase C, cPLA2, as well as upstream IFN signaling. cPLA2 null mouse cells, when challenged with C. trachomatis, were less capable of clearing the pathogen compared to cells with proper cPLA2 expression. The model highlights the co-evolution demonstrated by effector molecules of C. muridarum functioning to restrict accumulation of mouse IRGs on inclusions by modifying Irgb10, whereas the human pathogen is incapable of modifying the mouse IRG response. This mechanism requires additional involvement of cellular autophagy machinery, which is in contrast to the necrotic pathway activation in T. gondii clearance. A refined mechanism will require additional studies to elucidate the cooperation between the autophagy machinery and IRGs involved in the fusion of bacterial inclusions with the lysosome, as well as the specific bacterial effector molecules used to manipulate the coordinated actions of IRGs. In addition to the role of Irgm1 in parasite clearance, a cytoprotective role has been suggested in mature CD4+ T cells following exposure to IFNy in a TH1 response. Irgm1 null mice were reported to develop pancytopenia following infection with both Mycobacterium avium and Trypanosoma cruzi. This phenotype was reversed when presented in a double IFNγ/Irgm1 knockout model. These studies have provided evidence that the role of IRGs may prove to be not only spatially and temporally regulated in a highly coordinated manner, but that they have context specific auxiliary roles outside of the traditional phagolysosome development and maturation.  IRGs and Humans  There are only three putative IRG genes in humans out of which IRGM is known to be an orthologue of mouse Irgm1. There are four isoforms of IRGM (a-d). Unlike mouse IRGs, human IRGM isoforms are always expressed under the human retrovirus element ERV9 and are independent of the levels of IFNγ. IRGMb and d have a putative G5 (SAK) motif in their C terminal tail region while the other two isoforms do not. IRGMd appears diffuse in the cytoplasm and be translocated to the mitochondria appearing as punctate dots. Additionally, it has been shown to bind to mitochondrial membrane lipid, cardiolipin and influence a change in the morphology of organelle. In general human IRGs have also been shown to affect several processes such as autophagy, mitochondrial fission, change in mitochondrial membrane potential and cell death. thumb Figure 4: Putative mechanism of action of Human IRGM. Under moderate to low expression levels, IRGMs constantly survey for signals such as pathogen entry, starvation or increase in levels of IFNγ. Upon encounter with a pathogen, mitochondrial fission pathways are turned on leading to autophagy and microbial clearance promoting host cell survival. When highly expressed, IRGMd binds to the mitochondrial membrane bound lipid called cardiolipin and translocates into the mitochondria. This leads to depolarization, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and stimulates pro-apoptotic Bax/Bak dependent host cell death. Human IRGM like its mouse counterpart, has been shown to play a role in autophagy, the mechanism of which is not fully understood. LC3 is a microtubule associated soluble protein found in mammalian tissues. Cytoplasmic proteins and organelles are engulfed by autophagosomes which convert LC3-I to LC3-II. The presence of LC3-II serves as a marker for autophagy and can be detected by immunofluorescence or immunoblotting. IRGM helps to convert LC3-I to LC3-II in macrophages. IRGMs have a dual role. When expressed at very low levels, they serve to protect against intracellular pathogens but when isoforms a, c and d are over expressed it leads to cell death and inflammation. Studies indicate that lack of IRGMs are risk factors for Crohn's disease and tuberculosis. Humans use IRGM as a defense mechanism against the intracellular bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It has been found to be important in phagosome maturation and in reducing the number of intracellular mycobacteria with the help of other mitochondrial fission proteins such as DRP1 and FIs1. Under certain conditions, mitochondrial fission and its associated proteins promote autophagy whereas mitochondrial fusion inhibits the same. Under autophagy inducing conditions, IRGM also increases ROS (Reactive Oxygen Species) production. High levels of IRGMd triggers mitochondrial fission, leads to a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and causes host cell death. Fission is also linked to mitochondrial Bax/Bak dependent apoptosis and IRGMd requires these proteins to be functional. Cell death by IRGM is independent of autophagy but depends on the above-mentioned pro-apoptotic factors instead. As a consequence of IRGM induced cell death, dying and necrotic cells release nuclear HMGB1, a pro-inflammatory alarmin, implicated in Crohn’s disease.

Description The station is located at 3400 West 8600 South but, although the station is situated immediately south of 8600 South, there is not direct vehicle access to the station's parking from that street, only by way of 3200 West. Also, while it is the closest TRAX station to Bangerter Highway (SR-154), there is no direct access to the station from Bangerter Highway either. The station can be reached from Bangerter Highway by heading east on 9000 South, then north on 3200 West, and finally west on 8660 South. The station is just northeast of the Jordan Valley Medical Center. In the early planning stages, the station was referred to as \\"Bangerter Station\\", but later changed to the current name. The station opened August 7, 2011, as part of the Red Line (Mid-Jordan) and is operated by the Utah Transit Authority. Original plans for the station included a large Park and Ride lot with 577 free (UTA exclusive) parking spaces. However, two parking garages have been built at the station and provide 845 spaces. The fee for parking in either of the garage is $1 per day or $15 per month, however, payment is only required for parking from 6 am to 6 pm Monday through Friday, except holidays. Jordan Valley is the only TRAX station with a parking garage. Since their construction, the parking garages have had very little use; as low as 3 percent, according to UTA.

It is one of the last significant remnants of tropical moist evergreen forest and premontane cloud forest in the region between the Andes mountains and the Pacific Ocean in Ecuador. It is estimated that only 2% of the native forest still remains in coastal Ecuador. The Jama-Coaque Ecological Reserve is owned and managed by Third Millennium Alliance and partner Grupo Ecologico Jama-Coaque, both non-profit conservation foundations in their respective countries. It is part of the Tumbes-Chocó-Magdalena biodiversity hotspot as designated by Conservation International.  Location  The Jama- Coaque Ecological Reserve is located along the Jama-Coaque Coastal Mountain Range in northwestern Ecuador, in the Pacific Equatorial Forest. It is 19 kilometers south of the equator and 7 kilometers inland from the Pacific Ocean in the Upper Camarones River Basin. It is 3 kilometers inland from the small agricultural community of Camarones and approximately equidistant from the mid-sized coastal towns of Jama and Pedernales in the province of Manabí. The Bamboo House Research Station within the reserve is located at 0° 06’56.8” S, 80°07’29.5” W.  History  The Jama-Coaque Ecological Reserve was established by Third Millennium Alliance in 2007, initially as a 95-acre (38 hectare) private reserve along the peak of the coastal mountain range. From 2008-2011, the reserve expanded to 586 acres (237 hectares) through 5 subsequent land purchases, and presently covers 57% of the Upper Camarones River Basin. The reserve takes its name from the ancient kingdom that thrived in the region from 355 B.C. to 1532 A.D.  Ecology  The Jama-Coaque Ecological Reserve climbs from 846 feet (256 meters) elevation, along the Camarones River, to a maximum elevation of 2,290 feet (698 meters) elevation at the peak of Cerro Sagrado mountain. The lowland part of the reserve is characterized by tropical moist evergreen forest and transition to tropical rainforest. Starting at approximately 1,900 feet (580 meters) of elevation, the forest rapidly transitions to premontane cloud forest, owing to the nearly constant fog layer along the crests of the coastal mountain range. The Jama- Coaque Ecological Reserve protects the headwaters of the Camarones River and three tributaries.  Climate  The Jama-Coaque Ecological Reserve is subject to a tropical monsoon climate. Although it receives abundant rainfall like that of the tropical rain forest climate, rainfall is concentrated in the high-sun season, which is late December through May. The reserve is located onshore from the changeover between the Humboldt and El Niño ocean currents, which place it at the transition zone between some of the wettest forests in the world (the Chocó rainforests in Colombia) and the driest desert in the world (the Atacama in Peru and Chile). Starting in late December, a change in atmospheric pressure shifts ocean currents so that warm waters from the El Niño current come closer to shore and displace the cold waters of the Humboldt current. The result is warmer air temperatures and heavy rainfall that used to last through August, but now usually only lasts into May. The dry season, which now begins in June or July and can last into mid January, is characterized by cooler temperatures and more overcast skies. The Bamboo House research station in the Jama-Coaque Ecological Reserve records an average daily temperature range of 24-31° Celsius (75-88° Fahrenheit) in the rainy season and 19-28° Celsius (66-82° Fahrenheit) in the dry season. Annual rainfall in the lowland moist forests of the Jama-Coaque Ecological Reserve averages 1,000-1,500 mm. The total annual water intake of the cloud forest is estimated to exceed 2000 mm, owing to fog drip, a process in which moisture from the clouds the hover along the peaks of the mountains is stripped by the surfaces of vegetation and condenses into water that drips to the forest floor. Wildlife The Jama-Coaque Ecological Reserve serves as habitat and key migratory channel for six endangered species of felines (jaguar, puma, ocelot, oncilla, margay, and jaguarundi) and two endangered species of primates (mantled howler monkey and white-fronted capuchin monkey). Other endangered mammals include the tayra, the three-toed sloth, the western agouti, and the spotted paca. In 2009, herpetologist Paul S. Hamilton discovered two new species of frog in the cloud forest of the Jama-Coaque Ecological Reserve.

Its main goal is nature conservation. The European Wildlife key objective is to conserve biological diversity and to reduce the impact of climate changes on nature and humankind. The main objective of European Wildlife is creating of non-state reserves and bio-corridors which would connect places with the most valuable biodiversity in Europe.  History  The non-profit organization European Wildlife was established in 2008. It was founded by Dalibor Dostal, a journalist and a former editor in chief of one of the most popular serious newspaper in the Czech Republic. In 2010 the European Wildlife starts its main project – the European Centre of Biodiversity, which should act as a “Noah’s Ark” of endangered species of plants and animals in Europe.  Main goals  The main objective of the European Wildlife is creating of non-state reserves and bio-corridors which would connect places with the most valuable biodiversity in Europe. However, its most significant project is to establish a European Centre of Biodiversity, a big non-state nature reserve in Central Europe. Among other priorities of the European Wildlife is the climate change. As well as contributing to the deceleration of climate changes, its projects also engage in reforestation. Planting of new trees means better absorption of carbon dioxide which is a by-product of European factories, transport and households. Interconnecting the places with the abundance of wildlife diversity helps Europe adapt to the impacts of climate changes. While new forests help retaining the water in the landscape, biocorridors help the microorganisms endangered by rise in temperatures and climate fluctuations.  The European Bison Symbol  The well-known symbol of the European Wildlife conservation organization contains a silhouette of the European Bison. The European Bison is a symbol of a successful effort that was invested towards the rescue of animal species in situations where it seemed hopeless. All protectionist projects draw inspiration from that rescue of animals which were among the minority of the last ones to survive the First World War. Moreover, it is the largest land animal in Europe. The European Bison also has a positive influence on European ecosystems. A number of species such as rare butterflies are becoming extinct only because there are no big herbivores living in Europe. Since 2009 the orange and black and white logo with the silhouette of the animal in an orange square has been a trademark of the European Wildlife organisation in all countries of European Union registered by Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market (OHIM).  European Centre of Biodiversity  The most significant project of the European Wildlife is to establish the European Centre of Biodiversity, a big non-state nature reserve in Central Europe. Its placement is important in terms of maintaining biodiversity of the whole continent. That is because Central Europe now separates populations of wild animals which live in Northern, Eastern and Southern Europe. The establishment of European centre of biodiversity should be an important step towards their mutual interconnection and thus maintaining wildlife diversity in Europe long-term. The European Wildlife aim is to create a reserve which would be ten times ten kilometres large. The objective is to create an area big enough, a forest with a natural variety of woody species which, in future, would enable endangered species – especially large European mammals – to return. Some species such as European bison will be brought back again.

History  = Founded after the Civil War = Jesse Fell supported the foundation of the orphans' home by generous donations. Originally known as the Civil War Orphans' Home, ISSCS was established in 1865 by an act of the Illinois State legislature as a home for the indigent children of Civil War veterans. Jesse W. Fell, David Davis and other prominent residents of Bloomington and Normal pledged cash and land for the home. The State of Illinois selected Normal as the site of the home in May 1867 and set up three temporary facilities in Bloomington and Springfield to serve the children during construction. The Illinois Soldiers' Orphans' Home (ISOH) opened its doors on June 17, 1869 with 180 children in residence and one main building. Mrs. Virginia C. Ohr, a widow of a Civil War veteran, served as the home's first superintendent. Her tenure was controversial and included accusations of mistreatment of the children. A board of trustees operated the home and acted as legal guardian for the children. = After the Spanish–American War = In 1899, following the Spanish–American War, the Civil War Orphans' Home was amended to allow the children of soldiers and sailors of the Spanish–American War and the school began accepting children whose fathers had served in the army or navy during any war. From 1907-1924 dependent orphans who were not children of veterans also were admitted to the home when space was available. In the succeeding years indigent children of veterans of all wars became eligible for admission. = Administration = Girls Cottages with the occupants in the foreground, approximately in 1907 ISSCS was initially operated by a Board of Trustees, its first president in 1867 was Gustav Koerner, and inspected by the Board of State Commissioners of Public Charities created in 1869 to inspect and report upon the conditions in all state charitable institutions. The Board of Administration succeeded to these duties and retained executive and administrative control over the home until the creation of the Department of Public Welfare in 1917. While under the jurisdiction of the Department of Public Welfare the home's name was changed to the Illinois Soldiers' and Sailors' Children's School in 1931. The department also was authorized to place veterans' indigent children in foster homes or in other child-care facilities. This responsibility was handled by Division of Child Welfare staff members working at the school. It was finally transferred to the Department of Children and Family Service in 1963. In 1916, the nearby Illinois State Normal University (ISNU) began administering the school's education programs which were held on-site until 1961 when ISSCS students began attending ISNU's University High School and Metcalf School. Following the opening of the home, numerous expansion projects began to fulfill the needs of the children. In 1872, construction was completed on a kitchen, laundry, boiler house, steam heating plant and school. A hospital was added in 1881, which would become an industrial training building for girls when a new hospital was constructed in 1899. More renovations followed in 1889, adding a chapel, dining hall, play rooms and bathrooms in the main building. An electric light plant and industrial education building would later be added. As studies began to reveal the benefits of a home-like environment for orphans, the Illinois Soldiers' Orphans' Home adapted, building five cottages for girls in 1904. Eventually, the home would include 25 cottages along Girls' Row, Boys' Row and the Children's Village. By 1937, all children at the home would live in the cottages under the supervision of housemothers and housefathers. These cottages allowed for more individualized attention in a family-like environment. Appearance also bolstered the children's personal identity when state-issued clothing replaced uniforms beginning in 1927, allowing the children some choice in their clothes. By the late 1940s, as the numbers of children in foster care increased, the school began receiving higher numbers of delinquents and students with psychological or behavioral problems. In 1969, ISSCS celebrated its centennial and with it came new housing for the girls. The Y-shaped cottages allowed the children more privacy in a dorm-like atmosphere. = Closure = Despite these changes, high per capita cost of care, building deterioration and the dwindling number of children caused the state to opt for alternative forms of care for dependent orphans. In 1979, the state closed ISSCS after 114 years in operation. Today, many of the remaining buildings on the former campus have been converted to businesses or residences, while others remain abandoned. Children who died while in the care of the school, were originally buried at a site on campus, but were later moved to a plot in the Evergreen Memorial Cemetery in Bloomington. There is a second plot for children who died after the move. In July 2017 the ISSCS Administration Building was demolished by Stark Excavation. The owner of the property, Nicholas Africano, agreed with the Town of Normal to demolish the building for $500,000.

Melanie Smith is an artist based in Mexico City. Her work has been characterized by a certain re-reading of the formal and aesthetic categories of avant-gardes and post-avant-garde movements, problematized at the sites and within the horizons of heterotopias. Her production is intimately related to a certain expanded vision of the notion of modernity, maintaining a relationship both with what this means in Latin America, particularly in Mexico, and with the implication this has for her formal explorations as a critical moment in the aesthetic- political structure of modernity and late modernity.  Biography  Melanie Smith was born in 1965 in Poole, England. She studied painting at the University of Reading and she developed a post-minimalist aesthetics, and received her Bachelor of Arts. Since 1989 she has lived and worked in Mexico City, an experience that has enormously influenced her works ever since. “1989, she moved to Mexico City, joining an international community of artists and writers there. Her work was included in the first exhibition of installation art in Mexico, curated by Guillermo Santamarina at the Museum of the Ex-Convento de los Leones.” From then on, the city played an important role in her performances and art works. In Mexico City, she experimented with installations, videos, films, photographs, and paintings with redoing and retouching to her endless imaginary world. Smith’s works have the tension between chaos, and order forms of violence within the industrial society, and the economy.  Works  Her earlier pieces considered Mexico City itself, recording its multitudes, its violence, its banality, and its clandestine nature and at the same time its inherent decomposition. The most outstanding piece from this cycle is the video Spiral City (2002). In another of her works, she broadens the notions of place and non-place by documenting the small town of Parres on the outskirts of the city. She produced a trilogy of 35mm films and a series of paintings and installations that rework the modernist idea of the monochromatic. For her 2002 film, Spiral City, Smith rented a helicopter to fly over east of Mexico City. Her film is based on an abstract grid of the city following the movements of a helicopter flying in widening spirals. Her videos and films are made in collaboration with cinematographer Rafael Ortega and also include a series of paintings and photographs. Smith’s work engages directly with the city from above. > Even from a great height and even as its configurations dissolve in the > light there is no end to this city; this is saturated urbanism, drained of > colour, no monuments, no green spaces, no river. The starting point was > Ixtapalapa, a very poor, satellite city of endless identical streets of low- > rise houses. Spiral City alienates the world below, the world that is known, and abstracts it from the lens of a helicopter. This video draws attention to various image patterns and abstractions that would normally be invisible to the naked eye. According to The Guardian, this film is meant to be “a testament to a city that is subject to a crystalline-like erosion, whereby structures build upon each other and collapse, as well as being a haunting cartography of the future.” What Smith means by this is that the city is continuously being built upon; because of this constant building there is too much chaos, which in turn causes a collapse. Since this cycle is repeated, she argues, it is a map for what the future will hold. Another work of Smith’s, Orange Lush (1995), is a series of several installations of objects on boards. These installations contained “bright orange plastic objects, among them life-preservers, extension cords, buoys, cheerleader’s pom-poms, water-wings, flip-flops, light bulbs, balloons, and water rafts.” Although the objects seem to be placed randomly, their placement is actually well thought out. There are slight contrasts between rounded objects and objects that are deflated and flattened. This, argues art historian Amanda Boetzkes, is meant to convey “a broader stalemate between sensorial plenitude and economic exhaustion.” Orange Lush performs an aesthetic critique of Mexico’s consumerist economy and the overflowing need for “stuff”. Smith chose the chemical orange color because to her it always screamed “for sale”, which was fitting for the statement she is making about Mexican consumerism. Also, Boetzkes says the color orange “marked the invasion of Mexico City with cheap commodities in the 1990s, after inflation and bailouts from the United States and the Bank for International Settlements caused a devaluation of the peso.” This event describes the exhaustion of economics that Smith tries to bring into her Orange Lush piece. Orange is commonly known as the color of fake value and meaningless products. This is something that Smith calls “chemically induced enthusiasm,” which means it is fabricated happiness or excitement—it is not reality. This is what global consumption is; there is momentary gratification and then it means nothing. Lastly, one of Smith’s big collaborative performance pieces is Aztec Stadium (2010), done with 3,000 secondary school students, and the whole process was filmed. Smith also partnered with Rafael Ortega on this project. Each student had a tile, which, once held up, created large mosaics based on the history of Mexico. Some examples of the images used were “Malevich’s Red Square, as well as from Mexican nationalist imaginaries and even from the popular imaginaries of mass culture, such as the mythical wrestler Santo, wearer of the silver mask.” This process was experimental because the outcome was not always known. As the process went on, students had difficulty following instructions, causing the images to become. There were waves of chaos and control throughout the whole piece, which ended up becoming a large part of the piece. This tension between chaos and order also reflects the how Mexico City functions and how the economy reflects that. Smith contaminates abstraction through chaos and order throughout three major works, Orange Lush, Spiral City, and Malleable Deed at Aztec Stadium. Orange Lush focuses on ascribing a bright orange color to objects that have been commercialized, thrown out, and have no value, in order to abstract them and create new forms. Spiral City alienates the world below and abstracts the world through the lens of a helicopter. The film, Malleable Deed, at Aztec Stadium shows how the chaos of thousands of people can quickly work together to show a system of order. All three works prove that Smith can work through chaos and abstract different mediums to create a system of order.  Exhibitions  Her work has been exhibited at numerous institutions, both nationally and internationally, including: PS1, New York; MoMA, New York, UCLA Hammer Museum, Los Angeles; ICA, Boston; Tate Liverpool; Tate Modern, London; South London Gallery, London; Lima Art Museum; Tamayo Contemporary Art Museum, Contemporary Art University Museum and El Eco Experimental Museum, Mexico City; and Monterrey Museum, among others.

Although it most closely resembles the original game as developed in Chicago in the 19th century by George Hancock, today it remains popular almost exclusively in Chicago and New Orleans but is also popular in Portland, Oregon, where mushball has had leagues since the 1960s, and Atlanta, Georgia. In 1980, Bill \\"Doc\\" Williams introduced blooperball to Nashville. Williams — a Chicago Cubs fan since 1945 (he was a ballboy for Cubs affiliate Nashville Vols that year) — was very well known in Nashville softball circles at that time, thus making the debut of \\"big ball\\" to the Tennessee capital more successful than would otherwise have been the case. The sport saw its popularity in Music City wane by about 1985. The first set of rules were published in 1937 by the Amateur Softball Association, in the same manual as the rules for fastpitch softball. Game play Game play for 16-inch softball is mostly consistent with standard softball game play. In contrast to standard, or 12-inch (30.48 cm) softball, it is played with a ball 16 inches (40.64 cm) in circumference. Leagues may form co-ed, all-male, or all-female teams. Additionally, teams may choose competitive or recreational leagues. There may be rule variations associated with the specific field or league of play. When playing in a co-ed league, there may be other rules that apply related to the male to female ratio of team members and batting order. The National Softball Association (NSA) also has a published set of rules governing 16-inch softball play. History The earliest known softball game of any kind was played at the Farragut Boat Club in Chicago on Thanksgiving Day 1887. The first softball was a wrapped up boxing glove and the bat was a broom. Play was encouraged by a reporter, George Hancock, who had been looking on. Harvard and Yale students played the game while waiting to hear the results of the annual Harvard-Yale football game. Until the turn of the 20th century, ball sizes ranged from 12 to 17 inches in circumference. The 16-inch softball was eventually adopted in Chicago, perhaps because it didn't travel as far as the popular 12- or 14-inch balls. This also may have allowed for play on smaller playgrounds or even indoors, accommodating the Chicago landscape and climate. Another possible advantage of the 16-inch ball was that it allowed everyone to play barehanded, and gloves were a rare luxury as the Great Depression hit Chicago particularly hard. After the first national championship held in 1933 at the Century of Progress World's Fair, the sport grew in popularity. A professional league was formed that lasted through the 1950s. Teams drew crowds of over 10,000 each night. Leagues continue today but not at the same level of popularity. There are co-ed recreational leagues, competitive leagues and even a league for Chicago Public School students. League and tournament play Many local organizations host regular season play, typically weekly games, as well as their own playoff systems. National organizations, such as the NSA, host a variety of tournaments. By placing well in NSA tournaments, teams can qualify and compete for the 16-inch softball world series. Because local leagues may have slight variations in rules, the NSA world series is played by its own set of world series rules. One notable change is that Chicago area players, who typically are not allowed to wear gloves, may choose to wear gloves in world series games. Blooperball In the Bay City, Michigan area the game is known as \\"blooperball.\\" Blooperball has been played in the area continuously since the 1930s and there is a ten- team league for players forty years old and over, as well as a charity blooperball event called \\"The Rehab,\\" which has been held the weekend after Labor Day for almost forty years. Games are played with a deBeer Clincher 16\\" ball and gloves are used. Hall of Fame In 1996 Al Maag and Tony Reibel established the 16\\" Softball Hall of Fame.

Her company \\"gets much of its energy from small local energy producers, including a handful of hydropower operations, solar panels, some wind turbines, and about 20 washing-machine-size co-generation plants in people’s homes that produce both heat for the home and electricity for the grid\\". Sladek has also been interested in finding ways of rendering nuclear power unnecessary in Germany: Sladek won a Goldman Environmental Prize in 2011. Background > In 1986, she was a homemaker and the mother of five school-age children when > some radioactive isotopes blown into the air by the explosion at the > Chernobyl nuclear power plant in the Ukraine landed around her town, > Schönau, in the Black Forest in western Germany. Her children could not play > outdoors for two weeks; 25 years later, that forest’s mushrooms are still > considered unsafe. Trained as a schoolteacher, Sladek began to study the energy industry in Germany to see if there were ways to decrease dependence on nuclear power. Together with her husband, Michael Sladek, she formed a group called \\"Parents for a Nuclear Free Future\\" to promote energy efficiency in the Black Forest region of Germany, and return control of energy production and distribution to the community. In 1991, when the previous power company's lease to supply power to the Schönau region was up for renewal, Sladek and her partners began a nationwide fundraising effort to enable them to take ownership of the local power grid. They were able to raise 6 million DM (about 3 million Euros) and by 1997 had established the Schönau Power Supply as a community operated energy provider committed to a sustainable energy future. The Schönau Power Supply uses a decentralized approach to power generation, and makes use of renewable energy sources, including solar, hydroelectric, wind power, and biomass. The company is operated as a cooperative; while the cooperative owners receive dividends, the majority of the profits are re-invested in renewable energy sources. Total revenues reached 67 million Euros in 2009 Awards and recognition Ursula Sladek has won many awards for her work in the fields of energy conservation and renewable energy production, including the German Federal Cross of Merit, the Henry Ford European Conservation Award, the German Founder of the Year Award, the International Nuclear-Free Future Award, the German Energy Prize, and the European Solar Prize, and was elected an Ashoka Fellow in 2008.

After the Han dynasty aided Nanyue in fending off an invasion by Minyue, Zhao Mo sent his son Yingqi to the Han court, where he joined the emperor’s guard (宿衛, Sù wèi). Zhao Yingqi married a Han Chinese woman from the Jiu (樛氏) family of Handan, who gave birth to his second son, Zhao Xing. Yingqi behaved without any scruples and committed murder on several occasions.

Part of the now decommissioned Carlsberg Brewery site, it combines a double-arched gateway, from which it takes its name, with a clock tower. The name which simply means \\"double gate\\" in Greek, refers to a gateway in the north-west of ancient Athens. History Vesterbro Designed by Vilhelm Dahlerup, the Dipylon structure was built in 1892, at a time when the Ny Carlsberg complex was still under redevelopment and far from finished. The gateway of the lower part marked the Vesterbro-side entrance to the Ny Carlsberg complex, complementing the Elephant Gate to the west which afforded access to the brewery from the Valby side. Above the gateway, the building originally contained two malting floors. Through two valves, one in each arch, malt mash could be poured into waiting wagons. Architecture and artwork The front side, facing Vesterbro The portrait frieze The Bell Strikers The Dipylon building is built in red brick in the ornate Historicist style which is typical both of the Carlsberg area in general and especially of Vilhelm Dahlerup's work. The arches have granite rustication. Above them there is a diagonal pattern in glazed and red tiles. On the front (Vesterbro) side of the building, an integrated sign above the arches simply reads \\"Ny Carlsberg\\". Similarly placed on the rear (courtyard) side of the structure, there is a plate which is inscribed with a quotation from J.C. Jacobsen's will which was later adopted by Carl Jacobsen as a motto: On the rear side of the gate building, a frieze consisting of nine tile paintings depicts various key figures in the construction and operation of brewery. In the centre stands Carl Jacobsen, flanked by his wife, Ottilia, and his son Alf who was the chosen heir but died in 1890 shortly before the building was completed. The other figures are Carl’s closest collaborators in building the brewery, Vilhelm Dahlerup and master builder S. P. Beckmann, and, representing the brewery’s employees, Professor Christian Grønlund, office manager R. Hesberg, chief inspector V. Henningsen, and an ordinary brewery worker. On the upper part of the building is a double-faced clock created by leading Danish clockmaker Julius Bertram Larsen. Its roof-top bell is flanked by the Bell strikers, a group statue by Stephan Sinding.

Netzer, \\"Erza-Nama\\", Encyclopedia Iranica composed by the Judeo-Persian Shahin. The work which is of 500 distichs, is generally found at the end of Shahin's Ardashir-nama and is composed in the same meter. It was probably completed around April–May 1372 Plot The story deals with Cyrus the Great who was called \\"God's Messiah\\". According to ʿEzrā- nāma, Cyrus was born of Esther and Ahaseurus, King of Persia. The legend was created to possibly answer to important question with regards to Jewish history, the Talmud and the midrashim; how come a gentile was elected \\"God's Messiah\\";why were the Jews freed in Babylon through Cyrus the Great. The Book of Ester retells that Cyrus was seated on the throne of the King Solomon, an honor that had not been granted to the kings of Israel. Shahin however portrays Cyrus as Esther's son and hence as Jew through his mother (Jewish identity being passed through the mother). In this Jewish Persian epic poem, the birth of Cyrus is depicted as a divine gift. Cyrus shows grace, beauty and goodness as a child. He is presented as a divine figure in parallel with prophets and king of Israel. In the poem, his sense of truth, justice and bravery are shown to be unrivaled among the kings of the world. The story then retells the struggle of 'Ezra to rebuild the temple after its destruction of the temple by Nebuchadnezzar. Ezra asks the Jewish people to meet Cyrus and talk to him about their peoplehood. Ezra asks Cyrus to liberate the Jews from torture and let them return to their Holy Land. The drama of freeing the Jews from Babylonian yoke and restoration of their existence is illustrated vividly in the 'Ezra-nama. Cyrus the Great who is depicted as ruling by the will of God is depicted as hero. After his death, a long eulogy about him brings to end the third of the story. The poet finishes the poem by describing the death of Esther and Mordechai and their burial in the city of Hamadan.
