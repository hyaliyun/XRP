In most religions which accept polytheism, the different gods and goddesses are representations of forces of nature or ancestral principles, and can be viewed either as autonomous or as aspects or emanations of a creator deity or transcendental absolute principle (monistic theologies), which manifests immanently in nature (panentheistic and pantheistic theologies).* Ulrich Libbrecht. Within the Four Seas...: Introduction to Comparative Philosophy. Peeters Publishers, 2007. . p. 42. Polytheism is a type of theism. Within theism, it contrasts with monotheism, the belief in a singular God, in most cases transcendent. Polytheists do not always worship all the gods equally, but they can be henotheists, specializing in the worship of one particular deity. Other polytheists can be kathenotheists, worshiping different deities at different times. Polytheism was the typical form of religion during the Bronze Age and Iron Age up to the Axial Age and the development of Abrahamic religions, the latter of which enforced strict monotheism. It is well documented in historical religions of Classical antiquity, especially ancient Greek religion and ancient Roman religion, and after the decline of Greco- Roman polytheism in tribal religions such as Germanic, Slavic and Baltic paganism. Notable polytheistic religions practiced today include Taoism, Shenism or Chinese folk religion, Japanese Shinto, Santer√≠a, most Traditional African religions and various neopagan faiths. Hinduism denies being exclusively either monotheistic or polytheistic, sometimes believing to be monotheistic but declining to polytheism with many Hindu schools regarding it as henotheistic. The Vedanta philosophy of Hinduism secludes the idea of Hinduism being monotheistic along with the belief that Brahman is the cause of everything and the universe itself being the manifestation of Brahman. Terminology The term comes from the Greek œÄŒøŒªœç poly (\\"many\\") and Œ∏ŒµœåœÇ theos (\\"god\\") and was first invented by the Jewish writer Philo of Alexandria to argue with the Greeks. When Christianity spread throughout Europe and the Mediterranean, non-Christians were just called Gentiles (a term originally used by Jews to refer to non-Jews) or pagans (locals) or by the clearly pejorative term idolaters (worshiping \\"false\\" gods). The modern usage of the term is first revived in French through Jean Bodin in 1580, followed by Samuel Purchas's usage in English in 1614. Soft versus hard A central, main division in modern polytheistic practices is between soft polytheism and hard polytheism. \\"Hard\\" polytheism is the belief that gods are distinct, separate, real divine beings, rather than psychological archetypes or personifications of natural forces. Hard polytheists reject the idea that \\"all gods are one god.\\" \\"Hard\\" polytheists do not necessarily consider the gods of all cultures as being equally real, a theological position formally known as integrational polytheism or omnism. For hard polytheists, gods are individual and not only different names for the same being. This is often contrasted with \\"soft\\" polytheism, which holds that different gods may be aspects of only one god, that the pantheons of other cultures are representative of one single pantheon, psychological archetypes or personifications of natural forces. In this way, gods may be interchangeable for one another across cultures. Gods and divinity Bulul statues serve as avatars of rice deities in the Anitist beliefs of the Ifugao in the Philippines. The deities of polytheism are often portrayed as complex personages of greater or lesser status, with individual skills, needs, desires and histories; in many ways similar to humans (anthropomorphic) in their personality traits, but with additional individual powers, abilities, knowledge or perceptions. Polytheism cannot be cleanly separated from the animist beliefs prevalent in most folk religions. The gods of polytheism are in many cases the highest order of a continuum of supernatural beings or spirits, which may include ancestors, demons, wights and others. In some cases these spirits are divided into celestial or chthonic classes, and belief in the existence of all these beings does not imply that all are worshipped. Types of deities Types of deities often found in polytheism may include * Creator deity * Culture hero * Death deity (chthonic) * Life-death-rebirth deity * Love goddess * Mother goddess * Political deity (such as a king or emperor) * Sky deity (celestial) * Solar deity * Trickster deity * Water deity * Lunar deity * Gods of music, arts, science, farming or other endeavors. Religion and mythology In the Classical era, Sallustius (4th century AD) categorised mythology into five types: # Theological # Physical # Psychological # Material # Mixed The theological are those myths which use no bodily form but contemplate the very essence of the gods: e.g., Cronus swallowing his children. Since divinity is intellectual, and all intellect returns into itself, this myth expresses in allegory the essence of divinity. Myths may be regarded physically when they express the activities of gods in the world. The psychological way is to regard (myths as allegories of) the activities of the soul itself and or the soul's acts of thought. The material is to regard material objects to actually be gods, for example: to call the earth Gaia, ocean Okeanos, or heat Typhon. Ancient religions Some well-known historical polytheistic pantheons include the Sumerian gods and the Egyptian gods, and the classical-attested pantheon which includes the ancient Greek religion and Roman religion. Post-classical polytheistic religions include Norse √Üsir and Vanir, the Yoruba Orisha, the Aztec gods, and many others. Today, most historical polytheistic religions are referred to as \\"mythology\\",Eugenie C. Scott, Evolution Vs. Creationism: An Introduction (2009), p. 58. though the stories cultures tell about their gods should be distinguished from their worship or religious practice. For instance deities portrayed in conflict in mythology would still be worshipped sometimes in the same temple side by side, illustrating the distinction in the devotees mind between the myth and the reality. Scholars such as Jaan Puhvel, J. P. Mallory, and Douglas Q. Adams have reconstructed aspects of the ancient Proto-Indo- European religion, from which the religions of the various Indo-European peoples derive, and that this religion was an essentially naturalist numenistic religion. An example of a religious notion from this shared past is the concept of *dyƒìus, which is attested in several distinct religious systems. In many civilizations, pantheons tended to grow over time. Deities first worshipped as the patrons of cities or places came to be collected together as empires extended over larger territories. Conquests could lead to the subordination of the elder culture's pantheon to a newer one, as in the Greek Titanomachia, and possibly also the case of the √Üsir and Vanir in the Norse mythos. Cultural exchange could lead to \\"the same\\" deity being renowned in two places under different names, as seen with the Greeks, Etruscans, and Romans, and also to the cultural transmission of elements of an extraneous religion into a local cult, as with worship of the ancient Egyptian deity Osiris, which was later followed in ancient Greece. Most ancient belief systems held that gods influenced human lives. However, the Greek philosopher Epicurus held that the gods were living, incorruptible, blissful beings who did not trouble themselves with the affairs of mortals, but who could be perceived by the mind, especially during sleep. Epicurus believed that these gods were material, human-like, and that they inhabited the empty spaces between worlds. Hellenistic religion may still be regarded as polytheistic, but with strong monistic components, and monotheism finally emerges from Hellenistic traditions in Late Antiquity in the form of Neoplatonism and Christian theology. ;Neolithic Era * Serer religion ;Bronze Age to Classical Antiquity * Religions of the Ancient Near East ** Ancient Egyptian religion ** Ancient Semitic religion * Historical Vedic religion * Ancient Greek religion * Ancient Roman religion * Celtic polytheism ;Late Antiquity to High Middle Ages * Germanic paganism * Slavic paganism * Baltic paganism * Finnish paganism Ancient Greece The classical scheme in Ancient Greece of the Twelve Olympians (the Canonical Twelve of art and poetry) were: Zeus, Hera, Poseidon, Athena, Ares, Demeter, Apollo, Artemis, Hephaestus, Aphrodite, Hermes, and Hestia. Though it is suggested that Hestia stepped down when Dionysus was invited to Mount Olympus, this is a matter of controversy. Robert Graves' The Greek Myths cites two sources that obviously do not suggest Hestia surrendered her seat, though he suggests she did. Hades was often excluded because he dwelt in the underworld. All of the gods had a power. There was, however, a great deal of fluidity as to whom was counted among their number in antiquity. Different cities often worshipped the same deities, sometimes with epithets that distinguished them and specified their local nature. The Hellenic Polytheism extended beyond mainland Greece, to the islands and coasts of Ionia in Asia Minor, to Magna Graecia (Sicily and southern Italy), and to scattered Greek colonies in the Western Mediterranean, such as Massalia (Marseille). Greek religion tempered Etruscan cult and belief to form much of the later Roman religion. Folk religions The animistic nature of folk beliefs is an anthropological cultural universal. The belief in ghosts and spirits animating the natural world and the practice of ancestor worship is universally present in the world's cultures and re-emerges in monotheistic or materialistic societies as \\"superstition\\", belief in demons, tutelary saints, fairies or extraterrestrials. The presence of a full polytheistic religion, complete with a ritual cult conducted by a priestly caste, requires a higher level of organization and is not present in every culture. In Eurasia, the Kalash are one of very few instances of surviving polytheism. Also, a large number of polytheistic folk traditions are subsumed in contemporary Hinduism, although Hinduism is doctrinally dominated by monist or monotheist theology (Bhakti, Advaita). Historical Vedic polytheist ritualism survives as a minor current in Hinduism, known as Shrauta. More widespread is folk Hinduism, with rituals dedicated to various local or regional deities. Modern religions Buddhism In Buddhism, there are higher beings commonly designed (or designated) as gods, Devas; however, Buddhism, at its core (the original Pali canon), does not teach the notion of praying nor worship to the Devas or any god(s). However, in Buddhism, the core leader 'Buddha', who pioneered the path to enlightenment is not worshiped in meditation, but simply reflected upon. Statues or images of the Buddha (Buddharupas) are worshiped in front of to reflect and contemplate on qualities that the particular position of that rupa represents. In Buddhism, there is no creator and the Buddha rejected the idea that a permanent, personal, fixed, omniscient deity can exist, linking into the core concept of impermanence (anicca). Devas, in general, are beings who have had more positive karma in their past lives than humans. Their lifespan eventually ends. When their lives end, they will be reborn as devas or as other beings. When they accumulate negative karma, they are reborn as either human or any of the other lower beings. Humans and other beings could also be reborn as a deva in their next rebirth, if they accumulate enough positive karma; however, it is not recommended. Buddhism flourished in different countries, and some of those countries have polytheistic folk religions. Buddhism syncretizes easily with other religions. Thus, Buddhism has mixed with the folk religions and emerged in polytheistic variants (such as Vajrayana) as well as non-theistic variants. For example, in Japan, Buddhism, mixed with Shinto, which worships deities called kami, created a tradition which prays to the deities of Shinto as forms of Buddhas. Thus, there may be elements of worship of gods in some forms of later Buddhism. The concepts of Adi-Buddha and Dharmakaya are the closest to monotheism any form of Buddhism comes, all famous sages and Bodhisattvas being regarded as reflections of it. Adi-Buddha is not said to be the creator, but the originator of all things, being a deity in an Emanationist sense. Christianity Although Christianity is officially considered a monotheistic religion, it is sometimes claimed that Christianity is not truly monotheistic because of its teaching about the Trinity,Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church (1974) art. \\"Monotheism\\" which believes in a God revealed in three different persons, namely the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. This is the position of some Jews and Muslims who contend that because of the adoption of a Triune conception of deity, Christianity is actually a form of Tritheism or Polytheism, for example see Shituf or Tawhid. However, the central doctrine of Christianity is that \\"one God exists in Three Persons and One Substance\\".Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church (1974) art. \\"Trinity, Doctrine of the\\" Strictly speaking, the doctrine is a revealed mystery which while above reason is not contrary to it. The word 'person' is an imperfect translation of the original term \\"hypostasis\\". In everyday speech \\"person\\" denotes a separate rational and moral individual, possessed of self- consciousness, and aware of individual identity despite changes. A human person is a distinct individual essence in whom human nature is individualized. But in God there are no three individuals alongside of, and separate from, one another, but only personal self distinctions within the divine essence, which is not only generically, but also numerically, one.Berkhof, Louis. Systematic Theology (1949) page 87 Although the doctrine of the Trinity was not definitely formulated before the First Council of Constantinople in 381, the doctrine of one God, inherited from Judaism was always the indubitable premise of the Church's faith.Kelly, J.N.D. Early Christian Doctrines A&C; Black (1965) pp. 87,88 Jordan Paper, a Western scholar and self-described polytheist, considers polytheism to be the normal state in human culture. He argues that \\"Even the Catholic Church shows polytheistic aspects with the 'worshipping' of the saints.\\" On the other hand, he complains, monotheistic missionaries and scholars were eager to see a proto-monotheism or at least henotheism in polytheistic religions, for example, when taking from the Chinese pair of Sky and Earth only one part and calling it the King of Heaven, as Matteo Ricci did.Jordan Paper: The Deities are Many. A Polytheistic Theology. Albany: State University of New York Press, 2005, pp. 112 and 133. =Mormonism= Joseph Smith, the founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, believed in \\"the plurality of Gods\\", saying \\"I have always declared God to be a distinct personage, Jesus Christ a separate and distinct personage from God the Father, and that the Holy Ghost was a distinct personage and a Spirit: and these three constitute three distinct personages and three Gods\\". Mormonism also affirms the existence of a Heavenly Mother, as well as exaltation, the idea that people can become like god in the afterlife, and the prevailing view among Mormons is that God the Father was once a man who lived on a planet with his own higher God, and who became perfect after following this higher God.. Some critics of Mormonism argue that statements in the Book of Mormon describe a trinitarian conception of God (e.g. ; ), but were superseded by later revelations. Mormons teach that scriptural statements on the unity of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost represent a oneness of purpose, not of substance. They believe that the early Christian church did not characterize divinity in terms of an immaterial, formless shared substance until post-apostolic theologians began to incorporate Greek metaphysical philosophies (such as Neoplatonism) into Christian doctrine. Mormons believe that the truth about God's nature was restored through modern day revelation, which reinstated the original Judeo-Christian concept of a natural, corporeal, immortal God, who is the literal Father of the spirits of humans. It is to this personage alone that Mormons pray, as He is and always will be their Heavenly Father, the supreme \\"God of gods\\" (Deuteronomy 10:17). In the sense that Mormons worship only God the Father, they consider themselves monotheists. Nevertheless, Mormons adhere to Christ's teaching that those who receive God's word can obtain the title of \\"gods\\" (John 10:33‚Äì36), because as literal children of God they can take upon themselves His divine attributes. Mormons teach that \\"The glory of God is intelligence\\" (Doctrine and Covenants 93:36), and that it is by sharing the Father's perfect comprehension of all things that both Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit are also divine. Hinduism Hinduism is not a monolithic religion: many extremely varied religious traditions and practices are grouped together under this umbrella term and some modern scholars have questioned the legitimacy of unifying them artificially and suggest that one should speak of \\"Hinduisms\\" in the plural.Smith, Brian. \\"Hinduism.\\" New Dictionary of the History of Ideas. 2005. Retrieved May 22, 2013 from Encyclopedia.com: http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3424300342.html Theistic Hinduism encompasses both monotheistic and polytheistic tendencies and variations on or mixes of both structures. Hindus venerate deities in the form of the murti, or idol. The Puja (worship) of the murti is like a way to communicate with the formless, abstract divinity (Brahman in Hinduism) which creates, sustains and dissolves creation. However, there are sects who have advocated that there is no need of giving a shape to God and it is omnipresent and beyond the things which human can see or feel tangibly. Specially the Arya Samaj founded by Swami Dayananda Saraswati and Brahmo Samaj founder by Ram Mohan Roy (there are others also) do not worship deities. Arya Samaj favours Vedic chants and Havan, while Brahmo Samaj stresses simple prayers. Some Hindu philosophers and theologians argue for a transcendent metaphysical structure with a single divine essence. This divine essence is usually referred to as Brahman or Atman, but the understanding of the nature of this absolute divine essence is the line which defines many Hindu philosophical traditions such as Vedanta. Among lay Hindus, some believe in different deities emanating from Brahman, while others practice more traditional polytheism and henotheism, focusing their worship on one or more personal deities, while granting the existence of others. Academically speaking, the ancient Vedic scriptures, upon which Hinduism is derived, describe four authorized disciplic lines of teaching coming down over thousands of years. (Padma Purana). Four of them propound that the Absolute Truth is Fully Personal, as in Judeo-Christian theology. That the Primal Original God is Personal, both transcendent and immanent throughout creation. He can be, and is often approached through worship of Murtis, called \\"Archa-Vigraha\\", which are described in the Vedas as likenesses of His various dynamic, spiritual Forms. This is the Vaisnava theology. The fifth disciplic line of Vedic spirituality, founded by Adi Shankaracharya, promotes the concept that the Absolute is Brahman, without clear differentiations, without will, without thought, without intelligence. In the Smarta denomination of Hinduism, the philosophy of Advaita expounded by Shankara allows veneration of numerous deities with the understanding that all of them are but manifestations of one impersonal divine power, Brahman. Therefore, according to various schools of Vedanta including Shankara, which is the most influential and important Hindu theological tradition, there are a great number of deities in Hinduism, such as Vishnu, Shiva, Ganesha, Hanuman, Lakshmi, and Kali, but they are essentially different forms of the same \\"Being\\". However, many Vedantic philosophers also argue that all individuals were united by the same impersonal, divine power in the form of the Atman. Many other Hindus, however, view polytheism as far preferable to monotheism. Ram Swarup, for example, points to the Vedas as being specifically polytheistic, and states that, \\"only some form of polytheism alone can do justice to this variety and richness.\\" Sita Ram Goel, another 20th-century Hindu historian, wrote: Some Hindus construe this notion of polytheism in the sense of polymorphism‚Äîone God with many forms or names. The Rig Veda, the primary Hindu scripture, elucidates this as follows: > They call him Indra, Mitra, Varuna, Agni, and he is heavenly nobly-winged > Garutman. To what is One, sages give many a title they call it Agni, Yama, > Matarisvan. Book I, Hymn 164, Verse 46 Rigveda Neopaganism Neopaganism, also known as modern paganism and contemporary paganism, is a group of contemporary religious movements influenced by or claiming to be derived from the various historical pagan beliefs of pre-modern Europe. Although they do share commonalities, contemporary Pagan religious movements are diverse and no single set of beliefs, practices, or texts are shared by them all. English occultist Dion Fortune was a major populiser of soft polytheism. In her novel, The Sea Priestess, she wrote, \\"All gods are one god, and all goddesses are one goddess, and there is one initiator.\\" =Reconstructionism= Reconstructionist polytheists apply scholarly disciplines such as history, archaeology and language study to revive ancient, traditional religions that have been fragmented, damaged or even destroyed, such as Norse Paganism, Greek Paganism, Celtic polytheism and others. A reconstructionist endeavours to revive and reconstruct an authentic practice, based on the ways of the ancestors but workable in contemporary life. These polytheists sharply differ from neopagans in that they consider their religion not only inspired by the religions of antiquity but often as an actual continuation or revival of those religions. =Wicca= Wicca is a duotheistic faith created by Gerald Gardner that allows for polytheism. Wiccans specifically worship the Lord and Lady of the Isles (their names are oathbound). It is an orthopraxic mystery religion that requires initiation to the priesthood in order to consider oneself Wiccan. Wicca emphasizes duality and the cycle of nature. Serer In Africa, polytheism in Serer religion dates as far back to the Neolithic Era (possibly earlier) when the ancient ancestors of the Serer people represented their Pangool on the Tassili n'Ajjer. Gravrand, Henry, \\"La civilisation Sereer ‚Äì Pangool\\", Les Nouvelles Editions Africaines du Senegal, (1990), . pp 9, 20, 77 The supreme creator deity in Serer religion is Roog. However, there are many deities Kellog, Day Otis, and Smith, William Robertson, \\"The Encyclop√¶dia Britannica: latest edition. A dictionary of arts, sciences and general literature\\", Volume 25, p 64, Werner (1902) and Pangool (singular : Fangool, the interceders with the divine) in Serer religion. Each one has its own purpose and serves as Roog's agent on Earth. Amongst the Cangin speakers, a sub-group of the Serers, Roog is known as Koox. Ndiaye, Ousmane S√©mou, \\"Diversit√© et unicit√© s√©r√®res : l‚Äôexemple de la r√©gion de Thi√®s\\", √âthiopiques, no. 54, vol. 7, 2e semestre 1991 Use as a term of abuse The term 'polytheist' is sometimes used by Sunni Muslim extremist groups such as Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) as a derogatory reference to Shiite Muslims, whom they view as having \\"strayed from Islam‚Äôs monotheistic creed because of the reverence they show for historical figures, like Imam Ali\\". Polydeism Polydeism (from the Greek œÄŒøŒªœç poly (\\"many\\") and Latin deus meaning god) is a portmanteau referencing a polytheistic form of deism, encompassing the belief that the universe was the collective creation of multiple gods, each of whom created a piece of the universe or multiverse and then ceased to intervene in its evolution. This concept addresses an apparent contradiction in deism, that a monotheistic God created the universe, but now expresses no apparent interest in it, by supposing that if the universe is the construct of many gods, none of them would have an interest in the universe as a whole. Creighton University Philosophy professor William O. Stephens,Article on \\"Bill\\" Stephens who has taught this concept, suggests that C. D. Broad projected this conceptarticle on C. D. Broad's concept projection in Broad's 1925 article, \\"The Validity of Belief in a Personal God\\".C. D. Broad, \\"The Validity of Belief in a Personal God\\", reprinted in C. D. Broad, Religion, Philosophy and Psychical Research, (1953), 159‚Äì174. Broad noted that the arguments for the existence of God only tend to prove that \\"a designing mind had existed in the past, not that it does exist now. It is quite compatible with this argument that God should have died long ago, or that he should have turned his attention to other parts of the Universe\\", and notes in the same breath that \\"there is nothing in the facts to suggest that there is only one such being\\".Id. at 171. Stephens contends that Broad, in turn, derived the concept from David Hume. Stephens states: This use of the term appears to originate at least as early as Robert M. Bowman Jr.'s 1997 essay, Apologetics from Genesis to Revelation. Bowman wrote: Sociologist Susan Starr Sered used the term in her 1994 book, Priestess, Mother, Sacred Sister: Religions Dominated by Women, which includes a chapter titled, \\"No Father in Heaven: Androgyny and Polydeism\\". Sered states therein that she has \\"chosen to gloss on 'polydeism' a range of beliefs in more than one supernatural entity.\\"Susan Starr Sered, Priestess, Mother, Sacred Sister: Religions Dominated by Women (1994), p. 169. Sered used this term in a way that would encompass polytheism, rather than exclude much of it, as she intended to capture both polytheistic systems and nontheistic systems that assert the influence of \\"spirits or ancestors\\". This use of the term, however, does not accord with the historical misuse of deism as a concept to describe an absent creator god.

The station closed with the rest of the Green Line on January 9, 1994, to be rebuilt, but did not reopen with the rest of the Green Line on May 12, 1996, because of its close proximity to the Garfield station. History 58th opened on January 22, 1893, when the South Side Elevated Railroad expanded southward to serve the World's Columbian Exposition in Jackson Park. The station was designed by Myron H. Church and built by the Rapid Transit and Bridge Construction Company, and it included elements of the Queen Anne style as well as the Chicago school. The original station house was brick and had a half-cone bay at the top of the building. 58th was built with an island platform, an anomaly among the South Side Elevated stations which generally had two side platforms.Chicago \\"L\\".org - 58th The original canopy was hump- shaped; this style was common among South Side Elevated stations at the time, but the canopy at 58th outlasted most of the original canopies at other stations. When the Englewood Branch became part of the South Side Elevated in 1905, 58th became the transfer station between the Englewood and Jackson Park branches. At the start of the branch's operation, the South Side Elevated ran shuttle trains from 58th to the end of the branch, and passengers had to take Jackson Park trains from 58th. Express service from Englewood to downtown was established in 1906, and the shuttle to 58th was discontinued in 1911. 58th remained the transfer station between the two branches until A/B skip stop service went into effect in 1949. The station then became an \\"A\\" station and only served Englewood trains, and 51st became the transfer station between the two branches. 58th shortly became the transfer point again in 1993 when the CTA discontinued skip-stop service. The CTA began to rebuild 58th in 1983. The platform was rebuilt first, and the original canopy was replaced with a new canopy which extended over the rails. The station house was scheduled to be rebuilt in 1986; it was paid for by a separate project because of the CTA's lack of funds for renovation. However, the project was delayed until 1988. The original station house was then removed, but a new station house was never built, and temporary turnstiles were installed on the platform. Closure and demolition Platform of 58th Station On January 9, 1994, 58th closed along with the other Green Line stations so the line could be rebuilt. However, 58th did not reopen with the rest of the Green Line on May 12, 1996, because of its close proximity to Garfield and the CTA's desire to cut operating costs after the renovation. The station remained abandoned, but the platform and stairs remained for 18 years after closure. Because federal funds were used in the station's renovation, the CTA was required to keep 58th in operable condition and could not demolish what remained of the station until the federal grant amount had amortized. By 2010, however, the platform decking had deteriorated to the point that it could no longer be used even by CTA personnel. As a result, the CTA demolished what remained of the station between late January and early February 2012. Since then, the only remnants of the station are the wide extra space between the two Green Line tracks, as well as the elevated structure around the station site.

Alexandra Victoria's father was the eldest son of Friedrich, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl√ºcksburg and a nephew of Christian IX of Denmark. He had succeeded to the headship of the House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl√ºcksburg and the title of duke upon the death of his father on 27 November 1885. Marriages and issue Prince August Wilhelm Alexandra Victoria's first husband, Prince August Wilhelm of Prussia.Alexandra Victoria's first husband was her first cousin Prince August Wilhelm of Prussia, the son of Wilhelm II, German Emperor and his wife Augusta Viktoria, a sister of Alexandra Victoria's mother. They married on 22 October 1908 at the Berliner Stadtschloss. The marriage was arranged by the Emperor and Empress, but it was relatively happy. Alexandra was a great favorite of her mother-in-law, especially since the Empress was also her own aunt.Radziwill, p. 38. A contemporary of the court, Princess Catherine Radziwill, commented that Alexandra \\"had always shown herself willing to listen to her mother-in-law. She is a nice girl - fair, fat, and a perfect type of the 'Deutsche Hausfrau' dear to the souls of German novel- writers\\".Radziwill, pp. 38-39. Another contemporary wrote that the marriage had been a love match, and that Alexandra was a \\"charmingly pretty, bright girl\\".Schwering, p. 92. The couple had planned to take up residence in Sch√∂nhausen Palace in Berlin, but changed their mind when August Wilhelm's father decided to leave his son the Villa Liegnitz in the Sanssouci Park in Potsdam. Their residence developed into a meeting place for artists and scholars. Alexandra Victoria and August Wilhelm had one son: *Prince Alexander Ferdinand of Prussia (26 December 1912 - 12 June 1985) During the First World War, August Wilhelm was made district administrator (Landrat) of the district of Ruppin; his office and residence was now Schloss Rheinsberg. His personal adjutant Hans Georg von Mackensen, with whom he had been close friends since his youth, played an important role in his life. These \\"pronounced homophilic tendencies\\" contributed to the failure of his marriage to Princess Alexandra Victoria. They never undertook a formal divorce due to the opposition of August Wilhelm's father, Kaiser Wilhelm II. After the fall of the German monarchy in 1918, the couple divorced on 16 March 1920.

Dorothy Allred was born to Mormon fundamentalist leader Rulon C. Allred and his fourth plural wife. She was the 28th of her father's 48 children. In 1977, her father was murdered by agents of rival polygamist leader Ervil LeBaron. In her memoirs, Allred is open about and critical of the many problems posed by polygamy as practiced by fundamentalist Mormon sects. These problems include the secrecy that necessitated lying to friends and neighbors about their father, constant poverty, jealousy among wives and siblings, an inability to have an emotionally healthy father-child relationship, severe sexual repression, violent schisms both from internal and external rivals to leadership, and other issues rarely encountered in monogamy. In the same memoirs she makes very clear that she had great love and respect for her father, a complex man who was as honorable as his patriarchal position allowed and whose sincerity of belief she never doubted. As an adult, Dorothy Allred broke with her father's group, the Apostolic United Brethren, and became a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), which officially renounced polygamy in 1890. She entered into a monogamous marriage and was educated at the University of Utah. Unlike the experience of many apostates from polygamous communities and sects, she did continue a relationship with her parents and many members of her extended family, who continued to accept her as their daughter in spite of their disapproval of her membership in the LDS Church. Solomon is the author of five books, including three that describe aspects of her life growing up in fundamentalist Mormon polygamy. She is active in Utah's movement to educate people about polygamy and has been a guest on The Oprah Winfrey Show, the Today Show, Larry King Live, Hannity & Colmes, and other talk and news programs. She has also written a screenplay based upon her childhood. Solomon lives with her husband and family in Saint George, Utah. Publications * (1984).

Kiple, A Movable Feast: Ten Millennia of Food Globalization (2007), p. 22. Bird and reptile eggs consist of a protective eggshell, albumen (egg white), and vitellus (egg yolk), contained within various thin membranes. The most commonly consumed eggs are chicken eggs. Other poultry eggs including those of duck and quail also are eaten. Fish eggs are called roe and caviar. Egg yolks and whole eggs store significant amounts of protein and choline, and are widely used in cookery. Due to their protein content, the United States Department of Agriculture formerly categorized eggs as Meats within the Food Guide Pyramid (now MyPlate). Despite the nutritional value of eggs, there are some potential health issues arising from cholesterol content, salmonella contamination, and allergy to egg proteins. Chickens and other egg-laying creatures are kept widely throughout the world and mass production of chicken eggs is a global industry. In 2009, an estimated 62.1 million metric tons of eggs were produced worldwide from a total laying flock of approximately 6.4 billion hens.Outlook for egg production WATT Ag Net ‚Äì Watt Publishing Co There are issues of regional variation in demand and expectation, as well as current debates concerning methods of mass production. In 2012, the European Union banned battery husbandry of chickens.  History  Scrambled eggs Bird eggs have been valuable foodstuffs since prehistory, in both hunting societies and more recent cultures where birds were domesticated. The chicken probably was domesticated for its eggs (from jungle fowl native to tropical and subtropical Southeast Asia and Indian subcontinent) before 7500 BCE. Chickens were brought to Sumer and Egypt by 1500 BCE, and arrived in Greece around 800 BCE, where the quail had been the primary source of eggs. In Thebes, Egypt, the tomb of Haremhab, dating to approximately 1420 BCE, shows a depiction of a man carrying bowls of ostrich eggs and other large eggs, presumably those of the pelican, as offerings. In ancient Rome, eggs were preserved using a number of methods and meals often started with an egg course. The Romans crushed the shells in their plates to prevent evil spirits from hiding there. In the Middle Ages, eggs were forbidden during Lent because of their richness. Egg scrambled with acidic fruit juices were popular in France in the seventeenth century; this may have been the origin of lemon curd. The dried egg industry developed in the nineteenth century, before the rise of the frozen egg industry. In 1878, a company in St. Louis, Missouri started to transform egg yolk and egg white into a light-brown, meal-like substance by using a drying process. The production of dried eggs significantly expanded during World War II, for use by the United States Armed Forces and its allies. In 1911, the egg carton was invented by Joseph Coyle in Smithers, British Columbia, to solve a dispute about broken eggs between a farmer in Bulkley Valley and the owner of the Aldermere Hotel. Early egg cartons were made of paper.  Varieties  Quail eggs (upper left), chicken egg (lower left), and ostrich egg (right). Collected chicken eggs and quail eggs in a wicker basket. Bird eggs are a common food and one of the most versatile ingredients used in cooking. They are important in many branches of the modern food industry. The most commonly used bird eggs are those from the chicken, duck, and goose eggs. Smaller eggs, such as quail eggs, are used occasionally as a gourmet ingredient in Western countries. Eggs are a common everyday food in many parts of Asia, such as China and Thailand, with Asian production providing 59 percent of the world total in 2013. The largest bird eggs, from ostriches, tend to be used only as special luxury food. Gull eggs are considered a delicacy in England, as well as in some Scandinavian countries, particularly in Norway. In some African countries, guineafowl eggs often are seen in marketplaces, especially in the spring of each year. Pheasant eggs and emu eggs are edible, but less widely available; sometimes they are obtainable from farmers, poulterers, or luxury grocery stores. In many countries, wild bird eggs are protected by laws which prohibit the collecting or selling of them, or permit collection only during specific periods of the year.  Production  In 2017, world production of chicken eggs was 80.1 million tonnes. The largest producers were China with 31.3 million of this total, the United States with 6.3 million, India at 4.8 million, Mexico at 2.8 million, Japan at 2.6 million, and Brazil and Russia with 2.5 million each. A typical large egg factory ships a million dozen eggs per week. For the month of January 2019, the United States produced 9.41 billion eggs, with 8.2 billion for table consumption and 1.2 billion for raising chicks. Americans are projected to each consume 279 eggs in 2019, the highest since 1973, but less than the 405 eggs eaten per person in 1945. During production, eggs usually are candled to check their quality. The size of its air cell is determined, and the examination also reveals whether the egg was fertilized and thereby contains an embryo. Depending on local regulations, eggs may be washed before being placed in egg boxes, although washing may shorten their length of freshness.

Cuticula The shape of an egg resembles a prolate spheroid with one end larger than the other and has cylindrical symmetry along the long axis. An egg is surrounded by a thin, hard shell. Thin membranes exist inside the shell. The egg yolk is suspended in the egg white by one or two spiral bands of tissue called the chalazae (from the Greek word œáŒ¨ŒªŒ±Œ∂Œ±, meaning 'hailstone' or 'hard lump').  Air cell  The larger end of the egg contains an air cell that forms when the contents of the egg cool down and contract after it is laid. Chicken eggs are graded according to the size of this air cell, measured during candling. A very fresh egg has a small air cell and receives a grade of AA. As the size of the air cell increases and the quality of the egg decreases, the grade moves from AA to A to B. This provides a way of testing the age of an egg: as the air cell increases in size due to air being drawn through pores in the shell as water is lost, the egg becomes less dense and the larger end of the egg will rise to increasingly shallower depths when the egg is placed in a bowl of water. A very old egg will float in the water and should not be eaten.  Shell  Eggshell color is caused by pigment deposition during egg formation in the oviduct and may vary according to species and breed, from the more common white or brown to pink or speckled blue-green. Generally, chicken breeds with white ear lobes lay white eggs, whereas chickens with red ear lobes lay brown eggs. Although there is no significant link between shell color and nutritional value, often there is a cultural preference for one color over another (see 'Color of eggshell', below). Brown eggs have significantly higher incidence of blood spots due to candling being less effective.  Membrane  The eggshell membrane is a clear film lining the eggshell, visible when one peels a boiled egg. Primarily, it composed of fibrous proteins such as collagen type I. These membranes may be used commercially as a dietary supplement.  White  \\"White\\" is the common name for the clear liquid (also called the albumen or the glair/glaire) contained within an egg. Colorless and transparent initially, upon cooking it turns white and opaque. In chickens, it is formed from the layers of secretions of the anterior section of the hen oviduct during the passage of the egg.Ornithology, Volume 1994 By Frank B. Gill p. 361 It forms around both fertilized and unfertilized yolks. The primary natural purpose of egg white is to protect the yolk and provide additional nutrition during the growth of the embryo. Egg white consists primarily of approximately 90 percent water into which is dissolved 10 percent proteins (including albumins, mucoproteins, and globulins). Unlike the yolk, which is high in lipids (fats), egg white contains almost no fat and the carbohydrate content is less than one percent. Egg white has many uses in food and many other applications, including the preparation of vaccines, such as those for influenza.  Yolk  The yolk in a newly laid egg is round and firm. As the yolk ages, it absorbs water from the albumen, which increases its size and causes it to stretch and weaken the vitelline membrane (the clear casing enclosing the yolk). The resulting effect is a flattened and enlarged yolk shape. Yolk color is dependent on the diet of the hen. If the diet contains yellow or orange plant pigments known as xanthophylls, then they are deposited in the yolk, coloring it. Lutein is the most abundant pigment in egg yolk.F. Karadas et al., Effects of carotenoids from lucerne, marigold and tomato on egg yolk pigmentation and carotenoid composition. Br Poult Sci. 2006 Oct;47(5):561-6. A diet without such colorful foods may result in an almost colorless yolk. Yolk color is, for example, enhanced if the diet includes foods such as yellow corn and marigold petals.Shell eggs from farm to table . USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service, (2011). In the US, the use of artificial color additives is forbidden.  Abnormalities  Abnormalities that have been found in eggs purchased for human consumption include: * Double-yolk eggs, when an egg contains two or more yolks, occurs when ovulation occurs too rapidly, or when one yolk becomes joined with another yolk. * Yolkless eggs, which contain whites but no yolk, usually occurs during a pullet's first effort, produced before her laying mechanism is fully ready. * Double-shelled eggs, where an egg may have two or more outer shells, is caused by a counter-peristalsis contraction and occurs when a second oocyte is released by the ovary before the first egg has completely traveled through the oviduct and been laid. * Shell-less or thin-shelled eggs may be caused by egg drop syndrome.  Culinary properties   Types of dishes  sunny side up Soft-boiled quail eggs with potato galettes Chicken eggs are widely used in many types of dishes, both sweet and savory, including many baked goods. Some of the most common preparation methods include scrambled, fried, poached, hard-boiled, soft-boiled, omelettes, and pickled. They also may be eaten raw, although this is not recommended for people who may be especially susceptible to salmonellosis, such as the elderly, the infirm, or pregnant women. In addition, the protein in raw eggs is only 51 percent bioavailable, whereas that of a cooked egg is nearer 91 percent bioavailable, meaning the protein of cooked eggs is nearly twice as absorbable as the protein from raw eggs. As a cooking ingredient, egg yolks are an important emulsifier in the kitchen, and are also used as a thickener, as in custards. The albumen (egg white) contains protein, but little or no fat, and may be used in cooking separately from the yolk. The proteins in egg white allow it to form foams and aerated dishes. Egg whites may be aerated or whipped to a light, fluffy consistency, and often are used in desserts such as meringues and mousse. Ground eggshells sometimes are used as a food additive to deliver calcium. Every part of an egg is edible, although the eggshell is generally discarded. Some recipes call for immature or unlaid eggs, which are harvested after the hen is slaughtered or cooked, while still inside the chicken.Marian Burros, \\"What the Egg Was First\\", The New York Times, 7 February 2007  Cooking  Half fried egg dish. Eggs contain multiple proteins that gel at different temperatures within the yolk and the white, and the temperature determines the gelling time. Egg yolk becomes a gel, or solidifies, between . Egg white gels at different temperatures: . The white contains exterior albumen which sets at the highest temperature. In practice, in many cooking processes the white gels first because it is exposed to higher temperatures for longer. Salmonella is killed instantly at , but also is killed from , if held at that temperature for sufficiently long time periods. To avoid the issue of salmonella, eggs may be pasteurized in-shell at for an hour and 15 minutes. Although the white then is slightly milkier, the eggs may be used in normal ways. Whipping for meringue takes significantly longer, but the final volume is virtually the same. If a boiled egg is overcooked, a greenish ring sometimes appears around egg yolk due to changes to the iron and sulfur compounds in the egg. It also may occur with an abundance of iron in the cooking water. Overcooking harms the quality of the protein. Chilling an overcooked egg for a few minutes in cold water until it is completely cooled may prevent the greenish ring from forming on the surface of the yolk. Peeling a cooked egg is easiest when the egg was put into boiling water as opposed to slowly heating the egg from a start in cold water.This was shown experimentally and documented in the book The Food Lab: Better Home Cooking Through Science by J. Kenji L√≥pez-Alt; published 21 September 2015 by W. W. Norton & Company,  Flavor variations  A batch of tea eggs with shell intact soaking in a brew of spices and tea. Although the age of the egg and the conditions of its storage have a greater influence, the bird's diet affects the flavor of the egg. For example, when a brown-egg chicken breed eats rapeseed (canola) or soy meals, its intestinal microbes metabolize them into fishy-smelling triethylamine, which ends up in the egg. The unpredictable diet of free-range hens will produce likewise, unpredictable egg flavors. Duck eggs tend to have a flavor distinct from, but still resembling, chicken eggs. Eggs may be soaked in mixtures to absorb flavor. Tea eggs, a common snack sold from street-side carts in China, are steeped in a brew from a mixture of various spices, soy sauce, and black tea leaves to give flavor.  Storage  Careful storage of edible eggs is extremely important, as an improperly handled egg may contain elevated levels of Salmonella bacteria that may cause severe food poisoning. In the US, eggs are washed. This cleans the shell, but erodes its cuticle. The USDA thus recommends refrigerating eggs to prevent the growth of Salmonella. Refrigeration also preserves the taste and texture, however, intact eggs (unwashed and unbroken) may be left unrefrigerated for several months without spoiling.How to Store Fresh Eggs Mother Earth News, November/December (1977) In Europe, eggs are not usually washed, and the shells are dirtier, however the cuticle is undamaged, and they do not require refrigeration. In the UK in particular, hens are immunized against salmonella and generally, their eggs are safe for 21 days.  Preservation  Salted duck egg. The simplest method to preserve an egg is to treat it with salt. Salt draws water out of bacteria and molds, which prevents their growth. The Chinese salted duck egg is made by immersing duck eggs in brine, or coating them individually with a paste of salt and mud or clay. The eggs stop absorbing salt after approximately a month, having reached osmotic equilibrium. Their yolks take on an orange-red color and solidify, but the white remains somewhat liquid. These often are boiled before consumption and are served with rice congee. Pickled egg, colored with beetroot juice. Another method is to make pickled eggs, by boiling them first and immersing them in a mixture of vinegar, salt, and spices, such as ginger or allspice. Frequently, beetroot juice is added to impart a red color to the eggs. If the eggs are immersed in it for a few hours, the distinct red, white, and yellow colors may be seen when the eggs are sliced. If marinated for several days or more, the red color will reach the yolk. If the eggs are marinated in the mixture for several weeks or more, the vinegar will dissolve much of the shell's calcium carbonate and penetrate the egg, making it acidic enough to inhibit the growth of bacteria and molds. Pickled eggs made this way generally keep for a year or more without refrigeration. Century egg. A century egg or hundred-year-old egg is preserved by coating an egg in a mixture of clay, wood ash, salt, lime, and rice straw for several weeks to several months, depending on the method of processing. After the process is completed, the yolk becomes a dark green, cream-like substance with a strong odor of sulfur and ammonia, while the white becomes a dark brown, transparent jelly with a comparatively mild, distinct flavor. The transforming agent in a century egg is its alkaline material, which gradually raises the pH of the egg from approximately 9 to 12 or more. This chemical process breaks down some of the complex, flavorless proteins and fats of the yolk into simpler, flavorful ones, which in some way may be thought of as an \\"inorganic\\" version of fermentation.  Cooking substitutes  For those who do not consume eggs, alternatives used in baking include other rising agents or binding materials, such as ground flax seeds or potato starch flour. Tofu also acts as a partial binding agent, since it is high in lecithin due to its soy content. Applesauce may be used, as well as arrowroot and banana. Extracted soybean lecithin, in turn, often is used in packaged foods as an inexpensive substitute for egg-derived lecithin. Leguminous broths, such as chickpea brine or green pea canning liquid, also known as aquafaba, can replace egg whites in desserts such as meringues and mousses. Other egg substitutes are made from just the white of the egg for those who worry about the high cholesterol and fat content in eggs. These products usually have added vitamins and minerals, as well as vegetable-based emulsifiers and thickeners, such as xanthan gum or guar gum. These allow the product to maintain the nutrition and several culinary properties of real eggs, making possible foods such as Hollandaise sauce, custard, mayonnaise, and most baked goods with these substitutes.  Nutrition   Egg sizes   Nutritional value  A medium/large chicken egg provides approximately of food energy and 6 g of protein.\\"Full Report (All Nutrients): 01129, Egg, whole, cooked, hard-boiled\\", USDA Branded Food Products Database\\"Full Report (All Nutrients): 45174951, EGGS\\", USDA Branded Food Products Database Eggs (boiled) supply several vitamins and minerals as significant amounts of the Daily Value (DV), including vitamin A (19 percent DV), riboflavin (42 percent DV), pantothenic acid (28 percent DV), vitamin B12 (46 percent DV), choline (60 percent DV), phosphorus (25 percent DV), zinc (11 percent DV) and vitamin D (15 percent DV). Cooking methods affect the nutritional values of eggs. A yolk contains more than two-thirds of the recommended daily intake of 300 mg of cholesterol. The diet of laying hens also may affect the nutritional quality of eggs. For instance, chicken eggs that are especially high in omega-3 fatty acids are produced by feeding hens a diet containing polyunsaturated fats from sources such as fish oil, chia seeds, or flaxseeds. Pasture-raised free-range hens, which forage for their own food, also produce eggs that are relatively enriched in omega-3 fatty acids when compared to those of cage-raised chickens. A 2010 USDA study determined there were no significant differences of macronutrients in various chicken eggs. Cooked eggs are easier to digest than raw eggs, as well as having a lower risk of salmonellosis.  Health effects   Cholesterol and fat  More than half the calories found in eggs come from the fat in the yolk; 50 grams of chicken egg (the contents of an egg just large enough to be classified as \\"large\\" in the US, but \\"medium\\" in Europe) contains approximately five grams of fat. People on a low-cholesterol diet may need to reduce egg consumption; however, only 27 percent of the fat in egg is saturated fat (palmitic, stearic, and myristic acids).U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service. 2007. USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference, Release 20. Nutrient Data Laboratory Home Page The egg white consists primarily of water (87 percent) and protein (13 percent) and contains no cholesterol and little, if any, fat. There is debate over whether egg yolk presents a health risk. Some research suggests dietary cholesterol increases the ratio of total to HDL cholesterol and, therefore, adversely affects the body's cholesterol profile; whereas other studies show that moderate consumption of eggs, up to one a day, does not appear to increase heart disease risk in healthy individuals. Harold McGee argues that the cholesterol in the egg yolk is not what causes a problem, because fat (particularly saturated fat) is much more likely to raise cholesterol levels than the consumption of cholesterol.  Type 2 diabetes  Studies have shown conflicting results about a possible connection between egg consumption and type 2 diabetes. A 1999 prospective study of more than 117,000 people by the Harvard School of Public Health concluded in part, that \\"The apparent increased risk of CHD associated with higher egg consumption among diabetic participants warrants further research.\\" A 2008 study by the Physicians' Health Study I (1982‚Äì2007) and the Women's Health Study (1992‚Äì2007) determined the \\"data suggest that high levels of egg consumption (daily) are associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes\\", however, a study published in 2010 found no link between egg consumption and type 2 diabetes. A meta-analysis from 2013 found that eating four eggs per week was associated with a 29 percent increase in the relative risk of developing diabetes. Another meta-analysis from 2013 also supported the idea that egg consumption may lead to an increased incidence of type two diabetes. A 2020 meta-analysis found that there was no overall association between moderate egg consumption and risk of type 2 diabetes.  Cardiovascular risk  Eggs are one of the largest sources of phosphatidylcholine (lecithin) in the human diet. A study published in the scientific journal, Nature, showed that dietary phosphatidylcholine is digested by bacteria in the gut and eventually converted into the compound TMAO, a compound linked with increased heart disease. A 1999 Harvard School of Public Health study of 37,851 men and 80,082 women concluded that its \\"findings suggest that consumption of up to 1 egg per day is unlikely to have substantial overall impact on the risk of CHD or stroke among healthy men and women.\\" In a study of 4,000 people, scientists found that eating eggs increased blood levels of a metabolite promoting atherosclerosis, TMAO, and that this in turn caused significantly higher risk of heart attack and stroke after three years of follow-up. A 2007 study of nearly 10,000 adults demonstrated no correlation between moderate (six per week) egg consumption and cardiovascular disease or strokes, except in the subpopulation of diabetic patients who also presented an increased risk of coronary artery disease. One potential alternative explanation for the null finding is that background dietary cholesterol may be so high in the usual Western diet that adding somewhat more has little further effect on blood cholesterol. Other research supports the idea that a high egg intake increases cardiovascular risk in diabetic patients. A 2009 prospective cohort study of more than 21,000 individuals suggests that \\"egg consumption up to 6 [per] week has no major effect on the risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality and that consumption of [more than 7 a week] is associated with a modest increased risk of total mortality\\" in males, whereas among males with diabetes, \\"any egg consumption is associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality and there was suggestive evidence for an increased risk of myocardial infarction and stroke\\". A 2013 meta-analysis found no association between egg consumption and heart disease or stroke. A 2013 systematic review and meta-analysis found no association between egg consumption and cardiovascular disease or cardiovascular disease mortality, but did find egg consumption of more than once daily increased cardiovascular disease risk 1.69-fold in those with type 2 diabetes mellitus when compared to type 2 diabetics who ate less than one egg per week. Another 2013 meta-analysis found that eating four eggs per week increased the risk of cardiovascular disease by six percent. A 2020 meta- analysis and review found that moderate egg consumption (up to one egg a day) is not associated with cardiovascular disease risk.  Contamination  Egg cleaning on a farm in Norway. A health issue associated with eggs is contamination by pathogenic bacteria, such as Salmonella enteritidis. Contamination of eggs with other members of the genus Salmonella while exiting a female bird via the cloaca may occur, so care must be taken to prevent the egg shell from becoming contaminated with fecal matter. In commercial practice in the US, eggs are quickly washed with a sanitizing solution within minutes of being laid. The risk of infection from raw or undercooked eggs is dependent in part upon the sanitary conditions under which the hens are kept. Health experts advise people to refrigerate washed eggs, use them within two weeks, cook them thoroughly, and never consume raw eggs.\\"Eggs ‚Äì No Yolking Matter .\\" Nutrition Action Health Letter, July/August 1997. As with meat, containers and surfaces that have been used to process raw eggs should not come in contact with ready-to-eat food. A study by the U.S. Department of Agriculture in 2002 (Risk Analysis April 2002 22(2):203-18) suggests the problem is not so prevalent in the U.S. as once thought. It showed that of the 69 billion eggs produced annually, only 2.3 million are contaminated with Salmonella‚Äîequivalent to just one in every 30,000 eggs‚Äîthus showing Salmonella infection is quite rarely induced by eggs. This has not been the case in other countries, however, where Salmonella enteritidis and Salmonella typhimurium infections due to egg consumption are major concerns. Egg shells act as hermetic seals that guard against bacteria entering, but this seal can be broken through improper handling or if laid by unhealthy chickens. Most forms of contamination enter through such weaknesses in the shell. In the UK, the British Egg Industry Council awards the lions stamp to eggs that, among other things, come from hens that have been vaccinated against Salmonella.Knowledge Guide , British Egg Information Service. Retrieved 26 February 2010.Lion Code of Practice. Retrieved 26 February 2010.Farming UK news article. Retrieved 26 February 2010. In 2017, authorities blocked millions of eggs from sale in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany because of contamination with the insecticide fipronil.  Food allergy  One of the most common food allergies in infants is eggs.Egg Allergy Brochure, distributed by Royal Prince Alfred Hospital Infants usually have the opportunity to grow out of this allergy during childhood, if exposure is minimized.\\"Egg Allergy Facts\\" Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America Allergic reactions against egg white are more common than reactions against egg yolks. In addition to true allergic reactions, some people experience a food intolerance to egg whites. Food labeling practices in most developed countries now include eggs, egg products, and the processing of foods on equipment that also process foods containing eggs in a special allergen alert section of the ingredients on the labels.\\"Food allergen labelling and information requirements under the EU Food Information for Consumers Regulation No. 1169/2011: Technical Guidance\\" (April 2015).  Farming  Eggs for sale at a grocery store. White and brown eggs in an egg crate. Most commercially farmed chicken eggs intended for human consumption are unfertilized, since the laying hens are kept without roosters. Fertile eggs may be eaten, with little nutritional difference when compared to the unfertilized. Fertile eggs will not contain a developed embryo, as refrigeration temperatures inhibit cellular growth for an extended period of time. Sometimes an embryo is allowed to develop, but eaten before hatching as with balut.  Grading by quality and size  The U.S. Department of Agriculture grades eggs by the interior quality of the egg (see Haugh unit) and the appearance and condition of the egg shell. Eggs of any quality grade may differ in weight (size). *U.S. Grade AA **Eggs have whites that are thick and firm; have yolks that are high, round, and practically free from defects; and have clean, unbroken shells. **Grade AA and Grade A eggs are best for frying and poaching, where appearance is important. *U.S. Grade A **Eggs have characteristics of Grade AA eggs except the whites are \\"reasonably\\" firm. **This is the quality most often sold in stores. *U.S. Grade B **Eggs have whites that may be thinner and yolks that may be wider and flatter than eggs of higher grades. The shells must be unbroken, but may show slight stains. **This quality is seldom found in retail stores because usually they are used to make liquid, frozen, and dried egg products, as well as other egg- containing products. In Australia and the European Union, eggs are graded by the hen raising method, free range, battery caged, etc. Chicken eggs are graded by size for the purpose of sales. Some maxi eggs may have double-yolks and some farms separate out double-yolk eggs for special sale. File:Egg and maxi egg 1.jpgComparison of an egg and a maxi egg with a double-yolk - Closed (1/2) File:Egg and maxi egg 2.jpgComparison of an egg and a maxi egg with a double-yolk - Opened (2/2) File:Egg with two yellows.jpgDouble-yolk egg - Opened  Color of eggshell  White, speckled (red), and brown chicken eggs. Although eggshell color is a largely cosmetic issue, with no effect on egg quality or taste, it is a major issue in production due to regional and national preferences for specific colors, and the results of such preferences on demand. For example, in most regions of the United States, chicken eggs generally are white. However, brown eggs are more common in some parts of the Northeastern United States, particularly New England, where a television jingle for years proclaimed \\"brown eggs are local eggs, and local eggs are fresh!\\". Local chicken breeds, including the Rhode Island Red, lay brown eggs. Brown eggs are preferred in China, Costa Rica, Ireland, France, and the United Kingdom. In Brazil and Poland, white chicken eggs are generally regarded as industrial, and brown or reddish ones are preferred. Small farms and smallholdings, particularly in economically advanced nations, may sell eggs of widely varying colors and sizes, with combinations of white, brown, speckled (red), green, and blue (as laid by certain breeds, including araucanas,Blue eggs, sometimes thought a joke, are a reality, as reported here , for example. heritage skyline, and cream leg bar) eggs in the same box or carton, while the supermarkets at the same time sell mostly eggs from the larger producers, of the color preferred in that nation or region. Very dark brown eggs of Marans, a French breed of chicken. These cultural trends have been observed for many years. The New York Times reported during the Second World War that housewives in Boston preferred brown eggs and those in New York preferred white eggs.See New York Times historical archive for details ‚Äì link opens on correct page. In February 1976, the New Scientist magazine, in discussing issues of chicken egg color, stated \\"Housewives are particularly fussy about the colour of their eggs, preferring even to pay more for brown eggs although white eggs are just as good\\". As a result of these trends, brown eggs are usually more expensive to purchase in regions where white eggs are considered \\"normal\\", due to lower production.Evidence cited here . In France and the United Kingdom, it is very difficult to buy white eggs, with most supermarkets supplying only the more popular brown eggs. By direct contrast, in Egypt it is very hard to source brown eggs, as demand is almost entirely for white ones, with the country's largest supplier describing white eggs as \\"table eggs\\" and packaging brown eggs for export.El-banna company website, product information, available here . Research conducted by a French institute in the 1970s demonstrated blue chicken eggs from the Chilean araucana fowl may be stronger and more resilient to breakage. Research at Nihon University, Japan in 1990 revealed a number of different issues were important to Japanese housewives when deciding which eggs to buy and that color was a distinct factor, with most Japanese housewives preferring the white color.Results of the study are published here. Egg producers carefully consider cultural issues, as well as commercial ones, when selecting the breed or breeds of chickens used for production, as egg color varies between breeds.Virtually any on-line chicken supply company will state the egg color of each breed supplied. This is one example. Among producers and breeders, brown eggs often are referred to as \\"tinted\\", while the speckled eggs preferred by some consumers often are referred to as being \\"red\\" in color.  Living conditions of birds  Laying hens in battery cages. Commercial factory farming operations often involve raising the hens in small, crowded cages, preventing the chickens from engaging in natural behaviors, such as wing-flapping, dust-bathing, scratching, pecking, perching, and nest-building. Such restrictions may lead to pacing and escape behavior. Many hens confined to battery cages, and some raised in cage-free conditions, are debeaked to prevent them from harming each other and engaging in cannibalism. According to critics of the practice, this can cause hens severe pain to the point where some may refuse to eat and starve to death. Some hens may be forced to molt to increase egg quality and production level after the molting. Molting can be induced by extended food withdrawal, water withdrawal, or controlled lighting programs. Laying hens often are slaughtered when reaching 100 to 130 weeks of age, when their egg productivity starts to decline. Due to modern selective breeding, laying hen strains differ from meat production strains. As male birds of the laying strain do not lay eggs and are not suitable for meat production, they generally are killed soon after they hatch. Free-range eggs are considered by some advocates to be an acceptable substitute to factory-farmed eggs. Free-range laying hens are given outdoor access instead of being contained in crowded cages. Questions regarding the living conditions of free-range hens have been raised in the United States of America, as there is no legal definition or regulations for eggs labeled as free-range in that country. In the United States, increased public concern for animal welfare has pushed various egg producers to promote eggs under a variety of standards. The most widespread standard in use is determined by United Egg Producers through their voluntary program of certification. The United Egg Producers program includes guidelines regarding housing, food, water, air, living space, beak trimming, molting, handling, and transportation, however, opponents such as The Humane Society have alleged UEP certification is misleading and allows a significant amount of unchecked animal cruelty. Other standards include \\"Cage Free\\", \\"Natural\\", \\"Certified Humane\\", and \\"Certified Organic\\". Of these standards, \\"Certified Humane\\", which carries requirements for stocking density and cage-free keeping and so on, and \\"Certified Organic\\", which requires hens to have outdoor access and to be fed only organic vegetarian feed and so on, are the most stringent. Effective 1 January 2012, the European Union banned conventional battery cages for egg-laying hens, as outlined in EU Directive 1999/74/EC. The EU permits the use of \\"enriched\\" furnished cages that must meet certain space and amenity requirements. Egg producers in many member states have objected to the new quality standards while in some countries, even furnished cages and family cages are subject to be banned as well. The production standard of the eggs is visible on a mandatory egg marking categorization where the EU egg code begins with 3 for caged chicken to 1 for free-range eggs and 0 for organic egg production. Killing of male chicks In battery cage and free-range egg production, unwanted male chicks are killed at birth during the process of securing a further generation of egg-laying hens. In Germany in June 2019, a court decided that culling chicks \\"violates the country's laws against killing animals without a justifiable reason\\".  Cultural significance  Han√°ck√© kraslice, Easter eggs from the Han√° region, the Czech Republic. A popular Easter tradition in some parts of the world is a decoration of hard-boiled eggs (usually by dying, but often by spray-painting). A similar tradition of egg painting exists in areas of the world influenced by the culture of Persia. Before the spring equinox in the Persian New Year tradition (called Norouz), each family member decorates a hard-boiled egg and they set them together in a bowl. In Northern Europe and North America, Easter eggs may be hidden by adults for children to find in an Easter egg hunt. They may be rolled in some traditions. In Eastern and Central Europe, and parts of England, Easter eggs may be tapped against each other to see whose egg breaks first. Since the sixteenth century, the tradition of a dancing egg is held during the feast of Corpus Christi in Barcelona and other Catalan cities. It consists of an hollow eggshell, positioned over the water jet from a fountain, which causes the eggshell to revolve without falling.

For a period of time, between 1976 and 1981, all assemblies were dissolved due to legal restrictions. The 2001 census reported 1,211 Bah√° º√≠s (including 496 children), and since the 1990s the Bah√° º√≠ community of Nepal has been involved in a number of interfaith organizations including the Inter-religious Council of Nepal promoting peace in the country. The Association of Religion Data Archives (relying on World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated some 4,300 Bah√° º√≠s in 2005. Early days In the 1920-1940 period Col.

News of the religion also arrived following a United Nations conference in Colombo at which Nepalese delegates expressed interest in the religion. Following conversions and further pioneers the first Local Spiritual Assembly in Nepal was that of Kathmandu city which was elected in 1959. In 1960 there were assemblies in Kathmandu, Dohlka Shahr, and Bhaktapur and smaller groups of Bah√° º√≠s in Dharan, Baklong, Pokhara, and Biratnagar; and over one hundred members of the religion.

On 29 September 1990 Hand of the Cause Collis Featherstone died and is buried in Kathmandu. Modern community Since its inception the religion has had involvement in socio- economic development beginning by giving greater freedom to women, promulgating the promotion of female education as a priority concern, and that involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics. The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the Universal House of Justice dated 20 October 1983 was released. Bah√° º√≠s were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the Bah√° º√≠ teachings, in which they could become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. Worldwide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bah√° º√≠ socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1,482. Since the early 1990s the Bah√° º√≠s of Nepal have involved themselves in diverse concerns in Nepal. One group of Bah√° º√≠s set up an organization \\"Education, Curriculum, and Training Associates\\", or \\"ECTA\\", which means \\"unity\\" in Nepali, in 1997 to promote rural development strategies and programs that can be done at low cost by village groups without extensive outside aid. Nepalese Bah√° º√≠s joined the Inter-religious Council of Nepal promoting peace in the country who have also met with CPN Maoist leadership and consulted on AIDS issues.

The WEP program has reached more than 130,000 women in Nepal and has also received considerable support from the Bah√° º√≠ community of Nepal. In December 2003 a conference entitled \\"Education: The Right of Every Girl and Boy,\\" brought together representatives of five South Asian countries by government officials and members of the Bah√° º√≠ communities: Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka and was co-sponsored and supported by: the Bah√° º√≠ International Community, UNESCO, World Vision India, National Foundation for India, Save the Children UK, Commonwealth Education Fund, and India Alliance for Child Rights.

It is located in the coastal town of Lincoln City, in the U.S. state of Oregon. This hospital serves the residents and visitors of Lincoln County. History Since the 1930s, there had been interest in establishing a hospital in Lincoln City, Oregon, but it wasn't until the 1960s that these efforts gained widespread community support. In 1963, a hospital feasibility committee was organized. Its members helped to lay the groundwork for passage of a ballot measure in April 1965 to form a hospital taxing district. The district, then known as North Lincoln Hospital District and now known as the North Lincoln Health District, covers 115 square miles of north Lincoln County. With tax proceeds, federal grant money and the sale of general obligation bonds, the health district was prepared to begin construction of a hospital. On Sept. 23, 1967, Oregon Gov. Tom McCall presided at a formal groundbreaking ceremony on a nine-acre tract of land overlooking Devils Lake in the northeast corner of Lincoln City. The governor returned to the site to deliver the dedication speech on Oct. 13, 1968. The doors of the new hospital officially opened on Oct. 28, 1968, with 50 full-time staff members. Six patients were admitted on its first day and two babies were born there during its first week. On February 29, 2000 the North Lincoln Health District and Samaritan Health Services entered into an interim management agreement. The parties then entered into a 30-year Healthcare Facilities Lease on Jan. 1, 2001, in which Samaritan Health Services agreed to manage and operate the hospital and adjoining properties owned by the health district. In the autumn of 2015, the health district and Samaritan Health Services agreed to a memorandum of understanding in which ownership of the district's hospital facilities and real properties totaling 12 acres would be transferred to Samaritan Health Services. In turn, Samaritan Health Services agreed to construct a new hospital on the existing campus within three years. The transfer of assets was legally completed on Feb. 3, 2016. In July 2018, construction began on a replacement hospital building, which is planned to open in early 2020. Samaritan Health Services selected Skanska USA Building and HGA Architects and Engineers as the design/build team responsible for planning, designing, and construction of the new Samaritan North Lincoln Hospital, which is being built directly east of the existing hospital building. Operations The facility offers a wide range of inpatient and outpatient medical services including emergency services, general surgery, diagnostic imaging (radiology), laboratory testing, colonoscopy and upper endoscopies, pharmacy services, obstetrics and gynecology, respiratory therapy and diabetes education. The hospital is a level IV trauma center and serves the entire county, plus portions of neighboring counties. The hospital offers many digital imaging services onsite including MRI machine, a 160-slice CAT scanner, PET scan, echocardiography, DEXA bone density testing, 3-D digital mammography, 3-D ultrasound and digital X-ray imaging. Outpatient services The hospital campus has additional clinics and ancillary services. This includes outpatient medical and surgical clinics, an infusion center for oncology and non-oncology needs, anticoagulation services, wound & ostomy clinic, and home health & hospice services. Physical rehabilitation services available include occupational, physical and speech therapy. Primary care is available with physicians trained in family medicine, internal medicine and pediatrics. Specialty clinicians offer cardiology and cardiac device management, mental health and psychiatry, nephrology, orthopedics, podiatry and urology. North Lincoln Hospital Foundation The North Lincoln Hospital Foundation is a 501(c)(3) organization that raises private philanthropic support for Samaritan North Lincoln Hospital and to invest and manage these gifts to honor donors‚Äô wishes. All funds raised are kept local to support the hospital.North Lincoln Hospital Foundation Since their inception in 1983, they have provided more than $2.9 million to purchase medical equipment for the hospital, enhance program services, provide financial support for patient and community wellness programs, and help low-income individuals obtain medical care, including the provision of medical assistance grants of over $1.65 million to north Lincoln County residents. Medical equipment purchases in 2016 included $175,000 for a cardiac ultrasound machine and $19,000 for video laryngoscope glidescopes for use in the emergency department, surgical services and ICU. There were quality of life donations for hospice patients - funding for non-medical, life-enhancing support such as travel for family members, massages, and music. They also gave three $1,000 Mary Decker Scholarships awarded to students pursuing a health care career. From 2017 to 2020 the foundation and community will aim to raise $7 Million for equipment needs of the replacement hospital building.

Mrs. Hendricks was a native of North Bend, Ohio, having been born there in 1823.,\\"Death of Mrs. Eliza Carol Hendricks\\", Middlebury Independent, Friday, November 06, 1903, Middlebury, Indiana, United States Of America and since that time she had resided in Indiana. Her first Hoosier home was in Shelbyville, in which place her husband was then engaged in the practice of law. They removed to Indianapolis in 1860, where he practiced for some years as a member of the law firm of Hendricks, Hord & Hendricks. Mrs. Hendricks was fond of domestic life and was the administrator of the household, saving her husband from all unnecessary annoyance or responsibility, and in many other ways was she his true help-mate. Her husband depended much upon her judgment. Often, while an occupant of the gubernatorial chair when perplexed over applications for the pardon of criminals, did he call her into the conference, in order to avail himself of her intuitive perception of the merits of the case. Mrs. Hendricks' loved of nature. She had a great penchant for pets. Her fondness for horses led to the close observation of them which made her a good judge of their qualities, and it was she, not her husband, who always selected the carriage horses. Upon her husband's inauguration Mrs. Hendricks became the 12th Second Lady (wife of the 21st Vice President) of the United States. Her husband, who had been in poor health for several years, served as vice president during the last eight months of his life, from his inauguration on March 4 until his death on November 25, 1885. The vice presidency remained vacant after Hendricks's death until Levi P. Morton assumed office in 1889. There is little to nothing written about her time as the Second Lady of the United States. Mrs. Hendricks was not only the light of her husband's home life, but, wherever his official duties called him, he was accompanied by her, and when he twice visited the Old World, in quest of health, she was his faithful companion. The great sorrow of her life was his death, which occurred in November, 1885. Thomas A. Hendricks died unexpectedly on November 25, 1885, during a trip home to Indianapolis. He complained of feeling ill the morning of November 24, went to bed early, and died in his sleep the following day. Thomas Hendricks only served as vice president for about eight months, from March 4, 1885, until his death on November 25, 1885, in Indianapolis. After her husband's death she had sought relief from grief and loneliness in a quickening of activities, especially in the lines of charity. Her most prominent philanthropic work was her persevering efforts, with other earnest women, to establish a \\"Prison for Women and Reform School for Girls.\\" In answer to earnest and persistent solicitation on their part, the State Legislature made an appropriation, and in 1883 the building was erected. That institution had, from its beginning, been under the entire control and management of women. For some years it was the only one of its kind in the country. Mrs. Hendricks had, from its beginning, been the president of its board of managers. Mrs. Hendricks was described as \\"generous, wise and discreet\\". She died on November 3, 1903 in Indianapolis after being paralyzed for three weeks.\\"Mrs. Eliza Hendricks is Dead\\", Logansport Pharos Tribune, Tuesday, November 03, 1903, Logansport, Indiana, United States Of America She was buried with her husband at Crown Hill Cemetery Indianapolis, Marion County, Indiana, She was 79 at the time of her death.

His buildings were known for his imaginative and exuberant decoration, and particularly for his use of sculpture and glazed ceramic tiles on the facades, made in collaboration with leading sculptors and the ceramic manufacturer Alexandre Bigot. He was three times awarded prizes by the city of Paris for the most original facades, for the Lavirotte Building at 29 Avenue Rapp (1901), for the Ceramic hotel, 34 Avenue de Wagram (1904), and for the building at 23 avenue de Messine (8th arrondissement) in 1907.  Biography  Lavirotte was born in Lyon, and went on to study at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Lyon, where he was a pupil of Antoine Georges Louvier (1818‚Äì92). He subsequently studied at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris under the tutelage of Paul Blondel (1847‚Äì97), and gained his architect's diploma there in 1894.Franco Borsi and Ezio Godoli, Paris 1900, page 213-226, 278 (1978, Granada Publishing Ltd., St Albans and London) The first five buildings built by Lavirotte were all in the same part of Paris, the 7th arrondissement. Three were in close proximity to each other, at 3 Square Rapp, 29 Avenue Rapp, and 12 Rue Sedillot. The first two buildings benefited from Lavirotte's collaboration with Alexandre Bigot, a chemistry professor who imported the technology of making glazed earthenware tiles, which he had seen at the 1889 Paris Exposition. His firm provided the exterior decoration for Lavirotte's most famous buildings, as well as for works by the other prominent art nouveau architects, Three of his buildings were awarded prizes in the Paris facade competition, which gave prizes to several buildings each year; The Lavirotte Building (1901), at 29 Avenue Rapp, his most flamboyant and famous work, known for its extravagant sculpted portal; The Ceramic Hotel, 34 Avenue de Wagram, 8th arrondissement (1904), which also featured ceramic decoration by Bigot; and the building at 23 avenue de Messine in the 8th arrondissement (1906-1907). His last two major Paris buildings, next to each other at 23 Avenue de Messine and 6 rue de Messine, were in a more subdued style, with less flamboyant decoration, but with refined craftsmanship and sculptural ornament. They were his last art nouveau works. In 1904, he traveled to Tunisia, where he designed a villa and a chateau and restored a church in the town of Chaouat. In 1906, he built an experiment in low-cost housing, a bungalow at 169 Boulevard Lefebvre in 15th arrondissement (no longer existing). In 1907, he designed the villa Dupont, located at 2 rue Balzac in Franconville, Val-d'Oise, in the Paris suburbs. He died in 1929, and his work was largely ignored until the 1960s, when art nouveau was rediscovered. His major works were declared historic landmarks, and he was recognized, along with Hector Guimard and Henri Sauvage. as one of the major figures of the Paris art nouveau, Notable works (1898-1899) <gallery mode=\\"packed\\" heights=\\"200px> File:Lavirotte 151 rue de Grenelle facade.JPGFacade of 151 rue de Grenelle (1898) File:Lavirotte 151 rue de Grenelle doorway.JPGDoorway of the building at 151 rue de Grenelle (1898) File:12 rue sedillot 75007.JPGThe Istituto Statale Italiano Leonardo Da Vinci head office and secondary school (Lyc√©e Italien) at 12 rue Sedillot (1899) File:Lavirotte Lyc√©e Italien detail.JPGDetail of the Lyc√©e Italien, rue Sedillot (1899)  151 Rue de Grenelle, 7th arrondissement (1898)  The first major building designed by Lavirotte. Its facade‚Äîinfluenced by the French Rococo style‚Äîoffers only hints of the theatrical displays for which Lavirotte was to become known.  12 Rue Sedillot, 7th arrondissement (1899)  This building is very close to two other notable Lavirotte buildings, at 3 Square Rapp and 29 Avenue Rapp. The building was originally commissioned by the Comtesse de Montessuy as her residence, and is sometimes called the H√¥tel Montessuy. It was completed in 1899. It became the headquarters of a political party in the 1930s, and then a school, the Lyc√©e Italien Leonardo-de-VInci. While the style of the facade is largely Louis XV, it also includes a display of the imaginative details and exuberant decoration that characterize the work of Lavirotte. The use of a railing with ceramic columns on the first floor balcony was repeated by Lavirotte at 3 Square Rapp and 29 Avenue Rapp. The interior was extensively modified when the residence was made into a school. The winding stairway, with an art nouveau wrought iron railing, is one of the few original features that survived. The courtyard behind the house was made into a gymnasium; the former rear exterior wall of the house is now an interior wall of that room.

It featured many of the art nouveau features of his later buildings, including a very ornate doorway and whimsical borrowings from earlier architectural periods, and also made extensive use of the decorative ceramic tiles of Alexanadre Bigot on the upper floors of the facade. The ornamental tower on the corner rests on column. The building is separated from the street by an ornamental grill and small fountain by Lavirotte, which frames a remarkable view of the Eiffel Tower.  29 Avenue Rapp, 7th arrondissement (1901)  The large scale deployment of glazed earthenware on the facade of the Lavirotte Building in 1901 was the first example of its kind in the West.Maurice Rheims: The Age of Art Nouveau, page 32 (1966, Thames and Hudson, London) Glazed tiles embedded in the stone and in the bricks are the work of ceramicist Alexandre Bigot; the building proved to be an effective advertisement for his wares.The Grove Dictionary of Art (1996, ) It was very lavishly adorned even by the standards of the many ceramically finished facades that were built in the following years, which were for the most part appointed this way because this was a way to protect and beautify the iron and concrete materials whose use was fast becoming the standard. The building at 29 avenue Rapp also had a highly exotic door frame designed by the sculptor Jean-Baptiste Larrive, and sculpted by Messrs Th√©obald-Joseph Sporrer, Firmin-Marcelin Michelet, and Alfred Jean Halou.Maurice Rheims: The Age of Art Nouveau, page 32 (1966, Thames and Hudson, London) Later buildings (1904-1907) <gallery mode=\\"packed\\" heights=\\"200px> File:Ceramic hotel.jpgCeramic Hotel (1904) File:H√¥tel C√©ramic, art nouveau (Paris) (5072808987).jpgCeramic Hotel upper facade decoration File:C√©ramic H√¥tel.jpgGround floor of the Ceramic Hotel File:P1080505 Paris VIII rue de Messine rwk.jpg23 Avenue Messine (left) and 6 rue Massine (right) show the more subdued style of Lavirotte's later buildings (1906‚Äì07) Ceramic Hotel, 34 avenue de Wagram (8th arrondissement) (1904) The Ceramic Hotel, located at 34 avenue de Wagram in the 8th arrondissement, was built in 1904. It was constructed of reinforced concrete, and the ceramic decoration on the facade was made by the firm of Alexandre Bigot. The sculptural decoration of climbing plants on the exterior of the first floor is signed by the sculptor Camille Alaphilippe, a winner of the Prix de Rome given by the Academy of Fine Arts. The building was a winner of the city competition for best facade in 1905. It originally was a maison meubl√©e, a furnished house or an establishment which rented furnished rooms. It later became an hotel, the Elys√©e-Ceramic H√¥tel, and still later took its current name. Almost all of the original interior decoration disappeared when it became an hotel, but a few of the original details, including a stairway and a stained glass window in the stairway, remain. It was listed as an historic monument in 1964. Number 6 Rue de Messine and number 23 Avenue de Messine (8th arrondissement) (1906-1907) The two buildings on Avenue and rue Messine are next to each other, were built at about the same time, and followed a very similar design. Number 23, on the corner of avenue de Messine and rue Messine, was an h√¥tel particulaire, a private residence, and was originally just three stories high. The four upper floors and small tower were added later. Number 23 was a winner in the 1907 facade competition. The style of both buildings was more subdued than his earlier buildings, but both still featured a lavish use of sculpted ceramic tiles, wrought iron balconies, and floral sculpture above the entrance on the rounded corner number 23. The sculpture on both buildings was the work of L√©on Binet.

PGS is potentially serious, and may require amputation. PGS is most common among elderly patients and those receiving multiple large intravenous doses of the epilepsy drug phenytoin. Compartment syndrome is a complication of PGS. Cause Purple glove syndrome is caused by the intravenous anticonvulsant phenytoin. This medication has many already established neurological side effects, however glove syndrome is a rare, but very serious adverse effect that may lead to limb amputations. This may occur due to the administration of phenytoin with or without extravasation. The defining characteristic is a purplish to black discoloration of the extremity followed by peripheral edema and pain distal to the site of infusion. Onset is generally seen within the first few hours of administration. The true pathology of purple glove syndrome is not fully elucidated, however it is believed to be due to the crystallization of phenytoin within the blood and extravasates into the surrounding interstitium. Another mechanism may be due to the disruption of endothelial transcellular junctions followed by leaking of phenytoin into the surround soft tissues. Diagnosis Treatment Doctors recommend discontinuing the use of phenytoin. The application of heat can help to relieve pain. Oral phenytoin can also result in development of purple glove syndrome.

Harmonic frequencies in the power grid are a frequent cause of power quality problems. Harmonics in power systems result in increased heating in the equipment and conductors, misfiring in variable speed drives, and torque pulsations in motors. Current harmonics In a normal alternating current power system, the current varies sinusoidally at a specific frequency, usually 50 or 60 hertz. When a linear electrical load is connected to the system, it draws a sinusoidal current at the same frequency as the voltage (though usually not in phase with the voltage). Current harmonics are caused by non- linear loads. When a non-linear load, such as a rectifier is connected to the system, it draws a current that is not necessarily sinusoidal. The current waveform distortion can be quite complex, depending on the type of load and its interaction with other components of the system. Regardless of how complex the current waveform becomes, the Fourier series transform makes it possible to deconstruct the complex waveform into a series of simple sinusoids, which start at the power system fundamental frequency and occur at integer multiples of the fundamental frequency. Further examples of non-linear loads include common office equipment such as computers and printers, Fluorescent lighting, battery chargers and also variable-speed drives. In power systems, harmonics are defined as positive integer multiples of the fundamental frequency. Thus, the third harmonic is the third multiple of the fundamental frequency. Harmonics in power systems are generated by non-linear loads. Semiconductor devices like transistors, IGBTs, MOSFETS, diodes etc are all non-linear loads. Further examples of non-linear loads include common office equipment such as computers and printers, Fluorescent lighting, battery chargers and also variable-speed drives. Electric motors do not normally contribute significantly to harmonic generation. Both motors and transformers will however create harmonics when they are over-fluxed or saturated. Non-linear load currents create distortion in the pure sinusoidal voltage waveform supplied by the utility, and this may result in resonance. The even harmonics do not normally exist in power system due to symmetry between the positive- and negative- halves of a cycle. Further, if the waveforms of the three phases are symmetrical, the harmonic multiples of three are suppressed by delta (Œî) connection of transformers and motors as described below. If we focus for example on only the third harmonic, we can see how all harmonics with a multiple of three behaves in powers systems. 3rd Order Harmonic Addition Power is supplied by a three phase system, where each phase is 120 degrees apart. This is done for two reasons: mainly because three-phase generators and motors are simpler to construct due to constant torque developed across the three phase phases; and secondly, if the three phases are balanced, they sum to zero, and the size of neutral conductors can be reduced or even omitted in some cases. Both these measures results in significant costs savings to utility companies. However, the balanced third harmonic current will not add to zero in the neutral. As seen in the figure, the 3rd harmonic will add constructively across the three phases. This leads to a current in the neutral wire at three times the fundamental frequency, which can cause problems if the system is not designed for it, (i.e. conductors sized only for normal operation.) To reduce the effect of the third order harmonics delta connections are used as attenuators, or third harmonic shorts as the current circulates in the delta the connection instead of flowing in the neutral of a wye connection. A compact fluorescent lamp is one example of an electrical load with a non-linear characteristic, due to the rectifier circuit it uses. The current waveform, blue, is highly distorted. Voltage harmonics Voltage harmonics are mostly caused by current harmonics. The voltage provided by the voltage source will be distorted by current harmonics due to source impedance. If the source impedance of the voltage source is small, current harmonics will cause only small voltage harmonics. It is typically the case that voltage harmonics are indeed small compared to current harmonics. For that reason, the voltage waveform can usually be approximated by the fundamental frequency of voltage. If this approximation is used, current harmonics produce no effect on the real power transferred to the load. An intuitive way to see this comes from sketching the voltage wave at fundamental frequency and overlaying a current harmonic with no phase shift (in order to more easily observe the following phenomenon). What can be observed is that for every period of voltage, there is equal area above the horizontal axis and below the current harmonic wave as there is below the axis and above the current harmonic wave. This means that the average real power contributed by current harmonics is equal to zero. However, if higher harmonics of voltage are considered, then current harmonics do make a contribution to the real power transferred to the load. Total harmonic distortion Total harmonic distortion, or THD is a common measurement of the level of harmonic distortion present in power systems. THD can be related to either current harmonics or voltage harmonics, and it is defined as the ratio of total harmonics to the value at fundamental frequency times 100%. : \\\\mathit{THD_V} = \\\\frac{ \\\\sqrt{V_2^2 + V_3^2 + V_4^2 + \\\\cdots + V_n^2} }{V_1} \\\\cdot 100\\\\% = \\\\frac{ \\\\sqrt{ \\\\sum_{k \\\\mathop = 2}^{n}V_k^2} }{V_1} \\\\cdot 100\\\\% : {THD_I} = \\\\frac{ \\\\sqrt{I_2^2 + I_3^2 + I_4^2 + \\\\cdots + I_n^2} }{I_1} \\\\cdot 100\\\\% = \\\\frac{ \\\\sqrt{ \\\\sum_{k \\\\mathop = 2}^{n}I_k^2} }{I_1} \\\\cdot 100\\\\% where Vk is the RMS voltage of kth harmonic, Ik is the RMS current of the kth harmonic, and k = 1 is the fundamental frequency. It is usually the case that we neglect higher voltage harmonics; however, if we do not neglect them, real power transferred to the load is affected by harmonics. Average real power can be found by adding the product of voltage and current (and power factor, denoted by pf here) at each higher frequency to the product of voltage and current at the fundamental frequency, or : {P_{avg}} = \\\\sum_{k \\\\mathop = 1}^{\\\\infty} V_k \\\\cdot I_k \\\\cdot pf = P_{avg, 1} + P_{avg, 2} + \\\\cdots where Vk and Ik are the RMS voltage and current magnitudes at harmonic k (k = 1 denotes the fundamental frequency), and P_{avg, 1} is the conventional definition of power without factoring in harmonic components. The power factor mentioned above is the displacement power factor. There is another power factor that depends on THD. True power factor can be taken to mean the ratio between average real power and the magnitude of RMS voltage and current, pf_{true}=\\\\frac{P_{avg}}{V_{rms} I_{rms}}. : {V_{rms}} = V_{1, rms} \\\\sqrt{ 1 + \\\\left(\\\\frac{ THD_V}{100}\\\\right)^2} and : {I_{rms}} = I_{1, rms} \\\\sqrt{ 1 + \\\\left(\\\\frac{ THD_I}{100}\\\\right)^2} Substituting this in for the equation for true power factor, it becomes clear that the quantity can be taken to have two components, one of which is the traditional power factor (neglecting the influence of harmonics) and one of which is the harmonics‚Äô contribution to power factor: : {pf_{true}} = \\\\frac{ P_{avg}}{V_{1, rms} I_{1, rms}} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1}{ \\\\sqrt{ 1 + \\\\left( \\\\frac{THD_V}{100}\\\\right)^2} \\\\sqrt{ 1 + \\\\left( \\\\frac{ THD_I}{100}\\\\right)^2}}. Names are assigned to the two distinct factors as follows: : pf_{true} = pf_{disp} \\\\cdot pf_{dist}, where pf_{disp} is the displacement power factor and pf_{dist} is the distortion power factor (i.e. the harmonics' contribution to total power factor). Effects One of the major effects of power system harmonics is to increase the current in the system. This is particularly the case for the third harmonic, which causes a sharp increase in the zero sequence current, and therefore increases the current in the neutral conductor. This effect can require special consideration in the design of an electric system to serve non-linear loads.For example, see the National Electrical Code: \\"A 3-phase, 4-wire, wye- connected power system used to supply power to nonlinear loads may necessitate that the power system design allow for the possibility of high harmonic neutral currents. (Article 220.61(C), FPN No. 2)\\" In addition to the increased line current, different pieces of electrical equipment can suffer effects from harmonics on the power system. Motors Electric motors experience losses due to hysteresis and eddy currents set up in the iron core of the motor. These are proportional to the frequency of the current. Since the harmonics are at higher frequencies, they produce higher core losses in a motor than the power frequency would. This results in increased heating of the motor core, which (if excessive) can shorten the life of the motor. The 5th harmonic causes a CEMF (counter electromotive force) in large motors which acts in the opposite direction of rotation. The CEMF is not large enough to counteract the rotation; however it does play a small role in the resulting rotating speed of the motor. Telephones In the United States, common telephone lines are designed to transmit frequencies between 300 and 3400 Hz. Since electric power in the United States is distributed at 60 Hz, it normally does not interfere with telephone communications because its frequency is too low. Sources A pure sinusoidal voltage is a conceptual quantity produced by an ideal AC generator built with finely distributed stator and field windings that operate in a uniform magnetic field. Since neither the winding distribution nor the magnetic field are uniform in a working AC machine, voltage waveform distortions are created, and the voltage-time relationship deviates from the pure sine function. The distortion at the point of generation is very small (about 1% to 2%), but nonetheless it exists. Because this is a deviation from a pure sine wave, the deviation is in the form of a periodic function, and by definition, the voltage distortion contains harmonics. When a sinusoidal voltage is applied to a linear load, such as a heating element, the current through it is also sinusoidal. In non-linear loads, such as an amplifier with a clipping distortion, the voltage swing of the applied sinusoid is limited and the pure tone is polluted with a plethora of harmonics. When there is significant impedance in the path from the power source to a nonlinear load, these current distortions will also produce distortions in the voltage waveform at the load. However, in most cases where the power delivery system is functioning correctly under normal conditions, the voltage distortions will be quite small and can usually be ignored. Waveform distortion can be mathematically analysed to show that it is equivalent to superimposing additional frequency components onto a pure sinewave. These frequencies are harmonics (integer multiples) of the fundamental frequency, and can sometimes propagate outwards from nonlinear loads, causing problems elsewhere on the power system. The classic example of a non-linear load is a rectifier with a capacitor input filter, where the rectifier diode only allows current to pass to the load during the time that the applied voltage exceeds the voltage stored in the capacitor, which might be a relatively small portion of the incoming voltage cycle. Other examples of nonlinear loads are battery chargers, electronic ballasts, variable frequency drives, and switching mode power supplies.

It was first proposed in the 1970s but a formal proposal was not announced until 2006. Community opposition and changing needs saw the end of the proposal in November 2010. Hunter Water Corporation divested itself of its Tillegra landholding in 2015, permanently ending the proposal.  Overview  The Tillegra Dam was first proposed by the Hunter Water Corporation in the 1970s, but was deferred indefinitely in the 1980s due to the success of user pays pricing. On 13 November 2006, the NSW Government announced proposals for a A$300 million dam at Tillegra to supply water to the Lower Hunter Region and Central Coast. The justification for the dam was based primarily on climate change and population growth in the Hunter Region.  Opposition  The No Tillegra Dam Group was formed to prevent the building of the dam. Opponents claimed the dam proposal was grossly excessive for need, will drown valuable agricultural land and greater water efficiency, demand management and recycling would eliminate the need for the dam.

During a lifetime career in the Italian Royal Navy (Regia Marina Italiana), he rose to the rank of Admiral and Chief of Staff. In 1933, King Victor Emmanuel III appointed Burzagli as a Senator in Rome.Senato della Repubblica: biographical summary Despite his life service to the state, Burzagli was arrested in 1944 after clashing with Italian dictator Benito Mussolini. Although he was released a short time later, Burzagli was forced to withdraw from public life. Early years Aboard a Japanese naval vessel in Yokohama harbor before sailing to the Battle of Port Arthur (1904). Burzagli entered the Italian Naval Academy (Accademia Navale) in Leghorn (Livorno in Italian) in 1887; and he was commissioned as ensign in 1892.

Burzagli was from a noble family of Montevarchi, but was born in Modena, as his father had relocated there to assume a position as a professor of physics at the Military Academy of Modena. Burzagli graduated from the Accademia Navale di Livorno in 1892, and after serving on a number of ships in the Royal Italian Navy, he was assigned as a military attach√© to Tokyo, Japan in May 1904. He arrived just in time to become an official foreign observer of the Imperial Japanese Navy in the Russo-Japanese War, and witnessed first-hand the naval bombardment of Port Arthur. After the end of the war, in April 1906, he was received by Emperor Meiji of Japan, and received the Order of the Rising Sun before his return to Italy.:File:Portarthur.jpg; :File:Giapp.jpg Naval career In 1912, Burzagli was assigned command of an Intrepid-class destroyer. Promoted to commander in 1914, he saw combat in World War I as commander of a squadron of destroyers, and from May 1916 to March 1917, served on the General Staff of the Italian Navy. In 1917, Captain Burzagli sailed the RN Libia across the Atlantic Ocean to New York City.Malcolm, James. (1917).

Background  Until 2002, the only road links to eastern Manitoba north of 51¬∞ (an area of some 120,000 sq. miles, with numerous communities) were seasonal ice roads. Kichi Sipi Bridge was constructed by the government of Manitoba as a result of a lawsuit by Cross Lake Indian Band.The Cree name of Cross Lake Indian Band is Pimicikamak.

In Claim 109,Northern Flood Agreement, Office of the Arbitrator, accessed 5 September 2008. Cross Lake Indian Band sought damages for governmental failure to build an all-weather road to Cross Lake, including the lack of an all-weather crossing over the Nelson River (originally known as Kichi Sipi, or Great River, in Cree). The governments of Canada and Manitoba took the position that Provincial Road 374, including a ferry crossing over the Nelson River, was an all-weather road. In 1993, the continuing arbitratorNorthern Flood Agreement, Office of the Arbitrator, accessed 5 September 2008. charged with enforcing the agreement found that \\"there is at present no all-weather road connecting Cross Lake and Jenpeg\\" because there was no bridge across the Nelson River.Campbell MacLean, Office of the Arbitrator, Claim 109, Award, 16 December 1993, p. 10.

It is 5th Cell's second Nintendo DS game. It was released in North America on September 8, 2008, in Europe on September 26, 2008 and in Australia on September 25, 2008. On January 6, 2017, the German game ratings board Unterhaltungssoftware Selbstkontrolle (USK) rated Lock's Quest for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC which indicated that the publisher was developing a port for the game. and on 16 February 2017, THQ Nordic officially announced that they were developing a remaster for Lock's Quest scheduled for May 2017 for PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC with development by Digital Continue. Gameplay Lock's Quest is a real-time strategy game, incorporating tower defense gameplay elements. The battlefield, viewed from an isometric perspective, is displayed on the DS's bottom screen. Combat is divided into two phases, Build and Battle. During the Build phase, the player has a limited amount of time and resources to construct defenses, which consist of walls, towers, cannons, machines, and traps. Once the Build phase ends, the Battle phase begins. Plot The game is set in a kingdom, built using a mysterious substance known as Source. The builders of this kingdom, the Archineers, studied source in an attempt to better understand its properties. The greatest archineer was Agonius, who discovered a truly remarkable property of source - that it can emulate life. Agonius started creating lifelike beings from the source, but the King, who understood the dangers of this, demanded that Agonius halt his work. Agonius refused, and so was banished from the kingdom. Seeking vengeance upon the King, Agonius assumed the mantle of Lord Agony and created a clockwork army with the intent of destroying the kingdom. A war ensued, with heavy casualties on both sides. Eventually, two kingdom archineers, Kenan and Jacob, infiltrated Agony's fortress. The exact nature of the events that happened therein are not revealed until the end of the game - all that is known, at first, is that Agony was defeated, and Jacob was missing, presumed dead. Kenan, now a hero, took up the position of Chief Archineer. The game itself begins some years after the events above. Lock is a young man living in a coastal village, along with his sister, Emi, and grandfather, Tobias. When this village (and indeed the entire kingdom) is attacked by a new army of clockworks, under a new Lord Agony, Lock enlists as an archineer and helps to fight the clockworks. After a long time, the Kingdom force prevails and the new Agony is defeated. At the climax of the plot, it is revealed that the new Lord Agony is none other than Jacob. Long ago, when Jacob reached Agonius' chamber, he found Agonius a frail and broken man. He also found the young Lock, who was himself clockwork, the greatest creation of Agonius. Jacob took Lock and raised him as a human, under the guise of Tobias. He created Emi, who is also clockwork, and the village in which Lock was raised. At the end of the game, the King tells Lock that, despite being clockwork, he was truly alive, because Agonius had given Lock his soul. Conversely, Jacob could not bring himself to sacrifice his soul in order to give Emi true life, and so, in time, Emi would simply crumble to dust. However, it is implied that Jacob, repentant and sorrowful for having waged war on the Kingdom, did eventually do so at Lock's request, and the final scene of the game is Lock and Emi playing tag on the beach.

Douche usually refers to vaginal irrigation, the rinsing of the vagina, but it can also refer to the rinsing of any body cavity. A douche bag is a piece of equipment for douching‚Äîa bag for holding the fluid used in douching. To avoid transferring intestinal bacteria into the vagina, the same bag must not be used for an enema and a vaginal douche. Douching after sexual intercourse is not an effective form of birth control. Additionally, douching is associated with a number of health problems, including cervical cancer, pelvic inflammatory disease, endometritis, and increased risk of sexually transmitted infections. Thus, its use is not recommended.  Etymology  The word's first known use is in 1766. Douche came into English via French, from \\"conduit pipe\\" and docciare \\"pour by drops\\" to douche, from doccia water pipe, probably back- formation from doccione conduit, from , ductio means of conveying water, from ducere to lead. In French today it means shower, as it does in many non- English European languages.  Overview  Vaginal douche apparatus with five quart tank from 1905 nursing text Vaginal douches may consist of water, water mixed with vinegar, or even antiseptic chemicals. Douching has been touted as having a number of supposed but unproven benefits. In addition to promising to clean the vagina of unwanted odors, it can also be used by women who wish to avoid smearing a sexual partner's penis with menstrual blood while having sexual intercourse during menstruation. In the past, douching was also used after intercourse as a method of birth control, though it is not effective (see below). Many health-care professionals state that douching is dangerous, as it interferes with both the vagina's normal self-cleaning and with the natural bacterial culture of the vagina, and it might spread or introduce infections. Douching is implicated in a wide variety of dangers, including: adverse pregnancy outcomes including ectopic pregnancy, low birth weight, preterm labor, preterm birth, and chorioamnionitis; serious gynecologic outcomes, including increased risk of cervical cancer, pelvic inflammatory disease, endometritis, and increased risk for sexually transmitted infections, including HIV; it also predisposes women to develop bacterial vaginosis (BV), which is further associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes and increased risk of sexually transmitted infections. Due to this, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services strongly discourages douching, citing the risks of irritation, bacterial vaginosis, and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Frequent douching with water may result in an imbalance of the pH of the vagina, and thus may put women at risk for possible vaginal infections, especially yeast infections. In May 2003, a randomized, controlled, multi- center study was conducted with 1827 women ages 18‚Äì44 who were regular users of a douche product and who had been treated recently for a sexually transmitted bacterial infection or bacterial vaginosis. Women were randomly assigned to use either a newly designed and marketed douche product or a soft cloth towelette. There was little or no indication of a greater risk of PID among women assigned to use the douche product (versus soft cloth towelette). The \\"fountain syringe\\" is used for douching, by replacing the attached enema nozzle with the vaginal nozzle (shown bottom left). The vaginal nozzle is longer and thicker and has lateral holes Antiseptics used during douching disturb the natural balance of bacteria in the vagina and can cause infections. Unclean douching equipment may introduce foreign bodies into the vagina. Douching may also wash bacteria into the uterus and Fallopian tubes, causing fertility problems. For these reasons, the practice of douching is now strongly discouraged except when ordered by a physician for medical reasons. Douching after intercourse is estimated to reduce the chances of conception by only about 30%. In comparison, proper male condom use reduces the chance of conception by as much as 98%. In some cases douching may force the ejaculate further into the vagina, increasing the chance of pregnancy. A review of studies by researchers at the University of Rochester Medical Center (N.Y.) showed that women who douched regularly and later became pregnant had higher rates of ectopic pregnancy, infections, and low birth weight infants than women who only douched occasionally or who never douched. A 1995 survey quoted in the University of Rochester study found that 27% of U.S. women age 15 to 44 douched regularly, but that douching was more common among African-American women (over 50%) than among white women (21%), and frequent douching contributes to more frequent bacterial vaginosis among African-American women than the average. Medical doctor Harriet Hall writes that not only can douching change the pH of the vagina and lead to infections, \\"There is no need ... to cleanse the vagina. It cleanses itself\\". Slang uses Douchebag and its variants, or simply douche, are pejorative terms referring to an arrogant, obnoxious, or despicable person. The slang usage of the term originated in the 1960s.

Stevenson I, who served in the second administration of President Grover Cleveland. Biography Letitia Stevenson Early life Letitia Green was born on January 8, 1843. She was the daughter of Presbyterian Reverend Lewis W. Green (1806‚Äì1863), who was the head of Centre College in Danville, Kentucky, and Mary Peachy Fry, a descendant of surveyor and adventurer Joshua Fry. She was educated at the Walnut Hill Female Institute in Lexington, Kentucky, and a school near Gramercy Park in New York City. Upon the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, she returned to Lexington. After her father died the next year, Green moved with her mother north to Chenoa, Illinois, where her sister Julia lived. There, she met and was courted by Adlai Ewing Stevenson, a graduate of Centre. The pair wed at Julia's house on December 22, 1866. The Stevensons moved into a house in nearby Bloomington in 1869, shortly after the birth of their first child, Lewis, so named for her father. They carefully planned their family in an era before this was common or publicly accepted. Letitia maintained the household in the frequent absence of her husband. Daughter Mary, nicknamed \\"Bessie\\", was sickly as a child and eventually succumbed to tuberculosis in 1895. Lewis was also frequently hospitalized due to complications from an injury sustained while hunting. Stevenson traveled with her son to sanitariums across the region. Eventually, Stevenson's responsibilities waned as Lewis married and daughters Julia and Letitia left for boarding school. After a political appointment in 1884 led to a move to Washington, D.C., Stevenson became engrossed in the emerging women's rights movement. When Adlai was nominated for Vice President of the United States in 1892, Letitia campaigned on his behalf. Already used to public speaking through her leadership of Bloomington women's clubs, Stevenson spoke on her husband's behalf, especially in opposition to the Lodge Bill. She also typically wrote an acknowledgment letter to local media after campaigning in a city. Lewis Stevenson became the Illinois secretary of state and father of Illinois Governor and 1952 and 1956 Presidential candidate Adlai Stevenson. Their great-grandson, Adlai Ewing Stevenson III, was a U.S. senator from Illinois from 1970 to 1981 and an unsuccessful candidate for Governor of Illinois in 1982 and 1986. She suffered from severe rheumatism and migraine headaches that often forced her to wear leg braces. Nonetheless, she was described as a \\"keen observer and judge of people, and a charming hostess\\"\\". She helped establish the Daughters of the American Revolution to try to heal the divisions between North and South after the Civil War and succeeded Mrs. Caroline Harrison as President General. Death She died aged 70 in 1913.

In the common parlance, randomness is the apparent lack of pattern or predictability in events.The Oxford English Dictionary defines \\"random\\" as \\"Having no definite aim or purpose; not sent or guided in a particular direction; made, done, occurring, etc., without method or conscious choice; haphazard.\\" A random sequence of events, symbols or steps often has no order and does not follow an intelligible pattern or combination. Individual random events are by definition unpredictable, but since they often follow a probability distribution, the frequency of different outcomes over numerous events (or \\"trials\\") is predictable. For example, when throwing two dice, the outcome of any particular roll is unpredictable, but a sum of 7 will occur twice as often as 4. In this view, randomness is a measure of uncertainty of an outcome, rather than its haphazardness, and applies to concepts of chance, probability, and information entropy. According to Ramsey theory, ideal randomness is impossible especially for large structures. For example, professor Theodore Motzkin pointed out that \\"while disorder is more probable in general, complete disorder is impossible\\". Misunderstanding of this can lead to numerous conspiracy theories.Ted.com, (May 2016). The origin of countless conspiracy theories Cristian S. Calude stated that: \\"given the impossibility of true randomness, the effort is directed towards studying degrees of randomness\\".Cristian S. Calude, (2017). \\"Quantum Randomness: From Practice to Theory and Back\\" in \\"The Incomputable Journeys Beyond the Turing Barrier\\" Editors: S. Barry Cooper, Mariya I. Soskova, 169‚Äì181, doi:10.1007/978-3-319-43669-2_11. It can be proven that there is infinite hierarchy (in terms of quality or strength) of forms of randomness. The fields of mathematics, probability, and statistics use formal definitions of randomness. In statistics, a random variable is an assignment of a numerical value to each possible outcome of an event space. This association facilitates the identification and the calculation of probabilities of the events. Random variables can appear in random sequences. A random process is a sequence of random variables whose outcomes do not follow a deterministic pattern, but follow an evolution described by probability distributions. These and other constructs are extremely useful in probability theory and the various applications of randomness. Randomness is most often used in statistics to signify well-defined statistical properties. Monte Carlo methods, which rely on random input (such as from random number generators or pseudorandom number generators), are important techniques in science, particularly in the field of computational science.Third Workshop on Monte Carlo Methods, Jun Liu, Professor of Statistics, Harvard University By analogy, quasi-Monte Carlo methods use quasi-random number generators. Random selection, when narrowly associated with a simple random sample, is a method of selecting items (often called units) from a population where the probability of choosing a specific item is the proportion of those items in the population. For example, with a bowl containing just 10 red marbles and 90 blue marbles, a random selection mechanism would choose a red marble with probability 1/10. Note that a random selection mechanism that selected 10 marbles from this bowl would not necessarily result in 1 red and 9 blue. In situations where a population consists of items that are distinguishable, a random selection mechanism requires equal probabilities for any item to be chosen. That is, if the selection process is such that each member of a population, say research subjects, has the same probability of being chosen, then we can say the selection process is random.  History  Ancient fresco of dice players in Pompei. In ancient history, the concepts of chance and randomness were intertwined with that of fate. Many ancient peoples threw dice to determine fate, and this later evolved into games of chance. Most ancient cultures used various methods of divination to attempt to circumvent randomness and fate.Handbook to life in ancient Rome by Lesley Adkins 1998 page 279Religions of the ancient world by Sarah Iles Johnston 2004 page 370 The Chinese of 3000 years ago were perhaps the earliest people to formalize odds and chance. The Greek philosophers discussed randomness at length, but only in non- quantitative forms. It was only in the 16th century that Italian mathematicians began to formalize the odds associated with various games of chance. The invention of calculus had a positive impact on the formal study of randomness. In the 1888 edition of his book The Logic of Chance, John Venn wrote a chapter on The conception of randomness that included his view of the randomness of the digits of pi, by using them to construct a random walk in two dimensions.Annotated readings in the history of statistics by Herbert Aron David, 2001 page 115. Note that the 1866 edition of Venn's book (on Google books) does not include this chapter. The early part of the 20th century saw a rapid growth in the formal analysis of randomness, as various approaches to the mathematical foundations of probability were introduced. In the mid- to late-20th century, ideas of algorithmic information theory introduced new dimensions to the field via the concept of algorithmic randomness. Although randomness had often been viewed as an obstacle and a nuisance for many centuries, in the 20th century computer scientists began to realize that the deliberate introduction of randomness into computations can be an effective tool for designing better algorithms. In some cases, such randomized algorithms even outperform the best deterministic methods.  In science  Many scientific fields are concerned with randomness: * Algorithmic probability * Chaos theory * Cryptography * Game theory * Information theory * Pattern recognition * Probability theory * Quantum mechanics * Statistical mechanics * Statistics  In the physical sciences  In the 19th century, scientists used the idea of random motions of molecules in the development of statistical mechanics to explain phenomena in thermodynamics and the properties of gases. According to several standard interpretations of quantum mechanics, microscopic phenomena are objectively random. That is, in an experiment that controls all causally relevant parameters, some aspects of the outcome still vary randomly. For example, if a single unstable atom is placed in a controlled environment, it cannot be predicted how long it will take for the atom to decay‚Äîonly the probability of decay in a given time.\\"Each nucleus decays spontaneously, at random, in accordance with the blind workings of chance.\\" Q for Quantum, John Gribbin Thus, quantum mechanics does not specify the outcome of individual experiments, but only the probabilities. Hidden variable theories reject the view that nature contains irreducible randomness: such theories posit that in the processes that appear random, properties with a certain statistical distribution are at work behind the scenes, determining the outcome in each case.  In biology  The modern evolutionary synthesis ascribes the observed diversity of life to random genetic mutations followed by natural selection. The latter retains some random mutations in the gene pool due to the systematically improved chance for survival and reproduction that those mutated genes confer on individuals who possess them. Several authors also claim that evolution (and sometimes development) requires a specific form of randomness, namely the introduction of qualitatively new behaviors. Instead of the choice of one possibility among several pre-given ones, this randomness corresponds to the formation of new possibilities. The characteristics of an organism arise to some extent deterministically (e.g., under the influence of genes and the environment), and to some extent randomly. For example, the density of freckles that appear on a person's skin is controlled by genes and exposure to light; whereas the exact location of individual freckles seems random. As far as behavior is concerned, randomness is important if an animal is to behave in a way that is unpredictable to others. For instance, insects in flight tend to move about with random changes in direction, making it difficult for pursuing predators to predict their trajectories.  In mathematics  The mathematical theory of probability arose from attempts to formulate mathematical descriptions of chance events, originally in the context of gambling, but later in connection with physics. Statistics is used to infer the underlying probability distribution of a collection of empirical observations. For the purposes of simulation, it is necessary to have a large supply of random numbers‚Äîor means to generate them on demand. Algorithmic information theory studies, among other topics, what constitutes a random sequence. The central idea is that a string of bits is random if and only if it is shorter than any computer program that can produce that string (Kolmogorov randomness), which means that random strings are those that cannot be compressed. Pioneers of this field include Andrey Kolmogorov and his student Per Martin-L√∂f, Ray Solomonoff, and Gregory Chaitin. For the notion of infinite sequence, one normally uses Per Martin-L√∂f's definition. That is, an infinite sequence is random if and only if it withstands all recursively enumerable null sets. The other notions of random sequences include, among others, recursive randomness and Schnorr randomness, which are based on recursively computable martingales. It was shown by Yongge Wang that these randomness notions are generally different.Yongge Wang: Randomness and Complexity. PhD Thesis, 1996. http://webpages.uncc.edu/yonwang/papers/thesis.pdf Randomness occurs in numbers such as log (2) and pi. The decimal digits of pi constitute an infinite sequence and \\"never repeat in a cyclical fashion.\\" Numbers like pi are also considered likely to be normal, which means their digits are random in a certain statistical sense. > Pi certainly seems to behave this way. In the first six billion decimal > places of pi, each of the digits from 0 through 9 shows up about six hundred > million times. Yet such results, conceivably accidental, do not prove > normality even in base 10, much less normality in other number bases.  In statistics  In statistics, randomness is commonly used to create simple random samples. This allows surveys of completely random groups of people to provide realistic data that is reflective of the population. Common methods of doing this include drawing names out of a hat, or using a random digit chart (a large table of random digits).  In information science  In information science, irrelevant or meaningless data is considered noise. Noise consists of numerous transient disturbances, with a statistically randomized time distribution. In communication theory, randomness in a signal is called \\"noise\\", and is opposed to that component of its variation that is causally attributable to the source, the signal. In terms of the development of random networks, for communication randomness rests on the two simple assumptions of Paul Erd≈ës and Alfr√©d R√©nyi, who said that there were a fixed number of nodes and this number remained fixed for the life of the network, and that all nodes were equal and linked randomly to each other.Laszso Barabasi, (2003), Linked, Rich Gets Richer, P81  In finance  The random walk hypothesis considers that asset prices in an organized market evolve at random, in the sense that the expected value of their change is zero but the actual value may turn out to be positive or negative. More generally, asset prices are influenced by a variety of unpredictable events in the general economic environment.  In politics  Random selection can be an official method to resolve tied elections in some jurisdictions.Municipal Elections Act (Ontario, Canada) 1996, c. 32, Sched., s. 62 (3) : \\"If the recount indicates that two or more candidates who cannot both or all be declared elected to an office have received the same number of votes, the clerk shall choose the successful candidate or candidates by lot.\\" Its use in politics is very old, as office holders in Ancient Athens were chosen by lot, there being no voting.  Randomness and religion  Randomness can be seen as conflicting with the deterministic ideas of some religions, such as those where the universe is created by an omniscient deity who is aware of all past and future events. If the universe is regarded to have a purpose, then randomness can be seen as impossible. This is one of the rationales for religious opposition to evolution, which states that non-random selection is applied to the results of random genetic variation. Hindu and Buddhist philosophies state that any event is the result of previous events, as is reflected in the concept of karma. As such, this conception is at odd with the idea of randomness, and any reconciliation between both of them would require an explanation. In some religious contexts, procedures that are commonly perceived as randomizers are used for divination. Cleromancy uses the casting of bones or dice to reveal what is seen as the will of the gods.  Applications  In most of its mathematical, political, social and religious uses, randomness is used for its innate \\"fairness\\" and lack of bias. Politics: Athenian democracy was based on the concept of isonomia (equality of political rights), and used complex allotment machines to ensure that the positions on the ruling committees that ran Athens were fairly allocated. Allotment is now restricted to selecting jurors in Anglo-Saxon legal systems, and in situations where \\"fairness\\" is approximated by randomization, such as selecting jurors and military draft lotteries. Games: Random numbers were first investigated in the context of gambling, and many randomizing devices, such as dice, shuffling playing cards, and roulette wheels, were first developed for use in gambling. The ability to produce random numbers fairly is vital to electronic gambling, and, as such, the methods used to create them are usually regulated by government Gaming Control Boards. Random drawings are also used to determine lottery winners. In fact, randomness has been used for games of chance throughout history, and to select out individuals for an unwanted task in a fair way (see drawing straws). Sports: Some sports, including American football, use coin tosses to randomly select starting conditions for games or seed tied teams for postseason play. The National Basketball Association uses a weighted lottery to order teams in its draft. Mathematics: Random numbers are also employed where their use is mathematically important, such as sampling for opinion polls and for statistical sampling in quality control systems. Computational solutions for some types of problems use random numbers extensively, such as in the Monte Carlo method and in genetic algorithms. Medicine: Random allocation of a clinical intervention is used to reduce bias in controlled trials (e.g., randomized controlled trials). Religion: Although not intended to be random, various forms of divination such as cleromancy see what appears to be a random event as a means for a divine being to communicate their will (see also Free will and Determinism for more).  Generation  The ball in a roulette can be used as a source of apparent randomness, because its behavior is very sensitive to the initial conditions. It is generally accepted that there exist three mechanisms responsible for (apparently) random behavior in systems: # Randomness coming from the environment (for example, Brownian motion, but also hardware random number generators). # Randomness coming from the initial conditions. This aspect is studied by chaos theory, and is observed in systems whose behavior is very sensitive to small variations in initial conditions (such as pachinko machines and dice). # Randomness intrinsically generated by the system. This is also called pseudorandomness, and is the kind used in pseudo-random number generators. There are many algorithms (based on arithmetics or cellular automaton) for generating pseudorandom numbers. The behavior of the system can be determined by knowing the seed state and the algorithm used. These methods are often quicker than getting \\"true\\" randomness from the environment. The many applications of randomness have led to many different methods for generating random data. These methods may vary as to how unpredictable or statistically random they are, and how quickly they can generate random numbers. Before the advent of computational random number generators, generating large amounts of sufficiently random numbers (which is important in statistics) required a lot of work. Results would sometimes be collected and distributed as random number tables.  Measures and tests  There are many practical measures of randomness for a binary sequence. These include measures based on frequency, discrete transforms, complexity, or a mixture of these, such as the tests by Kak, Phillips, Yuen, Hopkins, Beth and Dai, Mund, and Marsaglia and Zaman.Terry Ritter, Randomness tests: a literature survey. ciphersbyritter.com Quantum nonlocality has been used to certify the presence of genuine or strong form of randomness in a given string of numbers.  Misconceptions and logical fallacies  Popular perceptions of randomness are frequently mistaken, and are often based on fallacious reasoning or intuitions.  A number is \\"due\\"  This argument is, \\"In a random selection of numbers, since all numbers eventually appear, those that have not come up yet are 'due', and thus more likely to come up soon.\\" This logic is only correct if applied to a system where numbers that come up are removed from the system, such as when playing cards are drawn and not returned to the deck. In this case, once a jack is removed from the deck, the next draw is less likely to be a jack and more likely to be some other card. However, if the jack is returned to the deck, and the deck is thoroughly reshuffled, a jack is as likely to be drawn as any other card. The same applies in any other process where objects are selected independently, and none are removed after each event, such as the roll of a die, a coin toss, or most lottery number selection schemes. Truly random processes such as these do not have memory, which makes it impossible for past outcomes to affect future outcomes. In fact, there is no finite number of trials that can guarantee a success.  A number is \\"cursed\\" or \\"blessed\\"  In a random sequence of numbers, a number may be said to be cursed because it has come up less often in the past, and so it is thought that it will occur less often in the future. A number may be assumed to be blessed because it has occurred more often than others in the past, and so it is thought likely to come up more often in the future. This logic is valid only if the randomisation is biased, for example with a loaded die. If the die is fair, then previous rolls can give no indication of future events. In nature, events rarely occur with perfectly equal frequency, so observing outcomes to determine which events are more probable makes sense. However, it is fallacious to apply this logic to systems designed to make all outcomes equally likely, such as shuffled cards, dice, and roulette wheels.  Odds are never dynamic  In the beginning of a scenario, one might calculate the probability of a certain event. However, as soon as one gains more information about the scenario, one may need to re-calculate the probability accordingly. In the Monty Hall problem, when the host reveals one door that contains a goat, this provides new information that needs to be factored into the calculation of probabilities. For example, when being told that a woman has two children, one might be interested in knowing if either of them is a girl, and if yes, what is probability that the other child is also a girl. Considering the two events independently, one might expect that the probability that the other child is female is ¬Ω (50%), but by building a probability space illustrating all possible outcomes, one would notice that the probability is actually only ‚Öì (33%). To be sure, the probability space does illustrate four ways of having these two children: boy-boy, girl-boy, boy-girl, and girl-girl. But once it is known that at least one of the children is female, this rules out the boy-boy scenario, leaving only three ways of have the two children: boy-girl, girl-boy, girl-girl. From this, it can be seen only ‚Öì of these scenarios would have the other child being also a girl(see Boy or girl paradox for more). In general, by using a probability space, one is less likely to miss out on possible scenarios, or to neglect the importance of new information. This technique can be used to provide insights in other situations such as the Monty Hall problem, a game show scenario in which a car is hidden behind one of three doors, and two goats are hidden as booby prizes behind the others. Once the contestant has chosen a door, the host opens one of the remaining doors to reveal a goat, eliminating that door as an option. With only two doors left (one with the car, the other with another goat), the player must decide to either keep their decision, or to switch and select the other door. Intuitively, one might think the player is choosing between two doors with equal probability, and that the opportunity to choose another door makes no difference. However, an analysis of the probability spaces would reveal that the contestant has received new information, and that changing to the other door would increase their chances of winning.

He was one of the limited group of actors who began their careers in the final period of English Renaissance theatre, and resumed stage work in the Restoration, after the long theatre closure of the English Civil War and the Interregnum, 1642‚Äì1660. [See: Richard Baxter; Nicholas Burt; Walter Clun; Charles Hart; Michael Mohun; William Wintershall.] Biography Robert Shatterell was baptised on 10 November 1616 in the parish of St. Botolph, Aldgate. He started as a boy player; he was with Beeston's Boys in 1639. During the Civil War, like fellow actors Hart and Burt, he served as an officer in the elite cavalry regiment commanded by Prince Rupert.

He is the antagonist of those movies and Austin Powers' nemesis. He is a parody of James Bond villains, primarily Ernst Stavro Blofeld. Dr. Evil routinely hatches schemes to terrorize and take over the world, and is usually accompanied by \\"Number Two\\", a goon who fronts his evil corporation Virtucon Industries, his cat Mr. Bigglesworth and his sidekick Mini-Me, a dwarf clone of himself. Fictional background According to his own account in Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery, delivered in a group therapy session with his estranged son Scott, Dr. Evil's upbringing went as follows: In the second film, he went on the Jerry Springer show and declared that he'd once made a \\"marzipan voodoo effigy of the Fonz while in a coma after smoking some Bolivian prayer hash at Sammy Davis Jr.'s house\\", and that he's the \\"Princess of Canada\\". In the third Austin Powers film, Goldmember, Nigel Powers reveals that Dr. Evil is in fact Austin Powers' twin brother, Douglas (\\"Dougie\\") Powers. He explains that Douglas and Austin were separated as babies following a car explosion, and that he had thought that only Austin had survived. Dougie, supposedly raised by Belgians, says his home town is Bruges, situated in the Dutch-speaking Flemish Region of Belgium but claims to not know how to speak \\"freaky-deeky Dutch\\". He also supposedly attended the British Intelligence Academy with Austin (along with Basil Exposition and Number 2), and is angered that Austin won the \\"International Man of Mystery\\" award, while he, the academy's best student, was overlooked. In the first film, Dr. Evil is an internationally known criminal genius, cryogenically frozen in 1967 and reawakened in 1997. Like Austin Powers, he faces challenges in acclimating to the new period. He often places his little finger near his mouth, especially when excited or to emphasize a statement. The gesture seems to have been borrowed from Dr. Rex, a character in \\"Number 12 Looks Just Like You,\\" an episode of The Twilight Zone. Dr. Evil occasionally uses unnecessary air quotes around now-familiar technical terms such as \\"laser\\". The scar on his face is a reference to similar scars on early 20th century movie villains, such as several portrayed by Erich von Stroheim (as well as a homage to Donald Pleasence as Blofeld in You Only Live Twice). This type of scar is usually a remnant of Mensur fencing, an activity in which European student groups participate. Clearly a parody of a James Bond villain, Dr. Evil dislikes the honorific \\"Mr.\\" when applied to himself, and says: \\"I didn't spend six years in evil medical school to be called 'Mister'!\\" Dr. Evil also wears clothing with a strong resemblance to Julius No, played by Joseph Wiseman, from the film Dr. No, specifically gray Nehru jacket jumpsuits and similar anti- radiation suits. Some aspects, including some of his quotes and his henchman Random Task, parody elements from Goldfinger. While Dr. Evil is primarily a send-up of the 1960s Sean Connery-era Bond villains, the 1970s Roger Moore era also gets skewered: the interior of Dr. Evil's space station in The Spy Who Shagged Me resembles Hugo Drax's space station from Moonraker, and the film's title spoofs The Spy Who Loved Me. Entourage Dr. Evil employs a diverse and highly stereotypical group of minions. Frau Farbissina Perhaps closest to Dr. Evil is his assistant, Frau Farbissina, founder of the militant wing of The Salvation Army. (\\"Farbissina\\" is Yiddish for \\"embittered\\".) In the second film, Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me, after imbibing some of Austin Powers' mojo, Dr. Evil becomes temporarily irresistible to Frau Farbissina, who is portrayed as a lesbian. In Goldmember, Farbissina and Dr. Evil kiss while he is in prison; the purpose was to transfer a key to Evil so that he could escape. She is a parody of the characters Rosa Klebb in the James Bond movie From Russia with Love and Irma Bunt from On Her Majesty's Secret Service, and does not appear to age over time, which was used for comedic effect in the film. Dr. Evil meets the younger Number Two and comments: 'You look so healthy and youthful.' Farbissina's voice is heard offscreen, and Dr. Evil says: 'And Frau, you look so ...' as the audience sees that she has not changed, leading Dr. Evil to finish with '... ri-ght'. Scott Evil Dr. Evil has a strained relationship with his son Scott, even liquidating their therapy group over an accusation of insolence. Scott points out Dr. Evil's incompetence and immaturity, as well as obvious mistakes and flaws in his plans. Scott later grows more \\"evil\\" and momentarily gains his father's respect, especially after Scott provides him a pool filled with sharks with lasers on their heads. When Dr. Evil switches sides to help Austin save the world, Scott takes over as the head of the evil organization. Number Two Number Two leads Dr. Evil's industrial empire, Virtucon, and is primarily concerned with the financial aspects of world domination. In successive films, his schemes and ventures garner massive profits for Virtucon without straying very far into illegality. Dr. Evil claims that Number Two's strategies in bringing in legitimately-obtained income insult the \\"ideals\\" of an evil empire. Number Two is a parody of Emilio Largo from the James Bond film Thunderball, second-in-command of the SPECTRE terrorist organization. Mr. Bigglesworth Mr. Bigglesworth is a fictional cat belonging to Dr. Evil. He was originally similar to Blofeld's cat, a typical white Persian cat from the James Bond movie series. Having escaped with Dr. Evil in a cryonic capsule, he lost all his fur due to an error in the thawing process. Mr. Bigglesworth has subsequently become bald, played by a Sphynx cat, whilst Dr. Evil's miniature clone, Mini-Me, has a kitten named Mini Mr. Bigglesworth. In the third instalment of the franchise, Mr. Bigglesworth is only seen once. Fat Bastard Fat Bastard is a morbidly obese henchman hailing from Scotland, said to weigh a metric ton. His extreme size endows Fat Bastard with super-human strength, as exhibited by his prowess in the Sumo ring from Goldmember. Fat Bastard is noted for his foul temper, frequent flatulence, vulgar manners and cannibalism. Fat Bastard reappears at the end of Austin Powers in Goldmember, having lost most of his girth, claiming he lost \\"180 lbs\\" and attributing the loss to the \\"Subway diet\\". Random Task Dr. Evil's handyman extraordinaire is Random Task, an ex-wrestler whose personality and assassination style parody those of Oddjob from Goldfinger, except that he throws his shoe instead of his hat. His names themselves are synonyms of 'odd' and 'job'. Task repetitively cracks his neck and it is often his job to move dead bodies away silently and to move Dr. Evil's chair. Paddy O'Brien Paddy O'Brien is an ex-assassin who is extremely superstitious, leaving a keepsake from his good-luck charm bracelet on the body of every victim he kills. Apparently Scotland Yard has been trying to recover that bracelet for some time. O'Brien attempts to assassinate Austin by choking him with his bracelet in the bathroom stall, but Austin drowns him in a parody of a scene in the Woody Allen movie \\"What's Up Tiger Lily.\\" He is a parody of Donald \\"Red\\" Grant from the 007 film \\"From Russia With Love.\\" Mustafa Mustafa, another assistant, designs the cryogenic freezing process that preserves Dr. Evil for 30 years. In 1969, two years after the early Dr. Evil was frozen, Mustafa is caught by the early Austin Powers, who had followed '90s Dr. Evil through time, and is forced to answer questions on the location of Dr. Evil's hideout. He feels compelled to answer any question that is posed to him three times. Silenced by Mini-Me before he can reveal his boss's location, he falls down a cliff but survives. Later he ensures that Dr. Evil is thawed out, and survives several attempts to kill him. Mini-Me The second film introduces Dr. Evil's clone, Mini-Me, who is \\"one-eighth his size but twice as evil.\\" Dr. Evil considers him more of a real son than Scott, provoking the latter's jealousy. Mini-Me later joins Austin to become a miniature version of him. As revealed by Myers in the audio commentary for the 2nd film, Mini-Me is a parody of the character Majai, from the film The Island of Dr. Moreau, as played by Nelson de la Rosa, whose sole purpose in that film is to follow Marlon Brando's Dr. Moreau character and copy his every move, dressing identically to Brando. Majai never speaks in the film, and similarly, Mini-Me does not speak either. Other assistants In the opening few minutes of the first film, Dr. Evil has four associates, namely Jurgen (a doctor), Generalissimo (a dictator), Rita (a meter maid), and Don Luigi (a mob boss with a hook for a hand, with a cigar speared on it), all executed because of their failure to kill Austin Powers. In The Spy Who Shagged Me, Vanessa Kensington portrays one of Dr. Evil's female robots, sent by him as a wedding gift for Austin. Secret lairs The Space Needle in Seattle Parodying the many Bond villains, Dr. Evil inhabits a sequence of elaborate lairs. In Austin Powers: International Man Of Mystery, Dr. Evil's first lair is underground in the Nevada desert, \\"somewhere outside Las Vegas\\"; which are obvious homages to You Only Live Twice and Diamonds Are Forever. In Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me Dr. Evil's lair is atop the Space Needle in Seattle, portrayed as the Starbucks headquarters; later, it is in a Caribbean island volcano with Dr. Evil's face carved into it on a Caribbean island (a homage to both You Only Live Twice and Live and Let Die), and then on the moon (the film's final villainous homage, to Moonraker). For the third film, Austin Powers In Goldmember, Dr. Evil has a new lair behind the famous Hollywood Sign and a submarine lair, shaped like himself (an homage to Karl Stromberg's Liparus tanker in The Spy Who Loved Me). Schemes Dr. Evil's projects for world domination are often named after post-1960s pop culture trademarks (Death Star, The Alan Parsons Project, Preparation H), and he is often unaware of the accidental pun due to having been frozen for thirty years. For example, when Dr. Evil says he will turn the moon into a \\"Death Star\\" (said with finger quotes), Scott laughs and calls him \\"Darth\\". Some of his threats are exaggerated, as when he makes his threat of causing all the world's volcanoes to erupt at once but only displays his machinery, something of an homage to Thunderball. When he makes the threat of \\"Death Star\\", he \\"demonstrates\\" the power of his laser by showing the President and the cabinet footage of the White House being destroyed, before admitting it was just footage from the movie Independence Day. \\"The real laser would be a lot like that\\", he lamely concludes. Dr. Evil seems to have a problem in general with understanding money, especially regarding inflation, variously threatening to hold the world ransom for $1 million and $100 billion, provoking laughter at the suggested sum being perceived as being either picayune or unrealistically large. Other idiotic schemes include a threat to destroy the ozone layer and make a scandal of Prince Charles' marriage, unaware that these were already issues that commanded popular attention. He expresses disappointment when endangered- species legislation prevents him from getting laser-beam-equipped sharks but finally settles on mutated sea bass. As with Auric Goldfinger, he creates models of his plans, worried that they are too complicated for his minions to understand. He also cares nothing for the companies (Virtucon, Starbucks, Hollywood Talent Agency) that fund his plans, ignoring all suggestions from Number Two on how to increase the profit of such companies. In television Myers later revived the Dr. Evil character for a brief appearance on the December 20, 2014 episode of Saturday Night Live, a show on which Myers had previously had a regular role. During the sketch, Dr. Evil lampooned North Korea and Sony Pictures on their spat over The Interview. Myers once again revived the character for a brief appearance on a 2018 episode of The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon in a sketch where Dr. Evil has been fired from President Trump's cabinet, and again on Election Day to announce his run for Congress. Some of Dr. Evil's facial and vocal expressions are allegedly patterned after Lorne Michaels, producer of television's Saturday Night Live, where Myers worked for a number of years. Most notably, Dr. Evil's statement \\"throw me a frickin' bone here, people,\\" was supposedly uttered frequently by Michaels at script meetings for SNL. As Dr. Evil, Myers occasionally affects an Ontario accent, reflecting his (and Michaels's) upbringing.

Qwest provided local service in 14 western and midwestern U.S. states: Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming. On April 22, 2010, CenturyLink announced it would acquire Qwest in a stock transaction. The merger closed on April 1, 2011. Qwest began doing business as CenturyLink in August 2011. Qwest provided voice, Internet backbone data services, and digital television in some areas. It operated in three segments: Wireline Services, Wireless Services, and Other Services. The Wireline Services segment provided local voice, long-distance voice, and data and Internet (DSL) services to consumers, businesses, and wholesale customers, as well as access services to wholesale customers. The Wireless Services segment was achieved by a partnership with Verizon Wireless. Qwest also partnered with DirecTV to provide digital television service to its customers. In Phoenix, Denver, Salt Lake City, Boise, and Omaha, Qwest offered Qwest Choice TV (later also known as Qwest Digital Television), an IPTV service over DSL. This service was retired in October 2008 (after being no longer available to new customers in May 2008), leaving DirecTV as the only TV service Qwest provided. Qwest Choice TV customers were moved to DirecTV. The Other Services segment primarily involved the sublease of real estate assets, such as space in office buildings, warehouses, and other properties. Qwest Communications also provided long-distance services and broadband data, as well as voice and video communications globally. The company sold its products and services to small businesses, governmental entities, and public and private educational institutions through various channels, including direct-sales marketing, telemarketing, arrangements with third-party agents, company's Web site, and partnership relations. As of September 13, 2005, Qwest had 98 retail stores in 14 states. Qwest Communications was headquartered in Denver, Colorado at 1801 California Street, in the second tallest building in Denver at 53 stories. The majority of Qwest occupational or non-management employees were represented by two labor unions; the Communications Workers of America and in Montana, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. Qwest also had software development centers in Bangalore and Noida (New Delhi), India called Qwest Software Services. History Founding Founded in 1996 by Philip Anschutz, Qwest began in an unconventional way. Anschutz, who owned the Southern Pacific Railroad at the time, established the subsidiary Southern Pacific Telecommunications Company and began installing the first all-digital, fiber-optic infrastructure along his railroad lines and connecting them into central junctions in strategic locations to serve businesses with high-speed data and T1 services. In 1997, the Southern Pacific Railroad was merged into the Union Pacific, in which Qwest gained access to UP's railroad lines to lay fiber-optic cable for its telecom network. At that time Anschutz had a contract with MCI to lay nationwide fiber for them along the railway lines; he took advantage of this situation and laid his own fiber along with that of MCI. In 1995, SP Telecom moved from San Francisco to Denver after acquiring Dallas-based Qwest Communications Corp., a digital microwave system owner, taking over its name and facilities. The Qwest headquarters were at 555 17th Street. Qwest Communications grew aggressively, acquiring internet service provider SuperNet in 1997, followed by the acquisition of LCI, a low cost long-distance carrier (located in Dublin, Ohio and McLean, Virginia) in 1998, and followed again by the acquisition of Icon CMT, a web hosting provider, also in 1998. This launched Qwest as not only a provider of high speed data to the niche market of corporate customers, but also a quick-growing residential and business long-distance customer base that it quickly merged into its data service. US West acquisition USWEST Corporate Logo, 1984‚Äì2000 Qwest merged with \\"Baby Bell\\" US West on June 30, 2000 through an apparent hostile takeover. Philip Anschutz owned 17.5% of the resulting company. Unlike prior merger transactions between the Baby Bells, in which the acquired entities survived as subsidiaries of SBC Communications and Bell Atlantic, US WEST ceased to exist when it was immediately absorbed into Qwest with all subsidiaries of US WEST becoming directly owned by Qwest. As a condition of the merger, Qwest was required to sell off its long-distance operations in the 14-state boundary in which it provided local telephone services. They were eventually sold to Touch America. In 2003, Qwest acquired Touch America from 360networks after Touch America filed for bankruptcy. The acquisition ended ongoing disputes between the two companies in which Touch America alleged Qwest continued to illegally sell long-distance services within the former US WEST region. Directory operations sale In 2002, Qwest agreed to sell its directory operations, QwestDex, to private equity firms The Carlyle Group and Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe for $7 billion. The sale allowed Qwest to generate cash to fend off a bankruptcy filing to which it may have had to resort due to significant amounts of debt it had incurred since the collapse of the dot-com bubble. The resulting company was named Dex Media, when the sale was completed in 2004. Alliances Qwest Communications has partnered with other major communications companies during its history. In Europe, Qwest partnered with the Dutch national telecom operator KPN to create the pan- European data communications and hosting company KPNQwest. KPNQwest was formed in November 1998 and went on to launch an initial public offering on the Nasdaq and Amsterdam stock Exchanges in November 1999. KPNQwest collapsed in bankruptcy in 2002. In the US, Qwest partnered with AT&T; and Verizon to form Movearoo.com. Created on July 9, 2008, the website is a program designed to help customers in the process of moving find home service providers available in their area. Problems Customer complaints and consumer issues One of the historically significant mass complaints regarding Qwest involved allegations that the then-long-distance-only company switched local telephone service customers over to Qwest's long-distance service without their permission, an illegal practice known as slamming. In July 2000, Qwest paid a $1.5 million fine to the Federal Communications Commission to resolve slamming complaints. In April 2001, they paid a $350,000 fine to the Pennsylvania Bureau of Consumer Protection after the state cited them for deceptive advertising and slamming practices. The company's settlements included a requirement that all of its sales employees sign a pledge stating that slamming was barred and a condition for dismissal from Qwest employment. Accounting and insider trading irregularities The company was also involved in accounting scandals, and was fined $250 million by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), to be split into two $125 million payments due to the poor state of Qwest's current financial health. Among the transactions in question were a series of deals from 1999 to 2001 with Enron's broadband division which may have helped Enron conceal losses. In 2005, former Chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) Joseph Nacchio, former President and chief operating officer (COO) Afshin Mohebbi and seven other former Qwest employees were accused of fraud in a civil lawsuit filed by the SEC. Separately, Nacchio was convicted of 19 counts of insider trading in Qwest stock on April 19, 2007. On March 31, 2011 US Federal Judge Marcia Krieger issued a summary judgement rejecting all SEC's claims against Afshin Mohebbi and ruling in his favor. Qwest's slogan from 1998-2002 was \\"Ride The Light\\", which was meant to portray the company as technologically advanced. In October 2002, Richard C. Notebaert, who took over as CEO in June of that year, introduced the \\"Spirit of Service\\" campaign which promotes the company as being refocused on customer satisfaction. This slogan was in use until October 2008. In 2004, Qwest became the first Regional Bell operating company (RBOC) in the United States to offer Standalone DSL (also known as Naked DSL), i.e. DSL Internet service that does not require the customer to have local landline phone service.  Refusal of NSA surveillance requests  In May 2006, USA Today reported that millions of telephone calling records had been handed over to the United States National Security Agency by AT&T; Corp., Verizon, and BellSouth since September 11, 2001. This data has been used to create a database of all international and domestic calls. Qwest was allegedly the lone holdout, despite threats from the NSA that their refusal to cooperate may jeopardize future government contracts, a decision which has earned them praise from those who oppose the NSA program. In the case of ACLU v. NSA, U.S. District Judge Anna Diggs Taylor on August 17, 2006 ruled that the government's domestic eavesdropping program is unconstitutional and ordered it ended immediately. The Bush Administration filed an appeal in the case, and Judge Taylor's decision was overturned by the appeals court. Former Qwest CEO Joseph Nacchio, alleged in appeal documents that the NSA requested that Qwest participate in its wiretapping program more than six months before September 11, 2001. Nacchio recalls the meeting as occurring on February 27, 2001. Nacchio further claims that the NSA cancelled a lucrative contract with Qwest as a result of Qwest's refusal to participate in the wiretapping program. Nacchio surrendered April 14, 2009 to a federal prison camp in Schuylkill, Pennsylvania to begin serving a six-year sentence for an insider trading conviction. The United States Supreme Court denied bail pending appeal the same day. A social media experiment and website covering the Qwest holdout, \\"Thank you Qwest dot Org\\" built by Netherlands-based webmaster Richard Kastelein and American expatriate journalist Chris Floyd, was covered by the CNN Situation Room, USA Today, New York Times, International Herald Tribune, Denver Post, News.com, and the Salt Lake Tribune.  Merger with CenturyLink  On April 22, 2010, CenturyLink announced it would acquire Qwest in a 0.1664 shares of CenturyLink common stock for each share of Qwest common stock transaction. CenturyLink shareholders will hold a 50.5% share of ownership in the combined company, while Qwest shareholders would own the remaining 49.5%. The valuation of CenturyLink's purchase as of April 21, 2010 is $22.4 billion, including the assumption of $11.8 billion of outstanding debt held by Qwest as of December 31, 2009. Qwest has started to do business as CenturyLink from August 8, 2011. Corporate structure The Qwest corporate headquarters in Denver. Qwest Communications International, Inc. was the holding company. It is the parent company of many more entities, but those listed below were the main operating units: * Qwest Corporation was an incumbent local exchange carrier (ILEC), and since it was part of the AT&T; Bell Operating System as Mountain Bell, it is also a Bell Operating Company. Qwest Corporation serves an in-region local market which consists of the 14 states in which the pre- merger U S WEST provided local telephone service. Qwest Corporation also provides administrative and operation services such as financial, human resources, IT, and legal to the Qwest family of companies‚Äîthe Qwest affiliates. It also owns El Paso County Telephone. * Qwest L D Corp. was a subsidiary providing long-distance calling services within the Qwest Corporation operating boundaries. * Qwest Communications Company, LLC was an affiliate of Qwest that can provide local services but currently provides long-distance telephone and long-haul data services. It was the classic pre U S WEST merger entity founded in 1966 as Southern Pacific Telecommunications Company. Qwest Communications Corporation changed its name and corporate status on January 2, 2009, to a limited liability company. Qwest Communications made an agreement with CSX in which it could use its rail lines as a right-of-way for a fiber-optic system. Qwest Communications International, the holding company, took the slogan Ride the Light as a result of this. Defunct entities Malheur Home Telephone Company: Commonly known as Malheur Bell, it was merged into its corporate parent Qwest Corporation on December 14, 2009. Qwest Interprise America: Merged into Qwest Service Corporation in 2007 then moved to Qwest Communications Company, LLC. Qwest Services Corporation: While still a legal entity, it previously supplied the administrative and operation services Qwest Corporation currently provides. Qwest Cyber.Solutions: Operated as an application service provider (ASP) in the late 1990s and early 2000s (decade) hosting, managing and integrating complex software offerings such as SAP, Oracle and JD Edwards. U S WEST, Inc.: The Regional Bell Operating Company it acquired in 2000. It was legally merged into Qwest on June 30, 2000.

Life He was born on November 10, 1810 in Bennington, Vermont, and was a direct descendant of Kenelm Winslow, brother of Edward Winslow, a Mayflower colonist and a governor of Plymouth Colony. John Winslow worked as a clerk in a commission house until he was 21. In 1831, he joined the New Jersey Iron Company as a manager in the Boston office. In 1933 (1833?), he started his own business, making pig iron in Bergen and Sussex counties in New Jersey. In 1837, he and Erastus Corning started a partnership to produce iron. Their partnership lasted for about thirty years. They owned the Rensselaer Iron Works and the Albany Iron Works, which were the largest producers of iron in the United States. When Corning gained control of the Lulworth Iron company in Mount Savage, Maryland, he made Winslow the President. In 1863, they sent Alexander Lyman Holley to learn more about the Bessemer process and they also obtained the US rights to the Bessemer patents. They started the production of Bessemer steel in 1865. In the 1860 presidential election, Winslow was a presidential elector and voted for Abraham Lincoln and Hannibal Hamlin. Starting in 1861, Winslow and his business partner John Griswold worked with John Ericsson to build the USS Monitor. After the naval board had not approved Ericsson's proposal for the ironclad warship, Griswold and Winslow met with President Lincoln personally to advocate for its construction. Lincoln then arranged a meeting with them in the office of the Secretary of the Navy. During subsequent meetings, the Navy resisted the project but finally approved but without funding on October 4, 1861. Largely out of frustration, Winslow arranged to finance the project himself, at a cost of $275,000. After the signing of the contract, construction began rapidly. Interim reimbursements were made by the Navy during construction but by the time of the battle the final payments had not been made. Therefore, the Monitor remained the property of the de facto lien holder, John Flack Winslow. Some of the iron for the Monitor was produced at the Albany Iron Works in Troy. The ship was launched 101 days from the signing of the contract, in time to defend the Union blockade during the Battle of Hampton Roads. Along with John Ericsson, Griswold and Winslow received much praise for their efforts in producing the Monitor. They also received contracts for additional ironclad warships. In 1865, he was appointed president of Rensselaer. He continued in this position until 1868. Unlike the previous university presidents, he did not have a background as a pastor. He was also a director of several banks and the director and president of the Poughkeepsie and Eastern Railroad. The Winslow Chemical Laboratory, built in 1866, was named in honor of his donation of half the construction cost and his enterprise on behalf of the Institute. The building was added to the US National Register of Historic Places in 1994. Winslow died on March 10, 1892 in Poughkeepsie, New York, United States. Wood Cliff The \\"Wood Cliff\\" estate just north of Poughkeepsie, comprised about thirty acres of Lot No. 1 of the Great Nine Partners patent, and was originally a part of the farm of Roderick C. Andrus. In 1840 it was transferred to Henry S. Richards, and later was purchased by Edward Crosby, son of William B. Crosby of New York. Mr. Crosby tore down the old house and built a new one. He married Miss Elizabeth Van Schoonhoven of Troy, and they occupied the property for many years. June 10, 1867, it was purchased by the John Flack Winslow, who remodeled the house, laid out the gardens and greatly improved the estate. He resided at \\"Wood Cliff\\" until his death in 1892. It was the home of Mrs. Harriet Wickes Winslow. In 1927 \\"Wood Cliff\\" was purchased by real estate developer, who erected Woodcliff Pleasure Park. The amusement park, which operated from 1927 to 1941 included among other attractions, a roller coaster, ballroom, and dock for the dayliner. The Winslow mansion became an inn. The park began to decline during the depression. The property is now the northernmost part of Marist College. References Sources * Nason, Henry B., ed.

In the modern language of Bass‚ÄìSerre theory the theorem says that a finitely generated group G has more than one end if and only if G admits a nontrivial (that is, without a global fixed point) action on a simplicial tree with finite edge-stabilizers and without edge-inversions. The theorem was proved by John R. Stallings, first in the torsion-free case (1968)John R. Stallings. On torsion-free groups with infinitely many ends. Annals of Mathematics (2), vol. 88 (1968), pp. 312-334 and then in the general case (1971).John Stallings. Group theory and three-dimensional manifolds. A James K. Whittemore Lecture in Mathematics given at Yale University, 1969. Yale Mathematical Monographs, 4. Yale University Press, New Haven, Conn.-London, 1971. Ends of graphs Let Œì be a connected graph where the degree of every vertex is finite. One can view Œì as a topological space by giving it the natural structure of a one-dimensional cell complex. Then the ends of Œì are the ends of this topological space. A more explicit definition of the number of ends of a graph is presented below for completeness. Let n ‚â• 0 be a non-negative integer. The graph Œì is said to satisfy e(Œì) ‚â§ n if for every finite collection F of edges of Œì the graph Œì ‚àí F has at most n infinite connected components. By definition, e(Œì) = m if e(Œì) ‚â§ m and if for every 0 ‚â§ n < m the statement e(Œì) ‚â§ n is false. Thus e(Œì) = m if m is the smallest nonnegative integer n such that e(Œì) ‚â§ n. If there does not exist an integer n ‚â• 0 such that e(Œì) ‚â§ n, put e(Œì) = ‚àû. The number e(Œì) is called the number of ends of Œì. Informally, e(Œì) is the number of \\"connected components at infinity\\" of Œì. If e(Œì) = m < ‚àû, then for any finite set F of edges of Œì there exists a finite set K of edges of Œì with F ‚äÜ K such that Œì ‚àí F has exactly m infinite connected components. If e(Œì) = ‚àû, then for any finite set F of edges of Œì and for any integer n ‚â• 0 there exists a finite set K of edges of Œì with F ‚äÜ K such that Œì ‚àí K has at least n infinite connected components. Ends of groups Let G be a finitely generated group. Let S ‚äÜ G be a finite generating set of G and let Œì(G, S) be the Cayley graph of G with respect to S. The number of ends of G is defined as e(G) = e(Œì(G, S)). A basic fact in the theory of ends of groups says that e(Œì(G, S)) does not depend on the choice of a finite generating set S of G, so that e(G) is well-defined.

Comment. Math. Helv. 16, (1944). 81-100 established in the 1940s the following two facts: *For any finitely generated group G we have e(G) ‚àà {0, 1, 2, ‚àû}. *For any finitely generated group G we have e(G) = 2 if and only if G is virtually infinite cyclic (that is, G contains an infinite cyclic subgroup of finite index). Charles T. C. Wall proved in 1967 the following complementary factLemma 4.1 in C. T. C. Wall, Poincar√© Complexes: I. Annals of Mathematics, Second Series, Vol. 86, No. 2 (Sep., 1967), pp. 213-245: *A group G is virtually infinite cyclic if and only if it has a finite normal subgroup W such that G/W is either infinite cyclic or infinite dihedral. Cuts and almost invariant sets Let G be a finitely generated group, S ‚äÜ G be a finite generating set of G and let Œì = Œì(G, S) be the Cayley graph of G with respect to S. For a subset A ‚äÜ G denote by A‚àó the complement G ‚àí A of A in G. For a subset A ‚äÜ G, the edge boundary or the co- boundary Œ¥A of A consists of all (topological) edges of Œì connecting a vertex from A with a vertex from A‚àó. Note that by definition Œ¥A = Œ¥A‚àó. An ordered pair (A, A‚àó) is called a cut in Œì if Œ¥A is finite. A cut (A,A‚àó) is called essential if both the sets A and A‚àó are infinite. A subset A ‚äÜ G is called almost invariant if for every g‚ààG the symmetric difference between A and Ag is finite. It is easy to see that (A, A‚àó) is a cut if and only if the sets A and A‚àó are almost invariant (equivalently, if and only if the set A is almost invariant). =Cuts and ends= A simple but important observation states: :e(G) > 1 if and only if there exists at least one essential cut (A,A‚àó) in Œì. =Cuts and splittings over finite groups= If G = H‚àóK where H and K are nontrivial finitely generated groups then the Cayley graph of G has at least one essential cut and hence e(G) > 1. Indeed, let X and Y be finite generating sets for H and K accordingly so that S = X ‚à™ Y is a finite generating set for G and let Œì=Œì(G,S) be the Cayley graph of G with respect to S. Let A consist of the trivial element and all the elements of G whose normal form expressions for G = H‚àóK starts with a nontrivial element of H. Thus A‚àó consists of all elements of G whose normal form expressions for G = H‚àóK starts with a nontrivial element of K. It is not hard to see that (A,A‚àó) is an essential cut in Œì so that e(G) > 1. A more precise version of this argument shows that for a finitely generated group G: *If G = H‚àóCK is a free product with amalgamation where C is a finite group such that C ‚â† H and C ‚â† K then H and K are finitely generated and e(G) > 1 . *If \\\\scriptstyle G=\\\\langle H, t t^{-1}C_1t=C_2\\\\rangle is an HNN-extension where C1, C2 are isomorphic finite subgroups of H then G is a finitely generated group and e(G) > 1. Stallings' theorem shows that the converse is also true. Formal statement of Stallings' theorem Let G be a finitely generated group. Then e(G) > 1 if and only if one of the following holds: *The group G admits a splitting G=H‚àóCK as a free product with amalgamation where C is a finite group such that C ‚â† H and C ‚â† K. *The group G is an HNN extension \\\\scriptstyle G=\\\\langle H, t t^{-1}C_1t=C_2\\\\rangle where and C1, C2 are isomorphic finite subgroups of H. In the language of Bass‚ÄìSerre theory this result can be restated as follows: For a finitely generated group G we have e(G) > 1 if and only if G admits a nontrivial (that is, without a global fixed vertex) action on a simplicial tree with finite edge-stabilizers and without edge-inversions. For the case where G is a torsion-free finitely generated group, Stallings' theorem implies that e(G) = ‚àû if and only if G admits a proper free product decomposition G = A‚àóB with both A and B nontrivial. Applications and generalizations *Among the immediate applications of Stallings' theorem was a proof by StallingsJohn R. Stallings. Groups of dimension 1 are locally free. Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society, vol. 74 (1968), pp. 361-364 of a long-standing conjecture that every finitely generated group of cohomological dimension one is free and that every torsion-free virtually free group is free. *Stallings' theorem also implies that the property of having a nontrivial splitting over a finite subgroup is a quasi-isometry invariant of a finitely generated group since the number of ends of a finitely generated group is easily seen to be a quasi-isometry invariant. For this reason Stallings' theorem is considered to be one of the first results in geometric group theory. *Stallings' theorem was a starting point for Dunwoody's accessibility theory. A finitely generated group G is said to be accessible if the process of iterated nontrivial splitting of G over finite subgroups always terminates in a finite number of steps. In Bass‚ÄìSerre theory terms that the number of edges in a reduced splitting of G as the fundamental group of a graph of groups with finite edge groups is bounded by some constant depending on G.

Journal of Pure and Applied Algebra, vol. 30 (1983), no. 1, pp. 39-46. showed that if one bounds the size of finite subgroups over which the splittings are taken then every finitely generated group is accessible in this sense as well. These results in turn gave rise to other versions of accessibility such as Bestvina-Feighn accessibilityM. Bestvina and M. Feighn. Bounding the complexity of simplicial group actions on trees.

Topology, vol. 40 (2001), no. 3, pp. 617-629 and others. *Stallings' theorem is a key tool in proving that a finitely generated group G is virtually free if and only if G can be represented as the fundamental group of a finite graph of groups where all vertex and edge groups are finite (see, for example,H. Bass. Covering theory for graphs of groups. Journal of Pure and Applied Algebra, vol. 89 (1993), no. 1-2, pp. 3-47). *Using Dunwoody's accessibility result, Stallings' theorem about ends of groups and the fact that if G is a finitely presented group with asymptotic dimension 1 then G is virtually free one can show that for a finitely presented word-hyperbolic group G the hyperbolic boundary of G has topological dimension zero if and only if G is virtually free. *Relative versions of Stallings' theorem and relative ends of finitely generated groups with respect to subgroups have also been considered. For a subgroup H‚â§G of a finitely generated group G one defines the number of relative ends e(G,H) as the number of ends of the relative Cayley graph (the Schreier coset graph) of G with respect to H. The case where e(G,H)>1 is called a semi-splitting of G over H. Early work on semi-splittings, inspired by Stallings' theorem, was done in the 1970s and 1980s by Scott,Peter Scott.

Mat., Novosibirsk, 1997 in the 1990s showed that for a subgroup H‚â§G the condition e(G,H)>1 corresponds to the group G admitting an essential isometric action on a CAT(0)-cubing where a subgroup commensurable with H stabilizes an essential \\"hyperplane\\" (a simplicial tree is an example of a CAT(0)-cubing where the hyperplanes are the midpoints of edges). In certain situations such a semi-splitting can be promoted to an actual algebraic splitting, typically over a subgroup commensurable with H, such as for the case where H is finite (Stallings' theorem). Another situation where an actual splitting can be obtained (modulo a few exceptions) is for semi-splittings over virtually polycyclic subgroups. Here the case of semi-splittings of word-hyperbolic groups over two-ended (virtually infinite cyclic) subgroups was treated by Scott-SwarupG. P. Scott, and G. A. Swarup. An algebraic annulus theorem.

Dunwoody. Cutting up graphs. Combinatorica, vol. 2 (1982), no. 1, pp. 15-23 based on the ideas of edge-cuts. Later Dunwoody also gave a proof of Stallings' theorem for finitely presented groups using the method of \\"tracks\\" on finite 2-complexes. Niblo obtained a proofGraham A. Niblo. A geometric proof of Stallings' theorem on groups with more than one end. Geometriae Dedicata, vol. 105 (2004), pp. 61-76 of Stallings' theorem as a consequence of Sageev's CAT(0)-cubing relative version, where the CAT(0)-cubing is eventually promoted to being a tree. Niblo's paper also defines an abstract group- theoretic obstruction (which is a union of double cosets of H in G) for obtaining an actual splitting from a semi-splitting. It is also possible to prove Stallings' theorem for finitely presented groups using Riemannian geometry techniques of minimal surfaces, where one first realizes a finitely presented group as the fundamental group of a compact 4-manifold (see, for example, a sketch of this argument in the survey article of WallC. T. C. Wall. The geometry of abstract groups and their splittings. Revista Matem√°tica Complutense vol. 16(2003), no. 1, pp. 5-101). Gromov outlined a proof (see pp. 228‚Äì230 in M. Gromov, Hyperbolic Groups, in \\"Essays in Group Theory\\" (G. M. Gersten, ed.), MSRI Publ. 8, 1987, pp. 75-263) where the minimal surfaces argument is replaced by an easier harmonic analysis argument and this approach was pushed further by Kapovich to cover the original case of finitely generated groups.Gentimis Thanos, Asymptotic dimension of finitely presented groups, http://www.ams.org/journals/proc/2008-136-12/S0002-9939-08-08973-9/home.htmlM.

Background  It is not known when Xiao Hua was born. He was from one of the most prominent families of Tang Dynasty officialdom, having descended from the imperial clan of the Liang Dynasty, and his father Xiao Song was a prominent chancellor and general during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong.New Book of Tang, vol. 71. Xiao Hua's brother Xiao Heng (Ëï≠Ë°°) married Emperor Xuanzong's daughter Princess Xinchang.  During Emperor Xuanzong's reign  In 733, when Xiao Song was removed as chancellor (although still remaining as a high-ranked official) in the midst of his conflict with fellow chancellor Han Xiu (who was also removed as a result), Xiao Hua was made an imperial attendant (Áµ¶‰∫ã‰∏≠, Jishizhong), and was soon promoted to be the deputy minister of public works (Â∑•ÈÉ®‰æçÈÉé, Gongbu Shilang). After Xiao Song died in 749, Xiao Hua inherited the title of Duke of Xu. Toward the end of Emperor Xuanzong's Tianbao era (742-756), Xiao Hua was made the deputy minister of defense (ÂÖµÈÉ®‰æçÈÉé, Bingbu Shilang). In 755, the general An Lushan rebelled at Fanyang Circuit (ËåÉÈôΩ, headquartered in modern Beijing), and soon established a state of Yan with him as emperor. In 756, with Yan forces approaching the Tang capital Chang'an, Emperor Xuanzong fled toward Chengdu. Most officials, including Xiao Hua, were unable to follow him, and Xiao Hua was captured by Yan forces. An made him the prefect of Wei Prefecture (È≠èÂ∑û, in modern Handan, Hebei).  During Emperor Suzong's reign  In 758, with Emperor Xuanzong's son Emperor Suzong then the emperor of Tang and An Lushan's son An Qingxu then the emperor of Yan, Tang forces recaptured Chang'an and Yan's capital Luoyang, forcing An Qingxu to flee to Yecheng, near Wei Prefecture. Nine Tang military governors (Jiedushi), led by Guo Ziyi, put Yecheng under siege. Xiao Hua sent secret correspondences to the Tang army agreeing to rise against Yan forces. His correspondences, however, were intercepted, and he was imprisoned. When the Tang general Cui Guangyuan (Â¥îÂÖâÈÅ†) captured Wei Prefecture, he freed Xiao. It was said that the people of Wei Prefecture favored Xiao's governance and petitioned Emperor Suzong to let Xiao remain at Wei Prefecture, and Emperor Suzong agreed. However, when the Yan general Shi Siming‚Äîwho briefly submitted to Tang but then turned against Tang again‚Äîadvanced south toward Yecheng from Fanyang, Guo was uncertain about Xiao's loyalty and so summoned him to the Tang army camps, replacing him with Cui. Soon, in a confrontation with Shi's forces, Tang forces collapsed, and in the aftermaths, Xiao went back to Chang'an. He was still considered tainted by his service as a Yan official, and he was demoted to be the acting Mishu Shaojian (ÁßòÊõ∏Â∞ëÁõ£) -- the deputy director of the Palace Library. He was soon promoted to be Shangshu You Cheng (Â∞öÊõ∏Âè≥‰∏û), one of the Secretaries General of the executive bureau of government (Â∞öÊõ∏ÁúÅ, Shangshu Sheng). In 759, he was made the mayor of Hezhong Municipality (Ê≤≥‰∏≠, in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi) as well as the military governor of Hezhong Circuit (headquartered in Hezhong Municipality). Around the new year 761, Xiao was recalled to Chang'an to serve as Zhongshu Shilang (‰∏≠Êõ∏‰æçÈÉé) -- the deputy head of the legislative bureau (‰∏≠Êõ∏ÁúÅ, Zhongshu Sheng). He was also given the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (Âêå‰∏≠Êõ∏ÈñÄ‰∏ãÂπ≥Á´†‰∫ã), making him a chancellor de facto. He was also made an imperial scholar at Chongwen Pavilion (Â¥áÊñáÈ§®) and put in charge of editing the imperial history. In 761, when the powerful eunuch Li Fuguo wanted to be chancellor, and Emperor Suzong, who by this point was fearful of Li Fuguo, refused on the basis that he did not have the support of the officials, Li Fuguo tried to persuade the senior official Pei Mian to recommend him. Emperor Suzong told Xiao that if an important official (i.e., someone like Pei) recommended Li Fuguo, he would no longer have the excuse to refuse Li Fuguo's request. When Xiao subsequently discussed this with Pei, Pei's response was: \\"Surely I will not do this. My arm can be cut off before he can be chancellor.\\" Subsequently, Li Fuguo was not able to be chancellor while Emperor Suzong was alive, much to Li Fuguo's resentment, and Li Fuguo believed Xiao to be responsible. In 762, Li Fuguo accused Xiao of being power hungry, and repeatedly requested Emperor Suzong to remove Xiao. Emperor Suzong, apprehensive of Li Fuguo, removed Xiao from his chancellor position and made him the minister of rites (Á¶ÆÈÉ®Â∞öÊõ∏, Libu Shangshu), replacing him with Yuan Zai, at Li Fuguo's recommendation.  During Emperor Daizong's reign  Emperor Suzong died shortly after, and he was succeeded by his son Emperor Daizong‚Äîwho took the throne after Li Fuguo prevailed in a bloody conflict with Emperor Suzong's wife Empress Zhang in which Empress Zhang and Emperor Daizong's brother Li Xi (Êùé‰øÇ) the Prince of Yue were killed. Li Fuguo was (briefly) completely in control, and Yuan Zai, in order to flatter him, accused Xiao of crimes. Xiao was demoted to be the military advisor to the prefect of Xia Prefecture (Â≥ΩÂ∑û, in modern Yichang, Hubei). He died while still at Xia Prefecture. His grandsons Xiao Mian and Xiao Fang later served as chancellors as well, during the reigns of Emperor Muzong and Emperor Xizong, respectively.

Early life and education Zakii was born in Johor Bahru, Johor in Malaysia. He is the youngest of 6 children. Zakii developed his love for art at the age of 6. He attended Ngee Heng Primary School from 1962 until 1967 and went to secondary school at English College Johore Bahru. After graduation, Zakii was accepted into the School of Art and Design, MARA Institute of Technology. Family Zakii's father, Tan Sri Haji Anwar bin Abdul Malik, was a politician. He was credited as the person who gave the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) its name ‚Äì initially United Malays Organization. This was at a meeting in Batu Pahat when seven UMNO founders from Johor Bahru met Datuk Onn Jaafar to call for a unification of the disparate Malay nationalist groups at the time. He later became Onn‚Äôs private secretary when Onn became Johor‚Äôs Chief Minister. Anwar's mother was Hajjah Saodah binti Abdullah, a housewife. Zakii has two elder sisters, Tan Sri Zarinah Anwar, who was the chairman of Securities Commission Malaysia and Zainah Anwar, prominent Malaysian non-governmental organisation leader and activist. She was the head of Sisters in Islam for more than twenty years before deciding to step down to give way to young blood to continue the fight for Muslim women's rights. Their father died in 1998, and their mother, Hajjah Saodah bte Abdullah, died the following year. Zakii is married with 4 children. Career The artist began his career as a graphic artist, producing some of the leading advertising graphics of his time. From there, he continued to establish his name by converting to fine art where his techniques have been exemplary and world class. Zakii came to attention for his virtuosity and command of a spectrum of media from charcoals to oils, building a reputation for stunning photo-realist still-life paintings and expressive portraits. Later, a more contemporary edge surfaced in his works as Zakii introduced urban subjects and settings into his canvases. He is lauded for capturing not just city motifs and urban features but also a distinctive psychological dimension and cinematic quality in these scenarios. Zakii's preoccupation with the spiritual or metaphysical aspects of urban life, as seen through his use of icons, symbols and allegories (including metaphors of theatre, performance and masks) have also marked his practice.

Thor offers investment vehicles for institutional investors through its Thor Urban Property Funds. Thor Equities also has several subsidiary companies including retail advisory and tenant representation firm Thor Retail Advisors. Background Thor Equities was founded in 1986 by President & CEO Joseph J. Sitt. His first investment was a property sold at tax auction on East Tremont Avenue in the Bronx, a chronically under served retail area, where he built a one-story retail structure with money from family and friends.\\"How I Did It: Joe Sitt, Thor Equities\\", Inc. Magazine, January 2006 He proceeded to secure national retailers Rite Aid Pharmacy and Payless Shoes after convincing them of the value of this location. \\"Joseph J. Sitt, 39\\", Crainsnewyork.com, 2004 Ashley Stewart Roxbury, Massachusetts From Sitt's early realization of the retail gap that left broad swathes of inner city consumers largely underserved by major retailers, he founded Ashley Stewart (a name inspired by Laura Ashley and Martha Stewart) in 1991. Ashley Stewart sold modern and fashionable clothing to women. Each Ashley Stewart store hired from within the community, and the company was recognized by President Clinton for its contribution to the Welfare-to-work program.‚ÄúAn Eye for Opportunity‚Äù, Stern Business, Spring/Summer 2008 Ashley Stewart quickly grew to over 380 stores in more than 100 cities, which prompted many national retailers to follow suit and helped change the urban retail landscape. Sitt was also part owner of the Children's Place kids clothing chain as well as Marianne Stores, a retail outlet specializing in clothing for Latina women. As business boomed, Sitt sold his interest in 2000 to concentrate on urban real estate through his company Thor Equities. In 2004, Sitt was profiled by Crains New York in its annual \\"40 Under 40\\" issue, which celebrates those individuals in New York City who have achieved success in business before turning 40.

Sitt has been seen as one of the market makers on Fifth Avenue, helping push retail growth further below the traditional southern border at 49th Street. Thor has also made significant investments in the Meatpacking District, betting on the area to continue its climb as a premier retail destination in Manhattan, driven in part by the High Line and arrival of the new Whitney Museum.

After the city changed its zoning to permit development of the site, Thor sold the site and development plan for $125 million to a financial company. Coney Island In 2005, the company bought a parcel of land west of the amusement district in Coney Island for $13 million, and sold it 14 months later for $90 million. Thor then reinvested in more land on Coney Island along Stillwell Avenue as well as some Boardwalk property including Astroland. In 2006, Thor announced plans for a $1.5 billion Las Vegas-style amusement park resort, which required several zoning changes.

Interim amusement rides and a flea market opened in the summer of 2009 and closed later that year. On November 11, 2009, Sitt reached a deal with New York City to sell part of his 12.5 acres (51,000 m2) of land in Coney Island for $95.6 million so that the city and Thor could jointly redevelop Coney Island, completing the three-year negotiation.

The name Ashley Stewart was inspired by Laura Ashley and Martha Stewart, who the company saw as icons of upscale Americana. The Secaucus, New Jersey-based company has 89 stores across 22 states. They sell a variety of apparel, ranging from jeans to dresses and shoes. In recent years the brand has made a comeback, after filing for bankruptcy in 2010 and 2014. History Ashley Stewart arose out of real estate investor Joseph Sitt's frustration in bringing retailers into the inner city New York neighborhoods where he was developing real estate projects. After hiring merchants to study the market, he found that the biggest gap was in upscale fashion for plus-sized urban career women, and decided to open retail stores himself. Roxbury, Massachusetts Ashley Stewart was founded in 1991, and quickly grew to over 380 stores in more than 100 cities, recording annual sales as high as US $400 million, which prompted many national retailers to follow suit, and helped change the urban retail landscape.‚ÄúAn Eye for Opportunity‚Äù, Stern Business, Spring/Summer 2008 In 1996 the TSG Capital Fund II made an initial investment of US$30 million in Ashley Stewart. The company focused on holding events like fashion shows instead of launching large advertising campaigns. They would often hold 300 to 350 fashion shows a year, which raised money for the communities they were in. Each Ashley Stewart store also hired from within the community, and the company was recognized by President Bill Clinton for its contribution to the Welfare-to-work program. Company Turnaround & Reinvention In 2000 Sitt sold the company, after which it was owned by multiple private equity firms - a group led by Trimaran Fund II bought the company in 2004, and in 2010 they were purchased by GB Merchant Partners. The company faced financial difficulties during this time period, and would eventually file for bankruptcy in 2010 and again in 2014. After the 2014 bankruptcy the company was owned by affiliates of Clearlake Capital and the FirePine Group. Despite their financial troubles, the company re-introduced a charitable giving program during the 2013 holiday season. In the face of the company's severe liquidity shortage, James Rhee, a member of the Ashley Stewart's board of directors, resigned from his position and assumed full-time operational leadership of Ashley Stewart as the company faced imminent liquidation. Rhee moved the headquarters into a smaller space without enclosed offices, putting an emphasis on developing a more egalitarian, friendly, open and collaborative corporate culture. He also went to the stores and talked to customers, while writing a new business plan for the company. Approximately 100 stores were closed during this time, while the production cycle was sped up, as to get fresh clothing into stores in four to six weeks. Rhee also put an emphasis on expanding online, increasing their use of email and SMS, and expanding their presence on social media. After Rhee became CEO the company's fortunes improved drastically, going from taking average losses of US$5‚Äì6 million a year (reaching a high of US$12 million annually) to bringing in profits of US $20 annually as of 2016. The company also eliminated its debt during this time. Inc.

Early life and education Sitt was born in 1964 near Coney Island, BrooklynInc Magazine: \\"How I Did It: Joe Sitt, Thor Equities\\", January 2006 and is of Spanish and Jewish descent. He began working at a young age in flea market booths at the Aqueduct and Roosevelt racetrack parking lots in the New York City area. At age 11, Sitt became interested in real estate when his only choice was to go to Manhattan to buy an Atari computer because he couldn't get one in Brooklyn. This eventually led Sitt to study business at New York University's Stern School of Business, and in 1986 he founded Thor Equities before graduating. Career Sitt picked the name Thor for the company because he was an avid Thor comic book fan and thought it would fit his \\"concept of being the protector of the cities.\\" His first investment was a property sold at tax auction on East Tremont Avenue in the Bronx, a chronically underserved retail area, where he built a one-story retail structure with money from \\"family, friends, roommates, parents of roommates.\\" He proceeded to secure national retailers Rite Aid Pharmacy, Payless Shoes, and Rainbow Shops.Crain's New York: \\"Joseph J.

As part of the transaction with Petrie Retail, Sitt acquired Marianne Stores, a retail outlet specializing in clothing for Latina women. As business boomed, Sitt sold his interest in 2000 to concentrate on urban real estate through his company Thor Equities.

Education By the age of eight, Hamilton began attending a boarding school in Trenton, New Jersey, where he joined his older brother Philip studying with William Frazer, an Episcopal clergyman and rector of St. Michael's Church. He later attended Columbia College in New York. According to historian Ron Chernow, he graduated from Columbia in 1804, several weeks after his father was killed in a duel with Aaron Burr. According to the St. Andrew's Society of New York, of which Hamilton was a member, Hamilton \\"did not graduate on account of an accident\\", but shortly afterward began the study of law. Career After college, Hamilton was invited to be an apprentice attorney in Stephen Higginson's Boston law firm, and was later admitted to practice law. He sailed to Spain in 1811 or 1812, during a period of political conflict preceding the War of 1812, and joined the Duke of Wellington's forces, then fighting against Napoleon's army in Portugal. After acquiring some military and strategic training with the British Army, Hamilton returned to America to serve in the War of 1812, receiving a commission as Captain of the 41st Regiment of Infantry in the United States Army in August 1813. The 41st Regiment did not appear to have seen active service in the war, and Hamilton went on to act as aide-de-camp to his father's friend General Morgan Lewis in 1814, serving until June 15, 1815. Hamilton resumed the practice of law, and took office in July 1818 as a member of the 42nd New York State Legislature for a one-year term, as one of eleven representatives to the New York State Assembly from New York City. In May 1822, President James Monroe appointed Hamilton as a United States Attorney for East Florida. In 1823, he was appointed to be one of three Land Commissioners for East Florida, and while there, he received the military rank of Colonel. He ran unsuccessfully against Richard K. Call to be the Florida Territory's delegate in the United States House of Representatives. Hamilton subsequently returned to New York, where he became successful in real estate transactions, and for many years was one of the leading names in Wall Street. In the mid-1830s, as a lawyer in the New York Court of Chancery, Hamilton represented Eliza Jumel against her husband Aaron Burr during two years of divorce proceedings, which were finalized in 1836 on the day of Burr's death. She and Burr had separated after only four months of marriage. Hamilton had a \\"large and varied correspondence\\" with other political contemporaries including his close friend Henry Clay, John C. Calhoun, Salmon P. Chase, and Presidents James Monroe and Zachary Taylor. Personal life In 1817, Hamilton married Eliza P. Knox (d. 1871), daughter of William Knox, who was at that time a leading merchant in New York City. In 1833, when his mother Eliza Hamilton was 76 years old, Hamilton used funds from his mother's sale of The Grange to purchase a townhouse for her and his family in New York City, at 4 St. Mark's Place (now known as the Hamilton-Holly House). Between 1833 and 1842, he and his wife lived there with his mother, his sister Eliza Hamilton Holly, and her husband Sidney Augustus Holly. During a trip through the West with his wife in 1835, Hamilton met Abraham Lincoln, then an Illinois state legislator, in a grocery store where Lincoln was \\"lying upon the counter in midday telling stories.\\" During the last ten years of his life, Hamilton resided in New Brunswick, New Jersey and in New York City, where he moved after the death of his wife in 1871. Hamilton died, having had no children, on August 2, 1875, at his home, 83 Clinton Place, in Greenwich Village.

Martin is also credited with developing a system of reinforced concrete construction, along with reinforced brick masonry. Early career Born in LaSalle, Illinois, Martin received his Bachelor of Science degree in architectural engineering from the University of Illinois in 1902 and began his career as a draftsman at Brown-Ketcham Iron Works in Indianapolis, Indiana. He worked in his early career in steel and iron for the Pennsylvania Railroad and Cambria Steel Company. In 1904, Martin moved to Los Angeles, where he worked as a construction superintendent for Carl Leonardt & Company.

Early tenants included Clarence Darrow, General Petroleum Corporation and the chancery office of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles. * Desmond's (department store), 1924. Beaux-Arts/Spanish Colonial Revival mix * Los Angeles City Hall - Martin was also one of three prominent local architects, along with John Parkinson and John C. Austin, hired to design what has become the most recognized building in Los Angeles. The selection of an architect for the city hall led to fierce competition among the city's leading architects. The City Council selected the firm of Curlett and Beelman, but the Board of Public Works opted instead to hire a trio of the city's top architects in Martin, Parkinson, and Austin. Controversy continued when the architects turned in drawings for 28-story tower to house a municipal government that could adequately fit into the first four floors. In April 1926, Martin spoke in support of the design. Martin said: \\"The tower, one of the most efficient parts of the structure, will care for future growth. This tower, in fact, has a three-fold advantage - it gives the building a distinctly beautiful profile, eliminates the possibility of Los Angeles having to spend money in a few years to house the city's business, and admits of a maximum of outside office space.\\" The city ultimately accepted the tower plan, and in March 1928 the Board of Public Works passed a resolution commending the architects \\"for the eminently satisfactory and beautiful design of the monumental building.\\" It was the city's tallest building for three decades. * May Company Wilshire department store (1939) was one of Martin's final landmark structures. The building is located in the Miracle Mile district on Wilshire Boulevard. * Million Dollar Theater (Sid Grauman's Million Dollar Theatre) (1917) - While the auditorium was designed by William L. Woollett, Martin designed the 12-story tower that houses the theater. The building long housed the original headquarters of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, at 307 South Broadway. * Queen of Angels Hospital * St. Alphonsus Catholic Church - Martin designed this historic church in Fresno, California in 1913. * St. Monica Catholic Church - Built in Santa Monica from 1925 to 1926, this church was featured in the 1944 film classic Going My Way with Bing Crosby. It is also the home parish of California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. The parish hall, built in 1998, was designed by Frank Gehry. * St. Vincent's Catholic Church - Located in the West Adams district, St. Vincent's and its dome are one of the most recognized churches in Los Angeles. * Ventura County Courthouse - Martin's Roman Doric courthouse, built from 1911 to 1912 in Ventura, California, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1971, becoming the second building in Ventura County to be added to the National Register. Recognition and later life In all, Martin and his associates designed some 1,500 buildings. In 1959, the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce recognized Martin for his contributions to the development of Los Angeles, by awarding him its annual \\"Man of Achievement\\" award. Martin's achievements included development of a system of reinforced concrete construction in 1907 and development of a method of reinforced brick masonry in 1933 to help safeguard the city's buildings against earthquakes.

She was designed to travel the Inside Passage along the British Columbia coast to Alaska. Her construction marked a turning point in Geary's career: previously he had built workboats; from this time he built yachts. In her early years, expeditions on the Westward were hunting expeditions, with \\"a Norwegian whale gun shooting harpoons fitted with time fuse bombs, a 10-horse gasoline winch with thirty-six hundred feet [1097 meters] of quarter-inch [0.6 cm] plow steel cable as a fishing line, and all of the accessories for 'scrapping it out' with fifty-ton [about 45 metric tonnes] whales\\".

Fort Tompkins (and its predecessor of the same name) guarded the landward approaches to other forts in the area from 1808 through circa 1898. The current fort was built 1847-1861, and was operational as a fort until superseded by new defenses circa 1898. It is now part of the Gateway National Recreation Area. It is the last remaining of four forts in New York State named Fort Tompkins. Note: This includes History Colonial and Revolution The first use of the land for military purposes was as the site of a blockhouse built by Dutch settler David Pieterszen de Vries in 1636 on Signal Hill (now the site of Fort Tompkins), which was burned in an Indian raid of the Peach Tree War in 1655.Roberts, pp. 587-589Fort Wadsworth at American Forts Network The site is said to have been continuously garrisoned since another blockhouse was built in 1663, which survived at least through 1808.Roberts, pp. 587-589 During the American Revolution the area became known as the Patriot redoubt Flagstaff Fort; captured by the British in 1776, it remained in British hands and was expanded until the war's end in 1783. Early 19th century The area became the responsibility of New York State in 1806, at which time four forts were built on the site with state resources, being ready for service in 1808 though incomplete. These included the red sandstone Forts Richmond (on the site now called Battery Weed) and Tompkins, on the sites of the current forts but of different design, along with Forts Morton and Hudson, with positions for a total of 164 guns in the four forts.Fort Wadsworth at FortWiki.com Fort Tompkins at that time included a red sandstone enclosure containing the 1663 blockhouse. Fort Richmond was initially semicircular while Fort Tompkins was a regular pentagon with circular bastions, both very different from their Third System replacements. Although these forts were contemporary with the federal government's second system of seacoast fortifications, they were not part of the federal program. Federal rebuilding of Forts Richmond and Tompkins did not begin until 1847. Fort Richmond was named for Richmond County, in which Staten Island is located, while Fort Tompkins was named for Daniel D. Tompkins, governor of New York State in the War of 1812. New York City was not attacked in that war, so the first Fort Tompkins did not see action, although it was improved and the area fortified with up to 900 cannon during that war. Third system By 1835 Forts Richmond and Tompkins had deteriorated to the point that they were declared unfit for use, and the next year the federal government began a decade-long process of purchasing them. In 1847 total reconstructions of both forts began, under the federal third system of seacoast fortifications, an across-the-board program of new forts sparked by the burning of Washington, DC in the War of 1812. Some sources state that the new Forts Richmond and Tompkins were initially designed by Robert E. Lee during his tenure as post engineer at Fort Hamilton in the 1840s.Fort Tompkins at New York State Military Museum Fort Richmond guarded the Narrows against enemy ships with 116 cannon, while Fort Tompkins provided the bulk of the landward defense in the area, with one seaward and four landward fronts. The fort was in the shape of a wide rectangle with a shallow \\"V\\" on the landward side. It was unusual in having no embrasures for cannon in the main fort. A seacoast cannon battery was mounted on the roof of the seacoast front, and the rest of the fort had only musket loopholes. It had a ditch on the landward sides with tunnels to counterscarp galleries providing additional musket fire against enemies in the ditch, supplemented by a few well-placed flank howitzers.Weaver, pp. 155-159 Both forts were ready for service, though still incomplete, when the Civil War broke out in April, 1861. 1861-1905 The Fort Tompkins area was important as a mobilization center in the Civil War, and it was further fortified. New York City was not attacked in that war, so the fort did not see action. In the 1890s new gun batteries were built under the Endicott Program, and Fort Tompkins' role in the area's defense ceased. In 1902 the area was designated as Fort Wadsworth, with Fort Richmond (renamed Fort Wadsworth in 1865) becoming Battery Weed. Present Fort Tompkins was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. In 1979 the Navy acquired the site as part of Naval Station New York, but in 1995 the Navy base was disestablished and the Fort Wadsworth property became part of the Gateway National Recreation Area under the National Park Service.

It later became part of the \\"rustic\\" wing of the art pottery movement. History Thomas Brannam took over the lease of an existing pottery at North Walk, and another in Litchdon Street, Barnstaple. Like other pottery firms of the time, the firm originally made utilitarian wares such as basic household items, floor tiles, bricks and sewage pipes. This was their \\"bread and butter\\" trade, although one of their decorative jugs secured a medal at the Great Exhibition in 1851. In 1867 Thomas's son, Charles Hubert Brannam, left school at age 12 to start work at the pottery. Charles won a prize for art at school and also won the Queen's Prize for Drawing in 1870. Initially educated in the theory and practice of ceramics, he was encouraged by a local dignitary, William Frederick Rock, who invited him to London where he studied pottery in the various museums. In 1879 he persuaded his father to allow him to produce art ware. His father agreed on the proviso that Charles paid for the materials he used. Charles eventually took over the Litchdon Street pottery and further developed the art pottery department, utilising the \\"sgraffito\\" technique of scratching into a covering of \\"slip\\" to show the clay beneath. He recruited skilled designers, but also continued to throw the ware himself. In 1885 he received an order from Queen Victoria which resulted in excellent publicity for the business. In 1886 Charles registered the name Royal Barum Ware and ensured it was sold by several London firms including Liberty. Charles handed the business over to his sons, Charles William Brannam, and John Woolacott (Jack) Brannam, in 1913. In 1914 C.H. Brannam and Sons became a limited liability company. Jack's son, Peter, carried out considerable modernization in the post-war period, but when he retired in 1979 he sold the business to Candy Tiles of Newton Abbot. They found the old Litchdon Street premises too cramped for their operation, and in 1989 moved the company to a site on the Roundswell Industrial Estate. Despite the fact that no member of the family was still connected with it, it was still called \\"C.H.Brannam & Sons Ltd\\". It ceased operations in 2005.

Biography Schmid was born at Landau. As a boy he studied music with his father who was a school teacher and choral conductor. He also sang in the boys choir at Regensburg Cathedral for several years. He entered the Munich Akademie der Tonkunst where he studied composition with Ludwig Thuille. In 1905 he was appointed to teach at the Munich Academy and in 1919 was promoted to a full professor. After World War I, Schmid entered a highly successful part of his career both as a performer and composer. He toured throughout Austria, Scandinavia, and Russia. In 1921 he became director of the Karlsruhe Conservatory and assumed the directorship of the Augsburg Music School [now Conservatory] in 1924. He retired from academic work in 1932. He died at Geiselbullach, near Munich, in 1953. Work Stylistically, Schmid's compositions were more in keeping with the late-Romantics than with 20th-century innovations. Brahms in particular had a major influence on Schmid's compositional sensibility. This is particularly evident in the sonatas for violin and piano (1920, 1939). His best work is probably his Symphony in D Minor (1947) which was admired for its fresh and accomplished treatment of traditional musical materials. Elements of Bavarian folk music appear in the rural mass settings, choral compositions, lieder, chamber works, and his opera Finden und Meiden. Sources *Andrew D. McCredie.

Red indicates the inferred boundaries of the Coast Range Arc. The Coast Range Arc was a large volcanic arc system, extending from northern Washington through British Columbia and the Alaska Panhandle to southwestern Yukon. The Coast Range Arc lies along the western margin of the North American Plate in the Pacific Northwest of western North America. Although taking its name from the Coast Mountains, this term is a geologic grouping rather than a geographic one, and the Coast Range Arc extended south into the High Cascades of the Cascade Range, past the Fraser River which is the northward limit of the Cascade Range proper. The Coast Range Arc formed as a result of subduction of the Kula and pre-existing Farallon Plates. It is most famous for being the largest granitic outcropping in North America, which then it is usually referred to as the Coast Plutonic Complex or the Coast Mountains Batholith. It is a coast-parallel continental volcanic arc similar to the Andes of South America and the largest continental volcanic arc fossil in the world. Geology Evolution Plate tectonics of the Coast Range Arc about 75 million years ago Volcanism in the arc began during the Late Cretaceous period 100 million years ago based on andesitic composition of the Early Cretaceous volcanic sections and their close temporal and spatial association with masses of felsic intrusive igneous rock with phaneritic texture called tonalite. The basement of the Coast Range Arc was likely Early Cretaceous and Late Jurassic intrusions. Stratigraphic and field relations in the arc suggest that the Coast Range Arc was created on Stikinia, a geologic feature that formed in an older volcanic arc environment during the Paleozoic and Mesozoic periods. Plate distribution between 64 and 74 million years ago. Arrows represent direction of subduction along North America. One of the major events during the Coast Range Arc was about 85 million years ago when a huge rift developed near the center of the oceanic Farallon Plate. This rifting event created the oceanic Kula Plate. It is unknown why such a large rupture of the Farallon Plate occurred. Some geologists believe some fundamental change in convection within the Earth's mantle caused the rifting event, while others believe the huge oceanic plate became mechanically unstable as it continued to subduct beneath the Pacific Northwest. The Kula Plate once again continued to subduct beneath the continental margin, supporting the Coast Range Arc. Volcanism began to decline along the length of the arc about 60 million years ago during the early Paleogene period of the Cenozoic era as the rapid northern movement of the Kula Plate became parallel with the Pacific Northwest, creating a transform fault plate boundary similar to the Queen Charlotte Fault. During this passive plate boundary, the Kula Plate began subducting underneath Alaska and southwestern Yukon at the northern end of the arc during the early Eocene period. The Coast Range Arc was home to some of the world's most dangerous and explosive volcanoes. Cataclysmic eruptions at the British Columbia‚ÄìYukon border created a huge nested caldera called the Bennett Lake Volcanic Complex about 50 million years ago during the early Eocene period. These eruptions were from vents along arcuate fracture systems associated with the caldera, which discharged about of pyroclastic material. This volcanic event occurred shortly before nearly all the Kula Plate had been subducted beneath the North American Plate about 40 million years ago. View of the Juneau Icefield and granite outcrops in the Boundary Ranges of the Coast Mountains Since the end of the Coast Range Arc about 50 million years ago, many volcanoes have disappeared from erosion. What remains of the Coast Range Arc to this day are granitic intrusions, which were formed when magma intruded and cooled at depth beneath the volcanoes. However, remnants of some volcanoes exist in southwestern Yukon, including Montana Mountain, Mount Nansen, and the Bennett Lake, Mount Skukum and Sifton Range volcanic complexes. Many granitic rocks of the Coast Range Arc are plentiful in the North Cascades of the Cascade Range, which is the southernmost boundary of the arc. Here, these granites intruded highly deformed ocean rocks and assorted fragments from pre-existing island arcs, largely remnants of the ancient Bridge River Ocean which lay between North America and the pre- existing Insular Islands. Massive amounts of molten granite injected over this period, burning the old oceanic sediments into a glittering medium-grade metamorphic rock called schist. The older intrusions of the Coast Range Arc were then deformed under the heat and pressure of later intrusions, turning them into a layered metamorphic rock known as gneiss. In some places, mixtures of older intrusive rocks and the original oceanic rocks have been distorted and warped under intense heat, weight and stress to create unusual swirled patterns known as migmatite, appearing to have been nearly melted in the procedure. The remarkable migmatite of the Chelan and Skagit areas in Washington are well known in geologic circles. During construction of intrusions 70 and 57 million years ago, the northern motion of the Kula Plate might have been between per year. However, other geologic studies determined the Kula Plate moved at a rate as fast as per year. Geological importance Plate distribution 55 million years ago. Arrows represent direction of subduction along North America. Intrusions of the Coast Range Arc are intruded by widespread basaltic dikes. These dikes, although not voluminous, provide an important sampling of the post-arc lithosphere. Additionally, widespread volcanic belts, such as the Anahim Volcanic Belt, lie in the middle of the Coast Range Arc. Volcanics that form the Anahim Volcanic Belt are not strictly related to Coast Range Arc subduction, but might have formed as a result of the North American Plate sliding over a place that has experienced active volcanism for a long period of time which is described as the Anahim hotspot. During its formation, it lay beneath granitic intrusions of the Coast Range Arc. The approximately long Bella Bella and approximately long Gale Passage dike swarms lie in granitic intrusions of the Coast Range Arc and are used to calculate the first appearance of the Anahim hotspot about 13 and 12 million years ago.

As a result, trees of Sayama Tea evolved to have thick leaves that can withstand cold weather. Tea extracted from such thick leaves resulted in a distinct sweet and rich flavor. Sayama tea has been found to have some of the highest levels of the beneficial antioxidants found in green tea.http://lib3.dss.go.th/fulltext/Journal/J.Sci.Food%20and%20Agri/2005v85/no.12/2005v85no12p2125-2133.pdf Region The Musashino Plateau on which Sayama Tea is grown is suitable for tea growing. The plateau consists of two layers. The lower layer consists of conglomerates and sandstones that were brought to this region by rivers. The upper layer is made of a reddish loam created by the accumulation of volcanic ash. Together, these two layers make the region unsuitable for growing rice but suitable for tea growing, which requires high precipitation and high soil permeability. History It is known that the Japanese people started growing tea trees roughly 800 years ago when Buddhist monks who traveled to China brought back seeds. A historical document from the Nanboku-ch≈ç period, , mentions as one of the best regions for tea along with , , , , and . However, the production of tea was interrupted by war during the Sengoku period.http://www.alit.city.iruma.saitama.jp/07tea-museum/13history.html Iruma Municipal Museum, Tea Museum website Widespread tea growing restarted in the Mid-Edo period. In 1802, a technique called , first steaming and then roasting on the surface of washi was invented by , , and , based on the Uji roasting technique, which was deemed the best method in Japan at that time. Iruma Municipal Museum, Tea Museum website and This led to the revival of tea production in the region. In 1819 (Bunsei 2), tea leaves produced in this method started to be shipped to Edo in large amounts, receiving good reputations. After the Meiji Restoration, tea became one of the important exporting goods. Sayama Tea was exported to North America. In 1875 (Meiji 8), a privately owned company ‚ÄúSayama Corporation‚Äù started direct exports of tea to the US. Around this time, the name of Sayama Tea began to be fixed. Although the war cause the production of tea to dwindle, the production soon recovered and by the 1960s and 1970s reached its peak. At present, however, the production and the area of tea fell to nearly half of those in the 1970s.

Ocean Beach is a long sandy beach which runs along the Pacific Ocean coast of south Dunedin, New Zealand. It stretches for some three kilometres from Saint Clair in the southwest along the coast of Saint Kilda to the foot of Lawyer's Head in the east. The beach is a popular recreation area for Dunedinites for swimming, surfing, and walking. Geography Saint Clair Beach. The salt-water pool is visible at top right. Looking past the posts at the end of Saint Clair Beach towards Saint Kilda. The dunes behind Middle Beach are clearly shown. Stormy seas in the early years of the 21st century have reduced the remaining number of posts to fewer than ten. The beach is divided into three roughly equal lengths, known as Saint Clair Beach, Middle Beach, and Saint Kilda Beach. Access is easiest at the Saint Clair end, with steps and ramps down to the beach from Saint Clair Esplanade. The esplanade is the site of several cafes and restaurants. At its end, also the western end of the beach, is the Saint Clair salt-water swimming pool, the city‚Äôs oldest pool, opened in 1884.Newton, p.106 The pool has been upgraded on several occasions, most recently in 2002.Newton, p.113 A short walking track leads southwest from the pool to Second Beach, a small stony beach sitting at the bottom of the basalt cliffs of Forbury Head. Saint Clair Beach is a popular surfing venue, as well as having a patrolled swimming area. Shark nets have been deployed one kilometre out from the beach every summer since 1970,Newton, p.104 making this a safe swimming area. Major surf lifesaving and surfing championships are regularly hosted at Saint Clair Beach. The western end of Saint Clair Beach is marked by a series of old wooden posts, the remains of an old breakwater groyne. These posts are often erroneously thought by Dunedinites an visitors to be the remains of a jetty. During the Victorian and Edwardian eras, there were several groynes along the beach which protected it from erosion. The groynes have fallen into disrepair since that time, with only a handful of posts from the last groyne remaining in place. The other major access-point to the beach is at Saint Kilda, where a sandy slope leads down to the sea from the road. Here, too, is a patrolled swimming area. Between the two access points is Middle Beach. This is backed by a series of high dunes topped by a walkway linking Saint Clair Esplanade with the Sir James Barnes Lookout, which offers views across south Dunedin from above Forbury Park Raceway. Behind these dunes are several of the city‚Äôs sports grounds, notably Kettle Park. The Ocean Beach Railway runs through these parks from the Otago Model Engineering Club‚Äôs premises close to the Saint Kilda beach access point. In recent years the dunes have been subject to severe erosion, and measures have been taken by the Dunedin City Council to reinforce them. This is not the first time that erosion has threatened properties along this stretch of Dunedin‚Äôs coast. Heavy seas during the 1890s and early 1900s caused loss of land close to Saint Clair, and the current esplanade is sited along the line of the first sea wall to be built along this stretch of coast, built between 1911 and 1913.Newton, p.103 Wildlife Despite being a well-frequented beach within an urban area, Ocean Beach is regularly visited by a wide array of wildlife. Both seals and sea lions are occasional visitors, as are blue penguins. See also *White Island, Otago *Tunnel Beach References Further reading *Newton, B.A. (2003) Our St. Clair.

Two of his books have been nominated for National Book Awards. Born in Massillon, Ohio and raised in Whiting, Indiana from the age of seven, Wagoner attended Pennsylvania State University where he was a member of Naval ROTC and graduated in three years. He received an M.A. in English from the Indiana University in 1949 and has taught at the University of Washington since 1954 on the suggestion of friend and fellow poet Theodore Roethke.

One of his novels, The Escape Artist, was turned into a film by executive producer Francis Ford Coppola. He currently teaches in the low-residency MFA program of the Northwest Institute of Literary Arts on Whidbey Island. Pacific Northwest The natural environment of the Pacific Northwest is the subject of much of David Wagoner's poetry. He cites his move from the Midwest as a defining moment: \\"[W]hen I came over the Cascades and down into the coastal rainforest for the first time in the fall of 1954, it was a big event for me, it was a real crossing of a threshold, a real change of consciousness. Nothing was ever the same again.\\" Awards David Wagoner's Collected Poems was nominated for the National Book Award in 1977 and he won the Pushcart Prize that same year. He was again nominated for a National Book Award in 1979 for In Broken Country. He won his second Pushcart Prize in 1983. He is the recipient of the American Academy of Arts and Letters award, the Sherwood Anderson Foundation Fiction Award, the Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize (1991), the English-Speaking Union prize from Poetry magazine, and the Arthur Rense Prize in 2011.

The unit takes its lineage from units raised as part of the colonial forces of the state of Queensland in 1860 and served during the Second Boer War and World War I. In 1930 it was amalgamated with the 2nd Light Horse Regiment to become the 2nd/14th Light Horse Regiment (Queensland Mounted Infantry), a unit that continues to exist as part of the Australian Army today. Lineage The 14th Light Horse Regiment has a convoluted lineage,This unit was separate to the 2nd Battalion, Queensland Mounted Infantry which became the 14th Australian Light Horse Regiment in 1903 before subsequently being redesignated as the 3rd Light Horse Regiment in 1913 and then the 11th (Darling Downs) Light Horse (QMI) in 1918. See CMF Light Horse. having its origins in the 4th Battalion, Queensland Mounted Infantry (QMI), which was a unit of the colonial forces of the state of Queensland that was first raised in 1860. When the Second Boer War broke out, the QMI were sent to South Africa to fight alongside contingents from a number of Australian colonies and it was there that the unit won its first battle honour.The regiment was officially presented with this battle honour in 1908. After the Boer War the Australian colonial forces were amalgamated into the military forces of the newly federated nation of Australia. As a part of this amalgamation the four battalions of the QMI were reformed as light horse regiments, and the 4th Battalion became the 27th Light Horse Regiment. 14th Light Horse Regiment on parade at Homs, Syria on Christmas Day 1918 In 1912, a system of compulsory military service was instituted in Australia, the result of which was the expansion of the Army. Consequently, most the units of the QMI were redesignated, and the 27th Light Horse Regiment became the 27th Light Horse (North Queensland Light Horse) Regiment. With the outbreak of World War I, due to the provisions of the Defence Act 1903 which did not allow for conscripts to be sent overseas to fight, it was decided to raise an all volunteer force for service overseas; this was designated the Australian Imperial Force (AIF).Grey 2008, p. 85. While the units of the AIF were deployed overseas to Gallipoli and the Western Front, the original units of the QMI remained in Australia on home service. Formation and operational history The 14th Light Horse Regiment was raised in March 1916 as part of the AIF at Enoggera, Queensland, attached to the 3rd Division. It departed from Sydney on the steamship Beltana on 13 May 1916, bound for England where it was intended to be brought up to full strength to serve as the 3rd Division's light horse regiment. Before it could be brought up to full strength, however, the establishment was reduced to only one squadron per division and as such only 'A' Squadron was formed. Soon afterwards, however, the divisional establishments of the Australian Army were changed again, this time removing mounted troops from the order of battle altogether. As a result, it was decided to disband the regiment. In June 1918, the 14th Light Horse Regiment was reformed from the Imperial Camel Corps in Palestine, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel George Langley. This unit had been disbanded due to the unsuitability of the camels to the fighting in Palestine, however, it had performed very well in the previous campaigns in Egypt and the Sinai and had earned a number of battle honours, which the 14th subsequently inherited. Together with the 15th Light Horse Regiment and a French colonial regiment they formed the 5th Light Horse Brigade, attached to the Australian Mounted Division. The 5th Light Horse Brigade were involved in the fighting against the Turks around Megiddo in September 1918, during which time they suffered eight men killed. Over the course of ten days the brigade advanced more than before entering Damascus on 1 October 1918, after which they spent the next month performing garrison duties as the brigade prepared to take part in the advance towards Aleppo. Turkey surrendered on 30 October 1918, thus preventing the regiment from seeing any further action during the war. However, before they were to return to Australia they were used to quell the Egyptian Revolution of 1919. They finally embarked for the return voyage to Australia on 24 July 1919. Perpetuation After the war, in Australia the units of the QMI underwent another reorganisation when they were renumbered once again. In 1922, the 27th Light Horse (North Queensland Light Horse) Regiment became the 14th (North Queensland) Light Horse Regiment. The AIF was officially disbanded in April 1921 and in the subsequent re-organisation of the Australian Army it was decided that the associated Citizens Military Force units would retain the AIF battle honours.Grey 2008, p. 125. Thus, when the 27th became the 14th in 1922 it was officially given the battle honours of its AIF counterpart. In 1927, the regiment's name was changed again to the 14th (West Moreton) Light Horse Regiment. In 1930, due to economic constraints caused by the Great Depression the 14th was amalgamated with the 2nd (Moreton) Light Horse Regiment to become the 2nd/14th Light Horse Regiment (Queensland Mounted Infantry).Starr and Sweeney 1989, p. 1965. In September 1939, following the outbreak of World War II, the 2nd/14th was assigned to the 1st Australian Cavalry Brigade. In 1940, the 2nd/14th was delinked and the 14th Light Horse Regiment was re-raised as a machine-gun unit. It was assigned to the 4th Australian Cavalry Brigade. Two years later it was renamed as the 14th Motor Regiment, however, it was disbanded shortly afterwards in May 1942 when its personnel were transferred to the 2/4th Armoured Regiment.

It is a registered charity in England & Wales and in 2018 disbursed $232 million. With assets of GBP ¬£5.2 billion (USD $6.6 billion), it is the 5th largest global development philanthropy in the world. It is also the world's largest philanthropy that focuses specifically on improving children's lives. CIFF was established in 2002 by Sir Chris Hohn and wife, Jamie Cooper-Hohn as the philanthropic arm of Hohn's hedge fund, the Children's Investment Fund Management (TCI Fund Management), which in 2019, topped the list of the most profitable hedge funds in the world. By utilising a hybrid fund-and-foundation model, Hohn sought to bring a private sector-like approach to philanthropy with intellectual rigour and commercial acumen to attain clear returns for children from the outset. The foundation's approach emphasises a high appetite for risk to invest in bold ideas for transformative and scalable solutions and reliance on high-quality data and evidence. It has pioneered the use of several innovative financing tools and catalytic funding mechanisms within development contexts and has become one of the leaders in venture philanthropy for global development. Jamie Cooper-Hohn managed CIFF until 2013 when Michael Anderson was appointed Chief Executive Officer. The CEO is now Kate Hampton, a key figure behind the creation of the 2016 Paris Agreement . History In an example of \\"venture philanthropy\\" or \\"philanthrocapitalism\\", CIFF was set up to automatically receive a portion of profits from TCI fund management. The original formula involved transfers of 0.5 percent of the fund's assets each year, with a further 0.5 per cent of assets for every year during which the fund achieved returns of more than 11 per cent. It is reported that Hohn established the formulaic charitable link in order to motivate himself.TCI goes where other funds fear to tread - FT.com Coinciding with the couple's divorce proceedings, changes set in motion in 2012 led to the splitting up of the fund and the foundation. The fund no longer donates money to the foundation on a contractual basis, though it may do so on a discretionary basis. Activities CIFF focuses on transforming the lives of poor and vulnerable children living in developing countries. CIFF's investment priorities are childhood and adolescence, child protection, and climate change. Within childhood and adolescence, areas of work include empowering girls and boys to control their sexual and reproductive health and to avoid unwanted pregnancies and HIV/AIDS; improving children and mothers‚Äô health and nutrition; preventing low birthweight babies; eliminating deaths from severe acute malnutrition, nested within a more integrated approach to childhood development; and deworming efforts to break transmission for good. In 2019, CIFF in partnership with Wellcome Trust also launched a joint Lancet- Financial Times Commission on Artificial Intelligence in global health expected to be published by end of 2021. CIFF‚Äôs child protection work focuses on ending child labour and sexual exploitation by enabling an environment that reduces vulnerability of communities and increases protection of children. The organisation‚Äôs climate portfolio is driven by a vision of a climate-safe future for today‚Äôs children and future generations that also bear the benefits of cleaner air, energy security and sustainable jobs. Highlights from CIFF's portfolio in 2018 include: * CIFF and its co-founder Sir Christopher Hohn agreed to donate US$500 million to climate action over the next five years at the Global Climate Action Summit. * CIFF partners BRAC and Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN) created the largest commercial model for micronutrient powder in the world. Over 145 million sachets of the powder have been sold over the past five years, and an evaluation undertaken in 2018 shows a significant reduction in anaemia among children under five years of age. * HIV self-testing increased from 500,000 in 2017 to over 5 million in 2018, spurred on by a partnership between CIFF, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and OraSure, which lowered the price of HIV self-tests to US$2. * CIFF partner, Bachpan Bachao Andolan's work to facilitate access to justice for children in India led to the launch of prosecution in 9,177 cases of juvenile justice, child labour and commercial sexual exploitation of children. * CIFF expanded its commitment to deworming, which has so far delivered 1.8 billion treatments for parasitic worm infections in India, Ethiopia and Kenya including the world's largest ever public health intervention in a single day during which the Government of India delivered treatment to 270 million children in 2016. * CIFF saw the conclusion of the Implants Access Programme, in which a volume guarantee from CIFF and Gates Foundation halved the price of contraceptive implants from Bayer and Merck - increasing uptake of implants by projected 10 fold from start of the program in 2012 and saving procurers over US$500 million. * CIFF catalysed a new $275 million coalition (including $175 in aligned capital investments) among 8 philanthropies and 4 governments (Canada, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom) to accelerate energy transition in South East Asia. The partnership helps to promote the right market conditions for the region‚Äôs private sector to ramp up investments in climate initiatives. Some of the grants CIFF made in 2014 include: * $50 million funding to prioritise national deworming programmes through the Uniting to Combat Neglected Tropical Diseases partnership. * $50 million to increase the number of children receiving life-saving antiretroviral therapy in partnership with the US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). * $20 million pledged in response to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. * Launched (along with UBS Optimus Foundation, Educate Girls and Instiglio) the first ever development impact bond. In 2013, CIFF committed to spend $787 million over 7 years to tackle malnutrition. This was part of a total pledge of $4.1 billion towards reducing malnutrition announced at the Nutrition for Growth summit in London, co-hosted by the United Kingdom, Brazil and CIFF. In 2012, CIFF was one of the signatories of the London Declaration on Neglected Tropical Diseases, a WHO inspired collaborative disease eradication programme of 10 neglected tropical diseases. The Clinton Foundation lists CIFF among 7 organisations from which it received more than US$25 million. According to the OECD, CIFF provided USD 231 million for development in 2018, of which 98.8% was provided in the form of grants and 1.2% in the form of non-grants.https://www.oecd- ilibrary.org//sites/fbd03a24-en/index.html?itemId=/content/component/5d8de3e1-en&_csp_=fcd6b6f78f50e596d3bf597cb6b3e3b5&itemIGO;=oecd&itemContentType;=chapter# References External links * Children's charities based in the United Kingdom Development charities based in the United Kingdom Medical and health foundations Organizations established in 2002 2002 establishments in the United Kingdom ","title":"The Children's Investment Fund Foundation"},{"id":"19198047","text":"The 1988 Eagle Classic was a men's WCT and Nabisco Grand Prix tennis tournament held in Scottsdale, Arizona in the United States.

It is located at an altitude of 115 metres (380 feet). History Yazman is primarily called a gateway to the Cholistan Desert. It is the largest Tehsil of Bahawalpur District. Yazman is a unique offspring of the process of colonization of the defunct state of Bahawalpur and it was named after a city of ‚ÄúYazman‚Äù in a Syrian region of Balkh. Yazman is actually a seven to eight decades older city. The following three factors played a vital role in its colonization and development. 1-It is situated at a starting point of Cholistan, 32 kilometers from Bahawalpur (The capital of the ex-state of Bahawalpur and a commissionerate and divisional headquarters after its merger into Pakistan) 2-The colonization as a result of the completion of Satluj Valley Project canal system. 3-An important station of the Cholistan or Colony Railway Line laid down from Samma Satta, Bahawalpur to Fort Abbas via Yazman. Yazman came into being because an administrative unit was required in the colony area of Cholistan. After 1955 the coming years heralded a new era of development and progress and its infrastructure was enhanced to the maximum extent. With effect from 1 July 1984 Yazman gained the status of Tahsil with a high profile socio-economic and agrarian progress. Tehsil level offices of all important departments i.e. Police, Agriculture, Social Welfare, Education, Food, Forest, sports, irrigation, electricity, telephone and branches of all the national banks are operational here. Special focus on the development of Cholistan has been a special phenomenon. After devolution many development projects of education, irrigation, communication, public health engineering and electricity have so far been carried out. The famous village of this area is Chak_No_114/DNB Chak_No_39/DB Near Kudwala Chak_No_106/DB, Yazman Mandi Transportation  Keeping in view to provide an effective infrastructural facility in the form of state controlled communication, a 124 miles project of a railway line from Samma Satta to Bahawal Nagar via Fort Abbas was started in November 1926. In the first phase railway line was laid down from Bahawal Nagar to Doga Bonga and was inaugurated in 1928. It was extended to Fort Abbas during the next two years. The project of remaining 80 miles from Fort Abbas to Samma Satta with the prominent stations of Mansoora, Quresh, Yazman and Qattal Ammara was completed during the period of next four to five years. This railway line could be utilized only for five years as on the request of the British Indian Government (a patron of the Bahawalpur state) all the infrastructure of railway line was given to the old patron to meet the urgent requirements of the Second World War at Indian Fronts. The Nawab of Bahawalpur sanctioned the removal of 80 of the 124 miles railway track on 12 December 1940. It was lifted with a hope and plan to be re-laid after war. But that hope was never fulfilled and as a consequence the then required level of development in the colony area of Fort Abbas, Fort Marot and Yazman suffered a great setback in the days to come. In 1943 Yazman was conferred upon the status of Notified Area Committee (NAC or Sub Tahsil) along with its neighboring cities of Hasilpur, for Abbas and others like Bahawal Nagar, Sadiq Abad, Chishtian and Haroon Abad with a subsequent extension up to 31 March 1947 and a Naib tahsildar was posted who was also ex-officio chairman of the Committee. In order to facilitate the agro based economy, the State had a norm to alleviate some of the cities to the level of Mandi. Yazman was given the status of non-permanent Mandi in 1943-44 and was upgraded to the level of Permanent Mandi in 1949. The construction work of the Yazman City was started through auction of plots for commercial and residential purpose by the state administration. A brick kiln was approved for the promotion of construction work. One dispensary was established in 1942‚Äì43. The figures of the income and expenditure of Yazman committee as Rs.1621, Rs.2531 and Rs.1016, Rs.1364 are available in the administrative reports for the years 1942-43 and 1943‚Äì44. In the same year there was a police station with a staff of one Sub inspector, one hawaldar and 18 constables. The state administration report for the year 1946-47 reflects that ‚Äúthe construction of water courses in Yazman is given due importance. Yazman is indicating a permanent low profile of development due to poor situation of the communication.‚Äù The provision of communication facilities was a major motive in this area. Apart from the railway line (discarded after only five years), lorry service was started between Bahawalpur to Fort Abbas and Yazman on the non metaled road which continued up to the merger of the state in Pakistan till 1955. When the 32 kilometers road between Bahawalpur and Yazman was converted into metalled road, the transport service and its quality became better and comfortable.  Sites   Cholistan Desert  The desert area which comprises one third of the total area of the Bahawalpur District is called ‚ÄúCholistan‚Äù or ‚ÄúRohi‚Äù. In local dialect the word ‚ÄúCholistan‚Äù which means desert without water and grass. The Cholistan can be divided into two parts: VIZ Smaller Cholistan and Greater Cholistan. Smaller Cholistan is situated along with the irrigated area while Greater Cholistan lies further south. Some parts of Cholistan are open plain spaces, locally called ‚ÄúDahars‚Äù where soil is alluvial and suitable for cultivation. The other parts consists of sand dunes, called ‚ÄúTibas‚Äù rising at some places up to 100 meters with vegetation peculiar to sandy tracts. Cholistan was under regular irrigated cultivation till 1200 B.C and under seasonal regular irrigated cultivation till about 600 B.C. With the drying up of River Hakra the area was deserted with passage of time. There are more than 400 archeological sites which were once populated as per survey report of Dr. Rafique Mughal which was carried out in the winter of 1978 and published in an international magazine. Cholistan is also called as valley of Hakra. Average rainfall in Cholistan is 7.5 to 12.5 centimeters and subsoil water is brackish. Density population in Cholistan is only 09 persons per square kilometers. Animal population is around 1,200,000 which comprises camels, goats, sheep and cows. Cholistan is home of wildlife. Main source of drinking water both for human beings and animals, is rain water which is stored in ‚ÄúTobas‚Äù and ‚ÄúKunds‚Äù (water reservoir). Cholistanis constantly move in search of water. The desert on south was once habitable and forts of Derawar, Din Garh, Mauj Garh and Marot were situated at the bank of the dried up river called Sarswati, Hakra or Chughra. With the passage of time, its feeder channels changed route thus the vast tract of irrigated land converted into desert now called Cholistan. The population of Cholistan consists of Muslims and non-Muslims with culture and language of their own. Cholistani clans migrate to the plains of the district in summer with their animals when rain and water is scarce. The current major clans of Cholistan include Jaams, Jats, Arain, Rajputs and Balochis. Their sub-clans include Laars, Chatta, Cheema, Warraich, Rehan, Ghuman, Sidhu, Uppal, Janjua, Rathore, Bhatti, Leghari, Lashari, and Dashti. Though these clans are unique because of their historical past and maintenance of their tribal traditions. The crafts and folktales are very much recognized.  The Shrine of Channan Pir  A few kilometers from Yazman at the start of Cholistan, the Shrine of Channan Pir is situated. centre of the spiritual and cultural heritage of Yazman and Cholistan. Cultural activities are observed to be at the peak when Urs or Fair of Channan Pir is held on the consecutive seven Thursdays starting in the month of March every year. The visitors throw tabbaruk (the sacred sweet) and the persons who pick and taste this tabarruk are supposed to be fortunate in achieving their worldly pursuits. It is told that some time in the Seventh Century Hijri (the Islamic calendar) a well known spiritual celebrity of great stature at Uch Sharif Hazrat Makhdum Jalal-ud-Din Surkh Bukhari while traveling on route to Jasalmir a Hindu area, claimed that there was a Muslim residing in the area. He was replied in negative. He was told that the wife of the ruler (raja) of this area was expecting a baby. He predicted that he would be a staunch Muslim. The Raja became scared of the forecast of the saint and the newborn baby was laid alive in a cradle made of sandalwood and was thrown in the desert to vanish away. The supernatural phenomena protected and brought up the to be saint. He entered in the circle of Makhdum Jalal-ud-Din Surkh Bukhariand and was given the title Channan Pir. He converted many non-Muslims. The individuals of almost all the religions and sexes are devotees of Channan Pir and pay respects to him on the occasion of his death anniversary (Urs). The passionate devotees from all over the area pay homage to the saint as a token of acknowledgement of fulfillment of their desires for which they make vows. The Ruler Nawab of Bahawalpur paid a visit to the shrine along with the state Prime Minister Mr. Krafton and his spouse on March 14, 1943.  Derawar Fort  The most visited ancient site is Fort Derawar which is situated in the middle and on the interlinked old communication network of the Great Desert of Cholistan. Its distance from Ahmad Pur East is 50 km. The historians tell that Derawar Fort was constructed by the Raja of Bhatti tribes in 757 A.D. It is constructed in Hindu style of architecture. The first Nawab of Bahawalpur State Sadiq Muhammad Khan I while expanding the territory of the state attacked and got hold of the fort from Sardar Aghi Sing. Raja Jajja from a Bhatti tribe was the ruler of Khanpur and Ahmadpur. Another Raja Diwa Sing sought permission from his maternal uncle Sardar Jajja Sing to construct the fort at a bank of Hakra in Cholistan which was granted and its erection started in 837 A.D. Due to unknown reasons Raja Jajja ordered to suspend the process of construction. On the request of his sister, the mother of Diwa Sing, he again permitted to restart its construction. After its completion it was named as ‚ÄúDewar Awal‚Äù which became Derwar by the passage of time. In 1825, Nawab Sadiq Muhammad Khan III built a mosque in front of it on the true model of Jamia Masjid Dheli. Marble of very fine quality was used in the mosque of Derawar. It is a unique monument which was constructed with a material which was brought there from the remote areas to that area of poor communication. The family graveyard of the Nawabs Half km from the mosque is also worth seeing because of its style and architecture. CHAK NO 45/DNB Chak Number 108/DNB Chak number 108 DNB is present in Yazman as a village with population of about 1.34k. It is highly green area with about 70% cultivated area. It have only one government primary school and it is the only government service which is been applied to the people of this village.  Chak Number 52/DB  Chak number 52 DB is present in north eastern side of the Yazman. Chak Number 52/DB has three government schools but the literacy rate is pretty low.  Economy  The main ingredients of the social set up of Yazman are dominantly agrarian. The city gives a passive look on account of socio-economic conditions. Economic activity depends on a favorable climate. Its population consists mainly of lower middle class and low paid communities. The area is relatively backward and is not industrialized. The literacy rate is very poor. As the city of Yazman is very close to its district headquarters Bahawalpur, the residents of the city of Yazman prefer to avail the educational facilities at Bahawalpur.

During the inter war years, it was amalgamated with other battalions a couple of times before being re-raised in its own right in 1936. During World War II, the battalion remained in Australia and in 1942 was amalgamated with the 13th Battalion, which was disbanded the following year having not served overseas. History World War I Raised for service during World War I as part of the all-volunteer 1st Australian Imperial Force (AIF), the 33rd Battalion was formed in Australian in January 1916 as part of an expansion of the AIF that took place after the Gallipoli campaign. The majority of the battalion's personnel came from the New England region of New South Wales and as a result the 33rd Battalion came to be known unofficially as \\"New England's Own\\". and then the \\"Northern Battalion\\".The Farmer and Settler (Sydney, NSW 1906 - 1955) Fri 25 Feb 1916 Along with the 34th, 35th and 36th Battalions, all of which were raised from New South Wales, the 33rd formed the 9th Brigade of the Australian 3rd Division. Consisting of four companies, initially the battalion was formed along regional lines: 'A' Company was made from recruits drawn from Armidale and Tamworth; 'B' Company from Walcha, Uralla, Barraba, Bingara, New South Wales, and Manilla; 'C' Company from Narrabri, Moree, and Inverell; and 'D' Company from Glen Innes, Guyra, and Tenterfield. With an authorised strength of 1,023 men, the battalion's first commanding officer was Lieutenant Colonel Benjamin Frederick Parker,The Bathurst Times, 4 March 1916 who fell ill soon after being given command.The Maitland Weekly Mercury, 22 April 1916 Major Leslie Morshead was then given the command of the 33rd Battalion,The Maitland Weekly Mercury, 22 April 1916The Border Morning Mail and Riverina Times, 1 May 1916 and was the sole commanding officer while the battalion was on active-service. He later reached the rank of lieutenant general and commanded an Australian corps against the Japanese during World War II. After undertaking initial training at the showgrounds in Armidale, the battalion moved to Maitland, where they concentrated with the rest of the 9th Brigade. On 3 May 1916, the battalion entrained for Sydney, where they embarked upon the HMAT Marathon. Although originally it had been intended that they would go to Egypt, en route the battalion was redirected to the United Kingdom. George Cartwright, one of two men from the 33rd to receive the Victoria Cross. Sailing via Albany, in Western Australia, and making stops at Durban, Cape Town and Dakar, the battalion arrived in the United Kingdom on 9 July 1916. Moving to Larkhill, on Salisbury Plain, the 33rd underwent five months of intense training along with the rest of the 3rd Division to prepare them for the rigours of war on the Western Front, before moving to France in late November, crossing the English Channel on the ferry Mona Queen. After arriving in Le Havre, in France, the battalion moved by rail to Bailleul, from where they marched to the front, occupying a section of the line around Armenti√®res. Assigned to a \\"nursery\\" sector, for the next month they rotated between occupying the forward trenches and undertaking training courses, as the battalion was introduced to life on the European battlefield. Although the battalion gained some experience of combat over Christmas, when they launched raids against the German lines, their first major battle did not come until mid-1917, by which time the focus of British operations had shifted to the Ypres sector in Belgium. This first battle came at Messines where the 33rd, along with the rest of the 9th Brigade, led the 3rd Division's assault. After a number of mines were exploded in front of their positions, the assault began. The 33rd went in on the right, around Ploegsteert Wood, having been chosen especially for the position due to its danger. Despite suffering around 200 casualties from Allied gas-shells that had dropped short, the battalion went \\"over the top\\" at the appointed hour and, after skirting the large crater the mine had caused, secured their objective. After the battle, the battalion remained at the front, holding the ground they had gained, enduring almost constant shelling. The 33rd's casualties amounted to 92 killed in action or died of wounds, and 260 wounded; the heaviest they would suffer for the entire war. Messines was followed by actions during the Third Battle of Ypres in October. Moving up to Zonnebeke on the night of 2/3 October, in the first week of the push against Broodseinde, they were assigned a support role as the narrowness of the front limited the role of the 3rd Division. On 12 October, the Allied attack progressed into a second phase and the 3rd Division was thrown into the assault during the First Battle of Passchendaele. Heavily depleted, with a frontage of just 242 men, they fought around Augustus Wood, where the Germans had established many pillboxes before heavy rain washed away any hope of an Allied breakthrough. The following year, as the Germans launched a major offensive on the Western Front, they were thrust into the line in a desperate attempt to hold the line in front of the vital railhead of Amiens. There, the 33rd took part in heavy fighting when the Australians counter-attacked at Hangard Wood on 30 March, before finally turning back the German attack on Villers-Bretonneux on 4 April. At the end of the month, the battalion amalgamated with the 36th Battalion, as part of a general re-organisation of the AIF necessitated by heavy casualties and falling recruitment, which saw the disbandment of three battalions ‚Äì the 36th, 47th and 52nd ‚Äì in order to reinforce others. A peaceful penetration action was fought around Morlancourt by the 9th Brigade in early May 1918. In August, the Allies launched their own offensive ‚Äì the Hundred Days Offensive ‚Äì which ultimately brought about an end to the war. The 33rd was committed to the battle on 8 August, tasked with capturing Accroche Wood. A series of advances followed as the Allies broke through the German defences along the Hindenburg Line. After attacking around Road Wood in late August, they were withdrawn for three weeks training before taking part in a joint American-Australian attack at Bellecourt in late September. Following up the Americans, the 33rd held off a strong counter-attack by German forces around Gillemont Farm, before carrying out mopping-up operations towards Bony. After this, in early October, the battalion was pulled back to the Abbeville area, taking up billets in Citerne, where they remained until the armistice was signed in November. Following the end of hostilities, the battalion's numbers were slowly reduced as personnel were repatriated to Australia for demobilisation and finally, in May 1919, the battalion was disbanded. During the course of the war, the 33rd Battalion lost 451 killed men and 2,052 wounded. Two members of the battalion received the Victoria Cross: John Carroll and George Cartwright. The battalion received a total of 14 battle honours, which were bestowed upon it in 1927. Inter war years and subsequent service After the war, when Australia's military was re- organised to perpetuate the numerical designations of the AIF units in 1921, the battalion was reformed as a part-time unit of the Citizens Force, based in the New England region, assigned to the 1st Brigade. This was achieved by transferring personnel from two previously existing units: the 2nd Battalion, 33rd Infantry Regiment and the 2nd Battalion, 35th Infantry Regiment. In 1927, when territorial designations were introduced, the battalion adopted the title of the \\"New England Regiment\\" and the Latin motto Strenue Percute (translated strike vigorously), which had previously been used by the battalion during the war, was confirmed. From the outset, the Citizen Forces units were maintained through a mixture of voluntary and compulsory service; however, in 1929, the Universal Training Scheme was abolished by the Scullin Labor government and replaced with an all volunteer force known as the \\"Militia\\". This, coupled with the austerity of the Great Depression, resulted in a decline of volunteers and, as a result, the 33rd Battalion was amalgamated with the 35th Battalion to form the 35th/33rd Battalion. In 1933, the 35th/33rd was split and the 33rd joined with the 41st Battalion to form the 33rd/41st Battalion. They remained linked until October 1936, when the 33rd Battalion was reformed in its own right as part of an expansion of Australia's military force as tensions rose in Europe, raising concerns of a future war. During World War II, due to the provisions of the Defence Act, which precluded Militia units from being sent outside Australian territory to fight, the battalion remained in Australia undertaking garrison duties. Initially it served as part of the 1st Brigade, but in February 1942, following Japan's entry into the war, the 33rd Battalion was transferred to the 32nd Brigade, which formed part of the Newcastle Covering Force that had been tasked to defend against a possible Japanese invasion. On 27 August 1942, the battalion was linked with the 13th Battalion to become the 13th/33rd Battalion. It was disbanded on 25 November 1943 having not served outside Australia; the 33rd has remained off the Australian Army's order of battle since then. The battalion did not receive any battle honours for direct involvement in the war, but in 1961, the battalion was entrusted with the 20 battle honours earned by the 2/33rd Battalion, which was a Second Australian Imperial Force unit that fought in North Africa, Syria and the South West Pacific Area during World War II.

Online reference It consists of six acres of landscaped gardens sloping from the Langdale Chase Hotel to the shore of Windermere in Cumbria, in the Lake District of north west England. History The house was designed by J.L. Ball, J.T. Lee and Pattinson of Manchester and built as a private house in the late 19th century for Edna Howarth, the wife of a wealthy Manchester businessman. The gardens were planned and laid out by Thomas Hayton Mawson, a landscape architect of international distinction, who was also responsible for the gardens at the Peace Palace in the Hague. Following the death of Edna Howarth the house was acquired by the Willows family in 1914 and it then came into the ownership of the Dalzell family in 1930: they converted it into a hotel. Mrs Edna Howarth Edna Howarth (1848-1914) built Langdale Chase in 1891. She was born Edna Stopford in 1848 and was the daughter of Alfred Stopford who owned Stopford's Brewery Company in Manchester.Graces Guide website.

They lived at Heath House in Stretford. However he died in 1889 in Austria while they were touring the Continent.Manchester Courier and Lancashire General Advertiser - Monday 08 July 1889, p. 8. Shortly before he died George bought the Langdale Chase estate with the intention of building a small house as a summer residence.Lakes Herald - Friday 27 February 1914, p. 5. However after his death Edna decided to build a much larger house which took three years to complete. In 1891 a newspaper gave a description of the house which was nearing completion. They said. :\\"When the grounds are planted and laid out there will probably be no prettier residence in the district. The house is built of two kinds of stone-the dark blue stone of the district and a white freestone. Approaching the house the porch is a striking feature, adjoining which is a beautiful mullioned window, with stone panels, on which our artistic Manchester sculptor, Millson has carved the arms of various families. The hall itself is a charming part of the house. It is 21 feet in height, with a handsome carved oak staircase and galleries, and is lighted by the mullioned window already mentioned, filled with choicely designed stained glass, bearing heraldic devices. Off the main staircase is a flight of stairs leading to the Ladies' Bower, a pretty room over the porch. Further on is a winding staircase carrying the visitor to the billiard room. Still higher are the bedrooms and corridors, from which peeps of the hall may be obtained through charmingly designed arcades. The drawing room has a five-lighted bay window which runs up as a tower at the angle of the building. Indeed, each room has its own peculiar charm. In connection with the work of erecting the house, an interesting ceremony was performed on Saturday last by the daughter of Mrs Howarth, who placed on the turret the finial stone of the tower. When entirely completed the house will form one of the most beautiful of residences in the Lake District.\\"Manchester Times - Friday 04 September 1891, p. 8. Edna lived in the house with a staff of sixteen ‚Äì eight indoor servants and eight caring for the gardens, carriages and boats. One of her helpers was Emma Bertha Jones (1865-1937), a maiden lady from Canada who lived there as her companion for 22 years. In her will Edna left Emma 750 pounds and her five diamond hoop rings.Manchester Courier and Lancashire General Advertiser - Thursday 14 May 1914, p. 10. Edna‚Äôs daughter Lily married George Arthur Lorriman in 1891 and in 1892 they had a daughter who was named Lily Edna Lorriman (1892-1967). It was to her granddaughter that Edna left Langdale Chase when she died in 1914.Manchester Courier and Lancashire General Advertiser - Thursday 14 May 1914, p. 10. Soon after her death the house was sold to the Willow family. Later owners John Bouch Willows John Bouch Willows (1850-1924) who bought the house was born in Kingston upon Hull in 1850. His father was John Green Wills Willows founder of the large seed oil manufacturers Messrs Willows Holt and Willows in Hull. John entered the family firm and later became a partner. When the firm merged in to British Oil and Cake Company he became a Director of this firm. In 1878 he married Roberta Ann Dolphin Watts who was the daughter of John Edmund Watts, a lawyer from Edgbaston, Warwickshire. The couple had two children, a son and a daughter. The family lived in Hull for many years and then after John retired they moved to Scarborough. They then purchased Langdale Chase. He took a considerable interest in the fine arts and also music and drama.Hull Daily Mail - Tuesday 03 June 1924, p. 5. He died in 1924 and his wife Roberta continued to live at the house until her death in 1929. It was sold soon after her death and bought by the Dalzell family.

The ground was the home of Sussex County Cricket Club which had previously (1814‚Äì1847) been based at the Royal New Ground. In all, 64 first-class matches were played at the Royal Brunswick.CricketArchive The ground was used for many non-Sussex county matches, for example in 1864, a \\"Gentleman of Sussex\\" team played against a \\"Gentleman of South Wales\\" team, in 1866, county players played a match against a team including nine \\"Gentleman of the County\\" and nine \\"Colts of Sussex\\", and in 1866 the ground was used for a match between Brighton Cricket Club and Eashing Park Club. Since 1872, the club has been based at the County Cricket Ground, Hove, its present home.

A single instance of the name Norma is recorded 1203, where it perhaps derives from the Latin word norma, meaning \\"precept\\".

His material largely consists of discussing society, religion and politics such as feminism and liberalism. He has been acting in Swedish comedy shows such as Parlamentet, 100%, Veckans nyheter, Extra! Extra!, Stockholm live and in 2008 he made his own show called I ditt ansikte (In your Face). He has focused on his own 90-minute stand-up shows since then, with his 4th big tour playing over the winter 2011/2012. He is the only Swedish comedian to be awarded the \\"Swedish comedian of the year\\" award twice, in 2005 and 2010. With the 2010 award he was recognized as \\"the greatest in Sweden and on his way to becoming great in the United Kingdom\\". Betn√©r has been performing increasingly in English, in the US, UK and Ireland. In August 2010 Betn√©r performed a complete run of hour-length shows in English at The Stand Comedy Club during the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, receiving praise in mostly four star reviews. In 2012, Betn√©r hosted his own show on Kanal 5 called Betn√©r Direkt, which was inspired by shows like Real Time with Bill Maher and The Daily Show with Jon Stewart where Betn√©r discussed current events with a panel and a guest.  Early life  Betn√©r was born in Stockholm, son of Lennarth Betn√©r, then pastor in the Swedish Mission Church and mother, Susanne Betn√©r n√©e Bergman, then a housewife, now works at HSB. Because of his father's work Betn√©r moved around lot when he grew up. He lived in Idre, Sala and Ving√•ker before they moved back to Stockholm at age 14.  Comic style  Betn√©r uses dark comedy, often offensively, against Swedish celebrities such as Linda Rosing, Ebba von Sydow, Mikael Persbrandt, Per Gessle and many more. His stand-up comedy has garnered him much criticism and even death threats from Swedish neo-Nazis and rappers, but he finds it humorous that people can get so angry about jokes. Betn√©r often has to answer questions on why he is so offensive. He often replies that people should accept the jokes, since they are only jokes. Betn√©r was awarded the \\"Swedish comedian of the year\\" award in 2005 and again in 2010 in connection with the Swedish stand-up gala. Betn√©r's characteristic humour is often political and provocative; for example, in one show, he proposed to give his daughter a \\"pussy piercing\\" as a present for her second birthday, but ultimately opted against it, citing \\"why would you buy a pussy piercing for your two-year-old daughter? It would grow shut in a couple of weeks!\\" as the reason. Betn√©r has also released four DVD movies: Live fr√•n Norra Brunn (Live from Norra Brunn), Magnus Betn√©r UnCut, Inget √§r heligt (Nothing is sacred) and Tal till nationen (Speech to the nation). He later chose to discontinue appearing in the program Extra! Extra!, as he considered himself censored when they would not allow him to joke about Runar S√∏gaard. He has been visiting the TV programs Robins, F√∂rkv√§ll and Belinda. In the autumn of 2008, Betn√©r's own TV program I ditt ansikte (In your face) was broadcast on Channel 5 in Sweden. After that Betn√©r went on to make a permanent contribution to SVT's Debatt (Debate).  Personal life  Betn√©r lives with Helena Sandklef and has a daughter, Lina (born in 2005) from a previous marriage. Because of Betn√©r's dislike for tabloid newspapers, he almost never exposes himself in the media, but in some of his old acts he talked about his daughter. Sometimes when it comes to Christianity he refers to his father who is a pastor. Betn√©r however is an outspoken atheist and considers the world to be better off without religion. He identifies as bisexual and he believes that most people are.

In 1999 she published her first book, Milosevic, la diagonale du fou (Milosevic, the opposite of crazy), reissued by Gallimard in 2002. From October 2000 until October 2006 she was official spokesperson and Balkan adviser to Carla Del Ponte, chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in The Hague. On 19 July 2011, the Appeals Chamber of the ICTY upheld the first instance decision to convict Hartmann of contempt of court for the section of text called \\"Vital genocide documents concealed\\" in her book, Paix et Ch√¢timent, les guerres secr√®tes de la politique et de la justice internationales, which included the \\"legal reasoning\\" of two confidential appellate rulings of the UN Tribunal approving black-outs and exclusions from critical historical war documents showing Serbia's involvement in the Bosnian war of the 1990s. She was fined ‚Ç¨7,000 (¬£6,100). The fine was later converted into a seven-day prison sentence, for which the ICTY issued an arrest warrant.Florence Hartmann ICTY indictment, icty.org; accessed 15 April 2015. In December 2011, France refused to extradite her.France will not extradite former spokeswoman to ICTY, hurriyetdailynews.com; accessed 3 October 2015. Career Hartmann worked for eleven years for the French daily Le Monde as a journalist in charge of the Balkan desk. From January 1990 until May 1994, she was Le Monde correspondent for the former Yugoslavia. In 1999 she published her first book, Milosevic, la diagonale du fou (later reissued by Gallimard in 2002). From October 2000 until October 2006, Hartmann was official spokesperson and Balkan adviser to Carla Del Ponte, chief prosecutor of the ICTY at The Hague. Her book, Paix et ch√¢timent, Les guerres secr√®tes de la politique et de la justice internationales, regarding the politics of international justice and her version of how the ICTY and the ICTR functioned, was published by Parisian publisher Groupe Flammarion in September 2007. In 2014, she published a book on whistleblowers, Lanceurs d'alerte, les mauvaises consciences de nos d√©mocraties (published by Donquichotte Editions). In July 2015, she issued a book that reveals the role of the west in the runup to Srebrenica's fall, The Srebrenica Affair: The Blood of Realpolitik,Ed Vulliamy, \\"Revealed; The Role of The West in the Runup of The Srebrenica's Fall\\", The Observer, 5 July 2015. She was the first journalist to discover in October 1992 the existence and location of a mass grave at Ovƒçara (Croatia) containing the remains of 263 people who were taken from Vukovar's hospital to a nearby farm and killed on 20 November 1991 by Serb forces. On 25 May 2006, she gave evidence before the ICTY in the \\"Vukovar massacre case\\" against three Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) officers -- Mile Mrk≈°iƒá, Miroslav Radiƒá and Veselin ≈†ljivanƒçanin‚Äîwho had been indicted in relation to the Ovƒçara incident.Veselin ≈†ljivanƒçanin profile, sense-agency.com; accessed 6 July 2015. On 10 December 2011, Hartmann was given a lifetime achievement award for her contribution to the protection and promotion of human rights by the Croatian Helsinki Committee for Human Rights. Contempt of Court in the ICTY On 27 August 2008, Hartmann was indicted by the Tribunal for disclosing, in her book, Paix et ch√¢timent, Les guerres secr√®tes de la politique et de la justice internationales, confidential information pertaining to two decisions of the Tribunal approving blackouts and exclusions from critical historical war documents provided by Belgrade for the trial of the former Serbian President Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá and showing Serbia's involvement in the Srebrenica massacre. Hartmann posited that the ICTY Appeals Chamber had used invalid legal reasoning to effectively censor evidence which might have implicated Serbia-Montenegro in the alleged commission of genocide in Bosnia and Herzegovina during the 1990s Balkans wars. She specifically criticized the ICTY Appeals Chamber for improperly denying victims of mass atrocities the ability to access information critical to their ability to obtain reparations for crimes committed against them and their relatives. She argued that the war documents censored by the ICTY should have been made available during a separate trial at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in which Bosnia unsuccessfully tried to sue Serbia for genocide, because they could not prove a direct link between Belgrade and war crimes committed in Bosnia ‚Äì most notably the massacre of up to 8,000 Bosniak men and boys around Srebrenica in 1995. The Tribunal decision to grant confidentiality for the key portions of Belgrade war documents acknowledged that disclosure would harm Serbia's \\"vital national interests\\" by failing to protect Serbia from having to pay damages to Bosnia in Bosnia's suit then-pending at the ICJ. The issue at trial was whether the information she disclosed ‚Äì \\"the existence and the purported effect\\"Annex, pars 2‚Äì3 in ICTY's Order in lieu of an indictment against Florence Hartmann, icty.org; accessed 16 April 2015. of the two impugned confidential decisions of the ICTY Appeals Chamber‚Äôs dated 20 September 2005 and 6 April 2006 ‚Äì was confidential or whether only the key evidence Serbia sought to censor was protected by a Court order. On 14 September 2009, the ICTY found Hartmann guilty of contempt of court and was sentenced to pay a ‚Ç¨7,000 (¬£6,100) fine for disclosing information relating to the two confidential ICTY Court orders that deprive victims and public from access to documents on Serbia's involvement in planning and executing the Srebrenica genocide in 1995. While the Chamber found that \\"some protected information disclosed by the Accused in her publications was indeed in the public domain\\", it considered that she disclosed \\"more information, notably the legal reasoning applied by the Appeals Chamber in reaching its dispositions, as well as the purported effects of both Appeals Chamber decisions\\".Trial judgment, par. 33, icty.org; accessed 16 April 2015. She was convicted on these grounds of violating two appellate orders dated 20 September 2005 and 6 April 2006 issued in the Slobodan Miloseviƒá case before the ICTY. On 24 September 2009, Hartmann launched an appeal against the conviction. The London-based international NGO called Article 19, which is dedicated to the protection and promotion of freedom of speech submitted an amicus curiae brief, calling the ICTY Appeals Chamber to apply the international standards allegedly disregarded by the Trial Chamber. On 19 July 2011, the ICTY Appeals Chamber dismissed all the grounds of appeal advanced by Hartmann and confirmed the conviction, limiting it exclusively to the \\"disclosure of the legal reasoning of the two impugned confidential decisions\\". The imposition of the ‚Ç¨7,000 fine was upheld.Hartmann conviction challenged rejected, icty.org; accessed 15 April 2015., , Humanitarian Law Center, Regional Debate on the Judgement by the International Court of Justice, Transcript, Belgrade, 29 June 2007, pp. 25, 33‚Äì34, 37‚Äì38, 41 as well as in a number of press articles: IWPR TU N¬∞ 407, 17 May 2005, Special Investigation; [iwpr.net/report-news/justice-what-price Justice at What Price?

In March 2011, prior to the issuing of the appeal judgement against Hartmann, the impugned confidential decisions criticized by Hartmann were turned down. Most of the critical documents provided by Belgrade for the trial of Slobodan Miloseviƒá in relation to which confidentiality orders had initially been made were released by the ICTY and admitted as public evidence in the ICTY case against Momƒçilo Peri≈°iƒá, former Yugoslav Army chief of staff.Prosecutor v.

However, no ban was ordered in the ICTY Appeal judgment in relation to the three impugned pages of her book or her articles. In reaction to Hartmann's conviction by the ICTY, several international NGOs have criticized the ICTY for hiding its \\"legal reasoning\\" while the publicity of criminal proceedings is a general principle of criminal and international law which aim is to guarantee the transparency and public control of judicial proceedings. Reporters Without Borders and Article 19 condemned a conviction contravening international case law relating to freedom of expression. Reporters Without Borders stated that \\"it is the duty of the press to highlight how this internationally created system of justice works, to question its procedures and to stimulate public discussion\\".Arrest warrant against ex-spokeswoman smacks of revenge by Hague tribunal, rsf.org, 17 October 2011. \\"Article 19 believes that such an insistence on keeping the logic and effect of the ICTY's jurisprudence secret is profoundly undemocratic and manifestly inappropriate for an international criminal court\\", adding that \\"[t]o impose such a penalty on a journalist for bringing transparency and accountability to the ICTY raises troubling questions about the Tribunal's democratic legitimacy\\". The ‚Ç¨7,000 fine was deposited by Hartmann into a French dedicated bank account along with an invitation to the ICTY to seek assistance to the French authorities in order to collect these funds for the purposes of paying the fine. The ICTY Appeals Chamber deemed the money not to have been paid and converted, on 16 November 2011, the ‚Ç¨7,000 fine into a seven-day prison term. An arrest warrant for contempt of court was issued by the ICTY on the same day, ordering France to transfer immediately Hartmann to The Hague and the Netherlands to assist in taking her to the United Nations detention unit. The French government refused to extradite Hartmann and informed the ICTY of this refusal on 27 December 2011. In November 2011, Reporters Without Borders urged the French judiciary to determine the validity of the arrest warrant and to consider the merits of the case in accordance with the case law of the European Court of Human Rights. \\"The European Court of Human Rights has consistently emphasized the public interest in the reporting of legal issues. It would be illogical and dangerous if international justice was exempt.\\" On 30 November 2011, Article 19 denounced the unlawfulness of the arrest warrant and \\"calls on all states, particularly the French and Dutch authorities, to avoid complicity in this perversion of international justice and to resist carrying out the order\\". Article 19 insisted that the human rights guarantees enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) should take priority over the ICTY and recalled that under the case law of the European Court of Human Rights, French authorities as well as the authorities of the 46 other member states to the European Convention are obliged to verify the legality of the ICTY orders which they are asked to execute. Hartmann began petitioning Frank La Rue, United Nations Special Rapporteur for Freedom of Opinion and Expression, and Dunja Mijatoviƒá, the Representative for Freedom of the Media of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), on 30 November. As there is no appeal before an independent jurisdiction from a decision of the ICTY, Hartmann is seeking from the Special Rapporteurs a judgement that the ICTY decision against her violates international standards of protection of the right of freedom of expression and that upholding or executing the arrest warrant against her would constitute a further violation of this right. Reporters Without Borders called on both rapporteurs to remind international courts that they are subject to international norms, especially those concerning freedom of expression, noting that \\"[b]eyond the Hartmann case itself, the decision to penalize criticism of an international tribunal is a dangerous precedent for all those working in the media.\\" On 24 March 2016, Hartmann was arrested by UN guards as she gave an interview near the war crimes tribunal building.Mechanism arrests contempt convict (http://www.unmict.org, 24 March 2016)Former UN war crimes tribunal spokeswoman arrested at Karadzic hearing (www.dw.com, 24 March 2016) She was granted early release on 29 March 2016.Florence Hartmann Granted Early Release, unmict.org, 29 March 2016.

She has written a total of seven books and then primarily focused on illustrating. She has often collaborated with author Harriet Ziefert. Her method for creating illustrations is to use a combination of watercolors and a crayon resist technique. Collaboration with Harriet Ziefert = Benji books = One of the 1996 published books, Benjy Bear's Halloween, was made for children from 3 to 6 years-of-age. It comes with reusable stickers that allow the little one's to pretend and play with different Halloween scenarios.

Life  Hester van Eeghen was born in Amsterdam, the youngest of five children. Her family has been involved in the arts in The Netherlands in one way or another since the 17th century. She studied literature at the University of Amsterdam, and soon got involved with theatre, acting, and producing musicals. It was during that time she also started designing bags and working with leather. She learned the technical craft of leather construction by working with a suitcase designer who encouraged her to perfect the smallest details. She scraped together money to buy small pieces of leather, and created bags, one by one, which she sold in local street markets. With each bag she sold she would buy more leather, make more bags, and so on, until she finally was able to open her shop at 37 Hartenstraat.  Work  Her designs are for sale in over 150 museums and design stores over the world and are sold in several countries like Germany, the UK, Japan and the USA. She is regarded as one of the influential Dutch designers of the 20th century. Van Eeghen has designed collections for other brands such as Paco Rabanne, Marlboro Classics, Jaguar, Castelijn en Berens. Her work was published in over 200 interviews in magazines (NRC Handelsblad, Volkskrant, International Herald Tribune, San Francisco Chronicle, Trouw, Het Parool, De Telegraaf, Het Financieel Dagblad ‚Äì HP/De Tijd, Vrij Nederland, Art Aurea, Holland Herald etc..), television and radio. It is listed in an inventory of Dutch Design in the 20th Century (Ton Lauwen 2003).  Foundation  Both in 1998 and 2008 at the occasion of her first and second decade in design, Hester van Eeghen created a collection of 24 unique pieces that were auctioned at Sotheby's Amsterdam, with the proceeds going to the Foundation Hester van Eeghen Leather Design. Every two years, the Foundation organises a competition in collaboration with the Museum of Bags and Purses as a stimulus for designers who work with leather. The theme of the competition focuses on the historical collection of the museum, for example the 2010 theme is Dine & Date. The winner of the Leather Design Prize will have their design produced in a series of 30 pieces. It is an opportunity for the designer to become familiar with the entire process from design to end product. In 2008, after 20 years of designing, Hester was made a Knight in the Order of Orange-Nassau and given the decorations by the Mayor of Amsterdam Job Cohen for her contribution to Dutch Design.

The line became a joint North British Railway and Caledonian Railway operation in 1880, and so was run as a joint London and North Eastern Railway and London, Midland and Scottish Railway after the Grouping of 1923. Although passenger services ceased after seven years of this management the goods service passed on to the Scottish Region of British Railways on nationalisation in 1948, and was not withdrawn by the British Railways Board until 1975.

The failed abduction attempt led police to his involvement in the triple murder. Early life Coulston grew up on his family's dairy farm in Tangambalanga. His family were described as law abiding. On 19 April 1971 Coulston, aged 14 years and armed with a .22 rifle, abducted from a house next to the Tangambalanga school, two 22-year-old female school teachers whom he had kept under surveillance prior to the abduction. He stole some money and forced the two women into one of their cars and made them drive him interstate towards Sydney. At 5am the next day, the vehicle stopped at a Gundagai roadhouse for food. The women escaped and attracted attention to their situation. Arrested, Coulston was sent by the Children's Court to Turana Youth Training Centre. Publicity of the abductions made the family sell its farm a year or so later and move interstate to New South Wales buying a dairy in Kyogle. Later, his father retired selling the dairy and moved to a property on Brisbane's southern outskirts. Coulston joined his family in Brisbane in 1979. Trans-Tasman voyages In 1988, Coulston came to media attention when he attempted to sail his custom built vessel which he named G'Day 88 from Australia to New Zealand across the Tasman Sea. On 26 January 1988, Coulston left Port Stephens in G'Day 88, a vessel he designed and built himselfG'day 88, Microyachts in the Tasman however he ran into troubles following Cyclone Bola and on 12 March 1988, activated his vessel's emergency beacon. He was rescued by a passing tanker just north of New Zealand's North Island after spending 46 days at sea in stormy weather. The remains of his vessel washed up on the New Zealand shore several months later. He was dubbed \\"Captain Bathtub\\". On 25 October 1988, Coulston attempted his voyage once again sailing from New Zealand to Australia, successfully arriving in Brisbane on 6 January 1989. Criminal activities Triple murder Coulston returned to live in Victoria in 1989. On 29 July 1992, two students advertised in the Herald Sun newspaper for a tenant to share their home in Burwood after a housemate decided to leave the premises and return home to live with their parents. Kerryn Henstridge, 22, Anne Smerdon, 22, and Peter Dempsey, 27, the brother- in-law of one of the women, were forced into separate rooms and hogtied using cable ties before Coulston shot them execution style in the back of the head with a sawn-off .22 rifle fitted with a home-made silencer made from an oil filter. Attempted abduction On 1 September 1992, Coulston armed himself with the same weapon used to commit the earlier murders and some cable ties, then drove to St Kilda Road and parked his car near the National Gallery of Victoria. He then approached a couple and attempted to abduct them. The couple offered Coulston their money, which he took. He then proceeded to restrain the couple using the cable ties. Whilst attempting to restrain the female he was overpowered by the male who had grabbed the rifle and threw it aside allowing the couple to escape and raise the alarm with two nearby security guards. The security guards gave chase however Coulston fired at the guards, hitting one in the hip. Coulston was eventually arrested by police at the scene and taken into custody. The rifle used in the abduction attempt would later link Coulston to the triple murders in Burwood several months earlier and in addition the cable ties were the same. Trial He was originally sentenced to three consecutive life sentences with a non-parole period of 30 years, but was granted a retrial on the murder charges after appeal; he was re-sentenced to seven years on appeal, increased from four years six months, by the Crown on the remaining nine charges. Coulston did not speak at all during either trial, and was sentenced to three consecutive life sentences, to be served cumulatively with the seven-year sentence for the remaining offences; Justice Norman O'Bryan refused to fix a non-parole period, calling the murders \\"cold- blooded\\", \\"heinous\\" and \\"wicked\\", and telling Coulston that \\"you have forfeited forever your entitlement to live outside the confines of a prison\\". No motive was established for the murders as Coulston exercised his right to remain silent and both a defence psychologist and psychiatrist found normal intelligence and no psychological disturbance or personality disorder with Coulston. Prison life Detained at HM Prison Barwon, in 2005 it was reported that Coulston had collected fifteen television images of the assault of a fully clothed woman. The images were stored on his personal computer. Suspect in other crimes In 2000, the Australian Police Journal published an article on Coulston regarding the forthcoming creation of the National Criminal Investigation DNA Database (NCIDD) and that the Queensland Police Service and the New South Wales Police Force were seeking to recover DNA samples from the \\"Balaclava Killer\\" and the \\"Sutherland Rapist\\" cases to compare with Coulston's DNA. Coulston shared the same rare blood type of group A secretor with the \\"Balaclava Killer\\" and the \\"Sutherland Rapist\\". The \\"Balaclava Killer\\" had raped several women armed with a sawn-off .22 rifle often while their bound male partner watched in the Gold Coast, Queensland between December 1979 and October 1980. The attacker used a motorbike to leave the scene of one attack. In February 1980, an attack occurred at Tweed Heads, a male partner Jeffrey Parkinson fought back and was shot dead allowing his unharmed female companion to flee. Coulston had lived with his family in nearby Brisbane since 1979 and in late 1980 Coulston moved from Brisbane to southern Sydney in Cronulla and at times lived in Bexley, Kingsgrove and Oatley between 1980 and 1987. In the 1980s, in Sydney‚Äôs southern suburbs women were attacked by an attacker dubbed the \\"Sutherland Rapist\\" and which is now understood by police to be at least two separate attackers. One of whom had the blood type of group A secretor who committed offences between 1985 and 1987 in the Sutherland Shire and Hurstville including targeting couples in lovers' lanes bounding their male partners armed with a sawn-off shotgun wearing several disguises. In 1986, Coulston was sacked from the company he had worked for since 1980 and he spent most of 1987 and his savings of $10,000 constructing the yacht, G'day 88, in a backyard in southern Sydney.

History Originally, the river flowed into a wetland at the current region of Minuma. In 1629, a civil engineering project by created a reservoir and blocked the flow. In 1727, the reservoir levee was demolished to open up the area for creating rice paddies. In 1728, the lowest sections of the area were gouged to allow for the passage of water, which set the current position of the river. Water quality The water quality of the river is poor, since it flows through urban areas.

Boucher was an adaptable player, who although selected mainly as a forward, often played at centre. He was strong, quick for his position and passed well on the run. He was often noted for his kicking skills and kicked several drop goals each season even as a forward.Thomas (1979), pg 17. Boucher was one of the last great all-round Welsh players before positional specialisation was adopted. Boucher played for the invitational Barbarians and became their club secretary between 1894 and 1899. He is the maternal grandfather of Dick King-Smith. Rugby career Born in Gobowen in England, Boucher moved to Wales while still young. He joined Newport during the 1889/90 season and in the following decade he captained them over three seasons. Boucher was part of Newport's invincible 1891/92 season alongside the legendary Arthur Gould, though Boucher actually played more games. Boucher was first selected to play for Wales on 2 January 1892 against England. He was brought in with fellow Newport forward Wallace Watts, and the two were selected to play in the same squad on ten occasions. The Welsh team were beaten soundly by England, and failed to win any of the games in that season's Championship. The next season Boucher played his role in winning Wales's very first Triple Crown, and by 1897 he had collected 13 caps, missing two games in between only due to injuries. In his final game for Wales against England, Boucher scored his first and only try for his country, and due to the Gould Affair Wales played no further games that season.

It contributed to the religious pamphlet war of the time, and was Donne's first appearance in print. It argued that English Roman Catholics should take the Oath of Allegiance of James I of England.Achsah Guibbory (editor), The Cambridge Companion to John Donne (2006), p. 91; Google Books. It was printed by William Stansby for Walter Burre. Background Donne had converted from Catholicism, but had not moved decisively into the Protestant camp. From 1604 he became involved in controversial theology as an onlooker, assisting his friend Thomas Morton in a reply to James Anderton, commissioned by Richard Bancroft.John Stubbs, Donne: The Reformed Soul (2007), p. 236.Malcolm Hardman, A Kingdom in Two Parishes: Lancashire religious writers and the English monarchy, 1521-1689 (1998), p. 175; Google Books. The content of Pseudo- Martyr Donne entered directly into one of the major debates of the period, supporting Sir Edward Coke against the Jesuit Robert Parsons. Coke in Fift Part of the Reports (1606) had made a historical argument on the powers of the King of England in church matters.Anthony Raspa, Pseudo-Martyr: wherein out of certaine propositions and gradations, this conclusion is evicted that those which are of the Romane religion in this kingdome, may and ought to take the oath of allegiance (1993 edition), p. 271 notes to p.9, and p. 278; Google Books. Donne characterised the English mission, of Catholic priests trained to convert Protestants and sustain English Catholics, as \\"enemies to the dignity of all princes\\", and seditious because of the theories of temporal power of the Pope supported particularly by the Jesuits.Olga L. Valbuena, Subjects to the King's Divorce: equivocation, infidelity, and resistance in early modern England (2003), p. 26;Google Books. Donne used a comparison with the Circumcellions to denigrate Jesuit attitudes to martyrdom.Susannah Brietz Monta, Martyrdom and Literature in Early Modern England (2005), p. 138; Google Books. A more subtle side to the argument is that it recognised that the oath had closed down the option of passive obedience to the king. Donne threw the onus of swearing onto individual conscience, discounting both arguments from the state and the authority of casuistry. The only acceptable basis was scripture and knowledge of nature, the duty of obedience being considered in the light of natural law.Rebecca Lemon, Treason by Words: Literature, law, and rebellion in Shakespeare's England (2008), p. 126; Google Books. Intention and reception Pseudo-Martyr launched Donne into a career as a clergyman of the Church of England, one of the reasons he wrote it. He also aimed it at English Catholics. The work influenced Thomas James, who praised it.Johann P. Somerville, John Donne the Controversialist: The Poet as Political Thinker, p. 94, in David Colclough (editor), John Donne's Professional Lives (2003); Google Books.

They were often sold alongside PA-RISC-based HP 9000 Unix systems. The primary use case was connecting several graphical consoles to a single server or workstation to allow multiple users access the same (expensive) processing system from (less expensive) terminal systems. These X-Terminals all allowed high-resolution, color-graphics access to the main server from which they downloaded their operating system and necessary program files. All models featured limited expandability, in most cases additional I/O options for peripherals and memory for more programs or local storage. HP did not use its own PA-RISC platform for these systems, the first design used an Intel CISC processor, while all later systems used RISC platforms, first Intel i960 and later the popular MIPS. These 1990s X-Terminals, together with offerings from many other vendors from that time, were precursors to thin computing: the use of small dumb front-end systems for I/O and a larger processing system as back-end, shared by many concurrent users. 700/X These were the first X-Terminals HP produced, featuring a similar case to that of some HP 9000/300 (Motorola 68000-based) workstations. They were driven by a pretty obscure CPU combination, an Intel 186 with a TI DSP as video coprocessor. * CPU: 16 MHz Intel 80186 with a 60 MHz Texas Instruments DSP as video processor * RAM: 1MB on board, 9MB maximum; one slot takes up to 8MB modules of unknown type * Video RAM: Unknown * Maximum video resolution/color-depth: 1024√ó768/8-bit * I/O connectors: RS-232 serial, HIL and two PS/2 for keyboard/mouse devices, AUI and BNC 10 Mbit Ethernet connectors and VGA video connector * Expansion: Unknown 700/RX HP 700/RX C2708B These are the direct successors to the 700/X line of X-Terminals and changed the architecture significantly. They were the first in a line of terminals to be driven by an Intel i960 RISC CPU and introduced a case which also was used on later systems. They have a (albeit very quiet) fan. Several submodels were available, featuring different video-options: * 16Ca: 1 MB video RAM, max. 1028√ó768 resolution, 8-bit color-depth * 19Ca: 2 MB video RAM, max. 1280√ó1024 resolution, 8-bit color-depth * 14Ci/16Ci/17Ci: 1 MB video RAM, max. 1028√ó768 resolution, 8-bit color-depth * 19Mi: 0.2 MB video RAM, max. 1280√ó1024 resolution, monographics All models have these base features in common: * CPU: 22 MHz Intel i960CA with 1KB instruction cache * RAM: 2 MB on board, 34 MB maximum; two slots take each up to 16 MB 72-pin non-parity SIMMs * I/O connectors: RS232 serial, HIL and two PS/2 for keyboard/mouse devices, parallel for printer, AUI and BNC 10 Mbit Ethernet and VGA video connector * Expansion: slot for a Boot-ROM cartridge Entria The Entrias were the low- cost line of X-Terminals, featuring the same architecture as the 700/RX terminals, but in a plastic case the same style as the HP 9000/712 workstation. They are very small and quiet. The Entrias were available in different video configurations, depending on the exact model: * 0.6 MB video RAM: max. resolution of 1024√ó768 with grayscale graphics * 1 MB video RAM: max. resolution of 1024√ó768 with 8-bit color depth * 2 MB video RAM: max. resolution of 1280√ó1024 with 8-bit color depth Common: * CPU: Intel i960CA with 1 KB instruction cache * RAM: 4 MB on board, 68 MB maximum; two slots take each up to 32 MB 72-pin non-parity SIMMs * I/O connectors: RS-232 serial, two PS/2 for keyboard/mouse devices, parallel for printer, TP and BNC 10 Mbit Ethernet and VGA video connector * Expansion: none Envizex The Envizex were the successors to the 700/RX terminals, featuring the same flat pizzabox case and a slightly modified architecture with a faster version of the Intel i960 RISC CPU. They have a (very quiet) fan inside. Three different series were available which featured different speeds of the CPU: * i SERIES: 25 MHz Intel i960CF with 4 KB instruction and 1 KB data cache * a SERIES: 28 MHz Intel i960CF with 4 KB instruction and 1 KB data cache * p SERIES: 33 MHz Intel i960CF with 4 KB instruction and 1 KB data cache Common aspects: * RAM: a and i SERIES: 4 MB on board, 132 MB maximum; four slots take each up to 32 MB 72-pin non-parity SIMMs. p SERIES: 6 MB on board, 102 MB maximum; three slots take each up to 32 MB 72-pin non-parity SIMMs * Video RAM: 2 MB * Maximum video resolution/color-depth: 1280√ó1024 (i SERIES might do only 1024√ó768) 8-bit * I/O connectors: two RS-232 serial, HIL and two PS/2 for keyboard/mouse devices, parallel for printer, TP, AUI and BNC 10 Mbit Ethernet and VGA video connector * Expansion: They offer a range of expansion options: ** 3.5‚Ä≥ PC floppy drive ** CD-quality audio support ** Either one of the following three cards: *** SCSI/ROM adapter card *** Token Ring adapter *** 100VG AnyLan adapter (HP-proprietary 100 MBit networking) ** They also have two PCMCIA sockets for: *** Boot-ROM card *** SRAM cards which contain fonts or a local copy of the X server (no network download necessary) Entria II These were the successors of the low-cost Entria X-Terminals, keeping their HP 9000/712-style small footprint plastic case. The system architecture was changed completely and is shared with the later Envizex II terminals. It is based around a NEC R4300 CPU and PCI-based I/O devices. * CPU: 100 MHz NEC R4300 * RAM: 64 MB maximum; two slots take each up to 32 MB 168-pin DIMMs (PC66/100/133 DIMMs in different sizes can be used, but only 8 MB of each module will be available; the larger modules (16 and 32 MB) were HP- proprietary) * Video RAM: 2 MB * Maximum video resolution/color-depth: 1280√ó1024/8-bit * I/O connectors: RS-232 serial, two PS/2 for keyboard/mouse devices, parallel for printer, TP Ethernet (probably 10 Mbit) connector and VGA video connector * Expansion: none Envizex II These are the bigger brothers of the Entria II X-Terminals, driven by the same R4300 MIPS CPU and PCI I/O architecture. The case was redesigned, is very easy to open and does not have any fans, making the terminal rather quiet. * CPU: 133 MHz NEC R4300 * RAM: 96 MB maximum; three slots take each up to 32 MB 168-pin DIMMs (PC66/100/133 DIMMs in different sizes can be used, but only 8 MB of each module will be available; the larger modules (16 and 32 MB) were also HP- proprietary) * Video RAM: 2 or 4 MB VSIMM * Video chipset: ATI Mach64 * Maximum video resolution/color-depth: 1600√ó1200/16-bit * I/O connectors: two RS-232 serial, two PS/2 and USB for keyboard/mouse devices, TP Ethernet connector and EVC video connector (requires an adapter-cable to use standard VGA monitors) * Expansion: ** 3.5‚Ä≥ PC floppy drive ** Audio Kit with telephone I/O ** Flash DIMMs card for booting and storing configuration and font files ** 100VG AnyLan PCI card ** 100 Mbit Ethernet PCI card ** Combined BNC and AUI card (expands the onboard NIC) Software These X-Terminals/stations run a proprietary operating system from HP ‚Äî Netstation, formerly Enware, with some versions apparently based on VxWorks (probably those with RISC support). This software runs on theoretically any Unix system, native support is available for HP-UX 10, HP-UX 11, IBM AIX and Solaris 2.x. A generic installation image is provided for other Unix flavors; this can be used to install the software via the provided installation shell script on for instance various Linux or BSD flavors. Netstation Version 7.1 The older Enware/Netstation Version 7.1, HP product B.07.11, supports the following i960-based terminals: * 700/RX * Entria * Envizex It was downloadable from a public HP FTP service (hprc.external.hp.com/B.07.11/), which however was apparently discontinued.Last tested September 2008. Read the included documentation and technical reference and refer to the installation instructions. Generally, a Unix server is needed from which the station can boot its kernel and load its X server. This is done via TFTP; the station can be managed locally via a configuration screen or remotely on the server via customizable configuration files. Netstation Version 9.0 The most current available Netstation version is 9.0, HP product B.09.11. This version supports the newer MIPS-based X-Terminals: * Entria II * Envizex II Same as with the older Netstation software, version 9.0 was available from a HP FTP service, which was discontinued. (See above) The newer X-Terminals (IIs) can boot in different ways, over a NFS mount, a SMB share or plain TFTP. Included in the Netstation software is a native Java environment which makes execution of local Java applets on the terminal possible.

She appeared in more than 70 films between 1960 and 1998. Biography  Early life  Born in Fossola, a frazione of Carrara, Giorgelli was the daughter of a businessman in the marble industry and a housewife. As a child her parents separated and she moved to Castelpoggio, another of Carrara's frazione and her mother's birthplace. Due to her mother's economic difficulties, at ten years of age, young old Gabriella was entrusted to the college of the Sisters of Capulet, in Carrara. At fifteen years old she started to work, including as a pizza chef and a bartender.  Career  Giorgelli made her film debut in 1960, in a very minor role in Luigi Comencini's Everybody Go Home. After winning several local and regional beauty contests, in 1961 she was among the finalists of Miss Italia, and thanks to her participation to the popular beauty pageant she started to attract a significant media attention, that allowed her to get more weighty film roles. After appearing in several art films, in the late 1960s Giorgelli landed some leading roles in B-movies, mainly consisting of Spaghetti Westerns and Commedia sexy all'italiana films spoofing Pier Paolo Pasolini's The Decameron, that she alternated with supporting roles in more prestigious and high-profile productions.

As is traditional with such documents, it takes its title from the opening words of the original Latin text, meaning \\"that momentous\\". Benedict begins by recalling \\"that momentous and holy charge\\" found in Mark 16:15: \\"Go into the whole world and preach the gospel to all creation.\\" It identified the principles and priorities of the Catholic missions. It represented a break with Eurocentric and colonialist thought. It proposed instead an appreciation for cultural differences, a separation of the Church's work from political alliances, and the need to develop the resources of local churches to thrive independently once the missionaries withdraw in favor of an indigenous priesthood and episcopacy. It established, according to Cardinal Fernando Filoni, that \\"the Church could no longer be linked to the reality of that moment where there were so many nationalisms and the desire to promote a certain colonialism through religion: a union that had to be broken. The Catholic missionary, Pope Benedict XV said, presents himself as an ambassador of Christ, not as a messenger of his own nation.\\" Though not an encyclical, it is sometimes identified as the first of five papal encyclicals issued between 1919 and 1959 that redefined the Church‚Äôs missionary role. The others are Rerum Ecclesiae (Pius XI, 1926), Evangelii praecones (Pius XII, 1951), Fidei donum (Pius XII, 1957), and Princeps pastorum (John XXIII, 1959). Background In the second half of the 19th century, the Vatican recognized the need to overhaul the administration and spirit of missionary activities. Pope Leo XIII and Pope Pius X both tried to curb the authority of the French- dominated Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. The Belgian missionary to China Fr√©d√©ric-Vincent Lebbe campaigned for the appointment of indigenous bishops to replace French missionary bishops. He immersed himself in Chinese culture from the time of his arrival and ordination in 1901, learning the language and adopting native attire. He criticized various foreign religious organizations for the practice of controlling Chinese Catholicism to the benefit of their home countries, proposing the slogan \\"Return China to the Chinese and the Chinese will go to Christ\\". He angered his superiors in the Lazarist order by promoting the appointment of bishops of Chinese nationality. At the same time, the ongoing rivalries of the European powers in Africa and Asia presented a challenge to the missionary enterprise, and the conclusion of World War I represented a break with the colonial past, as the Treaty of Versailles established mandates under the authority of the League of Nations that anticipated an end to colonial rule. Content Benedict recalled the great apostles of the Gospel who contributed much to the expansion of missions. He reviewed the recent history of the missions. The encyclical first turned to the bishops and superiors in charge of the Catholic missions, noting the need to train local clergy. Catholic missionaries are reminded that their goal is a spiritual one, which must be carried out in a selfless way. The pope underlined the necessity of proper preparation for the work in foreign cultures and the need to acquire language skills before going there. He requests a continued striving for personal sanctity and praises the selfless work of female religious in the missions. Mission is not only for missionaries: all Catholics must participate, through their Apostolate of Prayer, by supporting vocations, and by helping financially. The encyclical concludes by pointing out several organizations which organize and supervise mission activities within the Catholic Church. Noting the end of World War I, Benedict repeated the biblical mandate to go to the ends of the earth and preach the gospel. He recalled the examples of Francis Xavier in India and Bartolom√© de las Casas in the Americas and others to show what individuals can do in the service of God. Many missionaries died as martyrs for their faith and many live like saints. He noted great success to date: \\"Anyone who studies the facts of this great saga cannot help being profoundly impressed by them: by all the stupendous hardships our missionaries have undergone in extending the Faith, the magnificent devotion they have shown, and the overwhelming examples of intrepid endurance they have afforded us. And to anyone who weighs these facts the realization must come as a shock that right now, there still remain in the world immense multitudes of people who dwell in darkness and in the shadow of death. According to a recent estimate, the number of non- believers in the world approximates one billion souls.\\" He emphasized the need for missionaries to develop local clergy to extend their work. Anyone who has charge of a mission must to secure and train local candidates for the ministry: \\"In this policy lies the greatest hope of the new churches. For the local priest, one with his people by birth, by nature, by his sympathies and his aspirations, is remarkably effective in appealing to their mentality and thus attracting them to the Faith. Far better than anyone else he knows the kind of argument they will listen to, and as a result, he often has easy access to places where a foreign priest would not be tolerated.\\" Reception Benedict's message divided the French missions in China into a \\"Lebbe faction\\" and a \\"French faction\\". The leadership of one of the most prominent missionary orders, the German Society of the Divine Word, which itself had contributed to the anti-European Chinese uprising known as the Boxer Rebellion, criticized Lebb√© and doubted that suitable Chinese candidates could be readied for episcopal ordination promptly. Some resisted the Vatican through inaction or argued that the protected legal status granted foreigners in China gave the missionaries a more secure position than any indigenous clergy could enjoy. Many nevertheless recognized that ordaining growing numbers of Chinese nationals to the priesthood was creating greater rivalry than rapprochement with their European counterparts. Benedict's successor Pius XI continued to press for a new approach to missionary work. In 1922 he appointed as Apostolic Delegate to China Celso Costantini, who persuaded two European-born bishop to yield territory to allow for the appointment of two indigenous Chinese as apostolic vicars in 1924. Costantini identified six indigenous Chinese candidates for episcopal appointments and accompanied them to Rome where they received their episcopal consecration from Pius on 28 October 1926. Pius reinforced the principles of Maximum illud in his encyclical Rerum ecclesiae of 8 February 1926. In some regions progress came more quickly. Pius named the first India-born bishop of the Latin rite, the Jesuit Francis T. Roche, in 1923. By the time of his death in 1939, Pius had appointed forty indigenous bishops in missionary lands, the first of the modern era. Later development of Catholic doctrine requires a revision of Benedict's assertion in Maximum illud that the missions targeted those who \\"lived in ignorance of God, and thus, bound by the chains of their blind and violent desires, are enslaved in the most hideous of all forms of slavery, the service of Satan\\". The Church's view of other religions since Nostra aetate (1965) recognizes shared values and encourages respectful dialog. Later recognition In 2017, Pope Francis noted the approaching centennial of this apostolic letter and called for October 2019 to be celebrated as an \\"Extraordinary Missionary Month\\". He noted that in Maximum illud Benedict tried to promote evangelization \\"purified of any colonial overtones and kept far away from the nationalistic and expansionistic aims that had proved so disastrous\\". He wrote: \\"The Apostolic Letter Maximum illud called for transcending national boundaries and bearing witness, with prophetic spirit and evangelical boldness, to God's saving will through the Church‚Äôs universal mission.\\" The idea for special recognition of the Church's missionary work derived from a proposal by the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples that called for renewed consideration of Ad gentes, a 1965 decree of the Second Vatican Council on the missionary activity of the Church. He described Maximum illud as a milestone in the evolution of the Church's missionary work: Archbishop Giampietro Dal Toso, president of the Pontifical Mission Societies, said the missionary renewal was linked to the Synod of Bishops on the Amazon scheduled to take place the same month.

It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 9, 2008. The episode received mixed reviews from television critics. Plot On the Fourth of July, the Simpson family visit a cabin in the woods. While driving there, they pick up hitchhikers Squeaky Voiced Teen and his girlfriend, Beatrice. Homer flashes back twenty years earlier, when he and Marge ride their bikes down a highway. While trying to kiss, Homer crashes his bike, forcing them to walk. Ned and Maude Flanders driving by, see them and pick them up. Ned and Maude reveal they are married, but having some marital problems and, seeing this, Homer proposes to 'not' marry Marge. Back in the present, Homer becomes annoyed with the Squeaky Voiced Teen kissing Beatrice, prompting another flashback. In their married years five years later, Homer and Marge are more stressed. Driving with Marge, Patty and Selma, and getting the usual flak from the latter two, Homer angrily kicks them out of the car, unaware they had the map to their cabin destination. The car runs out of gas and Homer and Marge walk off with a gas can, stopping at a home to use the phone. The owner, Alberto, is having a party, and he invites them in. Marge becomes enraged after seeing Homer flirting with a beautiful woman named Sylvia. Following an argument, Marge accidentally falls into the pool. Homer starts a sushi fight, and Marge regrets marrying Homer. In the present, the family drops off the Squeaky-Voiced Teen and Beatrice, and continue to their cabin. Homer and Marge flash back to their dating years, when Flanders brought them along to the same cabins. Flanders barricades unmarried Homer and Marge chastely in separate rooms. In their married years, Marge leaves the party with Alberto, while Homer drives off with Sylvia. They each end up at the cabins. Alberto and Sylvia fall in love while Homer and Marge rekindle their love. In the present, Homer and Marge meet Alberto and Sylvia, now married with a daughter named Ruthie and learn of each other's near-affairs. Marge is disgusted, but Homer points out she was just as bad as he was. Homer regrets marrying Marge and, trapped in a ball of their luggage which happened while unpacking, has Ruthie roll him into the woods. Back in their dating years, Ned tells Homer that if he was married to Marge, he could make all the love to her he wants. Taking a walk through the woods with Marge, Homer carves the message \\"Marge + Homer 4ever\\" into a tree. In the present, Homer sees this message, then Marge arrives and accidentally knocks the tree over a ravine. Homer clings onto the bark and falls down the ravine toward the river below with Marge falling after. They are saved by Bart and Lisa in their pedal car, which Bart had accidentally driven into the river. Cultural references The episode's non-linear plot showing various points in Homer and Marge's relationship is a reference to the 1967 film Two for the Road, starring Audrey Hepburn and Albert Finney, and the episode's musical score mimics the film's Henry Mancini score. Homer, Sylvia and Dr. Hibbert sing the Chubby Checker song \\"Limbo Rock\\", while a water-soaked Marge resembles Cousin Itt from The Addams Family. Toucan Sam, Trix, Cap'n Crunch and Count Chocula are all featured on Bart's Cereal Killer game; they are, respectively, the mascots for Froot Loops, Trix, Cap'n Crunch and Count Chocula breakfast cereals. The handheld system Bart is playing on is a Game Boy Advance. Reception Since airing, the episode has received mixed reviews from television critics. Robert Canning of IGN said, \\"I did find Bart and Lisa as the bickering couple...to be very funny. It added a fresh twist to this generally stale outing. ...There were other fun laughs...but none of that could make up for the poor story being told or the overall unfunniness of the episode.\\" He gave this episode a 5.8. Daniel Aughey of TV Guide said, \\"[It was the] Worst. Episode. Ever. I found the events of this week's episode so simplistic that I was utterly confused.\\" He went on to say, \\"The story was stitched together and never really had any momentum.\\" Erich Asperschlager of TV Verdict wrote: \\"I‚Äôve always enjoyed The Simpsons flashback episodes. The best of them tickle a nostalgic funny bone, but 'Dangerous Curves' doesn‚Äôt really fit with those episodes, though. The story of Homer and Marge‚Äôs marriage weathering a serious storm would be a lot more compelling if we hadn‚Äôt seen it before. I‚Äôm glad the writers feel they can write character-based stories after 19 years. I just wish they‚Äôd stop repeating themselves.

Bennett was a right-handed middle-order batsman who played for Surrey's second eleven in 1937, and might have played more for Surrey but for a mistake at the start of the 1946 season. According to a published history of the county club, Surrey, casting around for an amateur captain to lead the side in the hastily arranged first season of first-class cricket after the war, alighted on the name \\"Major Bennett\\". The intention appears to have been to offer the job to Leo Bennett, but instead, another club cricketer, Major Nigel Harvie Bennett, who had also played a few second eleven matches pre-war, was asked and he accepted the job. Most of Leo Bennett's cricket was at club level, where he was a prominent player over many seasons and a frequent player and captain in the minor warm-up matches for the Club Cricket Conference against touring sides; he was also the captain for the BBC cricket team. During the Second World War, however, Bennett played alongside some bigger cricketing names in matches for, among others, the British Empire XI, although these games were not first-class. In 1947 and the following two seasons, he turned out in a total of 16 first-class matches for Northamptonshire, making useful runs in his first and last seasons. His best match came against Nottinghamshire at Northampton in August 1947, when he scored 56 in the first innings and 68 in the second, his two highest first- class scores. Northamptonshire still lost the match by a large margin. His obituary in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack credits him with a book on club cricket, and he appears to have moved in exalted cricketing circles in his latter life. As late as 1962 and 1963, he was captaining Lord's Taverners teams in less-than-serious matches at Lord's: players who turned out under his captaincy included Keith Miller, David Sheppard and Norman Wisdom. Bennett was commissioned into the Royal Fusiliers in June 1943, but later transferred to the Worcestershire Regiment. He was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in 1945 for his war service.

He has represented Great Britain at six Summer Paralympics winning seven gold medals across swimming and cycling events. He has also competed in multiple World Championships, winning 22 medals. Personal history Cundy was born in Wisbech, Cambridgeshire to Alan, a fitter-welder, and Ann, an accountancy clerk. He grew up in Norfolk along with his younger brother Ashley. Cundy was born with a deformed foot, which was amputated when he was three years old. Swimming career When Cundy was aged 10, his parents met a disabled girl's parents and they discussed disability swimming. After some research, Cundy's parents decided to get him involved. Cundy showed early potential, breaking swimming records for his age group. After become a leading member of his local King's Lynn club's team, he made his international debut at the Swimming World Championships in Malta in 1994. \\"I was,\\" he recalls, \\"a rank outsider. I knocked four seconds off my personal best and won the world 100m butterfly title at the first attempt.\\" But he was, he says, \\"never a naturally gifted swimmer. I don't have the build. I just worked very hard: 10 or 11 two-hour sessions in the pool each week, and weights and core strength work ‚Äì 30 hours-plus a week.\\" He later became a top athlete, and represented Great Britain three times in swimming at the Paralympic Games from 1996 to 2004, winning three gold and two bronze medals.\\"Paralympic challengers: Jody Cundy\\" , BBC, 2 September 2008 After a 2004 Athens Paralympic Games that landed him a \\"not great\\" bronze, Cundy joined the high-performance swimming centre at Swansea. Cycling career In 2006, he switched from swimming to cycling, competing at international events in the C4 disability category. Winning gold in the kilo in his debut at the 2006 world championships, he repeated this feat in 2007 and 2009 also taking the team sprint title at both events. Since switching to cycling he has been based in Manchester where he trains with the Great Britain Cycling squad. Representing Great Britain at the 2008 Summer Paralympics in Beijing, Cundy broke the world record on the way to winning the gold in the 1km Time Trial with a time of 1 minute 5.466 seconds. This made him one of only a handful of athletes that have become Paralympic champion in two different sports. Cundy was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2009 New Year Honours. He was selected for the Great Britain team at the 2012 Summer Paralympics. He was expected to win gold in the C4/5 Men's 1 km time trial, but slipped shortly after starting, ostensibly due to the starting gate not working properly, gripping his wheel for too long. The technical delegate of the International Cycling Union, Louis Barbeau, disagreed, refusing him a restart. Cundy then erupted into a rage, swearing and throwing water bottles. He later apologised to the crowd, though made clear that he still disagreed with the decision. He won bronze in the C4/5 men's 4 km pursuit, racing Diego Gomez of Colombia. In the first kilometre of the race, he clocked a time of 1:05.317 in the heats, which would have won the 1 km time trial. He is the fastest solo Paralympian of all time, completing the flying 200m in a time of 10.805 seconds (66.635 km/h).National Track Championships - Day 4 , British Cycling, 1 October 2011 On 12 October 2012, Cundy was awarded an Honorary Doctorate from Anglia Ruskin University with a ceremony at the Cambridge Corn Exchange. Cundy aimed to qualify for the England team for the 2014 Commonwealth Games, however he abandoned this hope after placing fifth among English competitors and eighth overall in the 1km time trial at the 2013 British National Track Championships, despite setting a new personal best and a world record for the C4 category. Subsequently he won gold at the 2014 UCI Para-cycling Track World Championships in Aguascalientes in the C4 1 km time trial, earning his ninth world title and breaking his own world record with a time of 1:01.466. In October 2014, Cundy was admitted to hospital with low blood pressure and cold or flu symptoms. Eventually diagnosed with Epiglottitis, Cundy was placed in an ICU unit and discharged 14 days later. Had he not had been in hospital the doctors believe this infection would have been fatal, he made a fast recovery and raced a few months later at the 2015 Newport Paracycling International where he again went undefeated and set a new PB, against all the odds. More recently in 2015 and 2016 Cundy still remains undefeated in the 1 km TT, making it 10 years unbeaten on the track at the World Track Championships with the only missing medal being that of London 2012 with the controversial DNF. In addition to his 2016 Kilo Gold Medal, Jody Cundy became a double world champion with British Cycling teams mates Louis Rolfe and Jon-Allan Butterworth winning in a new world record time at the World Championships in Montichari, Italy in March. Since then it has now been officially announced that Cundy will be travelling to Rio for his sixth Paralympic Games. Currently sponsors OSSUR are creating a new leg for the 2016 Paralympics and Jody is rumoured to be looking into a new customer design with good humour and replacing his trademark Union Jack prosthetic. At the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio, Cundy regained his Kilo Paralympic title in a new Paralympic record of 1:04.492 which when factored for C4 athletes gave a winning time of 1:02.473 In the final track cycling event of the 2016 Summer Paralympics Jody teamed up with Louis Rolfe and Jon-Allan Butterworth to take the Mixed Team Sprint C1-5 gold medal in a world-record time of 48.635.https://www.rio2016.com/en/paralympics/cycling-track- mixed-c1-5-750m-team-sprint-gold Cundy was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2017 New Year Honours for services to cycling and swimming.

It was officially redesignated in the 65th Army of Don Front, in recognition of that division's leading role in reducing the German 6th Army during Operation Ring, the destruction of the encircled German and Romanian forces at Stalingrad. During the following months it was substantially rebuilt while moving north during the spring of the year. The division put up a very strong defense in the Battle of Kursk, facing some of the main elements of Army Group South, and then attacked through the western Ukraine after the German defeat. Along with the rest of 6th Guards Army it moved further north to join 2nd Baltic and later 1st Baltic Front in the buildup to the summer offensive against Army Group Center, winning a battle honor and shortly after the Order of the Red Banner in the process. During the rest of 1944 it advanced through the Baltic states and ended the war near the Baltic Sea, helping to besiege Army Group Courland in 1945. The 67th Guards was disbanded in 1946.  Formation  The 67th Guards was one of two Guards rifle divisions (the other being the 66th Guards) created prior to the German surrender during the Battle of Stalingrad. When formed, its order of battle was as follows: * 196th Guards Rifle Regiment from 807th Rifle Regiment * 199th Guards Rifle Regiment from 809th Rifle Regiment * 201st Guards Rifle Regiment from 812nd Rifle Regiment * 138th Guards Artillery Regiment from 404th Artillery Regiment * 73rd Guards Antitank Battalion from 336th Antitank BattalionCharles C.

Serafim Pavlovich Merkulov, who had commanded the 304th prior to its redesignation, remained in command and was promoted to the rank of major general on January 27. Operation Ring The final stage of Operation Ring was scheduled to begin on January 22, but in the event began in earnest the day before with a strong reconnaissance-in-force by elements of the 24th, 65th and 21st Armies against the entire northwestern corner of 6th Army's defenses beginning just before 1000 hours. During the day this attack shattered the defenses of the VIII Army Corps' 113th, 76th and 44th Infantry Divisions in the 10 km-wide sector from just south of Novaya Nadezhda State Farm southward to Hill 134.4. The 76th was seriously damaged and Army Group Don reported in the evening that \\"the 44th ID seems to be crushed.\\" Furthermore a gap 6 km wide had been carved into 6th Army's western front with no hope of being closed and Gumrak airfield was now within range of Soviet medium artillery. These successes were enough to secure Guards status for the 293rd and 304th Rifle Divisions by the end of the day.David M. Glantz, Endgame at Stalingrad, Book Two, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2014, pp. 506-09 During January 25 the 65th Army pressed forward with the 27th and 67th Guards, 23rd and 233rd Rifle Divisions, converging on Aleksandrova and the western half of Gorodishche, capturing both towns as well as Razgulaevka Station. As they advanced these divisions pushed the 76th and 113rd Infantry back toward the Vishnevaia Balka and the western end of the Barrikady workers' settlement. The 67th Guards, 233rd and 24th Rifle Divisions then oriented their assault to the western edge of the Krasny Oktyabr village with the goal of linking up with the left wing of 62nd Army, specifically the 13th Guards and 284th Rifle Divisions. This was intended to chop 6th Army's pocket in two and succeeded just after dawn on January 26, catching the German defenders disorganized and demoralized by the previous day's combat. During the day the 67th Guards, with the 24th and 233rd, faced tough fighting against the remnants of the 76th Infantry, advancing 3‚Äì5 km. The division made the best progress, reaching and capturing Marker 73.6, less than 1000m from the western edge of the two factory villages.Glantz, Endgame at Stalingrad, Book Two, pp. 525-26, 530, 536 The southern German pocket, including Field Marshal F. Paulus, surrendered on January 31. The next day Don Front concentrated its artillery and airpower, along with the 62nd, 65th and 66th Armies against the roughly 50,000 men remaining in the northern pocket. The attack began at 0830 hours with a 90-minute artillery preparation with about 1,000 guns directly supporting 65th Army. The division gave support to the main attack by the 23rd and 24th Divisions across the Vishnevaia Balka which soon gained anywhere from 600-1,200m and resulted in the capture of up to 20,000 German soldiers and the through demoralization of the remainder. All but a few holdouts surrendered on February 2, and the 67th Guards and 214th Rifle Divisions drew the duty of clearing these from the factory district:Within days the division was transferred to 21st Army along with the 23rd Division, which became the 71st Guards Rifle Division on March 1.Glantz, Endgame at Stalingrad, Book Two, pp. 564-67, 575 By the beginning of March, Don Front had become Central Front and at about the same time the 21st Army was re-designated as 6th Guards Army, joining Voronezh Front later that month. Along with nearly all of the Stalingrad divisions, the 67th Guards required extensive rebuilding during these months. During April it was assigned to 22nd Guards Rifle Corps and 6th Guards Army moved inside the Kursk salient, helping to fortify the south face of the bulge.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1943, pp. 63, 87, 111Sharp, \\"Red Guards\\", p. 72 On June 23 General Merkulov handed his command over to Col. Aleksei Ivanovich Baksov, who would be promoted to major general on June 3, 1944.http://www.generals.dk states that Merkulov left command of the division on February 2: http://generals.dk/general/Merkulov/Serafim_Petrovich/Soviet_Union.html. Zamulin gives the date of Baksov's command as June 30; Zamulin, The Battle of Kursk - Controversial and Neglected Aspects, p. 231  Battle of Kursk  As of July 1 the 22nd Guards Corps had the 67th and 71st Guards deployed in the first echelon and the 90th Guards Rifle Division in second echelon. The boundary between the 67th and 71st was secured with assets of the latter including a battery of its 151st Guards Artillery Regiment, a battery of regimental guns, two batteries of 82mm mortars, 11 antitank guns, 14 antitank rifles, three heavy and nine light machine guns. The 67th Guards disposed of somewhat fewer weapons. These were located southwest and south of the village of Cherkasskoe which was roughly the boundary between the divisions although held by the 67th. A minefield and an antitank ditch barred the approaches to its forward edge.Soviet General Staff, The Battle of Kursk, ed. & trans. R. W. Harrison, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2016, Kindle ed., Book 1, ch. 1, 2 As a further part of the plan of defense Voronezh Front was committed to a counter-artillery preparation at such time it became clear that the German attack was imminent. The 67th Guards was to employ its 138th Guards Artillery Regiment, its regimental guns, and its 82mm and 120mm mortars on the approaches to Cherkasskoe. In the event this plan was preempted by forward detachments of 4th Panzer Army which attacked at 1610 hours on July 4, following bombing attacks and a 10-minute artillery preparation, with the goals of destroying the division's security outposts and seizing high ground for observation, but made only limited progress.Valeriy Zamulin, The Battle of Kursk - Controversial and Neglected Aspects, ed. & trans. S. Britton, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2017, pp. 207, 210 German plan of attack, showing position of 6th Guards Army.Both divisions were struck at 0600 hours on the opening day of the German offensive by XXXXVIII Panzer Corps. This powerful formation included the 11th Panzer Division, Gro√üdeutschland Panzer-Grenadier Division and the 10th Panzer Brigade, which was equipped with the first Panther tanks to enter service. The main German thrust came from the Gertsovka to Butovo area toward Korovino and Cherkasskoe with the 67th Guards facing an infantry regiment reinforced by 70 tanks and supported by 70 aircraft; this first effort was beaten off. Even before the attack began the German forces encountered serious problems due to minefields and other Soviet fixed defenses, as well as overcrowding on a very narrow attack sector. The Panthers became stuck in the minefields, blocking the tanks of Gro√üdeutschland and forcing the infantry to go in without direct armor support. A marshy gully in front of the 196th Guards Rifle Regiment, which had been skilfully strengthened with a system of anti-tank obstacles, proved to be a difficult and time-consuming barrier. A second attack followed at 0710, this time with two infantry regiments and up to 100 tanks. Thanks to artillery fire from an antitank strongpoint which had been prepared near Cherkasskoe, as well as divisional and army artillery, this attack was also beaten back to its start line. Further attacks followed at 0800 and 1030 with no better results. Soviet observers recorded 25 tanks and up to 300 infantrymen blown up on the minefields in front of the village. By late in the morning the 27th Antitank Brigade arrived from 6th Guards Army reserve to help secure the boundary between the two Guards divisions.Zamulin, Demolishing the Myth, ed. & trans. S. Britton, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2011, p. 103Soviet General Staff, The Battle of Kursk, Kindle ed., Book 1, ch. 3 As the day wore on elements of the 3rd Panzer Division and Gro√üdeutschland struck at the boundary between the two divisions, attempting to overrun the village strongpoints and also to outflank Cherkasskoe from the east. Successive bombing attacks cleared a path for their tanks and the infantry following; the armor advanced at low speed (no more than 5‚Äì10 km/h) with frequent stops while waiting for the infantry to come up. At noon an infantry regiment supported by 30 tanks attacked from Butovo toward heights 244.5 and 237.8, finally penetrating into the 67th Guards' defense. Despite this partial success the panzers became stuck between the two villages for the rest of the day, in heavy fighting, only establishing a tenuous hold on part of Cherkasskoe by midnight, a very poor showing for what was planned to be a major breakthrough of the Soviet defenses. The Soviet engineering technical service (TOS) had played an important role in assisting the defense, accounting for up to 200 German infantry and five tanks using delayed-action mines and booby traps near height 244.5 and on the approaches to Cherkasskoe.Zamulin, Demolishing the Myth, pp. 103-04Soviet General Staff, The Battle of Kursk, Kindle ed., Book 1, ch. 3 During this fighting a battalion of the 196th Guards Regiment defending an antitank strongpoint was ordered by Colonel Baksov to fall back to an alternate defensive line to the north. A platoon under command of Jr. Lt. Alekov was tasked with covering the battalion's withdrawal; Alekov reportedly motivated his 15 men with the shout, \\"The Guard may die, but does not retreat!\\" Covered by the fire of this platoon the battalion was able to fall back in an organized fashion and halt any further German advance, although Alekov and all members of his platoon were killed. By day's end the day the two divisions occupied a line from Bubny to Nova-Ivanovka to Yarki to Trirechnoe.Soviet General Staff, The Battle of Kursk, Kindle ed., Book 1, ch. 3. This source does not state who recorded Alekov's words. Soviet machine gun crew during the Battle of Kursk.On July 6 the 67th Guards Rifle continued in savage combat with the XXXXVIII Panzer Corps. The German attack began at 1000 hours with an artillery and air preparation; the plan was to launch two concentric attacks along the Oboyan axis with one, involving the 11th Panzer, Gro√üdeutschland, and the 332nd Infantry Division, to encircle Cherkasskoe before pressing on toward Pokrovka.Soviet General Staff, The Battle of Kursk, Kindle ed., Book 1, ch. 3. Masses of heavy armor, including Tiger tanks, pushed against the division's positions without making a breakthrough. For its part, the division employed tank-hunting dogs very successfully:When German armor arrived at Dmitrievka the combat became very intense as individual antitank men, armed with Molotov cocktails and grenades, were sent forth to repulse the attack. The chief of the 199th Guards Regiment's chemical service, Cpt. Batanov, led his group of tank destroyers until the panzers advanced within 15-20m, at which point their projectiles halted or destroyed up to 12 tanks.Soviet General Staff, The Battle of Kursk, Kindle ed., Book 1, ch. 3. In spite of these successes, the division's line was overrun by Gro√üdeutschland and the 11th Panzer Division, and 6th Guards Army ordered the division to fall back to a further line in the Syrtsevo to Dubrova area. The situation was made worse by lack of cooperation and communications between 22nd Guards Corps and the 1st Tank Army, which was intended to be a backstop to 6th Guards.Zamulin, The Battle of Kursk - Controversial and Neglected Aspects, p. 238 By nightfall the division was partly encircled and had to slip out through German lines, with substantial losses. On the morning of July 7 it was moved into the Army reserve along with the 51st and 52nd Guards Rifle Divisions of the neighboring 23rd Guards Rifle Corps where it began putting itself in order in the Berezovka area. Overnight the division occupied defensive positions along the line of the southern outskirts of Verkhopene to Shchenyachii woods to Stanovaya woods. The following day the 67th and 51st Guards cooperated with elements of the 3rd Mechanized and 6th Tank Corps in blocking any German advance along the direct paved road to Oboyan. In order to create more favorable conditions for a renewed attack on July 9 a German infantry regiment supported by 60 tanks attacked the division at 0200 hours along the southern outskirts of the strongpoint of Verkhopene and pushed them back to the north. The main assault unfolded at 0900 following a massive airstrike. On the Verkhopene to Stanovaya woods sector up to 200 panzers struck units of the 3rd Mechanized and 67th Guards defending the southern slopes of height 242, 3.5 km east of the village. The first attack was beaten off by the fire of antitank artillery and dug-in tanks with significant losses and a further attempt at 1130 hours fared similarly. The German forces now undertook to outflank Verkhopene to the east, heading for Kalinovka; at the same time German infantry renewed the attack from the village's southern outskirts and, following fierce street fighting, reached the northeastern outskirts. By 1300 the division had fallen back to a line from the southern outskirts of Kalinovka to height 251.4 and by day's end had suffered considerable casualties and had retreated farther north to the Kalinovka to Vladimirovka area to regroup. The German breakthrough attempt in the area had been stymied by the combined Soviet forces, including the 309th Rifle Division which was now covering the 67th Guards and 3rd Mechanized.Soviet General Staff, The Battle of Kursk, Kindle ed., Book 1, ch. 3. Throughout July 10 the XXXXVIII Panzer Corps continued to attack the division and the 10th Tank and 3rd Mechanized Corps, attempting to advance west of the Oboyan road with up to 100 tanks, but by the onset of darkness the defenders continued to hold their positions. Overnight these were reinforced by elements of the 40th Army. At about this time the division was reassigned to the 23rd Guards Rifle Corps, which also contained the 309th and 204th Rifle Divisions. Overnight on July 10/11 Voronezh Front made plans to go over to the counteroffensive with the 23rd Guards Corps attacking from the line of Kalinovka to height 244.8 in the general direction of Krasnaya Dubrava and Pokrovka on the morning of July 12. At 0400 hours the Corps occupied its jumping-off positions. While the major tank battle at Prokhorovka took place the Corps, along with units of the 3rd Mechanized and 31st Tank Corps, attacked from 0830 until 1700 hours; the 204th and 309th Divisions gained some ground but the 67th Guards did not. Further efforts on July 14 made no progress and on the morning of the 15th the 6th Guards Army went over to the defense. The 67th division played little role in the rest of the battle, and once again had to be substantially rebuilt.Zamulin, Demolishing the Myth, pp. 123, 427Soviet General Staff, The Battle of Kursk, Kindle ed., Book 1, ch. 3. By the beginning of August it had returned to 22nd Guards Corps with the 71st and 90th Guards.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1943, p. 193 Belgorod-Kharkov Offensive On July 24 the STAVKA announced on Moscow radio that the German forces had been forced back to their lines of July 5. While the Belgorod-Kharkov Offensive did not officially start until August 3, in fact fighting continued through these ten days. The new offensive was led by 5th Guards Army with 6th Guards, three other field armies and two tank armies in support. Belgorod was liberated on August 5. Two days later the offensive began to focus in the area of Bogodukhov and 6th Guards was brought up to reinforce 1st Tank Army. By August 11 the Army was advancing on Poltava and in a directive from the Front commander on the afternoon of August 13 the 67th and 71st Guards were ordered to reach a line from Berezovka to Kolomak and secure it to prevent any German breakthrough along this sector. However a counterthrust on August 15 by 3rd SS Panzergrenadier Division Totenkopf flanked the Army and drove it off to the north, reaching the line of the Merla River. The German forces went over to the defense on this axis on August 17.Roman T√∂ppel, Kursk 1943: The Greatest Battle of the Second World War, Helion & Co., Ltd., Warwick, UK, 2018, Kindle ed., ch. 2, sect.

It went over to the attack in the narrow sector between Lake Bolshoi Ivan and Lake Nevel against German defenses at Karataia manned by the 56th and 69th Infantry Divisions of 16th Army's I Army Corps. 22nd Guards Corps was deployed on the right with the 67th Guards in second echelon. The assault was supported by two tank brigades but made only painful progress, as indicated in the history of the 71st Guards:The Army went over to the defense on November 15. By the end of the month the 67th and 71st Guards were reassigned to the 96th Rifle Corps, still in 6th Guards Army.Glantz, Battle for Belorussia, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2016, pp. 148-51 On December 8 the German 122nd Infantry Division punched a small penetration through the defenses of the 71st Guards which required intervention by the 23rd Guards Corps. This helped convince the Soviet command to finally eliminate the German salient from Novosokolniki south nearly to Nevel. In late December the Front began a new offensive in the direction of Idritsa and Pustoshka, while 1st Baltic Front continued attacking south towards Vitebsk. 2nd Baltic was caught off-guard when 16th Army began evacuating the salient on December 29. The 67th Guards was now in the 97th Rifle Corps directly north of Nevel and took part in the pursuit of the retreating German forces, along with the 51st and 71st Guards and backed by two tank brigades and a regiment. While the history of 6th Guards Army states that I Army Corps was driven back in heavy fighting it appears from German records and Soviet casualty figures that most of the combat occurred when the new German defense line at the base of the salient was reached on January 6, 1944. Within a month the Red Army offensives at Leningrad and Novgorod forced 16th Army to wheel its defenses westward to near Pskov.Glantz, Battle for Belorussia, pp. 235-39, 304-06, 691 Operation Bagration During January the division was transferred to the 12th Guards Rifle Corps before returning to the 23rd Guards Corps in February when the 6th Guards Army was transferred to the 1st Baltic Front.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1944, pp. 38, 68 The division would remain in this Corps for the duration of the war. Vitebsk-Orsha Offensive.In the planning for Operation Bagration, the Corps was given an assault role, compressed into a front of just 10 km, working with the two assault corps of the adjacent 43rd Army. 6th Guards Army had been moved in secrecy into the line north of the German-held Vitebsk salient over three nights previous to the attack.Walter S. Dunn, Jr. Soviet Blitzkrieg, Stackpole Books, Mechanicsburg, US, 2008, pp. 97-98 It deployed the 22nd and 23rd Guards Corps in the first echelon with the 103rd and 2nd Guards Rifle Corps in the second. The 23rd Guards was to break through the German defense between Byvalino and Novaya Igumenshchina and then drive headlong in the direction of Dobrino, cut the rail line and highway between Vitebsk and Polotsk, and capture a line from Verbali to Gubitsa. Subsequently it was to attack toward Zheludova and Pyatigorsk and clear a passage for the commitment of the 1st Tank Corps.Soviet General Staff, Operation Bagration, ed. & trans. R. W. Harrison, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2016, Kindle ed., vol. 1, ch. 3 The Soviet assault on June 22 began at dawn with a very heavy artillery barrage against the positions of the German 252nd Infantry Division and Corps Detachment D. By noon the assault battalions of the division had broken through the second German defense line and reached the Obol River. The following armored group crossed the river and advanced a total of 7 km by evening. On the second day an additional advance of 16 km was made, and during the following night Corps Detachment D collapsed. By the evening of the 24th, the division crossed the Dvina River north of Beshenkovichi and held a 50 km front along the river; the gap between 6th Guards Army attacking from the north and 39th Army from the south was narrowed to just 10 km. On the 25th the other two divisions of 23rd Guards Rifle Corps used the 67th Guards Rifle's bridgehead to develop the offensive westward, and late that day, farther to the east, the pincers closed on the Vitebsk salient, trapping what remained of five German divisions.Dunn, Jr., Soviet Blitzkrieg, pp. 95-98, 102-07 In recognition of its achievements in this offensive, the 67th Guards was awarded its honorific: On July 22 the commander of the 201st Guards Rifle Regiment, Lt. Col. Georgi Aleksandrovich Inozemtsev, was named as a Hero of the Soviet Union. Born at Bataysk he had been a historian and civil servant, as well as a Red Army reservist, before the war. He took command of the Regiment on September 16, 1943 after having served as the chief of staff of the 199th Guards Regiment at Kursk. Conducting a reconnaissance-in-force on the evening of June 22 he led the Regiment into the German defense line and captured the village of Ratkovo. The next day the Regiment cut the Vitebsk - Polotsk railway line and crossed the Dvina River, during which Inozemtsev was wounded, but did not leave his command. After fighting off several German counterattacks the 201st secured the crossing of the rest of the 67th Guards. During the day the Regiment claimed over 700 enemy soldiers and officers killed or wounded, and captured 37 prisoners. Inozemtsev went on to command the 71st Guards Division in early 1945 and published a number of articles and books on the history and prehistory of the Rostov region before his death in 1957.http://www.warheroes.ru/hero/hero.asp?Hero_id=10638.

Baltic Offensives The destruction of German LIII Army Corps at Vitebsk helped to open a large gap between their Army Groups Center and North. By June 26 the 67th Guards was located near Obol, north of the Dvina and about 35 km southeast of Polotsk.The Gamers, Inc., Baltic Gap, Multi-Man Publishing, Inc., Millersville, MD, 2009, p. 9 On June 30 the 23rd Guards Corps, led by 1st Tank Corps, was ordered into the gap, bypassing south of the remaining German positions at Polotsk. That city was liberated on July 4 and on July 23 the division would be awarded the Order of the Red Banner for its part in this victory. By the beginning of August the 6th Guards Army had advanced deep into the \\"Baltic Gap\\" and had crossed the border into Lithuania and the division had reached the area of Roki≈°kis.The Gamers, Inc., Baltic Gap, p. 22 On August 8 General Baksov was given command of the 2nd Guards Rifle Corps and was replaced in command of the division by Maj. Gen. Yakov Filippovich Eremenko; Baksov would go on to be promoted to the rank of colonel general in 1963. At the start of the German Operation Doppelkopf in mid-August the division was located north of Bir≈æai and after helping to fight off the counteroffensive advanced on ≈†iauliai.The Gamers, Inc., Baltic Gap, pp. 27, 28 On October 31 all three rifle regiments of the division would be decorated for their roles in the fighting for this city, with the 196th winning the Order of the Red Banner, the 199th receiving the Order of Suvorov, 3rd Degree, and the 201st being presented the Order of Kutuzov, 3rd Degree. Over the following months the 1st Baltic Front pushed through to the Baltic coast, and what remained of Army Group North was confined to the Courland Pocket. On January 12, 1945 General Eremenko was succeeded in command by Hero of the Soviet Union Col. Lev Illarionovich Puzanov, but this officer was in turn replaced a week later by Col. Mikhail Petrovich Pugaev, who would remain in command for the duration. The division remained in this region for the duration as part of the confining forces; in April, 1945, it was reassigned, along with the rest of its corps, to 67th Army.Sharp, \\"Red Guards\\", p. 72  Postwar  At the war's end the division's men and women shared the full title of 67th Guards Rifle, Vitebsk, Order of the Red Banner Division.

Pilot-in-command is LT Leo S. Rolek, co-pilot is LTJG Charles D. Neville. Twenty minutes later, the crew reports their position and commences operations with four approaches to sonar hover and four night/low visibility and wind-line rescue patterns with hover trim practice until dusk. After sunset (1953 hours), the crew conducts four more approaches to sonar hovers while practising dip-to-dip navigation with the pilots alternating approaches. Complying with reporting in every half-hour, the practices proceed normally until 2133. With the sonar dome lowered down to 100 feet below the water's surface, the hover of the helicopter becomes unstable. The two sonar operators, AWH3 Brady W. Turner and AWH3 Peter C. Cassidy, sink the sonar dome deeper in the ocean, hoping the stability will improve and, for a brief moment, it works. But, then the sonar dome begins to pull Helo '740' downward to 30 feet above the waterline. The helicopter, pulled backwards, impacts the water, sinks quickly. The four crewmen all egress and are picked up by a Coast Guard Sikorsky HH-3F Pelican shortly before midnight and transported to the Naval Hospital at San Diego. Three crewmen are released from the hospital in the days that follow, but the pilot, who suffered a ruptured spleen, dies in hospital over three weeks later.

The accident investigation determined that a lightning strike caused an explosion in a fuel tank in the wing, leading to flutter and the separation of the wing.Page describing the crash of IIAF 5-8104 retrieved 2008-01-13. ;June:The first prototype of the Bell YAH-63, 73-22246, first flown on 1 October 1975, crashed in 1976, but a static test prototype was brought up to flight standard and, along with the second prototype, 73-22247, entered the flyoff against the Hughes entry, the Model 77, YAH-64. The U.S. Army ultimately selected the AH-64 over the Bell entry, naming it the Apache. ;9 August:Sikorsky YUH-60A UTTAS, 73-21650, first prototype to fly, fully loaded with 14 Army personnel during testing, makes emergency landing at 2315 hrs. in a wooded area of Fort Campbell, Kentucky, due to vibration caused by outer skin of a main rotor blade coming loose. Due to heavy mist, pilot CW2 Charlie Lovell believes he is landing in a cornfield but instead comes down in a pine forest. Main rotor scythes down 40 pines, some as large as five inches in diameter, as it lands, but main rotor blades do not shatter. Only injury is to a soldier who bumps his head against a truncated pine as he egresses the helicopter. After cutting down stumps around the aircraft, and replacing the main and tail rotors, the now-nicknamed \\"Phoenix\\" is flown out of the site three days later. US Army, duly impressed by the crash survivability shown, will award the UTTAS contract to Sikorsky and the design will be named the Blackhawk.Leoni, Ray D., \\"Black Hawk: The Story of a World Class Helicopter\\", American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc., Reston, Virginia, 2007, , pages 171‚Äì176. This airframe will be destroyed in a crash on 19 May 1978. ;3 September:A Lockheed C-130H Hercules, 7772, \\"24 de Julio\\", belonging to the Venezuelan Air Force crashed in the Azores Islands, near the Lajes Field at ~2145 hrs., while attempting an approach in a storm (Hurricane Emmy). 64 passengers, including most of the University Choir of the Venezuelan Central University (Universidad Central de Venezuela) and its Director Mr. Vinicio Adames, together with 4 crewmembers died in the accident. ;6 September : Lt. Viktor Ivanovich Belenko, of the 513th Fighter Regiment, 11th Air Army, based at Chuguyevka, Primorsky Krai, Soviet Union, defects to Japan in a nearly new MiG-25P Foxbat, USSR Product #84, Bort 'Red 31', landing at Hakodate Airport. Despite deploying two drag chutes, the heavy interceptor overruns the mile-long runway, knocks over two small antennae, and damages the nose landing gear. The pilot is granted asylum by the United States and the aircraft is eventually returned to the Soviet Union ‚Äì after it has been dismantled and examined by Western experts, an intelligence windfall of the highest order. ;14 September: While the USS John F. Kennedy is operating ~100 miles NW of Scapa Flow, Scotland, as part of a 100 ship NATO naval exercise, Teamwork 76, Press Day is marred by the loss of Grumman F-14A Tomcat, BuNo 159588, 'AB 221', of VF-32, over the side into the North Sea when its engines go inexplicably to full power while the fighter is being prepped for catapult 3. Steered to port away from other aircraft by the pilot as the locked brakes fail to keep the jet in place, the Tomcat's starboard wing strikes two other aircraft and as it tips off of the flight deck, pilot Lt. J. L. Kosich, and his radar intercept officer, Lt. (jg) L. E. Seymour, eject. A Soviet cruiser shadowing the manoeuvers notes the loss of the Tomcat and its state-of-the-art Phoenix missile and AN/AWG-9 fire control radar, so the U.S. Navy is forced into an immediate recovery effort that takes eight weeks. The nuclear research submarine NR-1 eventually retrieves the missile from a depth of 1,650 feet, and two leased heavy trawlers snag and drag the Tomcat to shallower water where the heavily damaged airframe is salvaged and found to have all its sub- systems intact. ;26 September:A USAF Boeing KC-135A Stratotanker, 61-0296, c/n 18203, of the 46th Air Refueling Squadron, Strategic Air Command, on a routine tanker training mission en route from K.I.

A second aircrewman is lost with the aircraft. ;21 December:Imperial Iranian Air Force Lockheed C-130H Hercules 5-8536 crashed during approach in bad weather to Shiraz, Iran. 1977 ;17 January:Avro Vulcan B.2, XM600, of 101 Squadron, crashes at Spilsby, Lincs. after the five crew abandon the aircraft due to a fire which started in the port wing during a RAT (Ram Air Turbine) deployment from high altitude. The RAT overvaulted and its power arced to a high pressure fuel line to the #1 engine. The fuel line ruptured between the pressure sensor for the engine and the high-pressure fuel pump causing an open circuit. The pump attempted to increase the pressure at the engine by going to full speed which resulted in a high pressure fuel-fed fire. This fire quickly spread to the #2 engine, also on the port side, and then, more slowly, into the bomb-bay area on the port side of the aircraft. The heat of the fire in the bomb bay caused the flight control rods located on the port side of the bomb bay to expand which caused erroneous flight commands to the major flight controls which in turn resulted in the pilots losing control of the aircraft and the eventual order to abandon aircraft. Crew member account. ;20 January:A USCG Sikorsky HH-52A Seaguard, 1448, strikes three electrical transmission wires and crashes into the ice-filled Illinois River. The crew had been performing an aerial ice patrol along the Illinois and Mississippi Rivers.

Both crew members eject seconds before impact; one fatality, no civilian deaths.¬∞ ;26 April :Lockheed P-3 Orion, BuNo 152724, 'LJ-04', of VP-23, crashed at sea on landing approach to Lajes, killing seven. Cause of the accident was undetermined due to inability to recover aircraft remains from the extreme depths.http://vp23.org/Squadron- History/ ;4 May :First prototype Lockheed Have Blue stealth test bed, c/n 1001, on its 37th flight, hit the runway a little too hard at Groom Lake, Nevada, and had to lift off for another pass rather than go into a skid, but had bent the right main gear strut. The landing gear had been retracted after the \\"touch and go\\", and now the right main gear leg wouldn't extend. Despite many attempts, there was no way to get the gear down. Critically low on fuel, Lockheed test pilot Bill Park decided to eject and let the aircraft crash into the desert. Park suffered a serious back injury and concussion, ending his career as a test pilot. The airframe was bulldozed under the desert. News of the crash leaked to the press, and some vague comments were made about the possible existence of \\"stealth\\" aircraft. ;19 May:First prototype Sikorsky YUH-60A Black Hawk, 73-21650, crashes during testing at the Sikorsky plant, Stratford, Connecticut, killing three company personnel. Army investigation reveals that during routine maintenance the night before the fatal flight, the airspeed sensor for the tailplane actuating system was inadvertently left unconnected. As the aircraft transitioned from hover to forward flight, the tailplane did not automatically change its angle and as speed built up, it forced the helicopter's nose down until an attitude was reached from which recovery was impossible. A manual back-up system was available and functioning, and could have been used to correct the tailplane angle, but for unexplained reasons it was not used, possibly due to failure to analyze the nature of the problem in time. Minor modifications are introduced as a result of this accident. ;29 May:A USAF Convair F-106A Delta Dart, 59-0144 lost power on takeoff at McChord AFB, Wa. The pilot ejected safely. The jet spun out of control and flipped upside down landing in a pond inside an apartment complex.

About 130 miles out, the right engine's oil pressure dropped, and the pilots shut the engine down and turned back to Guam. Prior to takeoff they had not factored in heat and humidity to the airplane performance, and so were now too heavy to maintain altitude on one engine. In trying to maintain altitude, they slowed to 100 MPH, which made them sink even faster. They ditched 8 miles from the southern tip of Guam. The pilot failed to use flaps to lower his speed during landing, and landed with a 15 MPH tailwind, contributing to a hard landing, the aircraft nose tearing off, and two fatalities. ;22 September:A U.S. Navy Lockheed P-3B Orion, BuNo 152757 of VP-8 on flight out of Naval Air Station Brunswick, Maine, at 1205 hrs. en route to Trenton, Ontario for display at an air show, explodes in the air eight-ten minutes later and comes down over Poland, Maine. Cause is thought to be failure of number one (port outer) engine nacelle due to \\"whirl-mode\\" in turbulence; engine separates along with 11 feet of outer port wing, strikes and shears off the port horizontal stabilizer. Aerodynamic forces then cause loss of other three engines, starboard wing fails at fuselage, which rolls inverted and impacts ground. Much of the debris comes down near the intersection of Route 11 and Megquier Hill Road, but pieces are scattered in a wide area around the site. No homes are hit, but the nearest residences to the wreckage are only a few hundred feet away. The blast blows out some of the windows in a nearby house.

Two University of Arizona students, Leticia Felix Humphrey, 21, a business education major, and her sister, Clarissa Felix, 20, majoring in early education, were driving down Highland in Leticia's car when the plane hit and engulfed it in flames. Leticia died there at the scene of the crash and Clarissa died shortly after. At least five other civilians were less seriously injured. The pilot, Capt.

Both crews escape in each plane's two-seat crew ejection modules. Flotation bags on the Peluso/Schlitt module became partially dislodged soon after landing and the module submerged under several feet of water. The other crew module became inverted immediately after hitting the water and remained inverted on the water's surface until the arrival of a fishing vessel. At that time the crew activated self-righting bags that partially righted the module. The crew then exited the module and, assisted by a RAF rescue parajumper, climbed aboard the fishing vessel before being hoisted to a RAF rescue helicopter.

Life Baptista Malatesta was the daughter of Antonio II da Montefeltro, Count of Urbino, and the granddaughter of Federico II da Montefeltro. On 14 June 1405 she married Galeazzo Malatesta, the heir to the lordship of Pesaro. Galeazzo came to power in 1429 but was so hated as a ruler that, after two years of power in 1431, he was driven from his city. His wife then returned to her old home at Urbino. She lived for some twenty years a widowed and secluded life. She died, as a Sister of the Franciscan Order of Santa Chiara, in 1448. De studiis et litteris She was a learned woman of the aristocracy who was educated in philosophy and languages, and was a poet and orator. She corresponded with other scholars of her time such as Leonardo Bruni. Bruni's letter to Baptista Malatesta of Montefeltro, entitled De studiis et litteris, was written in 1424. In it, Bruni describes a course of study suitable for women, illustrating the belief, early on held by humanists, that classical studies are \\"worthy to be pursued by men and women alike.\\" De studiis et litteris is the earliest known example of a humanist inter-gender dialogue about women's education. The Emperor Sigismund, when passing through Urbino in 1433, was greeted by her in a Latin oration, which half a century later was still thought worthy of print.

The film was a blockbuster hit at the box office. The movie is heavily inspired by the Hindi film Andaz Apna Apna and partially by the Tamil movie Sabaash Meena. It was remade in Telugu as Veedevadandi Babu and in Kannada as Galate Aliyandru. Plot Raja is the only son of retired military officer Col. Chandrasekhar, who, even though being very rich, raises his son very strictly. Chandrasekhar decides to get Raja married to his long time friend Viswanathan's daughter Indhu. Vishwanathan is one of the richest men in Ooty and is a tea estate owner. Raja misunderstands another girl as Indhu (Chandrasekhar's nephew Shankar interchanged Indhu's photo with another girl) and decides to run away from house to escape from the wedding. Unknown to Chandrasekhar, Shankar plans to grab Chandrasekhar's properties by triggering Raja to leave the house. Raja runs away and reaches Ooty, where he meets con artist Vasu, and despite initial setbacks both become friends. One day, Raja sees Indhu in Ooty and gets attracted towards her, not knowing that she was the girl fixed for him by his father. Raja follows Indhu and finds her home. Later Raja secures a driver job in Viswanathan's home to woo Indhu. Raja gives his family ring to Vasu to prevent him from disclosing the truth to Viswanathan, but Viswanathan misunderstands that Vasu is Chandrasekhar's son as he wears the ring now. Viswanathan brings Vasu to his home and introduces him as Indhu's fianc√©. One day, a gang tries to attack Vasu, but he is saved by Raja, which makes him understand that there is someone looking out to kill him, so Raja decides to remain in the identity of a driver to unearth the reason behind the goons trying to attack him. Viswanathan informs Chandrasekhar that his son is found but asks him not to come immediately to see him as he does not like his father. Meanwhile, at Ooty, Raja tries to impress Indhu, while Vasu is attracted towards Viswanathan's personal secretary Meena. Slowly love blossoms between Indhu and Raja. Suddenly, Chandrseakhar comes to Ooty to Viswanathan's home to meet Raja. Now, a problem erupts as Raja is in the disguise of a driver. Both Raja and Vasu try to manage by roaming together for a few days so that they can convince both Viswanathan and Chandrasekhar. Meanwhile, Shankar gets furious upon knowing that Raja is found. He befriends Kasinathan, who is Viswanathan's twin brother. However, Kasinathan is a criminal who has just been released from jail. They kidnap Viswanathan, and now, Kasinathan comes to Viswanathan's place so that he can enjoy all the properties and wealth. Doubt erupts for Raja and Vasu upon seeing Kasinathan as he spends money lavishly, compared to Viswanathan, who is very stingy. Raja and Vasu secretly follow Kasinathan and finds the whereabouts of Viswanathan and the plan behind his kidnap. Raja is shocked to see his cousin Shankar there as he is the master brain behind all the events. A hilarious fight follows, where in the end, Shankar and Kasinathan get arrested. It is also revealed that Raja is the son of Chandrasekhar. Raja unites with Indhu, while Vasu unites with Meena.

For the filming of the song \\"Azhagiya Laila\\", Rambha wore different dresses for almost every scene, in addition to wigs.  Soundtrack  The music was composed by Sirpy and lyrics were written by Pazhani Bharathi.

Release The film which was released alongside another Karthik starrer Kizhakku Mugam (1996) and ullathai allitha was a success at box-office. Balaji wrote:\\" It stands out in that every aspect of it, be it the romance or the fights, has been handled with an eye on comedy and there is not a single moment of emotions or sentiments\\".http://www.bbthots.com/reviews/rewind/uathaa.html Legacy The success of the film paved way for numerous comedy films. The film made Sundar C. as one of the most sought directors. Rambha gained popularity through this film and became one of the leading heroines. The film also made Manivannan as one of the famous comedians. Karthik and Goundamani became one of the famous comic pairs from the film, the pair went on to do many films. The success of the film led Sundar C. to collaborate with Karthik in subsequent projects - Mettukudi (1996), Unakkaga Ellam Unakkaga (1999) and Azhagana Naatkal (2001). Azhagana Naatkal was compared by critics with Ullathai Allitha due to its similarity in sequences and characterisations. Sundar C. himself listed it as one of the favourite films he had directed. Vimal who acted in director's Kalakalappu (2012) recalled that he had watched this film during his schooldays.http://lite.epaper.timesofindia.com/mobile.aspx?article=yes&pageid;=21&sectid;=edid=&edlabel;=TOICH&mydateHid;=08-05-2012&pubname;=&edname;=&articleid;=Ar02102&publabel;=TOI Subha J.

Club career Morgan joined Swansea in 1905, but found it difficult to break into the side as his favourite position of wing-forward was taken by Swansea stalwarts Scrine and Hayward. Fortunately for Morgan, he was an all-round forward and gained positional play off the wing. Playing alongside one of rugby's true innovators, Dicky Owen, Morgan adapted a new style of wing play. Normally Owen would play in partnership with Dick Jones, but during this period Jones was suffering a long term injury and Morgan developed a natural understanding of Owen's play, and through this became a prolific try scorer. In 1905, Morgan was chosen to play in the Newport team against the touring New Zealand All Blacks. The game that made Morgan as an international player was his club performance in 1908, when he was at the centre of excellent play against the Australians, in which Swansea won 6-0. In the 1908/09 season, Morgan scored 18 tries for Swansea, this record would last for 77 years. International career In 1908, Morgan was chosen to play for Wales against a touring Australian team. Morgan was an unpopular choice, but Cardiff's Billy Neill had switched to the professional league game and left a position to fill. In a tough game, Wales won 9-6 in which Morgan played well. He was selected for the next year's Home Nations Championship, and in a team that contained not only Owen, but also Jack Bancroft and Billy Trew, Wales beat England 8-0. In the next year's tournament, Morgan played all three games, including the newly introduced French team, against whom Morgan scored two tries. Morgan would play 13 matches in total for Wales, scoring a total of six tries, and lifting the Triple Crown in 1911. Due to strategic formation changes by the Welsh selectors, Morgan was dropped in 1912 and was sorely missed in the game against England when Wales were beaten fairly easily.Thomas (1979), pg 53.

This sort of artillery was categorized as regimental artillery.  Organization  The Swedish field artillery consisted of 48 artillery pieces of caliber three to six pounds. The caliber was determined by the weight of the projectile rather than on the diameter of the pipe. There were 18 large 48 pounds pieces as well, but those were not used as regimental field artillery, but for more strategic purposes. Firing power The artillery during the early 18th century was developed further by Carl Cronstedt. He combined the powder and projectile into one single thin wooden cartridge called \\"geschwinda\\" shots (fast shots) and thereby succeeding in increasing the firing power to 10-12 rounds per minute. In addition, he increased the explosive power of the projectile itself. The range of the 6 pounders was 600‚Äì700 meters and the 3 pounders 225 meters.  Precision  Screws and aiming devices, invented by Christopher Polhem, were introduced and used to aim and adjust the elevation of the pipe.  Mobility  To drag the pieces, personnel from a musketeer division were temporarily assigned to carry the piece by sticking a pole (marching poles) through the cannon. The crew joined in by rolling the tires forward. Alternatively and/or in addition, a number of two horses (action horses) were used to pull the piece forward. Those horses were used as close as 70 meters from enemy lines. At closer ranges, only manpower was used to move it forward. In this manner the piece could advance at the rate of 1/2 or less of the foot regiment.  Operation  To serve a three to six pound piece, a minimum of four artillery men was required: one to put the geshwinda shot into the cannon, another to ram the shot down the barrel, a third to mount the fuse, and a fourth to fire the piece by a torch.

Petty crime such as pickpocketing and bag snatching does occur, but is extremely uncommon. Although incidents of violence are generally considered to be rare, violence has occurred more frequently due to increase in the population of Doha, the capital and largest city of Qatar, and economic pressures on expatriate workers during the last few years. Qatar is a destination country for men and women from South and Southeast Asia who migrate willingly, but are subsequently forced into involuntary servitude as domestic workers and laborers, and, to a lesser extent, commercial sexual exploitation. The most common offense was forcing workers to accept worse contract terms than those under which they were recruited. Other conditions include bonded labor, withholding of pay, restrictions on movement, arbitrary detention, and physical, mental, and sexual abuse.

Two versions of the band exist, the punk and metal crossover band featuring original drummer Andrew \\"Pinch\\" Pinching and second-era members Graham \\"Gizz\\" Butt and Adie Bailey and a punk-based one featuring original vocalist Pete \\"Wakey\\" Wakefield. History English Dogs formed in October 1981 in Grantham and produced two demos during 1982\\" \\"Show No Mercy\\" and \\"Free To Kill\\". The band toured as support to fellow punk band Charged GBH in Germany during early 1983 and followed this with a British tour supporting Discharge. In 1983 they signed to Clay Records and released a six-track EP, Mad Punx And English Dogs, in July 1983. English Dogs' first full-length album, Invasion of the Porky Men, was released a year later. Personnel changes ensued after the debut album emerged with vocalist Wakey departing to be replaced by ex-Ultraviolent singer Ade Bailey. At this juncture the band also decided to augment their live and recorded sound by adding former Destructors guitarist Graham \\"Gizz\\" Butt who added metal riffs and contributed to the English Dogs songwriting.Ian Glasper, Burning Britain, London: Cherry Red, 2004, p. 209. This change saw them leave Clay records to sign with Rot Records and release the decidedly metal tinged To the Ends of the Earth EP in September 1984. The metal leanings increased with Forward into Battle. English Dogs, culminating with the Metalmorphosis 12-inch and Where Legend Began album through Under One Flag in 1986. In Spring of that year the Dogs toured the US to sold-out shows on both the East and West coast. Upon their return to the UK Jon Murray left the band.The group appeared on the legendary Shades promoted Thrash bill at Camden's Electric Ballroom with Possessed and Voivod later in 1986. Pinch also left the band around Winter '86. The band carried on with Adie, Gizz and Wattie playing with other musicians until calling it a day late that year. In 1993, Pinch and Gizz Butt reformed English Dogs with \\"Mad Punx\\" vocalist Wakey and Future Damned bassist Stuart West, signed to German label, Impact Records, and released Bow To None, Wakey left shortly after with him being replaced by Stuart \\"Stu-Pid\\" Jones for the 1995 five-track EP, What a Wonderful Feeling... ...To Be Fucked By Everyone, on Retch Records. Eventually English Dogs became a three-piece with the line up of Gizz Butt on lead vocals and guitar, Pinch on drums and backing vocals, and Swapan Shop Nandi on bass and backing vocals. They released the 16-track crossover album, All the World's a Rage, also on Impact records, and toured the UK, Germany, Austria and Switzerland many times. In 1996 the English Dogs played their last shows as Pinch, Gizz and Shop were soon to re-emerge as Janus Stark. An English Dogs and GBH union resulted in Wakey and Pinch creating The Wernt with GBH members guitarist Jock Blyth and bassist Ross Lomas for a 1997 album 'Wreckin' Temples'. Gizz Butt replaced Jim Davies of Pitchshifter as the live guitarist for The Prodigy, which in turn revitalized interest in English Dogs and prompted a re-release of Where Legend Began. Gizz also announced the formation of a new act Janus Stark the same year recording with producer Terry Thomas. 1999's I've Got a Gun was recorded live in Finland in 1994 when Pid was on vocals. By 2000 Pinch had joined The Damned. Gizz Butt returned in 2002 with The More I See. In May 2007, English Dogs reformed with the original line-up with the exception of Pinch, who was drumming for The Damned. He was replaced by Stuart Meadows, who played for Resistance 77. They mainly play throughout Europe, but they do not play their crossover material. English Dogs released an EP called Tales of the Asylum in November 2008. English Dogs had another line-up change in 2009, then went on hiatus. In 2011, three original members of the 1984 crossover line up announced they were going to reform to perform the Forward into Battle and To the Ends of the Earth releases in their entirety. This led to a sell-out tour which received great reviews. After the tour they announced they were to write new material in the vein of the crossover material and plan more touring.

Founded in 1963, the company is known for its fire alarm notification appliances. History In 1970, Space Age Electronics introduced the first visual notification appliances, the AV32 and the AV34 light plate. They used relabeled Federal Vibratone 450D's for their series of 2DCD horns, which were often used with the AV32 or 34. Other popular horns used would be Wheelock 34T-24's, Wheelock 34's or speakers. These would also be used with horns made by other companies, generally Wheelock, Federal Signal, Faraday or Simplex models. Along with the AV32 and 34, they also introduced the V33 remote light, for situations where a retrofit would not be possible or no audible appliance was necessary. Sometime in the mid-1980s, Space Age introduced strobe versions of the AV32, AV34 and V33. Instead of using a dim incandescent light, it used a xenon strobe with a clear lens. The VA-series notification appliances were introduced in 1994, and ultimately replaced the AV32 series, which continued to be made until 1997. However, the V33 continued to be manufactured for general signaling purposes, and was replaced in 2006 by the Guardian Light. Current Products Space Age Electronics currently markets their IAV series of electronic horn/strobes and speaker/strobes. They also manufacture graphic annunciators, duct smoke detectors, relays, surge protectors, and various fire alarm/life safety accessories. Space Age's products are still used by many popular fire alarm companies, such as Honeywell (particularly the Gamewell-FCI and Notifier subsidiaries), Faraday, EST and Simplex.

It was named as Album of the Year by Terrorizer and was awarded the Norwegian \\"Spellemannprisen\\" for best metal album. The album sold approximately 1,100 copies in its first week in the United States, reaching number 49 on the Billboard Top Heatseekers chart. Writing and musical style Though Vertebrae's sound is rooted in black metal, AllMusic's Eduardo Rivadavia describes the album's sound as incorporating elements of jazz and art rock, while Blabbermouth wrote that Enslaved incorporate psychedelic influences and \\"have traveled light-years beyond the chainmail trappings that defined their early attempts at progressive black metal\\". Rivadavia also notes the \\"recurring dynamic contrasts between sheer violence and exquisite splendor\\" of the \\"multifaceted\\" and \\"frequently unpredictable\\" songs. The lyrics frequently reference Norse imagery and mythology. Kjellson has said that, \\"The title symbolizes the building stones in humanity, both physical and mentally, psychologically and biologically. Everything is closely tied together. You can say that the physics are the individual consciousness while the psychics are the outer consciousness. Micro/Macro-cosmos. Explained within mythological terms as the struggle (and also unity) between the Aesir and the giants.\\" The lyrics touch on themes of human potential, as well as human greed, stupidity and hypocrisy. \\"They describe how extremely fragile we are when it comes to matters such as materialism, religion, propaganda etc. Humans are extremely weak when it comes to individual behaviour, but we yet have a huge potential. This potential is often obscured somehow and the lyrics deals about different aspects of these matters, mine being the metaphorical/mythological while Ivar's the Psycho-surreal ones.\\"  Artwork  According to Kjellson, \\"On the cover you see the Vertebrae in the center, symbolizing the physical building stone. It stands alone to indicate both pride and that it is yet fragile. The blood veins that form the rune symbol (Mannar/Mannaz/Man) can be seen as the unity between mind and flesh.\\"  Critical reception  Vertebrae received positive reviews from critics upon release. Writing for AllMusic, Eduardo Rivadavia wrote that \\"Enslaved continue to represent the absolute evolutionary cutting edge of extreme metal, delivering in Vertebrae yet another spectacle of imagination and quality control, matched only by Sweden's equally consistent Opeth.\\" He praised the band's extensive range of influences as well as their complex songwriting. Blabbermouth also praised the diversity and creativity of the album, writing that, \\"The best thing about Enslaved is that they expanded their sound without discarding anything from their past ‚Äì black metal, their mid-period doomy vibe, the prog-rock spaciness of the last couple records, all mashed together in an improbable cohesion.\\" They concluded by writing, \\"It's all in here, it all works, and while it just about defies description, it's the band's most compelling work to date and it's a must-have for any adventurous fan, metal or otherwise.\\" Track listing Personnel Personnel adapted from AllMusic. *Grutle Kjellson ‚Äì bass guitar, vocals, art direction *Ivar Bj√∏rnson ‚Äì lead and rhythm guitars, art direction, engineering *Arve Isdal ‚Äì lead and rhythm guitars *Herbrand Larsen ‚Äì keyboards, synthesizers, vocals, engineering *Cato Bekkevold ‚Äì drums, percussion *Ronnie Le Tekr√∏ ‚Äì lead guitar on \\"Clouds\\" *George Marino - mastering *Joe Barresi - mixing *Truls Espedal - artwork  References  External links *Enslaved official website 2008 albums Enslaved (band) albums ","title":"Vertebrae (album)"},{"id":"19200823","text":"Bracken is an English post-rock band from Leeds, England.

Prior to the foundation of the Irish Free State, he was an alderman for a period. An active republican, he was a founding director of the Sinn F√©in Printing & Publishing Company. He also led the Sinn F√©in grouping in Dublin Corporation in the early 1900s. As a well-off supporter of the underground Irish republican movement in the early twentieth century, his house on Mountjoy Square seems to have been a regular meeting place for senior figures within that movement. The notes of Seamus Reader, an Irish Volunteer from Glasgow, record a meeting in January 1916 at Cole's house: all of whom were signatories to the Proclamation of the Irish Republic and all of whom were executed the following May, as leaders of the Easter Rising. Cole is also documented as having hosted provisional D√°il meetings at his home, the assembly having been driven underground in September 1919. He was arrested by the military at his home at No. 3 Mountjoy Square in 1920. After the Anglo-Irish Treaty and the foundation of the Irish Free State, he was elected a pro-Treaty Sinn F√©in Teachta D√°la (TD) to the 3rd D√°il √âireann for Cavan constituency at the 1922 general election. The \\"Pro-Treaty\\" prefix relates to his position in the Irish Civil War. It is perhaps surprising that a Dublin man won in Cavan. He and Se√°n Milroy stood alongside Arthur Griffith with one other opponent, Patrick Baxter of the Farmers' Party and three seats available. Griffith received by far the largest popular vote (54%) with Baxter second (23%), Cole third (20%) and Milroy fourth (2%). As the Irish voting system uses proportional representation, Cole and Milroy were elected on the back of Griffith's surplus votes who had achieved more than twice the required quota. Cole stood again in Cavan as a Cumann na nGaedheal candidate at the following 1923 general election. Griffith died during the Civil War by that time and Baxter topped the poll, this time with Milroy second. Cole was eliminated on the sixth count, despite there being an extra fourth seat. Cole unsuccessfully ran for election to Seanad √âireann in 1925. He was later a commissioner for Mountjoy Square.

It could be classified as a game show, though there were no prizes to be won. Each episode, a local celebrity would issue a series of five themed challenges to a particular town or city, usually tasks which required a great deal of manpower and creativity. The inhabitants of the competing town or city had roughly six days to complete these task, ending in an event on Saturday afternoon where their efforts were judged, and symbolic \\"gold stars\\" were awarded for each task successfully completed. Both this event and the preparations during the week were taped and broadcast the following Sunday evening, with the next challenge presented at the end of the programme. Challenges included breaking world records, assembling masses in a particular style of fancy dress, building scale replicas of monuments, and retrieving items from foreign countries or outer space. The first series was presented by Geena Lisa and Sergio. The latter left the program in 2007 and was replaced by Steph Goossens for the final two series.

The chain specialized in low-cost, Southern-style food. Branches were located in the Southeastern United States from Washington, D.C. to Atlanta, Georgia. History The company was organized in 1920, by Frank Odell Sherrill and Fred Weber who had served as mess sergeants together in World War I.Historic Asheville S&W; Update, by Mark Barnett, Asheville Citizen Times, May 29, 2007. The operation originated at Ivey's department store which was located in Charlotte. The initial restaurant was located at 100 W. Trade Street in downtown Charlotte. By 1934, when the first Washington, D.C. location opened, cafeterias were located in Atlanta, Georgia; Asheville, Charlotte, and Raleigh, North Carolina; Chattanooga and Knoxville, Tennessee; and Roanoke, Virginia. By the early 1950s, locations had opened at Greensboro, North Carolina and at Pittman Plaza, in Lynchburg, Virginia. Many of these locations were designed by noted Charlotte-based architect Martin Evans Boyer.Finding aid to Martin Evans Boyers Papers, 1910-1993; University of North Carolina Charlotte, Manuscript Collection 94 (retrieved Sep 6, 2008). The original cafeterias were located in busy downtown areas, often located near bustling theater and shopping areas. The early locations were quite opulent (designed in Art Deco style) and were the site of numerous local business and political gatherings. During the 1960s‚Äì1970s, as suburban shopping centers opened and downtowns declined, S&W; followed the trend by closing their downtown locations. In 1964, 16 locations were in operation.\\"New S&W; Cafeteria,\\" The Washington Post, Times Herald, Sep 20, 1964, p. C12. Into the 1990s, the mainstay clientele were the elderly who appreciated the home- style meals at low prices.

The WNT gene family consists of structurally related genes that encode secreted signaling proteins. These proteins have been implicated in oncogenesis and in several developmental processes, including regulation of cell fate and patterning during embryogenesis. This gene is a member of the WNT gene family, which are involved in the Wnt signaling pathway. It is overexpressed in cervical cancer cell line and strongly coexpressed with another family member, WNT10A, in colorectal cancer cell line. The gene overexpression may play key roles in carcinogenesis. This gene and the WNT10A gene are clustered in the chromosome 2q35 region. The protein encoded by this gene is 97% identical to the mouse Wnt6 protein at the amino acid level. Role in Development Wnt6 plays a role in the formation and maturation of different embryonic structures, namely the fetal heart, ventral body wall, and somite derived structures. Wnt6, through the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, inhibits the induction of cardiogenic mesoderm. For this reason, Wnt6 inhibitors like Cerberus must be present to allow the cells to be induced. Knockout models show that without Wnt6 the fetus develops an enlarged heart, while upregulating Wnt6 results in the heart being underdeveloped. Several Wnts, including Wnt6, have shown to be involved in the formation of the ventral body wall and when inhibited result in birth defects such as failure of the wall to close, hypoplasia of the musculature, and other defects. Following the formation of the somites from the Paraxial Mesoderm, the outermost cells of the somites undergo a mesenchymal to epithelial transition. Wnt6 is expressed by the overlying ectoderm and promotes the production of Paraxis, which facilitates the transition. While many structures will still form if Wnt6 is knocked out, the structures (ribs, vertebra, and muscles) are fused and not organized properly. On the other hand, if Wnt6 is upregulated, muscle in the limbs and surrounding areas are decreased as the mesenchymal progenitor cells that migrate and become the muscle are locked in the somite as epithelial cells.

Two of these were built in Czechoslovakia; the other 46 were built as the Strv m/37 under license by Jungner in Oskarshamn, with AB Volvo providing a more powerful engine, transmission, and tracks, the armor was made by Avesta. The ƒåKD supplied most of the other components after building one prototype. The tankette was strongly modified, including the suppression of original driver's machine gun, this variant was heavier and larger, than the AH-IV. On the turret, was placed two Swedish-made machine guns, the 8 mm Ksp m/36 strv and a commander cupola. Inside the vehicle was room for a radio and the ammunition. In November 1938, the final components were shipped.Kliment and Francev, p. 115, 282  Production  A total of 48 of these vehicles were delivered to the Swedish army between 1938 and 1939.

The community bases its ideology on the Visigothic, Suevian and Vandalian Germanic heritage of modern Spain, Portugal and Occitania, dating to the 6th century. It was legally recognised as a religious institution by the Spanish government in 2007, and performed the first legal pagan wedding in mainland Spain since the Visigothic era, in Barcelona on 23 December 2007. In Albacete in 2009, COE completed the first temple to Odin believed to have been built in over 1,000 years. A less Odin- focused group split off in 2012 as the √Åsatr√∫ Lore Vanatr√∫ Assembly (ALVA).http://www.asatru-vanatru.com/ Odinism background hexapetalus is the logo of the COE. The term Odinism was coined by Orestes Brownson in his 1848 \\"Letter to Protestants\\".The Works of Orestes A. Brownson: Containing the Second Part of the Political Writings, ed. Henry Francis Brownson; T. Nourse (1884), p. 257 The term was re-introduced in the late 1930s by Alexander Rud Mills in Australia with his First Anglecyn Church of Odin and his book The Call of Our Ancient Nordic Religion. In the 1960s and early 1970s, Else Christensen's Odinist Study Group and later the Odinist Fellowship brought the term into usage in North America. Odinists do not necessarily focus on the worship of Odin, and most honour the full Germanic pantheon. is an reconstructed Old Norse compound word derived from or (referring to the √Üsir, one of the two families of gods in Norse paganism, led by Odin; the other being the Vanir), combined with , literally \\"troth\\" or \\"faith\\". Thus, √Åsatr√∫ is the 'Faith of the √Üsir'). Vanatr√∫ was coined after √Åsatr√∫, implying a focus on the Vanir. History Under the influence of Christensen's group, Ernesto (\\"Ernust\\") Garc√≠a and Isabel Rubio founded the Spanish Odinist Circle () in Spain in 1981. Christensen gave her blessing to this organisation, and recognized it in the year of its founding.Else Christensen It later broadened into the Odinist Community of Spain ‚Äì √Åsatr√∫ (. Since 2007, the organisation has also used the name \\"European Odinist Circle\\" (C√≠rculo Odinista Europeo), after years of broader promotion of Odinism, and a shift back toward a focus on Odinism over √Åsatr√∫ and Vanatr√∫. The Europeo name is especially used by local congregations who are outside Spain or Spanish-speaking areas of Spain. In 2006 the COE began a campaign against the destruction of an archaeological site in the ancient capital of the Visigoths, Toledo. Pressure was applied by COE, among others, on Jose Maria Barreda, who was then the local president of the autonomous community of Castile‚ÄìLa Mancha, and the site was preserved, containing the remains of a Visigothic settlement, which has since been declared a national monument.Gothic City COE went from being simply a cultural organisation to a religious institution officially recognized by the Spanish government, in 2007,http://www.troth.org.uk/history.htm A Potted History of Modern Heathenism. under the name of Comunidad Odinista de Espa√±a- Asatru,Register of the minority religions of the Spanish Ministry of Justice allowing them to perform \\"legally binding civil ceremonies\\" (weddings). COE has been the fourth Odinist and Asatruar religious organisation to have been recognized with official status in the world, after organisations in Iceland, Norway and Denmark. While no such recognition is necessary in some countries, including the United States (where pagan weddings have been performed for many decades at least), in many jurisdictions, especially in predominantly Catholic countries or those with a state religion, this sort of official sanction can be very difficult to earn. , European Odinist Circle has requested a declaration of Notorio arraigo from the Spanish government. If granted, this status of 'Deeply Rooted' would make Germanic paganism the first polytheistic religious denomination established in Spain which has equal legal standing with Christianity under the Advisory Commission on Religious Freedom (CALR) of the Spanish Ministry of Justice, ahead even of Hinduism in Spain. In 2014, a census of COE's extended Odinist community totalled over 10,000 membersRevista de Estudios Alicantinos with a presence throughout the whole country. Numbers in Europe beyond Spain are unclear. Structure The organisation is headed by the or President, who is the primary legal executive, social representative, and religious officiating figure in the COE. Below the Reiki, the Priestly Order Halirunae (in Spanish: ) is composed of three types of roles: the go√∞ar (singular go√∞i 'priest' or gy√∞ja 'priestess'); and two types of seiderkner (roughly, 'shamans'), the spaekona ('seer'), who performs spae magic (prophecy and divination), and the seidkona (roughly, 'sorcerer'), devoted to seid magic (clairvoyance and high magic) as well as leading the ceremonial functions. Any person, male or female, may fill any of these roles. However, a member of the seider must be considered by the congregation to demonstrably possess paranormal abilities or gifts; the go√∞ar roles are more clerical and have no such requirement. Alberto Paredes was elected president in 2009. In late 2011, co-founder Ernust Garc√≠a was elected as president again, after the resignation of Paredes. Garc√≠a combines this role with that of the Allsherjargo√∞i (basically 'chieftain', from the historical Icelandic warlord title), and the Ufargo√∞i ('high priest') of the community. Since 2007, the go√∞ar have been governed by Go√∞i Angel Arroyo, and since 2008 the order of seiderkner by Seidkona Maria Angeles Lozano. Geographically, COE is organized in kindreds, local worship groups that, depending on the population density of their area, may range from citywide to regional. Beliefs Else Christensen's memorial stone placed at the COE temple in Albacete. The body of COE's doctrine is promulgated under the name Continental Odinist Rite. In addition to naturally adopting the moral code of the Odinist religion, the Nine Noble Virtues, as part of its creed, COE has added its own set of nine Programmatic Points: #Odinism, our ancestral religion in Europe. #The religion of the future. #The Gods and the sacred. #A code of values as a vital livelihood. #Odinism as a lifestyle. #The world, man, soul and body. #Respect for diversity. Fight for identity. #Religion, politics, and society. #Everything perishes, everything returns to be. The Odinist Community of Spain is also studying carefully the ideas of Rupert Sheldrake on the concept of morphic fields, and Carl Jung on collective unconscious, as \\"very close to the Germanic ideas surrounding Ur√∞arbrunnr\\", the legendary Well of Ur√∞r. The organisation also accepts American Asatruer Stephen McNallen's concept of metagenetics, \\"the hypothesis that there are spiritual or metaphysical implications to physical relatedness among humans which correlate with, but go beyond, the known limits of genetics\\". Holy days While there are many holidays and events in √Åsatr√∫, the following are official in the European Odinist Circle: ;January (Snowmoon) :January 21: Anniversary of the founding of the Spanish Odinist Circle in 1981. ;April (Grasameno√æs) :First full moon after the vernal equinox: Ostara festival. It represents the beginning of life after winter, when light and life come back into the souls of men. ;May (Merrymoon) :May 1: Walpurgisnacht. Shamanic ceremony where Odin is represented by self-sacrifice at the great World Tree, Yggdrasil. May 4: Remembrance day for Else Christensen. Mother of Odinism, who died May 4, 2005. ;June (Sunnameno√æs) :June 21: Summer solstice. Festival to honor the god Balder. ;September (Shedding) :2nd Saturday of September: Day of Odinism. National Meeting (Althing, from the ancient Icelandic parliament) of the whole congregation of COE, when a special bl√≥t (sacrifice and sacramental feast) to the gods and an Odinismic Confessional is conducted. ;October (Wintrufulli√æs) :October 16: Day of Vidarr, god of silence and revenge. Day of remembrance for martyrs. ;November (Fruma Jiuleis) :November 1: Day of Heimfall (and corresponds with Celtic Samhain). Feast where death and life are separated by a line so thin, one may pass in both directions, through shamanic rituals. November 9: Feast of the Einherjar, heroes worthy to gather in Valhalla in the afterlife. ;December (Afra Jiuleis) :December 21: Yule, a festival consisting of the 12 days after the winter solstice, and the most important event for Odinism. It represents the victory of the sun over the darkness, and is a time to make solemn oaths and take part in special festivities for the god Freyr. First marriage On 23 December 2007, the first legal pagan wedding in mainland Spain in over 1,500 years took place on the beaches of Vilanova i la Geltr√∫, in the Barcelona province of Catalonia.Disciples of Odin in Albacete A heterosexual couple in the Odinist Community of Spain (identified in the press only as \\"Jordi\\" and \\"Francesca\\" for privacy reasons) were wed under the Continental Odinist Rite, led by then-Go√∞i (and co-founder) Ernust Garc√≠a of the COE. The ceremony was attended by members of the COE as well as by neopagans of all denominations in Spain, including the Ancient Religious Society of Kelt, the Wiccan Silver Willow Coven, and the Pagan Federation, as the historic occasion marked the first time in Spanish history that paganism of any kind had achieved legal recognition to conduct weddings, under the Spanish regulations of religious rites of minority religions in the country. An earlier (non-European-based) neopagan wedding took place in modern Spanish territory. It was held in 2002 in Tenerife, Canary Islands, and carried out by members of the neopagan group Church of the Guanche People (named for the Guanches, ancient inhabitants of the Canary Islands before the conquest of the archipelago by Spain in the fifteenth century).Un 5% de canarios profesa una religi√≥n minoritaria. La Opini√≥n de Tenerife This Canarian religious organisation is not officially recognized by Spanish authorities as such an institution, because it is linked to the independence movement in the islands. Nevertheless, the event was taken as a positive sign by religious minorities in the Canaries and Spain.Hernando de Larramendi, Miguel; Garc√≠a Ortiz, Puerto Religion.es: Minor√≠as religiosas en Castilla‚ÄìLa Mancha [Religion.es: Minority Religions in Castile‚ÄìLa Mancha] Fundaci√≥n Pluralismo y Convivencia y la Universidad de Castilla‚ÄìLa Mancha, Icaria editorial. see p. 311 (Spanish) Temple Templo de Gaut, Navas de Jorquera: first temple dedicated to Odin in the last 1,000 years. One of the pillar projects of the reformed OSE was to build a temple. In Navas de Jorquera, a town of Albacete in Castile-La Mancha, OCE legally acquired the ruin of a very old building with a long history relating to early period of the settlement. It was completely rebuilt by OSE, beginning in mid-2005, constructed in the form of three traditional halls:http://lavozdeodin.com/2015/06/04/entrevista-a-ernesto-garcia- presidente-y-fundador-de-coe/Norse Mythology Legends of Gods and Heroes by Peter Andreas Munch . pag 268 #Hall devoted to the Aesir. #Hall devoted to the Vanir. #Shields hall, used for celebrations. The building, the Templo de Gaut (from Gautr, one of the many names of Odin), was completed in 2009, duly consecrated, and has been in use since then. It is the only outdoor temple on a historic site in Spain that is legally in active use, since all others are included in the system of state monuments, and rituals cannot be performed in them. A memorial stone for modern Odinism pioneer Else Christensen is housed in the temple.

He notably for Celtic, Barnsley and Grimsby Town. He also played for Motherwell, Doncaster Rovers, Rotherham United, Scarborough, Southport, Gainsborough Trinity, Boston United and Whitby Town. Career A schoolboy international, Dobbin started his career at Celtic. In 1982, he was part of the Scotland under-18 squad which won the European Under-19 Championship, although he missed out due to injury. Dobbin's chances at Celtic were limited and he made only a handful of league appearances, with a similar return from a loan spell at Motherwell. In March 1984, Dobbin left Scotland and moved to Doncaster Rovers, signing alongside Scotland under-18 colleague John Philliben. Dobbin spent two-and-a- half years at Belle Vue before moving to Barnsley in 1986. Spending five years at Oakwell, Dobbin featured in over 100 league matches for The Tykes, before beginning the first of two spells with Grimsby Town in 1991. Dobbin's ¬£200,000 move saw him go on to make over 150 league appearances for Grimsby before his release at the end of the 1995‚Äì96 season. From here, Dobbin spent a year with Rotherham United, appearing in around half of the club's matches before re- joining Doncaster for the 1997‚Äì98 season. A regular during this season, Doncaster were struggling at the bottom and released Dobbin before the end of the season, allowing him to join Scarborough. After just one match, Dobbin returned to Grimsby, featuring twice in the remainder of the season. He played another four matches at the start of the following season before being loaned to Southport for the latter part. In 1999-00, Dobbin spent time with three part-time clubs, turning out for Gainsborough Trinity, Boston United and Whitby Town before retiring at the end of the season. Personal life After his retirement from football, Dobbin worked on a building site, and as a gas engineer for Npower. He also covers Barnsley home games for Opta. His daughter Beth Dobbin is an athlete who broke the Scottish women's 200m record in 2018 and represented Great Britain and Northern Ireland at the 2018 Athletics World Cup. Masters football Since his retirement he has played in three Masters football tournaments for Celtic once and twice for Barnsley. Most recently, he helped to guide Barnsley to local victory in the Yorkshire masters and even struck home a thunderous right- footed strike in the final against Sheffield Wednesday to force the game into penalties where he tucked his away past the despairing Kevin Pressman.

Its early 15th century Jiz≈ç hall is a registered National Treasure of Japan. It is considered to be the oldest intact building in Tokyo Prefecture and a unique example of Kamakura period architecture. History Shofuku-ji was founded in 1270, during the Kamakura period. The temple records state that a Jiz≈ç hall was built in 1278 under the sponsorship of Kamakura Regent H≈çj≈ç Tokiyori. Tradition holds that the Regent fell ill while on hunting expedition and was nursed back to health back by a resident priest. In gratitude, Tokiyori commissioned builders from Kamakura to build the Jiz≈ç hall.Coaldrake (1996) pp. 97‚Äì103 There is some question as to the accuracy of this story given that Tokiyori died in 1263. Nonetheless, official patronage from the Kamakura shogunate was key in the temple construction. It is worth noting that the temple may have been founded and constructed during the ministry of Tokiyori's son, H≈çj≈ç Tokimune under whose authority Japan successfully defended itself against Mongol Invasions.Papinot (1910) p. 165 The current Jizo hall was rebuilt in 1407, according to an inscription in India ink discovered in 1933, when the Jizo hall was repaired. The writing also stated that this temple has been dedicated to Jizo Bodhisattva since this was founded. This temple remains largely in its original configuration since the time it was founded.ÂõΩÂÆùÂ§ßËæûÂÖ∏ ÂÖ®‰∫îÂ∑ª ‰∫î Âª∫ÈÄ†Áâ©(1985) p. 277 Architecture The Sh≈çfuku-ji Jiz≈ç hall employed new building techniques perfected by the Japanese master builders during the Kamakura era that permitted more strength, elasticity, and detail compared to Chinese, Korean, or earlier Japanese techniques. From the outside it appears as a two-story structure with sharply upturned eaves on the roofs. Internally, it is a single open space. This effect results from the lower roof mokoshi. This is called Zensh≈´y≈ç. This style can be seen at Shariden of Enkaku-ji in Kamakura. For example, the curve of the upper roof is similar. However, there are some differences. For example, the mokoshi of the Sh≈çfuku-ji Jizo hall is covered with copper for good conservation. The door opens towards the inside. It contains significant architectural innovations, including the use of elastic Japanese cypress, steel support chisels, decorative but functional brackets, and cantilevers. These innovations permitted a structure that appears lightweight with its curved hip roof, open interior, and floating, upturned eaves while being structurally sound against earthquakes.Coaldrake (1996) pp. 97‚Äì103 The material of roofs has been thatched. However, in 1933, when the hall was repaired, the roof was changed from thatched to shingled to restore it closer to the original construction configuration. This is made by piling thin boards and fixing using bamboo nails. This ‚ÄúKokerabuki‚Äù is also seen in Katsura Imperial Villa and Kinkaku-ji. The building was designated a National Treasure on March 29, 1952. Laymen are permitted to enter the building only once a year, during the festival for Jizo, or ‚ÄúJizo-matsuri‚Äù held on November 3.ÂõΩÂÆùÂ§ßËæûÂÖ∏ ÂÖ®‰∫îÂ∑ª ‰∫î Âª∫ÈÄ†Áâ©(1985) p. 277Êó•Êú¨ÁæéË°ìÂõ≥Ëß£‰∫ãÂÖ∏(2004)http://www.city.higashimurayama.tokyo.jp/tanoshimi/photo/shiki/7_9.html#cms75502 Significance Despite major reconstruction in 1407, Sh≈çfuku-ji's Jiz≈ç hall is held to be one of the most representative and intact examples of Kamakura architecture.Coaldrake (1996) pp. 97‚Äì103 Though 50 kilometers from Kamakura, this area marked the northern extent of what was considered the outer sphere of the Kamakura defenses.Sansom (1963) p. 19 However, this remoteness likely contributed to its preservation since it did not see the destruction that most of the buildings of Kamakura itself experienced. Traditions Consistent with it being a place of healing, Sh≈çfuku-ji has a tradition that is believed by many locals to help cure illness. Outside the hall are a number of wooden dolls that, when a family member or friend is sick, are to be taken to the ill person's home. Upon recovery, the original doll plus a new one are returned to the temple.Signposts at Sh≈çfuku-ji Jiz≈ç Hall gallery file:Shofukuji- Exterior-North-DoorOpen.jpgExterior North file:Shofukuji-Exterior-South- Open.jpgExterior South file:Shofukuji-Exterior-West-DoorOpen.jpgExterior West file:Shofukuji-Interior-CentralCeiling.jpgInterior East Ceiling file:Shofukuji-Interior-EastCeiling.jpgInterior East file:Shofukuji-Interior- EastLowerLevel.jpgInterior East Lower level file:Shofukuji-Interior- KannonStatue.jpgInterior K·π£itigarbha Statue file:Shofukuji-Interior- NorthLowerLevel.jpgInterior North Lower Level file:Shofukuji-Interior- PriestBeforeKannon.jpgInterior Priest file:Shofukuji-Interior- WestCeiling.jpgInterior West Ceiling file:Shofukuji-Exterior- EaveDetail.JPGExterior Eave detail  See also  * Glossary of Japanese Buddhism ‚Äì terms concerning Japanese Buddhism, Buddhist art, and Buddhist temple architecture References * Papinot, E.

From 1662, a base was established in Ayutthaya, Siam, by Mgr Lambert de la Motte and Mgr Pallu, from where numerous attempts were made to send missionaries to Vietnam. Pierre Lambert de la Motte. Meanwhile, the Jesuits under the Portuguese Padroado continued their efforts in Vietnam. In 1658, Fathers Manoel Ferreira and Frenchman Joseph Tissanier arrived in Tonkin,T·∫°, p.99 but they were expelled in 1664 under the rule of Tr·ªãnh T·∫°c, and fled to Ayutthaya.Les Missions Etrangeres, p.54 In June 1666, the Ayutthaya base of the Paris Foreign Missions Society dispatched Father Fran√ßois Deydier to Tonkin, who was able to reorganize Catholics there, although he remained in hiding.Les Missions Etrangeres, p.55 Mgr Lambert de la Motte himself would also visit the mission in Tonkin in 1669 and reinforce the organization there, under cover of trading activities of the French East India Company. In 1680, the French East India Company opened a factory in Ph·ªë Hi·∫øn.Chapuis, A History, p.172 The famous Frenchman Pierre Poivre visited Vietnam from 1720. The Nguy·ªÖn lords, perceived with higher degree of religious tolerance, allowed Christian worshippers from France and establishing their bases, although not allowing churches to be built. This resulted with the heavy influence of Christianity in the south than the north, a major contributing factor for the Christian presence in Southern Vietnam in the future. Military collaboration (1787‚Äì1820) The Citadel of Saigon was built by Olivier de Puymanel for Nguy·ªÖn Ph√∫c √Ånh according to the designs of Vauban in 1790. Towards the end of the 18th century, the T√¢y S∆°n rebellion overthrew the Nguy·ªÖn family, but one of its members Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh, future Emperor Gia Long, with the aid of the French Catholic priest Pigneau de B√©haine, titular bishop of Adran, obtained a treaty of alliance with the French king Louis XVI:Kamm, p. 86. the Treaty of Versailles, signed on November 21, 1787.Chapuis, A History, p.175 In return Gia Long promised to cede Pulo-Condore to the French and to give a concession to the French in Tourane (modern Da Nang), as well as exclusive trading rights. That treaty marks the beginning of French influence in Indochina, but the Governor in Pondicherry, Count de Conway, refused to follow through with the implementation of the treaty, leaving Pigneau de B√©haine to his own means. In spite of these inconveniences, between 1789 and 1799, a French force mustered by Pigneau de B√©haine managed to support Gia Long in acquiring sway over the whole of Vietnam.Chapuis, A History, p. 173-179 The French trained Vietnamese troops, established a navy, and built fortifications in the Vauban style, such as the Citadel of Saigon or the Citadel of Duy√™n Khanh. Several of these French adventurers would remain in high positions in the government of Gia Long such as Philippe Vannier, Jean- Baptiste Chaigneau, de Forsans and the doctor Despiau. Frigate Th√©tis, 1813 model. Mus√©e National de la Marine (Rochefort). The death of Gia Long, and the accession of Emperor Minh M·∫°ng in 1820 severely strained relations between France and Vietnam. In an effort to reestablish close contacts, Jean-Baptiste Chaigneau was nominated French Consul in Hu·∫ø. He offered a peace treaty, but remained unsuccessful, and left Vietnam definitively with Philippe Vannier and their families in December 1824. On 12 January 1825, an embassy led by Captains Hyacinthe de Bougainville and Courson de la Ville-H√©lio arrived in ƒê√† N·∫µng, with the warships Th√©tis and Esp√©rance.Chapuis, A History, p. 190 Although they had numerous presents from the Emperor and a letter from Louis XVIII delivered on 8 January 1824, the ambassadors could not obtain an audience from Minh M·∫°ng.Chapuis, The Last Emperors, p. 4 Resistance to missionaries In 1825, emperor Minh M·∫°ng issued an edict prohibiting foreign missionaries in Vietnam, following the infiltration of Father Reg√©reau from the Th√©tis when it was anchored in ƒê√† N·∫µng.McLeod, p.27 In his edict, Minh M·∫°ng asserted that Christianity perverted the people: As the prohibition proved largely ineffective, and missionaries continued their activities in Vietnam, especially under the protection of the governor of Cochinchina L√™ VƒÉn Duy·ªát, a total ban on Roman Catholicism as well as French and Vietnamese priests was enacted following their support of the L√™ VƒÉn Kh√¥i revolt (1833‚Äì1835), leading to persecutions of French missionaries and the execution of Father Joseph Marchand in 1835. These events fed in France a desire to intervene and protect the Roman Catholic faith. Attempt at overture Following the defeat of China by Great Britain in the Opium War, emperor Minh M·∫°ng attempted to build an alliance with European powers by sending a delegation under the mandarin Ton That Tuong in 1840. They were received in Paris by Prime Minister Marshal Soult and the Commerce Minister, but they were shunned by King Louis-Philippe. This came after the Paris Foreign Missions Society and the Vatican had urged a rebuke for an \\"enemy of the religion\\". The embassy offered in vain a trade monopoly for France, in exchange for the promise of military support in case of an attack by another country.Honey, p. 43: \\"In 1840 he sent an embassy led by the mandarin Ton That Tuong to France offering the French the monopoly of European trade with Vietnam, in return for an undertaken to defend the country in the event of an attack.\\" An attempt to make a treaty with America also failed when Minh M·∫°ng died in 1841. Minh M·∫°ng's successor, Thi·ªáu Tr·ªã, also upheld the anti-Catholic policy of his predecessor but tried to avoid direct confrontations. Captain Favin-L√©v√™que, arriving in ƒê√† N·∫µng in 1840 on board the corvette H√©ro√Øne, obtained from Thi·ªáu Tr·ªã the release of five imprisoned missionaries. Naval interventions (1843-1847) The first attack by France against Vietnam occurred under the command of Jean-Baptiste C√©cille in 1847. In 1843, the French Foreign Minister, Fran√ßois Guizot, sent a fleet to the East under Admiral Jean- Baptiste C√©cille and Captain Charner, together with the diplomat Lagrene. The move responded to the successes of the British in China in 1842, and France hoped to counterbalance these successes by accessing China from the south. The pretext however was to support British efforts in China, and to fight the persecution of French missionaries in Vietnam.Tucker, p.27 In 1845, C√©cille was dispatched to Vietnam in order to obtain the release of Bishop Dominique Lef√®bvre, who had been condemned to death (the request for the intervention of the French Navy had been transmitted to C√©cille by Captain John Percival of the USS Constitution).Chapuis, A History, p.194 In 1847, C√©cille sent two warships (Gloire and Victorieuse) under Captains Lapierre and Rigault de Genouilly to ƒê√† N·∫µng (Tourane) in Vietnam to obtain the liberation of two imprisoned French missionaries, Bishop Dominique Lef√®bvre (imprisoned for a second time as he had re-entered Vietnam secretly) and Duclos, and freedom of worship for Catholics in Vietnam.Tucker, p.28Chapuis, The Last Emperors, p.5 Quote: Two years later, in 1847, Lefebvre was again captured when he returned to Vietnam. This time Cecille sent captain Lapierre to Da Nang. Whether Lapierre was aware or not that Lefebvre had already been freed and on his way back to Singapore, the French first dismantled masts of some Vietnamese ships. Later on April 14, 1847, in only one hour, the French sank the last five bronze-plated vessels in the bay of Da Nang. As negotiations drew on without results, on April 15, 1847, a fight named the Bombardment of ƒê√† N·∫µng erupted between the French fleet and Vietnamese ships, four Vietnamese ships were sunk as a result. The French fleet then sailed away. Territorial conquest In 1858, Charles Rigault de Genouilly attacked Vietnam under the orders of Napoleon III following the failed mission of diplomat Charles de Montigny. His stated mission was to stop the persecution of Catholic missionaries in the country and assure the unimpeded propagation of the faith.Tucker, p.29 Rigault de Genouilly, with 14 French gunships, 3,000 men and 300 Filipino troops provided by the Spanish,Chapuis, A History, p.195 attacked the port of ƒê√† N·∫µng in 1858, causing significant damages, and occupying the city. After a few months, Rigault had to leave the city due to supply issues and illnesses. Conquest of Cochinchina (1862-1874) Capture of Saigon by Charles Rigault de Genouilly on 18 February 1859, painted by Antoine Morel-Fatio. Sailing south, De Genouilly then accomplished the Capture of Saigon, a poorly defended city, on 18 February 1859. De Genouilly was criticized for his actions and was replaced by Admiral Page in November 1859, with instructions to obtain a treaty protecting the Roman Catholic faith in Vietnam, but not to try to obtain territorial gains. Due to the resumption of fighting in China during the Second Opium War, Admiral Page had to divert most of his force to China, to support Admiral Charner there. In April 1860, Page was recalled to France and replaced by captain d‚ÄôAries.Chapuis, The Last Emperors, p.49 The Franco- Spanish force in Saigon, now only numbering about 1,000, was besieged by about 10,000 Vietnamese forces from March 1860 to February 1861. Finally, following the French victory in China at the Battle of Palikao, reinforcements of 70 ships under Admiral Charner and 3,500 soldiers under General Vassoigne were dispatched to Saigon, so that the French were able to defeat the besieging Vietnamese at the battle of Chin Hoa (Ky Hoa) on 25 February 1861.Goldstein, p.95 Admiral Bonnard forced the entrance of the Mekong river, and seized M·ªπ Tho.Randier, p.380 On 13 April 1862, the Vietnamese government was forced to negotiate and officially cede the territories of Bi√™n H√≤a, Gia ƒê·ªãnh and ƒê·ªãnh T∆∞·ªùng to France in the 1862 Treaty of Saigon, confirmed by the Treaty of Hu·∫ø (1863). Phan Thanh Gi·∫£n in Paris in 1863. An embassy was sent to France under Phan Thanh Gi·∫£n in 1863, to try to recover the territories lost to France.Tran & Reid, p.207. Although Napoleon III initially accepted Phan Thanh Gi·∫£n's plea, the agreement was finally canceled in 1864, under pressure from Napoleon's cabinet led by the Minister of the Navy and the Colonies Chasseloup-Laubat. In 1864, all the French territories in southern Vietnam were declared to be the new French colony of Cochinchina. In 1866, France started the exploration of the Mekong river, with the objective of reaching the riches of China, under Ernest Doudart de Lagr√©e and Francis Garnier. They reached the Yunnan, discovering that the Mekong was not navigable as far as China. They found out instead that the Song-Ko√Ø river in Tonkin would be a good alternative.Randier, p.381 In 1867 the provinces of Ch√¢u ƒê·ªëc, H√† Ti√™n and Vƒ©nh Long were added to French-controlled territory by Admiral La Grandi√®re. Admiral Dupr√© became Governor of Cochinchina. The Vietnamese Emperor formally recognized French dominion over Cochinchina in 1874, in the 1874 Treaty of Saigon,Brecher & Wilkenfeld, p.179 negotiated by Paul-Louis-F√©lix Philastre. Protectorate over Annam and Tonkin (1883) Henri Rivi√®re was killed by the Black Flags in 1883. In 1873, Francis Garnier was put in charge of an expedition to Tonkin, with the mission of protecting French interests there, following the troubles encountered by the French trader Jean Dupuis. Garnier disembarked in Hanoi on 3 November 1873, but negotiations were not forthcoming. On November 20, Garnier made an assault of the Hanoi citadelle, and pacified the delta, with nine officers, 175 men and two gunboats. The Black Flags resisted the French intrusion, entering into a guerrilla campaign that led to the killing of Garnier on 21 December 1873. Admiral Courbet in Hu·∫ø. In March 1882, Captain Henri Rivi√®re again visited Hanoi with three gunboats and 700 men in order to obtain a trade agreement. Following some provocations, Rivi√®re captured Hanoi in April 1882. Again the Black Flags counter-attacked, and Rivi√®re was killed in May 1883 in the Battle of Paper Bridge, leading to a huge movement in favour of a massive armed intervention in France.Randier, p.382 Credits were voted for, and a large force of 4,000 men and 29 warships (including 4 ironclads) was sent. Admiral Am√©d√©e Courbet would be leading the force in Tonkin, while Admiral Meyer would operate in China. Following a failed ultimatum, on 18‚Äì19 August 1883, Courbet bombarded the forts of the capital of Hu·∫ø. The forts were occupied on the 20th. The gunboats Lynx and Vip√®re reached the capital. On August 25, the Vietnamese court accepted to sign the Treaty of Hu√© (1883). A French protectorate over the remaining of Vietnam (Annam and Tonkin) was recognized through the treaty.Sondhaus, p.75: \\"Rear Admiral Courbet blockaded Hu·∫ø in August 1883 and directed an assault on its citadel, forcing the capitulation of the emperor of Annam\\"Chapuis, The Last Emperors p.66 Tonkin Campaign (1883-85) and Sino- French War (1884-85) capture of S∆°n T√¢y, 16 December 1883. The next objective of the French was to take full control of the Tonkin. In October 1883, Courbet was placed in command of the Tonkin Expeditionary Corps. In December 1883, he led the S∆°n T√¢y Campaign against the Black Flags.Randier, p.383 French casualties were heavy (83 dead and 320 wounded), but the Black Flags were very weakened as a result of the campaign. B·∫Øc Ninh. The B·∫Øc Ninh Campaign (March 1884) was one of a series of clashes between French and Chinese forces in Tonkin (northern Vietnam) in the period. The campaign, which lasted from 6 to 24 March, resulted in the French capture of B·∫Øc Ninh and the complete defeat of China's Guangxi Army. China, the traditional overlord of Vietnam, kept contesting French influence in the area and was supporting Annam as well as the Black Flags on its territory at the frontier with Tonkin. Although a treaty had been signed between France and China (11 May 1884 the Tientsin Accord) promising Chinese evacuation from Tonkin, military confrontations continued as in the B·∫Øc L·ªá ambush (June 1884). These tensions led to the Sino-French War (1884‚Äì85), which ultimately forced China to totally disengage from Vietnam and confirmed the French possessions. French Indochina (1887-1954) Native priests of the Paris Foreign Missions Society, in western Tonkin. French Indochina was officially formed in October 1887 from Annam, Tonkin, Cochinchina (which together form modern Vietnam) and the Kingdom of Cambodia following the Sino-French war (1884‚Äì1885). Jean Antoine Ernest Constans became the first Governor-General of French Indochina on 16 November 1887. Laos was added after the Franco-Siamese War of 1893. The federation lasted until 1954. In the four protectorates, the French formally left the local rulers in power, who were the Emperors of Vietnam, Kings of Cambodia, and Kings of Luang Prabang, but in fact gathered all powers in their hands, the local rulers acting only as heads. France stayed in Indochina during World War II, tolerated by the Japanese Army NAMBA, Chizuru, Fran√ßais et Japonais en Indochine (1940-1945), colonisation, propagande et rivalit√© culturelle, √âd. Karthala, Paris, 2012. Indochina war and Vietnamese independence (1954) French Union paratroops dropping from a \\"Flying Boxcar\\" during the Battle of Dien Bien Phu. Vietnam obtained independence following the First Indochina War. In 1945, H·ªì Ch√≠ Minh declared an independent Democratic Republic of Vietnam, which was recognized by the fellow Communist governments of China and the Soviet Union. Fighting lasted until March 1954, when the Vi·ªát Minh won the decisive victory against French forces at the grueling Battle of ƒêi·ªán Bi√™n Ph·ªß. This led to the partition of Vietnam into the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in the north, under Vi·ªát Minh control, and the State of Vietnam in the south, which had the support of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France. It was at the 1954 Geneva Conference that France relinquished any claim to territory in the Indochinese peninsula. Laos and Cambodia also became independent in 1954, but were both drawn into the Vietnam War. The events of 1954 marked the end of French involvement in the region, and the beginnings of serious U.S. commitment. Tensions between North and South Vietnam led to the Vietnam War. Post war relations (1973-present) France recognized North Vietnam and established diplomatic relations on April 12, 1973.B√ºhler, [url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ty7NAG1Jl-8C&pg;=PA76], p.76 In 1990, Fran√ßois Mitterrand became the first French President to visit Vietnam in order to increase cooperation between France and its former colony. Since then, France has continued to maintain close relations with Vietnam, due to the historical connections between the two nations and Vietnam's presence in the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie.

It is a Grade II* listed building surrounded by 8 acres of landscaped gardens. The Manor of Ansty was owned by the Stanhope family from 1406. It was sold in 1506 to the Earl of Shrewsbury who donated it to the Dean of St George's, Windsor. It was let out on lease until 1659 when it was purchased by Richard Tayler. The old manor was replaced by Edward Tayler in 1678 with a seven-bayed, two-storey mansion. On the death of a later Edward Tayler in 1799, the property passed to his nephew Simon Adams, a barrister and Recorder of Daventry. In 1800 Adams remodeled the house adding a third storey to the main block, with a pediment over the central three bays, and two one-bayed wings, so creating a Carolean style entrance front. Later extensions were added to the south east in the mid- and late 19th century. Henry Cadwallader Adams (1779-1842) was Mayor of Coventry in 1836 and High Sheriff of Warwickshire in 1837. His nephew and namesake Henry Cadwallader Adams (1817-1899) was a children's writer. Descendants of the Adams family remained in residence until 1965.

There are several purpose-built crypts/catacombs, including those of the West Norwood Cemetery, which has a remarkable collection of historic monuments on a landscaped hill. The catacombs, opened in 1837, were built below chapels and included a group of 95 vaults with private and shared loculi with a capacity of 3500 coffins. Another large catacomb was built at Kensal Green Cemetery and a smaller one at Nunhead Cemetery. Several other cemeteries were given aboveground burial structures which they described as catacombs, including Brompton Cemetery and Highgate Cemetery. The Camden catacombs are an extensive range of passages largely underneath what later became the Camden markets, constructed in the 19th century, which were originally used as stables for horses and pit ponies working on the railways.

Its hospitals are also major teaching centres and offer training for nurses, doctors and other health care professionals in partnership with City, University of London, Kings College London, London South Bank University and UCL Medical School. History Origins The hospitals which now form part of UCLH or which contributed to its development were all originally established as charities which relied on public donations and subscriptions for their income. The oldest of these was the Middlesex Hospital, which was founded in 1745 and was one of the five voluntary general hospitals which were established in London during the 18th century (the others being Westminster Hospital (1719), Guy's Hospital (1721), St George's Hospital (1733), and the Royal London Hospital (1740). 20th century In 1948 the National Health Service was established, making most hospitals in the UK directly controlled by the public sector and funded by public taxation. Hospitals were grouped together into regional hospital management committees or teaching hospital groups. Following major NHS reforms UCL Hospitals NHS Trust was established in 1994, comprising the Middlesex Hospital, the Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Hospital, the Hospital for Tropical Diseases and University College Hospital. In 1996 The Eastman Dental Hospital and the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery joined the UCLH NHS Trust. 2000 to 2010 In August 2001 the private Heart Hospital was acquired by UCLH and became the new home for all of the Trust's cardiac services, which had previously been housed in the Middlesex Hospital. In 2002 the Royal London Homeopathic Hospital joined UCLH and in July 2004 UCLH was one of the first NHS trusts to be granted foundation trust status. In 2005 the new University College Hospital building was opened and all activities from the Middlesex Hospital were moved into the new building. The Middlesex Hospital was closed in December 2005 and the site sold to developers. In November 2009 the University College Hospital Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Wing was opened and most activities from the Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Hospital were moved into the new building. In April 2007 the Trust formed the UCLH/UCL National Institute for Health Research Comprehensive Biomedical Research Centre in partnership with UCL and the National Institute for Health Research. In August 2008 the Trust announced its intention to form the UCL Partners academic health science centre with UCL, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Trust, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and Royal Free Hampstead NHS Trust. In February 2009 Professor Sir Cyril Chantler was appointed as the first Chair of UCL Partners and it was officially designated as an academic health science centre by the UK Department of Health in March 2009. 2010 to present In April 2012 it was announced that UCLH had been selected by the UK Government as one of two sites in England for the provision of Proton Beam Therapy (PBT) (the other being the Christie Hospital in Manchester). In 2015 the Trust began construction of a new clinical facility adjacent to University College Hospital to house the PBT facilities, and to also contain Europe‚Äôs largest haematological inpatient service and a short stay surgical centre. The facility is planned to open in 2019. The Trust opened the UCH Macmillan Cancer Centre in April 2012.

The Heart Hospital was renamed University College Hospital at Westmoreland Street and refurbished to provide thoracic and urology services including operation theaters, lithotripsy and cystoscopy. In August 2016 a partnership between the trust and Google's artificial intelligence division, DeepMind, was announced, as part of which anonymised CT and MRI scans from former University College Hospital radiotherapy patients will be utilised to help develop an algorithm that can automatically differentiate between healthy and cancerous tissues. In October 2019 services from the Eastman Dental Hospital and the Royal National Throat Nose and Ear Hospital moved to a new facility, the Royal National ENT and Eastman Dental Hospitals on Huntley Street, WC1E 6DG.

Privatised in 1995, it has continued to exist in the post-1989 conditions of market economy. Balkantourist was founded as a self-supporting enterprise, part of the Ministry of Railways, during the government of Georgi Dimitrov. With a starting capital of 300 million leva, its initial service was to compensate Czechoslovakia's enterprises in Bulgaria that were nationalized after the Bulgarian coup d'√©tat of 1944 by offering holidays on the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast to Czechoslovakian citizens. As the war reparations imposed on Bulgaria after World War II made the country unable to compensate Czechoslovakia financially, Czechoslovakian leader Klement Gottwald suggested the idea. In the following decades, Balkantourist gradually expanded its business to include mountain and cultural tourism in Bulgaria, as well as service tourists from other countries of the Eastern Bloc besides Czechoslovakia: the Soviet Union, East Germany, Poland, Hungary, Romania. Balkantourist played a major role in the establishment of planned seaside resorts such as Golden Sands and Sunny Beach, and Bulgaria's policy of international tourism as a profitable branch inspired other socialist countries such as Yugoslavia and Romania to develop their own seaside resorts. After the democratic changes in 1989, Balkantourist was privatised in 1995 by the Bulgarian Tourist Holding. As of 2008, it offers holidays in Bulgaria and in more than 35 destinations abroad. The company owns Grand Hotel Varna, the Lebed, Rubin, Delfin, Delfin Marina, Paradise Beach and International hotels on the Black Sea coast, Hotel Rila in Borovets, Arbanasi Palace and Grand Hotel Bulgaria in Sofia.

During this time he carried out extensive research in subjects such as the properties of weak rocks, stiff clays, residual and other structured soils. He was an internationally recognised expert in the design and deterioration of earthworks and fills, embankment dams and natural or man-made slopes. His expertise also included seepage, residual strength and pore pressure measurement and its interpretation. His academic post at Imperial included supervising more than twenty PhD programmes and publishing some 80 papers on technical subjects. He was also an acclaimed and amusing lecturer, having given numerous lectures to international conferences and the Rankine Lecture to the British Geotechnical Association in 1994. An example of his style is given in an article published in the Guardian on Wednesday 1 February 2006: \\"Much seems to depend on words; many people seem to think \\"reservoir\\" a rather unpleasant one, and Hattersley admits that he was one. My advice to any reservoir promoter is never say \\"reservoir\\", say \\"lake\\". Even better, say \\"wetland habitat\\". Better still, promote it as a leisure amenity. (\\"There will be bird watching, cycling, fishing, picnicking, sailing and walking and you can get it all for free if we sometimes sell some of the water to the local water undertaking.\\") If all else fails, ask for some extra land beside it, cut the grass short, plant 18 little flags and call it a \\"lateral water hazard\\".\\" Peter Vaughan was an active consultant throughout his career. One of the founding members of Geotechnical Consulting Group he gave specialist advice to consulting firms, contractors, utilities and public authorities on a wide range of problems, such as the reconstruction of Carsington Dam after its failure during construction, and Roadford Dam, where he was a member of the Advisory Panel. He was involved with a review of dam performance for Ardleigh Dam, Essex, a safety review for Mica Dam, Canada, and the rehabilitation of the three dams of the Cascade of Dauga in Latvia for which he was a member of the Advisory Panel. He was involved extensively with the rehabilitation of old clay embankments for London Underground Limited. He travelled widely on both consultancy work and giving lectures to international engineering bodies. His spare time was taken up with fly fishing and enjoying fine wines, good food and better company. A very generous associate, colleague or friend, he never married and he died of a heart attack at his home in Suffolk on 16 May 2008.

Early Life & Background Mohamed Hassan was born on April 1, 1953 in Mogadishu during it's period as a United Nations Trust Territory. He had a modest upbringing and was raised by his parents alongside his ten siblings. He hails from the Abgaal Hawiye clan. He joined the Somali Air Force in the early seventies where he quickly made a name for himself as an exceptional and talented young pilot. He eventually attained the rank of Lieutenant colonel. Somali Civil War On July 12 1988, during the early months of the Somali Civil War, he received orders to bomb Hargeisa, then the second largest city in the former Somali Democratic Republic military dictatorship. As an officer in the Somali Air Force, he took an oath to defend his nation and its people and could not bring himself to bomb and kill innocent civilians. He refused to obey his orders and switched off his radio. He flew his Mig-17 fighter aircraft to the nearby country of Djibouti where he was forced to make an emergency landing on a beach due to fuel shortage. He abandoned his jet and attempted to make his way to the capital by walking in the scorching heat. After walking some distance, he came across some fishermen near the coast who helped him reach the capital. The Somali government requested his repatriation, however the Djibouti government refused and he was informed by the Djibouti Home Affairs Minister that due to his actions, he will be granted political asylum. Later Life Mohamed Hassan moved to Europe in 1990, where he settled in Luxembourg with his wife and children. In 2008 he returned to Hargeisa, where he was invited to attend a ceremony held to honour his exceptional heroism, integrity and nobility. He was the guest of honour at that year's 26 June celebrations. A humble man, He mentioned in a 2009 interview with BBC Somali that it was his duty as a human being to save the lives of defenceless and innocent people, adding that he refused to be a vessel for destruction and that it is only other people who make his actions seem heroic.

Euromoney magazine, April 2007 Actis was formed in July 2004, as a spinout of CDC Group plc (formerly the Commonwealth Development Corporation), an organization established by the UK Government in 1948 to invest in developing economies in Africa, Asia, and the Caribbean. The Actis management team acquired majority ownership of CDC's emerging markets investment platform. History Actis was founded in 2004 as a spinout from CDC Group, the UK's development finance institution, when a 60% stake in the firm was sold to CDC managers and staff for a total consideration of ¬£373,000. The new company was given a five-year 'umbrella' guarantee that it would continue to manage all CDC's existing overseas investments totalling US$900 million in CDC funds. According to the UK's Department for International Development, the price was agreed after a valuation by financial advisers KPMG. Under the 2004 deal that created Actis, if the company was to be sold on the open market within 10 years, 80% of the profits and proceeds would go back to the government. In 2007, UK prime minister Gordon Brown came under attack over the sell-off of Actis after it became apparent that the formerly government-owned business had made millions of pounds for its former employees.MPs blast 'incompetent' Brown over company sell-off. The Observer, 25 November 2007 On 1 May 2012 the Secretary of State for International Development, Andrew Mitchell, announced that the state's remaining 40% stake had been sold to Actis management for an initial ¬£8m. The deal also included a share of future profits that could be worth over ¬£62m to the UK Government.UK sells share in emerging markets private equity group Actis. The Guardian, 2 May 2012 In August 2013, Actis acquired the South African firm Transaction Capital‚Äôs payment services unit, Paycorp, for US$95 million. In October 2013, the firm announced it had invested US$48 million in the Indian pharmaceuticals company Symbiotec Pharmalab for a \\"significant stake\\". In March 2019, Actis was named \\"Impact Investment Firm of the Year\\" at the 2018 Private Equity International Awards. The firm also placed second in the Energy Private Equity category, behind I Squared Capital. In April 2019, driven by an industry-wide trend towards more transparency in impact investing, the firm launched the \\"Actis Impact Score\\", an open-source framework that seeks to consistently measure impact from investment to investment, thus permitting comparison across different asset classes or geographies, as well as tracking its evolution over the holding period. In mid 2018, following the crisis and subsequent collapse of The Abraaj Group, Actis moved to acquire and assume management of Abraaj's Middle East and North Africa funds. While other players were interested and placed competing bids, including higher offers from firms based in the Persian Gulf, Actis was ultimately preferred by investors to take over the funds due to its emerging-markets expertise and operations-focused investment rationale, as well as in interest of a block deal that encompassed all underlying assets. In July 2019, after a complex, multiyear process, it was announced that Actis had secured management rights to Abraaj Private Equity Fund IV and Abraaj Africa Fund III, totaling $2.99 billion of assets under management and 14 portfolio companies. The transaction also included around 25 junior employees formerly employed by Abraaj. Commenting on the deal, Actis' Chief Investment Officer stated it was a response after \\"a number of investors asked us to step in to be part of a solution in mid-2018\\".

A condition once common in draft horses, it is characterized by inflammation of the cartilage of the lower leg. There are two forms, subcutaneous and cartilaginous. Quittor usually results from an injury to the leg, such as an abscess on the coronary band above the hoof, that allows foreign matter to get into the leg and then collect beneath the hoof, leading to an infection. In some cases, removing this matter requires cutting away parts of the hoof. Abscesses may also form inside the hoof capsule itself from improper shoeing and trimming of the hoof, from laminitis, or from injury to the sole of the hoof, but the horse will be significantly lame for a longer period of time if the infection migrates up to the coronary band rather than down. Treatment of hoof and coronary band abscesses today usually incorporates use of antibiotics, sometimes combined with poulticing. Because use of draft horses has declined significantly, it is rarely encountered today. In the 1890 International Cyclopedia, it was described as \\"a fistulous wound about the top of a horse's foot, and results from treads, pricks, or neglected corns, which lead to the formation of matter underneath the hoof. Any dead horn, matter, or other cause of irritation must be sought for by cutting away the hoof. A free opening must be provided for the egress of any pent-up matter. Poulticing for a few days is often useful; while healing may afterward be expedited by the injection of any mild astringent lotion.\\" References *EquiMed entry on Quittor *Merck Veterinary Manual entry on Quittor *George Fleming, The Practical Horse Keeper (1897) *This article incorporates text from the International Cyclopedia of 1890, a publication now in the public domain.

Additionally, one or two upper chest pockets, with or without flaps, may have been worn. It had provision for shoulder boards (epaulettes or shoulder straps) and sometimes reinforced elbows and cuffs. The Tsarist version had the standing collar while the M35 version had a stand-and-fall collar which was replaced with the standing collar in the M43 version. The Soviet Army M35 version usually had hidden buttons. A double breasted version (kitel) for officers of all ranks existed during the Tsarist period. Origins The Guards' Rifle Battalion on parade in white gymnastyorka shirt-tunics April 1905. The gymnastyorka was originally introduced into the Imperial Russian Army in about 1870 for wear by regiments stationed in Turkestan during the hot summers.Boris Mollo, page 137 \\"Uniforms of the Imperial Russian Army\\", It took the form of a loose fitting white linen \\"shirt-tunic\\" and included the coloured shoulder-boards of the dark green tunic worn during the remainder of the year. The gymnastyorka was taken into use by all branches of the Imperial Russian Army at the time of the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78. Originally intended as a working dress during peacetime and patterned on the traditional Russian peasant smock, the gymnastyorka was subsequently adopted for ordinary duties and active service wear. It was worn as such by non-commissioned ranks in summer during the 1890s and early 1900s. The officers' equivalent was a white double breasted tunic or kitel.A. Ivanov and P. Jowett, pages 22 and 43 \\"The Russo-Japanese War 1904-05\\", During the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-05 the white gymnastyorka with its red or blue shoulder-boards proved too conspicuous against modern weaponry and the garments were often dyed various shades of khaki.A. Ivanov and P. Jowett, page 19 \\"The Russo-Japanese War 1904-05\\", The smartness and comfort of the white gymnastyorka enabled it to survive for a few more years of peacetime wear until a light khaki version was adopted in 1907-09 and worn during World War I. Red Army soldier wearing a Budenovka and a Russian Civil War era pattern gymnastyorka with three razgovory straps sown across the chest. Post-Revolution After the Russian Revolution of 1917, a new version of the gymnastyorka with a stand-and-fall collar was issued to the Bolshevik forces, with three razgovory straps sown across the chest in branch colours.Mikhail Khovostov, page 46 \\"The Russian Civil War - the Red Army\\", During the Russian Civil War, both the counter-revolutionary White Army and the Bolshevik Red Army wore gymnastyorkas, White Army troops were issued with new black gymnastyorkas of the original Imperial pattern, some of them wore old khaki-green or white ones, but all of them had shoulder-boards. The Bolshevik Red Army wore both original Imperial pattern shirt-tunics and ones of a new model, with or without the coloured stripes, but some added with two breast pockets. The wide variety of uniforms worn by both sides during the Civil War arose from supply and production difficulties in the chaotic conditions of the time. In 1924 the shoulder straps were abolished, and in 1935 the gymnastyorka was modified to accommodate the reintroduction of personal ranks in the Red Army. The M35 version was slightly modified on 1 August 1941 after the experience of the Winter War, replacing the colorful rank collar tabs, with duller and subdued ones. In 1943 the traditional Tsarist version with stand collar and shoulder-boards was reintroduced, replacing the M35 gymnastyorka. The M43 remained in service until the gymnastyorka was finally abolished in 1969. Other users The gymnastyorka was also adopted by several Soviet satellite states such as Bulgaria, Mongolia, Albania, and North Korea. Enlisted soldiers in the North Korean Army continue to wear the gymnastyorka as part of their field uniform. The Tsarist police also wore the white gymnastyorka as a summer garment until 1917. Their successors, the Soviet Militsiya, continued to wear this traditional garment until the 1950s.

It is a Grade I listed building. History The Pierrepont family have lived at Holme Pierrepont since around 1280, following the marriage of Henry de Pierrepont to Annora de Manvers. Originally the area was known only as Holme, but later adopted the family surname as a suffix. The hall was built by Sir William Pierrepont around 1500. He was succeeded by Sir George Pierrepont (died 1564), Sir Henry Pierrepont (died 1616) and Sir Robert Pierrepont (died 1643), who was created 1st Earl of Kingston-upon-Hull. The north range of the house was rebuilt by the 1st Earl in 1628. His son Henry Pierrepont, 2nd Earl of Kingston-upon-Hull was created Marquess of Dorchester in 1645. The family rose to be Dukes of Kingston in 1715 when the 5th Earl was created 1st Duke of Kingston-upon-Hull. By this time their principal seat was Thoresby Hall in the dukeries area on the other side of Nottingham, which the family had bought in 1633. Holme Pierrepont became a secondary house and was reduced in size. The 1st Earl's north range was demolished around 1730. After the Dukedom died out when the 2nd Duke died childless in 1773, the estate passed in 1788 to his nephew Charles Medows, a naval officer. Charles changed his surname to Pierrepont and was created 1st Earl Manvers in 1806. The 3rd Earl rebuilt the North Wing around 1870 and was succeeded by the 4th Earl. The Hall was requisitioned for military purposes in both World Wars and left unoccupied between them. During the Second War, it was used as a base for training young soldiers of the 70th (YS) Sherwood Foresters after which it was reoccupied by Lady Sibell Argles, sister of the 5th Earl. After her death in 1968, it was sold to her cousin Mrs Elizabeth Brackenbury, who with her husband Robin carried out a program of renovation, including in 1975 the removal of the exterior stucco to reveal the original brickwork. Their son Robert Brackenbury also lives in a separate quarters in the house with his wife Charlotte. The house is set in of parkland. Current use Holme Pierrepont is regularly open to the public on a few days in February and March each year. All house opening details can be found on the website. The house is also now a luxury function venue, available for weddings and corporate events, and is used for filming and photo shoots. Adjacent to the house is St. Edmund's Church, Holme Pierrepont.

It is situated about 5 km south of the centre of Carletonville and 80 km westwards from Johannesburg. History of the village The name of the village is of Dutch origin meaning \\"happy prospect\\". The farm Blyvooruitzicht was first farmed by Pieter Dani√´l Roux and the main road through the current village is named after him. Established in 1937, Blyvooruitzicht village was built to house the workers of the Blyvooruitzicht Gold Mine which was the first to mine the gold of the West Wits line. In the late 60's and early 70's it boasted having the highest earnings per capita in the world. History of the mine Production started in 1942 under the ownership of Rand Mines. Later ownership passed to DRD (in 1997), then Village Main Reef and more recently Blyvoor Gold, a company run by Peter Skeat and Richard Floyd. Sinkholes During the night of 3 August 1964, a sinkhole in the former mining village township of Westdene, Blyvooruitzight, buried the entire Oosthuizen family and their domestic worker, alive. Situated some 5¬Ωkm south of Carletonville, as one of four village townships at the Blyvooruitzight Gold Mine, Westdene, was consequently abandoned. The subsequent housing shortage was quickly normalised by extending the Southdene village township situated some 400 meters south of the sinkhole, with pre-fabricated asbestos housing. Unknown at the time, asbestos was since proclaimed and banned as a health hazard, but the houses are still occupied today. An ancient sinkhole southwest of the village called the Hutgrot Cave was the shelter of the Batswana tribes during the Mzilikazi raids. Places of interest The Villagers Blyvoor mine and village was the setting for a SABC TV soap opera filmed in the 1970s called \\"The Villagers (TV Series 1976)\\". Isidingo The highest point in the village is a hill called \\"Isidingo\\", which is where the mine manager's house was built. The current soap opera \\"Isidingo\\" derives its name from it. Mining Operations Gold Blyvooruitzicht Gold Mining Company Limited (Blyvoor), has underground and surface operations and is situated on the north-western edge of the Witwatersrand Basin. Established in 1937, it was the first mine on the West Wits line. Production started here in 1942. Blyvoor has two main gold- bearing horizons: the Carbon Leader Reef (CLR), which is one of the principal ore bodies of the Carletonville goldfield; and the Middelvlei Reef, which is some 75 metres above the CLR horizon. At present mining is concentrated on No 5 shaft. Uranium A pilot uranium extraction plant was put in operation at Blyvooruitzicht in October 1949 and by 1953 uranium production was done at large scale. Tailings from the slime dams created by gold mining operations were later reprocessed for both gold and uranium extraction.

The term 'comprehensive' was current at that time and the curriculum of the school combined what were formally regarded as the 'secondary' subjects with the 'technical' subjects. This was seen as giving a broad range of subjects under which pupils with very varying degrees of aptitude, ability and skills could prosper. Sport Gaelic football is the most popular sport within the school and it competes in the All-Ireland Vocational Schools Championship. In 1992 the school were runners-up in the All-Ireland Senior Vocational School Championship and in 1998 it won the All- Ireland Junior Vocational School Championship.

Post-war she served in the Pacific Ocean theatre of operations for some time with the US Army as USAT Herkimer, and then as USNS Herkimer (T-AK-188), with the Military Sea Transportation Service (MSTS) from 1950 to 1973. She was then transferred to the navy of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands (TTPI). Construction Herkimer was laid down under U.S. Maritime Commission contract, MC hull 2119, by Walter Butler Shipbuilders, Inc., Superior, Wisconsin, 10 April 1944; launched 2 July 1944; sponsored by Miss Ann Farley; acquired by the Navy 25 June 1945 ; and commissioned at New Orleans, Louisiana, 14 July 1945, Lieutenant Carlton W. Crocker, Jr., in command. Service history World War II-related service After shakedown in the Gulf of Mexico, Herkimer loaded cargo at Gulfport, Mississippi, then departed 22 August for the Western Pacific Ocean. She reached Subic Bay, Luzon, 7 October; unloaded refrigerated cargo; and sailed the 13th carrying US Army equipment for occupation forces stationed in Japan. She arrived Sasebo, Japan, 20 October and operated there until 30 December when she departed for Yokosuka. Following her arrival 2 January 1946, she was stripped of Navy gear. She then steamed to Yokohama 16 January, decommissioned 1 February, and transferred to the US Army. US Army service Herkimer was operated by a Japanese merchant crew for the Supreme Commander of Allied Forces in Japan until 1 July 1950 when she was reacquired by the US Navy. After refitting, she was assigned to the MSTS 28 February 1951, and designated T-AK 188. Korean War support Manned by a civilian crew, she participated in the Korean supply run from Japan supporting the repulse of Communist aggression in South Korea. Operating out of Moji, Kure, and Yokohama, she transported vital military cargo to American-held South Korean ports during the remainder of the conflict. Following the 1953 Armistice in Korea, Herkimer continued supply runs between Japan and South Korea. In response to the scheduled transfer of North Vietnam to Communist control, she departed Yokohama 6 November 1954 to provide support for Operation Passage to Freedom. She reached Haiphong, North Vietnam, 15 November; and during the next 2 months she transported cargo southward to St. Jacques and Saigon. After completing three runs to South Vietnamese ports, she departed Saigon 23 January 1955 and arrived Kobe, Japan, 1 February. Resuming cargo runs out of Japanese ports, Herkimer remained in the Western Pacific since 1955. Cargo operations have sent her primarily to Inchon, Pusan, and other South Korean ports; and she has made numerous cargo runs along the Japanese coast from Wakkanai and Hakodate, Hokkaido, to Kagoshima and Nagasaki, Ky≈´sh≈´. In addition she has steamed from Korea to Southeast Asia while supporting America's determination to maintain peace and contain Communism in the Far East. She has steamed from ports in Japan and the Philippine Islands, transporting military supplies to Formosa between 1961 and 1965. Vietnam War In response to American efforts to support South Vietnam, she resumed intermittent cargo runs to South Vietnam in February 1962. She remained in the Western Pacific, serving the forces of freedom in the Far East as a veteran carrier of vital military cargo. Final dispositioning Herkimer continued to support MSTS operations in the Pacific theatre until 15 July 1973 when she was placed out of service and struck from the Navy List. Merchant service She was then loaned, 15 July 1973, to the Department of the Interior (DOI) for use in the TTPI.

It has many of the qualities of a fairy tale. Only one complete manuscript exists from the twelfth century (Heidelberg Cpg 390). The tale was popular into the fourteenth century.Gibbs, p. 106 The name Rother may have a connection to a king of the Lombards, Rothari. There is a possibility, however, the name Rother may have come from the Norman king, Roger II of Sicily. The epic story is notable for its combination of Byzantine and Germanic story elements. The poem has between 5200 and 5300 lines of verse and is from the period of Middle High German literature of adventure novels. The epic tale is written in a mixture of Low and High German. It seems to be for a Bavarian audience and was perhaps written by a Bavarian priest. The reason for this is because the writer mentions two noble Bavarian families, the Tengelingen and the Diessen.Gibbs, p. 107 The medieval German romance tale was popular among wandering minstrels of central Europe and was written in popular verse style. Some historians believe King Rother was written by an unknown educated cleric Rhenish poet probably between 1140 and 1170. Others suggest it was a Bavarian priest (c.1150); few believe any longer that it was a minstrel. The author refers to \\"books\\" as his source indicating there was a written source already, however he could have just used this to authenticate his writings. The epic The epic recounts King Rother's adventurous quest to the Middle East for a bride. The King on the advice of his nobles is concerned about the royal succession. He acts on their advice to seek the hand of the beautiful daughter of King Constantine of Constantinople. The problem with this however, is that all previous suitors lost their lives in the process. King Rother plays it safe and sends twelve envoys to King Constantine for his daughter's hand in marriage. He sent twelve counts escorted by twelve knights in shiny armor with much treasure. They made an excellent impression, especially on the Queen. However, when King Rother's trusted count announces their purpose King Constantine refuses the hand of the royal princess. Not only that, he captures all of King Rother's men and throws them in jail. He also takes all the treasure. A year passes and King Rother is concerned about his men and treasure. He doesn't dare approach King Constantine with an army because surely he would then kill his men. Instead he comes up with a ruse and disguises himself as \\"Dietrich\\", a refugee who claims that he has been forced out of King Rother's land. Dietrich (King Rother) is generous with gifts and eventually obtains an army of five thousand men. The Queen of Constantinople is especially impressed with Dietrich. She gives her opinion to her husband King Constantine that King Rother must be a powerful king if he threw out a man of such qualities off his land. She felt that the royal princess should have been given to Rother. The princess's curiosity got the best of her and she arranged a secret rendezvous with Dietrich. Dietrich then reveals to her he is really King Rother and desires her hand in marriage. They then planned secretly among themselves to get Rother's messengers released from jail. Dietrich promises on his life to King Constantine that the men will not leave the city. After the men are released Dietrich reveals to everyone that he is really King Rother by playing a certain melody on his harp. Then news comes that the evil King Ymelot is coming to attack King Constantine. Dietrich offers to help the king and the two armies camp on the outskirts of the city. At night Dietrich sneaks into the camp of the enemy and captures King Ymelot. He is turned over to King Constantine as a prisoner at his camp. There is much rejoicing of the defeat of the enemy. In the turmoil and excitement King Rother quickly returns to Constantinople and announces that King Constantine has been killed. The ladies of Constantinople asks King Rother for help. He has them brought to his ship. In the process of embarking however, he only actually takes the royal princess on board. He leaves a message to the Queen his true identity and that the story of King Constantine's demise was only a ruse to get the princess. King Rother sails off with the princess. The Queen is quite happy at the outcome, however her husband King Constantine is furious. To make matters worse for King Constantine it turns out King Ymelot escapes from the prison.Gibbs, p. 108 King Rother returns to his country of Bari and finds the need to take inventory of his lands. He travels to the north part of his country to start the inventory. While he is gone an unscrupulous minstrel sent by King Constantine arrives in Bari. He uses a ploy and tricks the royal princess onto his ship and takes her back to Constantinople. When King Rother returns from his inventory he is enraged. He gathers together 30,000 men and sails off to Constantinople. Once King Rother arrives near the city he hides in the woods with his men. The king and a few of his men secretly enter the city disguised as pilgrims. There they learn that the evil King Ymelot has not only captured King Constantine, but his daughter as well. The princess is to be married off to King Ymelot's son that evening. King Rother and his \\"pilgrim\\" men sneak into the banquet hall and hide under the table where the princess is. King Rother secretly slips her a silver ring. She is so excited about this that she gives it away to everyone that King Rother must be nearby. Since the jig was up, King Rother reveals himself at the mercy of God. King Rother is given a choice of how he would like to be executed. He persuades King Ymelot that he wishes to die in the woods (where his army is hidden out!). King Rother insists that all 30 of the evil kings be present at his execution. They agree to this great opportunity to see him murdered. Meanwhile, back at the city the five thousand men that Dietrich (\\"King Rother\\") helped previously armed themselves to free him. While the hanging gallows were being constructed these men attacked and freed King Rother and his two companions. The companions were two giants, Asprian and Witold, that King Rother brought with him. King Rother then blew his horn which was a signal. Then all his army hidden in the woods came out and they, along with King Rother's special giants, slaughtered the evil kings. The city of Constantinople and King Constantine are spared the onslaught. King Constantine brings out his princess and the other ladies of the city to meet King Rother. The Queen accused her husband of arrogance and gives the princess back to King Rother. The king then returns with his new bride to Bari, where she gives birth to a son, Pipin. Pipin later becomes the father to Charlemagne.

Agriculture in Portugal is based on small to medium-sized family-owned dispersed units; however, the sector also includes larger-scale intensive farming export-oriented agrobusinesses backed by companies (like Grupo RAR's Vitacress, Sovena, Lactogal, Vale da Rosa, Companhia das Lez√≠rias and Valouro). The extent of cooperative organisation has been reaching a greater importance with globalization. Portugal produces a wide variety of products, including green vegetables, rice, corn, wheat, barley, olives, oilseeds, nuts, cherries, bilberry, table grapes and edible mushrooms. Forestry has also played an important economic role among the rural communities and industry (namely the paper industry that includes Portucel Soporcel Group, the engineered wood industry that includes Sonae Ind√∫stria, and the furniture industry that includes several manufacturing plants in and around Pa√ßos de Ferreira, the core of Portugal's major industrial operations of IKEA). In 2013, the gross agricultural product accounted for 2.4% of the GDP. Portugal is one of the world's largest producers of wine and cork. The land area of slightly more than 9.2 million hectares was classified as follows (in thousands of hectares): 2,755 arable land and permanent crops (including 710 in permanent crops), 530 permanent pasture, 3,640 forest and woodland, and 2,270 other land. History Most of Portugal's farms have a small area devoted to a diversified intensive farming, like these in the Oeste Subregion. Agriculture, forestry, and fishing employed 17.8 percent of Portugal's labor force but accounted for only 6.2 percent of GDP in 1990. With the principal exception of the alluvial soils of the Tagus River valley and the irrigated sections of the Alentejo, crop yields and animal productivity remained well below those of the other European Community (EC) members. Portugal's agro-food deficit (attributable mainly to grain, oilseed, and meat imports) represented about 2.5 percent of GDP, but its surplus on forestry products (wood, cork, and paper pulp) offset its food deficit. Portugal's overall agricultural performance was unfavorable when viewed in the context of the country's natural resources and climatic conditions. Agricultural productivity (gross farm output per person employed) was well below that of the other West European countries in 1985, at half of the levels in Greece and Spain and a quarter of the EC average. The region of Alentejo is known as the \\"breadbasket of Portugal\\" due to its extensive farming and cereal production. A number of factors contributed to Portugal's poor agricultural performance. First, the level of investment in agriculture was traditionally very low. The number of tractors and the quantity of fertilizer used per unit area was one-third the European Community average in the mid-1980s. Second, farms in the north were small and fragmented; half of them were less than one hectare in size, and 86 percent less than five hectares. Third, the collective farms set up in the south after the 1974‚Äì75 expropriations due to the leftist military coup of 25 April 1974, proved incapable of modernizing, and their efficiency declined. Fourth, poor productivity was associated with the low level of education of farmers. Finally, distribution channels and economic infrastructure were inadequate in parts of the country. According to government estimates, about 9,000 km2 (2,200,000 acres) of agricultural land were occupied between April 1974 and December 1975 in the name of land reform; about 32% of the occupations were ruled illegal. In January 1976, the government pledged to restore the illegally occupied land to its owners, and in 1977, it promulgated the Land Reform Review Law. Restoration of illegally occupied land began in 1978. Portuguese wines include the famous Port wine which is produced from vineyards of the Douro Valley in northern Portugal. Following its adhesion in 1986 to the European Economic Community (EEC), now the European Union (EU), Portugal's agriculture, like in other EU member states, has been heavily shaped by the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). With the reform of CAP, a significant reduction in the number of producers through consolidation (especially in the Norte and Centro regions) resulted in the end of traditional, subsistence-like based agriculture. In 1998, 28% of the land was considered arable. Of the 26,000 km2 (7 million acres), 74% was cultivated with seasonal crops and 26% was under permanent crops. In 2001, the gross agricultural product accounted for 4% of GDP. In 1999, Portugal produced 949,117 tons of potatoes (389,800 tons in 2012); 1,151,526 tons of tomatoes (1,392,700 tons in 2012); 15,766 tons of sweet potatoes (20,000 tons in 2012); 373,131 tons of wheat (59,000 tons in 2012); 333,000 tons of olives (627,000 tons in 2013); 151,650 tons of rice (184,100 tons in 2012); 215,337 tons of oranges (183,400 tons in 2012). Wine, particularly Port and Madeira from the Douro region and the Madeira islands, is an important agricultural export; production totaled 679,000 tons in 1999, down from 1,137,000 tons in 1990. Portugal, as of 2013, is the world's tenth-largest producer of wine, although Portugal's wines are mostly unknown internationally apart from Port and Ros√©. Under the influence of EU policies, vineyard areas have been reduced in recent years. In 2012, the food deficit (food imports minus food exports) was of ‚Ç¨3.33 billion.  Major agricultural products  Portugal's climatic and topographic conditions allow for a large number of crops, including olives, figs, citrus, mushrooms, sunflower, tomatoes, cereals, bananas (in Madeira Island) and pineapple (in S√£o Miguel Island). Wine, table grapes, leaf vegetables, dairy, tomatoes for processing, rice, sugar beets, mushrooms, cork and olives are competitive. Improved marketing practices since the 1990s increased the demand for fresh horticultural and fruit products of Portuguese origin in both the domestic and export markets. In 2018, Portugal was the 9th largest world producer of olives (740 thousand tons), the 16th largest world producer of pear (162 thousand tons), the 17th largest world producer of tomatoes (1.33 million tons) and the 20th largest world producer of grape (778 thousand tons). The country also produced, in the same year, 713 thousand tons of maize, 431 thousand tons of potato, 344 thousand tons of orange, 267 thousand tons of apple, 160 thousand tons of rice, in addition to smaller yields of other agricultural products such as cabbage (137 thousand tons), onion (130 thousand tons), carrot (108 thousand tons) , wheat (67 thousand tons), melon (57 thousand tons), oats (55 thousand tons), etc.Portugal production in 2018, by FAO Beef The European Union recognises the following Portuguese Protected Designation of Origin beef brands: * Carne Alentejana, Carne Arouquesa, Carne Barros√£, Carne Cachena da Peneda, Carne da Charneca, Carne de Bovino Cruzado dos Lameiros do Barroso, Carne dos A√ßores, Carne Marinhoa, Carne Maronesa, Carne Mertolenga, Carne Mirandesa. Cheeses Portugal produces a wide variety of cheeses. There are certified cheese-producing regions, including D.O.C./Protected designation of origin (Denomina√ß√£o de Origem Controlada). These include the Castelo Branco cheese, Saloio, Santar√©m cheese, and Serra da Estrela cheese. Fruit P√™ra Rocha (pear), Cova da Beira's cherries, a number of chestnut producing regions, and the Laranja do Algarve (oranges), are examples of well-known Portuguese certified products. Portugal is the 4th world leader on tomato production, at Alentejo. In 2012, Portugal produced 116,300 tons of pears, 320,000 tons of bananas and 183,400 tons of oranges. Pork Distribution of the genus 150px Pork is also a very popular meat in Portugal. Pork meat is often served with acorns and white truffles that are commonly found in the large oak grove (genus Quercus) of the country. The Carne de Porco Alentejano has the status of Protected Designation of Origin (POD). There are many dishes with pork like the carne de porco √† alentejana and the typical leit√£o (roasted piglet). Pork made presunto, a dry-cured ham, is also typical and popular, as well as fiambre, a wet-cured ham. Wines The quality and great variety of wines in Portugal are due to noble castas, microclimates, soils and proper technology. Official designations:Platini, Estelle: Reading labels of Portugal wines * Quality Wine Produced in a Specific Region (QWPSR) or VQPRD ‚Äì Vinho de Qualidade Produzido em Regi√£o Demarcada ** These are the most protected wine and indicates a specific vineyard, such as Port Wine, Vinhos Verdes, and Alentejo Wines. These wines are labeled D.O.C. (Denomina√ß√£o de Origem Controlada) which secures a superior quality. * Wines that have more regulations placed upon them but are not in a DOC region fall under the category of Indica√ß√£o de Proveni√™ncia Regulamentada (IPR, Indication of Regulated Provenance). * Regional Wine ‚Äì Vinho Regional Carries with it a specific region within Portugal. * Table Wines ‚Äì Vinho de Mesa carries with it only the producer and the designation that it is from Portugal. Agribusiness Among the largest companies in the agricultural and agribusiness sector of Portugal are such examples as Grupo RAR (owner of Vitacress), Companhia das Lez√≠rias, Vale da Rosa, Sovena Group, Sumol + Compal, Sogrape, Derovo, Frulact, Amorim, Delta, Valouro and Lactogal. The leading Portuguese brewer Unicer, developed and supported agriculture projects for barley producers in Portugal. Its aim was the increase of Portuguese high- quality malt for use in the producing process of its beers. Unicer compra 40 mil toneladas de cevada nacional, Vida Rural (magazine), (December 3, 2008) Retail market and distribution Competitors are always well represented at Portuguese agricultural fairs and food-related shows. Other nations advertise in Portugal's food magazines and on television, and join with hotels in weekly menu promotions, complete with food products, cooks, exhibits and decorations. Competition also heats up among Portuguese and foreign firms over extremely expensive hypermarket shelf space. Suppliers fight to maintain and expand exposure of their products as the number of hypermarkets boomed since the 1990s. The struggle is getting even more intense as larger stores continue to carry more private label products, constricting shelf space even more for branded products. Modelo Continente, Jer√≥nimo Martins, Lidl and Auchan are the biggest retailers. Local manufacturers felt the squeeze on profit margins as big retailers preferred to cut costs by buying from neighboring countries. France and Spain dominate consumer-ready frozen and non-frozen food products. Spanish fruits and horticultural products are easily found all over Portugal's hypermarket and supermarket chains. The European Union, South America, the Middle East and China also compete with dried fruits, tree nuts, pulses and prepared product markets. With a land area about the size of the US state of Indiana, Portugal maintains quite a varied distribution network. The food distribution structure includes wholesalers, retailers (hypermarkets, supermarkets, cooperatives, small businesses, convenience stores), institutions and associations. Portuguese retailers generally make their purchases through a broker from the manufacturer or directly from a distributor, cash-and-carry store, traditional wholesaler or from retailer associations and cooperatives. The associations and cooperatives, made up mostly of small store owners, help members increase purchasing power, compete with larger stores and access training and trade seminars. But the role of import agents and traditional brokers declined, and retailers are becoming more adept at direct importing. Hypermarkets and supermarkets, including joint ventures between the Portuguese and French, control over 50 percent of retail food sales. The Portuguese government put the brakes on the tremendous growth of hypermarkets in an effort to protect smaller retailers. With their high buying power, the hypermarkets can be more competitive in pricing and could easily squeeze smaller businesses out of the marketplace. Organic farming Organic farming in Portugal has steadily increased in the past years. From only 73 producers in 1993, it rapidly grew to more than 1,500 in 2005. Today, more than 2,000 km2 are managed organically, which testifies to the prevailing dynamics. The farmers‚Äô sudden interest in organic agriculture clearly has to do with the financial support offered by the European Union and higher market prices. In some cases, such as the olive groves of the northern and central regions, traditional farming approximates organic farming methods, which eases conversion. With horticulture or orchards, the change is not so easy, and therefore there are not as many farmers converting. The supply is still less than the demand, reflecting the fact that organic farming is still at an initial stage. The Portuguese are growing more conscious of health and the environment, which explains the rising interest in natural foods and fibres. Their increasing purchasing power encourages this development. However, these positive factors for the expansion of organic production may not be enough to guarantee a continuous increase in the future, since several obstacles hinder the farmers‚Äô performance. In 2011, more than 220,000 hectares were managed organically while there were 5938 producers. Education, training and research in Agriculture There are several vocational and higher education institutions devoted to the teaching of agricultural sciences in Portugal. Almost all state-run polytechnic institutes (there are 15 across the country), have a school of agriculture awarding bachelor's and master's degrees in the subject. The Escola Superior Agr√°ria de Coimbra, belonging to the Polytechnical Institute of Coimbra, is the oldest polytechnic institution of agriculture. There is also a number of universities awarding bachelor's, masters' and doctorate degrees in varied agricultural science subfields. The Instituto Superior de Agronomia (ISA), the university school of agronomy of the Technical University of Lisbon, is among the oldest, largest and most prestigious in the country regarding both the teaching of agricultural sciences and research. Other public universities like the University of the Algarve and the University of √âvora, have departments for both agronomy and agriculture, or related engineerings. The Instituto Nacional dos Recursos Biol√≥gicos (INRB) is the national research institute for agriculture and fisheries.

The fourth tropical cyclone and second hurricane of the 1996 Pacific hurricane season, Boris formed out of a tropical wave roughly south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec on June 27\\\\. The storm gradually intensified, becoming a tropical storm the following day and then hurricane on June 29\\\\. As the storm neared landfall, an eye developed and Boris reached its peak intensity with winds of 90 mph (150 km/h). Shortly after, the hurricane made landfall along the south coast of Mexico, between Lazaro Cardenas and Acapulco, at this intensity. Boris quickly weakened following its landfall, becoming a tropical depression roughly 18 hours later. The remnants of the system persisted until July 1, at which time it dissipated just offshore the Mexican coastline. Boris caused heavy flooding in southern Mexico that resulted in ten fatalities; however, a damage estimate is unknown. Meteorological history Hurricane Boris originated from a tropical wave that moved off the west coast of Africa on June 8. The poorly organized wave tracked westward across the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea and entered the Pacific Ocean on June 23. The first signs of a circulation on satellite imagery appeared on June 26, centered about south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec. The system gained enough circulation definition and rainbands to acquire tropical depression status on June 27. Upon becoming a tropical cyclone, the Aviation forecast model predicted Tropical Depression Four-E to make landfall in Mexico as a weak tropical storm in 12 hours. Around that time, the forecast track was issued by the National Hurricane Center late on June 27, stating that it would receive an outflow near Hurricane Alma. At the same time, the UKMET model had Tropical Depression Four-E remaining offshore Mexico. The same model also had the depression becoming Tropical Storm Boris. The National Hurricane Center forecasted Tropical Depression Four-E to become Tropical Storm Boris and make landfall in Mexico with winds of . In the same advisory, it was noted that the outer rain bands of Tropical Depression Four-E had moved onshore Mexico. The tropical cyclone moved northwestward at 8 to 10 knots, and for the next two days its maximum sustained winds strengthened from to . A ragged eye appeared on satellite imagery just before landfall on the afternoon of June 29, at a peak intensity of . The center crossed the south coast of Mexico midway between Lazaro Cardenas and Acapulco. Shortly after landfall, Boris weakened to a depression and turned southwestward in response to a building subtropical ridge to its north. The system, thoroughly disrupted by the mountainous terrain of Mexico, dissipated on the July 1 after moving back over water just south of Puerta Vallarta. Preparations, impact and aftermath As Hurricane Boris was approaching Mexico, a tropical storm watch was issued for the coast between Manzanillo and Puerto Escondido on June 28. From Manzanillo to Puerto Maldonado, the tropical storm replaced with a hurricane warning the same day. Rainfall from Boris Boris caused ten deaths. One person was killed in Tecpan. Nearby, three other people drowned and five fishers were missing. In Acapulco, a child was killed when a roof collapsed. Also, in Acapulco, strong surf pushed fishing boats against a sea wall. Trees were downed, and business signs were blown down. Streets were flooded to the level of the tires. Trees were knocked down . A total of about 10,000 people were left homeless, and at least 70 people were injured. Damage is unknown. Rain was heavy throughout the impacted region, with the highest totals in Guerrero. A total of was recorded in Coyuca de Ben√≠tez. The highest total was at Paso de San Antonio, to the east of the point of landfall. Those rains caused a flood on the San Jeronimo River, which left at least 5000 homeless. In Tecpan, a countless number of homes were washed away. Winds went as high as . The storm flooded lobbies of hotels along the coast. Approximately 12 boats were sunk offshore. Tecpan bore the brunt of the storm, reporting heavy damage. The area was impacted by Hurricane Alma just a few days before. On July 18 the President of Mexico had a meeting for the victims of Boris and Cristina, a storm later that season, in Acapulco, Mexico.

He was the first central bank governor in the country who came from within the State Bank of Pakistan and not belonging to a political party or international bodies like IMF etc.  Education  Born in Allahabad, India, in 1929 in the village area of Pargana Chail. Hanfi got his schooling at the CAV High School and completed intermediate school education at the Union Christian College. Hanfi suffered severe bronchitis and asthmatic problems in his childhood and doctors advised his parent to keep him away from studies or sports; which is why he started formal education from grade 5 only. In 1947 following the independence of Pakistan in 1947, when he was 18, his family left Allahabad and moved to Karachi, Pakistan where his father entered the civil service. Hanfi enrolled in Islamia College and went on to complete a master's degree in economics at the University of Karachi in 1952 standing First Class First position. During his higher education, his family was based in Hyderabad; where his father was an officer in Pakistan Railways.  State Bank of Pakistan career  Hanfi always wanted to join the Civil Service however he applied for an opening as an SBP Class I Officer, attending the interview on the insistence of his roommate. He was posted at Lloyd's Bank in Karachi as an SBP trainee in 1952. In the post-training exams, although he stood at the top of the batch nationally, though he was obsessed with following his father into the civil service and Hanfi had no plans to pursue a career at the SBP. Hanfi was sent to World Bank training course (6 months) where representatives from 130 countries were also attending. It was unusual for a young officer (aged 27) to be sent for such a course when only seniors officer used to be sent abroad with political or other links. Hanfi surprised the SBP top management when he took his first position in the training course which involved managing various World Bank task for different countries in a simulated environment among all the 130 international participants. He was given a hero's welcome by the SBP management on his return. He would spend more than forty years at the central bank, with one brief stint as the chief executive of PICIC between 1981 and 1984. In 1984 he was recalled as deputy governor and eventually went on to be appointed as Governor of the State Bank in 1988. He is also the only governor who has been appointed twice on the post; as Qasim Parekh was appointed as Governor State Bank when Hanfi resigned from the post, subsequent to his long-standing non-agreement with PPP government on policy issues.  Policy highlights  Hanfi started the financial sector reforms in 1987. He introduced a system of treasury bills auctions and foreign exchange reforms, including the relaxation and dismantling of controls; however, the most important was the handling of the BCCI crisis and privatization of the financial sector. Hanfi faced pressure from international liquidators as well as Ministry of Finance (on international pressure) regarding the BCCI crisis, but Pakistan became the only country where depositors at BCCI were fully repaid. Hanfi was adamant that BCCI Pakistan was locally incorporated and as per the Articles any assets of the bank would be handed over to international liquidator only if the local bank is facing bankruptcy and all local depositors have been paid off. Hanfi also participated heavily in bank reforms. Banks had originally had credit ceilings, a practice not in line with a market-based financial system, and Hanfi did away with them and brought capital adequacy in line with international requirements.  Fall out with government  Hanfi since was not affiliated to any political party and had a very clean past; thus had no weak points and thus the political government of PPP and PMLN found it very difficult to get things done their way when it came to monetary policy. It was reported by famous journalist Shaheen Sahbai that Governor Sindh Jam Sadiq Ali openly told people that he would get Hanfi's family kidnapped as he was not approving the establishment of Mehran Bank. Later on, his son, Hamid, was actually kidnapped and returned home after 34 days. In this time Hanfi resigned from his post however his resignation was rejected by then the President of Pakistan, Ghulam Ishaq Khan. It is important to note that Ghulam Ishaq Khan had worked with Hanfi during his days as Governor of State Bank.  Personal life  Hanfi has 4 children with his wife Razia; namely Zahida, Hamid, Farhi and Hena. He also had 4 brothers. Hanfi always avoided evening parties be it official or non-official; nor did he socialize with any politicians and civil bureaucracy. He didn't even move to the Governor Residence (a lavish British style mansion next to British Council, Karachi) and stayed in his private house that he built in 1966. He died on 22 April 2015, at his residence.

It is a small town that has grown over the years. Some major towns in the municipality are Tala (municipal seat), El Refugio, San Isidro Mazatepec, Cuisillos, and Ahuisculco.Tala (Jalisco State Government official site)Enciclopedia de Los Municipios y Delegaciones de M√©xico: Tala, JaliscoTala: Diagn√≥stico del Municipio (Instituto de Informaci√≥n Estad√≠stica y Geogr√°fica) History \\"Tlallan\\", \\"Tala\\" or \\"Land of labor\\". It was a manor ruled by Pythaloc who had under his jurisdiction Ahuitzculco, Ocot√°n, Nextipac and Xocot√°n. It is believed that its foundation dates back to 1126. Nu√±o Beltr√°n de Guzm√°n conquered it in 1530 and was evangelized in 1531 by Fray Antonio de Segovia, Fray Juan de Badillo and Fray Andr√©s de C√≥rdova. The peninsular found the ruins of Cu√©s or shrines scattered in the Tala Valley. The aborigines did not submit easily to the conquerors and had two battles with them. Tala was compromised in the jurisdiction of the Kingdom of Nueva Galicia as a corregimiento. Its first ruler was Francisco Socorro Nu√±o de Guzm√°n who was the most combative aborigine, and Pedro Pati√±o de Guzm√°n was left in his place. In 1579 it was entrusted to Diego de Colio. Its inhabitants had a forest that they loved very much, being forced to cut it down when the Spaniards arrived. Out of sarcasm or contemptuously they began calling the town Talatitl√°n, degenerating into its current name. Throughout the colonial era, Tala retained its category of corregimiento. Since 1825 it belonged to the first Canton of Guadalajara and the department or party of Zapopan; and on that date Tala already had a town hall. On April 3, 1844 the town hall is established. Since 1847 it belonged to the 1st Canton of Guadalajara and the Department or Zapopan Party. In 1887 it has category of town. In 1995 Tala is elevated to the category of city. By 1890 the town of Tala included in its jurisdiction the following towns and farms: El Refugio, Cuisillos, Huaxtla, San Isidro, Ahuisculco, Santa Ana Tepetitl√°n and Navajas. In 1920 they are annexed to the municipality Cuxpala and San Isidro. By decree number 10211, published on January 10, 1980, it was decided that the population of Tala would rise to the category of city, having achieved higher rates of progress in the political, economic, cultural, social, demographic aspects; for its infrastructure works and in merit to the greatness and dignity of its inhabitants that are characterized by their civic, moral and intellectual qualities. Tourism Historical Monuments Temple of San Francisco de As√≠s, Chapel of the Rosary, Treasury of the Orenda√≠n Refuge. Archeological zones In the Tala Valley there are scattered archeological vestiges of what in the pre-Hispanic era were shrines or cu√©s. In the region they are known as Guachimonton.

Background  It is not known what year Pei Zunqing was born‚Äîbut as he was said to be in his 90s at his death in 775, based on Chinese protocol of age-counting, he would have been born between 677 and 686. He was from a prominent clan of Jiang Prefecture (Áµ≥Â∑û, in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi), which traced its ancestry to officials of Han Dynasty, Cao Wei, Jin Dynasty (265-420), Western Liang, Northern Wei, and Tang Dynasty. Pei Zunqing's grandfather Pei Yihong (Ë£¥Áæ©Âºò) served as a mid-level official at the legislative bureau of government (‰∏≠Êõ∏ÁúÅ, Zhongshu Sheng) and carried the title of Duke of Xuanwu. Pei Zunqing's father Pei Quan (Ë£¥ÊÉì) was a prefectural prefect and carried the title of Baron of Hedong. Pei Zunqing had at least two older brothers, Pei Zunyu (Ë£¥ÈÅµË£ï) and Pei Zunye (Ë£¥ÈÅµÊ•≠).New Book of Tang, vol. 71.1.  During Emperor Xuanzong's reign  It was said that Pei Zunqing was ambitious but mild in his disposition, and he was studious and careful in his behavior in his youth. When he had become relatively old for a new official, he, on account of his heritage, was made the legal officer at Lu Prefecture (ÊΩûÂ∑û, in modern Changzhi, Shanxi). Because of his relatively old age, he was not noticed, but was eventually summoned to the Tang capital Chang'an to serve in the ministry of civil service affairs (ÂêèÈÉ®, Libu), and then to serve as Dali Cheng (Â§ßÁêÜ‰∏û), the secretary general of the supreme court (Â§ßÁêÜÂØ∫, Dali Si). It was said that he was capable in judging cases and decided them logically. On one occasion, because the general Xiao Keji (Ëï≠ÂÖãÊøü) was harsh toward his subordinates, his soldiers made comments that suggested they were suggesting rebellion. When they were charged with treason, Pei responded, \\"They had no money to gather people, and no talent to command people. How could they commit treason?\\"New Book of Tang, vol. 140. It was said that because of Pei's judgment, tens of households were saved. Later, late in Emperor Xuanzong's Tianbao era (742-756), Pei served as a junior official at the ministry of civil service affairs and was in charge of selecting the junior officials. It was said that because the realm was peaceful at times, each year there would be tens of thousands of people coming to Chang'an seeking official commissions. Pei was said to be dexterous, knowledgeable, good in memory, detailed, and not harsh, despite the large amount of work he had to carry out, and was said to be the best at the task. During this period, he wrote a work known as the Records of the Kings' Governance (ÁéãÊîøË®ò), discussing the rites from ancient days to his own days; it was said that those who read the work saw that he had talent to be a high-level official. Toward the end of the Tianbao era, the chancellor Yang Guozhong was exceedingly powerful, and he sent most officials who were not his followers away from the capital. As Pei did not flatter Yang, he was sent out of the capital to serve as a commandery governor.  During Emperor Suzong's reign  After Emperor Xuanzong was succeeded by his son Emperor Suzong in 756, Emperor Suzong recalled Pei Zunqing to serve as imperial attendant (Áµ¶‰∫ã‰∏≠, Jishizhong), Shangshu You Cheng (Â∞öÊõ∏Âè≥‰∏û, one of the secretaries general at the executive bureau (Â∞öÊõ∏ÁúÅ, Shangshu Sheng)), and deputy minister of civil service affairs (ÂêèÈÉ®‰æçÈÉé, Libu Shilang). Pei was said to be frugal and careful, drawing much praise. While Xiao Hua was chancellor, he knew Pei well and, whenever he met Emperor Suzong, would recommend Pei for promotion. In 761, based on Xiao's recommendation, Pei was made Huangmen Shilang (ÈªÉÈñÄ‰æçÈÉé) ‚Äî the deputy head of the examination bureau (ÈñÄ‰∏ãÁúÅ, Menxia Sheng) ‚Äî and given the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (Âêå‰∏≠Êõ∏ÈñÄ‰∏ãÂπ≥Á´†‰∫ã), making him a chancellor de facto.  During Emperor Daizong's reign  Emperor Suzong died in 762 and was succeeded by his son Emperor Daizong. Pei Zunqing continued to serve as chancellor. In 763, when the relationship between the imperial government and the general Pugu Huai'en had become exceedingly tense, because Emperor Daizong knew Pei to be faithful and honest, he sent Pei to Hezhong (Ê≤≥‰∏≠, in modern Yuncheng) to try to soothe Pugu and persuade him to report to Chang'an. Pei was initially able to persuade Pugu to do so, but after opposition by Pugu's subordinate Fan Zhicheng (ËåÉÂøóË™†), Pugu changed his mind, and Pei returned to Chang'an empty-handed. (Pugu eventually rebelled, and his rebellion was only ended when he died in 765.) In 763, when a surprise attack on Chang'an by the Tibetan Empire forced Emperor Daizong to flee Chang'an, Pei was able to escape and follow Emperor Daizong to Shan Prefecture (ÈôùÂ∑û, in modern Sanmenxia, Henan). After Emperor Daizong returned to Chang'an, Pei and a fellow chancellor, Miao Jinqing, were removed from their chancellor posts and given honorary positions‚Äîin Pei's case, as an advisor to Emperor Daizong's crown prince Li Kuo. Pei was soon made minister of civil service affairs (ÂêèÈÉ®Â∞öÊõ∏) and You Puye (Âè≥ÂÉïÂ∞Ñ), one of the heads of the executive bureau. He was again put in charge of selecting officials. As Pei was extremely old at the time, he was allowed to carry out this task at his mansion, which was considered a very high honor. On one occasion, a distant relative of his submitted an accusation that Pei was plotting treason, but Emperor Daizong knew of his carefulness and faithfulness and took no heed of the accusation. In his old age, Pei was said to be even more strict in his own behavior‚Äîhe would be displeased if someone he recommended came to thank him as he found it to be inappropriate; and while he often conversed with Emperor Daizong to give advice, he would destroy the records of their conversations later. He died in 775, while still serving in these duties. His great-grandson Pei Shu would later serve as chancellor near the end of Tang Dynasty, under Emperor Zhaozong and Emperor Ai.

It was established on July 9, 1871 and is the first Catholic school for girls in Western Visayas. History Founding Colegio de San Jos√© had its beginning in 1872. Ildefonso Moral, rector of the Jaro Archdiocesan Seminary, and Recardo Mascu√±ana signed the contract of its establishment on July 9, 1871. On May 1, 1872 the Daughters of Charity opened a school to provide Christian education for girls. In 1877 they decided to give up the school for lack of resources. Bishop Mariano Cuartero of Jaro realized the need for the teaching and the catechetical services of the Sisters. So he gave them full charge of the Escuela Municipal, a free school for the poor, located at Sta. Isabel and Lopez Jaena Streets. In 1881 another storey was added to the nuns' quarters to answer to the urgent request of the parents. A dormitory for girls and a chapel were inaugurated by Leandro Arrue, Bishop of Jaro. In 1892 Domingo Viera and the mother superior of the Daughters of Charity Juana Goita, conceived the plan of constructing a college managed and owned by the Daughters of Charity. The Sisters were to continue managing the Escuela Municipal. With the help of the higher Superiors and new loyal benefactors, the work immediately started. The site was located at East Lopez Street. Manuel Uytiepo aided the sisters in finishing the building. In spite of the interruption of the Revolution of 1896, the new Colegio de San Jose was inaugurated on March 19, 1896. Along with the reconstruction of the building was the organization of the administration, re-examination of the education objectives, and adoption of new methods to suit the needs of the students. The curriculum included Reading, History, Writing, Arithmetic, Spanish Grammar, Practical Arts, and Religious and Moral Training. The emphasis was Christian formation and Christian manners and right conduct. On September 14, 1917, five of the Sisters from Colegio de San Jos√© started the Colegio del Sagrado Corazon de Jesus in Iloilo City proper. In 1926, the college was allowed to grant high school diplomas. Later on, it offered college courses like Music, Teacher Education, Secretarial and Commerce. Colegio de San Jose, the oldest school for girls in Western Visayas, had a complete library, a school of music, plus complete courses from pre-elementary to college. Fire and new building On August 30, 1958, the school was razed by fire of undetermined origin. The Viritas, local newspaper, quoted that the burning of Colegio de San Jose was both material and historic loss to Iloilo. The history of the education and cultural works of the Daughters of charity of St. Vincent de Paul was destroyed. In the early 1950s, the Escuela Municipal became a free school serving as a laboratory for the in-campus practice teaching of normal education students. It functioned and even flourished after the fire of 1958 the building having withstood the fire. Church and government official, heads of schools, superiors of the congregation like Ana Cassassas and Hermenegilda Beroiz and Zacariaz Zubinas, the whole Daughters of Charity province, lay benefactors and alumni all over the country, contributed to the rebuilding of the new college building. The new building was blessed by Jose Ma. Cuenco, Archbishop of Jaro on November 27, 1959. After Ines Pe√±a reconstructed the college and put things in order, Tarsila Palermo took over the management. During her term she also had the supervision of the opening of the Marillac Academy in Miag-ao, a sister institution of Colegio de San Jose. Concepcion Gotera who succeeded Palermo, carried on with the preparation of the school, until on September 6, 1969, it was officially opened. Then Ines Pe√±a took over, followed by Soledad Torre. March 1979 marked a new thrust in the administration of CSJ and other D.C. schools. A new vision systematizing the management, supervision and administration of all D.C. schools was adopted. The Catholic School System Development Program was integrated in the Daughters of Charity Mission Statement. School year 1981-1982 saw Colegio de San Jose making a forward thrust by opting for PAASCU accreditation. While the Basic Education Department had undergone and passed the Preliminary and Formal Survey, the College Department, in coordination with the faculty, students, personnel, parents, alumni and community launched the PAASCU Preliminary Survey on January 19‚Äì20, 1987. Modernization A Computer Laboratory was installed in 1988 and computer subjects were offered in all courses. In 1990, the Two- Year Computer Secretarial was offered with the new Bachelor of Science in Accountancy program. The computer facilities were upgraded in 1993, Computer Technology was added as a new major in the AB, BSED, BEED programs while Computer Management was added as a new major in the BSC program. The best feature of the Basic Education Department is its Personalized Education Program as confirmed by PAASCU Re-accreditation in 1988 for Upper BED and in 1990 for Lower BED. Through the support of the alumni, parents and students, a new four-storey building was inaugurated and blessed on November 24, 1991 by Most Reverend Alberto Piamonte, D.D. on the occasion of the 400th Birth Anniversary of St. Louise de Marillac. Dedicated to her, this building is now the College Building or the Higher Education Department. A new audio-visual room was installed and blessed on November 28, 1991. In response to the increasing school population, Health Services Center was relocated in 1991. It was centrally located within the school campus where emergency needs can be adequately provided. The 120th Foundation Anniversary of Colegio de San Jose was marked by the launching of Basic Ecclesial Communities on October 2, 1992. A big budgeted play titled Louise written and directed by Fr. James Reuter, S.J. shown on November 27‚Äì29, 1992, stole the limelight as it duplicated the success of a similar play produced in Manila by the DC schools. Colegio de San Jose was chosen as a pilot school in 1993-94 for the Revised Religious Education Program in the DC Schools System. In February 1994, the Upper Basic Education Department was successfully granted by PAASCU another five-year accredited status. Commendable is the sincere and earnest efforts of the Administration to work for Lay Empowerment wherein co-responsibility is given to lay partners. Faced with challenge of the school's mission to build Christian Communities, the Faculty and Non-Teaching Personnel of Colegio de San Jose underwent series of retreats and seminars to prepare them to Basic Ecclesial Communities which have evidently strengthened the harmonious relationship between and among faculty members, administration, students and parents. This contributed greatly to the continual building up of Colegio de San Jose into a Christian-Vincentian community, developing in them a strong sense of dedication and spirit of service. School year 1994-95 was geared toward PAASCU Re-Survey of the Lower Basic Education Department and Formal PAASCU Survey for the Higher Education Department. A three-year accredited status was granted by PAASCU to the Higher Education Department on April 21, 1995. It is an ongoing concern of the administration to improve its facilities and provide better learning encounters for the clientele. During the school year 1994-1995, a new Reading Center and an office for the Student Personnel Services were installed. The Music Room had been relocated, and this revived students' potentials for music. Special courses in Piano, Guitar, Organ and Voice are offered. In the same school year, initial efforts toward integrated administration between Colegio de San Jose and its sister school, Colegio del Sagrado Corazon de Jesus were effected to realize the SLMSS-DC school system approach. In this set-up, CSJ and CSCJ share a common president. To respond to the needs of the growing population, a new three-storey building was inaugurated and blessed in June 1996. This is now the St. Joseph Building that houses the Lower Basic Education. In summer 1996, Colegio de San Jose, in its efforts to continuously provide relevant quality education in answer to the demands of the times and advance in technology, started to extend its computer facilities to the larger community of offering short/special courses in computer. In like manner, the Higher Education enriched its curriculum during the school year 1996-1997 by offering Management Accounting as an additional major in the Commerce Program. The continuing development of Colegio de San Jose is a collaborative effort of committed administration, faculty, personnel, students, parents, and alumni journeying together toward an integrated academic and non-academic programs with Christian formation as the core permeating all its activities.

It was built between 1850 and 1925 by the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) to supply the railroad with locomotives, railroad cars and related equipment. For many years it was the largest railroad shop complex in the world. History In 1849, PRR officials developed plans to construct a repair facility at a town newly established for this purpose, Altoona. Construction was started in 1850, and soon a long building was completed in the 12th Street area that housed a machine shop, woodworking shop, blacksmith shop, locomotive repair shop and foundry. The 12th Street area facilities were replaced later by the Altoona Machine Shops. The first locomotive was built there in 1866. A total of 6,783 steam, diesel and electric locomotives were manufactured in Altoona between 1866 and 1946. In time additional PRR repair facilities were located in Harrisburg, Pittsburgh, and Mifflin, and the Altoona Works expanded in adjacent Juniata. Inventor Alexander Graham Bell sent two assistants to the Altoona shops in 1875 to study the feasibility of installing telephone lines. In 1875, the Altoona Works started a testing department for PRR equipment. In following years, the Pennsylvania Railroad led the nation in the development of research and testing procedures of practical value for the railroad industry. In 1905 a Stationary Testing Plant was installed at Altoona, after originally being installed, and used for locomotive testing, in 1904 as one of the PRR System exhibits at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis. Locomotives tested on the plant included T1 4-4-4-4 No.6110\\"Locomotive And Railway Preservation\\" The Magazine of Historic Railwaay Preservation, Number 9, July-August 1987, ISSN 0891-7647, p.22 and Baldwin No. 60,000http://www.cwrr.com/Lounge/Reference/baldwin/part02.html Use of the testing facilities was discontinued in 1968 and many of the structures were demolished. The turntable at the Altoona Works in 2014 In May 1877, telephone lines were installed for various departments to communicate with one another. Fort Wayne, Indiana, also held a key position for the railroad. By the turn of the 20th century, its repair shops and locomotive manufacturing facilities became known as the \\"Altoona of the West.\\" In the 1920s the site consisted of 125 buildings on , and the shops employed over 16,000 workers.

Portions of the complex are still in use by Norfolk Southern Railway (NS). By 1945 the Altoona Works had grown to be one of the largest repair and construction facilities for locomotives and cars in the world. During World War II, PRR facilities (including the Altoona Shops) were on target lists of German saboteurs. They were caught before they could complete their missions.

A - Objective B - Galilean telescopes (rotating objectives) C - Zoom control D - Internal objective E - Prism F - Relay lens G - Reticle H - Eyepiece The stereo, stereoscopic or dissecting microscope is an optical microscope variant designed for low magnification observation of a sample, typically using light reflected from the surface of an object rather than transmitted through it. The instrument uses two separate optical paths with two objectives and eyepieces to provide slightly different viewing angles to the left and right eyes. This arrangement produces a three-dimensional visualization of the sample being examined.\\"Introduction to Stereomicroscopy\\" by Paul E. Nothnagle, William Chambers, and Michael W. Davidson, Nikon MicroscopyU. Stereomicroscopy overlaps macrophotography for recording and examining solid samples with complex surface topography, where a three-dimensional view is needed for analyzing the detail. The stereo microscope is often used to study the surfaces of solid specimens or to carry out close work such as dissection, microsurgery, watch-making, circuit board manufacture or inspection, and fracture surfaces as in fractography and forensic engineering. They are thus widely used in manufacturing industry for manufacture, inspection and quality control. Stereo microscopes are essential tools in entomology. The stereo microscope should not be confused with a compound microscope equipped with double eyepieces and a binoviewer. In such a microscope, both eyes see the same image, with the two eyepieces serving to provide greater viewing comfort. However, the image in such a microscope is no different from that obtained with a single monocular eyepiece.  History  The first optically feasible stereomicroscope was invented in 1892 and became commercially available in 1896, produced by Zeiss AG in Jena, Germany. 1896 Greenough Stereo Microscope by Carl Zeiss Jena American zoologist Horatio Saltonstall Greenough grew up in the elite of Boston, Massachusetts, the son of the famous sculptor Horatio Greenough Sr. Without the pressures of having to make a living, he instead pursued a career in science and relocated to France. At the marine observatory in Concarneau on the Bretton coast, lead by the former director of the Mus√©um national d'histoire naturelle, Georges Pouchet, he was influenced by the new scientific ideals of the day, namely experimentation. While dissection of dead and prepared specimens had been the main concern for zoologists, anatomists and morphologists, during Greenough‚Äôs stay at Concarneau interest was revived in experimenting on live and developing organisms. This way scientists could study embryonic development in action rather than as a series of petrified, two-dimensional specimens. In order to yield images that would do justice to the three-dimensionality and relative size of developing invertebrate marine embryos, a new microscope was needed. While there had been attempts to build stereomicroscopes before, by for example Ch√©rubin d‚ÄôOrleans and Pieter Harting, none had been optically sophisticated. Furthermore, up until the 1880s no scientist needed a microscope with such low resolution. Greenough took action and, influenced by his Concarneau colleague Laurent Chabry‚Äôs attempts to construct intricate mechanisms to turn and manipulate the live embryo, conceived of his own instrument. Building on the recent discovery of binocularity as the cause of depth perception by Charles Wheatstone, Greenough designed his instrument with the phenomenon of stereopsis in mind. Differences to normal optical microscopes Unlike a compound light microscope, illumination in a stereo microscope most often uses reflected illumination rather than transmitted (diascopic) illumination, that is, light reflected from the surface of an object rather than light transmitted through an object. Use of reflected light from the object allows examination of specimens that would be too thick or otherwise opaque for compound microscopy. Some stereo microscopes are also capable of transmitted light illumination as well, typically by having a bulb or mirror beneath a transparent stage underneath the object, though unlike a compound microscope, transmitted illumination is not focused through a condenser in most systems.\\"Illumination for Stereomicroscopy: Reflected (Episcopic) Light\\" by Paul E. Nothnagle, William Chambers, Thomas J. Fellers, and Michael W. Davidson , Nikon MicroscopyU. Stereoscopes with specially-equipped illuminators can be used for dark field microscopy, using either reflected or transmitted light.\\"Illumination for Stereomicroscopy: Darkfield Illumination\\" by William Chambers, Thomas J. Fellers, and Michael W. Davidson , Nikon MicroscopyU. Scientist using a stereo microscope outfitted with a digital imaging pick-up and fibre-optic illumination Great working distance and depth of field are important qualities for this type of microscope. Both qualities are inversely correlated with resolution: the higher the resolution (i.e. the greater the distance at which two adjacent points can be distinguished as separate), the smaller the depth of field and working distance. Some stereo microscopes can deliver a useful magnification up to 100√ó, comparable to a 10√ó objective and 10√ó eyepiece in a normal compound microscope, although the magnification is often much lower. This is around one tenth the useful resolution of a normal compound optical microscope. The large working distance at low magnification is useful in examining large solid objects such as fracture surfaces, especially using fibre-optic illumination as discussed below. Such samples can also be manipulated easily so as to determine the points of interest. There are severe limitations on sample size in scanning electron microscopy, as well as ease of manipulation in the specimen chamber. Magnification There are two major types of magnification systems in stereo microscopes. One type is fixed magnification in which primary magnification is achieved by a paired set of objective lenses with a set degree of magnification. The other is zoom or pancratic magnification, which are capable of a continuously variable degree of magnification across a set range. Zoom systems can achieve further magnification through the use of auxiliary objectives that increase total magnification by a set factor. Also, total magnification in both fixed and zoom systems can be varied by changing eyepieces. Intermediate between fixed magnification and zoom magnification systems is a system attributed to Galileo as the \\"Galilean optical system\\" ; here an arrangement of fixed-focus convex lenses is used to provide a fixed magnification, but with the crucial distinction that the same optical components in the same spacing will, if physically inverted, result in a different, though still fixed, magnification. This allows one set of lenses to provide two different magnifications ; two sets of lenses to provide four magnifications on one turret ; three sets of lenses provide six magnifications and will still fit into one turret. Practical experience shows that such Galilean optics systems are as useful as a considerably more expensive zoom system, with the advantage of knowing the magnification in use as a set value without having to read analogue scales. (In remote locations, the robustness of the systems is also a non-trivial advantage.) Illumination Stereomicroscope with an illuminated butterfly specimen Small specimens necessarily require intense illumination, especially at high magnifications, and this is usually provided by a fibre-optic light source. Fiber optics utilize halogen lamps which provide high light output for a given power input. The lamps are small enough to be fitted easily near the microscope, although they often need cooling to ameliorate high temperatures from the bulb. The fibre-optic stalk gives the operator much freedom in choosing appropriate lighting conditions for the sample. The stalk is encased in a sheath that is easy to move and manipulate to any desired position. The stalk is normally unobtrusive when the lit end is near the specimen, so usually does not interfere with the image in the microscope. Examination of fracture surfaces frequently need oblique lighting so as to highlight surface features during fractography, and fibre-optic lights are ideal for this purpose. Several such light stalks can be used for the same specimen, so increasing the illumination yet further. More recent developments in the lighting for dissecting microscopes include the use of high-power LEDs which are much more energy efficient than halogens and are able to produce a spectrum of colors of light, making them useful for fluorophore analysis of biological samples (impossible with a halogen or mercury vapor light source). Digital display Labomed LB-343 5.0 MP digital stereo microscope with 9 inch HD LCD screen, HDMI video output, X/Y digital micrometer and moving stage Video cameras are integrated into some stereo microscopes, allowing the magnified images to be displayed on a high resolution monitor. The large display helps to reduce the eye fatigue that would result from using a conventional microscope for extended periods. In some units, a built-in computer converts the images from two cameras (one per eyepiece) to a 3D anaglyph image for viewing with red/cyan glasses, or to the for clear glasses and improved color accuracy. The results are viewable by a group wearing the glasses. More typically, a 2D image is displayed from a single camera attached to one of the eyepieces.

He furthered his studies in London with Joseph Toynbee (1815-1866), later returning to Berlin, where he worked in Virchow's pathological institute. In 1871 he became an associate professor, and in 1874 was appointed director of the university policlinic for ear diseases. In 1899 Lucae became a full professor of otology at the University of Berlin. Lucae made numerous contributions in the field of otology, being remembered for his pioneer studies involving the transmission of sound via bone conduction for diagnosis of ear disease. He is credited with introducing an \\"interference otoscope\\", an apparatus he developed to determine the relative amount of reflection from both ears. His name is associated with several instruments used in otology, including the \\"Lucae pressure probe\\", a device which uses vibratory massage for treatment of the middle ear in cases of progressive deafness.

US Senate. Accessed 17 July 2009. This light, cotton-based material is traditional in the Southern United States. The tradition was started by Republican Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi in 1996 who wanted to \\"bring a little Southern charm to the Capitol\\" to remind the Senate of how Senators dressed before the advent of air conditioning in the 1950s. The practice was temporarily suspended in 2012 amid congressional gridlock, but began again in 2014.http://www.politico.com/gallery/2015/06/cotton-suit-up-its-seersucker- thursday-/002238-032045.html?hp=r4_4 While this tradition is an annual event, it is also common to see congressional staffers don seersucker suits on Thursdays throughout the year. History of the seersucker suit A blue and white seersucker jacket Seersucker weave was introduced to the American south, probably through British colonial trade, sometime in the second half of the 19th century. The cotton weave, which originated in western India, became a signature look of the United States in the early 20th century because its light weight and pre-rumpled surface made it ideal for the intense humidity of summer. The wearing of seersucker suits declined with the advent of air conditioning. By the 1950s, air conditioning reached the Capitol, ending the necessity of seersucker suits there. Gregory Peck famously wore a seersucker suit in the movie To Kill a Mockingbird, creating a clich√© of how small town Southern lawyers dressed invoked by later actors such as Andy Griffith. The image of a bow-tied, seersucker-suited young man in a boater hat is likewise a cliche image of a recent graduate of elite Northeastern colleges. History of Seersucker Thursday In 1996 Senator Trent Lott decided to bring the tradition back. His goal was to show that \\"the Senate isn‚Äôt just a bunch of dour folks wearing dark suits and‚Äîin the case of men‚Äîred or blue ties\\". In 2004, Senator Dianne Feinstein decided to increase participation by encouraging women senators to follow the tradition. The following year 11 of the 14 women senators appeared on Seersucker Thursday in outfits received as gifts from Feinstein. As of June 27, 2012, Seersucker Thursday was announced to be discontinued.http://www.politico.com/blogs/click/2012/06/seersucker- thursday-discontinued-127432.html As of May 27, 2015, Senator Bill Cassidy successfully advocated for the return of Seersucker Thursday. Cassidy remarked, \\"This uniquely American fashion has a storied history dating back to 1909...

It provides engineering support to 3 Commando Brigade Royal Marines (3 Cdo Bde RM) and is the largest Army Reserve Commando unit. The squadron has deployed worldwide to provide combat engineer support to 3 Cdo Bde RM, often deploying in small sub-units. 131 was first raised in 1947 as an airborne engineer regiment, and reached a strength of over 1,000 trained parachute engineers by the early 1960s. Between 1 April 1978 and 1 October 2015, the unit was an independent Commando squadron under operational command of HQ 3 Cdo Bde RM. On 2 October 2015, it formally became the third squadron of 24 Commando Engineer Regiment. History 1940s: Airborne Forces Role With the reformation of the Territorial Army in 1947, the unit was raised as 131 Airborne Engineer Regiment in support of 16th Airborne Division. The division, taking its number from the wartime 1st and 6th Airborne Divisions, was commanded at first by Major-General Roy Urquhart (who had led 1st Airborne Division at Arnhem in 1944) and consisted of three TA parachute brigades (44, 45 and 46 Parachute Brigades), each of three parachute battalions. With all volunteers going through 'P Company' to gain their Red Berets and earning their Parachute Wings at RAF Abingdon, the regiment provided a squadron of parachute engineers to support each brigade: 299 Airborne Field Squadron in Hull; 300 Airborne Field Squadron in Liverpool, later Glasgow; and 301 Airborne Field Squadron in Croydon. The regimental headquarters was in Pont Street in Knightsbridge, with 302 Airborne Field Park Squadron based in Hendon. Manning a regiment of this size presented no problems, with many recently demobilised World War II soldiers, including many former paratroopers, willing to join the regiment. Indeed, it was one of the fullest of all units within the brigade. Experienced leadership was also readily available. 299 Squadron was raised by Major George Widdowson, previously of the Green Howards, who had fought at Arnhem as second-in-command of the decimated 10th Battalion, Parachute Regiment, whilst at Surrey-based 301 Squadron Major Beverley Holloway became Officer Commanding and later regimental second-in-command. His World War II service included parachuting into Normandy on D Day as a troop commander with 3rd Parachute Squadron RE. 1950s Territorial Army reorganisations took place in 1956, with 16 Airborne Division being disbanded and replaced by a single TA parachute brigade, 44 Independent Parachute Brigade Group. 131 Regiment was sufficiently well established to ensure that it was retained in size but redesignated as 131 Parachute Engineer Regiment, with all squadron titles replacing the term \\"Airborne\\" with \\"Parachute\\". RHQ moved half a mile down the road to the Duke of York's Headquarters in the King's Road, co-located with Brigade Headquarters. Troop locations evolved through the 1950s too, with 301 Squadron moving to Guildford and gaining a Birmingham based troop as a result of the demise of 18th Battalion The Parachute Regiment. The Liverpool-based troop also went on to become part of 299 Squadron, whilst 300 Squadron, gained troops in Edinburgh and Falkirk to become wholly Scottish. One final change saw 302 Squadron move from Hendon to nearby Kingsbury, with its Luton-based Plant Troop also relocating to Kingsbury, in 1959. 1960s Dhala Road by 131 Parachute Engineer Regiment In the early 1960s, 131 fielded over 1,000 trained parachute engineers and was believed to have the largest number of men earning their annual bounty in the whole of the Territorial Army. Many of the unit's members were also members of the Emergency Reserve, giving them a higher call-out obligation. Basic training was only beginning to be introduced because, up until this time, almost all unit members were either ex-regulars, ex-WW2 volunteers or ex-National Servicemen. Throughout this period of the regiment's existence, squadron-sized detachments served their annual camps in many overseas theatres, carrying out close support and construction engineer tasks as well as parachuting with United States, Canadian, French and Italian forces. A major regimental event during the 1960s was Exercise Sea Splash, during which its soldiers would parachute into the harbour in St Peter Port in Guernsey, awaited by a fleet of small boats and cheering islanders. 131's first Honorary Colonel, Lieutenant General Sir Philip Neame VC, KBE, CB, DSO, had initiated the regiment's involvement with the island when he served as its governor after the war, and the parachute foray was always treated as a celebration of the liberation from German control in 1945. In 1965, the bulk of the regiment carried out its Annual Camp in Aden Protectorate and in 1966 elements of the regiment deployed to the country again. During the 1965 deployment ('Ex Jockey Club') on the night of 12 April, 300 Parachute Squadron was attacked by guerrillas whilst working with 24 Field Squadron on the construction of the Dhala Road at Al-Milah near the Yemen frontier. Squadron Sergeant Major John Lonergan of 300 Squadron and Sergeant Atfield, the pay sergeant of 24 Field Squadron, were both killed during the action and are buried at the Ma-Allah Cemetery, now within the Republic of Yemen. The Regimental Medical Officer, who risked his life to attend to those who had been wounded and to rescue two badly injured men caught out in the open, was awarded the MBE for gallantry. The incident became known as the Battle of Dhala. 131 Commando Squadron Royal Engineers base is named Lonergan Lines in honour of SSM Lonergan. The second major post-war reorganisation of the TA in 1967 saw the regiment reduced to a single independent squadron of 250 personnel on 1 April 1967. 131 Independent Parachute Squadron Royal Engineers (Volunteers) maintained its role in support of the three parachute battalions of 44 Parachute Brigade (Volunteers). Squadron Headquarters and the Support Troop was based in Kingsbury in London, with Troops in Birmingham, Hull and Grangemouth. Troops took the names of the Squadrons they had replaced, with 299 Troop in Hull, 300 Troop in Grangemouth, 301 Troop in Birmingham and 302 Troop (Support Troop) in Kingsbury. 1970s The three field troops each continued to support a TA parachute battalion, with 299 Troop linked to the 4th (Volunteer) Battalion The Parachute Regiment, 300 Troop to the 15th (Scottish Volunteer) Battalion and 301 Troop to the 10th (Volunteer) Battalion. Travel far and wide, with associated opportunities for engineer support, construction and parachuting continued as ever. At times, troops carried out annual camps in direct support of their battalions, such as 299's 1972 camp with 4 Para in Jamaica, whilst on other occasions the squadron exercised as a whole. In 1973, the squadron undertook Exercise Sacristan in the United Arab Emirates, which saw 180 members of the squadron deploy for between two and six weeks, carrying out a variety of construction tasks and desert training exercises. Close ties with 9 Independent Parachute Squadron RE, then based at Church Crookham, also continued throughout the period. On 28 September 1975, during Exercise Trent Chase, while the squadron was conducting its annual watermanship-based section competition on the River Trent in Nottinghamshire, an assault boat containing eleven Sappers of 300 Troop was swept over the Cromwell Weir near Newark. Ten of the eleven men were drowned, including two brothers, Sappers Stuart and Peter Evenden. After the military funerals, which took place in various parishes around Scotland, a memorial service was held at the site of the accident, and a stone of Scottish granite bearing the names of those killed was laid in a small commemorative garden close to the lock. Another memorial was established near Grangemouth, at Falkirk Cemetery, and the men are also commemorated at the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire. A bridge over the River Toscaig was built in their memory in 1996 at Toscaig near Applecross in Wester Ross. 1978: Commando Role In 1977, reductions in the regular and TA Airborne Forces were announced and on 31 March 1978, 44 Parachute Brigade (Volunteers) was disbanded in a parade at Altcar Ranges, near Liverpool. Although the three parachute battalions were retained, support arms and services were to be disbanded. On 1 April 1978, the squadron was accepted into the order of battle of 3 Commando Brigade Royal Marines. Exchanging Maroon Berets for Green, but retaining a significant parachute capability across its four locations, it was renamed 131 Independent Commando Squadron Royal Engineers (Volunteers). 1980s and 1990s In 1982, it was decided to raise a field troop in Plymouth to capitalise on the significant number of ex-regular Commando- trained personnel living in the area and the fact that 131's new sister- Squadron, 59 Independent Commando Squadron RE, was based within the town at Crownhill Fort (later Seaton Barracks). This sub-unit was to become the new 300 Troop, but whilst Grangemouth and Plymouth were both on the Squadron's order of battle, Plymouth used the old Support Troop number, 302 Troop, for a year. Recruiting at Plymouth was buoyant, and the then-Permanent Staff Instructor was awarded the British Empire Medal for his leadership in helping to establish the new Troop. Finally, in 1983, at a ceremony in Grangemouth, the Scottish 300 Troop was re-roled as a Royal Marines Reserve Assault Engineer Troop, and Plymouth took on the 300 Troop title. 21st Century 2001's annual training exercise took place in Oman (Ex Saif Sareea), setting the tone for more than a decade of operational activity by the squadron in the Middle East and Afghanistan. Fourteen personnel mobilised for service in Afghanistan with 3 Cdo Bde RM the following year (Op Jacana). The squadron was compulsorily mobilised in January 2003 and deployed in Iraq as part of Operation TELIC 1, returning to the UK in May. A significant proportion of the unit was mobilised for a second time in Autumn 2006 for service in Helmand Province in Afghanistan. Following the end of this deployment in Spring 2007, the squadron has supported a further nine tours of the province. Tasks and responsibilities were wide and varied as befits the extensive range of skills held within the unit, ranging from reconstruction advice through to close support engineering by sections embedded within Royal Marines rifle companies. Small teams also deployed to Iraq on Operation TELIC 4 in 2004/5 and to the Bagh region of Pakistan during humanitarian operations (Op Maturin) following the Kashmir earthquake in 2005. During 2006, the squadron effectively split in two to form 299 Parachute Squadron, centred on the very strongly recruited Hull-based 299 Troop, whilst retaining the three other locations within 131 and growing a new troop in Bath (302 Troop). On 2 October 2015, 131 formally became the third squadron of 24 Commando Engineer Regiment the Squadron retained the three previous field troop locations and Squadron Headquarters at Kingsbury. Current role As a Commando unit, the majority of the squadron's personnel have completed the Reserve Forces Commando Course, run by the Royal Marines at the Commando Training Centre at Lympstone. This demanding course is the foundation for all further training. As an engineer unit, the squadron trains for a variety of tasks from demolitions to construction. Structure The squadron consists of four troops based in the following locations around the UK: * Headquarters and Support Troop (Kingsbury in North West London) ‚Äì recruiting from London and the South East * 300 Troop (Plymouth) ‚Äì recruiting from Devon and Cornwall * 301 Troop (Sheldon in Birmingham) * 302 Troop (Bath) ‚Äì recruiting from Bristol, Bath, South Wales and the M4/M5 corridors Hull- based 299 Troop, which was part of 131 until 2007, later become the heart of the re-formed 299 Parachute Squadron.

During the protests, the natives took two police officers hostage. In response, the government declared a state of emergency in the departments of Cusco, Loreto and Amazonas, a move that gave it the power to send in the army to forcibly remove and arrest the protesters. Tensions peaked when Pizango responded to the government's threat to send in troops by stating that \\"Indigenous people are defending themselves against government aggression.\\"Reuters News Online - Peru may use army to end protests at energy sites The standoff ended when Pizango and his AIDESEP organization persuaded Congress to repeal two land laws aimed at opening up Amazonian tribal areas to petroleum companies, which had originally led to the protests by the indigenous tribes.

A quarter-wave impedance transformer, often written as Œª/4 impedance transformer, is a transmission line or waveguide used in electrical engineering of length one- quarter wavelength (Œª), terminated with some known impedance. It presents at its input the dual of the impedance with which it is terminated. It is a similar concept to a stub; but, whereas a stub is terminated in a short (or open) circuit and the length is chosen so as to produce the required impedance, the Œª/4 transformer is the other way around; it is a pre-determined length and the termination is designed to produce the required impedance. The relationship between the characteristic impedance, Z0, input impedance, Zin and load impedance, ZL is: \\\\frac{Z_\\\\mathrm{in}}{Z_0}=\\\\frac{Z_0}{Z_L} Applications The lumped-element low-pass filter (top) can be converted to a design that eliminates the inductors and contains capacitors only by the use of J-inverters, resulting in a mixed lumped-element and distributed-element design. At radio frequencies of upper VHF or higher up to microwave frequencies one quarter wavelength is conveniently short enough to incorporate the component within many products, but not so small that it cannot be manufactured using normal engineering tolerances, and it is at these frequencies where the device is most often encountered. It is especially useful for making an inductor out of a capacitor, since designers have a preference for the latter.Matthaei et al, pp.144-149. Another application is when DC power needs to be fed into a transmission line, which may be necessary to power an active device connected to the line, such as a switching transistor or a varactor diode for instance. An ideal DC voltage source has zero impedance, that is, it presents a short circuit and it is not useful to connect a short circuit directly across the line. Feeding in the DC via a Œª/4 transformer will transform the short circuit into an open circuit which has no effect on the signals on the line.Bhat & Koul, p.686. Likewise, an open circuit can be transformed into a short circuit.Bhat & Koul, pp.601-602. The device can be used as a component in a filter, and in this application it is sometimes known as an inverter because it produces the mathematical inverse of an impedance. Impedance inverters are not to be confused with the more common meaning of power inverter for a device that has the inverse function of a rectifier. Inverter is a general term for the class of circuits that have the function of inverting an impedance. There are many such circuits and the term does not necessarily imply a Œª/4 transformer. The most common use for inverters is to convert a 2-element-kindA 2-element-kind network is one consisting of only two kinds of elements, that is, LC, RC or RL circuits. LC filter design such as a ladder network into a one-element-kind filter. Equally, for bandpass filters, a two-resonator-kind (resonators and anti- resonators) filter can be converted to a one-resonator-kind. Inverters are classified as K-inverters or J-invertersThe K and J notation originates in archaic symbols for impedance and admittance respectively. The K is the same K that makes an appearance in the well known constant-k filter and the K parameter is defined for inverters of lumped-element design in exactly the same way as it is defined for the constant-k filter. For a Œª/4 transformer the difference is moot, the same device will serve as a K-inverter with an inverter parameter of K=Z0 or equally as a J-inverter with an admittance inverter parameter of J=Y0, the characteristic admittance (=1/Z0). depending on whether they are inverting a series impedance or a shunt admittance. Filters incorporating Œª/4 inverters are only suitable for narrow band applications. This is because the impedance transformer line only has the correct electrical length of Œª/4 at one specific frequency. The further the signal is from this frequency the less accurately the impedance transformer will be reproducing the impedance inverter function and the less accurately it will be representing the element values of the original lumped-element filter design.Matthaei et al, pp.434-435. Theory of operation impedance Smith chart. Looking towards a load through a length of lossless transmission line, the normalized impedance changes as increases, following the blue circle. At , the normalized impedance is reflected about the centre of the chart. Standing waves on a transmission line with an open-circuit load (top), and a short-circuit load (bottom). Black dots represent electrons, and arrows show the electric field. A quarter-wavelength away from the open-circuit, the current and voltage oscillations are exactly the same as at a short-circuit, and vice versa. This reflects the fact that open circuit () is dual to short circuit (). A transmission line that is terminated in some impedance, ZL, that is different from the characteristic impedance, Z0, will result in a wave being reflected from the termination back to the source. At the input to the line the reflected voltage adds to the incident voltage and the reflected current subtracts (because the wave is travelling in the opposite direction) from the incident current. The result is that the input impedance of the line (ratio of voltage to current) differs from the characteristic impedance and for a line of length l is given by;Connor, pp.13-16. :Z_\\\\mathrm{in}=Z_0 \\\\frac{Z_L + Z_0\\\\tanh(\\\\gamma l)}{Z_0 + Z_L\\\\tanh(\\\\gamma l)} :where Œ≥ is the line propagation constant. A very short transmission line, such as those being considered here, in many situations will have no appreciable loss along the length of the line and the propagation constant can be considered to be purely imaginary phase constant, iŒ≤ and the impedance expression reduces to, :Z_\\\\mathrm{in}=Z_0 \\\\frac{Z_L + iZ_0\\\\tan(\\\\beta l)}{Z_0 + iZ_L\\\\tan(\\\\beta l)} Since Œ≤ is the same as the angular wavenumber, :\\\\beta=\\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{\\\\lambda}\\\\ , for a quarter-wavelength line, :l=\\\\frac{\\\\lambda}{4}\\\\ , \\\\beta l = {\\\\pi \\\\over 2}\\\\ , and the impedance becomes, taking the limit as the tangent function argument approaches \\\\pi \\\\over 2 :Z_\\\\mathrm{in}=\\\\lim_{\\\\beta l \\\\rightarrow \\\\pi/2}{Z_0 \\\\frac{Z_L + iZ_0\\\\tan({\\\\beta l})}{Z_0 + iZ_L\\\\tan({\\\\beta l})}}=Z_0 \\\\frac{iZ_0}{iZ_L}=\\\\frac{{Z_0}^2}{Z_L} which is the same as the condition for dual impedances; :\\\\frac{Z_\\\\mathrm{in}}{Z_0}=\\\\frac{Z_0}{Z_L} Notes References *Bharathi Bhat, Shiban K.

He was born June 20, 1967 in Tokyo, Japan. He has helped found a number of notable video game companies and develops games at Route24, his own private limited company. The number 24 in the title comes from its founder's name: \\"Ni\\" (2) and \\"Shi\\" (4). Career Kenichi Nishi previously worked for both Telenet Japan and its subsidiary Riot. He was later hired by Square as a field designer for two of its larger releases. After leaving Square in 1995, Nishi helped establish Love-de-Lic, Inc. with many of his former Square coworkers. There, he designed two of the small company's three game releases: Moon: Remix RPG Adventure and L.O.L.: Lack of Love. He also helped design and write the script for the 1999 Polygon Magic title Incredible Crisis. Nishi then co-founded skip Ltd., a second-party developer for Nintendo. Acting as vice president of the company, he also directed GiFTPiA and co-directed Chibi-Robo!. Shortly thereafter, he left skip and founded Route24 on February 23, 2006. According to Nishi, he felt that working on large projects with a large group of people such as those at skip limited his freedom in designing games. He apparently still collaborates with them though, seeing Captain Rainbow (2008) credited him for the game's script. At Route24, Nishi and a staff of four other people developed LOL for the Nintendo DS, which was published by skip in 2007. He recently worked on Newtonica and Newtonica2 for the iPhone and iPod Touch with Kenji Eno, among other independently developed mobile games. In 2010, Nishi expressed interest in developing a sequel to Moon: Remix RPG Adventure, asking fans to voice their support via Twitter. Personal life Nishi lives in Meguro, Tokyo. He is a fan of British rock music and once had a dog named Tao, who Nishi featured as a character in many of his games including Moon: Remix RPG Adventure, GiFTPiA, L.O.L.: Lack of Love, Chibi-Robo and Captain Rainbow. Tao died in October 2009 due to kidney complications. It is said that Dragon Quest III is Nishi's favorite game.

O'Connor (1928 ‚Äì 31 October 2010), known as Johnny O'Connor, was an Irish hurler who played as a midfielder for the Waterford senior team. Born in Abbeyside, County Waterford, O'Connor first played competitive hurling during his schooling at Dungarvan CBS. He arrived on the inter-county scene when he first linked up with the Waterford minor team. He made his senior debut during the 1946‚Äì47 league. O'Connor subsequently became a regular member of the starting fifteen and won one All-Ireland medal and two Munster medals. He was an All-Ireland runner-up on one occasion. As a member of the Munster inter- provincial on a number of occasions O'Connor won one Railway Cup medal. At club level he won several championship medals playing with Abbeyside, Clonea, UCD, Castletownroche and Avondhu. O'Connor retired from inter-county hurling following the conclusion of the 1958 championship. Playing career Colleges During his schooling at Dungarvan CBS, O'Connor first established himself as a hurler of note. In spite of a lack of success in the Harty Cup, he was picked on the Munster colleges inter-provincial team, claiming winners' medals in 1945 and 1946. University As a mature student at University College Dublin in the mid-1950s, O'Connor was an automatic inclusion on the college hurling team. In 1958 he was at midfield as UCD faced University College Galway in the final of the inter-varsities championship. A huge 7‚Äì9 to 2‚Äì1 victory gave O'Connor a Fitzgibbon Cup medal. Club O'Connor first enjoyed club success in Dublin as a member of the University College Dublin team. In 1948 he won a championship medal as UCD won the decider for the second year in succession. Two years later and O'Connor was back in Waterford, playing with the Abbeyside team that reached the final of the junior championship. A 2‚Äì4 to 1‚Äì3 defeat of Dunhill gave him a championship medal in that grade. By 1952 O'Connor was lining out with the Clonea team. That year he played in the Waterford senior decider, with T. F. Meagher's providing the opposition. A 1‚Äì10 to 2‚Äì1 victory gave O'Connor a championship medal once again. A decade later and O'Connor, after settling in Cork, was lining out with Castletownroche. A 4‚Äì11 to 3‚Äì6 defeat of Youghal gave O'Connor yet another championship medal. In the twilight of his club career, O'Connor's performances for Castletownroche earned him a place on the Avondhu divisional team. In 1966 a unique championship decider pitted Avondhu against University College Cork. A 2‚Äì11 to 4‚Äì4 victory secured yet another championship medal for O'Connor. Inter-county O'Connor made his senior debut for Waterford on 3 November 1946 in a 2‚Äì3 to 3‚Äì5 defeat by Kilkenny in the opening round of the National Hurling League. He was still a secondary school student at the time. A year later on 29 June 1947, O'Connor made his championship debut in a 3‚Äì10 to 1‚Äì5 Munster semi-final defeat by Cork. In 1948 Waterford lined out in their first provincial decider in five years, with reigning champions Cork providing the opposition. After falling behind by five points early in the game, Waterford fought back to lead by a point at the interval. Goalkeeper Charlie Ware made some great saves while O'Connor stymied Cork's chief scorer Christy Ring to secure a 4‚Äì7 to 3‚Äì9 victory. It was O'Connor's first Munster medal. The subsequent All-Ireland final on 5 September 1948 pitted Waterford against Dublin. O'Connor's side started well and took a commanding 2‚Äì5 to 0‚Äì2 lead at the interval. Dublin rallied in the second half, however, Waterford quickly regained the upper-hand and powered to a 6‚Äì7 to 4‚Äì2 victory. Playing at centre-forward John Keane gave a masterclass, scoring three goals and two points and made most of the other scores. The victory gave O'Connor an All-Ireland medal. After the long-awaited breakthrough at All-Ireland level, Waterford went into decline for almost a decade as Tipperary and Cork went on to dominate the provincial and All- Ireland series. In 1957 Waterford broke back with O'Connor remaining as one of the veterans from the last glorious period. A 1‚Äì11 to 1‚Äì6 defeat of reigning provincial champions Cork gave O'Connor a second Munster medal. On 1 September 1957 Waterford lined out in the All-Ireland decider with Kilkenny providing the opposition. Over 70,000 spectators turned up at Croke Park to see an exciting game of hurling. With fifteen minutes left in the game Waterford led by six points. Two quick goals for \\"the Cats\\", together with a great point by captain Mickey Kelly reversed the trend and gave Kilkenny a 4‚Äì10 to 3‚Äì12 victory. O'Connor retired from inter-county hurling following Waterford's exit from the 1958 championship. Inter-provincial O'Connor first lined out for Munster in the inter-provincial series in 1954. He was an unused substitute throughout the campaign, as Munster were eventually bested by Leinster in the decider. The following year O'Connor, after playing in the opening game, was dropped from the starting fifteen for the decider. A 6‚Äì8 to 3‚Äì4 defeat of Connacht gave him his first Railway Cup medal, albeit as a non- playing substitute. Defeat was Munster's lot again in 1956, however, O'Connor was a member of the starting fifteen for the decider the following year. A 6‚Äì6 to 0‚Äì10 defeat of Connacht gave him a second Railway Cup medal, his first on the field of play. Personal life Born in Abbeyside, County Waterford, O'Connor was educated at the local national school before later attending Dungarvan CBS. After completing his Leaving Certificate in 1947, he studied to be a national school teacher at St. Patrick's College in Dublin. His first teaching post was at Col√°iste na Rinne in An Rinn, before later working for a while in the neighbouring An Sean Phobal. After a period spent in Canada, O'Connor returned to Ireland in 1959 where he took up the position of headmaster of the national school in Killavullen, County Cork. He was a greyhound trainer after his hurling career and won the prestigious 1973 English Greyhound Derby with a greyhound called Patricias Hope.

This colourless, hygroscopic solid is the product of the oxidation of pyridine. It was originally prepared using peroxyacids as the oxidising agent. The molecule is planar. The compound is used infrequently as an oxidizing reagent in organic synthesis. It also serves as a ligand in coordination chemistry. Synthesis and reactions The oxidation of pyridine can be achieved with a number of peracids including peracetic acid and perbenzoic acid in a reaction that affords the protonated derivative. Subsequent treatment with heating under low pressure removes acids as gases to liberates the neutral oxide. More recent reported approaches include a modified Dakin reaction using a urea- hydrogen peroxide complex, and oxidation by sodium perborate or, using methylrhenium trioxide () as catalyst, with sodium percarbonate. Pyridine N-oxide is five orders of magnitude less basic than pyridine, but it is isolable as a hydrochloride salt, [C5H5NOH]Cl, via a synthesis reported in Organic Syntheses: :C5H5N \\\\+ CH3CO3H -> C5H5NO*HOOCCH3 :C5H5NO*HOOCCH3 \\\\+ HCl -> [C5H5NOH]Cl \\\\+ CH3CO2H Considerable work has been done on synthesis of N-oxides from substituted pyridine starting materials and on chemical modifications of amine oxide systems, including the chlorination of the pyridine-N-oxide with phosphorus oxychloride which gives 4- and 2-chloropyridines.

Originally 78 T, a of the Austro- Hungarian Navy built in 1914, she was armed with two guns, four torpedo tubes, and could carry 10‚Äì12 naval mines. She saw active service during World War I, performing convoy, escort and minesweeping tasks, anti-submarine operations and shore bombardment missions. Following Austria-Hungary's defeat in 1918, she was allocated to the Navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which subsequently became the Royal Yugoslav Navy, and was renamed T3. At the time, she and the seven other 250t-class boats were the only modern sea-going vessels of the fledgling maritime force. During the interwar period, T7 and the rest of the navy were involved in training exercises and cruises to friendly ports, but activity was limited by reduced naval budgets. The ship was captured by the Italians during the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941. After her main armament was modernised, she served with the Royal Italian Navy under her Yugoslav designation, although she was only used for coastal and second-line tasks. Following the Italian capitulation in September 1943, she was captured by Germany and, after being fitted with additional anti-aircraft guns, served with the German Navy or the Navy of the Independent State of Croatia as TA48. In German/Croatian service her crew of 52 consisted entirely of Croatian officers and enlisted men. She was sunk by Allied aircraft in February 1945 while in the port of Trieste, where she had been built. Background In 1910, the Austro-Hungarian Naval Technical Committee initiated the design and development of a coastal torpedo boat, specifying that it should be capable of sustaining for 10 hours. This specification was based on expectations that the Strait of Otranto, where the Adriatic Sea meets the Ionian Sea, would be blockaded by hostile forces during a future conflict. In such circumstances, there would be a need for a torpedo boat that could sail from the Austro-Hungarian Navy base at the Cattaro (now Kotor) to the Strait during darkness, locate and attack blockading ships and return to port before morning. Steam turbine power was selected for propulsion, as diesels with the necessary power were not available, and the Austro-Hungarian Navy did not have the practical experience to run turbo-electric boats. Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino (STT) of Trieste was selected for the contract to build eight vessels, ahead of one other tenderer. The T-group designation signified that they were built at Trieste. Description and construction The , T-group boats had a waterline length of , a beam of , and a normal draught of . While their designed displacement was , they displaced about fully loaded. The crew consisted of 39 officers and enlisted men. The boats were powered by two Parsons steam turbines driving two propellers, using steam generated by two Yarrow water-tube boilers, one of which burned fuel oil and the other coal. The turbines were rated at with a maximum output of and designed to propel the boats to a top speed of . They carried of coal and of fuel oil, which gave them a range of at . The T-group had one funnel rather than the two funnels of the later groups of the class. Due to inadequate funding, 78 T and the rest of the 250t class were essentially coastal vessels, despite the original intention that they would be used for \\"high seas\\" operations. They were the first small Austro-Hungarian Navy boats to use turbines, and this contributed to ongoing problems with them. The boats were originally to be armed with three ≈†koda L/30 guns, and three torpedo tubes, but this was changed to two guns and four torpedo tubes before the first boat was completed, to standardise the armament with the F-group to follow. They could also carry 10‚Äì12 naval mines. The fifth of its class to be built, 78 T was laid down on 22 October 1913, launched on 4 March 1914, and completed on 23 August 1914. Later that year, one machine gun was added. Career World War I During World War I, 78 T was used for convoy, escort, minesweeping tasks, anti-submarine operations and shore bombardment missions. She also conducted patrols and supported seaplane raids against the Italian Adriatic coast. On 24 May 1915, 78 T and seven other 250t-class boats were involved in the shelling of various Italian shore-based targets known as the Bombardment of Ancona, with 78 T involved in the shelling of Porto Corsini near Ravenna. In the latter action, an Italian shore battery returned fire, hitting the scout cruiser and damaging one of the other 250t-class boats. On 23 July, 78 T and another 250t-class boat participated in a shore bombardment and landing operation led by Novaras sister ship against San Benedetto del Tronto, Ortona and Termoli on the central Adriatic coast of Italy. In late November 1915, the Austro-Hungarian fleet deployed a force from its main fleet base at Pola to Cattaro in the southern Adriatic; this force included six of the eight T-group torpedo boats, so it is possible that one of these was 78 T. This force was tasked to maintain a permanent patrol of the Albanian coastline and interdict any troop transports crossing from Italy. On 6 February 1916, the scout cruiser , 78 T and five other 250t-class boats were intercepted by the British light cruiser and French destroyer north of Durazzo in Albania, during which the only damage was caused by a collision between two of the other 250t-class boats. In 1917, one of her 66 mm guns was placed on an anti-aircraft mount. On 11 May 1917, the British submarine stalked 78 T off Pola, firing two torpedoes at her. The British captain had kept his submarine's periscope extended too far and for too long, and the tell-tale \\"feather\\" had alerted the crew of 78 T, allowing her crew to avoid the incoming torpedoes. That night, the , accompanied by 78 T and two other 250t-class boats, were pursued in the northern Adriatic by an Italian force of five destroyers, but were able to retire to safety behind a minefield. On 23 September, 77 T and 78 T were laying a minefield off Grado in the northern Adriatic when they had a brief encounter with an Italian MAS boat. On 28 November, a number of 250t-class boats were involved in two shore bombardment missions. In the second mission, 78 T joined seven other 250t-class boats and six destroyers for the bombardment of Porto Corsini, Marotta and Cesenatico. By 1918, the Allies had strengthened their ongoing blockade on the Strait of Otranto, as foreseen by the Austro-Hungarian Navy. As a result, it was becoming more difficult for the German and Austro-Hungarian U-boats to get through the strait and into the Mediterranean Sea. In response to these blockades, the new commander of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, Konteradmiral Mikl√≥s Horthy, decided to launch an attack on the Allied defenders with battleships, scout cruisers, and destroyers. During the night of 8 June, Horthy left the naval base of Pola in the upper Adriatic with the dreadnought battleships and . At about 23:00 on 9 June 1918, after some difficulties getting the harbour defence barrage opened, the dreadnoughts and , escorted by one destroyer and six torpedo boats, including 78 T, also departed Pola and set course for Slano, north of Ragusa, to rendezvous with Horthy in preparation for a coordinated attack on the Otranto Barrage. About 03:15 on 10 June, while returning from an uneventful patrol off the Dalmatian coast, two Royal Italian Navy () MAS boats, MAS 15 and MAS 21, spotted the smoke from the Austrian ships. Both boats successfully penetrated the escort screen and split to engage the dreadnoughts individually. MAS 21 attacked Tegetthoff, but her torpedoes missed. Under the command of Luigi Rizzo, MAS 15 fired two torpedoes at 03:25, both of which hit Szent Istv√°n. Both boats evaded pursuit. The torpedo hits on Szent Istv√°n were abreast her boiler rooms, which flooded, knocking out power to the pumps. Szent Istv√°n capsized less than three hours after being torpedoed. Inter- war years 78 T survived the war intact. In 1920, under the terms of the previous year's Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye by which rump Austria officially ended World War I, she was allocated to the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (KSCS, later Yugoslavia). Along with three other 250t-class, T-group boats, 76 T, 77 T and 79 T, and four F-group boats she served with the KSCS Navy (later the Royal Yugoslav Navy, , KJRM; –ö—Ä–∞—ô–µ–≤—Å–∫–∞ –à—É–≥–æ—Å–ª–æ–≤–µ–Ω—Å–∫–∞ –†–∞—Ç–Ω–∞ –ú–æ—Ä–Ω–∞—Ä–∏—Ü–∞). Transferred in March 1921, in KJRM service, 78 T was renamed T3. At the time of her transfer, she and the other 250t-class torpedo boats were the only modern sea-going warships in the Yugoslav fleet. In 1925, exercises were conducted off the Dalmatian coast, involving the majority of the navy. In May‚ÄìJune 1929, six of the eight 250t-class torpedo boats accompanied the light cruiser Dalmacija, the submarine tender Hvar and the submarines and , on a cruise to Malta, the Greek island of Corfu in the Ionian Sea, and Bizerte in the French protectorate of Tunisia. It is not clear if T5 was one of the torpedo boats involved. The ships and crews made a very good impression while visiting Malta. In 1932, the British naval attach√© was reporting that Yugoslav ships were engaging in few exercises or manoeuvres due to reduced budgets. World War II In April 1941, Yugoslavia entered World War II when it was invaded by the German-led Axis powers. At the time of the invasion, T3 was assigned to the Southern Sector of the KJRM's Coastal Defence Command based at the Bay of Kotor, along with her sister ship T1, several minesweepers and other craft. T3 was captured in port by the Royal Italian Navy and was operated by them under her Yugoslav designation. She was fitted with two L/30 anti-aircraft guns in place of her 66 mm guns, but no other significant alterations were made to her. Due to her obsolescence, the Italians only used T3 for coastal and second-line duties. When the Italians capitulated in September 1943, the German Navy () seized T3 in the port of Rijeka and renamed her TA48. She was commissioned on 15 August 1944, and was used for patrol and escort work in the northern Adriatic. The Germans added to her armament, fitting her with two single anti-aircraft guns in addition to the guns fitted by the Italians, and removing two of her torpedo tubes. She was either crewed exclusively by Croat officers and sailors but remained under German control, or was transferred to the Navy of the Independent State of Croatia but then repossessed by the Germans on 14 December 1944 due to the unreliable nature of the Croatian personnel. Her complement was also increased to 52 during her German/Croatian service. She was active in the northern Adriatic but saw little action. She was sunk in the port of Trieste by Allied aircraft on 20 February 1945.

Leader and founder of Galician Communist Party, Galician antifascist activist and partisan against Francisco Franco. This veterinary surgeon became provincial secretary of the Communist Party of Spain (PCE) in Ourense (Galicia) and president of the Provincial Peasant Federation, throughout the Second Spanish Republic. After the military coup in 1936 and the overthrow of Galicia by the franquist domain, he was haunted until his death by the local fascists, in 1937. His corpse was then shown by Civil Guard, tied to a truck, with a sign saying \\"Here's the Maceda's veterinary surgeon. Communism has died in Ourense\\".  Childhood, youth and political activism  Son of a veterinary surgeon so-called Dem√©trio, and of a schoolteacher, Felisa, his family belongs to local bourgeoisie, and his father was mayor of Maceda (Arn√≥ia's region, in Galicia), between 1913 and 1919. Benigno studied primary education in Maceda until he was eight years, and then he moved to the Galician capital, Santiago de Compostela, where he studied secondary education and then he did a degree in Veterinary Medicine. He finished the degree when he was twenty years old, in 1920. Then, he came to Maceda and worked in his father's veterinary clinic. During his student's years he was involved in student political activity, and he stood out because of his social commitment, especially during the period 1915-1916. During the twenties, he sympathizes with socialist ideas, and becomes to approach the Radical Socialist Party (PRS). Before that, in 1926, he had participated in the Ourense Veterinary Association. He's appreciated as a good professional and S√£o Mamede's mountain range's people are found of him on account of his professional dedication in a poor region like this. In those days, he collaborated with the agrarian movement, and wrote in publications such as \\"La Zarpa\\". He maintained fraternal relations with agrarian leaders like Bas√≠lio √Ålvares, on issues as rural rules abolition and struggle against rural tyranny in Galician land. In the 1930s: Galician commitment in the communist ranks In 1930, Benigno was arrested under the charge of \\"agit-prop activities\\" because he had taken part in activities in support of the pooerst Galician people in those years. Then, he made a hunger-strike against arbitrary repression he was subjected to. The next year, with the Second Republic coming (April 14), Benigno became Maceda's mayor, with a socialist program. A month later, he activates the Ourense Communist Party County Section, with other well-known activists, like Lu√≠s Souto (later, private secretary of Castelao in his American exile, from 1938), Gomes del Valle, Gaioso Frias, Clemente Vidal, Juan N√≥voa, Jesusa Prado, etc. Benigno moves to Ourense, in order to devote himself to politics, as the Communist Party politic secretary in that county. He defends not only the communist goals, but also the Galician national emancipation, considering it a nation without a state. Therefore, in 1932 he suggests to the party's Galician committee, which head office is in Vigo, the foundation of the Galician Communist Party, when the Communist Party was present in several Galician cities, such as Vigo, Ourense, Ferrol, Pontevedra, and A Coru√±a, but with no more than 300 activists. Galician committee defeats the proposal, and disapproves his political line as person in charge of \\"El Soviet\\", the party's publication. The Spanish Central Committee dislikes the Galician Benigno's guidance too, but \\"El Soviet\\" achieved 23 editions. In 1932, he and three other Galician comrades take part in fourth Spanish Congress of the Communist Party in Seville. As a Galician delegate, Benigno demands his right to defend his report on agrarian issues in the Galician language. Congress finally agrees, and a Portuguese comrade performs the function of an interpreter. In this year, Benigno married Henriqueta Fernandes Igrejas. They had a daughter, Icaro, but she died during the war, after the 1936 cup. In 1933, he stood in the election as candidate of the Popular Antifascit Block candidacy, but the results were unsuccessful. During the so- called \\"black two-year Period\\", Benigno is considered an enemy of the oligarchy in Ourense, and he's arrested under the charge of political activism in 1934. 1936: Fascist coup d'etat and resistance. Communists and Galician nationalists hunting The left-wing Popular Front wins the Spanish 1936 elections, and Benigno √Ålvares is one of the candidates in Galicia, with Alexandre B√≥veda as the Galician number one candidate. An electoral fraud prevented him from being chosen member of parliament. So the right-wing candidate, Jos√© Calvo Sotelo, won the election. In that same year, Benigno participates in the campaign for a Galician Autonomy Statute, with a tougher stance than his own party. After the militar coup on July 18, some militaries and fascists gangs usurped the power in Galicia and kill thousands of people, including left-wing persons and Galician nationalists. Benigno √Ålvares and his wife managed to scape to the S√£o Mamede mountain range and to the Edreira area, pursued by the fascists gangs. Benigno stays hidden until January 1937, in the Monte Rosso Castle, with the help of the Ulhoa family lady, admirer of him. Then, he decides to come back to the mountain and to organize a guerrilla resistance against fascism, around Monte de Ramo and Maceda area. Members of the local oligarchy offer a reward for Benigno √Ålvares: \\"1.000 pesetas for anyone who catch him dead or alive\\". Through some Portuguese contacts, he receives the offer to escape to America with Leandro Carro, a communist and member of the republican parliament, but Benigno decides to stay and to continue the fight in the Galician inland. The winter of 1937 was very hard for Benigno √Ålvares in the mountain range. Probably ill of tuberculosis, he is aware of the five peasant's execution that refused to revel to Civil Guard the place where he was hidden. He died next the Penedo's refuge, 100 meters from the Vixueses small village, on March 11, when he was 37 years old, on the way to Maceda. Lisardo Leal toke him over a mule, to the local doctor, but was impossible to save him. His corpse was founded on March 13 and a falangist shot him in the head, and so to receive the reward, but he didn't get it. A sergeant of Civil Guard, instigated by the local falangists, ordered to boast about the fact, with Benigno's corpse tied to a truck on Ourense's streets, and a sign saying \\"Here's the Maceda's veterinary surgeon. Communism has died in Ourense\\". The rest of the family will die victim of fascist repression around Ourense and Arn√≥ia area. Benigno √Ålvares memory in Maceda today It took so many years for Benigno's native village to pay tribute to him. It happened in the 90s, when a square was named with the name of 'Benigno √Ålvares', the antifascist a revolutionary Galician fighter.

He was said to be very capable as an official, but also treacherous and corrupt. His behavior eventually wore out Emperor Daizong's patience, and he was arrested and executed.  Background  Yuan Zai was born in 713, and it was known that his family was from Qi Prefecture (Â≤êÂ∑û, in modern Baoji, Shaanxi). His father's name was originally (ÊôØÊòá). Jing Sheng became the property manager for Princess Yuan, the wife of Li Ming (ÊùéÊòé) the Prince of Cao, a son of Emperor Taizong of Tang. He served her well, after asked for her, Jing Sheng changed his surname to Yuan. Yuan Zai lost his father early in life, and it was said that in his youth, he was studious and intelligent, and particularly well-studied in Taoist writings. He was so poor that he went to the local examinations (a prerequisite step to the imperial examinations) on foot, and he repeatedly failed to advance in the examinations.  During Emperor Xuanzong's reign  Early in the Tianbao era (742-756) of Emperor Xuanzong, Emperor Xuanzong began to favor Taoism, and he scheduled a special examination for scholars well-versed in the Zhuangzi, Laozi, Liezi, and Wenzi. Yuan Zai did well on this special examination and was made the sheriff of Xinping County (Êñ∞Âπ≥, in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi). When the imperial censor Wei Yi (ÈüãÁ∏ä) was put in charge of selecting officials from Qianzhong Circuit (Èªî‰∏≠, roughly modern Guizhou and western Hunan), he invited Yuan to serve as his assistant. After Yuan became better known, he was promoted to be Dali Pingshi (Â§ßÁêÜË©ï‰∫ã), a secretary at the supreme court (Â§ßÁêÜÂØ∫, Dali Si). Later, when the official Miao Jinqing served as the official in charge of the eastern capital Luoyang, he also invited Yuan to serve as his assistant. After that term of service, Yuan became Dali Sizhi (Â§ßÁêÜÂè∏Áõ¥), a junior judge at the supreme court.  During Emperor Suzong's reign  In 755, the general An Lushan rebelled at Fanyang Circuit (ËåÉÈôΩ, headquartered in modern Beijing) and established his own state of Yan, throwing the Tang realm into a state of war and confusion. Yuan Zai fled to the region south of the Yangtze River during the war. Li Xiyan (ÊùéÂ∏åË®Ä), the surveyor of Jiangdong Circuit (Ê±üÊù±, i.e., the region southeast of the Yangtze) commissioned Yuan as his deputy and the prefect of Hong Prefecture (Ê¥™Â∑û, in modern Nanchang, Jiangxi). After Emperor Xuanzong's son and successor Emperor Suzong recaptured the capital Chang'an and Luoyang from Yan forces, Yuan was recalled to the imperial government to serve as a junior official at the ministry of census (Êà∂ÈÉ®, Hubu). When he met Emperor Suzong, Emperor Suzong was impressed by his quick thinking, and gave him several responsibilities‚Äîdeputy minister of census (Êà∂ÈÉ®‰æçÈÉé, Hubu Shilang), deputy chief imperial censor (Âæ°Âè≤‰∏≠‰∏û, Yushi Zhongcheng), and the director of financial matters of the Yangtze-Huai River region. Believing that the Yangtze-Huai region was still comparably wealthy compared to the rest of the realm, Yuan taxed the region heavily to replenish the imperial treasuries, sometimes taxing as much as 80% to 90% of the people's assets, leading to much flight and banditry in the region.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 222. Meanwhile, Yuan began a close association with the powerful eunuch Li Fuguo, through Li Fuguo's wife Lady Yuan,It was customary at the time for powerful eunuchs to marry notwithstanding their eunuch status. who was a clanswoman of Yuan Zai's. In 762, at Li Fuguo's recommendation, Yuan was named the mayor of the special municipality that included Chang'an, Jingzhao Municipality (‰∫¨ÂÖÜ). Yuan then met Li Fuguo and earnestly declined the post‚Äîand Li Fuguo understood this to mean that he wanted an office higher than being the mayor of Jingzhao. The next day, when the chancellor Xiao Hua was removed from his office, Yuan was given the designation of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (Âêå‰∏≠Êõ∏ÈñÄ‰∏ãÂπ≥Á´†‰∫ã), making him a chancellor de facto. He also continued to be in charge of financial matters.  During Emperor Daizong's reign  Emperor Suzong died later that year, and after a bloody struggle between Emperor Suzong's wife Empress Zhang and Li Fuguo (in which Empress Zhang and a son of Emperor Suzong's, Li Xi (Êùé‰øÇ) the Prince of Yue, were killed), Emperor Suzong's son and crown prince Li Yu became emperor (as Emperor Daizong). For a while, Li Fuguo had even greater powerful than before. Yuan Zai continued to serve as chancellor and, knowing that Li Fuguo resented Xiao Hua (whom he blamed for blocking his path to chancellorship), Yuan made false accusations against Xiao, leading to Xiao's exile. Yuan was soon made Zhongshu Shilang (‰∏≠Êõ∏‰æçÈÉé), the deputy head of the legislative bureau of government (‰∏≠Êõ∏ÁúÅ, Zhongshu Sheng), and continued to serve as chancellor. He was also created the Viscount of Xuchang. In 763, during a surprise attack by forces of the Tibetan Empire against Chang'an (which forced Emperor Daizong to flee to Shan Prefecture (ÈôùÂ∑û, in modern Sanmenxia, Henan), Emperor Daizong made the general Guo Ziyi the supreme commander of Tang forces in the Guanzhong region and made Yuan Guo's military advisor. When Emperor Daizong returned to Chang'an that year, the official Yan Zhenqing proposed that he offer sacrifices at the imperial ancestral tombs and temple first, before returning to the palace. Yuan refused to endorse Yan's proposal, and Yan, exasperated, stated, \\"How can you, lord chancellor, continue to harm the government?\\" This led Yuan to be resentful toward Yan. Meanwhile, when Emperor Daizong removed Miao Jinqing and Pei Zunqing from their chancellor posts after returning to Chang'an, it was said that Yuan became even more powerful. He bribed Emperor Daizong's eunuch attendant Dong Xiu (Ëë£ÁßÄ) and had his subordinate Zhuo Yingqian (ÂçìËã±ÂÄ©) serve as a liaison to Dong. Through Dong and Zhuo, he was able to keep a close watch on what Emperor Daizong's opinions were and were able to agree with Emperor Daizong's opinions closely, thus drawing greater favor from the emperor. As he was finding the financial affairs too overwhelming for him to handle in addition to the chancellor duties, he transferred his financial affairs duties to his friend Liu Yan. It was said that by this point, Yuan was exceedingly powerful, and his wife Lady Wang (a daughter of the deceased general Wang Zhongsi) and his sons were abusing power. Meanwhile, though, with Li Fuguo (who was assassinated late in 762 by Emperor Daizong's orders, probably with Yuan's assistance) and Cheng Yuanzhen having successively been removed, Yu Chao'en had become a powerful eunuch, and he and Yuan did not get along with each other, and while the two did not openly dispute with each other, for the next several years, the power struggle between them would be a strong undercurrent in Tang court politics. In 765, when the Tibetan Empire sent emissaries to propose peace with Tang, Emperor Daizong had Yuan and fellow chancellor Du Hongjian meet with them to swear peace. In 766, with Yuan being very powerful and fearing that people would submit secret accusations to Emperor Daizong against him, he proposed that before officials could submit letters to the emperor, they must first receive approval from their superiors‚Äîthus hoping to cut off this avenue of secret submissions. Yan, then the minister of justice, vehemently opposed, pointing out that this would lead to the rise of another Li Linfu‚Äîwho used similar methods to block off criticism against him during his service as Emperor Xuanzong's chancellor. Yuan, already resentful of Yan, accused Yan of defamation and had Yan exiled. Later that year, when Yu, during a lecture on the I Ching, tried to satirize the chancellors by talking about how a ding (a large cooking vessel often used to symbolize chancellorship) would overturn if imbalanced, Yuan's fellow chancellor Wang Jin, was visibly incensed, but Yuan remained calm and pleasant, leading Yu to comment, \\"It is common for the target to get angry, but one who remains smiling needs to be paid attention to even more carefully.\\"Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 224. By 767, it was said that Emperor Daizong, Yuan, Wang, and Du were all devout in Buddhism, with Wang particularly so. With the emperor and the chancellors leading the way, the populace was also largely devoutly Buddhist‚Äîso much so that the energy of the government and the people were spent on worshiping, not on affairs of the state. In 768, with the Tibetan Empire continuing to carry out incursions on a yearly basis, Yuan came up with a solution‚Äîas he believed that at that time, the only major army on the Tibetan border, commanded by the general Ma Lin (È¶¨Áíò), was inadequate to defend against Tibetan attacks. He proposed that Ma's army be moved from Bin (ÈÇ†Â∑û, in modern Xianyang) and Ning (ÂØßÂ∑û, in modern Qingyang, Gansu) to Jing Prefecture (Ê∂áÂ∑û, in modern Pingliang, Gansu), while the stronger army under Guo's command, then at Hezhong (Ê≤≥‰∏≠, in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi) be moved to Bin Prefecture. To alleviate fears that the border prefectures, then laid fallow by the wars with Tibetan forces, would be inadequate to supply this large army, Yuan committed to sending revenues from the interior prefectures to supply it. Meanwhile, he tried to sow seeds of suspicion between Guo and Yu, but was unable to do so. In 769, with Du having died, Yuan recommended an old superior, the senior official Pei Mian, who had also recommended him before, to be chancellor. Pei, however, would die shortly after himself. In 770, with Emperor Daizong's patience about Yu's hold on the imperial guards‚Äîwith which Yu was able to dominate the Chang'an region‚Äîfinally wearing thin, Yuan secretly conferred with Emperor Daizong and persuaded Emperor Daizong to act against Yu. Yuan bribed two close associates of Yu's‚Äîthe guard commander Zhou Hao (Âë®Áöì) and the general Huangfu Wen (ÁöáÁî´Ê∫´)‚Äîand was able to get full grasp of Yu's activities. In spring 770, at Yuan's suggestion, Emperor Daizong carried out several moves that were intending to be preludes to eliminating Yu‚Äîmoving the general Li Baoyu from being the military governor (Jiedushi) of Fengxiang Circuit (È≥≥Áøî, headquartered in modern Baoji) to Shannan West Circuit (Â±±ÂçóË•øÈÅì, headquartered in modern Xi'an, Shaanxi, to the southwest of Chang'an), while moving Huangfu, then the military governor of Shan Circuit (headquartered in modern Sanmenxia) to Fengxiang‚Äîwhile allaying Yu's suspicions by transferring control of four counties near Chang'an to the imperial guards, under Yu's command. (Yuan's intent was that, as Huangfu arrived in Chang'an, to use his soldiers against Yu.) Soon, when Huangfu arrived in Chang'an, Yuan laid a trap for Yu with Huangfu's and Zhou's soldiers, and at a secret meeting between Emperor Daizong and Yu, Yuan and Emperor Daizong acted and killed Yu. After Yu's death, Yuan became even more powerful and corrupt. He also became extremely confident of his own abilities, and was living luxuriously, beyond his means. With Yang Wan the deputy minister of civil service affairs not willing to bow to his wishes in determining official commissions, he made Yang the principal of the imperial university and replaced him with a corrupt official, Xu Hao (ÂæêÊµ©), who followed his orders. Emperor Daizong by now had heard about Yuan's corruption, but wanted to maintain a good relationship with him. He therefore several times personally urged Yuan to curb his ways, but Yuan could not change his ways, beginning to cause him to lose Emperor Daizong's favor. In 771, Emperor Daizong, without seeking Yuan's concurrence and without foreknowledge on Yuan's part, named the official Li Qiyun (ÊùéÊ†ñÁ≠†) the chief imperial censor. It was said that this marked the beginning of the fall of Yuan's power. Indeed, in 773, after Li Qiyun indicted several of Yuan's associates‚ÄîXu Hao, Xue Yong (ËñõÈÇï), Du Ji (ÊùúÊøü), and Yu Shao (‰∫éÂä≠) -- causing them to be demoted out of the capital, it was said that corruption became somewhat curbed at court. Meanwhile, though, Yuan was working on another military project‚Äîproposing that Yuan Prefecture (ÂéüÂ∑û, in modern Guyuan, Ningxia) -- formerly Tang territory, but now in a no-man's land between Tang and the Tibetan Empire, with neither side guarding it‚Äîbe rebuilt; that Ma's forces be moved from Jing Prefecture to Yuan Prefecture; and that Guo's forces be moved from Bin Prefecture to Jing Prefecture; and that these posts then be used as bases of further forward advances against the Tibetan Empire. Emperor Daizong consulted with the general Tian Shen'gong (Áî∞Á•ûÂäü) about this plan, and Tian responded, \\"Battling and judging the status of enemies is difficult even for well-seasoned generals. Why would Your Imperial Majesty listen to a civilian and put the entire realm's forces under his control?\\" Emperor Daizong thus tabled Yuan's proposal. In 777, with Emperor Daizong finally tired of corruption on Yuan's and Wang Jin's part, he secretly planned with his uncle, the general Wu Cou (Âê≥Êπä), to eliminate Yuan and Wang. On May 10, Emperor Daizong ordered Wu to arrest Yuan, Wang, and their associates. He then had Liu Yan, then the minister of civil service affairs, and Li Han (ÊùéÊ∂µ) the chief imperial censor interrogate them. Yuan and Wang admitted their guilt, and Yuan was ordered to commit suicide, while Wang was exiled. Instead of committing suicide, Yuan stated to the executioner, \\"Please let me die quickly.\\" The executioner responded, \\"Lord chancellor, if you wish to die quickly, then you have to suffer some humiliation. Please pardon me.\\" The executioner took his socks off and stuffed them into Yuan's mouth, and then executed Yuan.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 225. Yuan's wife Lady Wang, as well as his sons Yuan Bohe (ÂÖÉ‰ºØÂíå), Yuan Zhongwu (ÂÖÉ‰ª≤Ê≠¶), and Yuan Ji'neng (ÂÖÉÂ≠£ËÉΩ), were all executed. His family tombs and temples were destroyed, and his assets were confiscated. It was said that Yuan had large storages of pepper (then an exceedingly expensive spice) as well as gold, silver, and other treasures. Only his daughter Yuan Zhenyi (ÂÖÉÁúü‰∏Ä), then already a Buddhist nun, was spared, but she was confiscated to be a servant inside the palace. (She was not told of her father's fate, and she did not find out until the reign of Emperor Daizong's son and successor Emperor Dezong.) A large number of Yuan's associates, including Yang Yan (whom Yuan had fostered as a potential successor), Han Hui (ÈüìÊ¥Ñ), Bao Ji (ÂåÖ‰Ω∂), and Han Hui (ÈüìÊúÉ), were demoted. Yuan's title had been promoted to Duke of Yingchuan some- when before his death. After Emperor Daizong died in 778 and was succeeded by Emperor Dezong, Emperor Dezong remembered that Yuan was involved in his being named crown prince. In 784, he posthumously restored Yuan's titles and offices and permitted him to be reburied properly. Yuan's subordinates Xu Chu (Ë®±Âàù), Yang Jiao (Ê•äÁöé), and Ji Tao (Á¥ÄÊÖÜ) paid out of their pockets to rebury Yuan. Yuan was also given the posthumous name of Huang (Ëçí, meaning \\"performer of illegal acts\\"), later changed to the slightly less derogatory Chengzong (ÊàêÁ∏±, meaning \\"successful but unvirtuous\\"). During the reign of Emperor Wenzong of Tang, an official named Yan Houben (Âö¥ÂéöÊú¨) suggested that the posthumous name of Yuan changed to Zhong (meaning \\"loyal\\"), insisting that despite his great corruption, Yuan had the great achievement of protecting Emperor Dezong when he was the Crown Prince of Emperor Daizong; and his suggestion was approved.

She discovered a legal prostitution system within the Islamic regime. She reported child marriages, and interviewed approximately 200 women. When Kazan returned to her country she published her book Tahran Melekleri (Legal Prostitution) (The Angels of Tehran), which was about Nikah mut‚Äòah. Kazan received various threats after publication, although her book has become a bestseller in Turkey. Kazan's book Sia Islamic Prostution was the first book about temporary marriage. Kazan visited many Middle Eastern countries where she recorded information, and has dedicated her work to saving women across the Middle East from the Sharia Law. In 2008, Kazan married Giacinto Licursi, an Italian lawyer and politician, and she subsequently moved to Rome. There she actively promoted Secularism in Islam, prevention of child marriages and woman trafficking on different platforms including Italian TV channels.

Kazan launched a global campaign in 2014 named This Is Not My Allah against Islamic Terrorism with French political analyst Alain Wagner in New York City. The campaign was meant to represent a voice and break the silence of Muslims who feared speaking out against radical Islam. In 2015, Rabia Kazan endorsed Donald Trump because of his statement about radical Islam. In 2016, she joined NDC TRUMP (National Diversity Coalition for Trump) as executive. In 2016, Kazan gave an interview to CNN News, \\"Islamic Regime hates America,\\" in which she spoke about her opinion and how she believes that the way Trump is handling the issue is correct and how moderate Muslims need to stand up against radical Islam.

The company is currently owned by Freeland Yachtspars Limited and has exchanged hands several times since it was founded by Frank Collar (F.Collar) in 1932.  The early days  The business of F.Collar Ltd was started in 1932 by Mr Frank Collar who was at the time trained in accountancy but had always been a keen rower. Based in the old Oxford University Boathouse situated at the bottom of Isis Street, he began by repairing damaged oars for college crews. With demand high a few weeks later he was joined by his father along with a 14-year-old by the name of Bill Scaldwell who was taken on as an apprentice. With the growing popularity of rowing it was not long after that an order was received for the manufacture of six pairs of Sculls, starting the business of oar making. A small quantity of wood was purchased and with limited tools and no machines, they were made by hand, and in the absence of electricity they were varnished by candlelight. The business progressed and orders grew for new sets of rowing blades for not only the Oxford University crews but also other schools and colleges throughout the country including the Cambridge University teams. By the time the Second World War broke out the Collar reputation was sufficiently established for Frank to secure a contract with the Air Ministry to make oars for all aircraft lifeboats.  Ministry of Defence contract  Winning a contract with the Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom) (MOD) is marked as a turning point in the company history due to the vast quantity of oars ordered and as a result additional staff, machines and premises had to be found. While the oars for the Air Ministry were in production the Royal Navy approached Collars to design a paddle to be used in invasion. It had to be able to enter the water as quietly as possible yet strong enough to do the job. A design for the 5‚Äô Paddle was submitted, accepted and thousands were ordered. The contract required a nearly 24-hour production schedule to meet the deadline. Today there is still an enabling contract in place with the MOD and the same paddle, along with certain oars are still being produced by Collars in Oxford.  Yacht masts  In 1950 Frank Collar and Bill Scaldwell joined in partnership and this was shortly followed by the boom in sailing which took F. Collar into the manufacturing of yacht and dinghy masts in a big way. With the chosen timber of Sitka Spruce being used in both oars and masts, and a very similar manufacturing process, this was a natural progression. By the time of the 1968 Mexico Olympics Collars were commissioned to supply all the masts for the popular Finn Class dinghy,F Collar Ltd supplied oars for all the Olympic Games between 1952 and 1984 and with wood being a varying natural material, 100 masts were made and the 50 most similar masts were chosen and taken to competition.  Accolades  The Collar racing oars have been exported to every Western Country as well as regularly exported to Australia, New Zealand and America. Used in every Olympic games from 1952 to 1984 as well as international competitions. In 1970 two pairs of sculls were supplied to Sidney Genders and were used to successfully row the Atlantic, later followed by Chay Blyth and John Ridgway (sailor).  The present day  Collars led the field of oar making until early 1980 when modern advances resulted in the introduction of a carbon fibre oar. Pioneered by the Dreissigacker brothers the new material provided a lighter and stronger oar, and by 1985 regular orders had dried up. Still providing recreational, specialist sculls and oars Collars were to move their primary focus to the yachting market that had been steadily growing in the background. With a change of hands and ownership the Collar brand is currently owned by Freeland Yacht Spar Limited based in Dorchester on Thames near Oxford, where a staff of 13 still produce wooden oars, masts and spars for yachts from all round the world.  Products  At present the company hand manufactures Masts and Spars for Yachts as well as a broad selection of standard and specialist wooden oars. Recently, the company has begun specialising in hand crafted Flag Poles.

The sound producing diaphragm may be a metal cone as in the Stroh violin or a mica sheet as in the instruments made by A. T. Howson, London and the Stroviols company of Britain. The sound generated by the vibrations from the string or strings are transferred through the bridge to a connecting arm into the center of the diaphragm within the reproducer. The vibrating column of air is then directed into one or several horns. On 4 May 1899, Johannes Matthias Augustus Stroh applied for a patent in Great Britain, GB9418 titled Improvements in Violins and other Stringed Instruments which was accepted on 24 March 1900. This described the use of a flat metal (other materials are also mentioned) diaphragm in the voice-box (reproducer) of a violin to mechanically amplify the sound. Then on 16 February 1901 he applied for a second Great British patent, GB3393 titled '. Which was accepted on 14 December 1901. This effectively extended the first concept to now use a conical resonator with corrugations at its edge, allowing a more 'rigid' diaphragm. His failure to register his inventions in the USA allowed John Dopyera and Geo Beauchamp to subsequently obtain US patents for the tricone and single cone designs used in National brand instruments. The use of a phonograph reproducer with mica Isinglass diaphragms allowed the cost of production to be reduced. Phonofiddles had a brief period of popularity as studio instruments for acoustic recording of phonograph records as the energy of the sound could be directed into the collection horn of the recording equipment.

In addition, he was influential in the creation of catalytic converters for automobiles. Life Haensel was born 1 September 1914 in Freiburg, Germany, but grew up in Moscow where his father Paul Haensel was a university professor of economics. He emigrated to the US in 1930 when his father took up an academic position. He received a BS degree in general engineering from Northwestern University, and a Master's in chemical engineering from Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1937, joining the Universal Oil Products Company (UOP) the same year. While there he worked for a Ph.D. in chemistry from Northwestern University, which was awarded in 1941. Following World War II, Dr. Haensel went to Europe under the auspices of the U.S. Petroleum Administration for War to evaluate German research on synthetic fuels. In UOP he progressed to become vice-president and director of research (1969) and vice-president for science and technology (1972‚Äì79). In 1980 he became professor of chemical engineering at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, a position he held until his death, on 15 December 2002. He was survived by his wife, Hertha Skala Haensel. Work Haensel worked on surface catalysts, patenting various methods for improving chemical processes in the oil industry. Platinum was known to chemists as a catalyst, but was considered too expensive for industrial use. Haensel, however, understood that only the surface mattered, so produced ceramic supports with tiny amounts of platinum metal on the surface, eventually showing that 0.01% could be effective. It has since been realised that the platinum was in the form of nanoparticles, long before this idea was common. The metal combined with the acid surface of alumina to carry out two chemical processes, resulting in the production of gasoline with a higher octane rating. At that time, octane rating was improved by the addition of anti-knock agents such as tetraethyllead. The development of the platforming process allowed the eventual removal of lead from gasoline. In addition, hydrogen was produced, which was valuable in itself but also helped to remove sulfur, giving a cleaner, more environmentally friendly process. Furthermore, the catalyst produced aromatic compounds such as benzene, valuable for the chemical industry and the developing plastics industry. Thus Haensel had a major impact on three industries, and on the US economy. This was recognised in his receipt of the first National Academy of Sciences Award for Chemistry in Service to Society, 1981, \\"For his outstanding research in the catalytic reforming of hydrocarbons, that has greatly enhanced the economic value of our petroleum natural resources\\".National Academy of Sciences Awards In the 1950s the source of photochemical smog was established as automobile exhaust emissions. In his senior position in UOP, from 1956 to 1974, Haensel directed the research programs which led to catalytic converters. He was the inventor or co-inventor of 145 US patents. In his later years (1981‚Äì1998), Haensel was an educator, encouraging undergraduates and postgraduates while remaining in touch with industry as a part-time consultant. His success was shown by receiving the Chancellor's Outstanding Teacher Award of the University of Massachusetts.

It is based on the novel The Disorientated Man by 'Peter Saxon', a house pseudonym used by various authors in the 1960s and 1970s. It marks the second teaming, after The Oblong Box, of actors Price and Lee with director Gordon Hessler. Price and Lee only share a brief scene in the film's climax. Cushing, in his brief scene, shares no screen time with either Price or Lee. Although the film's title, and association with stars Price, Lee and Cushing, might suggest a violent horror film, the violence in the film is mostly understated and/or off-screen, while the plot owes more to films like Invasion of the Body Snatchers or 1970's era 'conspiracy thrillers' like The Parallax View. Overlooked during its initial release, the film has since become a minor cult classic, with the Overlook Film Guide acknowledging it as: \\"one of the best science-fiction films made in Britain.\\"  Plot  The movie's structure is fragmented, as it alternates between three distinguishable plot threads. A man jogging through suburban London grabs his heart, and collapses. He wakes up in a hospital bed. The nurse tending him gives him water. She leaves. He pulls down the bed covers to discover that his lower right leg has been amputated. He screams. Elsewhere, intelligence operative Konartz (Marshall Jones) returns to his home country, an unidentified Eastern European totalitarian state. Upon being debriefed by a superior officer, Konartz steps around the table and places a hand on the other man's shoulder, paralyzing and thereby killing him. Back in London, MPS Detective Superintendent Bellaver (Alfred Marks) investigates the deaths of several young women in the city. The women, picked up at nightclubs by Keith (Michael Gothard), have apparently been killed by the same individual, and some of the bodies have been drained of blood. The centerpiece of the movie is a nearly fifteen minutes long police - murder suspect car-chase/foot-chase sequence through suburban London. Vincent Price plays Dr. Browning, whose clinic specializes in limb and organ transplantation. Christopher Lee plays Fremont, the head of Britain's (unnamed) intelligence services. Peter Cushing plays Major Benedek, an official in the Eastern European country; a very brief cameo role. The three plotlines converge in a chilling and unexpected climax.  Cast  * Vincent Price as Dr. Browning * Christopher Lee as Fremont * Peter Cushing as Benedek * Judy Huxtable as Sylvia * Alfred Marks as Detective Superintendent Bellaver * Michael Gothard as Keith * Anthony Newlands as Ludwig * Peter Sallis as Schweitz * Uta Levka as Jane * Christopher Matthews as Dr. David Sorel * Judy Bloom as Helen Bradford * Clifford Earl as Detective Sergeant Jimmy Joyce * Kenneth Benda as Professor Kingsmill * Marshall Jones as Konratz * Yutte Stensgaard as Erika * Julian Holloway as Detective Constable Griffin * Nigel Lambert as Ken Sparten * Amen Corner as themselves Production The movie is based on Peter Saxon's science fiction novel The Disorientated Man. For the most part, the movie follows the novel quite closely. In the novel, the antagonists turned out to be aliens. According to an interview with Christopher Lee, the characters were indeed going to be revealed as aliens in the movie's climax, but all connections to that fact were cut out of the movie before it was released, leaving the enigmatic villains' backgrounds unexplained. Rights to the novel were bought by Milton Subotsky of Amicus Productions who got financing from Louis Heyward head of European operations for AIP. There was a script by Subotsky but it was regarded as unplayable.All's Well That Ends: an interview with Chris Wicking Monthly Film Bulletin; London Vol. 55, Iss. 658, (Nov 1, 1988): 322. Gordon Hessler says he got Chris Wickling to heavily rewrite it: > That was really a pulp book, a throwaway book that you read on a train. > There was nothing in it, just empty pieces of action. But it was Chris who > gave it a whole new level by using it as a political process of what might > happen in the future. That is what made the picture, he's the one that came > up with all those ideas, yet he still managed to keep the nuances of the > sort of pulp fiction novel.George G. Reis, \\"An Interview with Gordon > Hessler\\", DVD Drive In accessed 27 February 2014 The eponymous theme song for the film was by Amen Corner, who appeared in the film singing it. This was one of their last appearances before Andy Fairweather Low departed for a solo career after a brief career as Fair Weather. This marked the first time that horror-movie icons Peter Cushing, Vincent Price and Christopher Lee appeared in the same feature-film. The three actors however, do not share screen space. Cushing does not appear with either Lee or Price - only appearing in a cameo. Lee and Price share a brief scene towards the film's climax. The film was made in the span of a month, starting on 5 May 1969 at Shepperton, having location work done at Trafalagar Square and Chertsey, Surrey. Though the film has a release date of 1970, the copyright lists 1969. Judy Huxtable is billed as a \\"guest star\\". An episode of The X-Files, Kill Switch, depicts Agent Fox Mulder in a virtual reality experience during which, like this film's victim, nurses periodically amputate his limbs while he sleeps. Reception Reviews from critics were mixed. Howard Thompson of The New York Times wrote that the film \\"tools along intriguingly for a while with some genuine possibilities before taking a nosedive\\" when it \\"ends up in still another mad scientist's lair.\\" Variety wrote that the script \\"has almost as many holes as the assorted victims of the action. However, such criticism is completely irrelevant to the film's gripping momentum of horror.\\" Roger Ebert gave the film two stars out of four, calling it \\"ridiculous\\" yet \\"impossible to dislike because they ask only that you share their sense of the absurd. The fascinating thing about this one is that it makes absolutely no sense at all until maybe the last 10 minutes. None.\\" Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film one star, calling it \\"a violent and sick film ... that begs to be included in our annual worst twenty list.\\"Siskel, Gene (February 18, 1970). \\"Scream Again\\". Chicago Tribune. Section 2, p. 5. Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times called the film \\"a superb piece of contemporary horror, a science fiction tale possessed of a credibility more terrifying than any of the Gothic witchery of 'Rosemary's Baby' ... It's one of those movies where you have no idea what's going on until the end, but once there, there's no letdown.\\"Thomas, Kevin (February 21, 1970). \\"'Scream Again' Scary Science Fiction Tale\\". Los Angeles Times. Part II, p. 9. On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 64% based on 14 reviews, with an average rating of 5.45 out of 10.

History One of the oldest buildings in La Fatarella was a Muslim watchtower in the site where the chapel of Mare de D√©u of the Miseric√≤rdia stands today. The name of the population is derived from the Arab name for \\"tower\\", although there are other etymological theories. They are no visible remains of the tower. From the point where it stood there is a commanding view of the Terra Alta and a magnificent panoramic view. The Fatarella has irregular and winding streets that present an architectonic element locally known as perxes, which are sections of a street being covered by envigats, or stone arcs, that unite several houses. The origins of the Fatarella present town is medieval, as the facades of many houses show, having porticoes of stone with thresholds carved with different symbols and inscriptions. During the Middle Ages the town was walled to offer protection for its inhabitants, mainly from brigands and wolves. The walls are between in width. This defensive system continued until well into the 17th century, when the a population boom forced the city to expand beyond the walls. Nowadays, vestiges of these walls can still be seen, from which access doors on the enclosure can be deduced. La Fatarella, especially neighboring Serra de la Fatarella mountain range, was one of the main scenarios of the Battle of the Ebro in the Spanish Civil War. A monument to commemorate the victims was erected in 2010. References * Varios (1989), Gu√≠a de Catalunya. Todos los pueblos y todas las comarcas. .

Riders sit in a round bowl with no seatbelts or restraints. There are bars behind the riders which they hold on to. The ride starts to spin, the music starts playing and pneumatic arms bounce the riders up and down. The Tagada is operated by a human operator who will synchronize the bounces with the music beat. Most operators give time for riders to get to their seats again before making the ride bounce (this occurs if turbulence is too strong). Sometimes riders will be told the ride is over and the gates will not open and the operator will restart the ride making everyone fall over and then open the gates. Tagada rides are often associated with injuries over 2560 injured per year including ejections from the ride, such as 20 June 2011 in Newcastle, or during the 2008 British Grand Prix or October 2009, or most recently in 2016 in Ayr, Scotland where three riders got launched from the ride. Most injuries are broken bones of riders who fall into the middle of the ride. Many street fairs ban tagada rides due to their generally poor safety records and cleanliness.

By this we mean that the diminutive star has the same tribulations that she has encountered so many times in the celluloid... These plot high-lights have been incorporated into nearly every picture starring Miss Minter. They will probably continue to form the foundation of Minter releases, because these circumstances are ideal for displaying the star's youth, wistfulness, and engaging mannerisms. The public would probably resent seeing Miss Minter in a different kind of role, just as it wants Maude Adams to play nothing but Peter Pan.\\" Proving the Motion Picture News critic correct, the Dayton, Ohio Journal review objected to Minter's hairstyle: \\"Give us back our Mary. In The Gentle Intruder, Mary is no longer the laughing care-free child. She has her hair done up. Lord! fancy Mary Miles with done up hair. We refuse to stand for it.

Born in Waterford, Byrne first arrived on the inter-county scene at the age of fifteen when he first linked up with the Waterford minor team, before later joining the senior side. He made his senior debut during the 1931 championship. Byrne immediately became a regular member of the starting fifteen, before later playing with Kilkenny, and won one All-Ireland medal, one Leinster medal and one Munster medal. He was an All-Ireland runner-up on two occasions. As a member of the Munster and Leinster inter-provincial teams on a number of occasions, Byrne won one Railway Cup medal. At club level he played with Ferrybank, Slieverue, Mooncoin and Mount Sion, winning several championship medals. Biography Loughlin Byrne was born in the Glen area of Waterford in 1913.\\"Ireland Civil Registration Indexes, 1845-1958,\\" database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:FBTR-84X : accessed 17 November 2015), BIRTHS entry for James Loughlin Byrne; citing Waterford, Jul - Sep 1913, vol. 4, p. 580, General Registry, Custom House, Dublin; FHL microfilm 101,075. The son of a railyard worker called James \\"Dashy\\" Byrne, he was raised in Ferrybank on the Waterford-Kilkenny border. Playing career Club Byrne played his club hurling with a number of clubs in both Waterford and Kilkenny. As a player with Ferrybank, in 1928, he won a minor Waterford Minor Hurling Championship title. Byrne later joined the Mooncoin GAA club in Kilkenny. Here he captured a senior Kilkenny Senior Hurling Championship in 1936. He also lined out with Slieverue during this period. Byrne later joined the Mount Sion GAA club in Waterford city and shared in some of that club's victories. He won his first senior Waterford Senior Hurling Championship with Mount Sion in 1938. It was the first of three consecutive county titles as Byrne collected two more county medals in 1939 and 1940. Inter-county Byrne first joined the Waterford minor hurling team in the late 1920s. He was only fifteen years-old when he won a Munster Minor Hurling Championship title in 1929 following a 7-5 to 0-2 thrashing of Tipperary. Waterford later qualified for the All-Ireland final where Meath provided the opposition. Waterford won by 5-0 to 1-1 giving Byrne an All- Ireland Minor Hurling Championship medal. Byrne was later drafted onto the Waterford senior hurling panel. He was only seventeen when he played in the 1931 Munster final with Cork providing the opposition. In eight minutes of injury time, Cork scored an equalising point and the game ended in a draw. The replay was more conclusive as Cork won by 5-4 to 1-2, ending Waterford's championship campaign. By the mid-1930s Byrne had crossed the border and was playing with the Kilkenny senior inter-county team. He played in the Leinster decider of 1934, however, Dublin were the winners on that occasion. The following year Byrne was still on the team as Kilkenny defeated Laois to take the Leinster title. Byrne later lined out in his first All-Ireland final at senior level. Limerick provided the opposition on that occasion and were favourites to win. They were the reigning National League and All-Ireland champions and had played a remarkable 31 games without defeat. A record crowd of over 46,000 turned up to watch the game. At the beginning of the second- half Lory Meagher sent over a huge point from midfield giving Kilkenny a lead which they wouldn't surrender. As a result of this victory, Byrne collected an All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship medal. By 1938 Byrne was back on the Waterford senior team. That year his side reached the Munster final with Clare providing the opposition. In a close game Waterford emerged as the victors on a score line of 3-5 to 2-5. Not only was it Byrne's first Munster Senior Hurling Championship medal, but it was also the first time that Waterford had won the provincial title. Waterford later accounted for Galway allowing Byrne's side to advance to their first-ever All-Ireland final. Dublin provided the opposition on that occasion. Declan Goode scored a goal for the Decies after just six minutes, however, Dublin fought back with goals of their own. Eventually, victory went to Dublin on a score line of 2-5 to 1-6. Death In 1940 Byrne got injured playing a club match against Portlaw and came off with a coat wrapped around himself. He sat in the wet grass on the sideline for the remainder of the game and, as a result, contracted tuberculosis. His health steadily declined over the next few months and on 19 January 1941 he died in a Dublin hospital. He was only twenty-seven years old.The Unconquerable Keane: John Keane and the rise of Waterford hurling by David Smith, Published by Original Writing, Dublin Ltd. 2010 (www.originalwriting.ie) Teams References 1913 births 1941 deaths Ferrybank hurlers Erin's Own hurlers (Waterford) Mooncoin hurlers Slieverue hurlers Mount Sion hurlers Kilkenny inter-county hurlers Waterford inter-county hurlers All- Ireland Senior Hurling Championship winners ","title":"Locky Byrne"},{"id":"19203342","text":"Aril Snorre Edvardsen (15 November 1938 - 6 September 2008) was a Norwegian evangelical preacher and missionary.

It contains a live performance recorded at the Crocodile Rock in Allentown, Pennsylvania on July 18, 2008. The album was released on October 21, 2008, through Hot Topic locations in the United States and on website Interpunk.com, in a two-disc format with recordings of the live performance on CD and DVD. The album was inspired by a video clip featuring television personality Bill O'Reilly. In an outtake from Inside Edition popularized on the Internet, O'Reilly shouts \\"Fuck it, we'll do it live!\\" after becoming frustrated by a last-minute alteration to the show's teleprompter text. The band members watched the video clip of this incident repeatedly and decided that it was emblematic of how they wanted to record a live show ‚Äì without overdubbing in post-production. Personnel in the group for the live show included Wednesday 13 on vocals and guitar, Jason Trioxin on guitar, Nate Manor on bass, and Jonny Chops on drums. Fuck It, We'll Do It Live received a generally positive reception from music critics. Metal Storm reviewed the release and described the album as an ideal introduction to Wednesday 13, comparing the style of music to glam punk. Metal Ireland recommended the music for its simple, B-movie quality. Global Domination wrote that the album broke the trend of inadvisable purchases of live performances. The release received favorable reviews from Metal.de and MusicWaves; the latter compared the album's style to that of Alice Cooper and Marilyn Manson. The Swedish-language review site Hallowed.se found the recording to be unexciting.

In an outtake from Inside Edition popularized on the Internet, O'Reilly shouts \\"Fuck it, we'll do it live!\\" after becoming frustrated by a last-minute alteration to the show's teleprompter text. Wednesday 13 explained the album's inspiration in an interview: \\"Wednesday 13 (the band) has a live DVD that I put out and we couldn't think of a title and we were driving down the road thinking, we are going to have to come up with a name for it. The live titles, you have to put something like that. So, we were watching Bill O'Reilly and we kept listening to him say, 'Fuck it, we'll do it live.' That's kind of how quick we threw that DVD together. We didn't know we were putting it together like 4 days before so we were like, 'fuck it, we'll do it live.' We didn't do any overdubs on it, everybody in the band was sick and we just went with it.\\" Live recording The exterior of Crocodile Rock in Allentown, Pennsylvania, where the album was recorded. Fuck It, We'll Do It Live was recorded live on July 18, 2008, at the Crocodile Rock nightclub in Allentown, Pennsylvania. Personnel in the group for the live show included Wednesday 13 on vocals and guitar, Jason Trioxin on guitar, Nate Manor on bass, and Jonny Chops on drums. Wednesday 13 explained that he had been in a motor vehicle accident in September 2007 and had fractured his clavicle, and had subsequently decided to expand the band from four to five members. By the time of the live recording, he had healed sufficiently to both perform as frontman and play guitar, and the band was reduced back to its normal size of four members. This was Wednesday 13's first live album. In an interview with SF Weekly, Wednesday 13 spoke about his touring band. \\"This is like my favorite lineup that I've ever had, and I've definitely had members come and go for many different reasons over the years.\\" The video of the performance was recorded using six cameras. At brief times during the performance, the video recorded a moment of white on camera or a dark screen, both of which were related to the use of strobe lights. An individual dressed in costume as Friday the 13th character Jason Voorhees made an appearance on-stage at one point during the performance. Post-production No post-production overdubbing was done in the studio. Occasional wrong notes can be heard in the final product of the recording. Wednesday 13 admitted, \\"First off, let me say this is a live recording. This is not a live recording where we went back into the studio and overdubbed guitar parts or vocals. This is us ... LIVE! If we make a mistake, you will hear it. If my voice cracks, you hear it. This is as close to a live experience as we could give.\\" Release The album was released on October 21, 2008, timed to coincide with Halloween. The album was made available as a two-disc set, with audio tracks on one in CD format and video recording of the live performance on the other in DVD format. The DVD contains a live video recording of the performance, without special features or DVD extras. The packaging also included a 20-panel booklet featuring photographs of the group performing, taken by their fans.

Reception Metal Storm reviewed the DVD recording of the live performance and called it \\"a perfect way to discover the music of Wednesday 13 that I could describe as a mix of Glam with Punk\\". Justin Donnelly reviewed the album for The Metal Forge and wrote favorably about the DVD portion: \\"Shot with six cameras, Fuck It, We'll Do It Live is a raw and honest representation of Wednesday 13 live in concert\\". A review by Metal Rage was critical of the DVD, but praised the audio on the CD: \\"All in all I definitely recommend the CD, 'cause you get a nice representative image of what a good Wednesday 13 show sounds like.\\" D√≥nal McBrien gave the performance 3.8 stars out of 5 in a review for Metal Ireland writing: \\"It's horror punk, and you get exactly what you expect.

The park was established in 1926 with the county's purchase of of formerly private land, and was expanded in 1936 and 1937 through the annexation of county tax foreclosures. The park's facilities and landscapes were improved substantially by the Works Progress Administration (WPA) throughout the 1930s.

However, the park's facilities were neglected and fell into disrepair between the 1970s and early 1990s, and the park soon earned a negative reputation.

It was traditionally used to protect flocks during the annual transhumance to high summer pasture in the Pyrenees. It is a distinct and separate breed both from the Pyrenean Mountain Dog and from the Pyrenean Shepherd.  History  The Pyrenean Mastiff originated in the historic Kingdom of Aragon, where it has been documented since the Middle Ages. Its origins and purpose were in the annual transhumance of flocks to the high pastures of the Pyrenees for the summer months, and the return to lower ground for the winter. The dogs were kept with the sheep from an early age; their job was to protect the flocks from predators, and in particular from wolves. Like other European flock guardian breeds, they were often fitted with a spiked metal wolf collar or for extra protection. Three of the dogs were shown in Madrid in 1890. In the first edition of the Libro de Or√≠genes Espa√±ol (Madrid, 1913), the second entry for dogs registered in 1912 is a \\"Mast√≠n Espa√±ol del Pirineo\\". In the latter 1940s the wolf disappeared from the Pyrenees, and once its principal function was no longer needed, the breed began to decline. It was fully accepted by the F√©d√©ration Cynologique Internationale in 1954. In 1977 a breed society, the , was formed; the dogs gradually became diffused through much of Spain, and later spread to other countries in Europe and the Americas, and to Australia and Japan.  Characteristics  The Pyrenean Mastiff is a very large dog. The minimum acceptable height at the withers for males is , and for females ; there is no upper limit, and larger dogs are preferred. They have a heavy white coat with a mask of a darker colour, and often with patches of the same colour on the body; the ears always have darker spots. The weight varies between about and .

It was originally built as a Gothic Revival Episcopal church from locally mined Rosendale cement, a material which covers the stonework exterior walls. After floods from nearby Rondout Creek damaged the building in the mid-1950s, the church abandoned it. It also survived a fire in the mid-1970s. A newly formed local library district was created to restore it for use as a library. In 1986 it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. Building The chapel is a one- story two-by-five-bay building with a rectangular chancel. Its walls are uncoursed cement rock rubble laid in Rosendale cement, with some embellishments and flourishes at windows and doors. A fire in the mid-1970s required the replacement of much of the original interior decoration, although the original wood ceiling is intact. All but two of the stained-glass windows had to be replaced as well. The building was designed to hold 150 people. On the exterior, the most prominent feature is the steeply pitched gable decorated with a scroll-sawn triangular insert with a central quatrefoil and three surrounding trefoils. The slate roof tiled in a decorative pattern of scallops and flowers. A small entrance vestibule and vestry are located on opposite ends of the east wall. On the west is a hexagonal spire paneled in a simple Gothic motif down at the base and louvered at the top, and a four-by- two-bay, architecturally sympathetic wing added in the 1970s, not considered contributing due to its lack of age. History The opening of the Delaware and Hudson Canal in the late 1820s triggered rapid growth in Rosendale, as in other communities along its route. In 1874, St. Peter's Episcopal Church in nearby Stone Ridge established St. John's Mission to serve worshippers there, and within two years it had grown enough to warrant its own chapel. Two thousand dollars was raised, and the building was built in 1877. The name of the mission was changed to All Saints'. In 1893 the mission became a parish in its own right, sponsoring missions of its own in the smaller nearby communities of Bloomingdale and Rifton for periods of the early 20th century. In 1956, flooding in the wake of Hurricane Flossy did enough damage to the church that it had to be abandoned, and the parish was dissolved. Andrew Snyder, a local descendant of the family that had first made a fortune from the cement, bought the building in 1957. He told the local women's club he would donate it for use as a library if they organized it. The club's members formed the Rosendale Library Association, and after restorations and improvements the chapel reopened as the library in 1959. A 1975 fire damaged the building somewhat, and the original interior finishings and all but two of the stained-glass windows had to be removed and replaced. As part of the repair work, a west wing that had been planned when the building was originally acquired was added. In the 1980s, after the property was listed on the Register, the New York State Legislature passed legislation, signed by then-governor Mario Cuomo, permitting the creation of a special library district. Voters in Rosendale approved its creation in 1987 and it received its charter from the state Board of Regents two years later. Work continues on the library building itself. In the 2000s the district obtained a $75,000 state grant to repair the slate roof, and it is currently raising the money required to match it. Aesthetics The church's basic design, with its thick walls and lancet windows, is consistent with the English country churches that first used the Gothic Revival style. The arches and brick surrounds of the windows are also consistent with the vernacular styles of churches built by congregants of English descent in the Hudson Valley. Embedded shells in the exterior, and other touches, suggest the Venetian Gothic stylings written about and championed by John Ruskin. The most unusual aspect of the building's architecture is the exterior finish. The rubblestone, normally left bare in such structures, was instead covered over with Rosendale cement, suggesting a desire to showcase a locally produced building material that had made many residents and congregants prosperous.

Games are blacked out based on two criteria: * A local broadcaster has priority to televise games of the team in their market over national broadcasters. For example, at one time TBS showed many Atlanta Braves games nationally and internationally in Canada. Fox Sports Net (FSN) also shows many games in other areas. If the Braves played a team that FSN or another local broadcaster showed, the local station will have the broadcast rights for its own local market, while TBS would have been blacked out in the same market for the duration of the game. A market that has a local team playing in a weekday ESPN or ESPN2 game and is shown on a local station will see ESPNEWS, or, in the past, another game scheduled on ESPN or ESPN2 at the same time (if ESPN or ESPN2 operates a regional coverage broadcasting and operates a game choice), or will be subject to an alternative programming feed. ESPN are allowed up to three \\"co-exists\\" per season for each team on Monday nights. ESPN2 does not allow co-exists of Monday night games; they will be blacked out in the home team market. MLB's streaming Internet video service is also subject to the same blackout rules, although in the near-future, MLB is rumored to be looking into the possibility of teams and their local broadcasters cutting deals with cable/satellite providers to permit in-market streaming. * Fox has certain rights for afternoon MLB games on Saturdays, and ESPN has the same rights for night games on Sundays. Broadcasters cannot show games of in-market teams, regardless of whether the game is home or away, if the game of the local team has a certain start time (usually there are no other games scheduled at these times). This, at least theoretically, is to make people watch the out-of-market game on ESPN or Fox. The reasoning is that since people will not be able to watch their favorite team, they may be willing to settle for some baseball, even if it involves teams they are not as excited about. This results in higher ratings for the national broadcaster by pulling baseball fans away from watching their own team. The Braves and the Texas Rangers (and the Miami Marlins before they moved into their retractable roof stadium, Marlins Park) have traditionally been allowed to play (and televise locally) Sunday night home games during the summer to avoid the extreme heat often found in their home markets. Otherwise, teams avoid scheduling home games within the broadcast windows of the exclusive network broadcasts (i.e. teams will play at 1:00 Eastern or 7:00 local time on Saturdays). Teams are also able to play (and televise locally) makeup games in the same window. United States U.S.A. MLB Blackout map All of the Contiguous United States, except for some small, remote, isolated patches, are within at least one team's blackout territory. Some areas may lie within the territories of two or more. As the accompanying map shows, teams generally have exclusive territorial rights only over their home cities' immediate area, but even then there are exceptions. For example, all of Texas, including the Houston metropolitan area as well as the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex, as well as the entire state of Louisiana, is within both the Astros' and Rangers' blackout areas. Outside of the immediate area, several teams may exercise blackout rights within the same territory. The entire state of Iowa, for example, is within the blackout areas of the Cubs, White Sox, Brewers, Twins, Cardinals, and Royals. Southern Nevada likewise lies within six MLB teams' blackout territories (Athletics, Giants, Angels, Dodgers, Padres, Diamondbacks). Areas of far western Kansas and the Nebraska panhandle represent an anomaly; although being geographically closer to Denver than Kansas City, they are included in the blackout territory for the Royals and not the Rockies. This is likely a remnant of pre-1993 territorial exclusions, since the Royals were the only team between Kansas City and California, except for the Astros and Rangers, between 1969 and 1992. A similar anomaly is that the El Paso area in Texas is not within the blackout territory of the Arizona Diamondbacks, despite El Paso being considerably closer to Phoenix than to either Texas-based MLB team (the New Mexico side of the El Paso area, by contrast, is within the D-Backs' blackout zone). This is also likely a remnant of territorial exclusions predating the D-Backs' 1998 entry into MLB. MLB relies on ZIP code prefixes (the first three digits of a ZIP code) to determine its blackout areas. For some areas in the West Valley of greater Phoenix, the ZIP code prefix is 853. Because of this, a fan that resides within 10 miles of Chase Field will be blacked out of all online San Diego Padres games. It's likely this is a remnant of the Padres' former blackout territory; prior to the Diamondbacks' arrival, all of Arizona was included in the Padres' blackout territory. Local broadcasts are not necessarily available in the whole blackout territory. For example, Fox Sports Wisconsin is unavailable in Iowa, so Milwaukee Brewers games are unavailable in the state. Due to the fact that they play in Canada, the Toronto Blue Jays do not have any part of their blackout territory in the United States. Changes due to 2012 MLB/ESPN deal A new contract between ESPN and Major League Baseball in 2012 virtually eliminated local blackouts involving the network's Monday and Wednesday night games, allowing ESPN coverage to co-exist with that of the local broadcasters in home markets. The agreement took effect at the start of the season. Canada rightthumb335pxCanadian regions subject to Note: Toronto Blue Jays territory covers all of Canada The Toronto Blue Jays' blackout territory includes all of Canada. However, they must share British Columbia and Alberta with the Seattle Mariners, Saskatchewan and Manitoba with the Minnesota Twins, and the Maritimes with the Boston Red Sox. In the past, the province of Quebec was not included in Toronto's territory, as it belonged to the Montreal Expos exclusively. Toronto and Montreal shared all territory outside of Ontario and Quebec. Toronto Blue Jays games are aired on Sportsnet in Canada. Also, Blue Jays games broadcast nationally over-the-air on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation television network have occasionally been subject to local blackout on CBET-TV, near Detroit. Consumer devices Consumer devices that enable television subscribers to transmit their home television feed outside their host area to a remote location over the Internet, a practice called placeshifting, have drawn the ire of MLB. MLB's position is that subscribers who wish to watch MLB telecasts while traveling either settle for the local telecasts available or subscribe to MLB's own broadcasts for an additional fee. Consumer advocates insist the practice is legal, since the remoted content is already purchased and is merely placeshifted by the subscriber; they claim MLB is asking fans to pay twice for the same content. MLB counters that travelers utilizing placeshifting technology are undercutting the blackout rights MLB grants to local and national broadcasters, as well as MLB's own internet service. In 2009, MLB launched MLB Network on basic cable similar to the NFL Network. As part of the new network, MLB has told owners to reduce their blackouts due to outrage amongst fans and letters pouring into MLB's offices. In particular, MLB is looking to address the availability of regional sports networks outside teams' immediate home markets. Ostensibly, if teams/channels are not available in certain locations, teams could lose their claims to such areas and coverage would be replaced by the MLB-controlled Extra Innings service.  Radio blackouts  In MLB, there are no radio blackouts, although ESPN Radio has exclusive rights to the World Series and only the flagship stations of the two participating ballclubs can originate coverage, though their broadcasts are also available on XM Satellite Radio as well as the subscription Gameday Audio package on MLB.com. All other network affiliates of the two clubs must carry the ESPN Radio feed, and they may not even be able to do so if they compete with an ESPN Radio affiliate in the same market. Additionally, the two flagships must broadcast ESPN Radio national commercials during their game coverage (though they can run live commercial reads for local sponsors during broadcasts and sell ads during typically extended pre/post-game shows). Additionally, radio stations (including flagships) are not allowed to broadcast any MLB games in the live Internet streams of their station programming or on out-of-market radio affiliates that carry the station's main signal. (MLB makes its own streams of the team networks available for a fee.) Some stations will replace the game with a recorded message explaining why the game cannot be heard on their stream. Others will simply stream the station's regularly scheduled programming that is being preempted by the game.

Murder of Charles Zumbach On 1 May 1958, Charles Zumbach, a seventy-year-old dealer in agricultural machinery, was brutally murdered at his home in Plan-les-Ouates. When his wife came home, she heard four shots and cries for help. Shortly afterwards an unknown man shoved her towards the garden and started shooting at her. Later, she could not recall the appearance of the offender. The perpetrator ‚Äì perhaps there were several ‚Äì then returned to the injured Charles Zumbach, and stabbed him to death with a knife before escaping on a bicycle.\\"LAffaire Poupette\\", Time magazine, February 15, 1960, retrieved 15 April 2010. Zumbach ran an agricultural machinery business in Plan-les-Ouates, which, it was later revealed, also served as the headquarters of an international gang of criminals and arms dealers led by a former member of the French Foreign Legion who called himself ‚ÄúReymond‚Äù.\\"Ein gewisses L√§cheln\\", Der Spiegel, 45/1960, 2 November 1960, p. 71 (German), retrieved 15 April 2010.  The accused, Pierre Jaccoud  When the police interrogated Zumbach's son Andr√©, he said he had received two calls at his workplace (a radio station in Geneva) the night of the killing, but both times the caller hung up without speaking. Andr√© Zumbach suspected that the caller wanted to make sure that he was not at his parents' house. Asked by the police whom he suspected of being the caller, Zumbach named Pierre Jaccoud, a prominent Geneva lawyer and politician who had had an eight-year relationship with Linda Baud (whom Jaccoud called \\"Poupette\\" ‚Äì \\"dolly\\"). Baud worked as executive secretary at the radio station, had had an affair with Andr√© Zumbach, and wanted to leave Jaccoud. Jaccoud had written her many desperate letters to convince her to stay with him. Eight months before the murder, Jaccoud sent nude photos of her to her new lover, Andr√© Zumbach. The police suspected Jaccoud of the murder.They suspected his initial motive for entering the house had been to retrieve the pictures. Karl Erb, et al. Die 50er Jahre. Ein dramatisches Jahrzehnt in Bildern. Z√ºrich: Ringier, [1981]. (German) p. 53. Contested expert testimony The police searched Jaccoud's apartment in his absence; he was in Stockholm on a business trip in connection with his position as Vice President of the Geneva Chamber of Commerce. They found blood on a coat and a Moroccan knife, but, as later studies revealed, Jaccoud and the victim shared the same blood group, Type O. Erik Undritz, a renowned Basel haematologist, and Pierre Hegg, head of the Geneva Forensic Laboratory, testified that there were also liver cells on the knife. However, this testimony was later contested; the cells could have been of animal origin, and the knife had been stored for some time after the murder. Jaccoud owned two pistols, but neither was the murder weapon. In addition, on the road near Zumbach's house a button was found that matched the buttons of one of Jaccoud's coats. The coat itself was found in a box of used clothing, and was missing exactly one button. On his return in June 1958, Jaccoud was arrested. In prison he suffered a nervous breakdown and spent most of his time in the infirmary. The trial From 18 January 1960 onwards, the trial took place before a jury in Geneva. The case attracted attention far beyond the Swiss borders. For the prosecution, Attorney General Charles Cornu reminded a reporter for Die Zeit of a \\"god of revenge\\" and \\"a classical mask of tragedy\\".Ursula von Kardorff, \\"Mordsache Jaccoud - der 'Proze√ü des Jahres'\\", Die Zeit 12 February 1960, posted 24 July 20088, retrieved 16 April 2010. Defending Jaccoud was the famous Paris barrister Ren√© Floriot. Jaccoud was in a hospital chair. There were many mix- ups; for example, Zumbach's wife did not pick Jaccoud out of a line-up but instead identified a policeman. Linda Baud stated that at the time of the act, she was no longer in a relationship with Andr√© Zumbach, but instead with another man. Nevertheless, Jaccoud was found guilty of 'simple manslaughter' and sentenced to seven years in prison minus time served. The jury deliberated for three hours.\\"The Verdict\\", Time magazine, February 15, 1960. Controversy over the verdict The verdict in the Jaccoud case is one of the most controversial in Swiss jurisprudence.Sylvie Arsever, \\"Affaire Jaccoud: l'ombre d'un doute?\\", Le Temps, 9 July 2007, retrieved 16 April 2010 (registration required): Un des dossiers ¬´les plus troublants, les plus √©nigmatiques qui aient jamais d√©fray√© la chronique judiciaire de notre pays¬ª. Le Journal de Gen√®ve n'exag√®re pas. At the time, for the Paris press, the case typified Swiss compromise. They regarded Jaccoud as a victim of Genevan Calvinist morality. Floriot said in Paris, \\"If my client was guilty, he should have received a much heavier sentence; if not, he should have been liberated\\". He called the case \\"a second Dreyfus Affair\\" and blamed the verdict on excessive respect for authority, in this case the prosecution.Gerhard Mauz,\\"Ein Mord, ein Knopf, und Calvins Geist\\", Der Spiegel 14/1965, 31 March 1965, p. 119. (German) At the time of the trial, Swiss students infuriated by the insult publicly burned Paris newspapers. According to Hans Martin Sutermeister, a Bern doctor bent on exposing courtroom injustices, the verdict was nothing more than a miscarriage of justice, whose main cause was inadequate forensic expertise.Hans Martin Sutermeister, Summa Iniuria: Ein Pitaval der Justizirrt√ºmer. F√ºnfhundert F√§lle menschlichen Versagens im Bereich der Rechtsprechung in kriminal- und sozialpsychologischer Sicht., Basel: Elfenau Verlag, 1976, OCLC 251884191, p. 124. Sutermeister described Hegg as \\"an autodidact without a basic education, who had already been wrong more often\\".\\"Ein gewisses L√§cheln\\", Der Spiegel, 45/1960, 2 November 1960: eines Autodidakten ohne gr√ºndliche Ausbildung, der sich schon h√§ufiger irrte. Sutermeister, convinced of Jaccoud's innocence, believed that he had known that Baud was no longer dating Andr√© Zumbach and that Zumbach had been murdered because he supplied Algerian rebels with $12,000 worth of dud explosives. He pointed out that \\"Reymond\\" and his arms dealer friends, unbeknownst to Zumbach, also kept knives and bayonets in the garage, one of which could have been the murder weapon. Sutermeister spent considerable time attempting to show that Jaccoud's conviction was a result of forensic \\"dilettantism\\". Hegg had been censured for confusing human and pig's blood in a previous investigation, and had been defended on that occasion by Jaccoud ‚Äì who had difficulty getting him to pay his fee. At one point Hegg sued Sutermeister for defamation. But he was not alone in disputing the verdict. Horace Mastronardi called it \\"the greatest judicial error of the post-war years\\".Roger d'Ivernois, \\"Apr√®s la d√©mission de deux juges √† la Cour de cassation: Les d√©fenseurs de Pierre Jaccoud cherchent un Zola moderne\\" Journal de Gen√®ve 1 June 1976, p. 12 (French), retrieved 16 April 2010: la plus grande erreur judiciaire de l'apr√®s-guerre. He and other lawyers tried to have it reversed for \\"more than twenty years\\". Nonetheless, in 1980, the court rejected a final appeal of the case. Pierre Jaccoud died in 1994.

These organizations, often belonging to groups such as CLIPSAS, are not recognized by the Grand Lodges that form Anglo-American Freemasonry,Freemasonry and the Anti-Christian Movement, E Cahill, SJEnglish and American Brotherhood, The Builder Magazine nor by their Prince Hall Masonry counterparts. History‚Äîdiffering Masonic traditions Most American Freemasons belong to Grand Lodges that follow the Anglo-American Masonic tradition, which insists on new candidates having a belief in Deity, meaning that atheists in particular are not allowed to join. In 1877 the Grand Orient de France (GOdF) dropped this requirement and the United Grand Lodge of England (UGLE) withdrew its recognition. Many masons believe that this caused the American Grand lodges to follow UGLE and withdraw recognition. However, the historical facts are more complicated. Several American Grand Lodges had withdrawn their recognition of GOdF as early as the 1860s, as the result of a jurisdictional dispute that had nothing to do with the change in the GOdF's stance on religion or the bible in lodge. Furthermore, during the First World War a half-century later, several American Grand Lodges briefly reinstated their recognition of the GOdF; this was \\"long after the GOF had changed its policy on religion, and the American grand lodges made detailed studies and were fully aware of the policies of the French bodies they were recognizing.\\"U.S. Recognition of French Grand Lodges in the 1900s , Paul Bessel, published in Heredom: The Transactions of the Scottish Rite Research Society -- volume 5, 1996, pages 221-244ADDRESS TO THE 2002 CALIFORNIA MASONIC SYMPOSIUM , by Alain Bauer, Grand Master of the Grand Orient of France, July 27th, 2002 The use of God as a tool for Masonic politics has a long history.The Politics of Grand Lodge Foreign Relations Currently, none of the mainstream US Grand Lodges recognize GOdF. Background on the belief in Deity There is some debate as to exactly when Freemasonry in the Anglo-American tradition started requiring its members to have a belief in Deity. There are hints that this was the case from the earliest days of Freemasonry: The Regius Manuscript, the oldest known Masonic document dating from around 1390, states that a Mason \\"must love well God and holy church always.\\" James Anderson's 1723 Constitutions state that \\"A Mason is oblig'd by his Tenure, to obey the moral Law, and if he rightly understands the Art, he will never be a stupid Atheist, nor an irreligious Libertine.\\" Anglo-American Masons interpret this passage to mean that Atheists are barred from joining the fraternity, while Continental Freemasons disagree. However one interprets Anderson's Constitution, it is important to remember that they only applied to the Grand Lodge of England. GOdF did not include this requirement in its original constitutions. While GOdF did add language that required belief in Deity in 1849, in 1877 GOdF changed it back to the original usage, without this requirement.Iowa Proceedings 1918, pp. 25-29.Denslow, Ray V. Freemasonry in the Eastern Hemisphere, p. 170. Whatever the historical rights and wrongs of the matter may be, the reasons why the disharmony between these two Masonic factions continues in the present day is primarily centered on whether a belief in Deity is required (although there is also disagreement as to whether women's Masonic groups can be recognized). Today, the Grand Orient de France believes in La√Øcit√©, which \\"imposes that all men are given, without distinction of class, origine or denomination, the means to be themselves, to have the freedom of choice, to be responsible for their own maturity and masters of their destiny.\\"Grand Orient of France: La√Øcit√© Can Freemasonry be Secular? The other French bodies Complicating the issue of recognition is the fact that, in addition to the Grand Orient, there are at least twelve Franc-Ma√ßonnerie Fran√ßaise, Les Ob√©diences Traditionnelles Franc-Ma√ßonnerie Fran√ßaise, Les Ob√©diences Progressistes other Grand bodies in France, the two largest being: the Grand Lodge of France (GLF), and the Grand Lodge National of France (GLNF). The Grand Lodge National of France follows the Anglo-American tradition and is recognized by the mainstream American Lodges. The Grand Lodge of France falls between the Anglo-American and Continental traditions, not allowing atheists to join its own ranks, but maintaining relations with bodies that do allow atheists. For this and other reasons, it is also not currently recognized by any of the mainstream American Grand Lodges but were during the twentieth century recognised, or visitations were approved, by up to twenty-three of the US mainstream Grand Lodges. The willingness of the Grand Lodge of France to recognize both sides in the larger Masonic Schism means that it is often the first to recognize small splinter groups that form out of both traditions. GLF can be seen as being the leader of a third faction in the larger Masonic schism, but is often grouped within the Continental Tradition by those in the Anglo-American tradition. As of 2010, there are no Masonic bodies that fall into this third grouping in North America, but there have been some in the past. Organisations The Women's Grand Lodge of Belgium, the Grand Orient de FranceLodges in New York City , San Francisco , Los Angeles , Washington DC and Montr√©al in Qu√©bec and the Women's Grand Lodge of FranceFeminine Grand Lodge of France have lodges in North America. Grande Loge Nationale du Canada (which is a member of CLIPSAS) has 15 lodges, mostly in Qu√©bec and Montr√©al. In Mexico there is the Spanish- speaking Grand Orient of Mexico (also a member of CLIPSAS). There are several English-speaking groups that belong to the Continental tradition. George Washington Union The George Washington Union began as a single lodge, named \\"George Washington No.1\\", on December 10, 1976 to work under the concept of absolute freedom of conscience. The newly established Lodge received its Charter from the Grand Orient de France in accord with a covenant signed in August 1977 and ratified by the General Assembly of the Grand Orient de France on September 1978. In 1979, this lodge joined the Centre de Liaison et d'Information des Puissances ma√ßonniques Signataires de l'Appel de Strasbourg (CLIPSAS). It was refounded in 1996.Page 2, France: Where Freemasons Are Still Feared, by Joshua Levine on April 19, 2012, Businessweek By 2001 several other Continental style lodges had been formed in North America. It was deemed appropriate in 2002 that the Grand Orient de France officially recognize and collaborate with the George Washington Union as a separate Grand Orient operating in North America with the ability to charter lodges.George Washington Union Le Droit Humain The International Order of Co- Freemasonry, Le Droit Humain, is a fraternal brotherhood that has many Federations and Jurisdictions worldwide.

Collections   Archives Florida  Archives Florida is a database of guides and inventories (finding aids) for Florida archive collections. Finding aids can be contributed by Florida libraries, museums, historical societies, and other groups. The database is constantly updated, and users can browse or search collectively or by individual archives. Contributing libraries and museums include Broward County Library, Florida Atlantic University Libraries, Florida International University Libraries, Florida State University, Rollins College, and Winter Park Public Library.  Aerial Photography Florida  With approximately 160,000 photos, the Aerial Photography: Florida Collection is the largest and most complete collection of Florida aerial photographs outside of the National Archives. The photographs center on the changes in Florida's land use spanning the years of 1937 to 1990. This online collection was funded by three Library Services and Technology Act grants. Users can search using map search, flights by county, and ArcGIS search. Additionally, images can be downloaded as JPEG 2000 files. Aerial photography has been used as an educational resource, enabling farmers to better utilize their land and informing city planners in their decision-making process.  Big Cypress National Preserve Collection  Documenting the natural heritage of the Big Cypress National Preserve, the Big Cypress National Preserve Collection serves as a digital photo-album showing the flora and fauna of this preserve in southwestern Florida. The collection was produced by the Preserve's staff alongside the Southwest Florida Library Network (SWFLN) in a project funded by the State of Florida's Library Services and Technology Act (LSTA) grants program.  Coral Gables Memory  Donated to the city of Coral Gables by Kerdyk Realty, Coral Gables Memory is an album that contains photographs of homes and business structures. Coral Gables is a planned community that took much inspiration from the Garden City and City Beautiful movements of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Most of the photographs in Coral Gables Memory collection were captured in the 1940s. Users will find visual and textual materials that document the history, culture, architecture, and people of Coral Gables. Additionally, minute books, published works, postcards, among other materials, can be viewed in this collection.  Everglades Digital Library  Established in 1996, the Everglades Digital Library (EDL) features online texts, articles, reports, photographs, maps, data sets, educational materials, and historical records all pertaining to the South Florida environment. The primary goal of this collection is to support research, education, decision making, and information resource management within the greater Everglades community. The materials within this collection originate from such sources as libraries, government agencies, non-profit organizations, and educational institutions. The EDL is a service of the Digital Collections Center at Florida International University Libraries. In terms of technology, the EDL runs on the Collection Workflow Integration System (CWIS), which was specifically created to help build collections in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math for the National Science Digital Library. Because of this system, the EDL enjoys many features, including Amazon resource annotations and ratings, keyword searching, RSS feed support, an integrated metadata editing tool, prepackaged taxonomies, user-definable schema, and even user interface themes.  Florida Heritage Collection  Established in 1998 by the libraries of the State University System of Florida (SUS) in partnership with the Florida Center for Library Automation (FCLA) and the State Library of Florida, the Florida Heritage Collection is the first statewide digital library initiative in Florida. This collection is notable in that it provides online access to materials broadly representing Florida's history, culture, arts, literature, sciences and social sciences. Some of the major focuses of the Florida Heritage Collection are Native American and minority populations, exploration and development, tourism, the natural environment, and regional interests. Florida's ten state universities contribute materials from their archives, special collections, and libraries to this collection. Users viewing this collection will find a variety of local and regional materials about Florida's history and cultural, including local history books and booklets, advertising materials from the Florida Boom, Civil War letters, and other materials that provide knowledge of Florida's history. Due to the largely emigrant nature of Florida's history, the collection stresses the importance of featuring family papers and records, diaries, letters, business records, maps, photographs, and other materials that are unique and important for historical research. In terms of workflow, the contributing university libraries and archives contribute catalog records for the digitized version to a central database. For each submission, libraries indicate the grade level of the material in accordance with Florida's Sunshine State Standards.  Miami Metropolitan Archive  Developed in 2001, the Miami Metropolitan Archive is focused on preserving and sharing early Miami materials.

Miami Metropolitan Archive's goal is to provide digital access to important source materials on Miami-Dade County urban development. The Miami Metropolitan Archive is operated by the Urban, Regional & Local Government Documents Department at Florida International University Libraries and Miami City Clerk's Office. For the years of 1896 to 1966, users will find government documents, including Miami City Council meeting minutes, charters, departmental annual reports, and planning documents.  Florida Historical Quarterly  An online version of the academic journal by the same title, the goal of the Florida Historical Quarterly is to expand users' understanding of Florida's historical development. This collection emphasizes scholarly research and appreciation for the peoples, places, themes, and diversity of Florida's past. Although the Florida Historical Quarterly was originally a part of the Florida Heritage Collection, in 2005 the Digital Projects Planning Committee decided to separate it into its own individual collection because of its high volume of use and the need for direct access.  Koreshan State Historic Site Collection  The Koreshan State Historic Site Collection focuses on the Koreshan State Historic Site, one of Florida's state parks and a cultural heritage site. This collection serves as a digital photo-album of the site. The photographs within this collection were contributed by the Estero Historical Society and the Florida Division of Recreation and Parks - Koreshan State Historic Site. The collection is funded by the Library Services and Technology Act Grants (LSTA).

He studied as a child with his father and with Karl Drechsler in Dessau. He had three brothers, Carl Hermann Schroeder (1843-1909), who became a composer and violin professor in Berlin, Franz Schr√∂der (before 1855-?) would work as a conductor in St. Petersburg, Russia, and the youngest brother, Alwin Schroeder (1855-1928) was a German-American cellist best known as leading cellist in the Boston Symphony. In his early youth Karl studied with Friedrich Kiel and was appointed to the Sondershausen Hofkapelle at the age of 14. He toured Europe with his family's acclaimed string quartet traveling throughout Germany, Italy, France, Belgium, and even as far as St. Petersburg. In 1872 he was appointed Kapellmeister of the Kroll Oper in Berlin; late that year, the string quartet was disbanded on his appointment to the Brunswick Hofkapelle commencing in 1873. A year later he became solo cellist of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra and professor at the conservatory. He returned to Sondershausen in 1881, replacing Max Erdmannsd√∂rfer as Hofkapellmeister and founding a music school; this he sold to A. Schultze in 1886 when he was appointed conductor of the Duitse Opera in Rotterdam. He held similar posts in Berlin (1887) and in Hamburg (1888), where he succeeded Joseph Sucher at the Neues Stadt Theater. His former music school having become a state conservatory, he returned to Sondershausen in 1890 as its director, remaining until 1909. In 1911 he took up his last post, as professor at the Stern Conservatory in Berlin, where he remained for more than a decade before retiring to Bremen. Schr√∂der's compositions include symphonic works, chamber music pieces, string quartets, songs for solo instruments, two operas and an operetta. In addition to his compositions and educational works he produced careful editions of Classical cello pieces.

Originally thought of as two separate types, A and B, it is now considered an evolving wave form, initially of biphasic T wave inversions and later becoming symmetrical, often deep (>2 mm), T wave inversions in the anterior precordial leads. First described by Hein J. J. Wellens and colleagues in 1982 in a subgroup of people with unstable angina, it does not seem to be rare, appearing in 18% of patients in his original study. A subsequent prospective study identified this syndrome in 14% of patients at presentation and 60% of patients within the first 24 hours. The presence of Wellens' syndrome carries significant diagnostic and prognostic value. All people in the De Zwann's study with characteristic findings had more than 50% stenosis of the left anterior descending artery (mean = 85% stenosis) with complete or near-complete occlusion in 59%. In the original Wellens' study group, 75% of those with the typical syndrome manifestations had an anterior myocardial infarction. Sensitivity and specificity for significant (more or equal to 70%) stenosis of the LAD artery was found to be 69% and 89%, respectively, with a positive predictive value of 86%. Wellens' sign has also been seen as a rare presentation of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy or stress cardiomyopathy.

Its location is northwest of Creighton by Hanson Lake Road and Highway 135. Its name in Cree is Opawikoscikcan which means \\"The Narrows of Fear\\". The community is northwest of the narrows that join Mirond and Pelican Lakes, which lie between the Sturgeon-Weir and Churchill River systems. Pelican Narrows is the administrative headquarters for the Peter Ballantyne Cree Nation, a member of the Prince Albert Grand Council, and the majority of the townsite is reserve land. The community consists of the Northern Village of Pelican Narrows and Pelican Narrows 184B Indian Reserve. Together they formed a population centre of 2,703 people in 2011.  History  The Cree settlement dates from at least 1730. It was an area of trade for the Hudson's Bay and North West companies. In 1874, the Hudson's Bay Company established a permanent post at Pelican Narrows. This became a Northern Store in 1987 which remains open to this day.

The OPEC Fund was conceived at the Conference of the Sovereigns and Heads of State of OPEC Member Countries, which was held in Algiers, Algeria, in March 1975. A Solemn Declaration of the Conference \\"reaffirmed the natural solidarity which unites OPEC countries with other developing countries in their struggle to overcome underdevelopment\\", and called for measures to strengthen cooperation between these countries. The OPEC Fund's objective is to reinforce financial cooperation between OPEC Member Countries and other developing countries, by providing financial support to the latter for their socioeconomic development. The institution's central mission is to foster South-South Partnership with fellow developing countries worldwide with the aim of eradicating poverty. OPEC Fund's headquarters are located in Vienna, Austria. The current Director-General is Dr Abdulhamid Alkhalifa of Saudi Arabia. He assumed office as Director-General and Chief Executive Officer of the OPEC Fund on November 1, 2018. OPEC Fund headquarters OPEC Fund Headquarters, Vienna, Austria The OPEC Fund Headquarters (located in Vienna's first district, on the Ringstra√üe) was the residential palace of the Austrian Archduke Wilhelm Franz Karl. Built between 1864 and 1868 to the architectural design of Theophil von Hansen, the palace was sold to the German Order of Knights (Teutonic Order) in 1870 and used as headquarters of the Grand Master, the last of whom was Archduke Eugen. From 1894, it served as the palace of both the Grand and German Masters, acquiring the name, Deutschmeister-Palais. In 1938 following the dissolution of the German Order of Knights, the building was seized by National Socialist (Nazi) Germany and, in 1942, it was handed over to the police authorities. Between 1945 and 1975, it served as headquarters of the Vienna police. After an interregnum, the building became the property of the OPEC Fund. History Following the First OPEC Summit in Algiers, Algeria, in 1975, Member Countries expressed their commitment to assist the developing countries through a collective financial facility. As a result, in 1976, the Finance Ministers of Member Countries met and established the OPEC Special Fund, through which Member Countries would channel aid to developing countries. The OPEC Special Fund started its operations in 1976, with initial resources of about $800 million. By the end of 1977 it had extended 71 loans to 58 developing countries, and had channeled donations from its Member Countries to other development institutions, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Trust Fund and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD). As a result of its successful performance, member countries decided in 1980 to convert the temporary facility into a permanent legal entity called the OPEC Fund for International Development; it became a permanent international development agency in May 1980. Member countries The OPEC Fund has 12 member countries: Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Venezuela. Ecuador reactivated its membership in June 2014 after a 22-year absence. Qatar terminated its membership on 1 January 2019. Means The OPEC Fund provides financial assistance in a number of ways, with the distribution between the different types of aid changing over time as conditions in recipient countries evolve and needs alter. The methods of funding have included: * Extending concessionary financial assistance in the form of loans for development projects and programs, balance of payments support and trade financing * Financing private-sector activities in developing countries * Providing grants in support of technical assistance, food aid, research and similar activities, and humanitarian emergency relief * Contributing to the resources of other development institutions whose work benefits developing countries * Serving as an agent of OPEC Member Countries in the international financial arena whenever collective action is deemed appropriate Resources The OPEC Fund's resources consist of voluntary contributions made by its member countries and the accumulated reserves derived from the institution's various operations. A replenishment of US$1 billion was approved in June 2011 by the institution's supreme authority, the Ministerial Council, as a direct response to the increasing needs of developing countries and the negative impact of the financial crisis on their economies. Beneficiaries All developing countries are, in principle, eligible for The OPEC Fund assistance, although the least developed countries are given higher priority and have received more than one-half of the institution's cumulative commitments to date. Also eligible are international institutions whose activities benefit the developing countries. OPEC Fund Member Countries are excluded from benefiting from assistance, except in the case of disaster relief or within the context of a regional program. Over the years, the OPEC Fund has spread its presence to 135 countries https://opecfund.org/who-we-are/at-a-glance. Operations The OPEC Fund's operations are organized into 10 focus areas: *Agriculture:Funding has helped boost crop and livestock production, as well as improve rural infrastructure, such as irrigation systems and storage facilities for animal fodder. Support has also been extended to help promote agricultural research. *Education:The OPEC Fund's financing has helped construct and rehabilitate schools, purchase equipment and teaching materials, as well as provide teacher training. The OPEC Fund has also sponsored the attendance of participants from developing countries to various conferences and workshops. *Energy:A lead partner in the UN's Sustainable Energy for All initiative, the OPEC Fund has supported energy projects ranging from infrastructure and equipment provision to research and capacity building. *Financial:Support to this sector has primarily been the channeling of funds to Micro-, small- and medium-size enterprises (MSMEs) via financial intermediaries such as national and regional development banks, commercial banks and leasing companies. *Health:Support has included construction and modernization of hospitals, health clinics and other infrastructure. Capacity building and support to primary healthcare programs has also been extended. The OPEC Fund is also an active partner in the global fight against HIV/AIDS through a special grant program. *Industry:The OPEC Fund's funding has benefited all sub-sectors, including building materials, steel, fertilizers and chemicals. *Multisectoral:This includes undertakings that cut across more than one sector and often supports the activities of Social Investment Funds, whose projects are usually demand-driven at a local level and have a strong element of community participation. *Telecommunications:The majority of funding to this sector was extended under OPEC Fund's private sector facility, with financing going to mobile network operators in Africa and Asia. *Transportation:The OPEC Fund's support has been consistently high to this sector and ranges from construction and rehabilitation of roads, seaports and airports, to railways, inland waterways and urban mass transit. *Water and Sanitation:The OPEC Fund has helped finance a wide range of operations to help provide clean drinking water and safe sanitation systems. These range from large-scale water storage, treatment and distribution projects to village pumps and school latrines, as well as to schemes to optimize water use in arid regions. Energy for the Poor Initiative (EPI) The OPEC Fund's Energy for the Poor initiative (EPI) emerged from the Solemn Declaration of the Third OPEC Summit, which took place in Riyadh in November 2007. The Declaration called for the complete eradication of energy poverty as a global priority and urged the OPEC Fund to intensify its efforts in support of this goal. The EPI was launched by King Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz of Saudi Arabia in June 2008 and subsequently adopted by the OPEC Fund as its flagship program. Since 2008, the OPEC Fund has worked tirelessly to push energy poverty to the top of the international agenda and was responsible for the universal acceptance of energy poverty eradication as the ‚Äúmissing‚Äù Millennium Development Goal. In June 2012, the OPEC Fund Member Countries issued a Ministerial Declaration on Energy Poverty and dedicated a revolving minimum sum of US$1 billion to finance the EPI. The OPEC Fund is boosting the volume of its operations in the energy sector accordingly, in collaboration with all relevant stakeholders. The OPEC Fund and the United Nations‚Äô Sustainable Energy for All initiative (SE4ALL) the OPEC Fund has Permanent Observer status at the United Nations. As a result of its high- profile advocacy efforts, the OPEC Fund is a key partner in Sustainable Energy for All (SE4ALL), which has three goals: to achieve universal access to sustainable energy, to double energy efficiency, and to double the share of renewables, all by the year 2030. The OPEC Fund considers its own EPI as complementary to the objectives of SE4ALL. In 2011, the OPEC Fund's Director- General Suleiman Jasir Al-Herbish was invited to join the UN Secretary- General's High-level Group on SE4ALL, which was charged with developing the Action Agenda that was presented to the 2012 Rio+20 Summit. Public sector operations Public sector lending forms the central pillar of the OPEC Fund's operations, accounting for more than two-thirds of total, cumulative commitments. These operations are carried out in direct cooperation with the governments of partner countries in support of their national development strategies. The OPEC Fund's public sector loans are concessional, with low interest rates and long repayment periods. Lending terms are based on several factors, including the per capita gross national income (GNI) of each Partner Country. Also included under the public sector is the OPEC Fund's contribution to the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. Private sector operations The Private sector facility (PSF) was established in 1998 in response to growing demand among partner countries for investment in private enterprise, which is increasingly seen as the engine of economic and social growth. The Facility is a market-oriented financing window that responds to the demand for financing in developing countries in support of their private sector development strategies. The PSF seeks to promote economic development by encouraging the growth of productive private enterprise in developing countries and supporting the development of local capital markets. Successful interventions stimulate economic growth, generating jobs and income and thereby reduce poverty. Trade Finance Facility The OPEC Fund's Trade Finance Facility (TFF) was established in 2006 to broaden the means available to the OPEC Fund to alleviate poverty and promote economic development. It is a distinct, additional window for supporting eligible developing countries in their efforts to achieve growth and prosperity. The Facility seeks out transactions that are developmentally, environmentally and socially sound, applying credit principles in line with standard practices and setting reasonable market-based return targets. TFF financing has been used to support the import/export of a diverse range of goods/sectors, including oil, cotton, steel, strategic food products, garments and equipment. Grants Grants are awarded largely on the basis of the type of project and its expected outcomes; the number of beneficiaries; and the recipient country's socio- economic situation. The Grants Program includes the following sub-programs: *Technical Assistance: Extended to national and regional development projects that aim at fostering sustainable development and reducing poverty. These cover a wide range of development sectors, with women and children given high priority. *Research and similar activities: Supports activities that increase South-South and North-South cooperation, especially in the field of exchanging know-how and enhancing capacity-building, including human resource development. *Emergency relief aid: To help mitigate the suffering of victims of catastrophes‚Äïincluding those in the OPEC Fund Member States. Assistance is channeled through specialized relief agencies. *Special Health Program: Since 2002, the OPEC Fund has been an active partner in the global fight against HIV/AIDS, but this focus has now shifted to incorporate other preventable diseases, including TB, malaria and waterborne illnesses. Also targeted are non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as cancer, diabetes and heart disease, which are more prevalent in poor developing countries. *Grant Program for Palestine: This program supports sustainable development interventions in the West Bank and Gaza, as well as humanitarian relief in times of crisis. It also addresses needs in refugee camps in neighboring countries. *Energy poverty: The Energy portfolio supports the OPEC Fund's flagship ‚ÄòEnergy for the Poor Initiative‚Äô, and focuses on the delivery of innovative, medium and small-scale energy poverty solutions, primarily to off-grid, rural communities. Contributions to other organizations Common Fund for Commodities (CFC) The Common Fund for Commodities (CFC) is an autonomous intergovernmental financial institution established within the framework of the United Nations. Since 1981, the OPEC Fund has supported the CFC, having made available a total of US$83.6 million in support of the institution. The First Account of US$37.2 million enabled 38 least developed member countries to complete their subscriptions to the CFC First Account Capital. By the end of 2014, the OPEC Fund had signed agreements with 37 of these countries. Under the Framework of Financial Support and within the context of the Second Account totalling US$46.4 million, the amount of US$37.9 million has been committed in support of 57 commodity projects in 52 countries; 32 in Africa, 14 in Asia and six in Latin America. Projects eligible for financial support are commodity-focused covering the value chain from production to consumption and benefiting the poor. International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) The OPEC Fund has played a significant role in the establishment of IFAD, channeling US$861.1 million in contributions from OPEC member countries towards the agency's initial capital and first replenishment. Since IFAD's creation, OPEC member states have maintained their firm support of the agency, contributing to additional replenishments of its resources. In addition, the OPEC Fund itself has given a further US$20 million as a special contribution from its own resources. International Monetary Fund (IMF) Trust Fund Via the OPEC Fund, financial resources valued at US$110 million were transferred by a number of OPEC member states to the IMF-administered Trust Fund which was established in May 1976. Representing profits accruing to seven of these countries from the sale of gold held on their behalf by the IMF, these resources were allocated to provide concessional balance of payments assistance to eligible low-income IMF member countries.

She sank in the Sound of Mull on 18 December 1954 after striking a rock. Career Hispania was built by the Antwerp Engineering Co Ltd, Hoboken, Antwerp, Belgium. She was yard number 59. Hispania was launched in 1912 and completed in December of that year. She was owned by Svenska Lloyd AB. Hispania was managed by a number of different managers, including H Metcalft, followed by K R B√∂kman from c1930. During the Second World War, Hispania was seized by the French authorities. In 1940, she was on a voyage from Kaolack, Senegal via Casablanca, Morocco to Bordeaux, France with a cargo of peanuts. During the voyage, she was attacked and severely damaged. On 2 June 1940, Hispania was detained in Bordeaux. On 8 October 1940, she was seized by the Vichy Government. On 8 November 1940, an application was made to declare her as a war prize. The crew were allowed to return to Sweden in December 1940, except for her captain and a mechanic. On 15 April 1941, Hispania was declared a war prize and ownership passed to the Kriegsmarine. Svenska Lloyd AB objected to this decision. On 8 February 1942, Hispania and Sirius were ordered to sail to Rotterdam under the command of the Kriegsmarine. On 1 November 1942, the Kriegsmarine ceased command of the ship. The next day, a German Schnellboot (fast boat) attack left one dead and two seriously wounded. On 19 December 1942, Hispania was handed back to Svenska Lloyd AB on payment of RM44,017.69. She departed Rotterdam on 1 January 1943, bound for Gothenburg. Sinking On 18 December 1954, Hispania sank after hitting a reef in a storm. Heading to Varberg, Sweden, from Liverpool she attempted to navigate through the Sound of Mull but hit the Sgeir More (Big Rock) and started to list. The order to abandon ship was given and the crew lowered the lifeboats and rowed to shore. Captain Ivan Dahn refused to leave the ship and chose to go down with it.SS Hispania The other twenty crew were saved. At the time, Hispania was carrying a cargo of asbestos, rubber sheeting and steel. Wreck The wreck sits, intact and upright, in of clear water, at . The Hispania can be dived on only during slack water, which is between 1 and 2 hours before high or low water near the Scottish town of Oban. Located in the northern aspects of the Sound of Mull, the Hispania is facing the shore and close to a red channel buoy. The water temperature ranges from 14 ¬∞C in summer to as low as 5 ¬∞C in winter. In the summer time, a common hazard are the migrating stinging jellyfish that pass over the wreck. Their tentacles often get caught on the shot line and are dangerous to divers. Sound of Mull Remote Sensing Project (SOMAP) was an underwater survey on the behest of Historic Scotland to catalog all sites in the Sound of Mull. Through research and a through sonar survey, SOMAP was able to determine the status of the SS Hispania. Their findings determined that the ship was salvaged throughout the 1950s by Scarborough Sub-Aqua Club and since then the popularity of diving the wreck has resulted in the removal of all non-ferrous artifacts. No archaeological surveys of the site had been undertaken until SOMAP's involvement. The ship's horn was salvaged in the 1960s by a member of Scarborough Sub-Aqua Club and is now on display there. Minor damage was caused by a scallop dredger in 1999 when its fishing gear pulled down one of the masts and caused minor scrape damage. A scour pit caused by currents removing sand and mud from one side of the ship is causing the ship to slowly list into the depression. In November 2002 the wreck of Hispania was purchased by the Puffin Dive Centre, Oban. Propulsion Hispania was propelled by a triple expansion steam engine which was built by the North East Marine Engine Co Ltd, Newcastle upon Tyne. It had cylinders of , and diameter by stroke, developing , giving a speed of . Official number and code letters Official Numbers were a forerunner to IMO Numbers. Hispania had the Swedish Official Number 5396 and used the Code Letter JTCB between 1930 and 1944, and SEWG from 1934.
