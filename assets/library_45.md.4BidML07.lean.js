Sherwood Ross (May 5, 1933 ‚Äì June 21, 2018) was an American journalist, activist, songwriter and poet. He was best known for publicizing James Meredith's historic voter registration drive through rural Mississippi called the ‚ÄúMarch Against Fear.‚Äù He was credited with helping save Meredith's life after the civil rights leader was shot during an ambush.  \\"James, he's got a gun!\\"  The march set out from Memphis on June 5, 1966, with only a handful of participants ‚Äì five men, including Meredith and Ross. Meredith wanted to inspire black voters in his home state of Mississippi to exercise their voting rights. His march was to become a flash-point for the civil rights movement. The next day a lone white gunman opened fire on Meredith in Hernando, Mississippi. Ross can be seen in photos tending to Meredith's gunshot wounds. Ross had hoped to avert such a tragedy by encouraging news agencies to follow the event. Meredith was ambushed all the same, but the ensuing media coverage sparked outrage and galvanized the movement's leadership, which had spurned Meredith as a lone crusader. \\"James, he's got a gun!\\" Ross was quoted as saying in his eye-witness account of the shooting that was published on the front page of the Washington Star and other major newspapers. Photos of Meredith writhing in agony appeared in newspapers around the world. One such photo by the Associated Press garnered the Pulitzer Prize in 1967. These images ‚Äì along with Ross' appearance the following day on NBC's \\"Today Show\\" calling for reinforcements ‚Äì prompted Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Stokely Carmichael, and other civil rights leaders to rally to Mississippi to continue in Meredith's footsteps. \\"Thousands from all races responded over the next few weeks so that the renewed march became, literally, a turning point and victory celebration over Jim Crow in Mississippi,\\" Ross later wrote about the event. After his release from the hospital, Meredith rejoined marchers on June 25 ‚Äì the day before the conclusion of the 220-mile trek to Jackson, Mississippi. As they descended upon the state capitol building, the number of protesters had mushroomed to an estimated 15,000. The event came to be known as the \\"Last Great March of the Civil Rights Era.\\" It also signaled the beginning of the \\"Black Power\\" movement as Stokely Carmichael made a fiery speech popularizing the slogan following his trespassing arrest in Greenwood, Mississippi. Ross' involvement in publicizing the march and his efforts on behalf of Meredith were chronicled by historian Aram Goudsouzian in his 2014 book Down to the Crossroads: Civil Rights, Black Power and the Meredith March Against Fear. Goudsouzian credits Ross with helping save Meredith's life by threatening the ambulance driver with losing his job if he didn't speed up and rush Meredith to the hospital. Many years later, Meredith himself recognized Ross' contribution in a story published following Ross' death in June 2018. \\"The Mississippi March Against Fear was a big deal primarily because of him,\\" Meredith told the Chicago Sun-Times. \\"Nobody was paying attention. I told him what I was going to do ‚Ä¶He took it serious.\\" Ross approached Meredith about publicizing the march after attending Meredith's announcement at the White House Conference on Civil Rights in Washington, D.C. Many observers considered it a suicide mission, as Meredith had rejected support from major civil rights groups. Following the assassination attempt on Meredith and the subsequent groundswell of support, Dr. King publicly thanked Ross for his efforts on behalf of racial equality. Years later, Ross wrote to a media colleague that his intentions were to have Meredith \\"surrounded by reporters\\" when he trudged through Ku Klux Klan territory \\"so they just couldn't come and shoot him and dump his body in a swamp like the three they murdered in Philadelphia, Miss.\\" Ross made his remarks to a producer at The New American Dream radio show, which devoted a segment of its August 18, 2015, program to his first-hand account of the Meredith march.  From the Daily News to Richard J. Daley  After a stint in the U.S. Air Force resulting in an honorable discharge, Ross attended the University of Miami. He was a member of the UM debate team, which included Gerald Kogan, a future Florida Supreme Court justice and life-long friend. He also wrote copy for the Miami Herald, and had a play, ‚ÄúThe Peacemonger,‚Äù produced at the Miami students‚Äô Box Theater. In 1955, he earned UM's first- ever degree in Race Relations. In 1956, Ross became the first white editor at Ebony magazine. In 1958, he ventured into politics as a speech writer and publicist for Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley. He returned to journalism in 1962, covering urban affairs for the Chicago Daily News and, in 1963, he won and award for best spot news coverage for any Chicago radio station for a documentary on Dr. King's historic ‚ÄúMarch on Washington.‚Äù Inspired by the likes of Chicago community organizer Saul Alinsky, Ross again took a hiatus from journalism and turned to activism and civil rights. In 1964, he left Chicago for New York where he would become news director for the National Urban League led by Whitney Young Jr. He wrote speeches for Young and ghost wrote a syndicated column for Young called ‚ÄúTo Be Equal.‚Äù In one such column from August 1964 titled ‚ÄúA Visit to the Children‚Äôs Zoo,‚Äù Young challenged the publishing industry to end racial stereotyping and to diversify the images of children appearing in books to include blacks and other minorities. Ross also hatched the idea for a \\"Domestic Marshall Plan\\" that Young advocated, calling for investment in U.S. black communities similar to the Marshall Plan to reconstruct Europe after World War II.  WOL's \\"War on slums\\"  In 1965, Ross moved his young family to Washington, D.C., where he became public affairs director for the influential soul music radio station WOL (AM). His impact in that role was colorfully depicted by reporter Carl Bernstein of Watergate fame in a May 1967 profile in the Washington Post's Sunday magazine Potomac. ‚ÄúFinally, there is the legacy of Sherwood Ross, called ‚Äòthe boss with the slum sauce‚Äô by the disc jockeys,‚Äù Bernstein wrote. He added Ross was known by other monikers, among them ‚ÄúRobin Hood of Sherwood Jungle ‚Ä¶ the only honest white man in town ‚Ä¶ the first white guy to get some results.‚Äù Ross created and hosted WOL's public affairs program ‚ÄúSpeak Up,‚Äù which aired from 11 p.m. to 2 a.m. on Sunday nights as part of his effort to empower listeners. Bernstein spotlighted Ross‚Äô ‚ÄúWar on Slums‚Äù in which Ross would drive around the city in his WOL ‚ÄúSlummobile‚Äù and expose substandard housing conditions. Kids would run alongside the car and tell him about vermin-infested apartments. He identified slum landlords on the air and was responsible for the repair of hundreds of dwellings. In the article, Bernstein quoted Ross' on-the-air rant against one such landlord, advising him against evicting a tenant who had called the station to denounce the condition of his rental unit. \\"Slum lord -- you have run-down, rat-infested, raggedy houses all over Washington and I know where they are ... If it takes me a week, if it takes me a month, I will personally inspect every one of your slums and turn my reports over\\" to city building inspectors. Ross told Bernstein that the \\"War on Slums\\" showed it was possible for a radio station to get results on behalf of listeners \\"in an action program that runs counter to some of the city's vested interests.\\" Ross went on to say that \\"soul radio\\" stations such as WOL were a vehicle for civil rights leaders to reach a wider audience.  Public relations man  Ross left WOL that year and soon thereafter founded Sherwood Ross Associates, a national public relations firm that was featured in a 1971 New York Times article titled \\"Public Relations With A Twist.\\" ‚ÄúAt 37, Sherwood Ross has already been a Chicago newspaper reporter, a star of a Washington radio show, a news director for the National Urban League and a press aide to political candidates,‚Äù the Times noted. The article went on to state that Ross‚Äô firm was the first to promote the editorial content of magazines, helping them promote their stories in newspapers, radio and TV. In doing so, he helped many of his clients expand their circulations significantly. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs terrific and he‚Äôs the only public relations man I‚Äôve ever heard editors say anything good about,‚Äù the Times reported, quoting a spokesman for Business Week, one of his many clients. A leading radio analyst called Ross ‚Äúa pioneer‚Äù for his work as a magazine publicist in the 1970s and 1980s, noting that it was \\"groundbreaking\\" at that time for magazines to get their stories quoted with attributions in major newspapers. Ross publicized more than 100 national magazines and his client roster included The Atlantic, Business Week, Harvard Business Review, the New Yorker, The Nation, Playboy, Penthouse, Psychology Today, Inc. Magazine, and Essence. Ross‚Äô work publicizing ‚ÄúThe Education of David Stockman‚Äù for The Atlantic Monthly in 1981 spurred a national debate about the Reagan Administration's philosophy of \\"trickle-down economics\\" and helped boost the sale of the magazine by 100,000 copies. Throughout the 1990s and beyond, Ross continued to work in journalism and public relations. His business column for Reuters News Service was turned into a weekly \\"Workplace\\" column syndicated to U.S. dailies for 10 years. Ross also did public relations for a number of colleges and universities ‚Äì among them Johns Hopkins, Baylor, Kalamazoo College, Miami Dade College, and the Massachusetts School of Law. He was described in a 2000 profile in the Rapid City Journal as \\"A Flack with a Conscience.\\" Sherwood Ross mocks a cardboard cutout of then Pres. George W. Bush near the National Press Club in Washington, DC. (2005)  He \\"Sliced pastrami for the CIA\\"  During the 1980s, Ross was a regular at the Greenwich Village folk music scene and made a name for himself performing offbeat material, such as ‚ÄúNightmare Room,‚Äù ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Go to No Sperm Bank,‚Äù and ‚ÄúI Sliced Pastrami for the CIA (And Found God).\\" Ross had five original songs recorded on the Fast Folk label, which was later published by Smithsonian/ Folkways Records. After Ross moved to Sturgis, South Dakota, in the 1990s, he focused on writing plays ‚Äì including ‚ÄúBaron Giro,‚Äù ‚ÄúYamamoto‚Äôs Decision,‚Äù and ‚ÄúKremlin Wife,‚Äù historical dramas that were met with limited success. \\"Yamamoto's Decision\\" was first read by local actors in Deadwood, South Dakota, and later in Montreal, Canada. ‚ÄúBaron Giro‚Äù was performed at the Live Arts Theater in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2004. However, after returning to Miami in the early 2000s, Ross found a niche for himself as a poet and was a crowd favorite at student poetry slams and other readings. His poem ‚ÄúHiroshima‚Äù was widely republished on the Internet to commemorate the anniversary of the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945. Ross dedicated a tribute poem to James Meredith titled ‚ÄúJesus in Mississippi‚Äù about the 1966 ‚ÄúMarch Against Fear.‚Äù He won several awards from the Florida State Poet's Association, the first in 2013 for his poem titled ‚ÄúBon Voyage‚Äù about the death of a former lover, followed by \\"The Egret\\" and \\"O, Guitar!\\" in 2014, and \\"The Astronomers\\" in 2015. He also wrote anti-war poems such as \\"War No More\\" and \\"America, The Imperial,\\" which can be found on the U.S. Peace Memorial Registry. Sherwood Ross in a playful moment with family in 2015 at the Rancho Luna restaurant in Miami's Little Havana neighborhood  Family history  Ross spent his boyhood in Chicago's Logan Square neighborhood, where he grew up in the same row of buildings as Shel Silverstein, who was three years his senior. Ross‚Äô father, Boris, immigrated to the United States from Kiev after fighting as a teenager in the 1917 Russian Revolution. Even though he fought for the prevailing side in the conflict and suffered stab wounds, Boris Ross was forced to help his family flee Soviet Russia because of continued persecution against Jews. Boris Ross moved to Chicago where he met Sherwood Ross‚Äô mother, Libbe, who later became an elementary school teacher. The family moved to Miami in the late 1940s when Ross was in high school. He graduated from Miami Senior High. Ross married and divorced three times, but had a 30-year relationship with Dolores Curry of Sturgis, S.D. He sired four children and five grandchildren. In 1975, he purchased Woodrow Wilson's former governor's mansion in Princeton, N.J., but lost it in a divorce five years later. He was a New York City YMCA-league squash champion in the early 1970s, and competed in USATF masters track and field events well into his 80s. He died in June 2018 from injuries resulting from a traumatic fall in July 2016 that happened while he was walking to the gym in his Little Havana neighborhood.

Stamp was born in Catonsville, Maryland. Stamp grew up in Catonsville, approximately 20 miles from the University of Maryland, College Park campus where she would work for nearly four decades. She attended St. Timothy's School and Western High School.  Early career and college education  Between 1913 and 1915, Stamp taught physical education at Catonsville High School. During the summers of 1914 and 1915, she enrolled in a \\"College Courses for Teachers\\" program at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. Stamp then enrolled at Sophie Newcomb College (the women's school associated with Tulane University). She spent the summers of 1915 and 1916 teaching physical education at Alfred University (in western New York State), and she returned to Maryland in the summer of 1917 to serve as summer school instructor at the University of Maryland. = World War I = As World War I approached, Stamp applied her experience as a recreation director and classwork in sociology as a social worker for the War Work Council of the Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA), where she formed recreation programs for female factory workers.

In 1921, Stamp graduated from with a degree in sociology. After graduation, Stamp accepted a position with the Red Cross as a field representative in the South. Soon after, University of Maryland president Albert F. Woods offered her the position of Dean of Women, which she accepted.  Academic career at the University of Maryland = Dean of women of the University of Maryland (1922‚Äì1960) = Stamp served as Dean of Women at the University of Maryland, College Park for 38 years. She initially took the position as a one-year contract, which was renewed for a second year before being extended to comprise the remainder of her career. The university had just begun admitting women in 1916. During Stamp's tenure as Dean of Women, enrollment of female students increased from 93 in 1922 to approximately 4,000 in 1960. In 1923, she organized the Maryland State Association of Deans of Women, which soon gained membership from neighboring Delaware, Virginia, and Washington, DC. In 1924, Stamp earned a master's degree in sociology at the University of Maryland, where she completed a thesis entitled \\"Community Organization in Maryland Welfare Organization.\\" She undertook additional graduate work at Catholic University of America and American University. During her time as dean of women, Stamp founded or helped to found many organizations: * Women's Student Government Association at Maryland * Campus Club * Senior Honor Society (later renamed Mortar Board) * Freshman Honor Society (later renamed Alpha Lambda Delta) * Student chapter of the American Red Cross = Dean of women emeritus, University of Maryland (1960‚Äì1974) = When Stamp retired in December 1960, the University of Maryland Board of Regents awarded Stamp the title dean of women emeritus.

The administrative centre was the village of B√∏rsa where B√∏rsa Church is located. History The parish of B√∏rsa was established as a civil municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). On 1 January 1890, the municipality was divided into two: B√∏rseskognen (population: 1,410) in the south and B√∏rsa (population: 2,300) in the north.

During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1965, the neighboring municipalities of B√∏rsa (population: 1,476), Skaun (population: 1,251), and Buvik (population: 1,267) were merged to form the new, larger municipality of Skaun.

This was enough to close the airport for a time during the day and more than 200 flights were scrapped by late morning. Also on an autobahn north of Frankfurt, heavy snow contributed to an enormous vehicle-pile involving more than 100 cars and injuring at least 20 people. =France= France was worst affected with up to of snowfall in Northern parts of the country. Also, it was cold too with the maximum temperature in Paris being just . The heavy snow and high winds led to nearly a third of France‚Äôs regions being on alert and the government activated a ministerial crisis group. More than 2,000 people were stranded in their cars overnight as heavy snow paralysed roads in Normandy and Brittany, with many spending the night in emergency shelters. Also, about 80,000 homes in the north and northwest of France were without power. The snow caused major disruptions as it moved into Paris, with authorities urging the seven million commuters who use public transport every day to stay home. Several major roads around the capital were closed and the city‚Äôs two main airports, Charles de Gaulle and Orly, said they had cancelled up to a quarter of flights and the nearby Beauvais airport, serving mainly low-cost airlines, cancelled all flights. Conditions were also very difficult on the roads, a traffic accident near Lille injured 14 people. Also 58-year-old homeless man was found dead, presumably from the cold, outside a building in the town of Saint-Brieuc in Brittany. =England= Hundreds were also stuck in their cars overnight in Southern England, some for more than 10 hours as ice, snow and freezing winds descended on southeastern England. Maximum temperatures were as low as in some places along with more than of snowfall. =Belgium and The Netherlands= In Belgium, the snowstorms caused massive traffic disruptions, with vehicles backed up on 1,600 kilometres (1,000 miles) of freeways due to snowdrifts and ice. Buses and trains were cancelled or delayed in Brussels and other towns and the high-speed Thalys service linking Paris and Brussels was suspended. Long traffic jams because of snow and ice also snaked along motorways in the southern Netherlands, hampering travel to and from Belgium after an unseasonal fall of more than 10 centimetres (four inches) of snow overnight.

Spilker Jr. attended Stanford University for 5 years under scholarships, obtained Deans Honors and Hewlett Packard Fellowship, and received BS Degree in 1955, MS Degree in 1956, and Ph.D. in 1958 all in Electrical Engineering. He completed the Senior Management Program at UCLA in 1985.  Career  From 1958 to 1963, Spilker worked as a research supervisor at Lockheed Research Labs in Palo Alto, California, where he invented an optimal tracking device for spread-spectrum signals and devised technology to communicate with aircraft flying to/from Berlin when Russia blockaded Berlin. In 1963 he became manager of the Communications Sciences Department of Ford Aerospace Corporation where he led and managed efforts on both satellite communications ground terminals and military communications satellite payloads for the first quasi-stationary communications satellites, and developed multiple access technologies for various satellite communications and became Director of Communications Systems. In 1973 he co-founded Stanford Telecommunications Inc. (referred to as Stanford Telecom) with Marshall Fitzgerald and John Brownie. Stanford Telecom was the first of his three Silicon Valley startup companies, with three people and no VC funding. As the company's Executive Chairman, he grew the military satellite communications and GPS company to over 1,300 employees in 5 states when he sold it in 1999. During Spilker's leadership at Stanford Telecommunications Inc., he also designed semiconductor ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits) for error correction, number- controlled oscillators, and quadrature amplitude modulation. Aviation Week and Space Technology in 1997 ranked Stanford Telecom as the #2 most competitive aerospace company in the world and top 100 fastest growing companies.

He was also co-founder and chairman of Rosum, a high-tech company using digital and analog television signals for indoor positioning services and augmentation of GPS. James and Anna Marie Spilker at the Stanford building dedication in 2013 In 2012, Spilker and his wife, Anna Marie Spilker, a real estate broker and investor, donated $28 million to Stanford University to gift The James and Anna Marie Spilker Engineering and Applied Sciences Building and endow a professorship in the School of Engineering. The building is one of four new structures in Stanford Science and Engineering Quad. Spilker has been a member of the Stanford University Engineering advisory board, a member of the University of Southern California (USC) Communication Sciences Institute, a member of the US Defense Science Board GPS Task Force, and the Air Force Space Command GPS Independent Review Team. Spilker was an invited lecturer and keynote speaker at Samsung Corporation in Korea (2003), Tsinghua University in Beijing, China (2010), the Marconi lab near Bologna, Italy (1970s), and in Munich and Berlin, Germany (2011). Spilker was a Member of the National Academy of Engineering (NAE), a member of the NAE Peer Review Committee of the NAE for Electronics, a Life Fellow of the IEEE, and has been the Chairman of the IEEE Technical Advisory Committee.  Technical contributions = Delay-lock discriminator ‚Äì an optimal tracking system = In 1961, Spilker published an IRE paper (the predecessor of the IEEE) showing that the optimal tracking system was the delay lock loop (DLL), not the early-late-gate type of delay discriminator. Instead the optimal DLL uses the differentiated signal as the reference and the conventional early-late-gate discriminator is only optimal for a trapezoidal pseudonoise wave shape. = Civil navigation and time ‚Äì GPS signal structure = Absolutely critical to the success of GPS for the civil community, which is by far the largest user of GPS navigation, is its ability to operate in a multiple-access environment. This is achieved by allowing all GPS satellites broadcasting to users on the Earth at the same frequency without interfering with one another using code-division multiple access (CDMA). With CDMA, each satellite transmits in a common spectral band with a noise-like pseudorandom signal. Each satellite transmits a different code with properties that its code has little interference with codes from other satellites. The US Air Force GPS Joint Program Office gave Spilker and his small team of two the contract to recommend the GPS satellite signal structure, especially the civil signal called the clear/acquisition (CA) signal for the civil community. The same signal architecture is also used as the acquisition signal for the GPS military signal. Code families with this low crosscorrelation property have been used for years in fixed point-to-point ground or geostationary satellites and today in cellphones with negligible Doppler shift. These can be easily analyzed using Galois field theory. However, as Spilker pointed out, that zero-Doppler analysis does not apply to GPS with its rapidly moving satellites, and does not reveal the worst case limits of performance. Therefore, critical to the success of GPS is the use of relatively short CDMA codes. Spilker and his team analyzed the worst-case cross-correlation between codes for the L band GPS signals with their +/- 5 kHz Doppler offsets and clearly show that the codes with Doppler offset indeed were the worst case, and he recommended the 1023-period codes even though with no Doppler they were no better than the 511-period codes. Those 1023-period codes are the C/A codes now supporting more than 2 billion users. Spilker's results were first published in the Stanford Telecom document for the Air Force, \\"Defense Navigation Satellite Special Study\\", 130 page Report, April, 1974. = Precision satellite test receiver for testing C/A and P code satellite transmissions = Upon initial launch of the first GPS satellites, there was the need to assure that the precise signal modulation matched bit- by-bit and chip-by-chip with the desired signal. This measurement required a large tracking antenna and special receiver. Since the satellites are exposed to Van Allen belt radiation and vibration effects at launch, these were important tests. Spilker and his team at Stanford Telecommunications successfully designed, implemented, and carried our these GPS in-orbit tests to assure that the P-code chips and other signals were precisely correct. = Time-gated GPS pseudolite transmitter with rubidium clock and a calibration receiver = Even though at the time there were four GPS satellites in orbit, plus on-orbit spares, one of the initial operational tests was to track a navy missile precisely. For this reason, there was an advantage to have a ground- based pseudolite at a fixed site that transmitted the GPS signals in a time- gated manner so as not to interfere with satellite transmissions most of the time. Spilker and his team developed a precision GPS pseudolite that also included a rubidium standard clock for this signal generator and a calibration receiver to assure that the signal matched a selected GPS satellite code. This time-gated pseudolite signal along with the in-orbit GPS satellites permitted precisely tracking of the navy missile and the program was a success. = GPS initial operational control segment = The operational GPS control segment is crucial to GPS to compute precision orbits and clock errors for each of the GPS satellites ‚Äì information that must be transmitted to each and every GPS receiver with precision. Spilker proposed, designed, and implemented special monitor station receivers, part of the new IBM/Stanford Telecom control segment that performed precision coherent code/carrier satellite tracking from horizon to horizon with GPS pseudorange rms error of only 7 mm. This performance is described by IBM in the Parkinson/Spilker GPS book.Global Positioning System: Theory and Applications, B. Parkinson and J. J. Spiker Jr., editors, AIAA, 1996 = Precision civil signal at L5 frequency band ‚Äì GPS modernization = The initial GPS civil signal operated only on one frequency at L1 band (1.57542 GHz). It did not permit computation of the excess delay of the ionosphere and only operated at the lower clock rate of 1.023 M chip/s. The modernized GPS civil signal was designed by Spilker and A. J. van Dierendonck, who received the ION Burka award for their contribution. This so- called L5 signal operates on a lower L band frequency and has a 10 times higher clock rate and a longer period thus permitting ionospheric delay correction when used with the L1 frequency and a greater accuracy with the higher chip rate. It further operates in an aeronautical navigation protected frequency band L5. The new GPS/GNSS L5 civil signal will be used for precision navigation by the world's airliners and many new precision navigation applications. = GPS vector-processing receivers in an era of multi-GNSS = The 21st century world of satellite navigation includes not only a modernized GPS but also global navigation satellite constellations from Russia (GLONASS), China (BDS), Europe (Galileo), and regional systems from Japan (QZSS), and India (IRNSS). With these GNSS and RNSS constellations plus GPS, the world will have more than 132 satellites in orbit and if each has at least 2 civil signals there will be more than 264 navigation signals being broadcast. Spilker pointed out that from a communication theory point of view there is an alternative to tracking each satellite one at a time as separate estimates. Instead he considers the composite of all signals as a single composite signal which is now simply a function of the user's state vector which includes at least the user's position and velocity vectors. The receiver for such a system he defines as the vector delay-lock loop. This receiver operates on the total power received from the entire set of satellites of satellite constellation, not just the power of a single satellite. The gain of the vector processing which tracks the user state vector in a single step is greater than would have been feasible years ago but now computer chips are many times faster. Vector processing can have many advantages for disadvantaged users in challenging environments such as in urban canyons, under forest canopy, during space weather disturbances. = Vector-processing anti-spoof techniques for civil users = The civil signals are based on clear unencrypted codes published and available to all. A terrorist or other troublemakers can attempt to jam or spoof the true signal. The spoofer would attempt to transmit a similar signal so that it is received by the user with a similar delay and Doppler shift to the true signal. This is a very simple operation if the user is employing a conventional receiver that tracks each satellite signal separately one at a time with a separate correlator for each satellite. However, with vector processing the problem is quite different ‚Äì we are now tracking the composite of all 134 satellites in parallel. The spoofer now must generate spoofing signals that match the user state vector delay for all or most of the satellites ‚Äì a task of enormous difficulty. For example, if the signal has a 10 Mcps chip rate, the user state vector position estimate in 3D must be matched the spoofer to less than roughly 20 meters in all 3 dimensions and also very precisely in the velocity vector especially if the user has a good clock. Thus vector processing can provide enormous benefits to protect the user from spoofing attacks.

He joined the Northwest Army of the warlord Feng Yuxiang in 1929, before participating in the Ningdu uprising and defecting to the Communist Red Army in 1931. He fought in the Red Army's Long March, the Second Sino-Japanese War where he was credited with devising a trench warfare tactic that helped destroy enemy pillboxes, and the Chinese Civil War. After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Wang served as the first chief of staff of the PLA Air Force and then the first Minister of the Seventh Ministry of Machine Building, in charge of China's ballistic missile program. During the Cultural Revolution, he replaced Marshall Nie Rongzhen as the acting director of the Science and Technology Commission of the National Defense Ministry, in charge of China's nuclear tests and the launch of its first satellite. However, in the aftermath of Marshall Lin Biao's alleged coup attempt and subsequent death in October 1971, Wang was purged and imprisoned for ten years. He was released in 1981 and discharged from the army without being prosecuted or convicted of a crime.  Early life and Guominjun  Wang Bingzhang was born on 14 January 1914 into a peasant family in Anyang, Henan Province. Owing to poverty, he dropped out of school second year in junior high school and apprenticed at a blacksmith's shop. In September 1929, Wang enlisted in the Guominjun (Northwest Army) of the warlord Feng Yuxiang and trained as a radio operator. After Chiang Kai-shek defeated Feng in the Central Plains War in 1930, Chiang took over the Guominjun, reorganized it as the 26th Route Army, and dispatched it to Jiangxi to participate in the third encirclement campaign against the Jiangxi Soviet. On 14 December 1931, the 26th Army rebelled against Chiang in the Ningdu uprising and defected to the Chinese Red Army. It became the Fifth Army Group of the Red Army, greatly strengthening the Communist forces. Wang joined the Communist Youth League in 1932 and the Communist Party in 1935. He served in the Fifth and later the First Army Group of the Red Army, and participated in the army's Long March to Northern Shaanxi.  Second Sino-Japanese War  During the Second Sino- Japanese War, Wang served in the 115th Division of the Eighth Route Army commanded by Lin Biao, and fought in the battles of Pingxingguan, Guangyang, Wucheng, and Jinggou. In 1939 his division was deployed in Shandong to set up a guerrilla base in the Japanese-occupied province. After September 1940, he became acting commander of the Third Brigade and then commander of the Fourth Brigade in charge of the 11th military subdistrict. In December 1942, Wang was appointed commander of the Fourth Brigade and of the Communist base in Huxi (), located southwest of Shandong. The area was under frequent attacks from the Japanese, the pro-Japanese Wang Jingwei regime, and the Kuomintang forces. Wang devised the jiaotonghao () tactic using a network of interconnected trenches from which to attack the enemies' pillbox system. In the \\"Anti- Pillbox Battle\\" in July 1943, Wang's brigade, by using his tactic, reportedly inflicted nearly 10,000 enemy casualties while losing around 100 men. Mao Zedong later personally praised Wang for his performance in Shandong. In late 1944, Wang led three regiments of the Eighth Route Army south to support the New Fourth Army. He made a report on his trench tactic, which was circulated by the Fourth Division of the New Fourth Army as a booklet titled Jiaotonghao Attacks (). Zhang Zhen, chief of staff of the Fourth Division, wrote its preface and praised jiaotonghao as an innovative and effective tactic.  Chinese Civil War  The Second Sino-Japanese War ended with the surrender of Japan in 1945; Civil War soon resumed between the Kuomintang and the Communists. During the war, Wang successively served as deputy commander and chief of staff of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Military District, commander of the district, commander of the 11th Column, and commander of the 17th Corps of the Second Field Army, participating in many battles including the Huaihai Campaign and the Yangtze River Crossing Campaign. His anti-pillbox jiaotonghao tactic was widely propagated in the People's Liberation Army (PLA) and was credited with helping the PLA win many battles, including the sieges of Yixian and Jinzhou in the Liaoshen Campaign, the battles against Huang Baitao, Huang Wei, and Du Yuming in the Huaihai Campaign, and the Battle of Tianjin in the Pingjin Campaign.  Early People's Republic of China  After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Wang assisted commander Liu Yalou with the establishment of the People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF), as its first chief of staff. In 1951, he accompanied Xu Xiangqian to Moscow to negotiate with the Soviet Union for the purchase of the MiG 15 fighter planes. In 1953, he was the first-ranked deputy commander of the PLAAF. During the Korean War, when the PLAAF suffered high casualties in May 1953, Wang was tasked with analyzing and rescuing the situation. In 1955, Wang was among the first group of PLA commanders to be awarded the rank of lieutenant general. In April 1960, he was appointed deputy director of the Fifth Academy of the Ministry of National Defense, which was in charge of China's embryonic ballistic missile and satellite programs and, later, promoted to director. When the Fifth Academy was reorganized into the Seventh Ministry of Machine Building (the \\"missile ministry\\") in January 1965, Chairman Liu Shaoqi appointed Wang as the inaugural minister; his six deputies included the famed scientist Qian Xuesen. Under Wang's command, China successfully launched its first missile, the Dongfeng-1, in November 1960, and the Dongfeng-2 to Dongfeng-5 followed.  Cultural Revolution  When the Cultural Revolution erupted in 1966, Wang came under attack by the radical September 16 or 916 Group of the Red Guards. On 23 January 1967, the 916 Group, under the ringleader Ye Zhengguang (a son of the famous general Ye Ting), launched a coup in the Seventh Ministry. Wang refused Ye's demand to surrender the Ministry's official seals, the symbols of its authority, but the rebels used a blowtorch to cut open the safety box where the seals were kept and ousted Wang. Wang avoided serious repercussions, likely due to the protection by the pro-establishment New September 15 Group and by Marshall Nie Rongzhen, director of the Science and Technology Commission of the National Defense Ministry (NDSTC). He was rescued after being held by various Red Guard factions for four months and suddenly disappeared, ostensibly being hospitalized for medical treatment. He did not re-emerge until October 1968. After Nie himself was purged in 1968, Mao Zedong appointed Wang as the acting director of the NDSTC. In this role, he commanded ten nuclear tests in Northwest China. In April 1970, China's first satellite, the Dong Fang Hong I, was successfully placed in orbit by the Long March 1 rocket, which was based on the design of the Dongfeng-4. In October 1971, however, Wang was purged in the wake of Marshal Lin Biao's alleged coup attempt and subsequent death. He was labeled a \\"sworn follower\\" of Lin and imprisoned.  Later life and death  Wang was held in the Qincheng Prison from 1971 until his release in 1981. In 1982, the Procuratorate of the People's Liberation Army announced that it would not press charges against him but discharged him from the PLA. He died on 25 September 2005 in Beijing, at the age of 91. Because of a dispute between his family and the Chinese government regarding the official treatment of his funeral, his body remained frozen in the hospital morgue for 12 years. His funeral was finally held on 31 May 2017 at the People's Liberation Army General Hospital (301 Hospital) in Beijing.  Honours  In 1955, Wang was awarded the Second Class Medal of the Order of Bayi, the First Class Medal of the Order of Independence and Freedom, and the First Class Medal of the Order of Liberation.

During Operation Barbarossa, it was subordinated to the SS and deployed in German-occupied areas, specifically the Army Group Centre Rear Area, of the Soviet Union, as part of Police Regiment Centre. Alongside detachments from the Einsatzgruppen and the SS Cavalry Brigade, it perpetrated mass murder during the Holocaust and was responsible for large-scale crimes against humanity targeting civilian populations. In mid-1942, the battalion was reassigned to the 5th Police Regiment and operated in German-occupied territories of Slovenia. Background and formation The German Order Police (uniformed police) was a key instrument of the security apparatus of Nazi Germany. In the prewar period, Heinrich Himmler, the head of the SS, and Kurt Daluege, chief of the Order Police, cooperated in transforming the police force of the Weimar Republic into militarised formations ready to serve the regime's aims of conquest and racial annihilation. The police units participated in the annexation of Austria and the occupation of Czechoslovakia. Police troops were first formed into battalion-sized formations for the 1939 invasion of Poland, where they were deployed for security and policing purposes, also taking part in executions and mass deportations. Twenty-three Order Police battalions were slated to take part in the 1941 invasion of the Soviet Union, Operation Barbarossa. Nine were attached to security divisions of the Wehrmacht. Two battalions were assigned to support the Einsatzgruppen, the mobile death squads of the SS, and the Organisation Todt, the military construction group. Twelve were formed into regiments, three battalions each, and designated as Police Regiments Centre, North, South, and Special Purpose. The goals of the police battalions were to secure the rear by eliminating the remnants of the enemy forces, guarding the prisoners of war, and protecting the lines of communications and captured industrial facilities. Their instructions also included, as Daluege stated, the \\"combat of criminal elements, above all political elements\\". Along with Police Battalions 307 and 316, Police Battalion 322 was assigned to Police Regiment Centre. Comprising about 550 men, the battalion was raised from recruits mobilised from the 1905‚Äì1915 year groups. They were led by career police professionals, steeped in the ideology of Nazism, driven by anti-semitism and anti-Bolshevism. The regiment was placed under the command of , a career policeman. When it crossed the German- Soviet border, the regiment came under the control of Erich von dem Bach- Zelewski, the Higher SS and Police Leader (HSS-PF) for Army Group Centre. Operational history Himmler made a personal visit to the headquarters of Police Regiment Centre in Belostok on 8 July where he spoke to Montua, Bach- Zalewski and the regiment's officers. The same evening, a company of Police Battalion 322 participated in the shooting of about 1,000 Jews under the direction of Einsatzgruppe B. On 10 July, Daluege visited the unit and addressed the members of the regiment arrayed in a parade formation, extolling them to \\"exterminate\\" Bolshevism as a \\"blessing for Germany\\". On 11 July, Montua passed a confidential order from Bach-Zalewski to the battalion commanders that Jews, who had been \\"convicted of looting\\", were to be shot; an execution took place the same day. Around this time, Police Battalions 316 and 322 rounded up approximately 3,000 Jewish men from Belostok and shot them in a nearby forest. On 17 July, the regiment murdered over 1,100 Jews in Slonim, with Bach-Zalewski reporting to Himmler on 18 July: \\"Yesterday's cleansing action in Slonim by Police Regiment Centre. 1,153 Jewish plunderers were shot\\". By 20 July, the unit's reports referred to executions of Jewish women and children. By late August, Police Battalion 322 moved to Minsk, where, on September 1, it conducted a killing operation together with the units of Einsatzgruppe B. The victims included 290 Jewish men and 40 Jewish women. Wehrmacht propaganda photograph of the Jewish women in Mogilev, July 1941. Mogilev Jews were murdered by Police Battalion 322 in October 1941. In September 1941, the regiment participated in the Mogilev conference, organised by General Max von Schenckendorff, commander of the Army Group Centre Rear Area, with assistance from Montua. The conference included three field exercises. On the second day, participants travelled to a nearby settlement where a company of Police Battalion 322, assisted by the troops of the SD, conducted a demonstration of how to surround and screen a village. According to the after-action report, \\"suspicious strangers\\" (Ortsfremde) or \\"partisans\\" could not be found. The screening of the population revealed fifty-one Jewish civilians, of whom thirty-two were shot. On 2 October 1941, Police Battalion 322, along with Bach-Zalewski's staff company and Ukrainian auxiliaries, rounded up 2,200 Jews in the Mogilev ghetto. Sixty-five were killed during the roundups, and another 550 executed the next day. Throughout the rest of the month, the battalion continued to execute Jews, communists, and alleged partisans in the vicinity of Mogilev. The commander of the unit received the Iron Cross, 2nd class, following these operations. In December, after the German defeat in the Battle of Moscow, the regiment was sent to the front lines to reinforce the German defenses, thus depriving Bach-Zalewski of manpower. The battalion was assigned to guard and security duties to the immediate rear of the front-line troops. In May‚ÄìJune 1942, Police Battalions 307, 316, and 322 were reassigned to other regiments and continued to engage in security warfare and genocide. Battalion 322 was sent to the German- occupied territories of Slovenia, where it became part of the 5th SS Police Regiment. Aftermath The Order Police as a whole had not been declared a criminal organisation by the Allies, unlike the SS, and its members were able to reintegrate into society largely unmolested, with many returning to police careers in Austria and West Germany. Personnel of Police Battalion 322 were investigated by the West German authorities in the 1960s. One of the battalion's members stated: > \\"The expression 'combat of the partisans' is strictly speaking a complete > misnomer. We did not have a single battle with partisans after we left > Mogilev. ... The fact of the matter [was] that those found without identity > cards sufficed for their arrest and executions\\".

Background Starting in 1997 the Mexican professional wrestling, company AAA has held a major wrestling show late in the year, either November or December, called Guerra de Titanes (\\"War of the Titans\\"). The show often features championship matches or Lucha de Apuestas or bet matches where the competitors risked their wrestling mask or hair on the outcome of the match. In Lucha Libre the Lucha de Apuetas match is considered more prestigious than a championship match and a lot of the major shows feature one or more Apuesta matches. The Guerra de Titanes show is hosted by a new location each year, emanating from cities such as Madero, Chihuahua, Chihuahua, Mexico City, Guadalajara, Jalisco and more.

Puggaard & Co. in 1813. The company became a leading wholesaler of grain and was also active in the market for import of colonial goods such as coffee and especially sugar. Puggaard's wife, Bolette Puggaard n√©e Hage, a daughter of Christopher Friedenreich Hage, was a painter. The couple supported many of the artists of the Danish Golden Age. A daughter married Orla Lehmann. Early life and education Puggard was born in Copenhagen in poor conditions. His parents were Thomas Puggaard (1748-1818) and Cathrine Marie Puggaard n√©e Svane (1754-1814. His father was assistant cantor at the Church of Holmen and owner of the punch bar at the Royal Theatre on Kongens Nytorv. He was initially not sent to school but had to assist in his father's punch bar, but later attended Det von Westenske Institut in N√∏rregade. He had aspirations to become a merchant but was unable to find an apprenticeship and therefore trained as a surveyor before he was employed as a clerk in the head office at Classen's Frederiksv√¶rk. He began his career in trade by receiving small commissions for bringing goods along on his journeys between Frederiksv√¶rk and Copenhagen. When Puggaard acted as secretary for Eilert Tscherning's on his journey to Sweden in 1812, he used the opportunity to buy up English products that were unavailable in Denmark at the time. H. Puggaard & Co. In 1813, Puggaard was finally licensed as merchant and established his own trading house. He went on numerous journeys to Sweden, Hamburg, England and seaports on the Baltic Sea. Puggaard specialized in exporting grain from the countries around the Baltic Sea to England but also traded in timber, herring and wine. Johannes Hage in 1849 Puggaard's marriage to Bolette Hage, a daughter of Christopher Friedenreich Hage a business partner on M√∏n, was also a key event in the development of his company. The marriage strengthened the business relationship between the two families and Puggaard later employed his brother-in-law Alfred Hage as head of his company's activities in Nakskov and he later became a partner in the company. The Nakskov branch operated its own fleet. In 1823, it consisted of two schooners, Caroline and Anette Hage', both built in Nakskov, the brig Bolette Puggaard, the barque Johannes Hage and schooner brig (skonnertbriggen) Hother. Hans Puggaard's son, Rudolph Puggaard, joined the Nakskov office in 1839 and worked in a leading position at the head office in Copenhagen from 1842. Trade in grain remained the most important business area but the company was also a major importer of colonial goods, such as coffee and sugar, and later also engaged in banking. Puggaard and Hage had many disagreements and the younger Hage gradually came to play a more dominant role in the company. =Shipping= In 1865, shortly prior to Hans Puggaard's death but after he was no longer active in the company, H. Puggaard & Co. was a co-founder of Det Kj√∏benhavnske Skibsrederi. The following ships were either owned by H.

The company mainly sold annuities and some life insurance policies. In the late 1980s, the business was failing, and they were threatened by regulators to be shut down. Due to fraud and bad business dealings they, were liquidated in 1996.  History  National Heritage Life (NHL), headquarters located in Orlando, Florida, specialized in the sale of tax-deferred annuities and interest-sensitive life insurance products. At the time of liquidation they had approximately 20,595 annuity contracts and 3,888 life policy contracts from policyholders. In late 1989, National Heritage reported an operating loss and 27% reduction of capital from a decline of sales, and in 1990, insurance regulators threatened to shut down the company if it did not raise additional capital.United States v. Weiss, Case No. 6:98-cr-99-PCF-KRS. Judgment Doc. 1372. A group of investors offered $4 million to satisfy regulators, in exchange for a controlling interest in National Heritage. The group provided a $4 million check, but once in control of National Heritage, transferred $3 million from National Heritage to help cover the check. This began a long series of schemes in which millions were stolen from National Heritage by the group of investors. Bad investments further depleted National Heritage capital. In 1993, the group decided to cover up all the missing money by a \\"mortgage-backed bond scheme\\". Weiss (not part of the original investment group) was contracted to purchase discounted mortgages with National Heritage funds, which were put into a mortgage-backed bond. It was believed that the discounted mortgages could be rehabilitated, and thus make a profit. The bond was fraudulently placed on National Heritage books with inflated values. In 1994, the Delaware Insurance Department did a full examination of the company and placed it in receivership. Three corporations and 13 individuals were convicted, including Weiss.Susan Clary, Orlando Sentinel, 2000 \\"Insurance Crooks To Serve Life - Plus\\" The FBI Section Chief for Financial Crimes stated in 2001 that National Heritage was the largest insurance company failure in U.S. history, resulting $450 million of losses. A 2000 New York Times article stated that Weiss was part of \\"an immense fraud scheme that siphoned $450 million\\" from the insurance company. However, Best's Review, the insurance industry monthly magazine, explains that it had $420 million in liabilities to its policyholders, which were covered by state guarantee funds, and were due to a mixture of theft and bad investments. The $450 (or $420) million figure cited above in media reports and the FBI is the \\"gross\\" amount of National Heritage liabilities covered by state guarantee funds, recovery of National Heritage assets. According to an order by the Delaware Court of Chancery granting liquidation, at the time National Heritage went into receivership in 1994, it had $214 million in liabilities above its assets.https://insurance.delaware.gov/wp- content/uploads/sites/15/2017/01/3-NHL-LiquidInjOrder-11-95.pdf The Receiver noted in court submissions (exhibits A-C) that National Heritage recovered $235 million, and reimbursed state guarantee funds $229 million.https://insurance.delaware.gov/wp- content/uploads/sites/15/2017/01/4-NHLPetitionGAOmnClaimsAgr-6-09.pdf The policyholders of National Heritage were fully reimbursed by 2000. The National Heritage financial collapse was alleged to be the largest \\"insurance failure\\" in history, an untrue \\"fact\\" and a narrative that the prosecutors and the FBI have been making to justify the large white-collar sentence that Weiss and his co-defendant received. The insurance company didn't have any financial loss, after all, assets were liquidated the insurance company realized a gain. The sentence imposed on Weiss is believed to be the longest known to have ever been imposed for a white-collar crime. The financial collapse of National Heritage Life Insurance Company was caused by mismanagement, bad investments, and embezzlement by officers of the company. Weiss, who was not an officer of NHLC, was contracted by these officers as a financial consultant to restore the health of the company. Ultimately, getting involved led to his conviction of money laundering in the \\"mortgage-backed bond scheme\\".

The 12th century temple is unique in its style and of its period because it is built in central Indian Malwa style, bhumija, without influence of Paramara architecture and with influence of Gujarati Chaulukya architecture. It has a square garbhagriha (shrine proper) as well as octagonal mandapa (dancing hall). Location The temple is located at the confluence of the Galta or Galti and Mahi rivers near Sarnal village. The temple received its name from the Galta river. History Hasmukh Sankalia has identified it with the Chalukya architecture based on its circular shrine proper, crucifix-form dancing hall and the ornamentation. Madhusudan Dhaky disputed it and mentioned the Gujarati architectural influence in shikhara and moldings and decorations on its basement and wall proper. Dhaky opines that the temple may have been constructed by someone who did not have first-hand information of the bhumija style of Malwa and rather depended on the Gujarat texts which treats bhumija style in Gujarati architecture. Aparajtaprccha is one such 12th century Gujarati text based on the Malwa text Samarangana Sutradhara. So the temple must have been constructed in the 12th century. The moldings, decorations, and the sculptures resemble the Kumarapala Temple at Somnath and other shrines built in 12th century during the reign of the Chaulukya ruler Kumarapala. The temple is associated with Galav, the Rishi from Puranas and a devoted king Chandrahas from Hindu mythology. The temple is the Monument of National Importance (N-GJ-144) protected by the Archaeological Survey of India. Architecture The Galteshwar temple is a bhumija style temple which is rarest known of Gujarat. The bhumija style was the popular style in the regions under the rule of Malwa. The temple is also rare ashtabhadra or ashtashala plan bhumija temple found rarely even in central India such as the temple at Arang. The temple is completely devoid of the Paramara influence. The temple is nirandhara type having the garbhagriha (shrine proper) and the mandapa (dancing hall). =Garbhagriha= The shrine proper is located lower to the level of the mandapa and is square from inside. From outside, the shrine is circular with a diameter of 24 feet with numerous projections and recesses. The recesses have seven niches with the images of Dikpalas, the guardian deities of the eight directions. The front wall of the shrine proper is carved with ornamentation and figures which include different forms of Shiva which are now badly mutilated. The doorway is profusely ornamented with rupastambhas of Abu style. The figures and carvings include gandharvas, ascetics, horse riders, elephant riders, chariots, palanquins and the events of life, from birth to death. =Mandapa= leftKarotaka, circular ceiling with Gajtalu and Karnadardarika The eight-sided mandapa has several projecting angles similar to Chaulukya temples in Gujarat like the sun temple of Modhera, Somnath temple and Sejakpur temple. The mandapa is in the crucifix form. It has three bhujas instead of usual two bhujas in the rear part. There are eight inner pillars and sixteen outer smaller pillars which supports the roof of the mandapa. The smaller pillars have the smaller shaft, capital, and the brackets. The inner pillars have a square base with cut corners followed by two small necks. It is followed by the square shaft for the one-third height of the pillar, then octagonal for the half of the height of the pillar, then smaller sixteen sided shaft and then a circular shaft decorated with a band of the kirtimukhas. It is crowned by the capital with dripping leaves ornamentation separated from the shaft by the narrow neck. The brackets have dwarfs and the kirtimukhas. The sub-capital is vase shaped and the brackets is ornamented with dwarfs and volutes. They do not have padmashila carving. The shikhara as well as the mandapa collapsed in 1908. The shikhara was also bhumija in interpretation and Gujarat style components such as kutastambhikas and shringas. The surasenaka of bhumija styled shikhara is also present but its morphology is different than the Paramara style.

The site is bounded by Edgar Street to the south, Greenwich Street to the west, and Trinity Place to the east. It is named after Robert Dickey, a 19th-century New York merchant, and his wife Anne, who both resided in the house. Erected circa 1810, it is one of the few remaining Federal-style buildings in the city, and was designated a New York City Landmark in 2005. Currently in disrepair, the building is slated for renovation and conversion into a school as part of the construction of the adjacent 77 Greenwich Street. Description The Dickey House is located at the south end of a block bounded by Edgar Street to the south, Greenwich Street to the west, and Trinity Place to the east, with Rector Street at the north end of the block. Adjacent to the north of the building was a former Syms Corporation store, demolished in 2017. This is the site of the future 77 Greenwich Street tower. Located to the south across Edgar Street is Elizabeth H. Berger Plaza. Also immediately to the south are the approaches to the Brooklyn‚ÄìBattery Tunnel. The building was designed by an unknown architect in Federal architecture style. The design has been erroneously attributed to Pierre Charles L'Enfant. As originally constructed the house was 3 stories tall, with the top story occupied by a peaked roof. An 1872 alteration by architect Detlef Lienau replaced the peaked roof with a fourth story capped by a flat roof with a metal cornice. The front face of the building on Greenwich Street is flat and four-windows wide. The bottom floor is utilized for retail space. The rear face of the building on Trinity Street is five bays wide. It features an \\"elliptical\\" or \\"bow-shaped\\" facade, which occupies the northernmost three windows and extends outward towards the street. This was an original design feature, and the 1872 remodeling maintained this element for the fourth floor. The elliptical design has been compared to that of buildings in Boston. The ellipse originally faced a garden on the property. The south facade on Edgar Street contains a chimney and no windows. It was originally adjacent to another building, until that building was demolished and Edgar Street was relocated north to front the building during the construction of the Battery Tunnel in the 1940s. Windows may have existed on this face in the past. The south face was later used as a billboard. The outer facade of the house consists of red brick, but the front (Greenwich) and rear (Trinity) faces have been painted gray. A one-story \\"commercial addition\\" was constructed in 1922 on the Trinity Place side of the building. This addition was most recently used as a tavern. As of 2011, the Dickey House is one of only seven surviving pre-1810 houses located south of Chambers Street. The building, however, has been in disrepair since the turn of the 21st century. Currently, the house is hollowed out, with its roof and chimney removed to facilitate construction of 77 Greenwich (see below), after which the building will be restored in the original style. As a result, only three outer faces (Greenwich, Edgar, Trinity) currently make up the building, while the construction and restoration are ongoing. Numerous historical landmarks are located in the vicinity of the house. To the west and north at Greenwich and Rector Streets is 88 Greenwich Street. One block north of the site on Trinity Place are the Trinity Church and the American Stock Exchange Building. To the immediate southwest across the Battery Tunnel approaches is 21 West Street. =Rehabilitation= As part of the construction of 77 Greenwich Street, the Dickey House will be renovated and converted for use as a public elementary school building. The school will occupy both the house and portions of the lower floors of the tower. The exterior will be restored to its 19th-century condition. The 1922-built retail addition, considered non-historical, will be removed to create a new entrance to the building. Part of the new tower will cantilever over the house. The project was designed by FXFOWLE. The house will be renovated by the New York City School Construction Authority. =Transportation= The Dickey House is directly served by several New York City Subway stops. The Rector Street station of the IRT Broadway‚ÄìSeventh Avenue Line () is located under Greenwich Street, and a station of the same name is located on the BMT Broadway Line () under Trinity Place. The Wall Street and Bowling Green stations of the IRT Lexington Avenue Line () are located under Broadway east of the site. The local bus serves the site on Trinity Place (northbound) and Broadway (southbound). Numerous express bus routes to/from outer boroughs also operate in the area. The Staten Island Ferry Whitehall Terminal is located south of the site, connected by the subway or bus. History Robert Dickey and Anne Dickey (n√©e Brown) were both born in what is now Northern Ireland, and later emigrated to the United States. Robert Dickey arrived in the U.S. in 1798. The two married in Baltimore, Maryland in 1807. Robert Dickey was a spice merchant, whose fortunes put him among the wealthiest men in New York City at the time. The lower ends of Greenwich Street and Trinity Place were created circa 1790, when a \\"bluff\\" created by the Hudson River tides was leveled and filled in order to be developed. In 1809, Robert Dickey purchased three lots at the south end of Greenwich Street. Two of the lots were originally owned by Comfort Sands and given to his daughters in 1796. One of his daughters was the wife of New York banker and broker Nathaniel Prime. Dickey proceeded to construct two houses on the site, addressed 69 and 71 Greenwich Street (later 65 and 67). Stables and a storehouse fronting Trinity Place (then called Lumber Street) were also built on adjacent lots. At the time Greenwich Street was known as \\"Millionaire's Row\\" and later called the \\"Original Park Avenue\\", and the two houses were among numerous other Federal-style rowhouses on the street. Dickey acquired the adjacent 73 Greenwich Street (future 69 Greenwich) in 1816, while selling 69 Greenwich. He operated his business ventures from the rear of the property on Lumber Street. In 1821, Dickey sold the two remaining houses. In 1822, the New York City Common Council established the modern building addresses on Greenwich Street; 71 Greenwich Street was renamed 67 Greenwich Street. Ninth Avenue (left) and Sixth Avenue (right) elevated lines merging near the Dickey House circa 1893 The house was transferred to Peter Schermerhorn (brother of Abraham Schermerhorn) in 1823, and the Schermerhorn family owned the building through the 19th century. During this time, the house was rented out to prominent New Yorkers. These included William Bayard Jr., Nicholas Low, and Ezra Ludlow (father of William H. Ludlow). It also served as the French Consulate building from 1830 to 1831. By the 1840s, it became a boarding house. In the late 1860s, construction began on the Ninth Avenue Elevated railroad along Greenwich Street in front of the house. The elevated line opened in 1868. Shortly afterwards, the Sixth Avenue Line was erected along Trinity Place (then called New Church Street), with the two lines merging at Morris Street. This meant that both the front and rear faces of the Dickey House were obstructed by elevated tracks. In April 1871, the house was among several in Lower Manhattan raided by police under the suspicion of prostitution. In 1872, Detlef Lienau was contracted to remodel the house, removing the hipped roof and adding the building's fourth floor. By this time, the building was used as a tenement, with the original upper class residents of the neighborhood having relocated uptown and immigrants taking their place. An 1890 police census reported 57 tenants of Irish descent occupying the house. The house was sold in 1919 to Rose A. McGuigan. One year later, McGuigan (also spelled \\"McGuigman\\") filed plans to convert the house and the adjacent 65 Greenwich Street property into a six-story office building. Around this time, the surrounding neighborhood west of Greenwich Street developed into an Arab immigrant community known as Little Syria. In 1922, the one-story shop extension was constructed on Trinity Place. left The Sixth and Ninth Avenue elevated lines were closed in 1938 and 1940 respectively, and dismantled in the 1940s. During the construction of the Brooklyn‚ÄìBattery Tunnel in that decade, numerous buildings in the neighborhood were demolished. This included many on Greenwich Street, and most of Little Syria. The Dickey House, however, remained, with Edgar Street moved north to the south face of the house. Because of this, the house would later be described as a \\"Robert Moses survivor\\". In 1960, the Dickey House was purchased by brothers-in-law Irving Schachter and Eli Goldhagen. At this time, the building was used by a paper company. The house was first nominated for possible landmark status in 1967. On February 11, 1991, the New York State Historic Preservation Office identified the building as a potential state or national landmark. By the turn of the 21st century, the house was in a state of disrepair. Following the September 11 attacks, the building was vacated. On June 28, 2005, the house was designated as a city landmark by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission. The designation was opposed by Martha Schachter Schessel and Harry Schessel, who were the owners of the house and the descendants of Irving Schachter. They wanted the building to be demolished. The family claimed restoration costs would run to $6 million. =Redevelopment= In 2008, it was revealed that the Syms Corporation, who owned and operated a store in the adjacent building (42 Trinity Place), planned to develop a multi-story tower on the shop site. To do this, they would need to purchase air rights from adjacent buildings including the Dickey House. In May 2008, Syms purchased the Dickey House. In November 2011, Syms filed for bankruptcy and closed all of its locations in January 2012. Beginning in late 2014, Syms (now reorganized as Trinity Place Holdings) planned to construct a residential and retail tower on the former store. By 2016, the project was named 77 Greenwich Street. The plan would incorporate the Dickey House into the development, renovating the house for use as an elementary school. Demolition of the Syms building was complete in October 2017. At this time, the chimney and north face of 67 Greenwich were removed, and metal support beams were installed to maintain the house's structural integrity.

Description Prasophyllum catenemum is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single shiny, pale green, tube-shaped leaf, long and wide with a reddish-purple base. Between six and twenty flowers are crowded along a flowering spike long. The flowers are lemon scented, white and green to purplish and wide. As with others in the genus, the flowers are inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The dorsal sepal is lance-shaped to egg-shaped, long and wide with dark lines. The lateral sepals are long, wide, free from, or partly joined to each other. The petals are linear in shape, green to purplish, long and wide. The labellum is white, broadly lance-shaped to egg-shaped, long, wide and turns sharply upwards at about 90¬∞ near its middle. The upturned part of the labellum is crinkled and there is a yellowish-green callus in the centre of the labellum. Flowering occurs in September and October. Taxonomy and naming Prasophyllum catenemum was first formally described in 2006 by David Jones from a specimen collected near Streaky Bay and the description was published in Australian Orchid Research.

In 2017 it was estimated to be worth ¬£40 million to the economy of Sussex with 60 brewers employing 375 workers. History=Medieval period= In the late medieval period, ale was known to have been brewed by monks at Lewes Priory as the water was too contaminated to drink. The Normans introduced cider to Sussex in the 11th century. Nevertheless in the late 14th and early 15th centuries it is recorded that even in regions with a cider drinking history such as Sussex, ale was a more popular drink than cider. Parts of the Rose & Crown public house at Fletching date from around 1150 From the late 14th century hopped beer was being imported into Winchelsea. The first recorded hopped beer in Sussex and one of the first in England arrived at Winchelsea from the Low Countries in 1400. At this time ale produced in the countryside was typically weak and flat and quickly deteriorated. Adding hops instead of spices produced a drink that would last longer and which was favoured by some drinkers. It is recorded that in 1426-27 beer was being bought for Sir Thomas Etchingham and workers that he employed. Hops were being imported into Sussex and since no manufactured beer was being imported, beer must have been manufactured locally in Sussex, usually by foreign residents. In 1460 hopped beer was being bought in Rye. By the 1490s records from the leet and rape courts show hopped beer was being sold at Brede (at the time near the coast), Alfriston (on the South Downs) and at Laughton and Waldron in the Weald. By 1500 \\"beer was being sold almost everywhere\\" in the county. This was due to Sussex's ties with the Low Countries; in many English villages outside Sussex no hopped beer was sold well into the 16th century and later. Henry Stanton was accused in Crawley in 1602 of stealing nutmeg and cinnamon, the spices are likely to have been to flavour hopped beer rather than unhopped ale. Sussex's oldest public houses date from the medieval period including the Rose & Crown at Fletching (c 1150, mostly rebuilt 17th century), the Mermaid Inn at Rye (1156, rebuilt 1420), the George & Dragon at Houghton (1276), the George at Alfriston (first licensed 1397), the Blackboys Inn at Blackboys in the parish of Framfield (14th century), the Spread Eagle, Midhurst (c1435), the Star (originally the Star of Bethlehem, Alfriston, c. 1450). =Tudor period (1485-1603)= In 1524 a licence was granted for Edward Guildford to export hops from Rye and Winchelsea. The earliest oast houses date from 1585 in Rye and Salehurst in 1597. Many Sussex brewers at this time were from the Low Countries. Cornelis Roetmans from Flanders was a brewer in Playden until his death in 1530. Dirick Carver, also from Flanders, was a brewer at the Black Lion in Brighton. Carver was burnt at the stake at Lewes during the reign of Mary I in 1555. There is a legend of the Brede Giant, who devoured a child every night for supper. According to the story, local children made a vat of beer for the giant to drink. Whilst in a drunken state the giant was sawn in two at Groaning Bridge by some children from the east of the county on one side of the saw and some from the west on the other side. The story is said to have been based on Goddard Oxenbridge, a Catholic former sheriff of Sussex, perhaps at a time when many people were suspicious of Catholics. Local smugglers may have encouraged the stories to keep people away from Oxenbridge's landholdings so that they could be used for contraband. =Stuart era (1603-1700)= From the 1620s and 1630s, Sabbatarianism gained ground across parts of Sussex. During Cromwell's interregnum, Rye stood out as a Puritan 'Common Wealth', a centre of social experiment and rigorous public morality. The people of Rye seem in general to have ignored the strict sabbatarianism enforced by the constables, particularly where 'immoderate drinking' was concerned. =18th century= One notable brew from the 18th century is a strong beer from Newhaven brewer Thomas Tipper known as Old Stingo which English king George IV was known to enjoy. Old Stingo is also mentioned in Charles Dickens' Martin Chuzzlewit in which Mrs Gamp is known to partake in the celebrated staggering ale of Brighton Stingo. Harveys Brewery was founded in 1790 in Lewes and is the oldest brewery in Sussex. The beer cocktail named huckle-my-buff that was created in Sussex and is sometimes considered to have been the world's first cocktail. Huckle-my-buff is a hot drink consisting of brandy, eggs, beer, sugar and nutmeg. It was originally made with smuggled French brandy and Harveys porter beer. =19th century= Using the slogan 'beef, beer and bacca', the Skeleton Army riots against the temperance message of Salvation Army across the county resulted in disturbances at several places and the Riot Act having to be read at Worthing. By the late 19th century people in Sussex each drank an average amount of of beer per year. Various customs and drinking songs in Sussex were associated with the drinking of beer. During harvest time there was a custom that each of around 20-30 men at a table would drink a glass of beer placed on top of a tall hat and when finished had to catch the glass inside the hat. They would then need to repeat the exercise with more drinks until completing the task while the group sung Turn The Cup Over, a song which begins \\"I've been to London, I've been to Dover...\\". Belloc himself writing two drinking songs relating to the drinking of beer in Sussex: the Sussex Drinking Song and the West Sussex Drinking Song, which was included in Belloc's novel, The Four Men: a Farrago. Sung at the annual dinner of the now-defunct Men of Sussex Society, The Song o' the Sussex Men, written in Sussex dialect by Arthur Beckett, celebrates Tom Tipper a brewer from Newhaven alongside other important characters associated with Sussex including St Wilfrid, St Cuthman, St Dunstan, John Dudeney, Tom Paine, Percy Bysshe Shelley, Richard Cobden and the Devil. =20th century= Published in 1911, The Four Men: a Farrago is Hilaire Belloc's novel in which the four characters walk 90 miles across Sussex visiting several pubs and celebrating Sussex beer. Belloc's characters largely live on a diet of cheese, bacon and Sussex beer and Belloc refers to their 'baptism by beer'. The Arundel Brewery was founded in 1992 and the Dark Star Brewery founded at the Evening Star pub in Brighton in 1994. =21st century= The King and Barnes brewery at Horsham was taken over in 2000 by Dorset-based Hall and Woodhouse who closed and demolished the brewery building. After the closure head brewer Andy Hepworth was determined to keep the maintain the tradition of brewing in this part of Sussex by starting his own brewery, Hepworth in 2001. The take-over and closure of King and Barnes left a gap in the Sussex market which was a factor in the expansion of the Dark Star brewery. The 2002 change to beer taxation implemented by Gordon Brown, known as Progressive Beer Duty, halved the amount of duty for small brewers and helped Sussex's small brewers to expand. In February 2001, Ray Welton moved his brewery (Weltons Brewery) into Horsham. Ray had been brewing since 1995 and was taught commercial brewing by Fred Martin the retired head brewer of King & Barnes. Fred handed on the Old Ale recipe which Weltons have been brewing since 2001 and continue to brew to this day. In December 2006 Harvey's popular best bitter Harveys Best was removed from sale from the Lewes Arms in Lewes; a 133-day boycott of the Lewes Arms by the people of Lewes ensued until Harveys Best was reinstated. A rebranding in 2016 saw Harveys include the strapline We wunt be druv, the unofficial motto of the county of Sussex. This comes as part of a planned expansion beyond its traditional reach of miles from its brewery at Lewes. Sussex's first micropub, Anchored in Worthing, opened in 2013 in Worthing Craft beer grown in Sussex. Notable breweries include Harveys of Lewes, Dark Star, Burning Sky, Weltons, Hepworth, Laine Brew Co, Bartleby's, Brighton Bier, Two Tribes, Arundel Brewery. Burning Sky was set up in 2013 by Mark Tranter, formerly of Dark Star where he was head brewer. Styles A range of diverse styles of beer is produced in Sussex. Historically well-hopped, Sussex beers were traditionally slightly sweeter than beers from neighbouring Kent. =Bitter= Nutty and bitter, Harveys's Sussex Best Bitter has won the 2005 and 2006 awards for the champion best bitter at the CAMRA beer festival and has been called one of the best traditional British beers. Hepworth's Sussex Pale Bitter has been described as one of England's best organic beers. =Old ale= Several Sussex breweries produce a weaker style of old ale with some resemblance to a mild ale.The boundary between old ale and mild is blurry, simply because, historically, old ale was mild ale, but aged. Examples include King and Barnes (later W. J King) (4.5% ABV), Weltons Beers (4.5% ABV) (primed with molasses) and Harveys (4.3% ABV) These are typically consumed on draught dispense. Hepworth encourages consumers to 'gently mull' its dark Classic Old Ale which it describes as a \\"traditional style of winter beer\\" =Sour beers= Monolith from Burning Sky has been described as one of the UK's best sour beers. Ingredients=Hops= Oast house for drying hops at Great Dixter, Northiam The dried flowers of hop plants are used to give beer its distinctive taste. Hops have been grown in Sussex since the 16th century. Hops continue to be grown in Sussex, mostly in the north-east of the county to the north of Hastings. Bramling Cros hops and challenger hops are grown in Sussex. A type of wild hop discovered in a hedgerow at Northiam in 2005 is now called the Sussex Hop which has earthy, grassy minty aromas. =Malt= Malt was historically produced from barley often grown in Sussex especially on the South Downs. Brewing malt is currently produced at Goodwood. =Water= Various Sussex breweries use their own springs to produce beer including Harveys of Lewes and Gun Brewery of Gun Hill.

It was the second bread museum in the world and the first of USSR. It was destroyed in 1992 during the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. History Idea of establishment of bread museum belongs to first Secretary of the district party committee, Sadykh Murtuzayev. The repair and restoration works of the mill that started in 1982 were completed in 1983. The museum was first visited on November 25, 1983. The Armenian Armed Forces attacked the museum twice. Although the first projectile hit the third exhibition hall, it did not explode. The second missile was targeted on August 12, 1992 at 16:40. Zahid Valiyev, the chief investigator on the Karabakh Inter-district Prosecutor's Office, said in the materials of the criminal case No. 64525 that on August 12, 1992, a powerful missile and ball was fired by the Khanabad and Nakhchivanik villages of the former Askeran region of Aghdam, and one of the missiles fell onto the Bread Museum. It was the missile that abolished existence of the museum. It was not possible to extinguish the fire. As a result, about 1500 exhibits in the museum were burned down.

It was protected by the state as a monument to local culture. The designs carried out by the museum are carried out by a team led by Eduard Krupkin, an employee of the Artistic Design Department of the Ministry of Culture. The delegation was headed by Sariya Ismayilova, chief of the museum department. The museum consisted of three main sections. The entrance was opened directly to the summer hall. There was a small fountain in the middle of the partly covered hall. It was also possible to move to the \\"Sunbul\\" caf√©, both to the kitchen and to two small dining rooms. Exhibition hall was located entering the hall and turning left. There was also the second entrance of the museum, which led to the administration office. As the exhibition hall was tall, some of it was divided into the upper floors. There was a 20 square meter administrative room with a foyer on the left side of the entrance door. There was an entrance to the museum's backyard from the top of that place. At the museum, additional exhibits of the museum were kept. The ceramic boards inside the museum were made to fit the atmosphere of the mill. 80 thousand rubles were spent for the design works inside the museum. Exhibits The first exhibition hall area was , the second was . In the first hall there was a mechanical mill with a capacity of grinding 8-10 tons of wheat per day. Here is also the \\"Trier\\" grain cleaner, which was used in the 30s of the last century. In the second exhibition hall there were demonstrations of instruments - wings, legs, china, wagons, handmade mill (kirkira) from II century, and a grain grinder called \\"charchar\\". The wooden staircase on the right side of the mall was used to climb to the second floor. Products made from flour, including baked breads in Ganja, Nakhchivan, Garabagh, Georgia, Armenia, Dagestan and Samarkand were exhibited here. In addition, old pot and kitchen utensils were exhibited in the lower hall. The next hall was dedicated exclusively to grain-growing and farming issues. There were various types of grain, wheat, bread cards given to children during the war, as well as Azerbaijan's map made of wheat. A milling staff was also set up in the staff table of the museum. The goal was to keep the mill in good working order so as to deliver ready-made products to guests. The oldest museum exhibits were wheat grains of VII millennium BC. Although the wheat was presented to the museum by academician Imam Mustafayev, the grains were discovered by the well-known archaeologist, corresponding member of the Azerbaijan National Academy of Sciences, Professor Ideal Narimanov during the excavations conducted on the Chalaghan hill in the Afatli village of Aghdam. Later on, only hardened wheat grains were rescued and transferred to the Azerbaijan History Museum by Chimnaz Aliyeva, who worked as head of the cultural department.

Emigration to England Since she was considered a \\"non- aryan\\" under the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service, a law passed by the National Socialist regime on 7 April 1933, two months after Adolf Hitler attained power. Under this law the Hamburg Senate withdrew her teaching licence in July 1933. She then taught at a Jewish home economics school and at the Israelite Hospital. In 1936 she visited England to see her brother Theo Plaut, living in Hull, and explored the possibility of sending her children to school there. In December 1938, the couple moved to England to escape persecution. Due to lack of recognition of her professional qualifications she could not practice in the UK at that time.

It was hosted by Bob Davidse and Terry Van Ginderen, who both presented themselves to their young viewers as Nonkel Bob (Uncle Bob) and Tante Terry (Aunt Terry).ADRIAENS, Manu, Blijven kijken! 50 jaar televisie in Vlaanderen, Uitgeverij Lannoo, Tielt, 2003. It was the first Flemish children's TV show. Since there was only one Flemish TV channel at the time virtually all families with a TV set watched it.ADRIAENS, Manu, Blijven kijken! 50 jaar televisie in Vlaanderen, Uitgeverij Lannoo, Tielt, 2003. It was also the show which launched the careers of Bob Davidse and Terry Van Ginderen. History TV maker Rik Van den Abbeele had contacted Bob Davidse, who was already well known in Flanders as a singer and puppeteer.http://www.tv-visie.be/nieuws/belgie/17februari2010/vrt-treurt-om- het-overlijden-van-bob-davidse_35533/ The first episode was broadcast on 12 March 1955. Bob Davidse, nicknamed Nonkel Bob, was first co-hosted by Tante Paula (Aunt Paula, played by TV presenter Paula S√©mer. She was later succeeded by Tante Lieve (Lieve Simoens), Tante Rita, Tante Berta and Tante Ria (Mimi Peetermans). Eventually Terry van Ginderen became his permanent co-host as Tante Terry.http://www.tv-visie.be/nieuws/belgie/17februari2010/vrt-treurt-om- het-overlijden-van-bob-davidse_35533/ Concept Every episode started out with a song sung by Nonkel Bob, Tante Terry and all children in the studio, while Davidse played his guitar. The melody was based on the Sinterklaas song Oh kom eens kijken wat er in mijn schoentje ligt (Oh, come and look what's in my shoe), but had different lyrics, related to the show: Oh, kom eens kijken / ons uurtje zet nu in/ zo dadelijk zal blijken / iedereen krijgt hier zijn zin (Oh, come and see / our hour will start now / soon it will be proven / that everyone gets his wish). After the song everyone greeted the viewer with the TV Ohee-salute. By using two index fingers they created the letter t and afterwards the letter v with the aid of the index and middle finger (comparable to the V sign) and shouted: Ohee!. Nonkel Bob and Tante Terry then greeted the children in the studio and at home, whereupon everyone shouted Dag Nonkel Bob, Dag Tante Terry (Hi, Nonkel Bob, Hi Tante Terry!). During the broadcast hour Davidse had the children engage in handicraft or taught them a song on his guitar. The best known songs which debuted in this TV series were Vrolijke Vrienden (Happy Friends, 1958) and Annemarie (1968). Every week the show had an honorary guest, which was usually a child who was allowed to take part in the life of the adults, for instance the fire brigade. The hosts first interviewed him or her and then showed how the child's day was through an earlier recorded report at location.ADRIAENS, Manu, Blijven kijken! 50 jaar televisie in Vlaanderen, Uitgeverij Lannoo, Tielt, 2003.

Fanclub Davidse also had a fanclub, the TV-Oheeclub, which was established since every episode had a viewers' contest. Children who answered correctly received an award and after ten good answers they received a special sign, which made them part of the club. Through enthusiastic reactions and easy subscriptions (children just had to send a letter) the club soon had over 55.000 members.http://www.tv- visie.be/nieuws/belgie/17februari2010/vrt-treurt-om-het-overlijden-van-bob- davidse_35533/ADRIAENS, Manu, Blijven kijken! 50 jaar televisie in Vlaanderen, Uitgeverij Lannoo, Tielt, 2003.

The church was a gift to the people of Canna and Sanday from Gwendolyn Fitzalan-Howard, the 3rd Marchioness of Bute, who had it erected as a memorial to her father, Edward Fitzalan- Howard, 1st Baron Howard of Glossop, who had died in 1883. At the time, the islands were owned by the Thom family, though permission was willingly given by them, despite the fact that they were not Catholics, and would later build the Protestant St Columba's Church on Canna in 1912. Designed by William Frame, who was architect to the Butes, St Edward's was built between 1886 and 1890. The corbel course in the nave was supplied by Thomas Nicholls. Both of these men would later work on now-famous buildings in Cardiff, where the Marquess owned Cardiff Castle; the most prominent examples being the Pierhead Building, Castell Coch and the Animal Wall. At the time, the islands already had a Catholic chapel, dedicated to St Columba, which had been built on Canna in . After St Edward's was built, the old church was converted into a shop and post office. The populations of Sanday and Canna declined during the 20th Century, with their combined inhabitants now numbering around 30. In the face of this loss of parishioners, the church began to suffer from structural deterioration and closed in 1963. Services have now been moved back into the old St Columba's chapel on Canna (a replacement post office was built nearby). The former church received Listed status in 1985. After closure, the church was used as a hostelry, and in 2001, was converted into a Gaelic study centre at the cost of ¬£860,000. This was not a successful venture, as it was reported in 2010 that the centre had never been used, and was once again suffering from water damage. By 2016, it was once again disused.

One of the large oratorio choirs in the city, they perform regularly at the Tonhalle and internationally, often with the Tonhalle-Orchester Z√ºrich, and traditionally with notable soloists such as Ilona Durigo, Karl Erb and Ernst H√§fliger. Premieres have included works by Johannes Brahms and contemporary composers.  History  The first concert of Der Gemischte Chor was in Haydn's Die Sch√∂pfung in December 1863. A year later, concerts on Good Friday became a tradition. The choir performed from the beginning Passions by Bach and others, oratorios and Requiem settings. In fall concerts, contemporary music was in focus. Johannes Brahms rehearsed and conducted several of his works with the choir, including Ein deutsches Requiem in 1869 and the premiere of N√§nie in 1881. Other guest conductors included Max Bruch, Camille Saint-Sa√´ns and Richard Strauss. Carl Schuricht conducted performances of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony as part of the Festwochen on 2 July 1957. The choir was, together with others, instrumental in founding the first Tonhalle, its first permanent orchestra in 1868, and the building of an organ in 1872. It has performed internationally, singing for example in 1911 the Italian premiere of Bach's St Matthew Passion at La Scala in Milan. In 1984, the choir performed Heinrich Suter's Le laudi di San Francesco d‚ÄôAssisi at the Alte Oper in Frankfurt, and in 1985 Handel's Jephtha in Prague. Works by Swiss composers also included Willy Burkhard's Das Gesicht Jesajas, Honegger's Le Roi David and J√ºngst und einst by Paul Suits. The choir performed premieres of commissioned works, in October 2006 Au-del√† du regard by after poems by the Lebanese writer Nadia Tu√©ni, and for the 150th anniversary in 2013, D‚Äôun pays lointain by Edward Rushton. In 2017, the choir performed Frank Martin's Golgotha.  Conductors  Friedrich Hegar The first regular conductor was the composer Friedrich Hegar, who directed the choir until 1901, and was also the first conductor of the Tonhalle-Orchester from 1868 to 1906. He was succeeded by Hermann Suter, Volkmar Andreae, Erich Schmid, R√§to Tschupp, and from 1996, . Krause has focused on Bach, French composers and music of the 20th and 21st centuries. In the fall concerts, he introduced lesser known music by contemporary composers, including commissioned new works.  Soloists  From the beginning, the choir performed with international soloists. The German heldentenor Heinrich Vogl was a soloist in 9 concerts between 1872 and 1885. The contralto Ilona Durigo from Budapest was a soloist in more than 40 concerts between 1911 and 1943. The German tenor Karl Erb performed from 1920 to 1938 in 12 concerts, especially as the Evangelist in Bach's Passions. The bass performed from 1922 and 1937 in 16 concerts, including Bach's St Matthew Passion in 1929, and Paul Hindemith's Das Unaufh√∂rliche in 1932, a year after the premiere. The tenor Ernst H√§fliger made his debut as the Evangelist in Bach's St John Passion in the Good Friday concerts of 1943 and sang regularly, in 38 concerts until 1984. Soloists in the 20th century have also included sopranos Ursula Buckel, Lisa della Casa, Edith Mathis, Elisabeth Speiser and Maria Stader, contralto Elsa Cavelti, tenor and Kurt Huber, and basses Heinz Rehfuss and Jakob St√§mpfli.  Archive  The Zentralbibliothek Z√ºrich has held from 1980 the archive of the choir, including manuscripts, letters, protocols, invoices, contracts, membership lists, concert programs and music.

Harold Dewolf, was an American Methodist minister and professor of systematic theology at Boston University where he was Martin Luther King Jr.'s \\"primary teacher and mentor\\".  Early life and education  DeWolf was born on 31 January 1905 in Columbus, Nebraska. He obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree from Nebraska Wesleyan University in 1924, then pursued theological studies at Boston University where, in 1926, he obtained a Bachelor of Sacred Theology degree. He received the Borden Parker Bowne Fellowship in Philosophy at Boston University in 1933‚Äì1934, and received his Doctor of Philosophy degree in philosophy in 1935 studying under Edgar S. Brightman. His dissertation was titled Premises of the Arguments Concerning Immortality in Thirty Ingersoll Lectures (1896‚Äì1934).  Academic career  After graduating, DeWolf served, from 1926 to 1936, as a minister of the Methodist Episcopal Church in Nebraska and Massachusetts. He taught in the philosophy department at Boston University from 1934 to 1944, when he joined the faculty of Boston University School of Theology as professor of systematic theology. He also taught twice in Central and East Africa, in 1955‚Äì1956 and 1962‚Äì1963. From 1965, until his retirement in 1972, DeWolf was Dean of Wesley Theological Seminary in Washington, DC. In the 1970s he moved to Lakeland, Florida, where he gave periodical lectures at Florida Southern College. He died on 24 March 1986.  Martin Luther King Jr.  DeWolf became Martin Luther King Jr.'s dissertation adviser at Boston University following the death of Brightman. In his 1955 reader's report, DeWolf concluded that King's work promised to be \\"an excellent and useful scholarly achievement.\\" In a 1955 letter to his former adviser King wrote: \\"Both your stimulating lectures and your profound ideas will remain with me so long as the cords of memory shall lengthen. I have discovered that both theologically and philosophically much of my thinking is DeWolfian\\". In a 1956 letter to King during the Montgomery bus boycott, DeWolf wrote, \\"Your letter is a renewing inspiration to me as has been the marvelous leadership which you have given to our people in the south land during these last months.\\" He concluded his letter by saying, \\"may He bring to you victory for all the people, for which you are making such great sacrifices.\\" King remained friends with DeWolf throughout his life and DeWolf supported King's efforts in the civil rights movement. King invited DeWolf to help with his desegregation campaign in St. Augustine, Florida, and, with three colleagues from Boston University, DeWolf was part of the tense civil rights discussions there. DeWolf spoke at King's funeral on 9 April 1968, calling him \\"an exemplar of faith, hope, and love.\\" DeWolf later testified before the United States Congress as part of the efforts to have a national holiday honoring King established.

Deciding that everyday life in Moscow did not live up to his expectations, Lusya decides to leave the show and return home to his mother. His colleagues from the show arrange a farewell concert, and in the morning, all five of them as their female alter-egos, put Lusya on the train, arranging an impromptu show at the station. Arriving in his native village, Lusya understands that there is nothing left from his former life. On his way home he meets an old woman neighbor who tells him the latest news and offers him to stay at her place if he needs to. Suspecting something wrong, Lusya enters the house and sees his inebriated mother in the company of drinking companions. In the evening, Lusya meets a girl who was romantically interested in him but with whom their relationship did not work out. The girl, having learned that Lusya became an artist in Moscow, rushes at him with kisses. Lusya realizes that he must make a coming-out; in a pink suit, Lusya arranges a mini-performance, the audience of which are local village old women and geese.

This affair ends with the death of Rosa at the hands of this new acquaintance; for him the murder of Rosa becomes a kind of revenge for all homosexual humanity as in his early childhood he was raped by a pedophile maniac and since then he has had anger and desire to destroy homosexuals. Gelya A young boy, whose mother is a well-known Moscow dressmaker who makes costumes for the city's elite. Mother does not know about the passion of her son to wear women's dresses, to wear makeup and copy women's manners.

Entering the supermarket, the cheerful four arrange another extravagant show. Lara The most unusual drag queen of all who wears a women's costume only on the stage and nowhere else. His story began with during the student years when Lara had to play the role of a gypsy woman at a Komsomol concert and was dressed this way by the organizers. The leadership, who watched the ensemble's rehearsal, was indignant at the performance, especially with the choice of music and Lara was even reprimanded for it. However this meeting ended in an unexpected way, the talk continued in the apartment of the leader, who suddenly appeared in a female guise. But the encounter ended in a heart attack, and as a result the Komsomol leader's career broke down because the ambulance took him away in a woman's dress.

It took ten years for the project to be realized because LGBT related films are rarely produced in Russia. When working on his role, Danila Kozlovsky observed a strict diet and carefully studied documentary recordings of drag shows and rehearsals with the director of the picture. When the entire film was almost finished but it seemed that there was still something missing, Alyona Babenko was hired for the role of a journalist who interviews the performers. Renata Litvinova gave some advice concerning the screenplay to the director.

She is particularly remembered for her interest in spiritualism and theosophy and her association with Helena Blavatsky, whose occult successor she claimed to be. She was born in London, the daughter of a Spanish nobleman, Don Jos√© de Mariategui, and his English wife, who was descended from the Earl of Northampton. Her first husband was General le Comte de Medina Pomar, by whom she had one son, Emmanuel. On his death in 1868, she inherited a considerable fortune.

This page lists these crashes and sharp falls in the two primary Indian stock markets, namely the BSE and NSE. Financial Times terms a double- digit percentage fall in the stock markets over five minutes as a crash, while Jayadev et al. describe a stock market crash in India as a \\"fall in the NIFTY of more than 10% within a span of 20 days\\" or \\"difference of more than 10% between the high on a day and the low on the next trading day\\" or \\"decline in the NIFTY of more than 9% within a span of 5 days\\". As per the latter definition, the Nifty experienced 15 crashes during the period 2000 to 2008 with a number of them having occurred in the months of January, May and June 2008. The crash of 1865 As per the Business Standard, India experienced its first stock market crash in 1865. Although the Bombay stock exchange had not yet been formed, Gujrati and Parsi traders often traded shares mutually at the junction of Rampart row and Meadows street. In the preceding years, speculation about the results of the American civil war had led to irrational increases of stocks of new Indian companies. Shares of the Back bay reclamation (face value Rs. 5,000) touched Rs. 50,000 and those of Bank of Bombay (face value Rs.500) touched Rs. 2,850. Money made from cotton was pumped into the stock market driving prices of stocks higher. Banks loaned money to speculators further fuelling the bull run and wealthy merchants like Premchand Roychand dispensed advice that led to ordinary people placing their bets on shares. On 16 November 1864, the governor warned civil servants not to participate in the current frenzy. New companies were floated with new share issues publicized in the newspapers. Forward contracts further promoted speculative purchases. However, the market crashed in May 1865 when the civil war ended, causing cotton prices to fall. Shares of the Backbay reclamation fell by 96% to under Rs. 2,000 and a number of merchants including Behramji Hormuzjee Cama went bankrupt. The crash not only led to a dwindling of the financial fortunes of many, it also led to a decrease of the city's population by 21% due to the closing down of many enterprises. On 1 July 1865, when hundreds of \\"time bargains\\" had matured (as the future contracts were then known), buyers and sellers alike defaulted leading to the burst of the bubble. A share of Bank of Bombay which had touched Rs 2,850 at the peak of the market slumped to just Rs 87 in the aftermath of the bust. Crash of 1991 After economic liberalisation in India in 1991, the stock market saw a number of cycles of booms and busts, some related to scams such as those engineered by players such as Harshad Mehta and Ketan Parekh, some due to global events and a few due to circular trading, rigging of prices and the irrational exuberance of investors leading to bubbles that finally burst. Crash of 1992 On 28 April 1992, the BSE experienced a fall of 12.77% - its largest fall in history (in terms of percentage) due to the Harshad Mehta scam. Sonia Gandhi Election Crash of 2004 On 17 May 2004, the BSE fell 15.52% - its largest fall in history (in terms of percentage) due to the election win by Indian National Congress. Crash of 2006 On 18 May 2006, the BSE Sensex fell by 826 points to 11,391. Crashes of 2007 During the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008, the stock markets in India fell on several occasions in 2007 as well as 2008. In 2007, there were five sharp falls in the stock markets. * 2 April 2007: The sensex fell by 617 points to 12,455 though during the course of the day, it fell further. As per the analysts at rediff, \\"The Sensex opened with a huge negative gap of 260 points at 12,812 following the Reserve Bank of India [Get Quote] decision to hike the cash reserve ratio and repo rate. Unabated selling, mainly in auto and banking stocks, saw the index drift to lower levels as the day progressed. The index tumbled to a low of 12,426 before finally settling with a hefty loss of 617 points (4.7%) at 12,455\\". * 1 August 2007: The sensex continued to fall and finally settled at 14,936 while the nifty fell by 183 points to 4,346. As per Rediff, \\"The Sensex opened with a negative gap of 207 points at 15,344 amid weak trends in the global market and slipped deeper into the red. Unabated selling across-the-board saw the index tumble to a low of 14,911. The Sensex finally ended with a hefty loss of 615 points at 14,936. The NSE Nifty ended at 4,346, down 183 points.

The sensex tumbled all the way to a low of 17,771 - down 1,428 points from the same day's high. It finally settled on 17,998 with a loss of 717 points (3.8%). The Nifty too lost 208 points and closed at 5,351. * 21 November 2007: Trying to explain the fall, rediff recounted that \\"Mirroring weakness in other Asian markets, the Sensex saw relentless selling.\\" The index tumbled to a new low of 18,515 - down 766 points from the previous day's close. It finally ended with a loss of 678 points at 18,603. The Nifty also lost 220 points to close at 5,561. * 17 December 2007: As per rediff, \\"Again, a heavy bout of selling in the late noon deals saw the BSE Sensex plunge to a low of 19,177 - down 856 points from the day's open. The Sensex finally closed at 19,261 - a fall 0f 769 points (3.8%). The NSE Nifty 50 ended at 5,777, down 271 points\\". Crashes of 2008 * on 21 Jan 2008, the BSE fell by 1408 points to 17,605 leading to one of the largest erosions in investor wealth. The BSE stopped trading for a while at 2:30 pm due to a technical snag although its circuit filter allows swings of up to 15% before stopping trading for an hour. Referred to in the media as \\"Black Monday\\", the fall was blamed by analysts at HSBC mutual fund and JP Morgan on a large variety of reasons including change in the global investment climate, fears of United States' economy going into a recession, FIIs and foreign hedge funds selling in order to reallocate their funds from risky emerging markets to stable developed markets, a cut in US interest rates, global bourses (often referred to as event related volatility), volatility in commodities markets, a combination of global and local factors (\\"...other emerging markets were down nearly 20% so India is playing catch-up...\\"), huge build-ups in derivatives positions leading to margin calls and that many IPOs had sucked out liquidity from the primary market into the secondary market. HSBC mutual funds analysts predicted further falls in the stock market, and the analysts at JP Morgan were of the opinion that market would fall a further 10-15%. * On the next day on 22 January 2008, the Sensex again fell by 875 points to 16,729.Jan 22, 2008: The Sensex saw its biggest intra-day fall on Tuesday when it hit a low of 15,332, down 2,273 points. However, it recovered losses and closed at a loss of 875 points at 16,730. The Nifty closed at 4,899 at a loss of 310 points. Trading was suspended for one hour at the Bombay Stock Exchange after the benchmark Sensex crashed to a low of 15,576.30 within minutes of opening, crossing the circuit limit of 10 per cent. * On 11 Feb 2008, the Sensex fell by a further 834 points to 16,630. * On 3 March 2008, the Sensex fell by 900 points to settle at 16,677. * On 17 March 2008, the BSE Sensex fell further to 14,809 - a fall of 951 points. * On 24 October 2008, the BSE Sensex fell to 8701, a fall of 1070 points in a single day. * On 26 November 2008, the Sensex continue to fall, in the bargain (as per the financial newspaper Livemint) \\"...dashing middle class dreams\\". Analysts at Livemint and Ajmera associates, Anagram capital and Ace financial services ascribed a number of reasons for this, ranging from large sales by foreign institutional investors (FII), withdrawal of money by the insurance sector. They all felt that the Sensex could rise by at the most 20-30% in 2009, from its them level of 9000 points. Crash of 2009 On 6 July 2009, the Sensex fell by 869 points to 14,043. Crashes of year 2015  * On 6 Jan 2015, the Sensex fell by 854 points to 26,987. * On 24 August 2015, the BSE Sensex crashed by 1,624 points and the NSE fell by 490 points. Finally the indices closed at 25,741 points and the Nifty to 7,809 points. The reason given for this crash was given as a ripple effect due to fears over a slowdown in China, as the Yuan had been devalued two weeks ago leading to a fall in the currency rates of other currencies and the rapid selling of stocks in China and India. The Shanghai stock exchange too fell by 8.5%. A variety of other reasons too were given for this fall by analysts including disappointing earnings in the first quarter for many Indian companies, somber commentaries by their management leading to doubts regarding their recovery and a below average monsoon for that year. Crashes of 2016 The stock markets in India continued to fall in 2016. By 16 February 2016, the BSE had seen a fall of 26% over the past eleven months, losing 1607 points in four consecutive days of February. The reasons given for this included NPAs of Indian banks, \\"global weaknesses\\" and \\"global factors\\". In the four months from November 2015 to February 2016, FIIs were reported to have sold equities worth Rs 17,318 crore as, in the opinion of analysts, concerns grew over growth in China and as crude oil prices tumbled below $30 per barrel On 9 November 2016, crashed by 1689 points, believed by analysts to be due to the crack down on black money by the Indian government, resulting in franctic selling. The sensex nosedived by 6% to 26,902 and the Nifty dropped by 541 points to 8002. These were said to be due to the demonetization drive by the Modi government. The Hindu was of the opinion that the weakening rupee and the US presidential election too had some bearing on the behavior of investors. The fall was concurrent with falls in other Asian stock markets including the Hang Seng, Nikkei and the Shanghai Composite. The S&P; had also fallen by 4.45%. Crashes of 2018 * Although not classified as a crash, the BSE and NSE fell sharply on 2 and 5 February 2018, sparked by the comments of the Finance minister's proposal in the budget speech to introduce a 10% long term capital gains tax (LTCG) on equity shares sold after 12 months. The BSE Sensex fell by 600 points in two days, and the Nifty 50 fell by about 400 points to 10,676 on 5th. Earlier, the BSE Sensex had fallen by 570 points to 35,328 on 2 February and the NSE Nifty by 190 points to a low of 10,826. Crashes of 2020 On 1 February 2020, as the FY 2020-21 Union budget was presented in the lower house of the Indian parliament, Nifty fell by over 3% (373.95 points) while Sensex fell by more than 2% (987.96 points). The fall was also weighed by the global breakdown amid coronavirus pandemic centered in China. On 28 February 2020, Sensex lost 1448 points and Nifty fell by 432 points due to growing global tension caused by coronavirus, which W.H.O said has a pandemic potential. https://www.bbc.com/news/world-51665631 Both BSE and NSE fell for the entire five days of the week ending with the worst weekly fall since 2009 https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/market-live-indian-indices- pidilite-dic-india-rites-bob-hpcl-gtpl-hathway-4985151.html On March 4 and 6, markets fell by around 1000 points and several crores of wealth was wiped out. On 6 March 2020, Yes Bank was taken over by RBI under its management for reconstruction and will be merged with SBI. This was done to ensure smooth functioning of the bank as it was struggling for couple of years to cope up with heavy pressure due to cleaning of bad loans. On 9 March 2020, the Sensex fell by 1,941.67 points, while Nifty-50 broke down by 538 points. The fear of COVID-19 outbreak has created havoc all over the globe and India is no exception. Further, the recent Yes Bank crisis also made the markets fell. The markets ended in red with Sensex closing on 35,634.95 and Nifty-50 on 10,451.45. On 12 March 2020, the Sensex fell by 2919.26 points (-8.18% ), the worst continuation of the week in the history while Nifty-50 broke down by 868.25 points (-8.30% ) amid World Health Organisation (WHO) declaring Coronavirus outbreak as \\"pandemic\\". Sensex ended to 33-month low of 32778.14. On 16 March 2020, Sensex plunged by 2,713.41 points (around 8%), the second worst fall in its history. On the other hand, Nifty ended below 9200‚Äìmark at 9,197.40 due to global economic recession. However, the Sensex continued to fall straight for 4‚Äìcontinuous days till 19 March 2020, losing 5815 points during the period. On 23 March 2020, Sensex lost 3,934.72 points (13.15%) and Nifty plunges 1,135 points (12.98%) at 7610.25 as coronavirus-led lockdowns across the world triggered fears of a recession. These are now the lowest levels since 2016. It's witnessing the biggest weekly loss since October 2008, as the increasing number of coronavirus cases in India as well as globally.

The operation was a success with only one of the cadres out of a force of seventy-nine making it back to Zambia. Background The RLI continued to grow in strength during the latter part of 1966 and the beginning of 1967; it first began to experiment with parachutes early during this year, borrowing equipment from the SAS to do so. Walls was replaced as CO on 18 June 1967 by Lieutenant- Colonel Jack Caine, formerly of the British Coldstream Guards. Operation The next guerrilla incursion came on 1 August 1967, when a combined force of 79 ZIPRA and South African Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK) fighters crossed the Zambezi about east of Victoria Falls. Having mislaid 10 men along the way, they based up a week later in the Wankie Game Reserve, in the extreme west of the country, near the border with Botswana. The cadres, whose intention was to recruit local black Rhodesians and subsequently attack white farms and police stations, split into two groups. One headed towards Tjolotjo and the other made for Nkai. One of the members who had become lost earlier was captured by the RAR on the road between Victoria Falls and Wankie on 3 August, and from this captive the police and security forces learned of the two groups and of their intentions. Operation Nickel, described by Ron Reid-Daly as one of \\"the most significant operations of the war,\\" was launched. At first, the incursion was countered by the RAR, but after a tactical error in its third engagement with the guerrillas led to casualties, the Rhodesian African Rifles were joined by 2 commandos, RLI on 25 August 1967. The insurgents were consistently undone in their incursions by the suspicion of Rhodesia's rural blacks, whose tribal chiefs and headmen would often work together to inform the police and security forces of the infiltrators' presence. This proved to be no exception: when a cadre visited a local kraal early on 31 August to obtain food, an old woman invited him to stay and kept him there while she sent a young girl to alert the security forces. 7 troops and 2 commandos arrived at 07:20 and captured the insurgent, who then guided 7 troops, led by Lieutenant Charl Viljoen, and a platoon of RAR men to where his five comrades were encamped. The combined force surrounded the guerrillas and opened fire, killing four; the fifth escaped and returned to Zambia. The next day, on 1 September, 2 commando troops in ambush were informed by a tractor driver that he had been given money by 14 guerrillas the previous night to buy mielie-meal for them and that they would be collecting it from him at his kraal that evening. A sweep was planned; the tractor driver was briefed and returned to the kraal with the mielie-meal while 2 commandos and the RAR formed a cordon around it. The following morning the soldiers performed their sweep but failed to find the enemy, who were already gone. The insurgents, who were actually 17 in number and all South African Umkhonto fighters, crossed the border into Botswana and were arrested there on 3 September. Aftermath Of the 79 cadres who had crossed the border on 1 August, 29 were killed and 17 captured within Rhodesia, 29 were arrested in Botswana, where one also died, one was arrested in Durban and one escaped back to Zambia. One remained unaccounted for. Nickel was officially closed at 06:00 on 8 September 1967. Prime Minister Ian Smith attended the RLI's Annual Regimental Sundowner on 1 February 1968, commemorating the founding of the Battalion seven years earlier. Smith stood and proposed a toast to the Regiment and the health of \\"the incredible Rhodesian Light Infantry\\". The toast was widely publicized by the Rhodesian press and had such an impact that \\"The Incredibles\\" became a second nickname of the RLI alongside \\"The Saints\\". Captain F. Sutton, who had three years earlier composed the Battalion's slow march, The Rhodesian Light Infantry, renamed the march The Incredibles.

Despite the death or capture of 77 out of 79 men, ZAPU, from its base in the Zambian capital, Lusaka, did not regard the incursion as a failure; on the contrary, its leaders were pleased that they had inflicted some casualties on the Rhodesian African Rifles. Buoyed by what they perceived as a success, they planned another operation to take place in northern Mashonaland: about 100 men‚Äî75 ZIPRA and 25 MK‚Äîwere to infiltrate the Zambezi valley and establish a series of camps, including underground caches containing food, clothing, weapons and other equipment. They were instructed to avoid the Rhodesian Security Forces \\"at all cost\\" while they recruited local tribesmen to the nationalist cause and trained them. Once a sufficient indigenous force existed, they were to inform Lusaka, which would then coordinate a mass uprising. The aim was not to defeat the government forces, but rather to force the British military to intervene. If the operation were a success, the MK men were to be escorted to South Africa to begin similar activities. The operation The group, which consisted of 126 cadres, crossed the Zambezi around the turn of the year, with 34 cadres entering Rhodesia on 28 December 1967 and the remainder joining them on the nights of 3, 4 and 5 January 1968. The guerrillas busied themselves working their way into the country, setting up camps as they went, naming each \\"Camp One\\", \\"Camp Two\\" and so on. After two and a half months in Rhodesia the ZIPRA cadres had created five bases, each further south than the next in an almost straight line pointing due south; the fifth was about halfway between Karoi and the border and nearly due east from Makuti. They remained undetected until unfamiliar bootprints were discovered by David Scammel, a game ranger, on a well-worn path, about the width of a \\"four-lane highway\\", on 14 March 1968 around the midpoint between Camps Four and Five. On closer inspection Scammel found scraps of a sugar packet marked with Russian lettering. So began Operation Cauldron. 13 Troop, 3 Commando, under Lieutenant Sachse, made the first contact of Operation Cauldron on 18 March 1968 when they encountered the enemy in the alt=The viewer stands by a tree beside a stream. On the other side can be seen a wide, flat field and, in the distance, mountains. \\"The appropriately named Cauldron,\\" says Binda, \\"was to be the crucible in which the fighting character of the RLI was to be forged. ... It revealed to the world what outstanding and peerless anti-terrorist fighters the RLI were.\\" A Joint Operations Centre (JOC) was formed on 16 March 1968 at Karoi, made up of two RAR platoons, a BSAP patrol, and 1 and 3 Commandos, RLI. Two Vampire fighter-bombers and two Canberra bombers were detailed to circle the area and provide air strikes as needed; the mere presence of these aircraft demoralised many cadres into deserting before they even met the Rhodesian forces. A patrol of 13 troopers from 14 Troop, 3 Commando, led by Lieutenant Bert Sachse, made first contact with the enemy on the morning of 18 March, encountering 14 nationalists near the Angwa River in the Mana Pools area. Attacking an enemy on higher ground, Sachse's men killed 10 guerrillas but lost Trooper E. N. F. Ridge to sniper fire. He was first RLI soldier to be killed by enemy action. Nevertheless, the official operational report describes the contact as \\"a first-rate action in which Lieutenant Sachse's leadership and the determination of his men achieved an extremely successful result.\\" On the same day Lieutenant Chris Pearce's 13 Troop, 3 Commando, on patrol with a platoon of Rhodesian African Rifles under Lieutenant Ron Marillier, was fired upon on the bank of the Maura River in Northern Mashonaland by about 70 ZIPRA insurgents, encamped in a strong defensive position on the side of a hill feature. \\"We were going on up the bank and all hell broke loose,\\" recalled Pearce. \\"How we didn't take casualties I didn't quite know.\\" Pearce's 12 men were pinned down by heavy machine-gun fire and outnumbered by around six to one. Lance-Corporal Dennis Croukamp \\"on his own initiative and with complete disregard for his own safety\\" in the words of the official report, twice crawled forward to throw grenades at the enemy position to allow the troop to redeploy into better cover. Pearce unsuccessfully attempted to assault the enemy position, then gave covering fire to an abortive flank attack by Marillier's RAR men. The security forces then attempted one final assault just before nightfall, but this also failed due to the superior numbers of ZIPRA fighters. The cadres dispersed and evacuated the area during the night and were gone when a Rhodesian sweep took place the next morning. A series of contacts over the following days resulted in the guerrilla squads being split up and severely weakened, with the men who did not surrender or desert being killed or arrested; on 21 March, the insurgent commanders in Lusaka realised that their men had been detected and ordered the only remaining intact team, made up of 26 men, to return to Zambia. An assault on an enemy camp near Sipolilo on 26 March by 21 men from RLI Training Troop resulted in the deaths of two Troopers, R. A. Binks and G. D. Wessels. By 27 March, 28 cadres had been killed and 15 captured; by 3 April, the figures stood at 36 dead and 24 in custody. Five more were arrested on 4 April and one shot dead by men from 1 Troop, 1 Commando, south of Makuti. \\"It now appeared obvious,\\" says Binda, \\"that the insurgents had scattered and were on the run.\\" On 9 April, the last contact with any significant number of guerrillas involved took place north of Karoi. A police unit and 4 Troop, 1 Commando encountered a group of insurgents and killed all seven, but lost Trooper M. E. Thornley to a fatal chest wound. Aftermath When Operation Cauldron was closed on 31 May 1968, 58 of the 126 fighters who had crossed from Zambia had been confirmed killed and 51 had been captured. Of the 17 outstanding, nine had returned to Zambia, leaving eight unaccounted for. Having acquitted themselves well during the operation, the young RLI troopers, many still teenagers, earned high praise from Platoon Warrant Officer Herod of the RAR, who had been wounded fighting alongside them on the Maura on 18 March 1968. \\"We of the RAR used to laugh at your soldiers,\\" Herod said to RLI Sergeant Tim Baker, who was visiting him in hospital. \\"To us they looked like boys. But they showed us how to fight. They have the faces of boys, but they fight like lions.\\" NotesReferences=Biography= Battles and operations of the Rhodesian Bush War ","title":"Operation Cauldron (Rhodesia)"},{"id":"56458241","text":"The Bolen Building, located at 85 W.

It belongs to French Ministry of Culture and is organized in 2 departments. Institut national du patrimoine is located in 2 historical sites : galerie Colbert, in the heart of Institut national d'histoire de l'art (INHA) for the department of curators and administrative headquarters, and Aubervilliers, for the department of conservators, re-using a former matchstick factory dating from the 19th century and totally renovated for the purposes of the initial and continuing training programmes.  History  Institut national du patrimoine (Inp) is one of the most recent French leading schools (\\"grandes √©coles\\") the name of which was given in 2001. The aim of this institution was to gather two previous public institutions : Institut fran√ßais de restauration des oeuvres d'art (IFROA) established in 1977 and √âcole nationale du patrimoine (ENP) created in 1990. Institut fran√ßais de restauration des oeuvres d'art was used to train conservators and was attached to √âcole nationale du patrimoine in 1996. The establishment of √âcole nationale du patrimoine was linked to the creation of a new profile of French civil servants : the heritage curators, whose missions started from state level and developed to the City of Paris and local government level, thanks to an agreement with Centre national de la fonction publique territoriale (CNFPT). From the beginning, the ambition of the institution has been to ensure the excellence of professionals and to create bridges between two domains Both departments have their own entrance examination, specialties and calendar for the different steps. Teaching= Department of curators = The mission of the department is to recruit candidates through competitive entrance examinations and provide initial training to heritage curators for State civil service, local government civil service authorities and City of Paris. The department is an application school (\\"√©cole d'application\\") for the laureates, who generally devoted previous studies to academic research before entering the academy (university, √âcole du Louvre, √âcole nationale des chartes, √âcole normale sup√©rieure, ...). The status of the students is civil servant as soon as they begin the training. The training lasts 18 months and aims to prepare high rank civil servants and heads of departments, institutions or other, in charge of administration, management, scientific expertise, transmission and enhancement of heritage. The skills which are developed in the Institut national du patrimoine vary : administrative, financial, legal, technical, code of ethics, human resources... The different specialties proposed after successful entry are : archaeology, archives, historical monuments and inventory, museology, scientific, technical and natural heritage. The training is divided in theoretical courses (9 months) and internships in France and abroad (9 months). Internships are generally organized thanks to agreements with institutions of French Ministry of Culture or other Ministries. These training experiences are also organized abroad, within different frameworks. Each year, the department welcomes about 60 students. Conservation du patrimoine sp√©cialit√© patrimoine scientifique, technique et naturel.jpg Conservation du patrimoine sp√©cialit√© mus√©es.jpg = Department of conservators = The mission of the department is to select candidates through a competitive entrance examination and train conservators capable and authorized to work on public collections. The profile of the laureates varies : art historians, scientists, craftsmen, artistic careers... The training lasts 5 years and conservators are rarely civil servants in the French context. It is divided into theoretical and practical courses and internships in France and abroad (9 months). During the 5 years, some internships concern individual students only and some others participate in field-schools or other team experiences on sites. These opportunities as well as conservation on real artworks from public collections are permitted thanks to agreements with institutions of French Ministry of Culture, such as museums, or other Ministries. Internships are also organized abroad (6 months), within different frameworks. Each year the department welcomes about 100 students. On June 22, 2018, the Institut national du patrimoine received the European Union's Cultural Heritage Award / Europa Nostra rewarding the teaching method of the field-schools organized by the department of the conservators.

All candidates must be of French nationality or nationals of a Member State of the European Union or of a State party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. External competitive examinations are open to candidates holding a bachelor's degree (or equivalent). Internal competitive examinations are open to State civil servants, military personnel and judges, civil servants in local government authorities and public institutions. They can be in active employment, on secondment, on parental leave or on military service or in office within an international intergovernmental organisation . About 30 candidates are admitted each year. = Entrance examination to the department of conservators = The competitive examination is open to both French and Foreign candidates, holder of a Baccalaureate certificate or equivalent and under 30 years of age by 31 December of the year preceding admission year. Special exceptions may be granted, according to age and degree, based upon experience already acquired or other specific situations. Seven specialties are proposed for the admissions test: earthenware and glassware (metal, ceramic, glass, enamel), graphic arts and books, Textile arts, Furniture, Painting (easel, mural), photography, Sculpture. About 20 candidates are admitted each year.  Degrees  As the Institut national du patrimoine is placed under the authority of French Ministry of Culture rather than Ministry of Education, it delivers its own degrees which give the title of \\"heritage curator\\" (\\"conservateur du patrimoine\\") for the department of curators and \\"heritage conservator\\" (\\"restaurateur du patrimoine\\") for the department of conservators. The title is accompanied by the name of the specialty in which the person graduated. The level of the 5-year training degree of conservators has been recognized officially as being equivalent to a Master II.  Continuing education  The Inp also proposes a wide range of continuing education programmes for both French and foreign heritage professionals: in Paris (department of curators), in Aubervilliers (department of conservators-restorers), in Marseille (Institut M√©diterran√©en des M√©tiers du Patrimoine I2MP through a collaboration with the MuCEM), or elsewhere in accordance with local authorities. Distance learning courses are also proposed.  Research  The curators have to produce a research project before their graduation in one of these specialties: museums, archaeology, archives, inventory and historical monuments, natural and scientific heritage. The conservators have to produce a technical and scientific research project before graduating and their 5th year is devoted to a conservation work and study in the conservation field of their specialty: Earthenware and glassware (metal, ceramic, enamel, glass), Graphic arts and books, Textile arts, Furniture, Painting, Photography or Sculpture.  Laboratory  The laboratory consists of a team including a research engineer, in charge of the laboratory, specialising in the analysis of organic matter through gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, a project engineer, assistant to the laboratory head, is in charge of analysing modern hybrid matter through infrared spectroscopy, an assistant engineer and assistant to the laboratory head, is in charge of micro x-ray fluorescence and the analysis of inorganic matter. The activity and expertise of the laboratory enters within the framework of the initial training programme of conservators and is located in Aubervilliers. It is equipped with scientific imaging equipment within the establishment including several microanalytical techniques (stereo microscopy and optical microscopy, micro x-ray fluorescence, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, internal reflection infrared spectroscopy : external reflection scanning electron microscopy)... Partnerships exist between the laboratory and research laboratories in the Ministry of Culture (C2RMF, LRMH et CRCC), as well as with mus√©e du Quai Branly, Biblioth√®que nationale de France (National Library of France), Fondation des Sciences du Patrimoine (foundation for Cultural Heritage Sciences), ComUE heSam, Centre Pompidou, Le Corbusier Fundation, Centre national d'Art Plastique (CNAP), Carnot Fundation or The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York.  Resources  The library, located in Aubervilliers, is a place of consultation and research that is, in Europe, the second reference library in the conservation of cultural heritage. The documentation and resource center, located in Paris, regroups the different documents related to the management, conservation and enhancement of cultural heritage.

Early life  Thomas Prosser spent his early years at Wynyard Park. It was here that his father, also Thomas, had been commissioned as architect in the rebuilding of Wynyard Park.  Career  Prosser began his training in the office of architect Ignatius Bonomi (1787-1870) in Durham. It was Bonomi who was one of the designers of the Skerne Railway Bridge for the Stockton and Darlington Railway. The bridge is one of the oldest railway bridges in the world and the oldest still in use. The portico of Newcastle Central Station Prosser then went to Newcastle-upon-Tyne to work at the firm of John Dobson at the Newcastle Central Station project. It was Prosser who did some of the preparatory architectural drawings before going on to become the clerk of works. It was Prosser who drew up the plans for the station portico as a revision to the original design. York Railway Station is another of Prosser's major works, with the train-shed regarded as ‚Äòone of the great cathedrals of the Railway Age‚Äô. Prosser worked on the station in partnership with engineer Thomas Elliot Harrison. 345x345px The Grade II listed signal box at Shildon, believe to have been designed by Thomas Prosser. Suffering with ill heath Prosser retired in May 1874. In recognition of his service the railway company granted Prosser a ¬£300 a year allowance. These payments ran until June 1884 when they were transferred to his brother Robert, whom he was living with after his condition worsened.

The station had waiting facilities where immigrants could meet their ticket agents, wash and use the toilet as well as take shelter from the weather.

Intreccialagli served prior to this as the coadjutor for the archdiocese and before that served as the Bishop of Caltanissetta when he was nominated to the episcopate. He was also the co- founder of the Oblates to the Divine Love which he established alongside the Servant of God Margherita Diomira Crispi. Intreccialagli's process for beatification opened after his death in Monreale and he became titled as a Servant of God. He was later titled as Venerable in 1991 after Pope John Paul II confirmed that he had lived a life of heroic virtue. Life Antonio Augusto Intreccialagli was born in 1852 in Montecompatri as the first of ten children born to Giuseppe Intreccialagli and Annunziata Raffaelli. He made his First Communion in 1862 after having received his Confirmation in 1858. In 1867 he entered the Discalced Carmelites (one brother also entered the order) at their convent at Santa Maria della Scala in Rome and assumed the religious name \\"Antonio di Ges√π\\" upon commencing his period of novitiate. On 19 January 1868 he was vested in the habit for the first time in Santa Maria della Scala. In 1868 he began his philosophical and theological studies in Caprarola and later made his initial profession on 20 January 1868. He made his solemn profession into the order on 20 January 1869 in Santa Maria della Scala into the hands of Fr. Domenico di San Giuseppe. On 19 June 1873 he and some companions sought refuge in the stables at the Farnese Palace after the Caprarola convent was closed in 1872. For months the seminarians ate onions and sometimes starved but he was noted for keeping his fellows occupied with his good humor. Intreccialagli received his ordination to the priesthood in 1875 in the Civita Castellana Cathedral from the diocesan bishop and after ordination lived for a time in the convent attached to Santa Maria della Vittoria while finishing his studies at the Pontifical Gregorian. People often came to him in the convent churches of Santa Maria della Scala and Santa Maria della Vittoria for advice and spiritual direction. People such as Saint Frances Xavier Cabrini and Blessed Maria Therese von W√ºllenweber came to see him as did Venerable Francis Jordan. He was also friends with Blessed Teresa Maria Manetti. He later became the prior for Santa Maria della Scala in 1885 (he was re-elected in 1888) and after that term expired spent a brief period in both Caprarola (to teach) and Montecompatri (as the vicar for the San Silvestro convent from 1883 to 1885). He later was made the provincial for the Roman province of the Discalced Carmelites in 1891 and served two consecutive terms) in office after being re-elected twice in 1897 and 1903. Pope Leo XIII later named him in 1896 as a consulter for both the Congregation for Bishops and Regulars and for the Congregation for Rites. He opened a new convent in Ceprano in 1893 and later allowed in 1906 for the order to return to the ancient Basilica di San Valentino in Terni. From 1902 until 1907 he was the order's general postulator which saw him oversee the order's causes for canonization. Just prior to his episcopal nomination the order held its General Chapter in Rome to elect a new Superior General. Pope Pius X - who knew Intreccialagli well and held him in high esteem - made it clear to the order of his desire to see him elected to the position. This never materialized so the pope said that if the order \\"did not want him then I'll take him\\". The pope sent a handwritten note to him to inform him that he would be appointed as a bishop. This terrified Intreccialagli who went to see the pope in a vain effort to dissuade him from appointing him as a bishop. He relented and received his episcopal consecration as the new Bishop of Caltanissetta a short while later. He visited the pope the following afternoon to thank him. His formal enthronement in his new see was celebrated on 1 November. In Caltanissetta he helped to fund orphanages and travelled to the salt mines to wait for the miners to finish work all so he could meet with them and talk to them. In the aftermath of the 1908 Messina earthquake he welcomed several affected families while he later attempted to help families purchase tickets for immigration to the United States of America. In 1911 the pope named him as an administrator for the Monreale archdiocese since the archbishop there could no longer perform his duties due to advanced age (he was in his nineties). Intreccialagli held that position until 1914 when the pope named him as the coadjutor bishop (with the right of succession). But his entrance into the archdiocese as coadjutor proved difficult due to the modernist doctrine that was fermenting there. It was also there that he began to rail against the Mafia and their actions. In 1919 the archbishop died and Intreccialagli became the Archbishop of Monreale. He slept for four hours each night and made frequent pastoral visits across his archdiocese. He heard confessions each morning in the church of Saint Joseph and oversaw spiritual guidance for people such as Venerable Marianna Amico Roxas. In 1924 he felt exhausted and his doctors advised him to rest. In June 1924 he returned for rest to his hometown but later travelled to Palermo that September in order to attend the National Eucharistic Congress that was to be held there. He later wanted to hold Pontifical Vespers on 7 September but his doctors prohibited him from doing so due to his poor health. His fatigue grew and he soon had troubles swallowing to the point where a nun asked if he was suffering. The bishop replied: \\"I suffer ... it's terrible!\\" He later wanted the Viaticum on 12 September seated on the edge of his bed in his religious habit but asked those present for pardon before being granted the Viaticum. In the evening on 18 September he renewed his religious vows to his confrere Fr. Guglielmo di San Alberto. Intreccialagli died at 4:00am on 19 September. His remains were later relocated in 1936 to the Monreale Cathedral in the Blessed Sacrament chapel. Beatification process The beatification process opened in Monreale in 1952 in an informative process that lasted until 1954. The process collected documents in relation to his life and holiness and also collected a series of witness testimonies to those who either knew the late bishop or could attest to his holiness. Theologians twice approved his spiritual writings in two separate decrees issued on 3 March 1957 and another less than a decade later on 27 February 1964. The formal introduction to the cause came on 14 November 1966 under Pope Paul VI and he became titled as a Servant of God. In Monreale an apostolic process was later conducted from 1975 to 1978 at which point the Congregation for the Causes of Saints validated both processes in Rome on 18 March 1982 prior to receiving the Positio dossier from the postulation in 1987 for assessment. Theologians approved the cause in a meeting held on 27 March 1990 as did the cardinal and bishop members of the C.C.S. on 6 November 1990. Intreccialagli was named as Venerable on 22 January 1991 after Pope John Paul II confirmed that the late bishop lived a model life of heroic virtue.

The characters literally mean \\"ten thousand ‚Äî leaves ‚Äî collection\\", but more likely refer to a collection of a great many poems, or a collection to last for a very long time.  Overview  The literal translation of the kanji that make up the title Man'y≈çsh≈´ (‰∏á ‚Äî Ëëâ ‚Äî ÈõÜ) is \\"ten thousand ‚Äî leaves ‚Äî collection\\". The principal interpretations, according to the twentieth-century scholar , are (i) a book that collects a great many poems, (ii) a book for all generations, and (iii) a poetry collection that uses a large volume of paper. Of these, supporters of (i) can be further divided into (a) those who interpret the middle character as \\"words\\" (koto no ha, lit. \\"leaves of speech\\"), thus giving \\"ten thousand words\\", i.e. \\"many waka\\", including Sengaku, , Kada no Azumamaro and Kamo no Mabuchi, and (b) those who interpret the middle character as literally referring to leaves of a tree, but as a metaphor for poems, including Ueda Akinari, , Masayuki Okada (Â≤°Áî∞Ê≠£‰πã), , and Susumu Nakanishi. Furthermore, (ii) can be divided into: (a) it was meant to express the intention that the work should last for all time (proposed by Keich≈´, and supported by , , Yoshio Yamada, and ); (b) it was meant to wish for long life for the emperor and empress (Shinobu Origuchi); and (c) it was meant to indicate that the collection included poems from all ages (proposed by Yamada). (iii) was proposed by Y≈´kichi Takeda in his Man'y≈çsh≈´ Shinkai j≈ç (Ëê¨ËëâÈõÜÊñ∞Ëß£‰∏ä), but Takeda also accepted (ii); his theory that the title refers to the large volume of paper used in the collection has also not gained much traction among other scholars.  Keich≈´  The reason for this ambiguity was elaborated on (with reference to classical Chinese sources) by Keich≈´ in his work Man'y≈ç Daish≈çki (Ëê¨Ëëâ‰ª£Âå†Ë®ò): In a later edition of the same work, Keich≈´ repeated the above dual explanation, further interpreting the meaning of \\"poem\\" as an elaboration on the meaning \\"word\\" (as in koto no ha), and speculating that the titles of the later Kin'y≈çsh≈´, Gyokuy≈çsh≈´ and Shin'y≈çsh≈´ as utilizing this meaning. He suggested that the title might be meant to express a desire that this collection would last for all time, comparing the title of the later Senzaish≈´. He appears to have shown more support for (ii), but was not certain. No other early Edo period scholar cited as many Chinese precedents in support of their interpretation as did Keich≈´.  Modern scholars  Yoshio Yamada, in his work \\"Man'y≈çsh≈´ Meigi K≈ç\\" (Ëê¨ËëâÈõÜÂêçÁæ©ËÄÉ) advanced the \\"ten thousand ages\\" hypothesis believing it to be the stronger, but the Chinese literature scholar Masayuki Okada in his 1929 work ≈åmi-Nara-ch≈ç no Kan-bungaku (ËøëÊ±üÂ•àËâØÊúù„ÅÆÊº¢ÊñáÂ≠¶) preferred the \\"ten thousand poems\\" interpretation, based on the titles of other works of the period comparing poems to trees or leaves in a forest (Ë©©Êûó shirin, Ê≠åÊûó karin). Torao Suzuki, another Chinese scholar, followed Okada in his paper \\"Man'y≈çsh≈´ Shomei no Igi\\" (‰∏áËëâÈõÜÊõ∏Âêç„ÅÆÊÑèÁæ©, 1951, published in the first volume of the journal Man'y≈ç), noting particularly the title of the (now lost) work Ruij≈´ Karin (È°ûËÅöÊ≠åÊûó). Suzuki took the \\"leaves\\" of the title to be the leaves covering the trees in a forest of poetry (karin). Another Sinologist, Kiyotaka Hoshikawa, went further in his 1952 paper \\"Man'y≈ç Meigi Ronk≈ç\\" (‰∏áËëâÂêçÁæ©Ë´ñËÄÉ, published in the 29th volume of Kokugo to Kokubungaku), citing a Tang-era Chinese work that actually used the phrase man'y≈ç (w√†ny√® in modern Mandarin) in this sense. Following the work of these Chinese scholars, the \\"ten thousand poems\\" hypothesis became more widely accepted. Susumu Nakanishi, in his 1963 book Man'y≈çsh≈´ no Hikakubungakuteki Kenky≈´ (‰∏áËëâÈõÜ„ÅÆÊØîËºÉÊñáÂ≠¶ÁöÑÁ†îÁ©∂), also expressed support for the idea that the title referred to the great number of poems included in the work. Noriyuki Kojima, in the second volume of his 1964 book J≈çdai Nihon Bungaku to Ch≈´goku Bungaku (‰∏ä‰ª£Êó•Êú¨ÊñáÂ≠¶„Å®‰∏≠ÂõΩÊñáÂ≠¶), sided with the \\"ten thousand ages\\" hypothesis, though, gathering all the Chinese sources he could find for both sides and weighing them against each other. Kojima determined that while the majority of the textual references in Chinese sources favoured the \\"ten thousand ages\\" interpretation, this evidence was not strong enough to base one's view purely on the surviving Chinese sources; he instead concluded that \\"ten thousand ages\\" was the better interpretation based on the more likely reasoning of the compiler(s): that they intended for the collection to last for all time. He cited Chinese sources such as the Wen Xuan and the ' that use the character Ëëâ in the sense of \\"age\\", as well as texts that use it to mean \\"leaf\\", in the same contexts where literature is compared to forests and flowers. In his 1972 book Man'y≈çsh≈´ Seiritsu K≈ç (‰∏áËëâÈõÜÊàêÁ´ãËÄÉ), Matsuo Itami (‰ºä‰∏πÊú´ÈõÑ) suggested that the title was provided by Tachibana no Moroe, one of the compilers, to mean \\"ten thousand ages\\", and cited in support of this a passage about Moroe in the Shoku Nihongi that reads \\"ten thousand years immortal, one thousand leaves inheritance\\" (‰∏áÊ≠≥ÁÑ°Á™Æ„ÄÅÂçÉËëâÁõ∏‰ºù).

He began his football career at Highworth Town Football club, and was part of the team which won the Swindon and District Junior Cup of 1912‚Äì1913. First World War Ted joined up with the 5th Battalion Wiltshire Regiment in 1914, being deployed to Gallipoli in July 1915. On 10 August 1915, during the Ottoman assault on Chunuk Bair he and the rest of the 5th Battalion were driven off the hill, he and four other soldiers took refuge in a gully at Salzli Beit where they hid for sixteen days until Lance Corporal Scott and Private Humphries were able to make their way back to friendly lines and along with Captain Greany organize a search party to bring the wounded back. Ted convalesced back in England at Alder Hay hospital having suffered wounds to his left leg. He soon returned to the front, this time with the 6th Battalion Wiltshire Regiment, posted to France. During the Battle of La Boiselle as a part of the Somme campaign he was wounded in the right thigh and returned to England for convalescence. By March the next year he was back in France, this time with the 1st Wiltshire Regiment. He took part in the Battle of Messines Ridge, and was awarded the Military Medal for his role as orderly, carrying messages backwards and forwards from an advanced position between 7 and 10 June, despite being half buried at one point by an exploding shell. He was also promoted to Corporal during August 1917, but was once again wounded, this time in the right arm, later that same month. At this point he was transferred back to England, where he took the opportunity to marry his sweetheart Martha Hayes in December that year. He spent the rest of the war in England with the 3rd Wiltshire Regiment, taking the opportunity to reignite his love of football, playing in, and winning, the 1st Division Sittingbourne Section League in 1917, 1918 and 1919. Eventually promoted to Lance Sergeant, he was transferred to Z reserves and demobilized in March 1919. Between the Wars Ted Clack in 1940 whilst serving with the BEF Post war, Ted continued his passion for football, playing for Pontypridd between 1920‚Äì1921, helping them to win a Welsh Cup medal, and then playing alongside Charles Buchan at Sunderland between 1921 and 1923, winning two Durham Cup medals and a Shipowners club medal, before moving to Bristol City for a season. He became a father twice, first to William Edward Clack in 1919 and then Norman Charles Clack in 1928. Second World War On the outbreak of the Second World war, Ted Clack returned to service, joining the Military Provost Staff Corps at Aldershot in 1939 at the rank of Staff Sergeant. He deployed with the BEF to France in 1940, opening a Field Punishment Camp. As the BEF was pushed out of France, Ted evacuated with his compatriots at Dunkirk. He was then transferred to North Africa to open up a POW camp, but misfortune dogged him again and the troop ship that he was on, the Strathallan was torpedoed and sunk by U-562 on 21 December 1942. Clack survived the sinking, although he spent nine hours in the waters of the Mediterranean, and eventually continued on his way to North Africa and served there for six months before contracting dysentery. This, coupled with the exposure from his time in the sea, and the wounds suffered in the last war was enough for Ted to seek retirement from the forces, and he was discharged on grounds of disablement in July 1943. The family connection with the forces would continue however, with his sons both serving in the Royal Navy, William on board the surface fleet during and after the war, and Norman in the Royal Marines serving in Palestine and the Malayan Emergency. Post- war Following his withdrawal from service, Ted worked as a store-keeper at Sketchleys for eighteen years, but kept his interest in football alive, joining the Stratton Club and associating with the Hinckley Gunners team where he was not adverse to joining them on the field, even in his sixties. He died peacefully in his sleep on 11 April 1984 at his home in St. Clements walk, Cirencester.

Life and career Pesle was born in Le Havre, one of the eleven children of Robert Pesle and Marguerite n√©e de Menil. Her father was a businessman active in the import of wood from France's African colonies. Her mother was the sister of the philanthropist and art patron John de Menil. After completing her studies at the Sorbonne in 1950, she worked at a municipal library in Paris and at the bookstore-gallery , a gathering place for Parisian intellectuals. She received a study grant in 1952 which allowed her to spend two years in the United States where she worked in a Boston bookstore. It was during this initial visit to the United States that Pesle saw the New York debut of the Merce Cunningham Company in 1953. At the time Cunningham was working with the composer John Cage and several avant-garde artists such as Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg, all of whom Pesle came to know. She was quoted in 1985 as saying \\"When I came back to France I wanted everyone to know them.\\" On her return to France, she continued her work at La Hune until 1960 and began promoting Cunningham's work, at first working only with a close circle of friends and art patrons. She then became a director of the Paris branch of the Alexander Iolas galleries. She worked there for the next eleven years, especially with the artists Max Ernst, Ren√© Magritte and Niki de Saint-Phalle, and often made selections of paintings, sculptures, and drawings for important collections, including that of John and Dominique De Menil. From her office in the Iolas gallery Pesle also worked to promote performances by Cunningham and artists associated with his company. She was instrumental in organizing the first European tour of his dance company and its Paris debut at the in 1964. The performance was a controversial one, with some members of the audience throwing tomatoes at the troupe. Undeterred, Pesle said from the wings, \\"On continue, let's prepare the next one\\".Boisseau, Rosita (22 January 2018). \\"Mort de B√©n√©dicte Pesle, qui fit conna√Ætre en France le chor√©graphe Merce Cunningham\\".

Cybersonic Arts: Adventures in American New Music, p. 264. University of Illinois Press. In the early years of Cunningham's appearances in France, filling the theatres was often a problem. With Niki de Saint-Phalle, Jacqueline Matisse Monnier, and three other friends, Pesle established the French Friends of Merce Cunningham. Each of them undertook to bring at least 10 people to his performances and to convince each of those to bring ten people as well, Self- described as Cunningham's \\"pilot fish\\", Pesle remained the dancer's European agent until his death in 2009.Bavelier, Ariane (12 December 2011), \\"Merce Cunningham saga d'une avant-garde\\".

In 1971 Pesle formed the New York-based Performing ArtService (which later became ArtService International) and Modus Vivendi, a foundation to support American artists coming to France. In 1972, she opened her own office in Paris from which she ran ArtService International as a nonprofit organization. During that time she began her long association with , a prominent figure in French cultural life and the Minister of Culture from 1974 to 1976.

Pesle worked as Robert Wilson's representative in Europe up until her final days.

Modern GATT Law: A Treatise on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Sweet & Maxwell. 2005. Page 935. Such a presumption may legitimately arise from a rule of law or a procedural rule of the court or other adjudicating body which determines how the facts in the case are to be proved, and may be either rebuttable or irrebuttable. An irrebuttable presumption of fact may not be challenged by the defense, and the presumed fact is taken as having been proved. A rebuttable presumption shifts the burden of proof onto the defense, who must collect and present evidence to prove the suspect's innocence, in order to obtain acquittal. Rebuttable presumptions of fact, arising during the course of a trial as a result of specific factual situations (for example that the accused has taken flight),This is how presumptions have traditionally been classified: Zuckerman, The Principles of Criminal Evidence, 1989, pp 112 to 115. An irrebuttable presumption of guilt is unconstitutional in the United States: Florida Businessmen for Free Enterprise v. State of Fla. See United States Code Annotated.

Equity in the World's Legal Systems. √âtablissements √âmile Bruylant. 1973. p 559. and contrary to international human rights standards. In the United States, an irrebuttable presumption of guilt is considered to be unconstitutional. Informal and legally illegitimate presumptions of guilt may also arise from the attitudes or prejudices of those such as judges, lawyers or police officers who administer the system. Such presumptions may result in suspects who are innocent being brought before a court to face criminal charges, with a risk of improperly being found guilty. Definition According to Herbert L. Packer, \\"It would be a mistake to think of the presumption of guilt as the opposite of the presumption of innocence that we are so used to thinking of as the polestar of the criminal process and which... occupies an important position in the Due Process Model.\\" The presumption of guilt prioritizes speed and efficiency over reliability, and prevails when due process is absent. In State v. Brady (1902) 91 NW 801, Weaver J said \\"'Presumptions of guilt' and 'prima facie' cases of guilt in the trial of a party charged with crime mean no more than that from the proof of certain facts the jury will be warranted in convicting the accused of the offense with which he is charged\\".

The ship later went into merchant service, and in 1948 under Chinese ownership reportedly became the first all-Chinese ship to visit South America. Radnor was originally ordered as SS War Indian by a private company, but with U.S. entry into World War I in April 1917, she was requisitioned by the U.S. Navy for use as a cargo ship. Commissioned as USS Radnor (ID-3023) in May 1918, the ship spent the remainder of the war transporting cargoes for the Navy. After the war, USS Radnor was converted into a troop transport and used to repatriate U.S. troops home from France. Following decommission, the ship entered mercantile service as the cargo ship SS Radnor, operating under charter from the United States Shipping Board with a succession of private companies, mostly in trade between the United States and the Far East. In 1930, Radnor was sold to the Luckenbach Steamship Company, renamed SS Jacob Luckenbach, and employed in intercoastal service between the East and West coasts of the United States. After America's entry into World War II, Jacob Luckenbach made some long independent voyages to Australia, the Middle East and Far Eastern destinations, before joining the Atlantic convoy system in July 1943. For the next year, the ship made four round trips in convoy across the Atlantic, carrying vital supplies from the United States to Great Britain. In the closing stages of the war, the ship returned to independent service, operating between the United States and South America. In 1947, Jacob Luckenbach was sold to C. Y. Tung fledgling Chinese Maritime Trust and renamed SS Tung Ping. In 1948, Tung Ping reportedly became the first all-Chinese ship to visit Central and South America. In 1950, the ship was sold to Panamanian interests, and operated under the names SS Pacific Dragon and later, SS Oceanic Justice. Oceanic Justice was scrapped in Tokyo, Japan in 1959.

Radnor had three steel decks; four large cargo holds; seven watertight bulkheads; and a double bottom divided into compartments, some of which were designed for holding oil fuel and others water ballast. For handling cargoes, Radnor was fitted with two hinged kingposts, one fore and one aft, each of which mounted four 5-ton booms, plus two additional 5-ton booms amidships and a large, 30-ton boom aft. Additional equipment included 10 steam winches, a steam capstan and steam-powered steering gear. The ship had a single smokestack, and a telescopic mast for wireless transmission placed amidships. For protection against submarines, Radnor was fitted with a four-inch gun forward and a five-inch gun aft, while \\"extra\\" lifesaving equipment included 26 lifeboats, two rafts and a \\"working boat\\". Accommodation for the ship's complement of 75 included officers' quarters in a deckhouse amidships, engineers' quarters in side deckhouses, and crew quarters in the forecastle.

Radnor service began 31 May 1918 when the ship departed Philadelphia \\"with a full army cargo\\" bound for Crist√≥bal, Canal Zone, before proceeding via Callao, Peru, to Antofagasta, Chile, arriving 28 June. Later, Radnor joined two convoys to France, the first arriving at Marseilles 19 September and the second reaching Quiberon 4 January 1919. With the war over, the foreign contingent of the American Cruiser and Transport Force withdrew, leaving the U.S. government short of the transport capacity needed to quickly repatriate the hundreds of thousands of U.S. troops stationed in France. Radnor consequently became one of 56 ships selected for conversion to troop transports,United States Dept. of War. pp. 4974‚Äì75. and was transferred to the Cruiser and Transport Force on 7 March. Radnor was converted to a troop transport by W. & A.

After this, Radnor spent the next seven or eight years operating as a cargo ship between a variety of ports in the United States, including New York, New Orleans and San Pedro, California, and various destinations in the Pacific and Far East including Honolulu, Hawaii; Cebu and Manila, Philippines; Singapore; Hong Kong; and Shanghai, China. In October 1922, Radnor transported the \\"unusually heavy\\" cargo of 10,500 tons of coal from Immingham, England, to Camden, Delaware, reportedly resulting in the ships deck being \\"two feet under water for two days in stormy weather\\" during the voyage. Just prior to this trip, Radnor had employed an American youth in the East Indies who became deranged and attempted to attack the ships captain, L. C. Howard. Placed in irons, the youth managed to escape before being handed over to the American consulate in London. On 31 March 1925, Radnor was grounded off Beagle Island, Philippines while en route to Europe with a cargo of hemp.

Service history = Early service, 1898‚Äì1918 = Following her completion in May 1898, Bahia entered service with the Hamburg‚ÄìSouth American Line. While Bahia particular route is not known, ships of the Hamburg‚ÄìSouth American Line operated between Hamburg, Germany and several localities in Brazil including Bahia, Rio de Janeiro and Santos, S√£o Paulo; to Central America; and between Brazil and New York, United States.\\"Hamburg South American Line\\". www.theshipslist.com. Bahia continued in operation with the Hamburg‚ÄìSouth American Line until the outbreak of World War I in 1914, when she was interned in Montevideo, Uruguay. In 1917, Bahia was seized by the Government of Uruguay and transferred to the United States Shipping Board. Renamed SS Paysandu, the ship departed Montevideo 30 September 1918, arriving at New York shortly after the end of the war on 24 November 1918.\\"Ship Manifest\\". www.libertyellisfoundation.org. = U.S. Navy troop transport, January‚ÄìJuly 1919 = With the foreign contingent of the American Cruiser and Transport Force having withdrawn at the close of the war, the U.S. government needed additional capacity to repatriate U.S. troops from France, and Paysandu consequently became one of 56 ships selected for conversion into troop transports.U.S. Dept. of War 1920. pp. 4974‚Äì75. The ship was converted between 5 January and 1 March 1919 at Hoboken, New Jersey by the W. & A. Fletcher Company, at a cost of $173,360.U.S. Dept. of War 1920. p. 4977. On 29 January, while still undergoing conversion, Paysandu was acquired by the U.S. Navy and commissioned as USS Paysandu (ID-3880). After the conversion, USS Paysandu had a troop-carrying capacity of 25 officers and 1,300 enlisted men, and a crew complement of 21 officers and 168 enlisted men.U.S. Dept. of Commerce 1920. p. 491.

The ship departed St. Nazaire for Newport News, Virginia at 4 pm the same day, with the remainder of the regiment leaving two days later aboard .Thorn 1920. p. 60. The regimental historian notes of the voyage aboard Paysandu that the ship \\"was not in very good condition, as she had been laid up for years in South America and it was impossible to get any speed out of her. She was only 375 feet long and had no cargo in her and pitched and rolled constantly, causing a great deal of seasickness.\\" Nonetheless, the troops were in good spirits as they were homeward bound. Paysandu had better food and accommodations than the troops had enjoyed on their outbound journey to France aboard USS Leviathan, and the troops were permitted on deck more frequently. To help pass the time on Paysandu, the Regimental \\"theatrical talent\\" organized shows and concerts, while \\"moving picture outfits\\" and boxing and wrestling matches provided further entertainment.Thorn 1920. pp. 60‚Äì61. The Regimental barbers were also kept busy, as many of the troops were keen to look their best on their arrival home.Thorn 1920. p. 61. Though Paysandu had departed St. Nazaire two days earlier than Antigone, the latter arrived at Newport News first, on 29 May, with Paysandu docking three days later on the night of Sunday, 1 June, her troops disembarking the following morning. On 3 June, the Regiment departed in two contingents on the steamer Essex for Baltimore, where the returning troops received a reception of such enthusiasm it is said to have \\"resembled a riot.\\"Thorn 1920. pp. 61‚Äì63. After disembarking the 313th, Paysandu made a second voyage to France, returning to the United States 14 July.Gleaves 1921. p. 259. On her two-round trips between France and the United States, the ship repatriated a total of 2,736 troops, including four sick or wounded. Her naval assignments complete, Paysandu was detached from the Cruiser and Transport Force 16 July and decommissioned on the 29th, after which she was returned to the USSB, who in turn re-delivered the vessel to her owners, the Government of Uruguay. = Later history = Following her return to the Uruguayan Government in late 1919, Paysandu re- entered merchant service as SS Paysandu. Little is known about her subsequent career, but the ship is known to have made a couple of voyages to New York in this period, one from Montevideo in May 1920 and another from Buenos Aires, Argentina in January 1923.\\"Ship Search: Paysandu\\". www.libertyellisfoundation.org.

It was published by the Hoover Institution Press, Stanford University. Richard F. Staar served as its editor in chief for most of its editions. The Yearbook was widely regarded as an objective, comprehensive, very detailed, and reliable reference work, with high quality editorial work. Reviewers noted that no other similar vast compilation of worldwide Communist activities had existed prior to the creation of this book series, and becoming \\"the most authoritative word on the subject\\". History=Creation= In a foreword in the first edition, W. Glenn Campbell, Director of The Hoover Institution on War, Revolution, and Peace, stated the following reasons for creating such a volume: > the international communist movement has had a profound impact inupon the > modern world. In the half-century since the Bolshevik Revolution the > movement has expanded steadily. Communist parties now rule in fourteen > countries and are active in some 75 others. At the same time, the movement > has become more complex and fragmented, particularly as divergent tendencies > have arisen in the past dozen years. For these reasons, the Hoover > Institution decided to begin publication of a Yearbook on International > Communist Affairs, a project designed to provide an annual compendium and > reference work for scholars, teachers, students, policymakers, journalists, > and others. In 1971 the Il Politico journal noted that the publication of that year's volume had been possible with the financial support from the Mary Reynolds Babcock Foundation, the Carthage Foundation, the Earhart Foundation, and the Esso Education Foundation. 100px Companion retrospective publication The first edition of the yearbook appeared in conjunction with another publication by the Hoover Institution: World Communism: A Handbook 1918‚Äì1965, which surveyed the historical and structural developments of all communist parties, from their foundation until the end of 1965. The Yearbook then took over to offer documentation for 1966 (and onwards). =Editors and contributors= With some variations, each book had a chief editor, an assistant editor (aided by a \\"small full-time team\\" working at the Hoover Institution), an editorial board or area editors (depending on which edition, at times also called \\"foreign correspondents\\"), and an advisory board (\\"of distinguished scholars in the field of communism and international affairs from both the United States and Western Europe\\"). There was also a large number of expert contributors in covering each of the countries in the Yearbook; these were initially uncredited, but identified in later editions. The lead editors at inception of the series for the 1966 year volume were Milorad M. Drachkovitch and Lewis H. Gann. They were followed by Richard Allen and Milorad Popov. Since 1969 and until the end of the series in 1991, Richard F. Staar was its main editor. =Discontinuation= As the Soviet Union weakened, leading to its dissolution in 1991, Communism as a major global geopolitical factor also faded. As Gerald Segal writing for the International Affairs put it in 1990, the Yearbook while still a \\"reliable\\" and \\"essential\\" reference work, with all the changes in the Communist world, including \\"the breaching of the Berlin Wall and the coming of political pluralism to most of Eastern Europe\\", it was becoming a repository of \\"esoteric history\\" In this context, the Yearbook saw its last edition published covering the year 1991, its 25th anniversary edition. The Washington Post noted how the discontinuation of the Yearbook was a sign of the times, by stating: > In addition to trying to take an active role in the changes sweeping the > Soviet Union, American experts also are seeking new directions for > scholarship that long focused exclusively on communism and the Cold War. In > a symbolic underscoring of how outmoded those topics suddenly have become, > the Hoover Institution has decided that its just published Yearbook of > International Communist Affairs will be the last edition of a work long > regarded as the most authoritative word on the subject. Still, Richard F. > Starr, editor of the Yearbook, thinks it is not yet time to abandon the > strategic studies that long were the underpinning of Soviet scholarship. He > now is concentrating his research on efforts to reform and restructure the > Soviet armed forces. Scope and contents The books series was conceived to be a \\"continuing publication in English on the international political activities of the various communist parties, or on the relations among communists themselves.\\" According to the 1979 edition (and representative of the entire series), the purpose was to provide basic data concerning organizational and personnel changes, attitudes towards domestic and foreign policies, and activities of communist parties and international front organizations through the world. Much of the information came from primary source materials in the native languages. Profiles on each party included founding date, legal or proscribed status, membership, electoral and parliamentary (if any) strength, leadership, auxiliary organizations, domestic activities, ideological orientation, views on international issues, attitude toward the Sino-Soviet dispute, and principal news media. The criterion for a party to be included in the books was its identity as a Marxist‚ÄìLeninist party, and recognized by authoritative communist publications such as the World Marxist Review. That is, parties that were pro-Soviet, pro-Chinese, Castroite, Trostkyist, as well as other rival communist movements. Every edition in the book series covered around 100 parties. International mass organizations under communist leadership were also included. With some variations over the years, the books included the following sections: *Introduction/Overview *Profiles of Individual Communist Parties (by country, constituting the majority of the content of each book) **History **Organization and leadership **Domestic affairs, views and policies **International views and activities **Publications *Register of Communist Parties *Chronology *Survey of International Communist and National Revolutionary Conferences *Description of International Communist Front Organizations *Documents *Biographies of Prominent International Communist Figures *Bibliography *Index by Names, and Subjects The Yearbook averaged over 950 pages in its first few editions, and continuing to oscillate between about 500 to over 1000 pages throughout the duration of the series. Reception=Accolades= The book series was generally very well regarded by scholars. Talking about the first volume J.M. Boche≈Ñski noted that \\"the reviewer does not believe that anything comparable in scope, wealth of information and exactness has been produced by any Communist organization. It will certainly be a standard reference by all scholars interested in Communism, Communist and non-Communist alike. It is hoped that similar volumes will be published for subsequent years.\\" further adding \\"it would be difficult to exaggerate the importance and usefulness of this work\\" Similarly Avakumovic writing for Pacific Affairs concurred, calling it a pioneering work. In subsequent volumes, the series continued to be praised, with multiple academic reviewers describing the book series as being a \\"monumental study\\" having \\"inestimable value for anyone interested in international affairs\\", a scholarly tool very rich in detail and comprehensive in scope, free of cold war jargon, detached and impartial, and overall being a good distillation of the prior year's events into a single volume, and \\"best available Reference on the contemporary communist world\\". The Washington Post reporting on the discontinuation of the book series in 1991, praised it as \\"a work long regarded as the most authoritative word on the subject.\\" =Challenges, limitations, and criticisms= In 1970 the Slavic Review noted that in the 1960s new challenges arose in identifying communist parties and movements, with the scene having become \\"more confused by the appearance of Marxist- oriented-guerrilla and 'New Leftist' movements which also might be designated 'Communist'.\\" The authors coped with the multiplicity and divergence of communist branches by focussing their coverage on those self-described as Marxist‚ÄìLeninist and those recognized by authoritative Communist publications, such as the World Marxist Review. However, the editors did still not \\"face up to (...) the concept of the 'international Communist movement.'\\" Similarly Karl Schmitt writing for The Hispanic American Historical Review in 1972 also shared his concerns that the definition of communist parties had become inadequate. Early in the series some reviewers pointed that the wealth of compiled objective data in the book would have benefitted from providing more interpretation, analysis, and theoretical considerations. Some reviewers concluded that the work reads more like an encyclopedia, dictionary, or \\"catalogue\\" than an \\"analytical perspective\\". On that regard, the American Political Science Review further noted that the work contained \\"too much factual summary\\", however \\"within the framework and strictures of this probably insoluble problem, Staar and his able editorial staff did an outstanding job in offering us invaluable raw materials\\" that are of value to further study of the movement and literature of contemporary international Communist affairs. in 1970, the reviewer for that year's book for Africa Today noted that the Africanists would find the coverage on Africa to be weak, while still noting that the sections with Communist parties in the rest of the world were quite valuable. On the other hand, in 1972 the Journal of Asian History remarked that the Asian countries were thoroughly covered. Some commentators also noted the high price of the first volumes may have put the book out of reach of many, but later that was changed by making it more affordable. Also it was noted that some data from year to year might have been repetitive, as some basic facts about the parties remained the same. The reviewer for Canadian Slavonic Papers wondered \\"Would it not be wiser to prepare revised volume every five or six years and keep it up to date with annual supplements which included only new material?\\" As the new editions changed a bit their format from prior ones, some reviewers lamented the shortening or removal of some sections such as documentation, chronicle, or introduction. Ryszard Szaw≈Çowski writing for Soviet Studies in 1979 opined that some contributing authors for the Yearbook were based far away from their target countries of study, and believing that recruiting contributors closer to their geographical areas of study that would enable them to provide a more nuanced and on-the-ground recounting of facts. A minority of reviewers also questioned some of the relevance of the Yearbook. Charles B. McLane, writing for the Canadian Slavonic Papers asserted in 1972 that there was some irony in the appearance of the series \\"two decades after it was most urgently needed\\", as \\"In the years after World War II, when intense anti-Communist sentiment in Western Europe and the United States coloured the reporting of developments in the Communist world scholars, government officials and the public at large would have profited greatly by the dispassionate appraisals which characterize the Yearbooks\\". However, by the time the Yearbook series appeared, the world communist movement was already \\"a less formidable force in international politics than it once was, or appeared to be.\\", with a small number of countries with significant but already well-studied movements, and many others being marginal and of no meaningful impact in international affairs. Near the end of the series, and shortly after the fall of the Berlin Wall, Gerald Segal writing in 1990 for the International Affairs journal, commented on the declining relevance of the book series as communism as a major geopolitical factor was fading; for \\"those who dare to retain an interest in comparative communism\\" the 1990 volume may continue to offer them an \\"essential\\" \\"meticulous report\\" on the prior year's events, but for most, the events in the communist world had become \\"esoteric history\\".

Black Arrow was originally SS Rhaetia, a passenger-cargo ship built in Germany in 1904‚Äì05 for the Hamburg-America Line. From 1905 to 1914, Rhaetia operated primarily between Hamburg, Germany and South America, though she was also intermittently employed as an immigrant ship to the United States. With the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, Rhaetia was interned at Philadelphia. With the entry of the United States into the war in April 1917, Rhaetia and other German ships interned in U.S. ports were seized by the U.S. government for possible use in the war effort. After repairs, the former Rhaetia went into service with the U.S. Army as a general transport under the names USAT Black Hawk and later USAT Black Arrow, making five round trips between the United States and France from June 1917 to the end of the war in November. The ship was then converted into a troop transport in order to assist with the repatriation of U.S. troops from France. Commissioned into the U.S. Navy as USS Black Arrow (ID-1534), the ship subsequently made three round trips to France from April to July 1919, returning a total of 4,759 troops to the United States, before decommissioning in August. Reverting to the name SS Black Arrow following her naval decommission, the vessel was given a refit before being chartered by the United States Shipping Board to the American Line. She then recommenced merchant service as a passenger-cargo ship, inaugurating a new service from New York to Black Sea and Near East ports, and in December 1919 became the first ship to return to the United States from Constantinople since the outbreak of the war. After only one more voyage to the Near East however, the ship was given another refit and chartered to the Ward Line for service between New York and Spain. In August 1921, on her fourth voyage to Spain, Black Arrow ran aground off the Spanish coast at Cape Vilan. Refloated, she was returned to New York in November but saw no further service. After being laid up for an extended period, she was scrapped at New Jersey in late 1924.

She was fitted with accommodation for 100 first-class and 800 third-class (steerage) passengers, which included \\"all modern appliances for lighting, heating and refrigeration.\\" Her original cargo capacity is not known, but in later American service it was listed as 330,330 cubic feet bale or 356,229 cu grain.

Rhaetia had a service speed of .  Service history = Hamburg‚ÄìAmerica Line, 1905‚Äì17 = Though built for service between Hamburg, Germany and South America, Rhaetia made her maiden voyage to New York due to a then-prevailing heavy demand for immigrant ships, clearing Hamburg 27 May 1905 and arriving 10 June. She departed on the return journey to Hamburg, via Plymouth, England, and Cherbourg, France, on 17 June, her berths filled with American vacationers to the continent. A second immigrant voyage was then made, clearing Hamburg 8 July and returning 10 August. After this, the ship apparently transferred to her planned Hamburg to South American service. In late 1905, Rhaetia, her sister ship Rugia and two other ships of the Hamburg- America Line, Arcadia and Andalusia, were chartered by the Imperial Russian government to embark Russian troops‚Äîprobably ex-prisoners of war captured during the recently concluded Russo-Japanese War‚Äîat Nagasaki, Japan, the four ships clearing that port 19 December for Vladivostok. Rhaetia then resumed her South American service, where she would remain for several years. In 1909, Rhaetia briefly returned to United States service, making two round trips between Hamburg and Philadelphia from 24 March to 22 June; the first of these trips, on the outbound leg from Hamburg, was made via New York. The vessel then returned to South American service, and is known to have made voyages to Brazil in 1910 and 1911. In 1914, Rhaetia was returned to service between Hamburg and the United States for a third and final time, this time with an initial destination port of Boston. The return leg of these voyages was originally to be made via Queenstown, Ireland and Boulogne, France, but at the last moment the British port of call was changed to Plymouth, England, disappointing Queenstowns city fathers who had planned a civic reception for the ship. A total of three round trips between Hamburg and Boston were eventually made by Rhaetia, the first departing Hamburg 17 January and the last clearing Boston 9 May. On the first of these round trips, Rhaetia arrived at Boston with 11 cabin and 119 steerage passengers‚Äîa typically small passenger list for a winter voyage. She departed 5 February with five cabin and 34 steerage passengers‚Äîof whom half the latter were rejected immigrants‚Äîand cargoes which included \\"3000 boxes of scythe stones for the Russian farming district, flour, asbestos, 20 carloads agricultural machinery, and general merchandise.\\" Rhaetia was then switched to the Philadelphia route, departing Hamburg 7 July and arriving at Philadelphia on the 22nd. The vessel was due to leave on the return journey to Hamburg 1 August with 50 cabin and 150 steerage passengers and a \\"large general cargo\\", but on the same day, Germany entered World War I by declaring war on Russia, and the Hamburg‚ÄìAmerica Line suspended its services indefinitely. Rhaetias stranded cabin-class passengers were given the choice of either receiving a full refund or transferring to the neutral American steamer Merion, leaving the same day, with many taking the latter option. Rhaetia was subsequently interned at Philadelphia, guarded by a round-the-clock police watch. In late August, negotiations between the U.S. government and the German consulate raised the possibility of the sale or transfer to U.S. registry of the ship, but neither eventuated. In March 1915, W. R. Grace & Co. made an offer of $2,000,000 for the purchase of both Rhaetia and her stablemate Prinz Oskar, also in internment at Philadelphia, but this proposal too was unsuccessful and the two ships were to remain in internment until Americas entry into the war in April 1917. During the internment period, many members of the two ships' crews applied for United States citizenship, with about 60 having their applications accepted. = Seizure and U.S. Army service, 1917‚Äì1919 = Rhaetia (left) and Prinz Oskar in internment at Philadelphia On 1 February 1917, Germany resumed unrestricted submarine warfare, in response to which, the United States broke diplomatic relations on the 3rd. On the latter date, acting on instructions from Washington, Philadelphias port authorities confined the crews of German ships interned in the port, including the crew of Rhaetia, to their vessels, while strengthening the guard over the ships. On 6 April, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a joint resolution declaring the United States to be in a state of war with Germany. A little over 2 1/2 hours later, at 5:30 am, customs and immigration officials, accompanied by a contingent of 41 US Marines, gathered at the Christian Street dock where Rhaetia and Prinz Oskar were berthed, to seize the ships on behalf of the United States Shipping Board and take their crews into custody. The operation began about 5:40 am, waking the crews in the process, with each crew member permitted to gather his belongings under the watchful eye of an armed marine. While no resistance was encountered, it was discovered during the operation that five of the 41 crewmen were missing, having apparently deserted their ships. The remaining 36 crew were taken to the Gloucester immigration station to be detained pending determination of their status; three of the missing sailors were located a few days later and similarly detained. Rhaetias crew and those of several other interned German ships were eventually relocated from Gloucester to a prison camp facility in Hot Springs, North Carolina. After the seizure of Rhaetia and Prinz Oskar, customs officials quickly discovered that their crews had sabotaged the ships' engines to prevent or delay their possible utilization in the U.S. war effort. In Prinz Oskars case, the order to sabotage had reportedly been relayed from the chief engineer of the Hamburg America Line when the U.S. had broken diplomatic relations with Germany on 3 February; in Rhaetias case however, her commander testified that he had ordered the sabotage on his own cognizance prior to that date. After temporary repairs at the Christian Street dock, both ships were towed to the shipyard of William Cramp & Sons for more comprehensive repairs. While repairs were initially estimated to take about six months, work on the two vessels was completed much more quickly than anticipated, and by June Rhaetia was back in service as a U.S. Army transport under the name USAT Black Hawk. During the war, the ship embarked on five round trips between New York and various French and other European ports on the Armys behalf. In August 1917, on a voyage to Italy, the ship was reportedly attacked by submarine, albeit unsuccessfully, in the Mediterranean. On an unknown date during her Army service, Black Hawk was renamed USAT Black Arrow. On her fifth and final voyage for the Army, Black Arrow returned to New York from Gibraltar on 19 December 1918 with eight officers and 115 enlisted men; on arrival, the ships officers described how they had witnessed the sinking of , torpedoed 9 November in the Mediterranean‚Äîone of the last ships sunk by enemy action in the war. = U.S. Navy troop transport, 1919 = Stern view of USS Black Arrow in port in 1919, probably in New York Harbor With the war over, the British contingent of the American Cruiser and Transport Force withdrew, leaving the United States with insufficient tonnage needed to quickly repatriate U.S. troops from Europe. To rectify the problem, a total of 56 ships under the control of the U.S. government, including Black Arrow, were selected for conversion into troop transports.United States War Dept. 1919. pp. 4974‚Äì76. Black Arrow was converted by the Morse Dry Dock and Repair Company of Brooklyn between 17 January and 15 March 1919, at a cost of $170,938‚Äîin the process becoming the first ship raised by the Morse Companys new floating dock, the largest of its type in the world. While still undergoing conversion, the ship was commissioned into the U.S. Navy on 27 January as USS Black Arrow (ID-1534), with Lieutenant Commander Walter S. Lynch, USNRF, placed in command. After conversion, the ship had a passenger capacity of 85 officers and 1,510 enlisted men, and a crew complement of 21 officers and 96 enlisted men,United States Dept. of Commerce 1920, p. 490. Black Arrow subsequently made three round trips between the United States and France to repatriate troops.Gleaves 1921. pp. 254‚Äì55. On the first of these, the ship departed New York for Brest, France on or about 6 April, making the return voyage between 26 April and 6 May, carrying artillery units of 82nd Division and a variety of other troops including a heavy mobile ordnance repair shop, the 34th evacuation hospital and casual units‚Äî1,585 men in total. Departing New York 13 May, Black Arrow returned to Brest, then continued on to Bordeaux before clearing that port on the 31st for Newport News, Virginia, where on 13 June she arrived to disembark eight casual and two transportation companies, a bakery company, the 20th evacuation hospital and several sanitary squads. Black Arrows third and final repatriation voyage departed Bordeaux 7 July, arriving at New York on or about the 20th with nine motor companies, the 713th service park company, 53d guards company, ten casual companies and miscellaneous troops. Altogether, Black Arrow returned a total of 4,759 troops to the United States on her three troop repatriation voyages, including 25 sick or wounded. With her naval service complete, Black Arrow was decommissioned at Norfolk, Virginia, on 9 August 1919‚Äîthus reverting to the name SS Black Arrow‚Äîstruck from the Naval Vessel Register the same day, and returned to the control of the United States Shipping Board. = American Line, 1919‚Äì20 = Advertisement for Black Arrows first voyage to the Near East with the American Line, September 1919. After decommissioning from the Navy on 9 August, Black Arrow proceeded to New York on the 15th, where passenger accommodations were refitted and \\"various minor hull and machinery repairs\\" completed.United States Shipping Board 1920. p. 128. She was then chartered by the USSB to the American Line, a subsidiary of International Mercantile Marine, to inaugurate a new service to Near East and Black Sea ports including Constan»õa, Rumania, and Constantinople, Turkey.Bonsor 1979. III. p. 935. Black Arrows initial voyage to the Near East was originally scheduled for departure from New York on 15 September, but was rescheduled for the 25th. On the 23rd, a rumor circulated that the ship was being loaded with munitions bound for General Anton Denikins White Army, then engaged in warfare with Bolshevik forces in Russia. The U.S. State Department denied knowledge of any such shipment, while officials of both the American Line and the USSB declined to comment; however, the arms shipment to Denikin was later apparently confirmed, with the destination port given as Novorossiysk. Black Arrow departed New York for Constantinople and other ports on 25 September, returning via Smyrna 28 December, in the process becoming the first ship to return to the United States from Constantinople since the outbreak of World War I. The ship returned with 103 passengers including American relief workers who had been stationed in Anatolia, some of whom were willing to speak of their experiences in the region, in particular, the plight of Armenians still living there who had survived the recent genocide. One of the relief workers, a chaplain in the U.S. Army Reserve, described how the relief commission had set up a marriage bureau in Broussa to assist Armenian girls, rescued from harems since the wars end, to find husbands willing to take them; according to the chaplain, the bureau was proving quite successful. Another of Black Arrows passengers was an Armenian woman of letters who, after surviving many horrors, had been spared the harem experience by a compassionate Ottoman official who found her a position as a servant in his household. Black Arrows cargoes on this voyage included a gift of a bronze book \\"from the people of Bulgaria\\" to Mrs. Andrew Carnegie in appreciation of her late husbands philanthropy. On 2 January, the USSB offered a number of ex- German ships in its possession for sale, including Black Arrow, on condition that they be employed on routes set by the Board. An offer of $700,000 was eventually made by the Oriental Navigation Company, but the sale did not eventuate. In the meantime, Black Arrow embarked on a second voyage to the Near East, with ports of call including Constantinople, Smyrna, Varna, Bulgaria, and Constan»õa. Departing New York on the 21st, the ship returned via Gibraltar and Madeira, Spain, clearing the latter port 21 March and arriving at New York 2 April. Her passengers on the return trip included the captain and 39 crew of the ship Natenna, an American wooden-hulled freighter built during the war which had been lost off Casablanca, Morocco, on 8 March. Black Arrows return cargoes included $119,000 of antique and new Persian rugs‚Äîreportedly the first such shipment to the United States since the end of the war‚Äîwhich were later offered at retail prices ranging from $59 to $2,250. = Ward Line, 1920‚Äì21 = On 7 May 1920, a few weeks after Black Arrows return from her second voyage to the Near East, the ship was allocated by the USSB to a new managing operator, the New York and Cuba Mail Steamship Company, better known as the Ward Line, for service between New York and Spain. On 11 May, she departed New York for Boston to undergo a $400,000 recondition and refit at the Boston Navy Yard. The ships passenger accommodations at this time were rebuilt to accommodate 80 first-class and 560 steerage class passengers, including the installation of three new multi-room suites, the addition of subdivided compartments for families, and the renovation and refit of steerage quarters and redecoration of the entire ship. Reconditioning work on the vessels machinery included the installation of new boilers, furnaces, feed pump, heater generators and an independent emergency generator. While work on Black Arrow proceeded, the USSB again advertised the vessel for sale. Four bids were submitted, and when opened 30 September, the highest was found to be from the Polish American Navigation Corporation with an offer of $1,150,000. The USSB deferred on this offer, choosing instead to re-advertise the vessel for sale along with another ex-German ship, SS Orion (originally the Prinz Oskar, Black Arrows former HAPAG stablemate). Two bids were received by the closing date of 25 October and opened the same day, with the Polish-American Navigation Corp. again proving to be the highest bidder for Black Arrow with a slightly increased offer of $1,175,000. The second offer, a bid of $1,750,000 for both ships, was later withdrawn. On 10 November, the USSB rejected the Polish-American Corps offer, reverting instead to its original plan to charter the vessel to the Ward Line. In early December, the ship proceeded to New York to begin service with her new operator, but on the 6th, her steering gear became disabled in the Ambrose Channel and she was towed into port by tugboat. Black Arrow would subsequently make four round trip voyages between New York and Spain for the Ward Line. The outgoing leg of these voyages was usually made via Havana, Cuba, while the ships regular Spanish ports of call included Vigo, A Coru√±a, Gij√≥n, Santander and Bilbao. On the first of these voyages, Black Arrow departed New York 18 December 1920, returning 5 February 1921 with 47 passengers, but on the return trip her steering gear broke down once again and she was towed into port at New York by harbor tugs. On her second such voyage, the steamer cleared New York 11 February for Vigo via Havana, returning to New York 7 April, her passengers on the homeward leg including three shipwrecked American sailors‚Äîrescued by the Dutch ship Zeelandia some days earlier‚Äîand 75 Spanish steerage-class passengers. On 23 April, Black Arrow departed New York on her third trip to Spain, but first made a diversion to Tampico, Mexico, where on 22 May she disembarked 445 Chinese steerage-class passengers who had travelled to New York from Hong Kong via the United States Pacific Coast. The Chinese‚Äîa mixture of merchants, laundrymen, market gardeners, cooks and laborers mostly bound for Mexican oil fields‚Äîreceived a hostile reception at Tampico, where they were stoned by Mexican dockside workers. After returning from A Coru√±a on 25 June, Black Arrow departed on her fourth and final voyage to Spain on 12 July. On 9 August, a few days after calling at Las Palmas, Canary Islands, the steamer went aground at Cape Vilan, Spain. The passengers were safely disembarked, but the steamer sank on the 11th and ship and cargo were reported to be a total loss. However, salvage attempts began shortly thereafter, with Black Arrows crew remaining aboard to assist and the Spanish naval ship Dorado standing by. On 1 September, the ship was successfully refloated, after which she was towed to A Coru√±a and later, by the wrecking tug Warbler, to Bilbao On 3 November, Black Arrow cleared Bilbao for New York, arriving at her destination on the 17th.  Later history  In early January 1922, a few weeks after Black Arrows return to New York, the vessel was offered for sale by the USSB, \\"as is, where is\\". Later, she was laid up in the Passaic River, New Jersey, for an extended period. By 1924, Black Arrow and several other ex-USSB ships had been acquired by H. L. Crawford & Co. for the purpose of testing a new ship-breaking method which the firms proprietor, H. L. Crawford, hoped would prove competitive with foreign yards. Crawford founded a new $75,000 firm, the American Ship Breaking Company, and established a shipbreaking plant at Howland Hook, New Jersey. In September 1924, Black Arrow had her machinery removed on Crawfords behalf at the Shupe Terminal Company, Kearny, New Jersey, after which the ship was to be taken to the Howland Hook plant for dismantling of the hull.

Heading north to Altachullion townland Geography Altcrock is bounded on the north by Altateskin townland, on the west by Derrynananta Lower and Gowlan townlands and on the east by Owencam townland. Its chief geographical features are Mullaghroe mountain, a small mountain lake, the Owensallagh river (A source of the River Blackwater, County Cavan), a mountain stream, waterfalls, forestry plantations, gravel pits, a spring and dug wells. Altcrock is traversed by the L1019 public road and rural lanes. The townland covers 569 statute acres. There are several sub-divisions in the townland, including Benn Altcrock (The Peak of Altcrock); The White House, a spring well where the gentry used to lunch when on shooting-parties.

History In earlier times the townland was probably uninhabited as it consists mainly of bog and poor clay soils. It was not seized by the English during the Plantation of Ulster in 1610 or in the Cromwellian Settlement of the 1660s so some dispossessed Irish families moved there and began to clear and farm the land. A lease dated 17 September 1816 John Enery of Bawnboy includes Altcrock.

Root cause  Light emitted from lighting equipment such as luminaires and lamps may vary in strength as function of time, either intentionally or unintentionally. Intentional light variations are applied amongst others for warning, signalling (e.g. traffic-light signalling, flashing aviation light signals), entertainment (like stage lighting), metrology (strobe light for measurement of rotation speed), navigation (like optical beacons, lighthouses) or for communication (Li-FiOptical communication in general, including visible light communication, signal lamps and alike.). Generally, the light output of lighting equipment may also have unintentional light level modulations due to the lighting equipment itself. The magnitude, shape, periodicity and frequency of the TLM will depend on many factors such as the type of light source, the electrical mains-supply frequency, the driver or ballast technologySee root causes of flicker in Fluorescent lamp lemma. and type of light regulation technology applied (e.g. pulse-width modulation). These TLM properties may vary over time due to aging effects, component failure or end-of-life behavior. Furthermore external factors such as incompatibility with dimmers or presence of mains-supply voltage fluctuations (power-line flicker) play a role. TLMs are also known from non-electrical lighting sources like candle light or they may be experienced while driving along a row of trees lit by the sun or by driving through a tunnel lit by luminaires having a certain spacingSee flicker problems in the Queensway Tunnel. __TOC__  Categories of temporal light effects  Obviously, the intentional TLMs listed under 'Root cause' above result into wanted effects. In many cases TLMs may cause unacceptable annoying effects such as flicker or stroboscopic effect that can directly be perceived by humans. These effects are categorized as temporal light artefacts (TLAs)CIE TN 006:2016, Visual Aspects of Time-Modulated Lighting Systems ‚Äì Definitions and Measurement Models (pdf).. Apart from annoyance, flicker may induce epileptic reactions in susceptible people (photosensitive epilepsy).

Biography  Born in Pantin, Chaignaud studied singing with R√©gine Crespin and Gabriel Bacquier at the Conservatoire de Paris, then entered the √âcole d'Art Lyrique of the Paris Opera where he participated in the master classes of Christa Ludwig and Hans Hotter. After making his debut in 1988 at the musical May in Bordeaux and at the Ossiachersee Festival in Austria, he was hired by Herbert von Karajan for the role of Silvano in Un ballo in maschera by Verdi, along Pl√°cido Domingo, Josephine Barstow and Sumi Jo, recorded for Deutsche Grammophon (1989). A staging by John Schlesinger of this production, this time under the baton of Sir Georg Solti, is directed for the Salzburg Festival in 1989 and 1990 and also filmed (Arthaus/TDK, 1990). His training with the German mezzo-soprano Christa Ludwig is decisive for her career, as she recounts in her memoirs \\"My voice and me\\" during a dithyrambic passage on the talent of this baritone of a \\"very beautiful voice\\" and who \\"sings well with musicality\\". During a first and only audition for the role of Figaro at the Vienna State Opera, director Eberhard W√§chter immediately gave Chaignaud a multi-year contract, propelling him into a career on major international stages.(), Ma voix et moi (...und ich w√§re so gern Primadonna gewesen), Christa Ludwig, √âditions Les Belles Lettres/Archimbaud, 1996. During the 1991-1992 season at the Vienna State Opera, he embodied the character of Belcore in Donizetti's L'elisir d'amore alongside the Italian tenor Luciano Pavarotti and Marcello in Puccini's La boh√®me with the Italian soprano Mirella Freni. His work with these two great performers, \\"mythical couple of opera\\", with whom he shared the stage several times in Vienna and Paris, had a great influence on his approach to singing and on the evolution of his career. In 1993, the French critics praised him for his workAdrienne Lecouvreur, G√©rard Mannoni, Le Quotidien de Paris, 23 December 1993; Ticket gagnant, Alain Lompech, Le Monde, 22 December 1993; Adrienne Lecouvreur: for the voices, Herv√© Pennven, Pr√©sent, 25 December 1993. with the Italian soprano Mirella Freni. His work with these two great performers,\\"mythical couple of opera\\", with whom he shared the stage several times in Vienna and Paris, had a great influence on his approach to singing and on the evolution of his career. In 1993, the French critics praised him for his work. The first French national daily newspaper Le Figaro described Jean-Luc Chaignaud as a \\"stage prodigy\\", \\"dazzling with humanity and tenderness\\" and praised his voice \\"marvellously conducted, iridescent with beautiful colours\\".Pour Mirella, Pierre Petit, Le Figaro, 22 December 1993 ; Jean-Luc Chaignaud, Baryton admirable, dir.

Mainly known for the roles of Lescaut in the operas Manon by Massenet alongside Ren√©e Fleming, Marcello in La Boh√®me by Puccini alongside Roberto Alagna, and Escamillo in Carmen by Bizet directed by Franco Zeffirelli, he sings in a repertoire that includes operas by Mozart, Verdi, Donizetti, Puccini and Bizet, in major theatres such as the Metropolitan Opera of New York, the Paris Opera, the Vienna State Opera, La Scala of Milan, the Grand theatre of Liceu of Barcelona, Carnegie Hall in New York, the Royal Albert Hall London, the Bavarian State Opera of Munich and the Peking opera. Over the course of more than thirty years of his international career, Chaignaud has performed a wide variety of repertoires and styles throughout the world: The Italian repertoire of Bel canto but also the Baroque, lieder, oratorio and contemporary Music such as √áa Ira by Roger Waters. His recordings include an exceptional recital at the Louvre of the Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen by Mahler with the Quatuor Arditti under the direction of Michel B√©roff on the occasion of the reopening of the museum in 1989, Adriana Lecouvreur by Cilea with Mirella Freni (La sept Arte/Op√©ra national de Paris, France Musique, 1994), Massenet's Manon with Ren√©e Fleming (Arthaus, 2009), Donizetti's L'elisir d'amore with Rolando Villaz√≥n (Virgin Classics, 2010) and a tribute to the Franco-Monegasque poet-songwriter-performer L√©o Ferr√© at the Op√©ra de Monte-Carlo (OPMC Classics, 2014).

She was a British chemist primarily known for her high publication output during the late 1800s. Aston earned bachelor's degrees in both chemistry and geology from University College London before beginning her research career. She studied a broad range of topics, including mineral analysis, atomic weight determination, and organic structure studies, and was most famous for her work on molecular surface energies with Sir William Ramsay between 1893 and 1902. Aston appeared on 14 publications over a sixteen-year period (1886-1902); a \\"notable feat\\" for women chemists during that time period. She was appointed a science research scholarship by Her Majesty's Commissioners in 1895 to proceed with research that would be beneficial to the country.  Academic career  Emily Aston began her early education at Queen's College, London and Bedford College between the years of 1883 and 1885. During this time, she was able to conduct her first research in chemistry and crystallization under Spencer Pickering, a professor at Bedford College. The research work was over the investigation of multiple sulfates. In 1885, Aston left Bedford College and enrolled in University College, London where she studied geology, mathematics and chemistry, earning her B.Sc. in geology and chemistry in 1889. Over the next ten years, Aston continued her research at University College, London, focusing on analytical chemistry and collaborating in several research projects with the men on staff, including geologist Thomas George Bonney. In the late 1890s, Aston left University of College, London and spent time conducting research at the University of Geneva, Switzerland with Philippe Auguste Guye on optical rotation, and at the Sorbonne in Paris with Paul Dutoit on electrolytic conductivity and molecular association. After her time in France and Switzerland, Aston's name never appeared on any other publications. According to census information of 1901 and 1911, her occupation was shown as \\"private means.\\" She was thought to have dropped out of research all together, and on March 18, 1948, she was pronounced dead in Uckfield, Sussex.  Publications  Aston's first works were published in the Journal of the Chemical Society, Transactions in 1886 while she was attending Bedford College. Most of Aston's publications were joint publications, accompanying John Norman Collie on organic structure studies, James Walker on physical chemistry, and Sir William Ramsay on mineral analysis and atomic weight determination. Her highlighted works include a series of publications with Ramsay during the 1893-1902 time period that focused on molecular surface energy of mixtures of non-associating liquids. In the year of 1895, Aston received a science research scholarship by Her Majesty's Commissioners. During her time researching electrolytic conductivity and molecular association at Sorbonne, she co-authored two publications with Paul Dutoit. Emily Aston is known for her high publication output during the 16 year time period between 1886 and 1902. During this time, she co-authored 18 publications over a broad range of topics including mineralogy, organic chemistry, inorganic chemistry and physical chemistry.

Its chief geographical features are the Owensallagh river (A source of the River Blackwater, County Cavan), mountain streams, forestry plantations and a spring. Altnadarragh is traversed by minor roads and rural lanes. The townland covers 379 statute acres. History In earlier times the townland was probably uninhabited as it consists mainly of bog and poor clay soils. It was not seized by the English during the Plantation of Ulster in 1610 or in the Cromwellian Settlement of the 1660s so some dispossessed Irish families moved there and began to clear and farm the land.

It is said that the charges were entirely politically motivated by the then occupying authorities. In 1848 the year his own father died, he was finally convicted and sent into Russian exile in Kursk for six years. On his return to Poland, a victim of Russian political repression, he never again participated in public life. Background He was born amid profound political turbulence in his nation, while his mother had sought sanctuary with her young family in the Czech capital, and his father was engrossed in affairs of state in Poland. He was the seventh of ten children and fifth of seven sons of two well connected Polish nobles, Tekla Teresa ≈Åubie≈Ñska, a writer and dramatist and Felix ≈Åubie≈Ñski, a jurist and future minister of justice in the Duchy of Warsaw, soon (1796) to be granted the hereditary title of count by Frederick Wilhelm III of Prussia.

After home tutoring, Henryk entered the Warsaw law school founded by his father in 1808. Having completed his studies there, he continued law studies in Paris. He returned to Poland aged 25 and married Irena Potocka. He bought his eldest brother's estate at Kazimierza Wielka and in 1818 he settled there with his wife for a time. There he planned his first sugar processing plant, a project brought to fruition by one of his nephews, Kazimierz. In 1820 he was appointed counsel to his voivodeship and completed a higher law degree at Warsaw University in 1826. Career His property portfolio was extensive and scattered: he owned estates in Czƒôstocice, Wiskitki, Guz√≥w, Kazimierza Wielka, Ostrowiec ≈öwiƒôtokrzyski, Firlej Lublin Voivodeship and Lubart√≥w. He collaborated in a great range of industrial and business start-ups. He initiated coal mining at in DƒÖbrowa G√≥rnicza with a capital loan from the Bank Polski. Incidentally, the bronze cast memorial to him with his bust, unveiled in 1839, was the first such casting made in Poland from a coal fired Smelting at Huta Bankowa. He founded the Sugar factory at Guz√≥w in 1829 and another sugar plant at Czƒôstocice in 1839.Przyrembel, Zygmunt. (1927).

His own firm lasted ten years from 1840 to 1850. In the same voivodeship at Firlej, he opened the first Ironworks near the mineral quarry at the village of Serock. Thus he was able to initiate the first local metal production line for agricultural machinery and implements, including scythes. He also opened factories at ≈ªyrard√≥w, Starachowice and in Ostrowiec ≈öwiƒôtokrzyski. In 1829, he became a director of Bank Polski, and then between 1832 and 1842, he rose to be its vice president.

The court case lasted six years. Finally, in 1848, the year the ≈Åubie≈Ñski clan patriarch, Felix Walezjusz, died in his 90th year, Henryk ≈Åubie≈Ñski was convicted and sentenced to a year in prison, but after interventions it was commuted to exile in Kursk for five years.

Henryk died, like his father, aged 90, and was buried in Wiskitki.

That ≈Åubie≈Ñski was an anglophile, possibly as a result of his British business contacts and a presumed visit to Wentworth Woodhouse, is attested by the fact that he gave his second son, born in 1821, the English name \\"Wentworth\\". This connection endured through the generations of his line as, later in the 19th century, two family descendants settled in England and married into English families, the de la Barre Bodenhams and the Grimshaws.

It operates in two segments: easyfinancial, which offers high-interest loans to subprime borrowers, and easyhome, which sells furniture and other durable goods on a rent-to-own basis. As of 2016, easyfinancial had $344 million in loans, and goeasy had a market value of $400 million as of March 2017. In 2018, easyfinancial had an $834 loan book, revenues of $506 million an increase of 26% over the prior year.goeasy 2018 annual report It is listed as GSY on the Toronto Stock Exchange.  History  Goeasy Ltd. was founded in 1990 as RTO Enterprises. It went public on the Toronto Stock Exchange in 1993, through a reverse takeover. Its original focus was leasing furniture. The company's original focus was offering customers furniture and appliances through a lease-to-own model. In 2003, it renamed itself easyhome, as an attempt to create a nationwide brand, and subsequently went on to become Canada's largest lease-to-own company with stores across Canada. In 2008, easyhome acquired Insta-Rent for $10 million. Around this time, the company launched easyfinancial, its financial services arm. easyfinancial was responsible for most of the growth of the company in the following years, with the easyfinancial segment eclipsing the easyhome segment in revenue by 2016. In 2012, easyhome was forced to re-state its financial statements, and the majority of its board of directors resigned. In March 2014, there was speculation that easyhome might acquire some of the locations of struggling payday lender Cash Store. After Cash Store went out of business, easyhome acquired 47 former Cash Store locations in early 2015. In 2016, easyhome changed its corporate name to goeasy, retaining the easyhome name for its rent-to-own durable good business. The change was made to reflect the increasing diversity of the company's activities. In 2017, the company recapitalized the business with $530 million in financing to help fuel its future growth. During this time, the company also launched a secured lending product to provide homeowners with lower rates and higher loan amounts. The company also expanded into the Quebec market under easyfinanci√®re, and also added lending services at its Easyhome locations. In 2018, David Ingram, who had been President and CEO since 2001, took on a new role as Executive Chairman of the board. Jason Mullins, who previously held the role of Chief Operating Officer, became President and CEO in January 2019. That same year, the company also launched its next-generation proprietary online loan application as well as creditplus, its secured savings loan that helps customers rebuild their credit.  Operations  Easyfinancial and easyhome principally target customers whose credit is not good enough for a bank loan, but is better than that of users of payday loans. Goeasy's customers are often non-prime Canadians trying to rebuild credit. Easyhome, Canada's largest lease-to-own company has been in operation since 1990, and consists of leasing furniture, appliances, and electronics to customers on a rent-to-own basis, which can be transacted online or at one of their 165 locations across Canada. Customers generally own the product at the end of the lease term. No down payment or credit checks are required, but Easyhome claims that it charges an interest rate of 29.9% on its leases with flexible options. However, the total effective interest rate might be higher, given easyhome's higher initial prices in comparison to other retailers. Easyfinancial principally offers installment loans of $500 to $15,000, mainly unsecured, at interest rates from 30% to 50%. It also offers a suite of both unsecured and secured lending products up to $35,000 with rates starting at 19.99%. Easyfinancial operates through in-store kiosks, as well as stand-alone branches and an online website. It had 210 kiosks and branches as of 2016. In 2016, 15% of easyfinancial loans went bad, a rate much higher than that of banks. The company operates with an omni-channel business model that allows customers to transact through their national branch network of over 240 locations, online or through one of their many retail and merchant partnerships.  Community involvement  Goeasy has been working with the Boys & Girls Clubs of Canada since 2004. In that time, Goeasy has organized national fundraising campaigns raising more than one million dollars for the organization. They continue to support the Boys and Girls Club. In 2014, goeasy launched easybites, with a $2.5 million donation and a commitment to build 100 safe and functioning kitchens in Boys & Girls Clubs across the country. easybites has grown into an annual fundraising campaign called ‚ÄúFeed the Future‚Äù which is well ahead of its 10-year goal of having donated 40 kitchens at the close of 2018. The easybites program makes it easier for Boys & Girls Clubs of Canada to offer nutritious meals and snacks to youth visiting the centers. Renovating the kitchen spaces also enables more locations to provide cooking and nutrition classes. Boys & Girls Clubs in Midland, Sarnia, Cranbrook, Cornwall, Yarmouth, Toronto, Ponoka, and Charlottetown have benefited from the easybites program. Goeasy branches often remain involved with their local Boys & Girls Clubs well after the new kitchens are installed.  Controversy  Easyhome has often been criticized for its high prices, often hidden through relatively small monthly payments spread over a long period. For instance, in 2012, a Hewlett Packard PC which could be bought outright for a few hundred dollars had a total cost of $2,000 at easyhome, spread out over three years. In 2015, the total cost of a 55-inch curved Samsung TV was estimated to be more than twice as much at easyhome than at a conventional electronics retailer. Easyfinancial has similarly been criticized for its high interest rates, with an average annual rate of around 50%. Many loans offered by easyfinancial are very close to the maximum rate of interest in Canada of 60%. In February 2015, CBC Marketplace, an investigative consumer advocacy TV series, ran an episode focusing on easyfinancial's business tactics. Beyond the high interest rates charged, easyfinancial was also criticized for deceptive and misleading business practices. For instance, easyfinancial generally includes insurance in its loans, but does not quote the cost of the insurance in the cost of the loan. The insurance often doubles the effective interest rate of the loan. Easyfinancial also does not make clear that the insurance is optional. Easyfinancial was also criticized for pushing its customers into \\"debt traps\\" by offering re-financing, often before the original loan is paid off. Often, the company did not clearly communicate to its customers the eventual cost of the loans it offered. In 2016, easyhome apologized for running a print flyer featuring an OMFG sale, because of the offensiveness of that acronym.

Rise to power  After the death of Abdul Kahrim Bey in 1750 Erdeni was made the Khan of Kokand after slaying Abdurakhman-Batir and all of his family in Kokand except his young son Narbuta who was visiting his grandmother. After another prolonged power struggle that lasted roughly ten months between 1752 and 1753 in which Bobobek seized power and held the title of Khan, Irdana took back the title of Khan and removed Bobobek from office.Bobobekov H.N., Qo ªqon tarixi, T., 1996. Policies as Khan Irdana Bey took active measures to expand the borders of the Khanate, briefly annexing the land of Ura-Tyube long coveted by the Khanate; Ura-Tyube ended up changing hands multiple times to and from Kokand throughout the 18th and 19th centuries. On his second attempt to annex Ura-Tyube he was more successful in capturing the territory, brutalizing prisoners of war by chopping off their heads and constructing a tower out of their heads. After various wars in attempts to expand the Khanate and Irdana's use of the title Khan instead of Bek, the Qing began to demand tribute from Kokand in the form of livestock and people; the Qing had informed the Khan of the Kazakh Middle Horde that they intended to take over Samarkand and most of Turkestan. When Irdana was informed of the plan of the Qing to take over most of Central Asia, he managed to unite the previously warring militaries of an Afghan monarch, several Kyrgz biys and well as those of Khujand, Ura-Tyube on the premise of saving the Islamic world from takeover.

Research Karthik Muralidharan's research focuses on education, health and social protection, the measurement of the quality of public service delivery, programme evaluation, and improvements to the effectiveness of public spending (especially in developing countries). In particular, Muralidharan has contributed to the research of public servant absenteeism in developing countries, with a focus on teachers and health workers, e.g. finding that on average ca. 19% of teachers and 35% of health workers were absent on a given work day in a sample of developing countries (Bangladesh, Ecuador, India, Indonesia, Peru and Uganda), and that among those present many weren't working.Chaudhury, N. et al. (2006). Missing in Action: Teacher and Health Worker Absence in Developing Countries. Journal of Economic Perspectives, 20(1), pp. 91-116. Focusing on teacher absenteeism in India, further findings include that higher pay isn't generally correlated with higher presence, presence decreases in age and rank, and that absenteeism cannot be explained by teachers being outsiders to the communities in which they are teaching (as comparable local teachers have similar absence rates); moreover, private school teachers are only slightly less likely to be absent than public school teachers unless there is local competition between private and public schools.Chaudhury, N. et al. (2005). Teacher absence in India: A Snapshot. Journal of the European Economic Association, 3(2-3), pp. 658-667. In another study on education, Muralidharan (together with Venkatesh Sundararaman) found that conditioning teacher pay on their performance for two years was effective in increasing students' performance in math and language tests by 0.27 and 0.17 standard deviations, respectively, in schools in Andhra Pradesh.Muralidharan, K., Sundararaman, V.

Thailand was the third-largest provider of ground forces to South Vietnam, following the Americans and South Koreans. Due to its proximity to Thailand, Vietnam's conflicts were closely monitored by Bangkok. Thai involvement did not become official until the total involvement of the United States in support of South Vietnam in 1963. The Thai government then allowed the United States Air Force in Thailand to use its air and naval bases. At the height of the war, almost 50,000 American military personnel were stationed in Thailand, mainly airmen. Seal of Royal Thai Army Expeditionary Division Black Panther Division colors come off USS Okanogan, Newport, 29 July 1968 The Thai Queen's Cobra battalion in Phuoc Tho Members of Black Panther Division, loaded onto 2 1/2 ton trucks, roll through the gate of the US Army Terminal at Newport Docks enroute to Bearcat, 22 July 1968 Thai soldiers wash in a small pool during a break in operations, Nhon Trac, 19 October 1967 Military Police stop traffic to allow the 2 1/2 ton trucks carrying members of the Black Panther Division to leave Newport Docks, enroute to Bearcat, 22 July 1968 Royal Thai Army troops in the field south of Bearcat unload supplies from a UH-1D helicopter from the 240th Helicopter Assault Company, 23 January 1971 Deployment of forces to South Vietnam On 29 September 1964 a 16-man Royal Thai Air Force (RTAF) contingent arrived in Vietnam to assist in flying and maintaining some of the cargo aircraft operated by the Republic of Vietnam Air Force (RVNAF). On 22 July 1966 a 21-man RTAF contingent qualified on the C-123 became operational and were attached to the United States Air Force (USAF) 315th Air Commando Wing, while 5 men remained with the RVNAF where they were assigned to fly C-47 aircraft. In October 1967 the Royal Thai Volunteer Regiment (Queen's Cobras) was sent to Camp Bearcat at Bien Hoa, to fight alongside the Americans, Australians, New Zealanders and South Vietnamese. In 1968 the Cobras were replaced by the Royal Thai Army Expeditionary Division (Black Panthers). About 40,000 Thai military would serve in South Vietnam, with 351 killed in action and 1,358 wounded. Thai morale was generally high, with Thai troops taking pride in their roles as \\"defenders of Thailand from communism\\" and as Buddhists. Thai forces were generally respected by their American allies and inflicted on their PAVN opponents several times the losses they took; Thai media would often report on the war in terms of enemy killed, similar to American media. One state newspaper during the war had the headline \\"In 150 Fights, 100 [Thais] Are Dead, 1,000 Viet Cong Are Killed.\\" The RTAF contingent achieved its greatest strength in late 1970. The total number of Thais serving with the Victory Flight, as their Vietnam transport operation was designated, had grown from to 45. 3 pilots and 5 flight engineers flew RVNAF C-47s with the 415th Squadron; 9 pilots, 7 flight engineers and 3 load masters were flying C-123Ks with the USAF 19th Tactical Airlift Squadron both located at Tan Son Nhut Air Base. The remaining members of the flight had jobs on the ground in intelligence, communications, flight engineering, loading and operations. In December 1969 the effects of the withdrawal of the Philippine Civic Action Group, Vietnam, and antiwar sentiment in the US were felt in Thailand as elsewhere. The United Slales had welcomed the decision of the Thai government to contribute troops to South Vietnam and was willing to compensate it by logistical support and payment of certain allowances to Thai forces for duty out of the country. These facts led to charges and countercharges regarding the expenditures of funds supporting the Thai division. On 19 December the Bangkok press reported that some twenty government party members of the Thai parliament had signed a letter to the prime minister urging the withdrawal of Thai troops from South Vietnam. The reasons given were that the situation in South Vietnam had improved as a result of the Vietnamization program and other aid as evidenced by U.S. cutbacks, and that difficult domestic economic and security problems existed in Thailand. No reference was made to the \\"mercenary\\" and \\"subsidy\\" charges of the previous few days. On 21 December Thai Foreign Minister Thanat Khoman told newsmen that he had considered the withdrawal of Thai troops \\"because the United States recently issued another announcement regarding further withdrawals.\\" He also stated that the subject had been discussed with South Vietnamese Foreign Minister Tran Chan Thanh, and had been under consideration for some time. Two days later there was an apparent reversal of policy. After a cabinet meeting aimed at developing a unified position, the deputy prime minister announced: \\"Thailand will not pull any of her fighting men out of South Vietnam... Thailand has never contemplated such a move... The operation of Thai troops in South Vietnam is considered more advantageous than withdrawing them. If we plan to withdraw, we would have to consult with GVN since we sent troops there in response to an appeal from them. It is true that several countries are withdrawing troops from South Vietnam but our case is different.\\" The subject of a Thai troop withdrawal came up again in March 1970. In a meeting with the U.S. Ambassador, the Thai Prime Minister indicated that in light of continued U.S. and allied reductions, there was considerable pressure from the Thai parliament to withdraw. He stated that \\"When the people feel very strongly about a situation, the government must do something to ease the situation.\\" Little occurred until the following November when the Thai government announced it was planning to withdraw its forces from South Vietnam by 1972. The decision was related to the deterioration of security in Laos and Cambodia and the growth of internal insurgency in Thailand, as well as the U.S. pullback. The withdrawal plans were based on a rotational phase-out. The fifth increment would not be replaced after its return to Thailand in August 1971. The sixth increment would deploy as planned in January 1971 and withdraw one year later to complete the redeployment. Thai Navy and Air Force units would withdraw sometime before January 1972. The composition of the remaining residual force would be taken up in Thai-South Vietnamese discussions held later. A token Thai force of a non-combatant nature was under consideration. The withdrawal plans were confirmed and even elaborated upon through a Royal Thai government announcement to the United States and South Vietnam on 26 March 1971. The Thais proposed that half of the Black Panther Division be withdrawn in July 1971, and the remaining half in February 1972; this plan was in line with their earlier proposals. The three LST's Landing Ship, Tank (LSTs) of the Sea Horse unit would be withdrawn in April 1972 and Victory Flight would be pulled out by increments during the period April-December 1971. After July 1971 the Headquarters, Royal Thai Forces, Vietnam, would be reduced to 204 men. It would remain at that strength until its withdrawal in April 1972, after which only a token force would remain. US use of Thai air bases The official American military presence in Thailand started in April 1961 when an advance party of the USAF 6010th Tactical (TAC) Group arrived at Don Muang Royal Thai Air Force Base at the request of the Thai government to establish an aircraft warning system at Don Muang. The USAF presence grew rapidly with the expansion of the Laotian Civil War and the Vietnam War. The USAF would eventually use 8 airbases in Thailand: Don Muang, Korat, Nakhon Phanom, Nam Phong, Takhli, Ubon, Udorn and U-Tapao. Over the course of the war, the United States poured $1.1 billion in economic and military aid into Thailand, while USAID poured in another $590 million, both aiding Thailand's economy and indirectly paying for the cost of Thailand's participation and then some. At the height of the war, some 50,000 American military personnel (mostly Air Force) were stationed throughout Thailand. Thai entrepreneurs built scores of new hotels, restaurants and bars to serve the waves of free- spending American G.I.s, causing foreign funding to flow into the country. At the war's end, Thailand kept all military equipment and infrastructure left by the Americans, aiding in the country's modernization. On 14 October 1973 following the 1973 Thai popular uprising, former Supreme Court Judge Sanya Dharmasakti, then chancellor and dean of the faculty of law at Thammasat University, was appointed prime minister by royal decree, replacing the succession of staunchly pro-American and anti-Communist military dictatorships that had ruled Thailand previously. With the fall of both Cambodia and South Vietnam in April 1975, the political climate between Washington and the government of PM Sanya had soured. Immediately after the news broke of the use of Thai bases to support the Mayaguez rescue, the Thai Government lodged a formal protest with the US and riots broke out outside the US Embassy in Bangkok. The Thai government wanted the US out of Thailand by the end of the year. The USAF implemented Palace Lightning, the plan to withdraw its aircraft and personnel from Thailand. The SAC units left in December 1975; and the 3rd Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Group left on 31 January 1976, however the base remained under US control until it was formally returned to the Thai government on 13 June 1976.

A registered trademark was granted by the USPTO on August 28, 2018. ChumpCar World Series, a budget class endurance racing organization known as ChumpCar International Inc., was founded in 2009. Chumpcar was a play on words named after the defunct Champ Car World Series. The initial concept was an endurance racing series for cars of $500 in value or less similar to the 24 Hours of LeMons endurance racing series. In 2015, ChumpCar Canada was split off as a separate entity, although there is still close coordination between the US ChampCar Endurance Series and the Canadian ChumpCar organization. ChumpCar World Series began referring to itself as ChampCar Endurance Series in November 2017.  Preparation and rules  To enter an event, competitors are required to select a vehicle from the Vehicle Performance Index list of cars located on the ChampCar website. Vehicles are listed with point values based on the stock vehicle's performance potential assigned to each model year. The table contains a large variety of makes and models to choose from. If the point value of the vehicle is less than 500, additional points may be spent on performance parts, as long as the total point calculation of vehicle plus performance parts does not exceed 500. This point calculation excludes required safety equipment, as well as maintenance and replacement of wear items with OEM or OEM-equivalent parts. No credit is given toward the point calculation of the vehicle for selling removed parts. Vehicles with a point calculation in excess of 500 are allowed to compete with penalty laps subtracted from their total. While the assessed vehicle point goal is 500, typical actual build costs can run anywhere from $4,000 to $10,000 to prep a car. Most of this budget is safety related such as brakes, roll cage, tires, racing seat, fire suppression system, and fuel cell. The races run for a fixed length of time. The team that completes the most laps net of penalty laps is the winner. The event organizers impose a complete set of safety rules that typically are on par with other road racing sanctioning bodies, including the Sports Car Club of America and National Auto Sport Association. Tires are restricted to a UTQG treadwear rating of 180 or greater. Prior to July 2013, this value was 190. The change was made to allow for additional options in tire selection.  Race format  Events are held at major road racing tracks across the US. The most common event format is a two-race weekend, with one eight-hour race each on Saturday and Sunday. However, a variety of other formats are used, with lengths ranging from 10 to 24-hours. Starts are picked by a random number generator utilizing the pit stall number. The order is reversed for the following days' race. Teams are scored and ranked by the number of laps completed during the time allotted for the race net of penalty laps. Teams are required to include at least two drivers (more for longer events). Each driver is required to complete at least one hour in the car. No stint is allowed to exceed two hours, with a minimum one hour rest. Pit stops where fuel is added to the car are required to be at least five minutes in length to ensure safe refueling.  Awards  The top three finishers on laps in each race are recognized with a trophy and a credit toward future participation in the series. Top finishing teams are awarded \\"Race Credits\\" for discounts to future races. Additional awards may be given for notably good (or bad) driving, especially dedicated repair work, or good overall spirit. Overall spirit is specially recognized by the Spirit of ChampCar Award, given to the team in the race that the organizers feel best exemplifies the competitive spirit of the series.  National Championship  An annual National Championship event will be held at a track designated by the CEO. Sonoma Raceway, located in Sonoma California was chosen for the 2020 TireRack.com ChampCar Endurance Series National Championship. The race will take place on February 15 and 16, 2020.

The record consists of 10 tracks, paying tribute to the legacies of Thelonious Monk, Bill Evans, Jim Hall, and Astor Piazzolla. Eight compositions were written by bandmembers. Reception Charley Raiff of Elmore Magazine wrote \\"Gary Burton, the pioneer of the four-mallet vibraphone technique, again exhibits his unfaltering vision of what playing that instrument should be in his newest release... Guided Tour serves as a magnificent follow-up to 2011‚Äôs Common Ground, and the pairing of Burton‚Äôs vibraphone and Lage‚Äôs guitar works better than ever. Despite his age, Burton seems to be just warming up.\\" Thom Jurek of Allmusic stated \\"On its sophomore offering for Mack Avenue Records, the New Gary Burton Quartet reveals the musical maturity that naturally occurs when a disparate but extremely gifted group of players locks in as a band... While Guided Tour proves that this band has hit its stride and fires exquisitely on all cylinders, it also reveals, that at age 70, Burton's fire for pushing his creative edge as a bandleader, and as a soloist, still burns brightly.\\" Dave Gelly of The Guardian noted \\"It's one thing to be a virtuoso player, which he is, but quite another to create a whole sonic world with just four musicians. That's what Burton has been doing consistently for more than 45 years and, as this second album by his newest quartet proves, the sounds just go on getting richer. Every one of these 10 pieces is filled with tonal light and shade, harmonic sparkle and rhythmic subtlety.\\" Track listingPersonnel Band * Gary Burton ‚Äì vibraphone, producer * Scott Colley ‚Äì bass * Antonio Sanchez ‚Äì drums * Julian Lage ‚Äì guitar Production * Mark Wilder ‚Äì mastering * Gretchen C.

She showed considerable promise as a two-year-old when she won three times and finished twice on two occasions. In the following year he won the Epsom Oaks and the Park Hill Stakes as well as finishing second in the Yorkshire Oaks. Her form declined thereafter and she failed to win again before being retired at the end of the following year. She produced only four known foals, but these did include the St Leger winner Firdaussi. Background Brownhylda was a \\"big, well-made, but rather plain\\" bay mare bred in the United Kingdom by F W Dunn. As a yearling in the autumn of 1921 the filly was offered for sale at Doncaster and bought for 310 guineas by Richard \\"Dick\\" Dawson on behalf of the Vicomte de Fontarce. She was sent into training with Dawson at Whatcombe near Wantage in Berkshire. She was sired by Lord Derby Stedfast, a top-class performer whose wins included the Champion Stakes, Coronation Cup, Sussex Stakes, Prince of Wales's Stakes and St James's Palace Stakes. Her dam Valkyrie, was distantly descended from the influential broodmare Preserve. Racing career=1922: two-year-old season= As a two-year-old, Brownhylda won three of her seven races namely the Prince of Wales's Nursery at Doncaster, the Autumn Foal Stakes and the November Nursery at Newbury. She also finished second to the Coventry Stakes winner Drake in the Hurstbourne Stakes in July, and to the colt Twelve Pointer in the International Two-year-old Stakes at Kempton Park Racecourse. =1923: three- year-old season= In April 1923, Brownhylda finished unplaced behind Lord Derby's filly Tranquil in the Berkshire Handicap at Newbury. On 8 of June Brownhylda started at odds of 10/1 in a twelve-runner field for the 145th running of the Oaks Stakes over one and a half miles at Epsom Racecourse. The overwhelming favourite for the race was Tranquil, who had won the 1,000 Guineas over one mile at Newmarket. Ridden by Vic Smyth, Brownhylda tracked the leader before going to the front a furlong out and won in a closely contested finish, beating Shrove by a neck with the Aga Khan's Teresina a head away in third. Tranquil finished fourth having been unable to obtain a clear run in the straight. The filly's winning time of 2:37.0 was a second faster than the one recorded by Papyrus in winning the Derby two days earlier. In August Brownhylda contested the Yorkshire Oaks at York Racecourse and finished second to Lord Astor's filly Splendid Jay. In September the filly was moved up in distance for the Park Hill Stakes at Doncaster. With Smyth again in the saddle she started favourite and won from Concertina. In autumn she finished second to the Queen's Vase winner Puttenden in the Lowther Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse, and ran unplaced in the Liverpool Autumn Cup. At the end of the year Brownhylda was put up for auction at Newmarket but failed to meet her reserve price when the bidding stopped at 5,500 guineas. The Sporting Chronicle commented that she looked \\"leggy\\" and unimpressive in the sales- ring. =1924: four-year-old season= Brownhylda remained in training as a four-year-old but made little impact on the track. She finished unplaced the City and Suburban Handicap at Epsom in April and the Jubilee Handicap at Kempton in May. In the following month she slipped and fell approaching the final turn in the Ascot Stakes. Towards the end of the season she finished unplaced under a weight of 116 pounds in the Newbury Autumn Cup. At the end of the year, Brownhylda returned to the sales-ring at Newmarket and was bought for 5,100 guineas by representatives of the Aga Khan. Assessment and honours In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Brownhylda an \\"inferior\\" winner of the Oaks. Breeding record At the end of her racing career Brownhylda became a broodmare for the Aga Khan's stud. She produced at least four foals and one notable winner: *Witch's Cauldron, a chestnut filly, foaled in 1926, sired by Pot Au Feu. Dam of Longthanh (Poule d'Essai des Pouliches) *The Phanar, colt, 1927 *Far And Sure, brown colt, 1928, by Phalaris *Firdaussi, chestnut colt, 1929, by Pharos. Won St Leger.

A longtime political and legal associate of college classmate William H. Seward, Blatchford is most notable for his service in the New York State Assembly and as U.S. Minister to the State of the Church. He was also the father of Samuel Blatchford, who served as an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Early life Blatchford was born in Stratford, Connecticut on April 23, 1798. He was the ninth of seventeen children born to Reverend Samuel Blatchford and Alicia (n√©e Windeatt) Blatchford. Blatchford's grandnephew, also named Richard M. Blatchford, was a career officer in the United States Army. He attained the rank of major general, and was a veteran of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War and World War I. He was educated in Connecticut and Lansingburgh, New York, and graduated from Union College in 1815. Blatchford maintained his association with Union College for the rest of his life. He was a member of the college's board of trustees, and received the honorary degree of LL.D. in 1864. He also served as a member of the board of visitors that oversaw management of the Knott Trust Fund, which college president Eliphalet Nott left for the school's benefit. In addition, Blatchford endowed Union College's Blatchford Oratorical Prizes, medals which were presented by faculty judges to the top student competitors at an annual speech making competition. Career He taught school in Jamaica, Queens while studying law, and attained admission to the bar in 1820. Pencil sketch of Blatchford Blatchford practiced law in Manhattan and Auburn, New York with fellow Union College student William H. Seward and other partners, and became a highly skilled corporation and banking attorney as one of the founders of the firm now known as Cravath, Swaine & Moore. In 1826 he was appointed U.S. counsel and agent for the Bank of England, and he served in the same capacity for the Second Bank of the United States. When the charter for the Bank of the United States expired in 1836, Blatchford was responsible for concluding all pending business and resolving all remaining obligations between the two institutions. Blatchford was also a successful investor and businessman, and his holdings included New York City real estate, as well as land development ventures as far away as Florida. He also owned shares of stock in several companies, and by 1845, his net worth was over $200,000 (). He was a longtime friend of Daniel Webster, and was one of the executors of Webster's will. Blatchford served on the boards of directors of several New York railroads that were subsequently consolidated to form the New York Central, including the Saratoga and Whitehall. After the mergers, he was appointed as a vice president and director of the consolidated company. In addition, he was a director of other corporations, including the North American Fire Insurance Company. A Whig Party activist, Blatchford was affiliated with Seward in politics and was elected to the New York State Assembly in 1855. He served one term (the 78th session), and was chosen to act as Speaker pro tempore during the absence of Speaker DeWitt Clinton Littlejohn. Blatchford was also a trustee of Bellevue Hospital Medical College. =Public service= In 1859, Blatchford was appointed to the commission which oversaw creation and operation of New York City's Central Park, and he served until the implementation of a new city charter reorganized the municipal government in 1870; from 1860 to 1863 he was the commission's president. In 1872, he was appointed to the city parks commission, and he served until failing health caused him to resign in 1873. Blatchford became a Republican when the party was founded in the mid-1850s. Because Congress was not in session at the start of the American Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln named Blatchford, John Adams Dix, and George Opdyke as commissioners of the Union Defense Committee, responsible to expend federal funds on presidential authority for the initial raising and equipping of troops that were mustered into the Union Army. In August 1862, during the Lincoln Administration, Blatchford was appointed U.S. Minister to the State of the Church in Rome, succeeding Alexander Randall. He served until October 1863, and was succeeded by Rufus King. Blatchford continued to practice law until ill health caused him to retire in the early 1870s. Personal life In 1819, Blatchford married Julia Ann Mumford (1798‚Äì1857) of Schenectady, New York and New York City. Before his wife's death in 1857, Blatchford was the father of five children: * Samuel Blatchford (1820‚Äì1893), who served as a Justice of the United States Supreme Court from 1882 to 1893. * Mary Milford Blatchford (1823‚Äì1852), the wife of Burr Wakeman Griswold (1824‚Äì1886). * Julia Alicia Blatchford (1830‚Äì1831), who died young. * Julia Maria Blatchford (1834‚Äì1922), who married architect Edward Tuckerman Potter (1831‚Äì1904), a son of Bishop Alonzo Potter. * Sophia Ethelinda Blatchford (1836‚Äì1908) In 1860, Blatchford married Angelica Hamilton (1819‚Äì1868). Angelica was the daughter of James Alexander Hamilton and granddaughter of Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton and Alexander Hamilton, the first Treasury Secretary. Angelica Hamilton died in 1868, and on January 18, 1870 Blatchford married Katherine Hone, the daughter of Philip Hone, a former New York City mayor. Blatchford was robbed in an 1871 incident that made national headlines and was covered in the news again following his death. According to published accounts, he stopped at a fruit stand and set down a package so he could reach into his pocket for money to complete a purchase. As he did so, a thief tapped him on the shoulder; when Blatchford turned around, the thief or a confederate picked up the package and made an unnoticed getaway. The package contained $50,000 in negotiable securities (). The thief or thieves were never caught, and the securities were never recovered. Blatchford died at his summer home in Newport, Rhode Island on September 4, 1875, and was buried at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, Section 100, Lot 5643.

A zettabyte is a multiple of the unit byte that measures digital storage, and it is equivalent to 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 [1021] bytes. According to Cisco Systems, an American multinational technology conglomerate, the global IP traffic achieved an estimated 1.2 zettabytes (or an average of 96 exabytes (EB) per month) in 2016. Global IP traffic refers to all digital data that passes over an IP network which includes, but is not limited to, the public Internet. The largest contributing factor to the growth of IP traffic comes from video traffic (including online streaming services like Netflix and YouTube). The Zettabyte Era can also be understood as an age of growth of all forms of digital data that exist in the world which includes the public Internet, but also all other forms of digital data such as stored data from security cameras or voice data from cell-phone calls. Taking into account this second definition of the Zettabyte Era, it was estimated that in 2012 upwards of 1 zettabyte of data existed in the world and that by 2020 there would be more than 40 zettabytes of data in the world at large. The Zettabyte Era translates to difficulties for data centers to keep up with the explosion of data consumption, creation and replication. In 2015, 2% of total global power was taken up by the Internet and all its components, so energy efficiency with regards to data centers has become a central problem in the Zettabyte Era.  The zettabyte  A zettabyte is a digital unit of measurement. One zettabyte is equal to one sextillion bytes or 1021 (1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000) bytes or, one zettabyte is equal to a trillion gigabytes. To put this into perspective, consider that \\"if each terabyte in a zettabyte were a kilometre, it would be equivalent to 1,300 round trips to the moon and back (768,800 kilometers)\\". Or, as former Google CEO Eric Schmidt puts it, from the very beginning of humanity to the year 2003, an estimated 5 exabytes of information was created, which corresponds to the 0.5% of a zettabyte only. In 2013 that amount of information (5 exabytes) took only two days to create and that pace is continuously growing.  Definitions  The concept of the Zettabyte Era can be separated into two distinct categories: # In terms of IP traffic: This first definition refers to the total amount of data to traverse global IP networks such as the public Internet. In Canada for example, there has been an average growth of 50.4% of data downloaded by residential Internet subscribers from 2011 to 2016. According to this definition, the Zettabyte Era began in 2016 when global IP traffic surpassed one zettabyte, estimated to have reached roughly 1.2 zettabytes. # In terms of all forms of digital data: In this second definition, the Zettabyte Era refers to the total amount of all the digital data that exists in any form, from digital films to transponders that record highway usage to SMS text messages. According to this definition, the Zettabyte Era began in 2012, when the amount of digital data in the world surpassed that of one zettabyte.  Cisco reportThe Zettabyte Era: Trends and Analysis  In 2016, Cisco Systems stated that the Zettabyte Era was now reality when global IP traffic reached an estimated 1.2 zettabytes. Cisco also provided future predictions of global IP traffic in their report The Zettabyte Era: Trends and Analysis. This report uses current and past global IP traffic statistics to forecast future trends. The report predicts trends between 2016 and 2021. Here are some of the predictions for 2021 found in the report: * Global IP traffic will triple and is estimated to reach 3.3 ZB on a yearly basis * In 2016 video traffic (e.g. Netflix and YouTube) accounted for 73% of total traffic. In 2021 this will increase to 82% * The number of devices connected to IP networks will be more than three times the global population * The amount of time it would take for one person to watch the entirety of video that will traverse global IP networks in one month is 5 million years * PC traffic will be exceeded by smartphone traffic. PC traffic will account for 25% of total IP traffic while smartphone traffic will be 33% * There will be a twofold increase in broadband speeds  Factors that led to the Zettabyte Era  There are many factors that brought about the rise of the Zettabyte Era. Increases in video streaming, mobile phone usage, broadband speeds and data center storage are all contributing factors that led to the rise (and continuation) of data consumption, creation and replication. = Increased video streaming = There is a large, and ever-growing consumption of multimedia, including video streaming, on the Internet that has contributed to the rise of the Zettabyte Era. In 2011 it was estimated that roughly 25‚Äì40% of IP traffic was taken up by video streaming services. Since then, video IP traffic has nearly doubled to an estimated 73% of total IP traffic. Furthermore, Cisco has predicted that this trend will continue into the future, estimating that by 2021, 82% of total IP traffic will come from video traffic. The amount of data used by video streaming services depends on the quality of the video. Thus, Android Central breaks down how much data is used (on a smartphone) with regards to different video resolutions. According to their findings, per hour video between 240p and 320p resolution uses roughly 0.3GB. Standard video, which is clocked in at a resolution of 480p, uses approximately 0.7GB per hour. Netflix and YouTube are at the top of the list in terms of the most globally streamed video services online. In 2016, Netflix represented 32.72% of all video streaming IP traffic, while YouTube represented 17.31%. The third spot is taken up by Amazon Prime Video where global data usage comes in at 4.14%.  Netflix  Currently, Netflix is the largest video streaming service in the world, accessible in over 200 countries and with more than 80 million subscribers. Streaming high definition video content through Netflix uses roughly 3 GB of data per hour, while standard definition takes up around 1 GB of data per hour. In North America, during peak bandwidth consumption hours (around 8 PM) Netflix uses about 40% of total network bandwidth. The vast amount of data marks an unparalleled period in time and is one of the major contributing factors that has led the world into the Zettabyte Era.  YouTube  YouTube is another large video streaming (and video uploading) service, whose data consumption rate across both fixed and mobile networks remains quite large. In 2016, the service was responsible for using up about 20% of total Internet traffic and 40% of mobile traffic. In 2016, 100 hours of video content on YouTube was uploaded every 60 seconds. YouTube not only offers content for download (through streaming) but also As of 2018, 300 hours of YouTube video content is uploaded every minute. = Increased wireless and mobile traffic = The usage of mobile technologies to access IP networks has resulted in an increase in overall IP traffic in the Zettabyte Era. In 2016, the majority of devices that moved IP traffic and other data streams were hard-wired devices. Since then, wireless and mobile traffic have increased and are predicted to continue to increase rapidly. Cisco predicts that by the year 2021, wired devices will account for 37% of total traffic while the remaining 63% will be accounted for through wireless and mobile devices. Furthermore, smartphone traffic is expected to surpass PC traffic by 2021; PCs are predicted to account for 25% of total traffic, down from 46% in 2016, whereas smartphone traffic is expected to increase from 13% to 33%. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), mobile broadband penetration rates are ever-growing. Between June 2016 and December 2016 there was an average mobile broadband penetration rate increase of 4.43% of all OECD countries. Poland had the largest increase coming in at 21.55% while Latvia had the lowest penetration rate having declined 5.71%. The OECD calculated that there were 1.27 billion total mobile broadband subscriptions in 2016, 1.14 billion of these subscriptions had both voice and data included in the plan. = Increased broadband speeds = Broadband is what connects Internet users to the Internet, thus the speed of the broadband connection is directly correlated to IP traffic ‚Äì the greater the broadband speed, the greater the possibility of more traffic that can traverse IP networks. Cisco estimates that broadband speeds are expected to double by 2021. In 2016, global average fixed broadband reached speeds as high as 27.5 Mbit/s but are expected to reach 53 Mbit/s by 2021. Between the fourth quarter of 2016 and the first quarter of 2017, average fixed broadband speeds globally equated to 7.2 Mbit/s. South Korea was at the top of the list in terms of broadband speeds. In that period broadband speeds increased 9.3%. High-bandwidth applications need significantly higher broadband-speeds. Certain broadband technologies including Fiber-to-the-home (FTTH), high-speed digital subscriber line (DSL) and cable broadband are paving the way for increased broadband speeds. FTTH can offer broadband-speeds that are ten times (or even a hundred times) faster than DSL or cable.  Internet service providers in the Zettabyte Era  The Zettabyte Era has affected Internet service providers (ISPs) with the growth of data flowing from all directions. Congestion occurs when there is too much data flowing in and the quality of service (QoS) weakens. In both China and the U.S. some ISPs store and handle exabytes of data. The response by certain ISPs is to implement so-called network management practices in an attempt to accommodate the never-ending data-surge of Internet subscribers on their networks. Furthermore, the technologies being implemented by ISPs across their networks are evolving to address the increase in data flow. Network management practices have brought about debates relating to net neutrality in terms of fair access to all content on the Internet. According to The European Consumer Organisation, network neutrality can be understood as an aim that \\"all Internet should be treated equally, without discrimination or interference. When this is the case, users enjoy the freedom to access the content, services, and applications of their choice, using any device they choose\\". According to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) Telecom Regulatory Policy 2009-657 there are two forms of Internet network management practices in Canada. The first are economic practices such as data caps, the second are technical practices like bandwidth throttling and blocking. According to the CRTC, the technical practices are put in place by ISPs to address and solve congestion issues in their network, however the CRTC states that ISPs are not to employ ITMPs for preferential or unjustly discriminatory reasons. In the United States, however, during the Obama-era administration, under the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) 15‚Äì24 policy, there were three bright-line rules in place to protect net neutrality: no blocking, no throttling, no paid prioritization. On 14 December 2017, the FCC voted 3‚Äì2 to remove these rules, allowing ISPs to block, throttle and give fast-lane access to content on their network. In an attempt to aid ISP's in dealing with large data-flow in the Zettabyte Era, in 2008 Cisco unveiled a new router, the Aggregation Services Router (ASR) 9000, which at the time was supposed to be able to offer six times the speed of comparable routers. In one second the ASR 9000 router would, in theory, be able to process and distribute 1.2 million hours of DVD traffic. In 2011, with the coming of the Zettabyte Era, Cisco had continued work on the ASR 9000 in that it would now be able to handle 96 terabytes a second, up significantly from 6.4 terabytes a second the ASR 9000 could handle in 2008.  Data centers = Energy consumption = Data centers attempt to accommodate the ever-growing rate at which data is produced, distributed, and stored. Data centers are large facilities used by enterprises to store immense datasets on servers. In 2014 it was estimated that in the U.S. alone there were roughly 3 million data centers, ranging from small centers located in office buildings to large complexes of their own. Increasingly, data centers are storing more data than end-user devices. By 2020 it is predicted that 61% of total data will be stored via cloud applications (data centers) in contrast to 2010 when 62% of data storage was on end-user devices. An increase in data centers for data storage coincides with an increase in energy consumption by data centers. In 2014, data centers in the U.S. accounted for roughly 1.8% of total electricity consumption which equates to 70 billion kWh. Between 2010‚Äì2014 an increase of 4% was attributed to electricity consumption by data centers, this upward trend of 4% is predicted to continue through 2014‚Äì2020. In 2011, energy consumption from all data centers equated to roughly 1.1 to 1.5% of total global energy consumption. Information and communication technologies, including data centers, are responsible for creating large quantities of emissions. It is estimated that by 2020 they will account for 12% of total global emissions.  Google‚Äôs green initiatives  The energy used by data centers is not only to power their servers. In fact, most data centers use about half of their energy costs on non-computing energy such as cooling and power conversion. Google's data centers have been able to reduce non-computing costs to 12%. Furthermore, as of 2016, Google uses its artificial intelligence unit, DeepMind, to manage the amount of electricity used for cooling their data centers, which results in a cost reduction of roughly 40% after the implementation of DeepMind. Google claims that its data centers use 50% less energy than ordinary data centers. According to Google's Senior Vice President of Technical Infrastructure, Urs H√∂lzle, Google's data centers (as well as their offices) will have reached 100% renewable energy for their global operations by the end of 2017. Google plans to accomplish this milestone by buying enough wind and solar electricity to account for all the electricity their operations consume globally. The reason for these green-initiatives is to address climate change and Google's carbon footprint. Furthermore, these green-initiatives have become cheaper, with the cost of wind energy lowering by 60% and solar energy coming down 80%. In order to improve a data center's energy efficiency, reduce costs and lower the impact on the environment, Google provides 5 of the best practices for data centers to implement: # Measure the Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE), a ratio used by the industry to measure the energy used for non-computing functions, to track a data center's energy use. # Using well-designed containment methods, try to stop cold and hot air from mixing. Also, use backing plates for empty spots on the rack and eliminate hot spots. # Keep the aisle temperatures cold for energy savings. # Use free cooling methods to cool data centers, including a large thermal reservoir or evaporating water. # Eliminate as many power conversion steps as possible to lower power distribution losses.  The Open Compute Project  In 2010, Facebook launched a new data center designed in such a way that allowed it to be 38% more efficient and 24% less expensive to build and run than the average data center. This development led to the formation of the Open Compute Project (OCP) in 2011. The OCP members collaborate in order to build new technological hardware that is more efficient, economical and sustainable in an age where data is ever-growing. The OCP is currently working on several projects, including one specifically focusing on data centers. This project aims to guide the way in which new data centers are built, but also to aid already existing data centers in improving thermal and electrical energy as well as to maximize mechanical performance. The OCP's data center project focuses on five areas: facility power, facility operations, layout and design, facility cooling and facility monitoring and control.

He is known for a mission to the Tuaregs he undertook in 1862. Life Hippolyte Etienne Alphonse Mircher was born on 13 August 1820 in Strasbourg, Alsace. His parents were Guillaume Mircher (1785‚Äì1853) and Catherine Victoire Devaux (1791‚Äì1852). His father had been a junior officer in the Napoleonic armies and had little money. Hippolyte Mircher volunteered for the army at the age of 18 and was made a sergeant. He passed the competition at the √âcole sp√©ciale militaire de Saint-Cyr. He attended the staff college and graduated in 1842 first in his class out of 241 students. He was named Lieutenant in 1845 and Captain in 1847. He was posted to Algeria in 1852 and assigned to the governor general. He worked in the topographic office and studied the Arabic civilization and language. He had a daughter, Marie No√´lie, born in 1854 to Marguerite Victorine Gady (1828‚Äì1868). They married in Cairo on 3 January 1858. During the Crimean War (1853‚Äì56) Mircher spent a few months with the Army of the East in the political and topographical service, starting in April 1854. He helped prepare for the march of the armies from Gallipoli to Adrianople and Varna, then to the Crimea. Mircher distinguished himself at the Battle of Alma (20 September 1854). He was made a Knight of the Legion of Honor after the Battle of Inkerman (5 November 1854). He served in Kinburn when that city was occupied by the French. After the Crimean War Mircher was employed in Transcaucasia and Armenia to work on mapping the border between the Russian and Turkish empires. He was awarded the Turkish Order of the Medjidie. He returned to Paris, where he wrote a report on Anatolia. Mircher returned to Algeria and served in the topographical brigade and in an expedition as aide-de-camp of General √âdouard- Jean-√âtienne Deligny. He was then promoted to Chef d'Escadrons (Squadron Leader). He served on the staff of General Edmond-Charles de Martimprey(fr) during the Italian campaign. He returned to Algeria and served in the campaign against the Beni Snassem. As a distinguished Arabist he was charged with a mission to the Bey of Tunis. In 1862 he was assigned to arrange a commercial treaty with the Tuareg people. He undertook this mission between September and December 1862, travelling from Tripoli to Ghadames and then returning to Philippeville in Algeria. In 1863 Mircher was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel. His report on the mission to the Tuaregs, co-authored with his companion Ludovic de Polignac, was published in 1863. Mircher was head of the military mission in Egypt from 7 May 1864 to 17 August 1870 during construction of the Suez Canal. He led a team of advisers to Isma'il Pasha, who was to pay their salaries but was to consult with the consul-general Maxime Outrey on their assignments. This led to repeated difficulties between Ismail and the French authorities. In 1866 Mircher was promoted to Colonel. On 20 January 1870 in Nancy, Lorraine, he married Marguerite de Mercy (1840‚Äì1894). They had three children. Mircher was chief of staff of an infantry division in the 12th army corps during the Franco-Prussian War and fought in the Battle of Sedan (1‚Äì2 September 1870). He was taken prisoner at Sedan and held captive in Dresden. The letters that he wrote to his daughter Marie No√´lie from Dresden between September 1870 and March 1871 have been preserved. After being released, he served as first aide-de-camp and chief of staff to the governor general of Algeria from 2 April 1871 to 4 July 1873. He gave advice to the future explorer of French Africa Paul Soleillet, who was introduced to him by Auguste Warnier, the Deputy for Algeria. In 1873 he was named Chief of Staff of the 12th army corps. He retired as a Bridadier General in command of an infantry brigade in 1875. He died on 15 December 1878.

Two Indian soldiers including a JCO Subedar Bharnam Singh were killed by an avalanche during the operation. The operation was carried out by the 14th battalion of the Sikh Regiment. The peak is of strategic importance because it enables the Indian Army to tactically control 12 square kilometres of Pakistani territory in Karubar bowl. Domination of this area also threatened the Pakistani posts opposite Turtok Sector from the rear. Some analysts see it as an Indian retaliation for the capture of Point 5353 on the LoC by Pakistani troops.  References  Further reading  * Lt Gen H. S.

The FLBOA is created in Florida Statutes Chapter 473 and is administered by the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation (DBPR). Florida Statutes Chapter 473 permits the FLBOA to establish rules that are codified in the Florida Administrative Code (FAC) in sections 61H1-19 through 61H1-39.  Composition  The FLBOA members are appointed by the Governor of the State of Florida and confirmed by the Florida Senate. There are nine members, seven are licensed CPAs and two are public members who are not and have never been a CPA.  Roles  The FLBOA has three main functions: * Administering applications to sit for the CPA Examination and applications for licensure * Disciplining licensees * Approving rules in the FAC and changes to the FAC * All current and past members of the FLBOA are members of the National Association of State Boards of Accountancy (NASBA).  Licensing  The Florida Board of Accountancy handles applications to sit for the Uniform CPA Examination. The requirements to take the Uniform CPA Examination include: * Completion of 120 semester hours of college credit, including 24 semester credit hours of upper division accounting courses, * Complete a form disclosing: 1) whether you have a criminal record, 2) whether any judgement or open investigation relating to accounting, 3) whether you have ever had a professional license application denied, 3) whether you have ever had a professional license disciplined, and 5) whether you have ever been denied the right to sit for the CPA Examination. The Florida Board of Accountancy also handles applications for licenses for individual license to practice public accounting. The requirements for individual licensure include: * Pass the Uniform Accountancy Examination, * Completion 150 semester hours of college credit from an accredited university, with certain specific required courses including 30 semester hours in upper division accounting courses and 36 semester hours in upper division general business courses, and * Completion of the equivalent of one year of work. The Florida Board of Accountancy also handles applications for firm licenses. Firms are required to have a Firm license if they * Have an office in Florida that conducts audits, or * Have a name that includes CPA or a similar designation. Firms without an office in Florida may practice in Florida without a license, if * It is enrolled in Peer Review, and * Meets Firm structure requirements.  Discipline  Florida's disciplinary system is complaint based. All complaints are administered on a confidential basis. Complaints are presented to a Probable Cause Panel to determine if there is probable cause that there is a violation of Florida Statutes or Administrative Code. If no probable cause is not found or if the Probable Cause Panel issues a letter of guidance in lieu of a finding of probable cause, the matter is closed and remains a confidential issue. If probable cause is found, the matter is made public and brought before the Board at a Public Meeting. Discipline is considered and if approved is evidenced through a Final Order.  Rulemaking  The Florida Board of Accountancy is authorized by Florida Statutes Chapter 455 Professions and Chapter 473 Public Accountancy. These laws establish authority to create the Board of Accountancy and create, amend and repeal administrative rules. The Administrative Rules are contained in the Florida Administrative Code, Chapter 61H1-19 thru 39. The provisions of these rules may be temporarily or permanently waived by a majority vote of the Board. Affected persons, or licensees, may request the Board of Accountancy make a \\"Declaratory Statement\\" interpreting how the Board will rule on a matter in advance. The licensee must provide specific facts and circumstances and the Declaratory Statement only applies to those specific facts and circumstances. The most recent Declaratory Statement covered accounting and tax services provided to companies in the marijuana industry. On January 31, 2019, Governor Ron DeSantis convened a \\"Deregathon\\" for Florida Regulatory Boards. Also attending were Lieutenant Governor Jeanette Nu√±ez and DBPR Secretary Halsey Beshears. The purpose of the Deregathon was to begin the process of reducing unnecessary regulations facing Floridians with a goal to strengthen the state‚Äôs economy. The Florida Board of Accountancy participated in the event and identified several issues impacting Statutes, Administrative Rule and policy. With a regularly scheduled Board meeting the following day, the BOA began rulemaking on issues identified in the Deregathon.  History  Florida Governor Napoleon B. Broward signed the Florida Accountancy Act in 1905, beginning the regulation of the public accounting profession in 1905. The Act began both the regulation of CPA's and the regulation of unlicensed activity in Florida. In 1927, Florida prohibited the use of \\"public accountant\\" by nonlicensees. In 1937, the Board used that power to prohibit the use of \\"public accountant\\" in the case Abess v. Heller. The courts granted the injunction and Heller appealed leading to the Florida Supreme Court decision in 1938 upholding the ability to license unregulated activity. The Florida Supreme Court narrowed the ability of the Board of Accountancy to limit unlicensed activity in the 1957 case Florida Accountants Association v. Dandelake. The court ruled that unlicensed activity could only be limited if the accountant used the title CPA or PA or if the public was confused in the title of a CPA and a non-CPA. The Accountancy Act was changed in 1969 to remove the restriction of non-CPAs practicing public accounting, recognizing that many accounting activities could be performed by non CPAs so long as the public was not confused. National Firms Enter Florida The movement towards national and international enterprises who relied on larger CPA firms and more national and international CPA firms led to problems in Florida. The Florida regulations required that all partners and CPAs be licensed in Florida. Other than three firms grandfathered in before the licensing requirements, CPA firms would need to obtain a temporary license for each engagement because even one partner in another state who did not have a Florida CPA license could prevent a Firm from being licensed in Florida. Two cases heard by the Florida Supreme Court, Mercer v. Hemmings (1964 and 1966), limited the ability of the State to restrict national firms from practicing in Florida. The election in 1967 of Florida Governor Claude Kirk, the first Republican governor since reconstruction, a progrowth governor resulted in the appointment of Board of Accountancy members who favored allowing national firms to practice in Florida. R. Bob Smith, on behalf of the national firms, led an effort to separate the Board of Accountancy (a Florida Regulatory body) and the Florida Institute of Certified Public Accountants (a membership organization representing the CPA profession). In 1967, Clifford Beasely was the executive director of both entities. Mr. Beasley remained the FICPA Executive Director and Douglas Thompson, an auditor with the Auditor General of the State of Florida, became the Executive Director of the Board of Accountancy. In 1969, the Accountancy Act was amended to permit national firms to practice public accounting in Florida. The last impediment to national firms practicing public accounting in Florida was the requirement that all partners be CPAs, limiting the ability for firms with Tax and Consulting partners who were not licensed CPAs. in 1997, the Board of Accountancy Act was amended to require only a majority of partners be licensed CPAs. Continuing Professional Education In 1969, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants recommended mandatory Continuing Professional Education (CPE) to improve quality in the profession. Following this movement, in 1973 Florida enacted a law requiring 90 hours of Continuing Professional Education every three years. Statutory changes over the next 30 years led to the current law passed in 2004 requiring 80 hours of Continuing Professional Education every two years. In 2009, Chapter 473 was amended to require 4 CPE hours in Ethics replacing of a previous requirement for licensees to take and pass a laws and rules examination. In 2019, the Florida enacted legislation reducing the required Accounting and Auditing from 20 hours to 8 hours every two years. Increasing College Credit from 120 hours to 150 hours Also in 1969, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants recommended additional education beyond the bachelor's degree as a requirement for licensure. Over the next ten years, Florida discussed increasing the number of college credits required for licensure. In 1979, the State of Florida enacted the 150 hour requirement, becoming only the second state to enact such requirement. The requirement was phased in beginning in 1984. Ultimately, all 50 states would follow and the 150 hour requirement of college credit is now the standard for the profession in the United States. Advertising by CPAs During the 1990s, Florida was a party in two US Supreme Court cases shaped the way the CPA profession was regulated. * The first case began in 1991 when a CPA and attorney, Syvia Ibanez, advertised that she had a law firm that did tax and estate planning. While she was a licensed CPA, the law firm was not licensed and her advertisement included reference to another certification by an entity not recognized by the Board. The Board disciplined Ibanez for \\"false, deceptive, and misleading\\" advertising and the lower court upheld the discipline in 1993. In 1994, in Ibanez v. Florida Board of Accountancy the US Supreme Court overturned the lower court's decision and struck down the restrictions on \\"certified\\" unless they were in fact misleading. * The second case began in 1994 with Stephen Miller who was at the time working for American Express Tax and Business Services. American Express Tax and Business Services was not a licensed firm and advertised that Miller was a CPA. Florida regulations prohibited a non licensed firm from advertising that included reference to a CPA. Miller and American Express Tax and Business Services were disciplined by the Board of Accountancy. The lower courts overturned the discipline and the US Supreme Court agreed to hear the case in 1997 in a case titled Stephen Miller, American Express Tax and Business Services v. George Stuart, Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation, et al. The case centered around whether a CPA and a nonlicensed firm they worked for could advertise that they were licensed CPA. The US Supreme Court let stand the lower court ruling that Miller and American Express could advertise that Miller was a CPA even though American Express was not a licensed firm on the grounds that restricting truthful statements was a violation of the First Amendment's Freedom of Speech. In response, Florida changed its Accountancy Act to restrict what CPAs may do and not restricting how and under what circumstances they call themselves CPAs. Peer Review Peer Review began as a concept in the 1960s as a way of self-regulation of the CPA profession, where peer CPA's would review the CPA practice of another CPA and conclude on whether CPA was following standards. in 1972, the American Institute began a program to review firms who audited public companies. US congressional hearings to determine if government oversight of the profession resulted in the 1976 Metcalf Report \\"The Accounting Establishment\\". In 1988, the American Institute made Peer Review a Mandatory requirement for Firm membership. Several states began requiring Peer Review as a condition for licensure. Two famous accounting scandals in 2001 and 2002 (Eron and WorldCom) would lead to the 2002 enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX). SOX would replace Peer Review for public company auditors with a structure for government inspections of CPA firms. Florida was slow to enact any Peer Review legislation. Finally in 2013, Florida became the 49th state to enact Peer Review legislation. Florida's Peer Review statute only requires enrollment in a Peer Review program and does not require completion of a Peer Review. Peer Review was first designed as a process to improve practices of CPA firms and the original intent was to be rehabilitative in nature. As such, generally, the peer review reports are used as a basis for discipline. Some states have gone beyond the original intent and required CPA firms to provide Peer Review reports to their State Accountancy Board, posted Peer Review Reports on public websites or used the issuance of multiple failed Peer Reviews as a basis for discipline. Also, the Governmental Accountability Office has issued the Yellow Book, which requires CPA Firms that issue audit reports on financial statements or performance audit reports to provide their Peer Review report to the client prior to commencing the audit.

Individual Mobility NASBA and the AICPA changed the Uniform Accountancy Act in 2007 to encourage mobility of CPA licenses. The concept of mobility allows a CPA to be licensed in its Home State and then to practice as a CPA in other states without completing the unique regulatory requirements of the other states. The principle of mobility is based on three things: 1) no notice requirement of the non home state, 2) no fee paid to the non home state, and 3) agreement to abide by the laws of the non home state and accepting jurisdiction of discipline of the non home state. Florida enacted Individual mobility in 2009. Hawaii is the only state yet to enact mobility. Firm Mobility NASBA and the AICPA further changed the Uniform Accountancy Act in 2014 to encourage mobility of CPA Firm licenses. The concept of Firm mobility allows a CPA Firm to be licensed in states where it has a physical office to practice as a CPA Firm in other states without completing the unique regulatory requirements of the other states. CPA Firm mobility requires compliance with Peer Review requirements and CPA ownership requirements. Florida enacted Firm mobility in 2017. Approximately 26 have either enacted or are in the process of enacting Firm mobility.

He has previously served as Bishop of Cassano all'Jonio from 1988 to 1998, Archbishop of Crotone-Santa Severina from 1998 to 2006, and Metropolitan Archbishop of Benevento from 2006 to 2016.  Biography  Andrea Mugione was born on 9 November 1940 in the Italian comune of Caivano, in the region of Campania. He studied at the diocesan seminary in Aversa and the Pontifical Regional Seminary of Salerno, where he studied philosophy and theology. = Priest = Mugione was ordained a priest in the Aversa Cathedral on 28 June 1964 by Bishop Antonio Cece.

Population According to Nigerian Senator David Mark on a delegation visit to China in May 2014, there are about 10,000 Nigerians living in China. Nigerians are concentrated in Guangzhou, a city in the Guangdong province with a large population of Africans. Chinese Ambassador to Nigeria Gu Xiaojie in 2015 stated Nigerians are the largest African population in China. History Incidents involving local police and Nigerians have sparked riots in 2009 and 2012 by the African community in Guangzhou. In 2009, two Nigerians escaped a police raid on illegal immigrants by jumping through a window. Both men were hurt and rumors of their deaths led to the first riot by any immigrant group in Guangzhou. In 2012, a Nigerian died in police custody after being held in a dispute after fighting with a taxi driver. The reaction by the African community once again escalated into a riot. Reputation According to Sola Onadipe, the Nigerian Ambassador in Beijing from 2014‚Äì2016, Nigerians living in Guangzhou are \\"notorious for nefarious activities with hard drugs\\", provocative public behavior, and illegal immigration. During an interview in February 2014 with the Vanguard, a Nigerian daily, the Ambassador lamented that while there are many migrants in Guangzhou from neighboring African countries of Ivory Coast and Ghana and across Francophone Africa, the police didn't bother those communities, concentrating on the Nigerian community due to high levels of crime and misbehavior. Nigerians were overrepresented among the suspects arrested in a major drug crackdown in July 2013. The raid on the Linhua Hotel (Dragon Hotel) in Yuexiu District, Guangzhou was carried out by 1,300 police officers. The Guangzhou Public Security Bureau arrested 168 suspects, most described as citizens of Nigeria and Mali, and found heroin, methamphetamines, and a large sum of money.

Background ZAPU's vice-president, James Chikerema, planned another infiltration from Zambia during the final months of 1969, intending to send 25 of ZIPRA's best fighters across the Zambezi and then on to four separate destinations, split into four \\"gangs\\": Gang 1 would make for Melsetter in the south-east of the country, Gang 2 would head for Umtali on the Rhodesia‚ÄìMozambique border, and Gangs 3 and 4 would go to the north-eastern towns of Mtoko and Mount Darwin respectively. Three of the 25 refused to operate in Mashonaland, saying that they would only fight for ZIPRA in Matabeleland. Five cadres scouted ahead of the main group from the 11th to 14 December 1969, identifying a safe crossing point and inspecting the route to be taken by the main infiltration squad. The rest of the 22 insurgents crossed during the nights of the 30th and 31 December. The ZIPRA CTs (Communist Terrorists) then made their way south and on 17 January 1970 split up at the foot of the Zambezi escarpment, about west of the Hunyani River. They were detected the following day when two of the five cadres from Gang 1 revealed themselves to a guard manning a fly-gate at Tondongwe in the Doma Safari Area. After selling some food to the guerrillas, the guard reported the incident and Operation Birch was initiated. The Operation The security forces set up a JOC at Mangula at 09:30 on 19 January with 1 Commando present. A tracking team led by Lieutenant Nigel Henson first made contact around noon on 21 January, when concealed ZIPRA cadres from Gang 2 fired upon them with an RPD machine- gun and AK-47 and SKS rifles. Henson's men withdrew and 1 Commando set up stop points around the contact area to contain the guerrillas during the day; night-ambush positions were then set up as darkness fell. The RLI moved up again at dawn the next day and met the insurgents at 07:30, when a stick of five 1 Commando men led by Lieutenant Bruce Snelgar was sighted in an area of thick bush by three guerrillas from Gang 2. The cadres caught Snelgar's stick by surprise, opening fire with a heavy burst of RPD bullets. Snelgar and Trooper McMaster were wounded and Trooper Anthony Brading was shot dead. In the battle which ensued all three ZIPRA fighters were killed with no further loss to the RLI. Over the next few days PATU and RLI patrols arrested five insurgents, two of whom were deserters. One of these defected and agreed to guide the security forces to the ZIPRA base camp, where he said there were two guerrillas waiting for him to return, unaware of his desertion and subsequent defection. Shown the way by the ex-cadre an RLI patrol attacked the camp on 24 January and killed one of the two; the other fled and was captured a few days later. The members of Gang 1 were now all killed or captured while only one was outstanding from Gang 2. Gangs 3 and 4 were revealed to be near Sipolilo on the 2st1 January by a black shopkeeper, and two Gang 3 members were encountered by Henson's troop on 24 January. Henson himself opened fire and killed one, who it emerged was the Gang 3 commander. His troop then followed about 10 terrorists until 26 January, when they lost the insurgents' tracks. RLI patrols were intensified further over the following days, with 3 Commando being brought in to assist around Sipolilo. 13 Troop, 3 Commando, under Sergeant Phil Raath, encountered the 10 terrorists at a kraal near Bakasa, north of Sipolilo, on 31 January, and killed one; the other nine fled. Later that day a patrol led by Corporal Dennis Croukamp captured Phinias Majuru, the ZIPRA Director of Operations. \\"It was only a week later after the patrol was over that we learnt who it was we had captured,\\" Croukamp writes. \\"It was Joshua Nkomo's Chief of Operations. The equivalent of a very senior staff officer, he was in the country trying to determine why ZIPRA was being so unsuccessful and he was on his way back with recommendations, clipboard and all.\\", quoted in The remaining ZIPRA fighters scattered and escaped the area over the following week, the Rhodesian Security Forces losing track of each one. On 9 February 1970 local security force presence was reduced to police, one helicopter and one RLI Commando. A member of Gang 3 was arrested by the Portuguese in Mozambique the next day, but without further developments over the next month, Operation Birch shut down on 5 March 1970. Aftermath Two more members of Gang 4 were detained by police in Mukumbura township on 21 March, and three days later the Portuguese killed one and captured another. The final account for Operation Birch, which had countered the last ZIPRA incursion for six years, was seven cadres killed, thirteen captured and two outstanding. \\"From 1970 onward, ZAPU played no part in the terrorist war,\\" writes Lieutenant-Colonel R. E. H. Lockley. \\"They were in a state of disarray following their decisive defeats within Rhodesia, so they took the opportunity of consolidating their position by sending their terrorists outside the country on extended courses to Russia, Cuba and North Korea. This situation with ZAPU continued until 1976. ... There were no incursions in 1970 worthy of note.\\" References=Bibliography= * Battles and operations of the Rhodesian Bush War ","title":"Operation Birch"},{"id":"56460591","text":"The Crozet, Virginia train crash was a railway accident that occurred on January 31, 2018. A chartered Amtrak train named Congressional Special Train 923, following the route normally used by the Amtrak Cardinal and carrying a group of politicians and lawmakers from the Republican Party, collided with a garbage truck at a level crossing at Lanetown Road in Crozet, Virginia, west of Charlottesville, Virginia. The train was chartered by Republican lawmakers for transportation from Washington Union Station to an annual retreat at The Greenbrier in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia. Several politicians brought their spouses and children with them for the trip; no members of the general public were passengers. Crash At approximately 11:16 a.m. EST (16:16 UTC), Amtrak Congressional Special Train 923 struck the left rear of a garbage truck operated by Time Disposal at a railroad crossing at Lanetown Road near Crozet, Virginia. This caused the truck to rotate counterclockwise and collide with a railroad signal structure next to the tracks. The trailer separated from the cab, and the truck's two passengers were ejected. The crossing is protected by flasher lights and gates, which were operating at the time of collision. According to a witness, the train sounded a prolonged warning with its horn as the truck was trying to cross the track. According to an Albemarle County Police Department statement, 28-year-old truck passenger Christopher Foley died; he had mistakenly been identified by some as the driver. Another passenger was airlifted in critical condition, and the truck driver was taken to the hospital in serious condition. Three train passengers and three Amtrak crewmembers reported minor injuries. Photo of the scene taken by Oregon Rep. Greg Walden shortly after the crash, posted to Twitter Several politicians on the train made statements on the scene to media outlets. Representative Thomas Massie of Kentucky described the incident as \\"... loud and surprising. Some minor bumps and bruises in this car. We saw debris go by the left side of the train. The part of the truck we can see was decimated. Very relieved when the train came to a stop and still on the tracks.\\" Six injured individuals were taken to the University of Virginia Medical Center in Charlottesville. The hospital reported that one of the injured was in critical condition. One member of Congress, Representative Jason Lewis of Minnesota, was taken to the hospital with a concussion. He was treated and released, rejoining the group at the retreat in the early evening. Representative Roger Marshall, M.D. of Kansas, a passenger on the train, administered first aid and CPR to the injured, as did other passengers and local residents with medical training. At 1:15 p.m. EST, the partially derailed lead locomotive, Amtrak P42DC heritage unit #145, was removed from the train to allow the investigation to continue. The remainder of the train was then moved back to Charlottesville Union Station, where the passengers were transferred to waiting buses to continue their trip to the Greenbrier. #145 was repaired and put back into service following the incident. Investigation and criminal charges Post-accident scene at the site The crash was investigated by multiple agencies, with the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) serving as the lead investigative agency. The Federal Railroad Administration, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Albemarle County Police Department, Amtrak and the Buckingham Branch Railroad, who operates the rail line for CSX Transportation, assisted in the NTSB in the investigation. On February 21, 2018, the NTSB published a preliminary report on the accident. It stated the train was traveling at approximately when the engineer engaged the emergency brakes. Witnesses stated the gates were already down when the truck entered the crossing. According to the lead locomotive's front-facing camera, by the time the crossing came into view, the truck was already inside the crossing. After completing their investigation, the Albemarle County Police Department announced on June 8, 2018 that the driver of the garbage truck, Dana William Naylor Jr., was indicted by an Albemarle County grand jury on one count of involuntary manslaughter for the death of truck passenger Christopher Foley. Naylor was also charged with one count of maiming while driving under the influence for causing permanent physical injury to Dennis Eddy, who was also a passenger in the truck. The substance that Naylor is accused of being under the influence of was not named in the announcement.

In 1961 he began his studies at the Royal Academy of Music, with Alan Bush (composition) and Leighton Lucas (orchestration). He was awarded ten prizes for his compositions between 1961 and 1965 including the Eric Coates Prize. After receiving a British Council Scholarship, David Morgan moved to Prague to study at the Academy of Music under Vaclav Dobias. During this period he wrote his Violin Concerto, which was premiered at the Dvo≈ô√°k Hall in Prague. He returned to England in 1967 after which a number of his lighter works were produced by the BBC Light Music Department. In 1974 the violinist Erich Gruenberg performed his Violin Concerto with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Sir Charles Groves at the Royal Festival Hall in London. Morgan's Sinfonia da Requiem was performed there later in the same year. Two of his major works were recorded by Lyrita in 1976 - the Violin Concerto (with Erich Gruenberg) and Contrasts performed by the RPO conducted by Vernon Handley. In 1981 Morgan moved to Canada. He worked as a composer for symphonic wind band, and continued to receive commissions from Britain, including his orchestral Variations on a Theme of Walton. 1984 marked the Canadian Premiere of his Partita by the Kingston Symphony Orchestra and 1986 and 1987 saw the world premiere of Interludes and Canzonas for brass quintet and the Canadian premiere of Concerto for Wind Orchestra.

It has stems that branch only at the foot and are densely set over their entire length with narrowly triangular leathery leaves with a sharp tip at approximately right angles to the stem. At their tip are what at first sight appears to be a single flowerhead with yellow ray florets and yellow disc florets. In fact, these are mostly nine densely cropped heads, as is suggested by the nine domes of the \\"disc\\" of the composite head, the untidy arrangement of the ray florets, and becomes very clear when cutting through the composite head. It is an endemic of the south of the Western Cape province in South Africa.  Description  Oedera capensis is a prickly, sprawling shrublet of about high, that produces between two and six branches below the flower heads of the previous season. Stems are densely and alternately set with mostly hairless, erect to recurved, flat, leathery, narrow triangular leaves long and , with glands and silky hairs along the edges. Usually nine (rarely ten or eleven) flower heads are cropped at the tip of the branches in what seems at first sight a single flower head of mostly in diameter. The central head consists of yolk yellow disc florets only, while the remainder has disc florets and in addition a row of yolk yellow ray florets, burgundy on the reverse, where they do not touch the other heads. A cluster of cropped heads usually has 30 to 40 ray florets. A few shorter ray florets sometimes occur where the heads touch. The involucre that surrounds the cropped heads consist of several whorls of green, leaf-like bracts of usually wide, lanceolate, widest at midlength and with a prominent rib along the midline. The inner row of bracts surrounding the cropped heads have dense, silky hair in the lower part of their edges. The involucral bracts between the individual heads are thin and papery. The pappus consists of a circle of scales around the tip of the cypselas. Flowering usually appears from June to September, rarely extending to December. This species has seven sets of homologue chromosomes (2n=14). = Differences with other species = Oedera imbricata has bright yellow flower heads, not yolk yellow.  Taxonomy  Carl Linnaeus, a Swedish naturalist famous for his introduction of the binominal nomenclature, first described the plant in 1759 as Buphthalmum capense. His son, Carl Linnaeus the Younger later described Oedera prolifera. In 1914, George Claridge Druce reassigned the species, creating the new combination Oedera capensis. South African botanist Margaret Levyns thought Oedera should be split up and she reassigned the species in 1948 to her new genus Eroeda, creating the new combination E. capensis. All of these names are now considered synonymous. The species name capensis refers to the Cape of Good Hope.  Distribution and habitat O. capensis grows on dry stony slopes and flats, roadsides and sandy areas from Albertinia to the Cape Peninsula.  Ecology  In an experiment, 20% of the cypselas germinated after exposure to smoke, while without smoke only 5% sprouted.

The term was attributed to Los Angeles art critic Arthur Millier, and it referred to watercolors, oil paintings and mosaics of landscapes and scenes of everyday life, such as mountain and coastal scenery, pastoral agricultural valleys, and dynamic cities and highways. Varying in style and subject, California Scene Painting was influenced by a range of precursor styles, notably Impressionism (particularly California Impressionism) Cubism, and Realism.  Notable artists  Notable California scene artists included Emil Kosa Jr., Millard Sheets, Milford Zornes, Phil Dike, Rex Brandt, Phil Paradise, Elsie Palmer Payne, George Post (painter), Elsie Lower Pomeroy, Barse Miller, Paul Sample, Dong Kingman, Anders Aldrin, and Charles Payzant.

Early life Rissell lived his first seven years of his life in his hometown of Wellington, Kansas. Rissell lived with his mother, who was married and divorced twice by the time Rissell was 12. Rissell's biological father left the home when Rissell was seven years old. Rissell had two older siblings: a brother, Harold, and a sister. By the age of 14, Rissell had committed his first rape. He was charged with a series of petty crimes and was institutionalized in 1973. Shortly after his release in 1975, he was arrested for attempted robbery after he attempted to rob a woman with a knife in an elevator near his home. He received a five-year suspended sentence and dropped out of T. C. Williams High School at the age of 17. Murders Rissell was reportedly angry with his ex-girlfriend after he saw her with another man. On August 4, 1976, Rissell saw 26-year-old Aura Marina Gabor, a sex worker living in the same apartment complex as Rissell on the 400 block of North Armistead Street in Alexandria. Rissell claimed he grew angry with her after she \\"allowed\\" him to have sex with her and she made it seem like she enjoyed it, so he drowned her in a nearby ravine. The second murder occurred in March 1977, when Rissell raped and stabbed 22-year-old McDonald's manager trainee, Ursula Miltenberger, near the Hamlet Apartments. Her body was found March 6 in a Fairfax wood. An unspecified time later, Rissell attempted to murder an unknown woman; however, the would-be victim was let go after she told him her father had cancer, from which Rissell's brother also suffered. The third murder victim was 27-year-old Gladys Ross Bradley, a post office clerk and resident of Hamlet Apartments. Sometime in April 1977, Rissell waited outside her house with a steak knife from his mother's kitchen. He raped her twice, then dragged her by her feet to a nearby creek, where he then drowned her. Her body was found April 29, 1977. The fourth murder victim was 34-year-old Aletha Byrd, a personnel counselor at the Woodward & Lothrop department store at Tysons Corner Center. Aletha had been missing from her home since April 10, 1977. She was found dead with multiple stab wounds on May 17 in a wooded area. The fifth and final victim was 24-year-old Jeanette McClelland, a graphics design proofreader at Bru-El Graphics and also a resident of Hamlet Apartments. She was found raped and stabbed 100 times in a culvert near Shirley Highway on May 5, 1977. On May 18, police (who had Rissell under surveillance due to his being a suspect) searched Rissell's car and found Byrd's wallet, keys, and comb. Police later confirmed that Rissell's fingerprints were found on Miltenberger's car. Rissell confessed to killing all five women. Rissell was charged with abducting, raping and murdering the five women. However, because he pleaded guilty to the murder charges, the abduction and rape charges were dropped. Rissell was sentenced to five consecutive life sentences on October 11, 1977. He was 18 years old at the time of his sentencing. Prison While in prison, Rissell wrote a 461-page handwritten manuscript detailing his murders. Rissell became eligible for parole in 1995, which was heavily protested by the victims' family members and the community. Since then, Rissell has been granted an annual parole hearing each November; he has been denied parole each time. Rissell was previously incarcerated at Augusta Correctional Center, and is currently incarcerated at Pocahontas State Correctional Center in Virginia.

There are several types of horoscopes used in this religion, including a birth horoscope, a life forecast, an annual horoscope, a marriage horoscope, and a death horoscope. When casting the death horoscope, Tibetan Buddhists place great importance on the corpse, especially within the first three days following its death. There are several purposes for a death horoscope, and carrying out this practice must be done carefully. Additionally, a death horoscope is intended as a loving act for the dead, and a precautionary measure for the family of the deceased. Many Tibetans believe that when a death occurs within the family, other family members‚Äô lives are jeopardized, so this practice may be considered essential to both the living and dead. Tibetan Buddhists also believe that their deceased loved ones may spend a short period in hell to pay for sins in their past life. Purpose Death horoscopes serve several purposes, including, determining the right time for disposing of the deceased's body, understanding the presumed rebirth destination, and revealing how the deceased's family can improve their rebirth. Additionally, the horoscope may reveal the past life of the dead and whether or not the death was well-timed. The horoscope also serves as a precautionary tool to reveal specific types of threats from demons and future attacks targeted at living family members. In fact, the lama conducts a preventative ceremony before the astrologer casts the death horoscope to prevent any of the eight classes of demonic spirits from harming the deceased. According to some, the chanting of mantras may combat the demons and ward off evil spirits, as well as help interpret the death chart. The death chart indicates who can have contact with the body, and whether certain household items must be removed. Lastly, the astrologer may be able to reveal who will facilitate the corpse's disposal, including carrying, preparing, and cremating it. Procedure The initial step in casting the death horoscope includes immediately informing all family and close friends of the death . The corpse is not to be touched or shifted from its position at the moment of death, and the family must wait for the lama or astrologer to arrive. The mourning families may offer a present or fee to the astrologer for the horoscope, to ensure a favorable outcome for the soul. The corpse remains inside the house until the astrologer concludes his calculation. Once the lama arrives, he may perform a religious ritual, known as a phowa (from Sanskrit), which is then followed by the astrologer casting the death horoscope. The lama removes all mourning family members from the death chamber, and closes all windows and doors. He then covers the corpse's face with a white cloth, and sits down next to its head. He is said to draw the remaining consciousness from the corpse through the top of the head. Then, he extracts some hairs from the corpse's head to allow the soul to exit the body through the roots. He, or the astrologer, indicates whether there is any life remaining in the corpse. According to some, the corpse's consciousness may linger from one life to another for 49 days. So, the lama reads the Tibetan book of the dead, Bardo Thodol, out loud to guide the corpse in its new life. It is important that the body remains undisturbed while the lama guides the spirit because any disruption could cause the soul to drift in an unnatural direction and be seized by a demon. Other monks may arrive as well, to provide blessings in preparation for the death horoscope. Offering-rites, at this time, are performed as a precautionary measure to ward off demons. The astrologer may then create a grid on the floor or on a sheet of paper, using only rice flour and black pebbles. He constructs the grid and the placement of the materials based on the instruction given in his astrological text. He then reads some of the texts from the astrological manual or a calendar. To calculate the death horoscope, the astrologer considers the time, date, year, and month of the death, and the constellation and phase of the moon. The birth year of the deceased, however, is typically considered the most important factor, because it indicates the deceased's birth animal and trigram. Additionally, the body's position at the final moment of death is essential for the direction the body should be removed and disposed of. The horoscope may also reveal the deceased's last thoughts, and if the thoughts were negative or positive. In the event that they were negative, the family may be given the chance to create and transfer good karma to the deceased's future life. Additionally, the horoscope specifies which actions by the family, will help the deceased in their rebirthed life.

Blanchard House was built as a private house located at 253 East Main Street in Ionia, Michigan. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. As of 2018, it serves as the museum for the Ionia County Historical Society. History John C. Blanchard was born in New York in 1822. He began working in a mill at age 14, saved enough money to move west, and in 1836 transported himself to Michigan. He worked on farms near Detroit and in Shiawassee County, bought a farm, then moved on to work as a farm laborer and clerk in Lyons, Michigan. In 1840 he began studying law, and in 1842 was admitted to practice. In 1850, he was elected prosecuting attorney, and moved to Ionia. He eventually served in multiple political offices, including Registrar of the Ionia land office and President of Ionia Township. In 1879, Blanchard began construction of this sandstone Italianate residence. The house was finished in 1881, and Blanchard lived there until his death in 1905. The Ionia County Historical Society eventually purchased the house in 1974, and it serves as their museum. Description The Blanchard House is a massive Italianate mansion faced with pink and brown sandstone and with a slate hipped roof. The house measures 47 feet by 52 feet. It sits on a heavy foundation of smooth, squared sandstone about four feet high, topped with a protruding water table. Above this, quoins outline the corners of the house. The windows are tall, set on sandstone sills and topped with elaborate, semicircular sandstone window hoods.

The unit was raised by an Act of Parliament instigated by the Secretary of State for War Henry Dundas who thought light cavalry would be particularly effective against any invading force. It was filled by means of an obligation from Britain's horse owners, who had to provide one trooper for every ten horses owned ‚Äì a method which drew comparisons to the feudal system. Each county had a quota of cavalrymen that it was expected to provide. The act was unpopular and the number and quality of recruits was low. Dundas preferred the Yeomanry Cavalry system of volunteers and in 1798 instigated measures to increase their numbers, exempting counties from the obligation to raise Provisional Cavalry where the Yeomanry could provide at least 75% of the demanded quota. This proved highly effective with the number of Yeomanry exceeding Dundas' expectations. The Provisional Cavalry was disbanded by 1802 and the enabling act was allowed to lapse in 1806.  Origins  Britain in early 1796 was in the midst of the French Revolutionary Wars and following defeats of her allies on the continent feared invasion. These fears later proved well founded with the occurrence of the December 1796 French expedition to Ireland and the February 1797 landings at Fishguard. The British government became concerned that there were too few cavalrymen in the existing British Volunteer Corps (known as Yeomanry Cavalry). Cavalry were thought to be essential in defeating an invading force, which would be hampered by the limited number of horses it could bring by ship. At the proposal of the Secretary of State for War, Henry Dundas, parliament passed the Provisional Cavalry Act in 1796. This act established the Provisional Cavalry, which was liable for service anywhere in the country (some militia units were liable for service only within their own counties). Dundas was also responsible for raising the Fencibles and the Supplementary Militia for home defence. The Provisional Cavalry was raised by imposing liabilities upon those men in the country that owned horses. Those liable were required to provide one cavalry trooper for every ten horses owned (those who owned fewer than ten horses were collected into groups which were each required to provide one man). The method of recruitment has been described as a form of revival of the feudal system whereby vassals were required to provide a quota of knights for their lord. The British Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger set an expected strength for the Provisional Cavalry of 20,000 men.  Service  Unlike the yeomanry cavalry, who were paid only when called up, troopers of the provisional cavalry received a wage. They sometimes took part in military exercises and camps with the yeomanry. A quota was established for each county that it was expected to keep. However the Provisional Cavalry was unpopular, being a drain on the county funds and effectively conscripting members of the landowning class. The Provisional Cavalry levies of 1797 failed to provide the minimum numbers that Dundas had set. In March of that year Colonel Mark Wood decried the unit in a parliamentary speech as an \\"unpopular measure ... so little calculated to afford any adequate degree of security to the public\\". Roman Catholics were prohibited from serving in the unit, though William Wilberforce campaigned for them to be allowed to do so. Dundas described his intentions for the various cavalry units in case of an invasion. The regular cavalry was to attack the enemy, the Yeomanry to preserve the peace in civilian areas and the Provisional Cavalry to drive away cattle and carry out similar duties of a \\"hussar nature\\". A near contemporary press report stated that the provisional cavalry was not dependable as a fighting force and might only be useful as escorts for baggage and provisions; though the writer also stated that a select few of the younger and more active members might have been useful as light cavalry if placed under experienced officers.  Decline and disbandment  Dundas seems to have come to the conclusion that the volunteer Yeomanry provided a more effective force and that if it could be increased to sufficient numbers could supersede the Provisional Cavalry. In May 1798 Dundas exempted Yeomanry men from being selected for service in the Provisional Cavalry (the Volunteer Corps infantry were exempted in 1799). He also allowed counties to absolve themselves of the need for raising Provisional Cavalry if their Yeomanry regiments could muster more than 75% of the cavalry quota. This led to a rapid increase in the ranks of the Yeomanry Cavalry ‚Äì in the first six months of 1798 their number increased from less than 10,000 to more than 22,000. The Buckinghamshire Yeomanry expanded from six troops in 1794 to more than 50 in 1798, easily satisfying Dundas' quota for the county. The yeomanry were cheaper to raise and maintain, easier to train and proved more willing to serve when commanded. Despite this Dundas was initially keen to retain the provisional cavalry in counties where effective forces had been raised but, convinced by the rapid expansion in Yeomanry, was soon making arrangements to retire the force. Dundas made the first arrangements to disband units of the Provisional Cavalry in June 1798 and within a year of doing so the numbers of Yeomanry had reached levels that exceeded what Dundas considered the maximum that was useful for the defence of the country. Only six regiments of Provisional Cavalry were ever embodied, and only the provisional cavalry of Worcestershire was called upon to serve ‚Äì doing so in Ireland. Units that were not embodied were absorbed into the Yeomanry where they were often ostracised for their lower social status. By 1800, the embodied units had been disbanded, and the Provisional Cavalry as a distinct organisation was disbanded with the Peace of Amiens in 1802. The parliamentary act enabling the recruitment of the Provisional Cavalry was allowed to lapse by the government in 1806.

Early life  Williams was born in Oakland, California, and raised in Gridley, California by her mother, Barbara Artie King Liggett, an artist, pianist, and torch singer. Her father, David P. Williams, was a social worker and organizer who worked with Cesar Chavez and Ralph Nader, and also performed professionally as a comedian in San Francisco in the early 1950s. Williams started singing professionally right out of high school, mainly influenced by Harry Nilsson, Randy Newman, and especially Bessie Smith. Her later influences include singers June Christy and Anita O'Day. Career=East Coast US= 174x174px At eighteen years old, Williams moved to Boston and met \\"Stormin‚Äô Norman\\" Zamcheck, a composer and boogie-woogie piano player with a degree in literature from Yale University. As a musical duo, they created a unique \\"rag'n'roll\\" style combining boogie-woogie, blues, rock, and jazz. Together they toured the U.S. east coast for 12 years, eventually playing Carnegie Hall and garnering very favorable reviews from the New York Times, Rolling Stone, and Cosmopolitan.

Also, two intermediate schools serve students in the fifth and sixth grades‚ÄîInman and Summit; one junior high school and one high school, are in the district. Also, a magnet school hosts kindergarten through 6th grade ‚Äì John Thomas School of Discovery. The Nixa school district is widely considered one of the best in Missouri, receiving the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education's Distinction in Performance Award for each of the last five years. In its Missouri Assessment Program, Nixa Junior High placed fifth in the state in science, eighth in math, and 18th in English. The high school was ranked fourth in the state for high academic performance. History In the 1800s when most schools in the United States were first starting to become established, there were 84 to 103 one- room schoolhouses scattered throughout Christian County. These schoolhouses generally served 20 to 35 students who usually walked to school. These schools also had one teacher who wore many hats, such as instructor, custodian, and disciplinarian. When the Nixa School District was formed in 1899, there was no school board, no teacher, no school building, or even land to build one. In 1901, Nixa's first school for all grades was built. Local history says that Walter Keltner, the president of Nixa's first Board of Education, purchased the land for the school and gave it to the school district. In the past 100 years, the Nixa Public School system has grown dramatically. Once only had a one-room schoolhouse, now 12 separate buildings. The first year, had four students graduates in the two-year high school in 1908. In 2017 Nixa had 1,685 students in the high school. Nixa has grown from the original total enrollment of 149 students in 1926 to 6,122 in 2017. Nixa Public Schools has indeed come a long way from its established date in 1899.

Early life and education Puggaard was born into a family of merchants on 7 January 1818 in Copenhagen. His father, Hans Puggaard had founded H. Puggaard & Co. in 1813. His mother, Bolette Puggaard, n√©e Hage, was the daughter of Christopher Friedrich Hage, a wealthy merchant from Stege on M√∏n.

Life  Andr√© Jourdain was born at Saint-Andr√©, a village along the Maurienne valley in the mountains of Savoy. He grew up, during the revolutionary years, supervised by an uncle described as one of the most respected parish priests in the Maurienne diocese. He himself was ordained into the diaconate on 15 December 1805 and into the priesthood on 23 April 1806. Jourdain rose rapidly within the church hierarchy. While still only a deacon he became a professor of Dogma and Morals at the Main Seminary at Chamb√©ry, and by the early 1830s had risen to become a canon and vicar- general (administrative deputy-bishop) for the diocese of Saint-Jean-de- Maurienne.Pierre-√âtienne Duc, Le clerg√© d'Aoste de 1800 √† 1870 Imprimerie J-B Mensio Aoste, 1870. p. 100. On 13 June 1832 the new king announced Jourdain's selection as the new Bishop of Aosta, which since shortly after the restoration had been controlled as suffragant diocese to the Archdiocese of Chamb√©ry‚ÄìSaint-Jean-de-Maurienne (most of which, however, covered the region to the north of Mont Blanc from which Aosta was not readily accessible). The appointment received papal endorsement on 2 July 1832 and on 23 September 1832 the new Bishop of Aosta was consecrated in the cathedral at Saint-Jean-de- Maurienne by Antoine Martinet, the Archbishop of Chamb√©ry, in the presence as co-consecrators of the two local bishops, Pierre-Joseph Rey and Antoine Rochaix, bishops respectively of Annecy and Tarentaise. Andr√© Jourdain took possession of his diocese by proxy that same day, and in person on 7 October 1832. A synod was held at Aosta on 27, 28 and 29 October 1835, after which were published the Synodical Constitutions and Instructions for the diocese. The period was one of significant development of Catholic instruction in the Aosta Valley, notably, for the girls, with the Congregation of the Sisters of St. Joseph and, for the boys, with the Brothers of the Christian Schools. However, Aosta was not immune from the rising tide of church:state rivalry rolling across western Europe, and in 1857 the religious teachers would be replaced by the municipality with secular instructors, the monks and nuns being expelled in 1860.Joseph-Marie Henry, Histoire populaire, religieuse et civile de la Vall√©e d'Aoste (1929), r√©√©dition en 1967, pp. 414, 422-427 The Bishop of Aosta found himself in a particularly intense confrontation with one of the cathedral canons, F√©lix Orsi√®res, an unapologetic proponent of a version of Liberal Catholicism, and the editor of \\"Feuille d'annonces d'Aoste\\", the region's first regular news-journal. In 1851 Orsi√®res went public with his views on what a bishop should and should not be permitted to do. Outside the Aosta Valley, Orsi√®res contended, the bishop should not celebrate Mass without first obtaining written permission to do so. A series of further published opinions from Orsi√®res indicated more wide ranging differences. Jourdain reacted to this gratuitous insubordination with the support from his deputy, the vicar-general Jacques-Joseph Jans, who headed up a commission to investigate Orsi√®res. By the end of 1851, Orsi√®res' writings had been added to the Index of Censorship. The dispute rumbled on till 1855 when, threatened with excommunication, Orsi√®res backed down with a written submission, and was accordingly permitted by Jourdain to remain a member of the priesthood. The conflict involving the liberal Canon Orsi√®res provided a context for another significant event - locally - in which Jourdain became involved was the so-called \\"3e insurrection des Socques\\" (loosely: \\"Third insurrection of the cloggies\\").The name, which may have carried a derogatory undertone, bu which has nevertheless survived, given to the revolt recalled earlier revolts of clog wearing poor people against the Jacobin establishment during the French Revolution in 1799 and again, after church bells were removed, in 1801. The \\"cloggies\\" in question were poor peasants with powerful Christian beliefs who rose up in the face of new taxes and measures deemed anti-clerical - notably the cancellation of certain religiously based celebrations - implemented by the national government under the direction of \\"Prime minister\\" Cavour in Turin. Bands of rioters descended on Aosta during 26, 27 and 28 December 1853. On 29 December Bishop Andr√© Jourdain agreed to join with the Syndic of Aosta, Bruno Favre, who was considered a liberal, in order to persuade the rioters to return to their homes. However, 532 people were arrested and 78 locked up, while 26 escaped custody. Four priests locked up in the hilltop prison of Fort Bard faced trial but, like most of those arrested, were then acquitted. The liberal press, represented in Aosta by the \\"Constitutionnel Vald√¥tain\\" newspaper which had been published since 1848, took the opportunity to attack the bishop and clergy for allegedly having stirred up the rioters in the first place, and the lawyer Laurent Martinet, who sat as a member of parliament representing the Aosta Valley, communicated these anti-clerical accusations to the parliament in Turin. Jourdain, who was inclined to political conservatism, addressed a letter to the priests and parishioners in 1854 in which he added the \\"Constitutionnel Vald√¥tain\\" and the writings of Canon Orsi√®res to the banned list. Andr√© Jourdain died at Aosta on 28 May 1859. After he died the tensions arising between the king, his \\"Prime minister\\" and the Holy See in the aftermath of the 1859 war made it impossible for a successor bishop to be appointed for another seven years. Until 1867 the diocese was administered by the \\"vicaire capitulaire\\" (and future bishop) Jacques-Joseph Jans.

He is best known for his association with Edward Low and Francis Spriggs, and for his involvement with two well-known and well-documented maroonings. Biography Most commonly known as Englishman ‚ÄúJohn Russell‚Äù, his real name may have been Juan or John Lopez; he was in reality a Portuguese Catholic. Like a number of other pirates of the Golden Age, he was a Jacobite who professed support for England's ousted Catholic King James II over his Protestant successors. Various sources paint him alternately as a Captain in his own right, or merely as Low's quartermaster. He was argumentative and well-versed in the pirates‚Äô Articles, not above using them to secure his own ends. Rather than fly the Jolly Roger flag, Russell instead flew English flags in order to surprise his targets. History Russell was Edward Low's quartermaster in June 1722 when they captured a series of vessels off Shelburne, Nova Scotia, near Cape Sable. Among the sailors was Philip Ashton, whom Low forced to join his crew despite Ashton's pleas and his refusal to sign Low's articles. A few days later Low permitted two boys to take a small boat ashore to retrieve his dog; the boys ran away and an infuriated Russell accused Ashton of complicity in their escape, nearly killing Ashton several times: > I was forced to tell him, I knew not of their design; and indeed I did not, > tho' I had good reason to supect what would be the event of their going. > This did not pacifie the Quarter-Master, who with outragious Cursing and > Swearing clapt his Pistol to my Head, and snap'd it; but it miss'd Fire: > this enraged him the more; and he repeated the snapping of his Pistol at my > Head three times, and it as often miss'd Fire; upon which he held it over- > board, and snap'd it the fourth time, and then it went off very readily. ‚Ä¶ > The Quarter-Master upon this, in the utmost fury, drew his Cutlash, and fell > upon me with it, but I leap'd down into the Hold, and got among a Crowd that > was there, and so escaped the further effects of his madness and rage. Low then sailed for the African coast where he captured ships near Cape Verde, with Spriggs sailing alongside in Low's former vessel. Among their captures in September 1722 was Captain George Roberts‚Äô ship. Roberts described Russell as the commanding one of three vessels in the pirates‚Äô flotilla. The pirates held Roberts for over a week, Russell repeatedly threatening him over his refusal to join the pirates. When the crew voted to release Roberts and his boys, Russell instead argued to strip Roberts‚Äô ship of sails, water, food, and all other useful gear before setting him free. Russell was successful, using the strict terms of their articles to make his case. Other pirate officers smuggled a few provisions to Roberts (who made it to land and endured many adventures before returning home) and warned Russell not to abuse his position: \\"Ay, said the Gunner, and take Care, Russell ‚Ä¶ you have got the Company's Assent in this, I cannot tell how, and therefore I shall say no more, only that I, as I believe most of the Company, came here to get Money, but not to kill, except in Fight, and not in cold Blood or for private Revenge.\\" Ashton escaped Russell and Low in March 1723 when they stopped near Roatan, where he was marooned for over a year. He penned his memoirs soon after his rescue. Roberts‚Äô own account (The four years voyages of capt. George Roberts) was published in 1726 and has since been generally attributed to Daniel Defoe. Some sources dispute the Defoe attribution and maintain that Roberts‚Äô account is trustworthy; others claim Defoe (or another author) read Ashton's Memorial and crafted Roberts‚Äô tale as a fictionalized version of it. Both accounts feature Russell prominently. Charles Harris, who was also a quartermaster of Low's and had captained his prize ships, was sailing alongside Low in June 1723. They engaged the Greyhound man-of-war; Harris was defeated and captured while Low made his escape. Low had earlier parted with Spriggs after an argument; Russell was not mentioned during either incident, or during the various accounts of Harris‚Äô, Low's, and Spriggs‚Äô fates.

(formerly WiLan Inc.) is a Canadian public technology holding company, based in Ottawa, Ontario. It was founded in 1992 as a wireless technology company. In the mid-2000s, it gradually transitioned into a patent licensing company. In 2017, it renamed itself Quarterhill, and is attempting to become a holding company specializing in the Internet of Things. It is listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange and NASDAQ.  History  WiLan was founded in 1992 by Hatim Zaghloul and Michel Fattouche to commercialize their Wideband Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (WOFDM) technology. It was originally based in Calgary, Alberta, and the name was an acronym for \\"Wireless Local Area Network\\". In March 1998, WiLAN had its initial public offering on the Alberta Stock Exchange at $2.50 per share (it later listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange). WiLAN enjoyed significant success in the context of the tech bubble at the time, but its fortunes changed when the bubble collapsed. From October 1999 to March 2000, WiLan's share price increased from $10 to $94, but it fell back down to $12 by November 2000. By February 2006, the price had fallen to 66 cents. In 2005, WiLAN reached a significant patent licensing deal with Cisco Systems. In 2006 WiLAN divested its various technology product lines to refocus its business on licensing intellectual property and patent rights. As part of this change of strategy, it replaced its CEO, Bill Dunbar, with Jim Skippen, who served as President and CEO of WiLAN until July 2018. Founder Hatim Zaghloul, who disagreed with the company's change of strategy, resigned from the board. At the same time, the company moved its headquarters from Calgary to Ottawa. The company's change in strategy was initially successful, and it managed to sign a $50 million license deal with Nokia, allowing Nokia to use WiLAN's wireless patents. From 2006 to 2011, WiLAN expanded its portfolio of patents from 20 to 3,000. WiLAN in turn licensed out this patented technology to companies such as Nokia, LG Electronics, Samsung, Fujitsu, RIM, Intel, Broadcom and Panasonic. From 2011 to 2015, WiLAN experienced significant tailwinds, as a less favorable legal climate led to licencees less willing to pay for patents. Of particular note was WiLAN's 2013 loss of a patent lawsuit against Apple Inc. in June 2015, WiLAN announced it had signed a multi-year licensing agreement with Samsung, allowing Samsung to use technology in WiLAN's new Qimonda portfolio. In late 2015, WiLAN announced that, beginning in October 2015, it would undergo a significant company restructuring. As part of this restructuring, WiLAN announced that it would spin off its research and development unit and cut its dividend to shareholders. The restructuring would affect 30 per cent of WiLAN's workforce. The company would also focus on licensing patent portfolios owned by other companies and helping companies monetize their patents. In April 2017, WiLAN acquired International Road Dynamics, a Saskatoon-based road traffic management system engineering company, for $63.5 million. In May 2017, it acquired VIZIYA, a software services provider, for $40 million. These acquisitions were part of a broader restructuring at WiLAN from a patent licensing company to a more diversified technology holding company, specializing in the industrial Internet of Things. As part of the restructuring, WiLan was renamed Quarterhill, although the Will Inc., was created, which contains WiLan Inc., International Road Dynamics, and VIZIYA as subsidiaries. In October 2019, Quarterhill announced that Doug Parker had resigned as President and CEO of Quarterhill. Parker was hired as CEO in January 2018. The company also announced that Parker had resigned from Quarterhill's board at the same time.  Business  Quarterhill's principal business is patent licensing, through its WiLAN subsidiary. Its business model is to acquire technology patents, and then license them to companies who use them. The model relies on the threat of legal action against companies who use its patents without permission. It has thus sometimes been described as a patent troll, because it profits from patents, but does not commercialize or develop technologies itself. As of 2015, WiLAN had more than 250 licencees.

Career Okpokwasili has risen to become a key figure in the New York experimental dance scene. In addition to several one-woman performances, including those highlighted below, she is known for her frequent collaborations with Ralph Lemon and Peter Born, her husband. Born often designs the lighting, staging, and directs Okpokwasili's performances.

Selected works=Pent Up: A Revenge Dance= This was her first collaborative piece with her husband, Peter Born. She won a 2010 New York Dance Award and a 2009 Performance Bessie Award for Outstanding Production. Centering on a mother and daughter, the work considered cultural and generational clashes. =Bronx Gothic= In this 90-minute one-woman semi- autobiographical performance which she also choreographed, Okpokwasili plays two young black girls talking about growing up, feeling vulnerable, and discovering sexuality. As the audience enters, she is already on the stage and is trembling in a dark slip. Eventually she begins to speak the dialogue of the two girls in conversation. The work is the subject of a documentary by Andrew Rossi that shares the title of the performance work. The film illuminates some of the process of creating the work, includes clips of Okpokwasili answering questions from the audience when she toured the piece, and candid discussions with her husband about race, and features her parents and their reaction to her art.Glenn Kenny, Review: Okwui Okpokwasili's 'Bronx Gothic' From Stage to Screen, The New York Times, July 11, 2017.

The work was commissioned by the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council. =Poor People's TV Room= This work considers the subject of women's resistance movements in Nigeria, specifically the Women's War in 1929, when the country was under British rule, and the kidnapping of 300 schoolgirls in 2014 by Boko Haram. As part of this project, Okpokwasili also researched the film industry in Nigeria, known as Nollywood, considering representations of women in a cinema where African and Western cultures intersect.Ivan Talijancic, \\"Divining the Shadows: Okwui Okpokwasili's Poor People's TV Room\\", The Brooklyn Rail, April 1, 2017. In an interview with Jenn Joy for Bomb magazine, Okpokwasili stated that the piece \\"is about a critical absence that I feel when a tragedy happens‚Äîlike the kidnapping of girls by Boko Haram and the Women's War in Nigeria. My work is not explicitly about the incredible women in northern Nigeria who came together to shame their government into doing something to get these 300 abducted girls back. African women are not just victims of colonizers and oppressive or corrupt governments. They have been building collectives and advocating and fighting to be visible for a long time. I don‚Äôt want to make documentary work‚Äîbut I don‚Äôt want these women to disappear, either. My piece is about visibility.\\" She has cited as a major influence the Nigerian novelist Amos Tutuola, who is known for incorporating elements of Yoruba folklore into his works. The research Okpokwasili completed for Poor People's TV Room also informed Sitting on a Man‚Äôs Head, a work the artist presented at the 2018 Berlin Biennale.

Military career At the age of 16 he joined the Belgian 1st regiment of Carabiniers as a volunteer. In 1886 Molitor won an appointment to the Royal Military Academy in Brussels. He graduated in 1889, and was commissioned as second lieutenant in the 2e r√©giment de Chasseurs √† Pied. In 1900 he was assigned a job at the Ministry of War and from 1906 to 1909 he was the Batman of general Jacoby. In 1912 he was commissioned as major in the Force Publique and in 1913 he was responsible for inspecting the military posts on the eastern border of the Belgian Congo in the Province Orientale. In 1913-14 he warned the Belgian government in a paper of what he called 'the German threat' in German East Africa and advised to reform and strengthen the Force Publique, while the colonial officials at that time stressed the importance of the neutrality of the Belgian Congo. In 1915 Molitor was assigned to form the Brigade Nord which he was to command during the Tabora Offensive. At the end of April 1916 Molitor advanced to German East Africa, his brigade occupied Kigali on 6 May 1916, Biharamulo on 24 June and St. Micha√´l on 21 August. His brigade faced supply difficulties, and because of the absence of a railway line from Kigali to Tabora, he was to advance at a slower pace than Brigade Sud. In 1918 Molitor was appointed to reorganize the Force Publique and was promoted to the rank of major general. In 1919 he was sent back to Belgium and assumed command of the 5th infantry division, in 1923 he was promoted to lieutenant general and took command of the 1st infantry division.

Wallace Traditions and Heritage The fraternity magazine was \\"The Journal of Beta Kappa\\"Beta Kappa chapter of Theta Chi The Fraternity's colors were Purple and Gold. Its flower was the Red Templar Rose. The badge was in the shape of a diamond in black enamel, longer from top to bottom, with 24 pearls on its perimeter. It held a small, white circular disk in the center, on this a coiled serpent above a lamp and below were two crossed swords. On the sides of the disk were the Greek letters Œí and Œö. The fraternity had been a member of the NIC. Merger During the height of WWII the fraternity merged with Theta Chi, with the exception of its Georgia Tech chapter, which became the Beta Kappa chapter of Lambda Chi Alpha that same year. The mother chapter at Hamline University was granted the chapter name, Beta Kappa chapter to honor its rank as a former Alpha chapter.

Robert Thorpe in Kashmir. Lieutenant Robert Thorpe (1838‚Äì1868), an officer of the British Indian Army, visited Kashmir during the reign of Maharaja Ranbir Singh and wrote about the sufferings of the Kashmiri people. His writings were compiled into a book Cashmere Misgovernment and published in London in 1870. Thorpe also appealed to the British soldiers, who raised funds for Christian Missionary Society to send medical help to the Kashmir Valley. This eventually led to the founding of the British Mission Hospital in Srinagar. Historians state that Thorpe's life is shrouded in \\"myth, memory and history\\". He is regarded in Kashmir as a martyr who died for the cause of Kashmiris.  Family According to Jane Strand, a surviving relative of Robert Thorpe, Robert Thorpe was born in 1838 to parents Thomas Thorp (died 1854), a solicitor in Alnwick in Northumberland, and Elizabeth Jane Tudor (died 1890) from Bath, Somerset. Robert had a brother William Tudor Thorp, who was a vicar and the great grandfather of Jane Strand. Other versions of his background are current in Kashmir. According to writer Fida Hassnain, Robert Thorpe's father was Lt. Col. R. Thorpe of the British Army. On a holiday to Kashmir in 1833, Col. Thorpe is said to have fallen in love with a Kashmiri woman named Amiran, the daughter of a landlord in Shoguin, and the two were married. Then they are said to have gone back to Britain, where Robert Thorpe was born. According to another version from Justice Yusuf Saraf, Robert Thorpe's mother was Jani (Jan Bibi), the daughter of Daim Rathore (Dayim Rathore) of Kishtwar. To be able to marry her, Col. Thorp had to convert to Islam. Robert Thorpe is said to have been the youngest of three children.Shams S. Rehman, A beautiful Muslim bride started the Kashmir link, Manchester Evening News, 21 August 2007.Sheikh Showkat Hussain, Robert Thorpe‚Äôs loyalties lay with British, Kashmir Dispatch, 22 November 2013. Kumar and Dar note the inconsistencies in the various narratives.: \\"For some, Thorpe‚Äôs mother was Janna, for others it was Janni, for some she was the daughter of a landlord from Budgam, while for others she was daughter of the ruler of Kishtwar. For some, Robert Thorpe was a Muslim, because his father had converted to Islam, while for others Robert Thorpe was a Christian whose cemetery can still be seen in the Sheikh Bagh Christian graveyard in Srinagar.\\" Life and career According to Jane Strand's information, Robert went to school first in Durham and later in Surrey. He was commissioned in the 98th foot regiment of British Army in India (British Indian Army in modern terminology) in February 1858. He resigned from the Army in February 1867. When Thorpe entered Kashmir around 1865, he was a Lieutenant. Scholar Sheikh Showkat Hussain believes that Thorpe was sent to Kashmir on a mission, to prepare the case for British intervention in Kashmir.  Writings on Kashmir  Between 1865 and 1868, Thorpe travelled extensively in the villages, collecting information about the living conditions, economy, taxation, and the state apparatus. He wrote scathing articles on the Dogra rule in Anglo-Indian newspapers. He wrote to the British officials at Lahore (provincial capital of Punjab) and Calcutta (capital of British India). But his writings also contained a strong political message. He was advocating the British annexation of Kashmir, a prevailing view among the British officials at that time. His attack on the Dogra rulers and the Treaty of Amritsar that transferred Kashmir to the Dogras were scathing: His writings did not lead to annexation of Kashmir. However, the British government brought the state of Jammu and Kashmir into a subsidiary alliance, placing a British Resident in Kashmir. Other than the political messages, scholars find Thorpe's writings valuable for the detailed information they provide on the state of the early Dogra administration. They describe the patterns of land tenure and revenue administration, the tax administration of the shawl industry, transport of supplies for troops and the system of begar (forced labour for the state). They bring to fore the \\"poverty, oppression and degradation\\" that characterised the early Dogra administration. The writings were compiled into a book Cashemre Misgovernment published by Longmans, Green and Company in London in the year 1870. The book has been republished many times, two modern editions including those edited by S. N. Gadru and Fida Hassnain. Death Thorpe died in Srinagar on 22 November 1868 under mysterious circumstances. The cause of death was determined by the British doctor as a rupture of the heart. Poisoning was alleged and continues to be suspected even though the doctor ruled it out. Cecil Tyndale-Biscoe, who went as a Christian missionary to Kashmir in 1890, informs us that prior to his death, Thorpe was ordered out of the state by the Maharaja. When he refused to leave, he was tied to his bed and carried to the pass. Thorpe is said to have escaped and returned to Srinagar. His death occurred the following day. Fida Hassnain, on the other hand, states that the Maharaja's men attacked Thorpe when he went to the Shankaracharya Hill near the Dal Lake (also called the Takhat-i-Sulaiman), and he died on the spot. The source of this information is not specified. Thorpe was buried at a Christian cemetery at Shaikh Bagh. The carving on the grave states, \\"He gave his life for Kashmir\\". Legacy Robert Thorpe's appeals for help mobilised other British officers such as Sir Robert Montgomery, who was the Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab, Sir Herbert Edwards, Colonel Martin and Colonel Urmston, who got together and raised funds for sending a medical missionary to Kashmir with the help of the Christian Missionary Society. Doctor William Jackson Elmslie went as a missionary doctor in 1864. His work is said to have been obstructed by the Maharaja's administration, but he continued until his death in 1872. Afterwards, the Society sent Doctor Theodore Maxwell who was able to get land from the administration for building a basic Mission Hospital at Rustum Gari, close to the Takhat-i-Sulaiman. Dr. Arthur Neve, who succeeded him, built the present hospital. In 1967, Fida Hassnain wrote an article on Robert Thorpe in a local newspaper calling him \\"the first martyr\\" of Kashmir. Major Afzal arranged the first anniversary memorial at the grave of Robert Thorpe, and since then it is remembered every year.

Human breast milk has been traditionally assumed to be sterile, but more recently both microbial culture and culture-independent techniques have confirmed that human milk contains diverse communities of bacteria which are distinct from other microbial communities inhabiting the human body. The human milk microbiota which could be source of commensal, mutualistic, and potentially probiotic bacteria to the infant gut microbiota. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines \\"probiotics\\" as \\"living organisms which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host\\".  Occurrence  Graphic of bacterial phyla and 10 commonest genera in human milk Breast milk is a natural source of lactic acid bacteria for the newborn through breastfeeding, and may be considered a symbiotic food. The normal concentration of bacteria in milk from healthy women was about 103 colony- forming units (CFU) per milliliter. The milk's bacterial communities were generally complex. Among the hundreds of operational taxonomic units detected in the milk of every woman, only nine (Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Serratia, Pseudomonas, Corynebacterium, Ralstonia, Propionibacterium, Sphingomonas, and Bradyrhizobiaceae) were present in every sample from every woman, but an individual's milk bacterial community was generally stable over time. Human milk is a source of live Staphylococci, Streptococci, lactic acid bacteria, Bifidobacteria, Propionibacteria, Corynebacteria, and closely related Gram-positive bacteria for the infant gut.  Composition  Breast milk was considered to be free of bacteria until about the early 2000s, when lactic acid bacteria were first described in human milk hygienically collected from healthy women. Several studies have shown that there is a mother-to- infant transfer of bacterial strains belonging, at least, to the genera Lactobacillus, Staphylococcus, Enterococcus, and Bifidobacterium through breastfeeding, thus accounting for the close relationship of bacterial composition of the gut microbiota of breastfed infants with that found in the breast milk of their respective mothers. Research has also found that there are similarities between human milk and infant gut microbial flora, suggesting that dietary exposure, such as human milk probiotics, may have a contribution in supporting infant gut microbiota and immune development. Bacteria commonly isolated in human milk samples include Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Bacteroides, Clostridium, Micrococcus, Enterococcus, and Escherichia. Metagenomic analyses of human milk find it is dominated by Staphylococcus, Pseudomonas, and Edwardsiella. The human milk microbiome likely varies by population and between individual women, however, a study based on a group of U.S. women observed the same nine bacterial taxa in all samples from all of their participants, suggesting a common \\"core\\" of the milk microbiome, at least in that population. Bacterial communities of human colostrum have been reported as being more diverse than those found in mature milk. The three strains of Lactobacilli with probiotic properties that were isolated from breast milk were L. fermentum CECT5716, L. gasseri CECT5714, and L. salivarius CECT5713, with L. fermentum being one of the most abundant strains. Early administration of L. fermentum CECT5716 in infant formula is claimed to be safe and well tolerated for infants one to six months of age, and safe for long term use.  Origin  While the origins of the human milk microbiome are not exactly known, several hypotheses for its establishment have been proposed. Bacteria present in human milk may be derived from the surrounding breast skin flora, or the infant's oral cavity microbiota. Retrograde backflow during nursing or suckling may also lead to bacterial establishment in the mammary ducts, supported by the observation that a certain degree of flowback has been shown to occur during nursing using infrared photography. Alternatively, bacteria may be translocated to the mammary duct from the maternal gastrointestinal tract via an entero-mammary pathway, facilitated by dendritic cells.  Environmental factors  Several factors may influence the composition of human milk probiotics, such as maternal body mass index (BMI), infant sex, birth modality, and mode of breastfeeding. A study done by Soto et al also revealed that Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria are more commonly found in the human milk of women who did not receive any antibiotics during pregnancy and lactation. Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), a primary component of human milk, are prebiotics which have been shown to promote growth of beneficial Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides species. = Maternal health = Maternal health status is associated with changes in the bacterial composition of milk. Higher maternal BMI and obesity are associated with changes in the levels of Bifidobacterium and Staphylococcus species and overall lower bacterial diversity. Milk of women with celiac disease is observed to have reduced levels of Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium. Women who are HIV-positive show higher bacterial diversity and increased abundances of Lactobacillus in their milk than do non- HIV-positive women. Mastitis has been linked to changes in human milk microbiota at the phylum level, lower microbial diversity, and decreased abundance of obligate anaerobic taxa. Women delivering term and preterm show differences in their milk microbiome composition, with mothers of term-births showing lower abundances of Enterococcus species and higher amounts of Bifidobacterium species in their milk compared to mothers of preterm births. Few studies have been conducted examining the influence of maternal diet on the milk microbiome, but diet is known to influence other aspects of milk composition, such as the lipid profile, which in turn could affect its microbial composition. Variation in the fat and carbohydrate content of the maternal diet may influence the taxonomic composition of the milk microbiome. Both the taxonomic composition and diversity of bacteria present in human milk likely vary by maternal geographic location, however studies with more geographically diverse participants are needed to better understand variation between populations. Maternal perinatal antibiotic use is associated with changes in the prevalence of Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Staphylococcus, and Eubacterium in milk. Social network density of mother-infant dyads was found to be associated with increased bacterial diversity in the milk microbiome of mothers in the Central African Republic. = Delivery method = Mode of delivery may influence composition of the human milk microbiome. Vaginal births is associated with high taxonomic diversity and high prevalence of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus, and the opposite trend being seen with birth by caesarean section, however no relationship between delivery mode and the maternal milk microbiome has also been observed. = Lactation stage = The human milk microbiome varies across lactation stage, with higher microbial diversity observed in colostrum than in mature milk. Taxonomic composition of human milk also varies across the lactation period, initially dominated by Weissella, Leuconostoc, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Lactococcus species, and later composed primarily of Veillonella, Prevotella, Leptotrichia, Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, Bifidobacterium, and Enterococcus.  Influences on health  Breastfeeding is thought to be an important driver of infant gut microbiome establishment. The gut microbiome of breastfed infants is less diverse, contains higher amounts of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus species, and fewer potential pathogenic taxa than the gut microbiome of formula-fed infants. Human milk bacteria may reduce risk of infection in breastfed infants by competitively excluding harmful bacteria, and producing antimicrobial compounds which eliminate pathogenic strains. Certain Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria, the growth of which is stimulated by HMOs, contribute to healthy metabolic and immune-related functioning in the infant gut. =Benefits for breastfeeding mother = Research studies showed that L. fermentum could improve mastitis, a common inflammatory disease associated with lactation, by reducing the number of Streptococcus load which is believed to be the causal agent and risk factor of mastitis. = Benefit for infants = Breastfed children have a lower incidence of infections than formula-fed children, which could be mediated in part through modulation of the intestinal microflora by breast milk components. Indeed, breast-fed infants seem to develop a gut microflora richer in Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria with reduced pathogenic bacteria compared with formula-fed infants. Research, by Maldonado et al, found that infants receiving a follow- on formula enriched with L. fermentum demonstrated a reduction in gastrointestinal and respiratory infections, thus the administration of such formula may be useful for the prevention of community-acquired gastrointestinal and upper respiratory infections in infants. Human milk probiotics could also act as pioneering species to increase the colonization of ‚Äòbeneficial‚Äô bacteria and support the infant‚Äôs immature immune system. It is known that Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria can suppress the growth of pathogenic microorganisms such as Salmonella typhimurium and Clostridium perfringens by colonization of a child's intestine and competing for nutrients, thus preventing their adhesion. Intestinal colonization by commensal bacteria also plays a vital role in maintaining homeostasis of immune system. These bacteria stimulate the T helper 1 response and counteract the trend towards a T helper 2 response of neonatal immune system, which in turn reducing the incidence of the inflammatory processes such as necrotizing enterocolitis. Children with colic symptoms possibly have an imbalance in the intestinal microbiota ‚Äì analyses of faecal samples found higher counts of coliform bacteria and lower counts of Lactobacilli in infants with colic symptoms compared with children not suffering from colic. On the other hand, probiotics have been shown to influence intestinal motility and sensory neurons as well as contractile activity of the intestine and to exert anti- inflammatory effects.  Evolutionary implications  There is some indication of relationships between milk microbiota and other human milk components, including HMOs, maternal cells, and nutrient profiles. Specific bacterial genera have been shown to be associated with variation in levels of milk macronutrients such as lactose, proteins, and fats. HMOs selectively facilitate growth of particular beneficial bacteria, notably Bifidobacterium species. Furthermore, as Bifidobacteria genomes are uniquely equipped to metabolize HMOs, which are otherwise indigestible by enzymes of the infant gut, some have suggested a coevolution between HMOs and certain bacteria common in both the milk and infant gastrointestinal microbiomes. Furthermore, relative to other mammalian milks such as primate milk, human milk appears to be unique with respect to the complexity and diversity of its oligosaccharide repertoire. Human milk is typified by greater overall HMO diversity and predominance of oligosaccharides known to promote growth of Bifidobacterium in the infant gut. Milk microbiota are thought to play an essential role in programming the infant immune system, and tend to reduce the risk of adverse infant health outcomes. Differences in milk oligosaccharides between humans and non-human primates could be indicative of variation in pathogen exposure associated with increased sociality and group sizes. Together, these observations may indicate that milk microbial communities have coevolved with their human host, supported by the expectation that microbes which promote host health facilitate their own transmission and proliferation.  Comparisons with other mammals  Both human and macaque milks contains high abundances of Streptococcus and Lactobacillus bacteria, but differ in their respective relative abundances of these taxa. Bacteria observed to be most common in healthy bovine milk include Ralstonia, Pseudomonas, Sphingomonas, Stenotrophomonas, Psychrobacter, Bradyrhizobium, Corynebacterium, Pelomonas, Staphylococcus, Faecalibacterium, Lachnospiraceae, Propionibacterium, Aeribacillus, Bacteroides, Streptococcus, Anaerococcus, Lactobacillus, Porphyromonas, Comamonas, Fusobacterium, and Enterococcus.

The project was launched by the Podari Zhizn Foundation in 2010. Since 2018 regional stages of the Winners Games are held not only in Russia but in other countries as well.  Mission  The main purpose of the Winners Games is to help children who have overcome cancer get back to normal life and rehabilitate after the long battle with the disease. Project participants gain self-confidence, and learn that they are not different from other children, so they can lead the same active life they had led before, since sport is the very opposite of the disease. For many gravely ill children the dream to take part in the Winners Games gave an impetus for recovery. \\"When they are diseased, they think that it affects only them. But during such events children learn that everything can be overcome,\\" says Chulpan Khamatova, actress and founder of the Gift of Life foundation. For doctors and staff of the Gift of Life Foundation, the Games serve as a clear demonstration of success in battling cancer. Besides competitions that take place in strict conformity with the requirements of sports federations, the program includes all kinds of workshops, excursions, and concerts. In addition, the project draws the attention of philanthropists, sponsors, and volunteers to the problems of childhood cancer and rehabilitation.  Rules of conduct  Participation in athletic events of the Winners Games is open to children aged 7 to 16 years old who completed their treatment for an oncological disease. All participants are competing in six disciplines: track, swimming, table tennis, shooting, chess, and football in their respective age categories. There are no restrictions related to the physical fitness and sports training on the participation in the Winners Games, but a person may participate no more than twice. The Games Organizing Committee bares all expenses related to accommodation in Moscow, meals, transfer, sports equipment, entertainment and sightseeing programs. Participants cover only the cost of traveling to Moscow. Each child may be accompanied by one parent. In addition, the teams may include a doctor and a staff member of a charity foundation. Russian professional sports federations of all sports featured in the Games provide assistance with regard to organizing and hosting the competitions. Referees working on the project are internationally qualified and have worked at world sports championships.  Regional stages  Different countries and Russian regions hold regional stages, so that the maximum number of children who have survived cancer are able to take part in the Winners Games. The team that will go to the World Children's Winners Games in Moscow is selected from the participants of this stage. In 2018 regional stages will be held in 4 countries (Hungary, Bulgaria, Belarus, and Kazakhstan), as well as in 10 Russian regions (Belgorod, Nizhny Novgorod, Chelyabinsk, Kaliningrad, Orenburg, Perm, Rostov, Samara, Tver and Sverdlovsk Regions). Approximately 1,300 children will take part in sports competitions. In addition, nearly 30 Russian regions and 15 countries are forming teams to participate in the Winners Games without regional qualifying competitions. What is more, the Games Organizing Committee accepts requests from individual participants living in cities and countries that do not have regional stages.

He came from the minor aristocracy of Alsace and was son of a magistrate. At an early age he was made a senior administrator in the Council of State. He became bored with this work, resigned and became head of the colliery owner's association, whose interests he defended against other industries, the unions and the government. He became vice-president of the National Economic Council, and used that position to express his generally conservative views on social and industrial issues. He was in favour of paternalism and industrial cartels, and against state intervention. Early years 1871‚Äì1895 Henri Marie Joseph Hercule de Peyerimhoff de Fontenelle was born in Colmar, Alsace on 19 September 1871. His family originated in 14th century Alsace near the borders with Bavaria and Baden. The Catholic branch associated with Switzerland assumed the name \\"Peyerimhoff de Fontenelle\\" in the late 18th century. His grandfather Hercule Jean-Baptiste de Peyerimhoff (1809-1890) was head of the Colmar municipal council and did much to modernise the city. His father was Henri de Peyerimhoff (1838‚Äì1877), a magistrate and entomologist who specialized in microlepidoptera (smaller moths). After the Franco-Prussian War (1870), when Alsace became part of Germany his father chose to stay with France, and became judge of the civil court of Moulins in 1873, and then in Perpignan. He suffered from poor health and died in 1877. Henri de Peyerimhoff's mother, Mme. Bellaigue, took her two sons Henri and Paul to live with her family in Nancy. Henri de Peyerimhoff studied in Nancy at the Institution de la Malgrange, a religious college, where he met the future politician Louis Marin. He spent his holidays with his grandfather in Colmar. He was interested in mathematics and applied to enter the √âcole Polytechnique but was rejected on the grounds that his rib cage was too small for his height. He responded by choosing to study philosophy and law, and went with his brother Paul to the √âcole libre des sciences politiques, from which he graduated in the summer of 1893. He registered with the bar of Paris and began work as a lawyer, but did not like the work. In the spring of 1895 he heard that four places in the Conseil d'√âtat were open for competition, prepared for the examination under Jacques Tardieu of the √âcole libre, and was admitted. In April 1895 he was married in the cathedral of Moulins. Council of State 1895‚Äì1907 Peyerimhoff was auditor at the Conseil d'√âtat from 1895 to 1902, in the litigation section. The work was not particularly demanding. √âdouard Laferri√®re, Vice-President of the Conseil d‚ÄôEtat, was temporarily appointed Governor General of Algeria at a time when the colony was experiencing a wave of antisemitism and serious financial difficulties. He took Peyerimhoff as head of his civil cabinet, but in July 1900 Peyerimhoff was called back to Paris by Georges Coulon, the new Vice-President of the Conseil d‚ÄôEtat, and attached to the Interior section. Laferri√®re died, and in 1902 the new governor general of Algeria, Paul R√©voil, created the position of \\"director of economic services\\" for Peyerimhoff, who settled with his wife in Algiers in April 1902. R√©voil later resigned due to political disputes and was replaced by Charles Jonnart. Peyerimhoff prepared a huge survey of the results of colonization that was published in 1906. Coulon thought Peyerimhoff should remain in Algeria and proposed to appoint him Prefect of Constantine, but he refused and in 1905 returned to the Conseil d‚ÄôEtat where he was appointed Auditor First Class in the Legislation section. At the same time he retained an office in the Interior Ministry's Algerian Office, which caused an administrative conflict. He resigned from the Conseil d‚ÄôEtat as of May 1907, and was made honorary Ma√Ætre des requ√™tes. He continued to write about Algeria and paid tribute to people such as Eug√®ne √âtienne, Laferri√®re and R√©voil with whom he had worked. Later career 1907‚Äì40=Coal committee= Through his connections, and with the support of his maternal uncle Bellaigue, Peyerimhoff was appointed Secretary General of the Comit√© central des houill√®res de France (Central Committee of Coal Mines of France) in place of the engineer √âdouard Gruner, who now concentrated on technical subjects. The committee was an industry lobby group with a staff of eighteen in Paris. Peyerimhoff was then in turn secretary general, vice president and president of the committee, the coal owners cartel, until that committee was dissolved in 1940. He defended the collieries against electricity and steel interests. He was interested in subjects such as trade unionism, workers' housing, social care for workers' children and controlled recruitment of Polish workers for French mines. In 1928 he wrote favorably about collective agreements in an article on Le Program Patronal in the Revue des Vivants. As early as 1913 Peyerimhoff talked about the coal economy at the Mus√©e social and Semaines sociales de France(fr), and wrote about it in the Revue de Paris and Revue des deux Mondes. In the late 1920s Peyerimhoff and Ernest Mercier headed the French delegation in the Comit√© Franco-Allemand d'Information et de Documentation, which tried to defuse the tension caused by the French occupation of the Ruhr and create cooperation between French and German industry. The deliberately informal but influential committee met eight times between May 1926 and May 1930 to discuss industrial cooperation in Europe. In July 1931 Peyerimhoff offered his unreserved support for a Franco-German economic accord. =Business elite= Peyerimhoff was often seen as a symbol of big business, and as a former senior official exemplified the collusion between the state and capitalism. In 1929 Peyerimhoff was part of a consortium that included Fran√ßois de Wendel and Ren√©-Paul Duchemin that paid a high premium to purchase a majority share in Le Temps, hoping to prevent the liberal paper from falling into the wrong hands. The deal became public in 1931 and gave further proof to those who thought the press was controlled by the powerful. In 1936 Le Crapouillot said he sat on the boards of eighteen companies. In 1939 the Chaix directory listed ten councils to which he belonged: Cr√©dit national, Groupement des houill√®res du Nord et du Pas-de-Calais, Union des mines (President), Soci√©t√© de gestion d‚Äôint√©r√™ts miniers et industriels fran√ßais √† l‚Äô√©tranger (President), Union industrielle de cr√©dit pour la reconstitution, Compagnie g√©n√©rale d‚Äô√©lectricit√©, Soci√©t√© des Forces motrices de la Truy√®re (President), Compagnie des mines de potasse de Blodelsheim, Soci√©t√© houill√®re de Sarre et Moselle (President) and the Compagnie des phosphates de Constantine (President). Peyerimhoff has sometimes been accused of being a member of the Synarchy, but this seems exaggerated. Georges Valois identified Peyerimhoff as a member of an evil band of polytechniciens led by Jean Coutrot who had conspired against democracy, parliamentarianism and syndicalism since 1922 or 1923. Peyerimhoff did not always agree with other industry leaders, and Fran√ßois de Wendel accused him of being too close to radical leaders, but at other times he cooperated with Wendel. Peyerimhoff had been called \\"le gentleman du charbon\\" and a fonctionnaire patronal, but after being dismissed in 1940 he lost his influence in the coal industry. =Political views= Peyerimhoff was a member of the newly formed National Economic Council (CNE) from 1925, and Vice-President of the CNE from 1926 after the death of Robert Pinot. He defended the social policies of the colliery owners in the 1926 report of the National Economic Council. Peyerimhoff used his position in the CNE to give his views on a range of social and economic issues. He was in favour of industrial cartels but against the onerous controls on industry demanded by the General Confederation of Labour (CGT). He saw America as the model rather than the USSR. On behalf of the coal owners Peyerimhoff formally endorsed the corporatist Redressement Fran√ßais at the closing session in the amphitheatre of the Sorbonne of its National Congress of Metropolitan and Colonial Organization in April 1927. Peyerimhoff thought that unlike massive German conglomerates such as IG Farben the French model of industrial ententes let the member companies retain their identities and continue to compete to some extent. He observed that, \\"The state of 1850 was a legal and military entity. The state of 1930 is, above all, an economic apparatus. Although he was not a follower of Henri de Saint-Simon, Peyerimhoff thought the political structure of France needed basic change because politicians were no longer able to handle the problems of the modern economy. Among other ideas he thought the Senate should be restructured into an assembly that represented the different economic groups. During the Great Depression Peyerimhoff backed the F√©d√©ration r√©publicaine, the party of the \\"classic right\\". He seems to have moved further to the right after the triumph of the Popular Front in 1936. Police reports said he tried to buy Fran√ßois de La Rocque's Parti social fran√ßais and bought Jacques Doriot's Parti populaire fran√ßais. In 1938 Peyerimhoff and Louis Renault supported Georges Bonnet in opposing an intensive rearmament policy, which they thought would harm the economy. Last years 1940‚Äì53 Peyerimhoff, who opposed state intervention, does not seem to have played any important role during World War II (1939‚Äì45). The Comit√© central des houill√®res de France was dissolved by decree on 9 November 1940, as was the Comit√© des forges. He wrote in his memoirs that nationalized industries generally preferred \\"the spectacular and the expensive\\" to \\"the efficient and profitable\\". In October 1944 he wrote to Charles de Gaulle urging him not to nationalize the coal mines, but his plea was ignored. After the war the mines were nationalized. In 1952 he was elected a free member of the Acad√©mie des Sciences Morales et Politiques. Henri de Peyerimhoff died in Paris on 21 July 1953 aged 81.

She was a pioneer suffragist in California and served as president of the Los Angeles Equal Suffrage Association. During the various suffrage campaigns, McComas contributed articles to over seventy newspapers and magazines, and she was well known throughout the west as an educator and lecturer. She was accredited with being the first woman to conduct a department for women in a daily paper in California, and the first woman to address a state Republican ratification meeting. She was one of the earliest organizers of the Free Kindergarten Association and of clubs for working women, and was prominent in many movements for civic welfare. She was Associate Editor of The Household Journal of California and author of several books, among them The Women of the Canal Zone and Under the Peppers. McComas contributed travel sketches to many magazines. Early life and education Alice Moore was born in Paris, Illinois, June 18, 1850. Her father, the Gen. Jesse Hale Moore, scholar, clergyman, soldier and statesman, who died while serving his government as United States Consul in Callao, Peru, was at the time of her birth, president of the Paris academy. He came of an old Virginia family whose ancestors were noted for their participation in the wars of 1776 and 1812. Her mother, Rachel (Hines) Moore, a native of Kentucky, was a daughter of one of Kentucky's prominent families, which included the clergyman, William H. Thompson, and the Indiana jurist, John W. Thompson. From both sides of her family, she inherited literary taste. From the age of eight, she had her own opinions on social and religious questions, and often astonished her elders with profound questionings, which brought upon her the name of \\"peculiar\\". Her aggressiveness as she became older, in clinging to those opinions, even when very unpopular, added to that the opprobrium, \\"self-willed and headstrong.\\" During the Civil War, in which nearly all the male relatives and friends, including her future husband, had enlisted for the defense of the Union, she commenced the study of politics. At that time, she read of the woman's rights movement. While she had not the courage openly to advocate a thing considered and pronounced \\"unwomanly\\" by many in her circle, her nature rebelled against the inequality of the sexes. In school, she traded compositions for worked-out mathematical problems, averaging many terms from six to ten compositions weekly on as many different subjects, changing her style so as to escape detection. At fifteen, her ambition to achieve something over-ruled her better judgment, for, thinking there was little opportunity for a Methodist minister's daughter, her father being then presiding elder of the Decatur, Illinois, District, to make more of herself or to see the world, she left home one Sunday evening, ostensibly to attend church, but in fact to take the train for St. Louis to make her own fortune. There she immediately secured a situation in a dry goods store at a week. After one delightful week of complete freedom and self-reliance, she was persuaded to give up her situation and her dream of fighting the world alone and single-handed. Much against her will, she returned and resumed her home life with a feeling of disappointment from which she never entirely recovered, for she inwardly rebelled against the stereotyped, formal and empty life a girl in her social position was compelled to live. Her main solace was in writing stories and poems, many of which were destroyed as soon as written. Others she sent secretly and anonymously to papers and magazines. Her education was finished at Saint Mary-of-the-Woods College, special honors in music and literary composition, prize winner in elocution. Career After leaving school, she attended to the social duties required of a family in a prominent position, her father at that time being the representative in Congress of the seventh congressional district of Illinois. In Decatur, Illinois, on November 14, 1870, she married Judge Charles C. McComas, and for the next five years she devoted herself to the duties of wife, mother and housekeeper. Their children were: Helen (1872-1891); Alice Beach (b. 1876), Clare (b. 1881); and Carroll (b. 1886). Financial disaster consequent on the panic of 1876 took away their home and property. Her husband, believing that he could quickly retrieve his lost fortune in a new place, emigrated to Kansas, where his wife and family, consisting of two daughters, joined him in 1877. She there resumed writing, which brought her a small income, but she concealed her identity under a pen name when writing for fiction and poetry. After her removal to Los Angeles, California, in 1887, she began to write over her own name. She edited, with occasional interruptions, a woman's department in the Los Angeles Evening Express. During 1891 and 1893, she filled the position of vice-president of the National Woman Suffrage Association, first vice-president of the Ladies' Annex to the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce, and member of the board of directors of the Women's Educational and Industrial Union. During her term as president of the California suffrage society, the first county suffrage convention was held in the state. She secured the promise of a land donation for a public park in her neighborhood, on condition that the city would improve it, and took the matter before the city council, urging that body in a stirring speech to accept the gift, and by diligent and persistent work, finally securing an appropriation of . McComas contributed to over 70 newspapers on the suffrage question; originated the \\"Precinct\\" idea in woman suffrage campaigning; and wrote a brochure, \\"The Timely Question\\", on the same subject. She was a correspondent for three California papers during the World's Fair, and was a special contributor of travel sketches in the Los Angeles Times and various magazines. She completed a book on child life in California, Under the Peppers; was a writer of short stories, articles on politics and economics; and served as associate editor of the Pacific Household Journal. She occasionally addressed a public audience. Her lecturers included topics of, Politics in the Home, Individual Education in the Public Schools, and The Common Sense Rearing of Children. She made a tour of thorough investigation at the Panama Canal; lectured on that subject in 1914; and published a book, The Women of the Canal Zone. Personal life McComas was a member of the American Play-goers; Ethical Society; Woman's Press Association, San Francisco; California Club of New York; and the Friday Morning Club, Los Angeles. For several years, she lived at 440 Riverside Drive, New York City with her daughter Carroll, an actress, but when the latter went abroad as an entertainer with the A. E. F., McComas returned to California where she resumed active management of her ranch in San Dimas. When she was taken sick in the summer of 1919, her daughter who had just returned from overseas, joined her, and a few weeks later, when recovery began to seem uncertain, her eldest daughter, Mrs. Alice Gray of Brooklyn was sent for. McComas died December 19, 1919, at the Los Angeles Hospital of complications following an attack of acute indigestion.

History Earlier there was the Moscow City Bratsky (Fraternal) Cemetery on the place of the park. The cemetery was founded in 1915 by the Grand Duchess Elizabeth Feodorovna. Almost 18,000 victims of the World War I were buried in the cemetery. In 1918 the Church of the Transfiguration was built here by the prominent architect Alexey Shchusev. In 1925 the Fraternal Cemetery was closed for burials. In 1932 it was turned into a park. All the tombstones, with the exception of one, were demolished. In the late 1940s the Church of the Transfiguration was demolished too. At the same time some blocks of buildings were built in the east part of the former cemetery. A cinema \\"Leningrad\\" and two cafes were built in the park later. During perestroika many public figures spoke out for the revival of the memorial in the park, set on the site of the Moscow City Fraternal Cemetery. The Chapel of the Transfiguration was built there in 1998. In 2004 the park got the name \\"Memorial park complex of the heroes of the First World War\\" and some monuments were erected there.

Education and early career  Hogan graduated Harvard University in 1988 with a bachelor's degree in applied mathematics and economics. She went to work for Oracle Corporation, first as a software developer, then as a software development manager. In 1992, she left Oracle to earn an MBA from Stanford Graduate School of Business in 1994, then used it as a management consultant for consulting firm McKinsey & Company until 2003.  Microsoft  Microsoft was one of Hogan's clients at McKinsey, and she was hired by Kevin Johnson in 2003. In 2005, she became the Corporate Vice President of Customer Service and Support and in 2009, the Corporate Vice President of Microsoft Worldwide Services, which includes customer service, enterprise support and consulting with 20,000+ employees. That year the Profiles in Diversity Journal put her on its annual \\"Women Worth Watching\\" list. In November 2014, Hogan was appointed to executive vice president for Human Resources, replacing Lisa Brummel. Although Hogan had never worked in HR before, she says her experience in leading the Worldwide Services division focused on attracting and retaining the best talent. Her diverse combination of experience, in technical, sales, and service, gave her credibility within the company. As Chief People Officer, her primary goal was to support the change in the company culture led by new CEO Satya Nadella, from a \\"fixed mindset\\" of competition, and trying to be the smartest person, to a \\"growth mindset\\" of learning, cooperation, diversity, and inclusion. The \\"mindset\\" methodology comes from the work of Stanford University psychology professor Carol Dweck. Dweck visited Microsoft in May 2016, met with Hogan and others, and was favorably impressed: unlike some other Fortune 500 companies that \\"give lip service to growth mind-set\\", Dweck says, \\"I could see that they understood it deeply.\\" In October 2016 Dweck and Hogan wrote an article together on how Microsoft uses growth mindset for Harvard Business Review. In 2014, as one of her first actions as Chief People Officer, Hogan sat down with human resource leads from rival companies, including Laszlo Bock from Google, and Denise Young Smith from Apple, Inc., to discuss the goal of increasing diversity in the technology industry. The collaborative meetings continued including HR leads from Intel, and Washington State companies outside the technology industry such as Starbucks and Costco. Also online as In further efforts to expand corporate diversity and inclusion, Hogan expanded parental leave benefit to all parents, including fathers, in 2015, and introduced a four-week paid family caregiver leave in 2017, making Microsoft one of the only companies to offer such a benefit worldwide. Hogan says these benefits are also personal for her, as she remembers the support she needed from her Services team when she was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2007.  Boards and honors  Hogan serves on the boards of directors of the National Center for Women & Information Technology, which works to increase women's participation in computing, and of the Puget Sound region Susan G. Komen breast cancer organization. Hogan also joined the Board of Alaska Airlines in August 2019. She is a former executive board member of the Technology Services Industry Association. In 2015, Hogan was recognized as a \\"Woman of Influence\\" by the Puget Sound Business Journal. In 2016, she was named to the \\"Top 50 Most Powerful Women in Technology\\" list by Yahoo! and the National Diversity Council.  Personal life  Hogan was born and raised in southeast Wisconsin: Wauwatosa, Brookfield, and Pewaukee.She graduated from Brookfield Central High School in 1984. She has one son, born in 2002.

The other two who defended Piso were Marcus Aemilius Lepidus and Lucius Calpurnius Piso.Annales, III.11 Despite their efforts, and the support of the emperor Tiberius, the case went against Piso and he committed suicide before the Senate could hold a vote on the verdict.Annales, III.15 Tactius mentions another Livineius Regulus, whose expulsion from the Senate he had recounted in one of the lost sections of his Annales. This Livineius Regulus had staged a gladiator show at Pompeii in the year 59, where the townspeople of Pompeii attacked a number of inhabitants of the neighboring town of Nuceria. Emperor Nero referred the matter to the Senate, who first tried to hand it off to the consuls, but in the end punished Pompeii with a 10-year ban on similar public gatherings, and having all of their guild associations dissolved. Further, this Regulus was punished with exile, apparently from Italy.Annales, XIV.17 While it is doubtful that they are the same person, how Livineius Regulus the consul is related to Livineius Regulus the ex-Senator is uncertain.

The Vita version was released in Japan on November 19, 2015, and the English version was released internationally for Steam on July 18, 2016. Overview The story follows two siblings turned into cats, who explore a vast 2D world on an airship in pursuit of the witch who transformed them, and to save the island of Laputa. The game is unique in several ways: it is cited in the official trailer as the first sandbox RPG from Japan, owing influence primarily to Terraria. This shows the western indie scene's burgeoning influence on the Japanese industry, whereas it had previously been the opposite before the west gained dominance in the gaming world. The Vita version is also one of the few retail imports to offer an official English patch, which is available to importers who have access to PlayStation Network. The game automatically displays the text in several languages, based on whatever the system's regional settings, if there is a translation for said region. Therefore, if someone from the US or UK region has downloaded the patch, it should display text in English by default, so long as the system's region is defined as such. Lastly, it is compatible with PSTV, putting it in stark contrast with Terraria, which did not offer this because of its touch-screen controls exclusive to the Vita.

The Force was formed in 1960, and integrated into the Republic of Vietnam Navy (RVNN) in 1965. The genesis of the Coastal Force dates to April 1960, when Admiral Harry D. Felt, Commander in Chief, U.S. Pacific Command (CINCPAC), recommended that the RVNN assume a larger role in curbing the flow of enemy supplies coming into South Vietnam from the sea. Partly because of this recommendation, President Ngo Dinh Diem established the Coastal Force, often referred to as the \\"junk force\\", as an autonomous unit directly under South Vietnam‚Äôs Department of State for National Defense. The idea of a coastal force as a paramilitary unit fit in well with the Kennedy administration's belief that self-defense units represented one of the best means of fighting the Viet Cong (VC) insurgency. Consequently, the administration ordered the Defense Department to support the new force by funding the construction of 501 junks by South Vietnamese shipyards. The original plan for the Coastal Force, written by RVNN Commander H·ªì T·∫•n Quy·ªÅn, called for 420 sailing junks and 63 motorized junks, manned by 2,200 civilian irregulars drawn from local fishing villages, to patrol the inshore coastal waters up to from the coast. Quy·ªÅn hoped that his force would blend in naturally with coastal fishing junks, allowing his units to keep their true identity secret until they drew up to a suspect junk for a search and boarding mission. The plan called for creating 21 junk divisions (also known as coastal divisions), each with 23 junks. Every division would patrol a stretch of the South Vietnamese coastline, and their operations would be coordinated by radio from coastal command surveillance centers. Coastal divisions, in turn, reported to one of four VNN coastal districts. These districts were headquartered in Danang (I), Nha Trang (II), Vung Tau (III) and An Thoi (IV), and each district commander controlled all naval forces operating within his district. On 16 October 1963, the advisory team persuaded the RVNN to create four naval zone commands, from the 1st Naval Zone in the north to the 4th Naval Zone in the Gulf of Thailand. Thereafter, an overall commander whose area of responsibility now corresponded with that of an army corps commander controlled operations of the Sea Force, River Force and Coastal Force in a particular zone. By the end of 1963, the junk force had grown to 632 junks and 3,700 civilian crewmembers. From its inception, however, problems beset the fledgling organization. Recruiting sailors for the new force proved more difficult than expected. Vietnamese fishermen made an adequate living from the sea during this period and had little interest in joining the junk force. The RVNN instead recruited urban peasants and refugees from the north. With no seafaring tradition, these northerners were prone to leave or desert the service at first opportunity. Enlistments rarely kept up with attrition, which averaged over 106 sailors per month during 1963‚Äì1964. Desertion and absent- without-leave rates also were high due to the deplorable conditions under which these men served. A February 1963 survey of the men in the Fourth Coastal District found that over 500 of the 657 men on duty in the unit had not received any pay in the past six months, and none had ever received any formal training. \\"Many men on the junks at this time had never fired a gun or been on a junk before... Needless to say, morale was non-existent and approximately 50 men per week were deserting.‚Äù A 1964 study by the Naval Advisory Group Saigon confirmed these observations, stating that the root cause of the problem was poor pay and benefits for junk force sailors.Not only were these men paid meager wages, but commands rarely received funds for messing, berthing, and basic medical care for the sailors. In a medical survey of Junk Division 33 in 1963, one advisor found that over 50 percent of the junkmen had some type of treatable disease. Many illnesses resulted from unsanitary water because his coastal division lacked funds for water treatment tablets (iodine). Only 30 percent of the junkmen had received a tetanus shot and just 15 percent, regular doses of chloroquine, a malaria prophylaxes. Wooden junks required much more maintenance than planned because they were prone to infestations of marine worms and rot. A RVNN/USN survey conducted in May 1964 found that 174 junks were sidelined for repairs, and 64 others were beyond repair. In the Fourth Coastal District, 98 of the 121 junks were out of commission because of maintenance problems. The Vietnamese government deserved much of the blame for these problems because it tended to fund continued expansion of the force at the expense of maintenance for existing units, but lack of regular preventative maintenance on the part of the naval units was also to blame. Operationally, the work of the junk force was not only tedious but dangerous. Motorized VC junks often out-sailed and out-gunned the force‚Äôs many sailing junks; their wooden hulls offered little protection from VC bullets. In the shallow waters of canals and tributaries, junks often could not follow the smaller VC sampans. Several attempts to augment the junk patrols with Republic of Vietnam Air Force (RVNAF) surveillance aircraft foundered because of the unavailability of aircraft and communications difficulties between aircraft and junks. In spite of its many problems, the junk force generated impressive statistics. During 1963 alone, the Coastal Force and the Sea Force, a deepwater force of larger vessels, checked 127,000 junks and 353,000 fishermen. Additionally, the Coastal Force detained 2,500 VC suspects, and the Sea Force, another 500. Following the V≈©ng R√¥ Bay incident in February 1965 when a North Vietnamese long steel-hulled freighter manage to slip through RVNN‚Äôs coastal patrols and it took the RVNN (with Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) and RVNAF support) over four days to secure the area and seize the ship‚Äôs goods, a report on the RVNN found that the Junk Force's personnel were \\"by and large, illiterate,\\" operating \\"under the most difficult living conditions and on an extremely austere basis.\\" In addition to suffering nearly constant maintenance problems, the force‚Äôs inadequate wooden junks could not pursue the faster motorized junks, not to mention steel trawlers like Ship 145. Many of the Junk Division bases also were situated in VC-dominated areas with little or no local security forces. Lines of communication within the force were \\"almost negligible.\\" In 1965, the state of the coastal junk force was worse. Although this force patrolled the vital inner barrier of the Operation Market Time blockade and was responsible for controlling vast stretches of the coastline, it was in many respects the weakest link in the chain. On average, less than 40 percent of the force was on patrol at any given time with the remaining 60 percent either undergoing repairs or inoperative due to manpower shortages, base defense requirements, or lack of aggressiveness. North of Vung Tau, the VC controlled approximately of the coastline and south of that town, of the coast. In many instances the Coastal Force bases were little more than government islands in a sea of hostile territory. At the beginning of 1965, the Coastal Force consisted of 526 junks assigned to 28 Coastal Force divisions spread out along the entire coast of South Vietnam. The force included 81 command, 90 motor-sail, 121 motor-only, and 234 sail-only junks. The command junks were relatively capable vessels. Armed with one .50-caliber and two .30-caliber machine guns, these junks could reach a maximum speed of 12 knots‚Äîmore than adequate to intercept similar vessels used by the VC. The sail-only junks, on the other hand, were more of a liability than an asset. Their small three- to five-man crews carried nothing but small arms and had no hope of stopping motorized blockade runners. Beginning in 1964 the Naval Advisory Group recommended that all of these junks be stricken from the fleet; 134 were retired during 1965, with the remainder scheduled to go in early 1966. To replace them, the Saigon Naval Shipyard built 90 \\"Yabuta\\" junks during 1965. Mr. Yabuta, a Japanese engineer at the Saigon Naval Shipyard in 1961, originally designed the junk. Armed with a .30-caliber machine gun, it featured a 110-horsepower diesel engine capable of generating ten knots of speed and was built entirely out of fiberglass, which obviated the need to treat the hulls for wood-boring Teredo worms. Wooden junks, by contrast, needed to have their hulls scraped, blow-torched and resealed every three months. The U.S. Military Assistance Program provided funds for building materials and engines, and the Vietnamese paid the wages of the shipyard laborers who built the junks. After the first Yabutas were completed, output slowed significantly. In 1966 the Saigon Naval Shipyard built only nine junks and in 1967, just 15. Production went from three junks a week in 1965 to one every five weeks in 1967 as private construction firms lured shipyard workers away with salaries, on average, three times higher than what the government had paid them. Between 28 March and 17 April 1965 Task Force 71 reported 14,962 junks in its area of operation. Forty percent of these were within of the South Vietnamese coast, and the remaining 60 percent between 3 and from the coastline. The RVNN inspected 2.5 percent of the former contacts and 7 percent of the latter. Clearly, the Coastal Force could not keep up with the flow of contacts being reported by TF 71 units. Of the 530 junks assigned to Market Time from the Coastal Force, only 33.7 percent were utilized in patrols during this same period, and only half of the 44 assigned Sea Force ships participated. In a report to the Chief of Naval Operations, Vice Admiral Paul P. Blackburn, the United States Seventh Fleet commander, summarized the situation as follows: \\"The VNN Coastal and Sea Forces effort in Market Time Operations has degenerated to the point where it is effectively non-existent. . . . We must recognize that this US/VNN anti-infiltration chain is no stronger than its weakest link.\\" Ultimately, some of the problems with the Coastal Force were alleviated by integrating it into the regular navy in July 1965, but the sorry state of the service as a whole continued throughout 1965. By 1967 the Coastal Force consisted of 27 coastal groups located at 22 sites spread out along the coast of South Vietnam. Each base consisted of approximately 10 junks and 148 sailors. The men, most of whom had just a few years of grade school education, lived in primitive conditions far from the comforts of larger towns or cities.

On 27 February 2017, she was officially appointed director of the Mus√©e d'Orsay by the then French President Fran√ßois Hollande.  Honours  Laurence des Cars is the chevalier of the Legion of Honour and National Order of Merit, officer of Arts and letters.  In 1848, during the reign of Queen Victoria, English painting, had been bogged down in the convention. The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, by radically innovative aesthetic choices, would bring it back to life. John Everett Millais, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, and William Holman Hunt are the original members of this Brotherhood. They claimed a freedom and authenticity that they felt painting had lost since academicism has regarded Raphael as a model. Supported by art critic John Ruskin, who was the voice of modernity at the time, this group of young people‚Äîthey were only 20 years old‚Äîtook inspiration from the medieval art, just like the neo-Gothic architects did before them. Their works reflect both a sense of nature and a social concern. The second generation of artists of this Brotherhood, led by Edward Burne- Jones and William Morris, applied their principles to the decor, furniture, and illustrated books, influencing 'Symbolist Europe' through their imaginary. Laurence des Cars, chronicler of this artistic story of rebellion, retraces its history in this small 1999 volume, entitled (lit. 'The Pre-Raphaelites: An English Modernism'; English-language edition ‚Äì The Pre-Raphaelites: Romance and Realism), published by √âditions Gallimard in its series of the collection. The book is illustrated with 125 illustrations, 95 in colour, and has five chapters: I, 'A Victorian Rebellion'; II, 'Avant-Garde Archaism (1848‚Äì51)'; III, 'Individual Destinies (1852‚Äì6)'; IV, 'Artistic Careers' (1857‚Äì70); V, 'Towards Symbolism (1871‚Äì98)'. These are followed by a 'Documents' section containing the opinions and attitudes from the contemporaries of Pre- Raphaelites, and is divided into five parts: 1, Controversy and misunderstanding; 2, Artist poets; 3, The everyday life of a Pre-Raphaelite; 4, Critical views, 5, Rediscovery. The book also includes a further readings list, list of museums, list of illustrations, index of works by artist, and a general index. It has been translated into English, Japanese, and Russian.

Biography and career Sch√∂nenberger studied electrical engineering and obtained his degree in 1979. While working as an engineer in a research lab at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, he became interested in natural science and studied physics, obtaining his diploma from the institute in 1986. As a graduate student, he worked under the supervision of Heinrich Rohrer (Nobel laureate in 1986) and S. Alvarado at the IBM Research Laboratory at R√ºschlikon and received his PhD in physics with a thesis on magnetic force microscopy in 1990. He then joined the Philips Research Laboratories at Eindhoven in the Netherlands as a postdoctoral fellow and later as a permanent staff member. In 1995 he was appointed full professor (of experimental physics) at the University of Basel, where he heads the Nanoelectronics Group and is currently directing the Swiss Nanoscience Institute and the Swiss-NSF center on Nanoscale Science and Technology. Research After his early work on magnetic force microscopy, Sch√∂nenberger then used different force microscopy techniques to study single charges and, in particular, single electron tunneling. He studied electron transport in quantum wires and shot noise and noise reduction in electron transport. Subsequently, he and his group studied transport in increasingly smaller natural and engineered nanoscale devices operating in the quantum regime. These include quasi one-dimensional objects such as quantum wires, carbon nanotubes, and DNA-molecules or two-dimensional graphene. In 1999 he published three of his most-cited and most impactful papers that report key experiments in nanoelectronics. He demonstrated electronic quantum interference by measuring the Aharonov-Bohm effect in multi-walled carbon nanotubes and by realizing the quantum optical Hanbury Brown and Twiss effect for the first time with electrons and demonstrated the anti-bunching effects arising from their fermionic statistics and he demonstrated electron transport through DNA molecules. In particular, he and his group are a leader in the study of electronic properties of \\"hybrid\\" devices, that combine normal metals with superconductors and ferromagnetic elements. The latter introduce by the proximity effect non-trivial correlations such as a pairing or exchange field. This can give rise to new correlated many-body quantum states. Examples are topological states, molecular Andreev-bound states and Majorana-like states.

Soil aggregate stability is a measure of soil structure (Six et al., 2000a) and can be impacted by soil management (Six et al., 1998).  Overview = Why is aggregate stability important? = Aggregate stability is one of indicators of soil quality, as it combines soil physical, chemical, and biological properties (Doran & Parkin, 1996). The formation of soil aggregates (or so-called secondary soil particles or peds) occurs due to interactions of primary soil particles (i.e., clay) through rearrangement, flocculation and cementation. Aggregate stability has a direct impact on soil pore size distribution, which affects soil water retention and water movement in soil, therefore affecting air movement. A soil with good soil structure typically has a mix of micro-, meso-, and macropores. Therefore, with more aggregation, you would expect to have a higher total porosity compared to a poorly aggregated soil (Nimmo, 2004Nimmo, J.R., 2004, Porosity and Pore Size Distribution, in Hillel, D., ed. Encyclopedia of Soils in the Environment: London, Elsevier, v. 3, p. 295-303.). Micropores are important for water retention and storage in soils, while macro- and mesopores allow for the movement of water and air into the soil. A well aerated soil is important for plant and microbial health. Without access to oxygen, plant roots and aerobic microorganisms are unable to respire, and can die. To have a high biodiversity of soil organisms it is important to have a mix of different pore sizes and habitats in the soil (Trivedi, 2018). Soil pores create space in the soil that allows for root penetrability. In a compacted soil with few aggregates and limited pore spaces, roots have difficulty growing and may be excluded from nutrients and water stored in different parts of the soil. Soils with good aggregate stability typically have a higher water infiltration rate, allowing more water into the soil profile faster, and are not susceptible to water ponding.  Factors affecting aggregate formation  Soil aggregates are formed due to flocculation and cementation processes, and are enhanced by physical and biological processes. Primary soil particles (sand, silt, and clay) are subjected to these processes, and can stick together to form larger sub-microaggregates (< 250 Œºm), microaggregates, and macroaggregates (> 250 Œºm). It has been suggested that soil aggregates form hierarchically, meaning larger less dense aggregates are composed of smaller more dense aggregates (Kay, 1990; Oades, 1993). = Flocculation = Flocculation refers to a state when primary soil particles (sand, silt, and clay) are drawn to each other by inter-particle forces to create microscopic floccules (or clumps). Inter- particle forces include: van der Waals forces, electrostatic forces, and hydrogen bonding. This is the opposite of dispersion, which occurs when individual primary soil particles are held apart. Soil particle dispersion and flocculation are mainly controlled by the soil pHhttp://soilweb200.landfood.ubc.ca/interactions-among-soil-components/4-soil- acidity/, electrical conductivity (EC), and sodium content. = Cementation = Microscopic floccules, will become aggregates once they are stabilized through cementation by one or several cementing agents such as carbonates, gypsum, sesquioxides, clay particles, and organic matter (Tisdall & Oades, 1982).  Carbonates and Gypsum  Calcium carbonate (CaCO3), magnesium carbonate (MgCO3), and gypsum (CaSO4.2H2O) can enhance soil aggregation when associated with clay minerals. The calcium ion (Ca2+), through its cationic bridging effect on flocculation of clay and organic matter compounds, has a crucial role in the formation and stability of soil aggregates. Calcium can exchange with sodium on exchange sites. This, in turn, reduces soil particle dispersion, surface crusting, and aggregate slaking associated with sodic soils and indirectly increase aggregate stability (Nadler et al., 1996).  Sesquioxides  Tisdall and Oades (1982) found that iron and aluminum hydrous oxides (or sesquioxides) can act as a cementing agents to form aggregates >100 Œºm, this effect becomes more pronounced in soil containing >10% sesquioxides. Sesquioxides act as stabilizing agents for aggregates because iron and aluminum in solution act as flocculants (i.e., bridging cations between negatively charged soil particles), and sesquioxides have potential to precipitate as gel on clay particles (Am√©zketa, 1999).  Clay Particles  Soil clay particles have varying effects on aggregate formation, depending on its type. Soil with 2:1 type of phyllosilicate clay minerals (e.g., montmoriollinite) typically have high cation exchange capacity (CEC), which allows them to bind with polyvalently charged organic matter complexes to form microaggregates (Am√©zketa, 1999). Soil organic matter is therefore the main binding agent in these soils (Six et al., 2000a). On the other hand, in soils with oxides and 1:1 type of phyllosiliacte clay minerals (e.g., kaolinite), soil organic matter is not the only binding agent and aggregate formation is also due to electrostatic charges between and among oxides and kaolinite particles. Therefore, in these soils, aggregation is less pronounced (Six et al., 2000a).  Soil Organic Matter  Soil organic matter can increase aggregate stability in soil, and can be classified based on how it is incorporated in soil aggregates in to: # transient (polysaccharides fraction of soil organic matter), # temporary (fungal hyphae and plant roots), and # persistent (resistant aromatic compounds that are associated with polyvalent metal cations and strongly adsorbed polymers). Temporary organic matter stabilizes macroaggregates (> 250 Œºm), while transient and persistent organic matter stabilizes microaggregates (Am√©zketa, 1999). Soil or ganic matter‚Äôs role in aggregate stability can be difficult to determine, due to several reasons: # only part of the total soil organic matter plays a role in aggregate stability, # there is a threshold of soil organic matter, above which aggregate stability cannot be improved by addition of organic matter, and # organic matter is not the primary binding agent in that particular soil. = Physical Processes = Wetting and Drying  Soil wetting and drying cycles can have both a beneficial effect on soil aggregation (Utomo and Dexter, 1982; Dexter et al., 1988), and a negative effect on soil aggregation (Soulides and Allison, 1961; Tisdall et al., 1978). To help explain these contradictory results, it was hypothesized that soils will maintain a state of aggregate stability equilibrium. If soils have certain properties, a threshold level will be reached where a period of wetting and drying will lead to increases or decreases in aggregate stability depending on the aggregate stability of the soil at that point in time.  Shrinking and Swelling  Shrinking and swelling cycles of soil are closely linked with wetting and drying cycles; however, they are also dependent on the type of clay phyllosilicate minerals present. Soils with higher content of 2:1 types of phyllosilicate minerals (such as montmoriolinite), have a stronger cementation force acting during repeated wetting and drying cycles, which can increase soil aggregate stability (Am√©zketa, 1999). This is because 2:1 type phyllosilicate minerals swell and increase their volume with changing water content; meaning these soils expand when wet, and contract as they dry out. Through repeated shrinking and swelling action, soil aggregation occurs because of the rearrangement of soil particles due to the stress of increasing soil-water suction (Kay, 1990). Some soils even have the ability to ‚Äúself- mulch‚Äù, meaning a desirable granular structure is formed at the surface of the soil due to the shrinking and swelling nature of the soil particles (Grant & Blackmore, 1991).  Freezing and Thawing  When soils freeze and thaw, they undergo expansion and contraction. It was found that with higher water content in the soil at the time of freezing had a reducing effect on aggregate stability overall. The water expands in these soils and breaks apart the aggregates into smaller aggregates, while pores created by the freezing collapse once soils thaw (Am√©zketa, 1999). = Soil Biological Factors = Soil biological processes are most important in soils that do not have 2:1 phyllosilicate clay minerals, and are therefore lacking in shrinking and swelling properties that can aid in structural formation (Oades, 1993). Soil organisms can have an indirect and direct effects on soil structure at different levels of aggregate formation. Macrooaggregates (>2000 Œºm) are held together by plant roots and fungal hyphae, mesoaggregates (20-250 Œºm) are held together by a combination of cementing agents including: sesquioxides and persistent organic matter, and microaggregates (2-20 Œºm) are held together persistent organic bonds (Tisdall & Oades, 1982). Soil fauna mix soil particles with organic matter to create close associations with one another.  Soil Fauna  Earthworms, termites, and ants are some of the most important invertebrates that are capable of having an effect on soil structure (Lee & Foster, 1991). When earthworms ingest soil mineral and organic components, they can increase the structural stability of that soil through increased carbon-mineral associations and formation of casts, which increase aggregate stability (Tisdall & Oades, 1982; Oades 1993). Some earthworms are able to create stable microaggregates by flocculation of Ca2+ ions during digestion (Shiptalo & Protz, 1989). Some microarthropods, including mites and collembola, although they are small, because there are large numbers of them, they are able to improve soil structure. These organisms are often associated with forest ecosystems, and can improve soil structure through the production of fecal pellets, from ingestion of a mixture of humic materials and plant debris (Lee & Foster, 1991).  Fungi and Plant Roots  Tisdall and Oades (1982) found that roots and fungal hyphae are important factors in aggregate formation. They are considered a temporary aggregate binding agent, and are typically associated with early stages of aggregate formation. Roots can act as a binding agent themselves, and can produce exudates that supply carbon to the rhizosphere organisms and soil fauna. Also, since roots uptake water, they can have a drying effect on the soil in their vicinity. Fungal hyphae can serve as binding agent that stabilizes macroaggregates and they also secrete polysaccharides that contribute to microaggregation. = Other Factors Affecting Aggregate Stability = Agricultural Management  How farmers manage their land can have profound changes in aggregate stability, which can either increase or decrease aggregate stability. The main disruptors of aggregate stability are: tillage, traffic from equipment, and traffic from livestock (Oades, 1993). Tillage can disrupt soil aggregation in several ways: (i) it brings subsoil to the surface, thereby exposing it to precipitation and freeze-thaw cycles, and (ii) it changes soil moisture, temperature, and oxygen level, thereby increasing decomposition and carbon loss (Six et al., 2000a). Using reduced tillage or zero tillage practices have been shown to improve soil aggregation compared to conventional tillage methods (Six et al., 2000b). The use of cover crops has been shown to increase soil aggregation (Liu et al., 2005), due to the increase of soil organic matter and soil cover that they provide. Perennial crops typically require a halt in tillage, which prevents aggregate disruption, and allows plant to develop an extensive root system which can promote aggregate stability. Additionally, inputs of organic matter in the form of mulch or manure application can increase aggregation by adding carbon to the soil matrix and increasing rates of biological activity in the soil (Am√©zketa, 1999). Higher stocking rate of livestock such as cattle can decrease the aggregate stability of soil due to compaction of soil and loss of vegetation.  Soil Conditioners  Soil conditioners are amendments that can be applied to the soil to improve properties such as structure and water retention to improve soils for their intended use, but not specifically for soil fertility, although many soil amendments can alter the soil fertility. Some typical amendments include: lime, gypsum, sulfur, compost, wood wastes, peat, manure, biosolids, and biological amendments. In order to be effective, soil conditioners must be spread evenly across the field, be applied at the correct time to prevent nutrient loss, and have the correct nutrient content. Additionally, application of soil conditioners is site specific, and should be approached on a case by case basis, as a soil conditioner may not work on all soils equally (Hickman & Whitney, 1988Hickman, J. S. and D. A. Whitney. 1988. Soil conditioners. North Central Regional Extension Publication 295. 4 pp.).  Climate  Variations in climate and seasons can have an effect on aggregate stability of the soil. According to Dimuyiannis (2008), in a Mediterranean climate, it was found that aggregate stability varied on a nearly cyclical pattern, with lower aggregate stability in the winter and early spring compared to higher aggregate stability in the summer months. This variation in aggregate stability was found to be highly correlated with total monthly rainfall and average monthly rainfall. Aggregate stability can be impacted by the amount and intensity of precipitation. Higher amounts of precipitation and irregular rainfall events can decrease aggregate stability and increase erosion. Also, higher temperatures can increase the rates of decomposition in soil, which reduces the amount of carbon on the site, which can reduce aggregate stability. Many of the influences that climate has on soil aggregate stability are due to interactions of soil type with wetting/drying, shrinking/swelling, and freezing/thawing (Am√©zketa, 1999).  How is aggregate stability measured?  Soil aggregate stability can be measured in several ways, since: 1\\\\. Soils aggregates can be destabilized by various external pressures brought about by wind, water, or machinery. 2\\\\. Soil aggregate stability can be determined at different size scales. In most cases, the wet aggregate stability method is more relevant, because this method mimics the effects of water erosion, which is the driving force of erosion in most environments. However, in an arid environment, dry aggregate stability may be the more applicable method because it mimics wind erosion which is the driving force of erosion in these environments. Gilmour et al. (1948) describes a method where aggregates are submersed in water, and the soil that is slaked off the aggregate is measured. Emerson (1964) used a method whereby aggregates were subjected to different internal swelling pressures from different concentrations of sodium chloride (NaCl). Some common methodologies are described below.Soil sieve nests = Wet Aggregate Stability Method = A wet sieving apparatus described by Yoder (1936) can be used to determine wet aggregate stability in the following procedure by Kember and Chepil (1965), which was adapted by Nimmo and Perkins (2002). 1\\\\. Sieve soil to obtain soil samples with aggregates between 2‚Äì4 mm size aggregates. 2\\\\. Weigh out 15 g of these 2‚Äì4 mm sized aggregates. 3\\\\. Place onto top of sieve nests with sieve size openings of 4.76 mm, 2.00 mm, 1.00 mm, and 0.21 mm. 4\\\\. Slowly wet the soils using a spray bottle and humidifier until aggregates become saturated and are glistening. 5\\\\. Place sieve nests into the wet sieving apparatus with 30 rotations/minute for approximately 10 minutes. 6\\\\. Remove the sieve nests and place in the oven at 105 ¬∞C for 24 hours. 7\\\\. Place approximately 7 g of wet soil into a weighed tin, then place in the oven at 105 ¬∞C for 24. 8\\\\. Weigh the dried soil each of the sieve nestsSoil sieve nest holder Wet sieving apparatus with soil sieve nest holder and nests in place Soil sieve nests placed in the oven9. Samples can then be placed in a hexametaphosphate solution, to disperse the particles, then washed through the sieve again to remove sand particles. These sand particles can then be oven dried at 105 ¬∞C for 24 hours, weighted, and accounted for in the calculation for aggregate stability. To calculate the mean weight, the following formulae can be used: > S4= Ws4.76/ (Ws/1+√∏) > S2= Ws2/(Ws/1+√∏) > S1= Ws1/(Ws/1+√∏) > S0.21= Ws0.21/(Ws/1+√∏) > S<0.21= 1- (S4.76\\\\+ S2\\\\+ S1\\\\+ S0.21) √ò = (Wswet‚Äì Wsdry) / Wsdry > MWD (mm) = (S4.76*4.76)+(S2*2)+(S1*1)+(S0.21*0.21)+(S<0.21*0.105) For formulas: Ws4.76 = 4.76 mm sieve Ws2 = 2 mm sieve Ws1 = 1 mm sieve Ws0.21 = 0.21 mm sieve Wswet = weight of soil wet Wsdry = weight of soil dry √ò = water content MWD (mm) = mean weight diameter = Dry Aggregate Stability Method = A dry sieving rotary cylinder described by Chepil (1962) can be used in combination with a nested sieve design, as described by the following procedure by Metting and Rayburn (1983): 1\\\\. Sieve soil samples to obtain aggregates from 0.92-1.68 mm in diameter. 2\\\\. Weigh out 2 kg of soil sample aggregates. 3\\\\. Arrange soil sieve nests with openings of >0.84, 0.84-0.42, and <0.42 mm. 4\\\\. Aggregates were then fed onto the sieve nests using a conveyor belt at a speed of 10 mm/s. 5\\\\. The rotary cylinder is then operated at 10 rotations per minute until the complete sample has been separated into aggregate fractions >0.84, 0.84-0.42, and <0.42 mm.Soil sieve nests after removal from the oven with dry soil aggregates6. Dry stability is then measured as a percentage of aggregates that are >0.42 mm following rotary cylinder method. =Slaking Method= The slaking method used to measure soil aggregate stability is a measure of how well a soil aggregate sticks together when submersed in water. Several methods exist utilizing this method, one of which is the \\"Slakes: Soil Aggregate Stability\\" application developed by Fajardo and Britney (2019)Fajardo, M. McBratney, A. (2019).

The University of Sydney, Australia.. This method utilizes a smartphone and outlines how farmers and scientists are able to measure aggregate stability using samples from their field using the following method: # Take a sample of soil from the field (at 0-7.5 cm) using a spade. # Store the sample in the fridge until ready to analyze. # Select samples using a ruler to obtain aggregates from 1-2 cm in diameter and place on a shallow dish with a plain white background that you can add water to. # Set up your phone with a camera on the back so that it has a clear view of the soil aggregates. # Add water to the dish to cover the aggregates and start the app. #After several minutes, the aggregate will disperse to a varying degree. # The app will then give you a score which can be used to determine how stable your aggregate and therefore soil is.

She served from her launching in 1906 to her scrapping in 1974, in Germany. History The Sherwin was launched on March 10, 1906 as hull number #617. She had a length of 534-feet, a beam of 54-feet and a depth of 31-feet. She was powered by a 1,500 horsepower triple expansion steam engine and fueled by two coal-fired Scotch marine boilers. Her official number was U.S. #202910. The Sherwin was commissioned by the Gilchrist Transportation Company of Cleveland, Ohio. She entered service on April 13, 1906. Her homeport was Fairport, Ohio. In 1910 Gilchrist Transportation Company's fleet went into receivership . For three years the Sherwin was inactive, but in 1913 she was sold at an auction to the Lackawanna Steamship Company (Pickands Mather & Co., Mgr.) of Cleveland, Ohio. Later in 1913 the fleet was renamed Interlake Steamship Company. In 1938 the Sherwin was lengthened to 540-feet in length. In 1958 she was renamed Saturn to free up the name John Sherwin for another vessel built for the Interlake fleet. In 1959 the Saturn was sold to the Kinsman Transit Company of Cleveland, Ohio and renamed George M. Steinbrenner. In 1964 the fleet was renamed Kinsman Marine Transit Company. In 1969 the Steinbrenner was renamed Kinsman Venture. Breakwater for Ontario Hydro In 1970 the Venture was sold to the Canadian Dredge & Dock Ltd. along with the Ridgetown and the Lackawanna for use as a temporary breakwater Nanticoke, Ontario construction of a power plant for Ontario Hydro. In August 1973 she was raised and towed to Toronto, Ontario and went into layup for the winter. She was eventually sold to a German scrapyard. On August 3, 1974 she cleared Quebec with the steamer Lackawanna in tow of the Polish tug Jantar.

It is the rubidium salt of the azide ion (). Like most azides, it is explosive.  Preparation  Rubidium azide can be created by the reaction between rubidium sulfate and barium azide which results in formation of easily separated insoluble barium sulfate: :Rb2SO4 + Ba(N3)2 -> 2RbN3 + BaSO4 In at least one study, rubidium azide was produced by the reaction between butyl nitrite, hydrazine monohydrate, and rubidium hydroxide: :C4H9ONO + N2H4*H2O + RbOH ->[\\\\ce{C_2H_5OH}] RbN3 + C4H9OH + 3H2O This formula is typically used to synthesize potassium azide from caustic potash.  Uses  Rubidium azide has been investigated for possible use in alkali vapor cells, which are components of atomic clocks, atomic magnetometers and atomic gyroscopes. Azides are desirable starting materials because they decompose into rubidium metal and nitrogen gas when exposed to UV light. According to one publication: > Among the different techniques used to fill microfabricated alkali vapor > cell , UV decomposition of rubidium azide (RbN3) into metallic Rb and > nitrogen in Al2O3 coated cells is a very promising approach for low-cost > wafer-level fabrication.  Structure  At room temperature, rubidium azide has the same structure as potassium hydrogen fluoride; a distorted cesium chloride structure. At 315 ¬∞C and 1 atm, rubidium azide will transition to the normal cesium chloride structure. The II/I transition temperature of rubidium azide is within 2 ¬∞C of its melting point. Rubidium azide has a high pressure structure transition, which occurs at about 4.8 kilobars of pressure at 0 ¬∞C. The transition boundary of the II/III transition can be defined by the relationship P=4.82+0.0240t, where P is the pressure in kilobars and t is the temperature in degrees Celsius.  Reactions  As with all azides, it will decompose and release nitrogen gas when heated or severely shocked: :2RbN3 ->[\\\\Delta]2Rb + 3N2  Hazards  At 4.1 kilobars of pressure and about 460 ¬∞C, rubidium azide will explosively decompose. Under normal circumstances, it explodes at 395 ¬∞C. It also decomposes upon exposure to ultraviolet light. Rubidium azide is very sensitive to mechanical shock, with an impact sensitivity comparable to that of TNT. Like all azides, rubidium azide is toxic.

The publication's journalists have won three Ramnath Goenka Excellence in Journalism Awards and two Red Ink Awards. The Quint also operates WebQoof, a fact-checking initiative certified by the International Fact-Checking Network.  History  In May 2014, Raghav Bahl and Ritu Kapur, the promoters of Network18 ended their shareholding of the media conglomerate with the takeover by Reliance Industries. Following the controversial exit, they founded the digital media company, Quintillion Media. The company was the first major investor in the tech startup Quintype founded by Amit Rathore. Quintillion Media launched The Quint publication in January 2015 on Facebook and as a website by March 2015. Quintype took over the digital technology operations of the publication. By December 2016, The Quint website had crossed the mark of 10 million unique visitors. In February 2017, The Quint launched two online content verticals Quint Neon, a lifestyle news section and QuintLabs, a multimedia exposition platform. In the same year, it also launched the fact checking initiative WebQoof and partnered with BBC News for the production of a video series to combat disinformation. In September 2018, Google India entered into a partnership with The Quint, to host the \\"Bol: Love Your Bhasha\\" event featuring panel discussions on media readership and business strategy with the objective of laying emphasis on the potential of Indian languages. The event was attended by Anant Goenka, the executive director of the Indian Express Group, Arvind Pani, the co-founder and CEO of Reverie Language Technologies and the Minister of Road Transport and Highways, Nitin Gadkari, among others. The offices of The Quint and Raghav Bahl's residence were raided by the Income Tax Department of India in October 2018 in connection to an alleged case of tax evasion, the raid was termed as a survey by the Income Tax officers. Raghav Bahl released a statement which termed the raid as an attack on journalistic freedom while appealing to the autonomous Enforcement Directorate to back The Quint such that a precedent is set against repetition of a similar exercise on any journalistic entente. The Editors Guild of India raised concerns that while the department was within its rights to carry out inquiries, the conduct of such exercises shouldn't be akin to intimidation tactics. In January 2019, The Quint introduced subscriptions for advertisement free delivery of its content and in July, it also introduced a premium membership initiative for access to webinars for members. Raghav Bahl also completed his investment into the news publisher over the course of the years, amounting to $21.5 million from the capital gained following the sale of Network18. In May 2020, The Quint was acquired by Gaurav Mercantiles through which it was listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange. The acquisition involved all assets of Quintillion Media excluding BloombergQuint. The transaction of Quintillion Media's assets to Gaurav Mercantiles was made on a related party basis due to the Bahl and Kapur's stake in both the companies and increased the borrowing base of Gaurav Mercantiles in accordance with the Companies Act 2013. It was further reported that Gaurav Mercantiles would be renamed to Quint Digital Media. Gaurav Mercantiles was earlier a ship breaking and trading firm which had not made any revenue since March 2018; ergo it entered into a debt-for-equity swap agreement in which Bahl and Kapur collectively acquired 66.42% of the company's stakes while Haldiram Snacks Pvt Ltd and the investment bank Elara Capital acquired 17-18% and 10% stake respectively. Mohan Lal Jain, the former chairman of Gaurav Mecantiles retained 4.99% stake in the company. In September 2020, Gaurav Mecantiles was renamed to Quint Digital Media Limited.  Content  In terms of editorial content, The Quint is focused on educational and explanatory journalism. The primary mode of presentation is through newsletters, multimedia, documentary series, live video broadcasts, graphic journalism and podcasts. The site has published a range of influential stories on topics concerning sexual harassment, freedom of speech and Hindu nationalism. According to Reporters Without Borders, the site differs from other traditional news outlets in its interpretations of news with dedicated sections such as Documentaries and Explainers. The portal operates QuintLab which is described as an \\"innovation wing\\" of the publication and features an interface of various multimedia storytelling formats. The co-founder and CEO of The Quint, Ritu Kapur states that the publication's experimentation is concerted more towards the form and style of presentation that can be developed in a digital environment rather than the professional craft of journalism itself. In order to combat disinformation, the publication also operates WebQoof, a fact-checking initiative certified by the International Fact-Checking Network. The fact-checking unit runs as a public service and encourages user submissions of claims for verification. Through audience participation, it gains access to hundreds of unverified claims and uses resource intensive techniques of employing journalists to fact-check claims and debunk hoaxes. The Quint is in particular involved in combating disinformation on the messenger app WhatsApp which has been noted to have become a difficult-to-penetrate viral distribution network afflicted by disinformation in India. According to Ritu Kapur, the co-founder of the publication, the WebQoof initiative has a reassuringly high consumption which goes against the presumptions of a post-truth world. The publication had also entered into a partnership with BBC News for the co-production of an educational video series \\"Swacch Digital India\\" to highlight the importance of fact-checking to its viewers. The portal has also been noted for its advocacy journalism on gender related issues. In 2018, the \\"Talking Stalking\\" project on QuintLab was awarded gold in the \\"Best Innovation to Engage Youth Audiences\\" category by the World Association of Newspapers and News Publishers. The project was the first gender themed editorial initiative launched by the publication. Later, with funding from Facebook Inc, it launched \\"Me, The Change\\" editorial campaign focusing on stories of notable women alongside live events to encourage young women to become first time voters and elicit changes in legislation. As a result of the campaign, the Delhi Legislative Assembly passed a resolution in support of drafting a bill for making stalking, a non-bailable offence; the publication had previously held a feature event at Oxford Bookstore, New Delhi to raise support for the Stalking Bill. In 2019, the \\"Me, The Change\\" campaign received the Digipub World Award for \\"Best Brand Partnership\\". The news publication operates through three digital platforms; the English language edition The Quint, the Hindi language edition The Quint Hindi and the healthcare news microsite called FIT. According to Raghav Bahl, co-founder of The Quint, the site's distinctive feature is its broad spectrum of coverage which \\"includes policy, politics, sports, business, food, entertainment and everything else\\" extending beyond the \\"narrow focus\\" of other news outlets. It has also been described by Reporters Without Borders as the first mobile based news service; the content of The Quint is primarily emphasized towards distribution through social media and mobile devices. Since December 2015, the publication has also been in a collaboration with Facebook Inc. on its Instant Articles project and has presence on the social media platforms of Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube.  Reception  A story published in the Columbia Journalism Review in late 2016 identified The Quint as one of several independent and recently founded internet-based media platforms ‚Äì a group that also included Newslaundry, Scroll.in, The News Minute, The Wire and ScoopWhoop ‚Äì that were attempting to challenge the dominance of India's traditional print and television news companies and their online offshoots. The Quint has also been certified by the Poynter Institute's International Fact-Checking Network for its reporting in WebQoof, its in-house fact-checking division. The publication has received recognition through a number of prestigious awards for its public interest journalism. In a report of the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism, The Quint was compared with the Filipino news publication Rappler and the South African online newspaper Daily Maverick, and described as digital-born commercial news publishers engaged in producing critical independent journalism in destabilising democracies. According to the report, The Quint has faced extreme external pressure in the form of politically motivated attacks on media freedom, orchestrated digital disinformation campaigns and significant online harassment against its journalists; it was noted that online harassment was particularly severe against women journalists, often including threats of violence ranging from sexual assault to rape and murder. In February 2017, The Quint published a sting video focused on how the Army's jawans were being deployed as sahayaks and performed a variety of menial tasks for officers; the profiled naik committed suicide a week afterwards in fear of an impending court-martial. The Army subsequently booked the Quint reporter for abetting his suicide, and violating the Official Secrets Act of India by trespassing into a prohibited area. Media critics have since dubbed the sting-operation as \\"overzealous journalism\\" with a host of ethical issues. In 2019, Bombay High Court quashed all charges against The Quint noting the Army to be vindictive. Kulbhushan Jadhav is an Indian national who was arrested in Pakistan on charges of terrorism and spying for the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) ‚Äì India's external intelligence agency. After the arrest, on 5 January 2018, The Quint published a story by the journalist Chandan Nandy which claimed that Jadhav was being used to collect intelligence for India and that two former chiefs of the Research and Analysis Wing had allegedly stated that they were against the recruitment of Jadhav as a spy. The Hindu's Frontline magazine also published a story with a similar claim. The stories were picked up by Pakistani media agencies as apparent confirmation of Jadhav's affiliation. It drew criticism in India; the media watchdog Newslaundry raised questions on how The Quint could have been privy to such information. The publication retracted the story on 7 January stating that the factual accuracy of the article required rechecking. The story was later quoted by Pakistan in a related International Court of Justice case. On 27 March 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic in India, The Quint published an article which reported that India was in stage-3 transmission (community transmission). The government's Press Information Bureau denied the occurrence of community transmission and labeled the story as \\"misleading\\". The Times of India published a \\"fact-check\\" affirming the PIB statement and clarifying that the person being quoted did not have medical qualifications but had a PhD in Quality management. However, medical professionals also questioned the basis of the government's continued denial with some asserting that community transmission had already begun in March. The report published by The Quint had quoted Girdhar Gyani, the head of the NGO, Association of Healthcare Providers. Later the publication updated the article without any retractions to include information about Girdhar Gyani having been appointed as the convener of a Covid-19 hospital task force. As of 12 June, the Ministry of Health continued to deny any occurrence of community transfer in contradiction to opinions of independent medical experts. = Awards = * The Quint won three gold and one bronze at WAN‚ÄìIFRA South Asian Digital Media Awards 2016.

She lived most of her remarkably long life in Calcutta, and was witness to an era which spanned from the inception of British rule over Bengal in 1757 to its utter consolidation by the early 1800s.

Background and early life She was born Frances Croke, the second daughter of Edward Croke or Crook (1690 ‚Äì 12 Feb 1769), Governor of Fort St. David, 100 miles south of Madras (now Chennai). Her mother was Isabella Beizor, from a Portuguese family. Although there has been speculation that she might have had an Indian ancestor (see Anglo-Indian), there is no proof of this. Her sister Sophia married Alexander Wynch, grandfather of Florentia Sale, author of A Journal of the Disasters in Afghanistan, 1841‚Äì42. Frances spent the first few years of her life in south India (the Madras Presidency) and much of her later life in Eastern India (the Bengal Presidency). First three marriages South Hill Park Hanslope Church As a very young woman (allegedly aged thirteen, though this is contested),https://genealogy.links.org/links- cgi/readged?/home/ben/camilla-genealogy/current+c-croke93555+2-2-0-1 Frances married for the first time. Her husband was Parry Purpler Templer, nephew of the then Governor of Calcutta, Thomas Broddyll (also spelled Bradyll). She bore two children in quick succession, but her husband and both of their children died within a couple of years of the wedding. Frances married secondly James Altham, but he died less than a fortnight after the wedding. Two years after the death of her second husband, Frances married again, and she was no more than 24 years old. On 24 March 1749, in Calcutta, she married thirdly William Watts (c. 1722 ‚Äì 4 August 1764), who was by this point a senior member of the council in Bengal and a senior official in the British East India Company. The first two or three years of their marriage were peaceful, but the early 1750s was a period of political strife in Bengal, and the couple were caught up in the turmoil surrounding the succession of Siraj ud-Daulah on the death of his grandfather Alivardi Khan. Frances was separated from her husband, and held in captivity along with her children. The widow of Alivardi Khan treated them well, and took them to protection in the French town of Chandannagar. The turmoil ended with the Battle of Plassey in 1757. In 1758, Frances's husband was given a fortune in recognition of his services, and was briefly appointed governor of Fort William, but he chose to retire \\"home\\", as the phrase was. The family moved to England, the first time that Frances had ever set foot in that country. They bought a country estate near Bracknell, Berkshire and built a typical English country house; South Hill Park is now an arts centre. They were in the process of buying Hanslope Park, Hanslope, Buckinghamshire, when her husband died in August 1764. The sale was completed for their son Edward, who became Lord of the Manor. Return to India and fourth marriage St. John's Church, Kolkata After Watts died in 1764, Frances spent the next five years as a widow in England. Once her children were grown up and settled there, she returned to India around 1769, some ten years after having left. This decision was a truly extraordinary one. The voyage to India, via the Cape of Good Hope, took several months, and there was little prospect that she would ever see any of her children again. Moreover, she was a widow in her mid-40s, and she had essentially nothing to do in India; no family to care for and certainly no job or office to hold. During those years, it was normal for British men to go to India while they were still teenagers, to make a fortune there, take Indian wives and adopt the Indian way of life, but it was highly unusual for Englishwomen of any age to be in India at all. The \\"Memsahib\\" came in force to India only after the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869. It is unclear why Frances separated herself from her children and returned to India, unless she had found herself a misfit in British society and had been unable to adjust to a new environment during the ten years she spent there. Perhaps she yearned for the familiar places, scenes and way of life to which she had been accustomed for the first thirty- three years of her life. Perhaps she had some relatives of Indian blood, and wanted to be with them; perhaps her relationship with her children was not entirely cordial. Whatever the reason, she set sail for India in 1769 and settled in Calcutta, the scene of the best years of her life, when her husband had held high office there and made a fortune besides. She was a wealthy woman, and her fortune had even greater purchase in India than in England, and she lived in some state, in a large mansion with many servants. In 1772, an Oxford graduate arrived in Calcutta, one Reverend William Johnson, who was officially an assistant chaplain to the military forces of Fort William, but in practice supported the whole British population of Calcutta. The wealthy widow and the forceful clergyman married in 1774; this final marriage gave her the name by which she was best known, Begum Johnson. Begum is an honorific for married women in India, used by Muslim ladies and applied, in those early days, to other non-Hindu women, designating them as respectable matrons. Johnson \\"was a man of immense energy, great assurance, and not easily discouraged by opposition.\\" Upon landing in India, he quickly mounted a campaign to build the city's first Anglican cathedral, now St. Johns Church. It took the chaplain many years to raise the necessary money, but the foundation stone was finally laid in 1784, and the church was consecrated in 1787. Separation and later life It may have been expected that, having persevered with his noble project for so many years, and having brought it to fruition, the reverend would now spend his remaining years in the near vicinity of the edifice, rejoicing in his work and lavishing attention on its further embellishment. That was not the case. His project completed, the reverend, who had been in India for sixteen years already, wanted to at least make a long visit to England, receive the honours, encomiums and ecclesiastical preferments attendant upon the completion of his noble work, perhaps spend his remaining years in his native land. However, his wife was not inclined to leave her native land, and not averse to the idea of living apart from her husband. The marriage had apparently been less than idyllic, for cultural reasons: Johnson had found his wife a little too well-adjusted into Indian ways, and she likewise had found his evangelical bent and supercilious attitude towards India irksome. Frances lacked her husband's enthusiasm for evangelism, and had not exactly emptied her coffers to fulfil his dream; she now chose to spent her money in quite another way. She offered William Johnson a settlement and an annuity if he would go away to England without her, and avoid coming back. They agreed that they would be better off without each other, and simply parted ways, divorce (especially for a clergyman) being quite impossible in those days. Eyre Chatterton, the inaugural Bishop of Nagpur, wrote of the Johnsons in his 1924 A History of the Church of England in India: Begum Johnson was 59 years old and never married again. Kathleen Blechynden wrote in Calcutta: Past and Present(1905): She died in Calcutta on 3 February 1812. Her memorial in St. John's Church (no longer the cathedral) states 'The oldest British resident in Bengal, universally beloved, respected and revered'. In 1990 the British Association for Cemeteries in South Asia published a book entitled The Calcutta of Begum Johnson, taking her name to sum up an age. Descendants Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool, her grandson Frances married four times, and had children by at least two of those marriages, but only three of her children, all borne to William Watts, survived to adulthood. All three of them left descendants notable in politics and empire-building: *The couple's daughter Amelia married George III's close adviser Charles Jenkinson, later the first Earl of Liverpool. An early portrait by Joshua Reynolds is thought to have been of her. She died aged 19, shortly after giving birth to Robert, who grew up to be Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.D. Leonard 2008 Nineteenth- Century British Premiers: Pitt to Rosebery. Palgrave Macmillan: p. 82. *The couple's daughter Sophia married George Poyntz Ricketts of Midgham, Jamaica (named after Midgham, Berkshire, the family seat of the Poyntz) and Grove Place in Nursling, Hampshire. He became governor of Tobago in 1793 and of Barbados the following year, a post he held till his death in 1800. Their son Charles Milner Ricketts (1776-1867) (presumed to be named after Sir William Milner, 2nd Baronet) spent most of his working life in India as a respected administrator, married a sister of Michael Prendergast (MP), and on his retirement became an MP himself. *The couple's only son, Edward Watts, lived in Hanslope Park, purchased by the family in 1764, just around the time that William Watts died.

Patton Dr. Gary Patton is an American technologist and business executive. He is currently the Corporate Vice President and General Manager of Design Enablement in the Technology Development Group at Intel. He has spent most of his career in IBM, starting in IBM's Research Division and holding management and executive positions in IBM's Microelectronics Division in Technology Development, Design Enablement, Manufacturing, and Business Line Management.  Early life and education  Dr. Patton was born and raised in Glendale, CA. He received his B.S. degree in electrical engineering from UCLA, where he graduated summa cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa, and his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Stanford University. His Ph.D. work was on the physics of polycrystalline silicon emitters for bipolar transistors. Dr. Patton was the first in his family to attend college.  Career = 1986‚Äì2015: IBM = Dr. Patton was with IBM for almost 30 years, starting in 1986 at IBM's T.J. Watson Research Center. He held management and executive positions in research, technology and product development, manufacturing, and business unit management in IBM's Research, Microelectronics, and Storage Technology Divisions. He was selected to be a member of IBM Corporate's Growth & Transformation Team (G&TT;), a group consisting of approximately 300 of the top IBM executives chartered with driving growth and transformation initiatives across the company. During the last eight years of his career at IBM, Patton was Vice President of IBM's Semiconductor Research and Development Center (SRDC), where he was responsible for IBM's semiconductor R&D; roadmap, operations, execution, and technology development alliances. As the head of IBM's SRDC, he led the teams responsible for the development of multiple generations of leading-edge process technologies (45 nm through 7 nm technologies). These technologies powered next-generation IBM servers and a wide range of consumer products, and incorporated major technology innovations such as Silicon-On-Insulator, advanced strain engineering, embedded DRAM memory solutions, high-k/metal gate and FinFET technologies. Dr. Patton drove the introduction of high performance embedded DRAM memory into IBM microprocessors at 45 nm. By addressing microprocessor memory bandwidth issues, this new technology improved microprocessor performance in multi-core designs, and accelerated the movement of graphics in gaming, networking, and other image intensive, multi-media applications. He also led the development of the IBM Alliance's 32/28 nm high-k.metal gate technologies currently used today in a wide range of consumer and industrial applications. This innovation reduced transistor power requirements while simultaneously delivering improved circuit speed. During this time, Dr. Patton also led IBM's advanced technology R&D; efforts at the State University of New York (SUNY) Polytechnic Institute, pioneering many innovations in collaboration with IBM's research partners. These innovations included the development of 14 nm FinFET technology, which has since been commercialized, and the semiconductor industry's first 7 nm test chips with functioning transistors. Among the novel processes and techniques pioneered at 7 nm were a number of industry-first innovations, most notably Silicon Germanium (SiGe) channel FinFET transistors and the use of Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography. Dr. Patton was involved with IBM's technology development alliances from its very beginning in the early 1990s. In 1992, he led the IBM-Siemens-Toshiba 64Mb DRAM technology development team and delivered this technology into manufacturing. He assumed senior management positions in manufacturing engineering and production operations in IBM's Advanced Semiconductor Technology Center, the facility where IBM's technology development alliance work took place. He then served as the Executive Assistant to the Senior Vice President of IBM's Technology Group. This led to Dr. Patton's executive appointment in 1999 as the Director of IBM Microelectronics' Wireless Business Unit. In 2002, he moved to IBM's Storage Technology Division, where he was the Vice President of research and development of magnetic heads and media for IBM's Hard Disk Drive products. IBM sold this business to Hitachi in 2003 and it was merged with Hitachi's Hard Disk Drive business to become Hitachi Global Storage Technology (HGST). He was Vice President & General Manager for HGST's Head & Media Business Unit, as well as the General Manager for HGST's San Jose, CA site. He returned to IBM in 2005 as Vice President of Technology Development in IBM Microelectronics Divisions' SRDC. He was asked to lead the SRDC in 2007. He held this position for eight years, until GlobalFoundries' acquisition of IBM's Microelectronics Division. During his career at IBM, Patton's pioneering work on SiGe Heterojunction Bipolar Transistors (HBT) created the foundation for today's SiGe HBT BiCMOS technologies which are used in a wide range of wireless communication devices (e.g., cell phones, PDAs, wireless LANs, GPS devices). In the late 1980s, he and a small team of researchers at IBM's T.J. Watson Research Center demonstrated the first working SiGe heterojunction transistor and established a world record for silicon transistor performance, tripling the previous record. They also developed the first manufacturable approach for making a high volume SiGe BiCMOS technology. Later, as the head of IBM Microelectronics' wireless business unit, which was effectively a start-up business at that time, Patton drove industry adoption of IBM's SiGe BiCMOS technology and other radio frequency (RF), analog, and mixed signal technology offerings. Today, most mobile devices contain several chips manufactured using these technologies. = 2015‚Äì2019: GlobalFoundries = Dr. Gary Patton speaking at GlobalFoundries' Technology Conference in 2017 Patton served as GlobalFoundries‚Äô Chief Technology Office and Senior Vice President of Worldwide R&D; and Design Enablement, responsible for the company's semiconductor technology research and development roadmap, operations, and execution.

Their operating system was DOS-like. By the late-1990s, non-Intel processors and other operating systems were used for some devices, using Microsoft's Windows CE operating system, even as the term Handheld was growing. The term PC was helpful, since many Palmtop PCs and Handheld PCs came with some personal-computer, PDA and office applications pre-installed in ROM, and most of them could also run generic, off-the-shelf PC software with minimal if any modifications. Some could also run other operating systems such as GEOS, MINIX 2.0, Windows 1.0-3.0 (in Real mode only), or Linuxthe latter when equipped with additional RAM/beyond-8088 hardware. Most palmtop PCs were based on a static hardware design for low power consumption and instant-on/off without a need to reboot. Depending on the model, the battery could power the device from several hours up to several days while running, or between a week and a year in standby mode. Combined with the instant-on/off feature, a battery would typically last from a week up to several months in practical use as PDA. Handheld computer, Palm PC, Palmtop and Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) were used concurrently and almost interchangeably. to describe these pocket-sized computing devices. The acronym PIM referred to Personal Information Manager, a similar type of device that often came with a stylus interface instead of a keyboard. None of these, at the time, were intended to replace the PC. =Non-Wintel (Palm-top/Palm-size/Pocket computer)= Not all of the pocket-sized hardware was/is used for Windows/Intel systems.

Clarifai is headquartered in New York City with two satellite offices in San Francisco and Washington D.C.  History  Clarifai was founded in 2013 by Matthew Zeiler, a Ph.D. student who recently placed in the top 5 spots of the 2013 ImageNet Challenge. Initially, the company offered free and paid versions of image and video recognition via their API and a consumer-facing iPhone app called Forevery. In 2014 Style Me Pretty, a wedding lifestyle website which used the technology to provide images that are personally adapted to the user, became Clarifai's first customer. In 2016, Clarifai released version 2 of their API, adding custom training and visual search to its platform. In 2017 the company moved all research work to a San Francisco office and all government-related endeavors to an office in Washington D.C. Later that year, the company announced a mobile SDK, which allowed users to run their platform without an internet connection. In 2019, Clarifai opened a new office in Estonia's capital city Tallinn.  Funding  In 2015, Clarifai raised $10 million in its Series A funding round, led by Union Square Ventures (USV). After the 2016 launch of their v2 API, Menlo Ventures led their $30 million Series B round, with participation from USV, Lux Capital, and Osage University Partners.  Technology  The core of Clarifai's technology is based on convolutional neural networks, which Zeiler focused on for his PhD work. It is a process which enables a computer to learn from data examples and draw its own conclusions, giving applications the ability to predict correct tags for images or videos. The platform includes the ability to moderate content, perform visual search, visual similarity, and organize media collections. It has pre-built recognition models that can identify a specific set of concepts like food or travel, NSFW, and its general model which can identify a range of concepts including objects, ideas, and emotion. It also has the ability to create custom models which can identify other arbitrary objects such as cars or breeds of dogs. The 2018 Model 1.5 with machine-labeled datasets claims to recognize up to 11,000 concepts from object detection, as well as things like mood or theme.  Clients  In 2017 Clarifai had about 100 customers and its technology was used by Unilever, Ubisoft, BuzzFeed, and also by companies producing medical devices and drones.  Military work  In 2018 Zeiler disclosed that the company was a participant in Project Maven, a US Department of Defense AI program. The disclosure, in a blog post on the company website, came after a Wired story reported that a former employee had filed a wrongful termination suit. The suit alleged that she was dismissed for requesting that Clarifai disclose a 2017 server compromise to the Pentagon and other customers. Zeiler asserted (in a company blog, posted on June 13, 2018, in response to the server-breach controversy) that the breach involved only \\"an isolated research server\\", and that customers were notified following an external security audit. In late January, 2019, several Clarifai employees posted an open letter on a company message board expressing concerns that the June 13 blog-post of Zeiler‚Äôs contained implications of Clarifai‚Äôs complicit involvement with potentially unethical uses of AI technology, e.g. automated warfare. These allegations are part of the societal concern over the ethical development and use of AI, which has been growing alongside the pace of AI‚Äôs advancement. Is Ethical A.I. Even Possible?

It has a single thin leaf fused to the flowering stem and up to twenty five small, greenish and reddish flowers. It grows in forest and woodland in Victoria, the Australian Capital Territory and New South Wales. Description Genoplesium clivicola is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single thin leaf fused to the flowering stem. Up to twenty five greenish flowers with reddish or purplish markings are arranged along a flowering stem long and reaching to a height of . The flowers are wide and are inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The dorsal sepal is egg-shaped with the narrower end towards the base, long and about wide. The lateral sepals are linear to lance-shaped, about long, wide, with a pouched base and spread apart from each other. The petals are egg- shaped, long and about wide with a pointed tip. The labellum is egg-shaped with the narrower end towards the base, long, about wide and there is an narrow egg-shaped callus in the centre of the labellum and extending nearly to its tip. Flowering occurs from January to May. Taxonomy and naming Corunastylis clivicola was first formally described in 2007 by David Jones from a specimen collected in the Black Mountain Reserve and the description was published in The Orchadian. In 2014 Julian Shaw changed the name to Genoplesium clivicola. The specific epithet (clivicola) is derived from the Latin word clivus meaning \\"ascent\\", \\"elevation\\", \\"hill\\" or \\"sloping hillside\\" with the suffix -cola meaning \\"dweller\\". Distribution and habitat Genoplesium clivicola grows in Victoria north of the Great Dividing Range, except for a disjunct population in the Brisbane Ranges National Park. In New South Wales it is found on the Central and Southern Tablelands, including the Australian Capital Territory.

Noble is a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles in the Department of Information Studies. She is a Co- Director of the Critical Internet Inquiry Center and also works with African American Studies and Gender Studies. Her best-selling book, Algorithms Of Oppression, has been featured in the Los Angeles Review of Books, New York Public Library 2018 Best Books for Adults, and Bustle‚Äôs magazine 10 Books about Race to Read Instead of Asking a Person of Color to Explain Things to You. Her work markets the ways that digital media impacts issues of race, gender, culture, and technology. Overview Algorithms of Oppression is a text based on over six years of academic research on Google search algorithms. Noble argues that search algorithms become racist because they reflect the biases and values of the people who create them.Noble's main focus is on Google‚Äôs algorithms, although she also discusses Amazon, Facebook, Twitter, and WordPress. She invests in the control over what users see and don't see. \\"Search results reflects the values and norms of the search companies commercial partners and advertisers and often reflect our lowest and most demeaning beliefs, because these ideas circulate so freely and so often that they are normalized and extremely profitable.\\" (Nobel, 36) These algorithms can then have negative biases against women of color and other marginalized populations, while also affecting Internet users in general by leading to \\"racial and gender profiling, misrepresentation, and even economic redlining.\\" She mentions the issue of technological redlining, that profiles users. Chapter Summaries=Chapter 1= In Chapter 1 of Algorithms of Oppression, Safiya Noble explores how Google search‚Äôs auto suggestion feature is demoralizing. On September 18, 2011 a mother googled ‚Äúblack girls‚Äù attempting to find fun activities to show her stepdaughter and nieces. To her surprise, the results encompassed websites and images of porn. This result encloses the data failures specific to people of color and women which Noble coins algorithmic oppression. Noble also adds that as a society we must have a feminist lens, with racial awareness to understand the ‚Äúproblematic positions about the benign instrumentality of technologies.‚Äù Noble also discusses how Google can remove the human curation from the first page of results to eliminate any potential racial slurs or inappropriate imaging. Another example discussed in this text is a public dispute of the results that were returned when ‚Äújew‚Äù was searched on Google. The results included a number of anti- Semitic pages and Google claimed little ownership for the way it provided these identities. Google instead encouraged people to use ‚Äújews‚Äù or ‚ÄúJewish people‚Äù and claimed the actions of White supremacist groups are out of Google‚Äôs control. Unless pages are unlawful, Google will allow its algorithm to continue to act without removing pages. Noble reflects on AdWords which is Google's advertising tool and how this tool can add to the biases on Google. Adwords allows anyone to advertise on Google‚Äôs search pages and is highly customizable. First, Google ranks ads on relevance and then displays the ads on pages which is believes are relevant to the search query taking place. An advertiser can also set a maximum amount of money per day to spend on advertising. The more you spend on ads, the higher probability your ad will be closer to the top. Therefore, if an advertiser is passionate about his/her topic but is controversial it may be the first to appear on a Google search. Critical reception Critical reception for Algorithms of Oppression has been largely positive. In the Los Angeles Review of Books, Emily Drabinski writes, \\"What emerges from these pages is the sense that Google‚Äôs algorithms of oppression comprise just one of the hidden infrastructures that govern our daily lives, and that the others are likely just as hard-coded with white supremacy and misogyny as the one that Noble explores.\\" In PopMatters, Hans Rollman describes writes that Algorithms of Oppression \\"demonstrate[s] that search engines, and in particular Google, are not simply imperfect machines, but systems designed by humans in ways that replicate the power structures of the western countries where they are built, complete with all the sexism and racism that are built into those structures.\\" In Booklist, reviewer Lesley Williams states, \\"Noble‚Äôs study should prompt some soul-searching about our reliance on commercial search engines and about digital social equity.\\" In early February 2018, Algorithms of Oppression received press attention when the official Twitter account for the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers expressed criticism of the book, citing that the thesis of the text, based on the text of the book's official blurb on commercial sites, could not be reproduced. IEEE's outreach historian, Alexander Magoun, later revealed that he had not read the book, and issued an apology.

It is defined as an extremely clear and transparent sound pattern of an instrumental piece. It stands in opposition to the music of the Classical-Romantic period which favoured the merging of the individual instrumental voices to one complex sound. Examples of applied Spaltklang can be found in New Music such as Igor Stravinsky‚Äôs Histoire du soldat. Instrumental categories are represented by the high- and low-pitched instruments; middle-toned instruments, on the other hand, are not accounted for. In the string section, for instance, only violin and double bass are represented, while viola and cello are not. This pitch gap creates a clear contrast and prevents the individual tones from merging into one sound. Moreover, the term appears in connection with multiphonics. The term Spaltklang can also be found in the field of organ building. Here, it refers to organs that have registers with very different and distinct timbres. Therefore, single registers tend to be played in isolation. This is in contrast to organs which operate on the basis of a merged sound, which is achieved by adding registers to a root note. Spaltklang seems to be particularly associated with organs from the Renaissance period. Amongst organists, Spaltklang is furthermore used to describe the omission of a register, e.g. playing the 8‚Äò and 2‚Äô registers but omitting the 4‚Äô register.

It is a common dish and street food in various areas of the world. Some restaurants and pizza stands only sell pizza by the slice, while others sell both slices and whole pizzas. The jumbo slice is a large-sized slice of New York-style pizza that is a prominent food in Washington, D.C. Pizza al taglio is a variety of pizza that originated in Rome, Italy and is typically purveyed by the slice and sold by weight. Overview Some pizzerias provide pizza by the slice and whole pizza pies, and some only provide pizza by the slice. Pizza by the slice is typically pre-cooked and pre-sliced, and is sometimes kept warm under heat lamps. Upon ordering, slices are sometimes re-heated in a pizza oven before being served. Selling pizza by the slice sometimes enables restaurants to realize increased profits, because the slice format allows for quick lunchtime service compared to customers having to order and wait for a whole pizza that is prepared from scratch. The price of pizza slices is also typically significantly less than the cost of a whole pie, which enables consumer purchases. Pizza by the slice is prevalent in the United States, and significant consumer demand exists for the product in the U.S. Many pizzerias in New York City (NYC) purvey New York-style pizza by the slice, and some also provide Sicilian pizza by the slice. There are over 1,000 pizzerias and \\"slice shops\\" in NYC, and many purvey both whole pies and slices. In NYC, New York- style pizza is most commonly ordered by consumers as pizza by the slice. Pizza is a common street food in NYC, and some pizzerias compete, vying to provide \\"best\\" slice in the city. The dish is common in some areas of the Balkans, such as Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Macedonia and Slovenia. In Bulgaria, it is a common street food that is purveyed by street vendors and street pizza booths. Pizza by the slice is also manufactured as a frozen food, and is sometimes packaged in individual serving portions.

Biography Portraits of five Cameroonian politicians who, in different historical periods, fought and died for the independence Herv√© Youmbi has a diploma from the Institut de Formation Artistique (IFA) in Mbalmayo, Cameroon. He also studied at the √âcole Sup√©rieure des Arts D√©coratifs de Strasbourg (France) from October 2000 to June 2001. He teaches art at several towns in Cameroon, at the art institutes of Nkongsamba and Foumban, and in the art academies and universities of Douala and Dschang.

Through a close study of the human body in an urban setting, he asks questions about his city, the towns where he has stayed, those he passes through and dreams about getting to know. These are his sources of inspiration and artistic expression. In 2010, he explores the impact of global capitalism on the contemporary arts in Africa with his multimedia installation Ces totems qui hantent la m√©moire des fils de Mamadou (These totems who haunt the memory of the son of Mamadou). The photography triptych Au nom du p√®re, du fils et de la sainte monarchie constitutionnelle (In the name of the father, the son and the holy constitutional monarchy) rises up in 2012 against the violence of the dictatorial regimes in Africa. His installation Visages de masques presented at Bandjoun Station (Cameroon) looks at the impact of colonization on the making of ritual masks in Africa during the era of globalization. The treatment of historical subjects has occupied an important place in his work, through works like Cameroonian heroes, presented during SUD 2007 in Douala, tribute to the first Cameroonian resistance against German colonization. Herv√© Youmbi received the Cultures France scholarship awarding an artist visa in 2009 and the Smithsonian Artist Research Fellowship 2012 from the Smithsonian in Washington DC, USA. His works are in some leading collections, such as the World Bank and the Smithsonian National Museum of African Art in Washington.

Rhoads & Sons was the longest continually operating company in the United States until it closed in 2009 after 307 years in business. Founded in 1702 in Marple, Pennsylvania, it eventually relocated to Wilmington, Delaware and, finally, to Branchburg, New Jersey. Until the 1990s it was owned by descendants of its founder, Joseph Rhoads. History J.E. Rhoads & Sons was founded by Joseph Rhoads as the Rhoads Company, a commercial tannery, in 1702 in Marple, Pennsylvania. The company came to specialize in the manufacture of leather belts for mechanical applications. Following the American Civil War, the company purchased the Downing & Price tannery in Wilmington, Delaware and moved much of its manufacturing operations there in 1868, while keeping its headquarters in Pennsylvania. In the 20th century the company transitioned most of its product lines from leather to rubber-made, relocated the company's headquarters to Wilmington, and made an initial public offering of shares. In 1977 it would, again, relocate, this time to suburban New Castle County, Delaware. In 1983 John McGough joined J.E. Rhoads & Sons as chief executive officer, becoming the first person outside the Rhoads family to head the company since its founding. Ten years later, in 1993, a majority of the company's shares were sold out of the Rhoads family to an anonymous buyer, who moved its operations to an industrial park in Branchburg, New Jersey. The company went out of business in 2009. Its name and trademarks were subsequently sold to Mid Atlantic Belting, a company founded by Richard Miller II who had been employed by J.E. Rhoads & Sons in the 1970s. =Military contracts= Since the company's founding, members of the Rhoads family were Quakers. During the War of 1812, the American Civil War, and World War I, the company suffered ‚Äì relative to its competitors ‚Äì due to its decision not to pursue lucrative military contracts, or to sell belting to arms manufacturers, owing to the owners pacifist beliefs. The increasing complexity of military industry stressed the company's ethos during World War II and management decided on applying a \\"50 percent\\" rule. In addition to an outright ban on direct military sales, salespeople were instructed not to solicit or close contracts with companies they believed sold 50 percent or more of their products to the U.S. Armed Forces. =Longevity= Prior to its closure, both The New York Times and the Library of Congress referred to J.E. Rhoads & Sons as the longest continually operating American business still in existence. Legacy The company's records from 1720 through the year 1969 are held by the Hagley Museum and Library in Wilmington, Delaware.

Among his many feats of arms was taking possession of admiral Samuel Story's squadron of the Batavian Navy after its surrender in the Vlieter IncidentEven in reputable contemporary and historical sources his name is often misspelled Winthorp, but after cross-checking with his postings there should be no doubt. Personal life Winthrop was the youngest son of John S. Winthrop of New London, Conn. and Elizabeth Sheriffe Hay. He was a lineal descendant of governors John Winthrop of Massachusetts and John Winthrop the Younger of Connecticut, Chief Justice Wait Winthrop of Massachusetts, and John Winthrop (1681‚Äì1747) FRS, his grandfather.Ward, p. 673, note 1 His family evidently had Loyalist sympathies as he was entrusted to the care of a maternal uncle, attached to the British forces in New York, after the death of his father in 1778 (he crossed the line under a flag of truce to join this relative). This relative secured a place as a midshipman in the Royal Navy, where his education was completed.Ward, p. 673 Winthrop married Sarah Farbrace on 23 December 1804 in Dover. He had two sons and four daughters with her. Ward, p. 675 Career The first recorded mention of Winthrop as a midshipman is aboard admiral Rodney's flagship during the Battle of the Saintes on 12 April 1782Ward, p. 673. He was commissioned as a lieutenant (RN) in 1790 and in 1794 during the conquest of Martinique commanded a battalion of seamen attached to Prince Edward's brigadeWard, p. 673 In the Spring of 1796 he commanded the sloop at the capture of St. Lucia. The same year he captured the French privateer Athenienne near BarbadosWard, p. 673. He then received command of HMS Undaunted, but was shipwrecked on the Morant Cays on 27 August 1796Ward, p. 674. Winthrop received a commission as a post-captain on 16 December 1796. He received command of the frigate HMS Circe in December 1797, and was stationed in the North Sea. On 14 May 1798 HMS Circe took part in the Expedition to Ostend. Winthrop superintended the landing of troops so successfully that he was rewarded with the honor of conveying Sir Home Popham's dispatch to London Ward, p. 674. In the Summer of 1799 Winthrop (still commanding HMS Circe) was put in charge of a squadron of frigates, comprising Jalouse, , Espiegle, and . On 27 June 1799 boats from these ships raided the Dutch island of Ameland, hoping to capture a number of Batavian gunboats. When this proved impossible, they cut out 12 Dutch merchantmen, lying in the roadstead, despite heavy fire from shore batteriesWard, p. 674. In August 1799 HMS Circe was part of the fleet that supported the Anglo- Russian invasion of Holland. Together with col. Maitland and lieutenant (RN) Collier, Winthrop was sent by admiral Mitchell as a parlimentaire to admiral Story commanding the Batavian squadron lying in the Texel roadstead. Due to sloppiness of the officers conducting the pilot boat in which they approached the Dutch fleet, the British parlimentaires were able to collect important information about the state of readiness and the morale of the crews. They also appear to have conspired with several Dutch officers to influence admiral Story and to foment a mutiny among the crew of the flagship Washington, which later brought about the surrender of the squadron without firing a shotColenbrander, H.T.,Gedenkstukken der algemeene geschiedenis van Nederland van 1795 tot 1840, vol. 3 (Nijhoff, 1907), pp. 393-394. After the surrender Winthrop took possession of the Batavian ships on behalf of admiral Mitchell in what has become known as the Vlieter IncidentWard, p. 674. In 1800 Winthrop received command of the frigate , which took part in the expedition against Ferrol, but was beached in Vigo Bay, after which she had to be destroyed by fireWard, p. 674. On renewal of the war after the Treaty of Amiens captain Winthrop received command of the Ship of the line (64). With this ship he drove the French corvette Bayonnaise on the beach in Finisterre Bay on 28 November 1803, after which the crew burned the shipWard, p. 674. Around 1805 Winthrop was given command of the frigate HMS Sybille with which he captured the French privateer Oiseau in the English Channel on 3 May 1807. Ward, p. 674. In the Summer of 1807 Winthrop was put in charge of the Dover district of the Sea FenciblesWard, p. 675 On 12 August 1819 he attained the rank of Rear- Admiral of the WhiteMarshall, p. 761.

Following the move to HBO, the series was expected to begin filming in March 2020, before the COVID-19 pandemic delayed production. The team is now hoping to start filming in the fall of 2020. HBO has reportedly committed to 10 episodes. Development In September 2012, The Daily Telegraph reported Julian Fellowes as saying that he was working on a spin-off prequel of Downton Abbey that revolves around Lord Grantham and Cora's romance and eventual marriage as the Earl and Countess of Grantham. Initially conceived as a book, it was then planned for pick-up by ITV. Production and writing for The Gilded Age was updated in January 2016. Asked whether he'd written the script yet, Fellowes said, 'No I haven't, no. I'm doing that this year', before adding: 'And then hopefully shooting at the end of the year.'\\" On June 4, 2016, Fellowes was asked by The Los Angeles Times, \\"Where does The Gilded Age stand?\\" Fellowes replied, \\"It stands really with me up to my neck in research, and I‚Äôm clearing the decks, so that when I start Gilded Age, I‚Äôm only doing Gilded Age. These people were extraordinary. You can see why they frightened the old guard, because they saw no boundaries. They wanted to build a palace, they built a palace. They wanted to buy a yacht, they bought a yacht. And the old guard in New York weren‚Äôt like that at all, and suddenly this whirlwind of couture descended on their heads. They redesigned being rich. They created a rich culture that we still have‚Äîpeople who are rich are rich in a way that was established in America in the 1880s, ‚Äô90s, 1900s. It was different from Europe. Something like Newport would never have happened in any other country, where you have huge palaces, and then about 20 yards away, another huge palace, and 20 yards beyond that another huge palace. In England right up to the 1930s, when people made good money, they would buy an estate of 5,000 acres and they‚Äôd have to look after Nanny. The Americans of the 1880s and ‚Äô90s didn‚Äôt want too much of that.\\" The final confirmation the show would be produced was announced by NBC in January 2018. About the show, Fellowes stated: \\"To write The Gilded Age is the fulfillment of a personal dream, I have been fascinated by this period of American history for many years and now NBC has given me the chance to bring it to a modern audience. I could not be more excited and thrilled. The truth is, America is a wonderful country with a rich and varied history, and nothing could give me more pleasure than be the person to bring that compelling history to the screen.\\" In May 2019, the series moved from NBC to HBO, with a straight to series order. =Casting= In September 2019, the production announced an initial cast consisting of Christine Baranski, Cynthia Nixon, Amanda Peet and Morgan Spector. In November 2019, it was announced that Den√©e Benton, Louisa Jacobson, Taissa Farmiga, Blake Ritson and Simon Jones would be joining the show. In January 2020, Harry Richardson, Thomas Cocquerel and Jack Gilpin were cast as series regulars, with Jeanne Tripplehorn cast in a recurring role. In April, Carrie Coon was cast as Bertha Russell to replace Peet, who no longer will be available when production resumes after delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

People with Disability in Luxembourg have some legal protections from discrimination and their needs can be provided through various government policies. Students with disabilities have a fairly good rate of completing school compared to peers without a disability. Luxembourg signed onto the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities on March 30, 2007. Much of the country is accessible, however, there are no legal provisions for reasonable accommodations.  Demographics  People with disabilities living in poverty in Luxembourg has increased since 2010. However, the rate of poverty was lower than in other European countries at 2 percent in 2011. In 2011, the unemployment rate for people with disabilities in the country was at 21 points. People with severe disabilities had a 39 percent unemployment rate in the country.  Policy  Luxembourg has largely used a medical model of disability in its policies and legislation regarding people with disabilities. Starting in 1989, the government decided to centralize agencies and policies for people with disabilities and put it together in the Ministry of Family Affairs, Integration and for the Greater Region. Luxembourg's 2012 national plan contained measures to improve the lives of people with disabilities. Luxembourg's Employment Code specifies that businesses with more than 25 employees must hire a certain percentage of people with disabilities. People with severe disabilities and children are able to access a disability allowance. The allowance for children, Allocation suppl√©mentaire pour enfant handicap√©, is provided when a child's mental or physical capacity is reduced by 50 percent. Adult residents of Luxembourg that are at least 30 percent disabled and unable to work can be recognized as a disabled worker and receive Revenu pour personne gravement handicap√©e. Individuals who require a caregiver can receive Assurance d√©pendance. German Sign Language was recognized as an official language in May of 2017. = Non-governmental organizations = Info- Handicap was created in April 1993 when 16 different disability organizations came together to work with the government. The organization grew to include 55 member groups over time. = Legislation = Luxembourg signed onto the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities on March 30, 2007. Law No. 169 on the rights of persons with disabilities was passed on July 28, 2011. Under European Union directives, the country is prevented from firing a worker based on their disability status. The two relevant directives are 2000/43/EC and 2000/78/EC. = Education = In Luxembourg, students with a disability are generally slightly less likely to complete various levels of education than people without a disability. Special education classes are also available for migrant children and children living in poverty who may have \\"language-related deprivations.\\" Refugees also receive special education as needed.  Accessibility  Seen in front of a house in Walferdange at a parking space for a disabled person (third plate from top): Si vous prenez ma place prenez aussi mon handicap: \\"When you take my parking spot, also take my disability.\\" As of 2017, there were no legal rights to reasonable accommodation in Luxembourg. Rollibus, a door-to-door taxi bus, is available in the city of Luxembourg for individuals who use wheelchairs. Most city streets and rail stations are equipped for people with disabilities. Buses are also able to accommodate people with disabilities and guide dogs ride buses for free. Parking spaces for people with disabilities are clearly marked and people using the spots must display their credentials with a European Union blue badge.  Cultural attitudes  According to a 2019 report from the Centre for Equal Treatment (Centre pour l‚Äô√©galit√© de traitement CET), the most common type of discrimination in the country is against people with disabilities. In 2019, it was found that 25 percent of discrimination cases were due to discrimination against people with disabilities. Large companies have been found to not keep up with the Employment Code which specifies that any business with more than 25 percent of employees must hire a certain number of people with disabilities.

He lives and works in Yaound√© (Cameroon). Biography La passerelle de Bessengue, Douala. A self-taught visual artist, Alioum Moussa expresses himself through several media: primarily in painting but also performance, installation and assemblages of objects. In recent years, he has been experimenting with theatrical scenery. His career began in 1993, when he won the award for best Cameroonian artisan at a competition organized by the Ministry of Commerce. He has been honing himself through varied workshops in different parts of the world and at many residencies, IAAB (Basel, Switzerland) in 2006, to the University of Ideas, organized by the Pistoletto Foundation (Biella, Italy) in 2010. He received an artist‚Äôs visa from AFAA/Culturesfrance in 2007. In 2010, he won the Illy contest and his design was selected to decorate coffee canisters on display and for sale. His gaze is filled with humor for the human being and the apparent monotony of being that masks its facetious figures. Over time his gaze has sharpened more and more on political themes, questioning the role of Africa in globalization. Moussa works with the materials he finds, whether acrylics or mud. His latest explorations are based on the recycling of textiles, wax print fabrics or cotton clothing (T-shirts). By using second hand clothing as his principle medium, Moussa takes a stand against Africa being the dumping grounds of the industrial fashion world. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm talking about the manipulation of the thrift store circuit. Second hand clothing plays an important role in the economy, the purchasing power. (...) The hidden face of the thrift store (...) kind of translates into the relations between the West and Africa.‚Äù ReferencesBibliography * Africultures, Alioum Moussa. * Gilvin, A.
