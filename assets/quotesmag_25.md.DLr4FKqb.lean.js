The species was first collected in 1930, has only been collected on two other occasions and photographed a few other times. It was, however, not formally described until 2007. No living examples of this species have been observed since 6 October 2000.  Description  Drakaea andrewsiae is only known from photographs and a few specimens of the flower and stem. Presumably it is similar to others in the genus in having a single, ground hugging leaf and an underground tuber. The stem is long and the stalk of the single flower is long. Its flower is also similar to those of other hammer orchids in that the labellum resembles a flightless female thynnid wasp however it can be distinguished by having a spine on the column, a labellum with an erect tip on the end of the \\"tail\\", and a \\"body\\" that is spotted and densely covered with hair. The sepal at the back of the flower is long and the two at the sides are . The petals are also long. The insect-like labellum has a head about one-quarter as long as the body and its stalk. Collections were made and photographs taken in September or the first week of October, reflecting the most likely flowering period.  Taxonomy and naming  The first collection of Drakaea andrewsiae was made on 7 September 1930 by Mrs. P. Andrews near Gnowangerup. That specimen was forwarded to Dr. Rogers in Adelaide but not formally described at that time. Two other collections were made in the Gnowangerup and Tunney districts and photographs were taken in the Porongurups and Stirling Range. The first formal description was made by Stephen Hopper and Andrew Brown in 2007 using the Adelaide specimen as the type. Their description was published in Australian Systematic Botany. The specific epithet (andrewsiae) honours the type collector, Mrs. Andrews.  Distribution and habitat  The lost hammer orchid is only known from areas between Gnowangerup and Tunney. It presumably grows in sandy soil, as do all the other Drakaea, and from evidence in photographs, possibly near granite rocks.  Conservation  Drakaea andrewsiae is classified as \\"Priority One\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife. meaning that it is known from only one or a few locations which are potentially at risk.

Her most important works were the interiors for the SS America and the SS United States, which was the fastest passenger liner of all time. She worked closely with William Francis Gibbs, one of America‚Äôs most renowned naval architects, and her own firm Smyth, Urquhart, & Marckwald, the only firm run by women to decorate the interior of such ships. The interiors of the SS United States were especially innovative because of the use of entirely flame- retardant materials. In total, Marckwald completed the interiors of thirty-one ships, and revolutionized luxury ocean liner design along the way.  Beginnings  Dorothy Marckwald graduated from the Packer Collegiate Institute in Brooklyn, New York in 1916. She was a tall, attractive woman who walked with grace and confidence, and was determined to succeed in any aspect of her life. After graduating from the Packer Institute, she studied Interior Design at the New York School of Fine and Applied Arts, now known as the Parsons School of Design. Marckwald‚Äôs career began in 1920 when she was hired by Elsie Cobb Wilson, an extremely influential interior designer of the early 20th century, as an assistant designer for her firm. She started out by designing high-end homes, hotels, country clubs, offices, ranches and yachts in Washington D.C. and New York City. In 1930, Marckwald was assigned to head the interior decoration of the Grace Line‚Äôs four new 9,000-ton South American ocean liners, the Santa Elena, Santa Lucia, Santa Paula, and Santa Rosa, which proved to be a turning point in her career. Together with Anne Urquhart and William Francis Gibbs, whom Marckwald grants her success to and considers a mentor, she completed the luxurious country club-styled interiors of the four ships to much praise. This popularity led Wilson to add Marckwald and Urquhart as full-fledged partners in 1933, changing the firm name to Elsie Cobb Wilson and Company. With Wilson‚Äôs retirement in 1937 and the addition of former colleague Miriam Smyth, the firm of Smyth, Urquhart & Marckwald was formed.  SS America  In 1938, Gibbs enlisted the women to design the interiors of the SS America, a new commission for the United States Lines and one of the biggest in shipbuilding history. The design involved 23 public rooms, 395 state rooms, and eight luxury suites. According to many ship lovers of the time, it was also the most beautifully decorated liner to fly the American flag. Marckwald chose to forego the traditional Southwest style of current passenger ships in favor of a modernist look ideal for the future, utilizing light color schemes and new materials such as Lucite and aluminum. The new style was revolutionary and became the new standard of American ocean liner design, garnering the nickname ‚ÄúDot Marckwald modern.‚Äù  SS United States  Marckwald had one of the highest honors of being chosen to design the interiors of the SS United States. Designed by William Francis Gibbs and completed in 1952, it was the fastest and largest passenger ship ever built at the time. The main purpose of the ship was to transport large numbers of soldiers across seas as quickly as possible, and achieved this goal due in part to the extensive use of aluminum in its construction, which is lighter than more commonly used wood. No wood was used in the framing, accessories, decorations or interior surfaces of the ship in order to deter the possibility of fire. Marckwald and Urquhart faced several challenges when designing the interior of the ship, including working around obstacles that come with a ship moving at speeds that had not yet been developed and coming up with a design that was lightweight and entirely fireproof. This led to the use of innovative materials such as aluminum, fiberglass, and Dynel throughout the ships‚Äô 26 public rooms, 674 state rooms, and 20 luxury suites. The color schemes were chosen to limit seasickness and remind the passengers that they were setting to sea, furniture was designed to fit specifically to its assigned location, and decorative artwork was intended to emphasize America. After three years‚Äô work and despite the challenges, the ship‚Äôs finished interior was fresh, modern, and, ultimately, safe. With its elegant interiors and state of the art technology, the SS United States was a must for high ranking individuals in society and was the way to travel between America and Europe. Some of its famous passengers included John F. Kennedy, Walt Disney, Salvador Dali, and Marilyn Monroe, among many others. It is also famed for transporting the Mona Lisa to France after it was on display in the National Gallery of Art in Washington D.C. and the Metropolitan Art Museum in New York City. In the time since its glory days, the SS United States Conservancy has saved the ship from being scrapped and is determined to restore it to its full luxury standard. However, with budget troubles in the way, the future of the ship and Marckwald‚Äôs once sophisticated interiors is currently unclear. Ideas for repurposing the ships‚Äô 600,000 square feet include luxury condos, a mixed-use space consisting of a hotel, shops, and restaurants, or a hub for tech companies to house their businesses.  Other Works  Between and after working on the SS America and SS United States, Marckwald found the time to work on a few other projects, such as decorating a railroad car for the Santa Fe railroad in 1949, renovating the home of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor in the Bahamas, and designing two new ships for the Grace Line in 1955, the Santa Paula and the Santa Rosa.

Shiva appeared to him and informed that he had to continue his penance till Sambandar visits the place and sings praise of him. The deity at the Urugeswarar temple was thus originally Vishnu, who was mesmerized by the devotion of Sambandar and changed to Shiva. It is believed that the 108 Rudras performed penance at this place and hence it is called \\"Ananda Rudresam\\" and \\"Maha Rudresam\\". Appar and Sambandar, the 7th-century Tamil Saivite poet, venerated Metralinathar in one verse each in Tevaram, compiled as the First Tirumurai. As the temple is revered in Tevaram, it is classified as Paadal Petra Sthalam, one of the 275 temples that find mention in the Saiva canon. Sundarar mentions that Shiva prefers to reside at this most happening place. There are no historical evidence to assess the exact time the temple was built. There is an inscription in the temple indicating benevolent contributions from during the 13th century by Later Cholas to expand the temple. Architecture Shrine of the temple The temple is located in Pillayarpalayam area of Kanchipuram. Metraleeswarar temple complex has two prakarams (outer courtyard) and a three- tiered rajagopuram (gateway tower) facing West. The central shrine faces West and holds the image of Metraleeswarar (Shiva) in the form of lingam made of granite. The temples in Kanchipuram have no separate shrine of Parvathi as it is believed that Kamakshi of Kanchipuram is the common Parvathi shrine for all Shiva temples. But this temple has a separate shrine for Parvathi in the form of Metralinayagi. The granite images of Nandi (the bull and vehicle of Shiva) and the flagstaff is located axial to the sanctum. As in other Shiva temples of Tamil Nadu, the first precinct or the walls around the sanctum of Metraleeswarar has images of Dakshinamurthy (Shiva as the Teacher), Durga (warrior-goddess) and Chandikeswarar (a saint and devotee of Shiva). The temple precinct is surrounded by granite walls. There is a separate shrine for Othu Urugeeswarar which is axial to the main entrance. During the weekly and yearly festivals, Kachabeswarar is given importance over the presiding deity Metraleeswarar. Worship and religious practises Shrine of Metraleeswarar The temple priests perform the puja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. The temple rituals are performed four times a day; Kalasanthi at 8:00 a.m., Uchikalam at 12 p.m. and Sayarakshai at 6:00 p.m and Arthajamam at 8:00 p.m. Each ritual comprises four steps: abhisheka (sacred bath), alangaram (decoration), naivethanam (food offering) and deepa aradanai (waving of lamps) for both Metraleeswarar and Metralainayagi Amman. There are weekly rituals like ' (Monday) and ' (Friday), fortnightly rituals like pradosham and monthly festivals like amavasai (new moon day), kiruthigai, pournami (full moon day) and sathurthi. Thirugnana Sambanda Gurupuja and Panguni Uthiram during March - April are the most prominent festivals celebrated in the temple. The Thirukarthikai during (November - December), Mahashivarathri during February - March and Kanthasashti are the other major festivals celebrated in the temple.

Software The Honor 4X comes preinstalled with Android 4.4.2 KitKat with Huawei's custom Emotion UI. The launcher does not include an app drawer, with apps spread across multiple home screens, thus the interface resembles iOS more than Android. Huawei plans an upgrade to Android Lollipop and marshmallow. A simple home screen style is also available. Reception The Huawei Honor 4X received generally positive reviews. Tomos Ellis of TechRadar reviewed the version with the octa-core processor, and gave the Honor 4X a 4 out of 5. The review praised the performance of the 64-bit octa-core processor and 2 GB of RAM, long battery life provided with the 3000 mAh battery, dual-sim functionality, good build quality and camera quality, and opined that the online-only availability was likely to reduce costs, but criticized the lack of an app drawer in the custom Emotion UI Android skin, noting that separating apps across multiple homescreens was \\"too cluttered\\" and that the icons were \\"garish, cartoon- like\\". The review also noted that while competitors like the 2014 Moto G and Sony Xperia M2 Aqua exist in a similar price range, none of them were phablet- sized like the Honor 4X. Katharine Byrne of Expert Reviews reviewed the version with the octa-core processor, and also gave the Honor 4X a 4 out of 5, comparing the device favorably against the 2014 Moto G. The review appreciated the camera, saying that the outdoor photo quality was \\"much brighter and more vivid\\" than photos taken with the Moto G, and that the Honor 4X also has longer battery life and higher benchmark, web browsing, and graphics performance. The review noted that the display had high brightness and contrast, but criticized the colour accuracy, noting low sRGB colour gamut coverage. Komal Mohan of The Times of India reviewed the version with the slower quad-core processor, and gave the Honor 4X a 3.5 out of 5. The review noted that the lack of backlighting for the capacitive front keys are an inconvenience, and said that the device \\"is on the chunky side\\" with its thickness of 8.7 mm. The sunlight legibility and touch sensitivity of the display were praised, but the viewing angles were disappointing. The review pointed out that the device's 3000 mAh battery was \\"one of its biggest strengths\\", but said that the Adreno 306 GPU of the quad-core Snapdragon 410 processor created noticeable lag when playing resource-intensive games.

Foundation The first convention of the National Association of Colored Graduate Nurses, Boston, 1909 In 1906, Connecticut nurse Martha Minerva Franklin surveyed African American nurses to see what challenges they faced as a group. Franklin determined that the prestigious American Nurses Association was technically open to African American members, but many State Nurses Associations refused to admit black members. State-level membership was required to join the American Nurses Association and thus, many qualified African American nurses were barred from full membership in the national association. In 1908, fifty- two nurses, including Martha Minerva Franklin and Adah Belle Samuels Thoms, met in New York City and decided to start the NACGN. Franklin was elected president at the first meeting. As they left the meeting they had three main goals: ‚Äúto advance the standards and best interests of trained nurses, to break down discrimination in the nursing profession, and to develop leadership within the ranks of black nurses. \\"To do this, the acting presidents of the NACGN not only actively fought for integration by other means but also attended the annual ANA conference to bring awareness to the topic. In 1912, the NACGN had 125 members. By 1920, that number has risen to 500. Adah Belle Samuels Thoms served as the first treasurer of the NACGN before taking over the presidency of the organization in 1916. Toms established a national jobs registry to help black nurses find employment and established the association's first headquarters. During World War I, Thoms campaigned for the American Red Cross to admit African American nurses. This was important because the American Red Cross was the only avenue into the United States Army Nurse Corps. According to Jane Delano, chair of the National Committee on Red Cross Nursing service, the Red Cross was willing to admit black nurses, but the Surgeon General was not. Nurse Frances Reed Elliot was enrolled in the Red Cross in July 1918 but was not immediately assigned. It took the 1918 flu pandemic and the resulting nurse shortage to finally integrate the United States Army Nurse Corps. In December 1918, eighteen African American nurses were appointed to the United States Army Nurse Corps. They were assigned to Camp Grant and Camp Sherman with full rank and pay. Although the patients were not segregated and the nurses were assigned to all services, the African American nurses were housed separately from the white nurses. Carrie E. Bullock served as NACGN president from 1927 to 1930. Bullock worked to increase communication and community among black nurses. In 1928, she founded and edited the NACGN's official newsletter, The National News Bulletin. Mabel Keaton Staupers became the first paid executive secretary of the National Association of Colored Graduate Nurses in 1934. Stauper's most important accomplishment was the further integration of US military nurses. In 1946, Stauper resigned and her replacement Alma Vessels John was hired. She would shepherd the organization until its dissolution in 1951. From 1934 to 1939, Estelle Massey Osborne was NACGN's president. World War II Initially, the War Department announced that there would be no black nurses called to serve the United States Army Nurse Corps. Staupers and other activists petitioned for the rights of black nurses and served on the NACGN Special Defense Committee. In January 1941, the Army announced a quota of fifty-six black nurses to work at the black military installations at Camp Livingston and Fort Bragg. Staupers continued to campaign for greater inclusion, meeting with Eleanor Roosevelt, white nursing groups, military leaders, and black advocates. By 1943, the number of black nurses serving in the armed forces had increased from 56 to 160. By the end of the war, the War Department was drafting all qualified nurses, regardless of race. In 1943, Congresswoman Frances P. Bolton (R-OH) introduced a bill to create government grants for nursing programs in order to increase the number of trained nurses available during World War II. The Bolton Act (1943) forbid discrimination and brought about an increase in the number of black nursing students in the country. Professional organizations slowly began to increase membership opportunities for black women. In 1942, the National League of Nursing Education changed its by-laws to allow applicants barred from state leagues to directly join the national organization. Follow the national change, several state Leagues of Nursing Education began admitting black members. By the end of World War II there were only 2.9 percent black nurses (compared to blacks making up 10 percent of the population) or eight thousand registered black nurses in the United States. Integration with the American Nurses Association During the civil rights movement in the late 1940s and 1950s more nursing schools were accepting black applicants. Estelle Osborne wrote in the Journal of Negro Education that in 1941, 29 United States nursing schools had a nondiscrimination policy and by 1949 that number was up to 354. In 1949, the members of the National Association of Colored Graduate Nurses unanimously voted to accept a proposed merger with the American Nurses Association. NACGN membership voted the NACGN out of existence in 1951. Notable members * Carrie E.

It was written by DiBlasi and Scott Poiley, both of whom produced along with Mary Poiley. Juliana Harkavy stars as a rookie police officer who is tasked with taking the last shift at a police station before it is permanently closed. Strange events lead her to believe that it may be haunted. It premiered at the London FrightFest Film Festival on October 25, 2014, and was released to video-on-demand on October 6, 2015.  Plot  Jessica Loren, a rookie police officer on her first assignment, is ordered to take the last shift at a police station before it is permanently closed. Her mother pleads with her not to take the job, as her father, also a police officer, was killed on duty. After assuring her mother, Loren reports for duty and her commanding officer Cohen, leads her on a brief tour, during which he explains that a HAZMAT team will be there to collect evidence that is difficult to dispose of and that she is not permitted to leave her post. Before he leaves, he gives Loren his phone number in case of emergency. Loren becomes bored and almost falls asleep, though she wakes when she hears knocking. She does not see anyone at the door but finds a homeless man in the hallway; he urinates on the floor and refuses to leave. Loren takes him to a holding cell, where the door suddenly closes and locks behind her. The lights go out, a bloody-faced person surprises her in the door's window, and she drops her flashlight. An unidentified person picks it up and taunts her. When the lights come back on, the door opens and no one is there. Loren is further unsettled when she sees chairs and doors moving on their own, ghostly figures, and hears voices singing. She also receives a series of distress calls from a woman named Monica Young, who says she has been taken hostage by a cult; the police dispatcher confirms that all emergency calls have been rerouted to the new station. Loren encounters a loiterer, Marigold, who tells her that she was in a cell when the police brought in an infamous cult, led by the charismatic John Michael Paymon. Marigold says the story told to the public, that the cult was killed at their residence, is untrue; instead, they committed suicide at the station one year ago to the day. Marigold leaves after, humming the song Loren heard earlier. Further paranormal events at the station reveal that the cult worships the king of Hell, a being also named Paimon. Before committing mass suicide, Paymon threatened to come back and destroy everything. Ryan Price, a fellow police officer, arrives at the station, and Loren accuses him of planning the events as a hazing ritual. Confused, he insists he has come by to check up on her, as he had served with her father. Price confirms that the murderous cult was captured alive and tells her that her father, who died apprehending them, would be proud of her. As he leaves, Loren sees a bullet wound in the back of his head and he disappears. After seeing several visions of the cultists and their victims, Loren calls Cohen and says that she cannot finish her shift but repents when he threatens to fire her. The dispatcher tells Loren that Monica was the final victim of Paymon's cult and died over a year ago. A living member of the Paymon cult takes Loren hostage, only to die by suicide in front of her. Loren tries to leave but the glass does not break when shot. Her dead father calls her and demands justice for his death, and she returns to the holding cell to find the homeless man hanged. Her father calls again to warn her of cult members assaulting the station, and she kills them. As she shoots the last one, Cohen shoots her from behind. In a moment of clarity, she realizes that she has murdered the entire HAZMAT team. Cohen calls for medical assistance, and Loren is approached by the spirits of Paymon and his cultists as she bleeds out.

The film was designed to be experienced from Harkavy's point of view, which keeps the audience wondering whether the events are all in her mind. Shooting took place in Sanford, Florida, in an abandoned police station. DiBlasi was influenced by the action film Assault on Precinct 13 (1976), the horror film A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984), and the Charles Manson documentary Manson (1973).

Sensible heat into the space causes its air temperature to rise while latent heat is associated with the rise of the moisture content in the space. The building design, internal equipment, occupants, and outdoor weather conditions may affect the cooling load in a building using different heat transfer mechanisms. The SI units are watts.  Overview  The cooling load is calculated to select HVAC equipment that has the appropriate cooling capacity to remove heat from the zone. A zone is typically defined as an area with similar heat gains, similar temperature and humidity control requirements, or an enclosed space within a building with the purpose to monitor and control the zone's temperature and humidity with a single sensor e.g. thermostat. Cooling load calculation methodologies take into account heat transfer by conduction, convection, and radiation. Methodologies include heat balance, radiant time series, cooling load temperature difference, transfer function, and sol-air temperature. Methods calculate the cooling load in either steady state or dynamic conditions and some can be more involved than others. These methodologies and others can be found in ASHRAE handbooks, ISO Standard 11855, European Standard (EN) 15243, and EN 15255. ASHRAE recommends the heat balance method and radiant time series methods.  Differentiation from heat gains  The cooling load of a building should not be confused with its heat gains. Heat gains refer to the rate at which heat is transferred into or generated inside a building. Just like cooling loads, heat gains can be separated into sensible and latent heat gains that can occur through conduction, convection, and radiation. Thermophysical properties of walls, floors, ceilings, and windows, lighting power density (LPD), plug load density, occupant density, and equipment efficiency play an important role in determining the magnitude of heat gains in a building. ASHRAE handbook of fundamentals refers to the following six modes of entry for heat gains: # Solar radiation through transparent surfaces # Heat conduction through exterior walls and roofs # Heat conduction through ceilings, floors, and interior partitions # Heat generated in the space by occupants, lights, and appliances # Energy transfer through direct-with-space ventilation and infiltration of outdoor air # Miscellaneous heats gains Furthermore, heat extraction rate is the rate at which heat is actually being removed from the space by the cooling equipment. Heat gains, heat extraction rate, and cooling loads values are often not equal due to thermal inertia effects. Heat is stored in the mass of the building and furnishings delaying the time at which it can become a heat gain and be extracted by the cooling equipment to maintain the desired indoor conditions. Another reason is that the inability of the cooling system to keep dry bulb temperature and humidity constant.  Cooling loads in air systems  In air systems, convective heat gains are assumed to become a cooling load instantly. Radiative heat gains are absorbed by walls, floors, ceilings, and furnishings causing an increase in their temperature which will then transfer heat to the space's air by convection. Conductive heat gains are converted to convective and radiative heat gains. If the space's air temperature and humidity are kept constant then heat extraction rate and space cooling load are equal. The resulting cooling load through different air system types in the same built environment can be different.  Cooling loads in radiant systems  In radiant systems, not all convective heat gains become a cooling load instantly because radiant system has limitations on how much heat can be removed from the zone through convection. Radiative heat gains are absorbed by active and non-active cooling surfaces.

Alcanada, pronounced as 'Aucanada' in Catal√°n and in mallorqu√≠n languages, gave its name to the seaside area stretching from the Port d'Alcudia to the Cap de Menorca. The place name most likely came from Albecanata (Al-kaddan) ‚Äìas it was known in the Llibre del Repartiment (Majorca) (1232). Alcanada's general view History=Alcanada's farmstead Alcanada's main houses It appears that in the first centuries of our era there was a small Roman settlement in Alcanada's area, connected to the Roman city of Pollentia (Alc√∫dia) the ancient capital city of the Baleares Islands. Later on, during the Muslim rule of Mallorca (9th-13th centuries), the farmstead of Alcanada was established. After the Balearic Islands were conquered by the Crown of Aragon, the farmstead ended up in the hands of Mr. Pere Ferrandiz, and as of the 14th century the land and the islet of Alcanada became communal property. Residents were allowed to graze their herds, collect firewood, harvest fan palm leaves, hunt, and gather snails. From the 16th century on, they were able to rent plots of farmland, known as rotes, in the communal property of Alcanada. Alcanada's emblem Mart√≠ Torrens, Guillem Torrens, and Antoni Fe were some of the owners of the main house of Alcanada. It included simple, two-story constructions that combined their agricultural functions with that of sheltering the workers of the estate. A document from the Municipal Archives of Alc√∫dia shows that in 1857 the house was inhabited by a family with three children, in addition to four shepherds and one servant. In the 1862 amullaramiento land tax records, the Alcanada estate is described as an area of 150 quarterades (106 hectares) with almond, carob, grain, olive, and fig crops, as well as vineyards, pine forest, and scrubland; its owner is listed as ‚ÄúD. Antonio Morey de Palma.‚Äù From that same period, we have the description that the Archduke Ludwig Salvator of Austria included in his work Die Balearen: ‚ÄúA path heads up from the Port of Alc√∫dia, first following the coast in the direction of the bay of Alcanada or Aucanada, and of the house of the same name with its underground spring from which a pump draws water leading to several watering troughs. A large vineyard lies at its feet, and the terraced fields on both sides are planted with carob and fig trees. Wild olive has spread into the nearby scrubland. The house is simple, with a tower and a terrace of paved stones with the shape of a star in the middle. An inscription on the well reads \\"Alcanada 1844.\\" Today, the main house and its adjoining outbuildings have been restored and adapted to their current use as a golf club and restaurant, although some of the spaces have been kept in their original form. Sa Bassa Blanca The estate known as Sa Bassa Blanca, by a stream with the same name, is located between the main house of the Alcanada estate and the Cap de Menorca. For its design, the Egyptian architect Hassan Fathy sought inspiration in the Muslim fortresses known as ribats, although he preserved the thick stone walls from the original farm building. The main entrance is through \\"el Cam√≠ de Muntanya\\" (The Mountain Road) and this road starts from Mal Pas area, no entrance by the sea. Sa Bassa Blanca houses the headquarters of the Fundacion Yannick y Ben Jakober, and holds a heterogeneous series of art collections that are open to the public. The exhibition rooms located in the main building feature works involved in the art movements of the second half of the 20th century. The former water deposit houses the permanent collection, which includes over 150 portraits of children painted between the 16th and the 19th centuries. Most of the paintings show children from the European royalty or nobility. Torre Major Torre Major To fend off the pirate attacks, the mathematician and priest Joan Binimelis (1538-1616) devised a system of watchtowers along the Balearic coast with a code of signals that warned about the approach of pirate ships. The guards would light fires on the terraces of the towers, using smoke signals by day and fires by night, or even cannon shots, to warn the local population to prepare their defense. The Torre Major marks the beginning of Alcanada. The name of the tower dates back to the times when the bay of Alc√∫dia was known as Port Major. The entrance is crowned with the coat of arms of King Philip III of Spain, carved in 1602 by the sculptor Antoni Verger. Stretching from the Torre Major to the Penya Roja watchtower, almost nine kilometers of steep, barren coastline had to be watched and defended for hundreds of years‚Äìparticularly beginning in the 16th century, when the Balearics were attacked by Berbers and pirates who plundered towns and houses and captured their inhabitants for ransom. The captives could spend years on end in North African lands, until they were eventually exchanged, sold, or their ransom was paid, sometimes collected from alms. There are chronicles of an attack on Cap del Pinar in 1551, when 25 Mallorcans were taken hostage and whose ransom of two thousand escudos was advanced by the University of Alc√∫dia. The islet with the lighthouse In the mid-19th century, the lighthouse was built. For one hundred years, the lighthouse keepers‚Äìsometimes with their families in tow‚Äìlived on the island, and there were times when they were actively involved in rescuing the victims of shipwrecks. Twice a week, a boat brought them supplies from the Port d'Alcudia, but at times they were isolated when ships were unable to sail due to bad weather, and their staples would run out. During the Spanish Civil War (1936‚Äì39), the population increased when soldiers were posted to guard and defend the coastline with three machine gun nests that were built on the islet. Later on, in 1960, when the lantern system was automated, the islet was uninhabited again. The architectural intervention of Nicolau M¬™ Rubi√≥ i Tudur√≠ Summer holiday village by Rubi√≥ i Tudur√≠ In 1933, captivated by the gentle landscape of Alcanada, the Menorcan-born architect Nicolau M. Rubi√≥ i Tudur√≠ (not surprisingly the director of the Municipal Institute for Parks and Gardens in Barcelona) designed a summer holiday village in this idyllic setting. Rubi√≥ was drawn to the notion of garden cities and summer holiday resorts inspired by vernacular architecture, as promoted by the new architectural trends of the first third of the 20th century. Hence, his project for the development at Alcanada sought to emulate a fishermen's village, with its traditional shacks, narrow streets, and alleyways, even including an old quarter and a newer settlement. At the center of the development stood the Hotel del Sol, currently the Hotel President, which offered several rooms and a restaurant for the residents of the development The horticulturalist and rose grower Pedro Dot, a good friend of Rubi√≥, built the first house in the residential development. Right away, in just one year, forty other houses were built. Several years later, Pere Dot devoted the rose 'Perla de Alcanada' to this spot. In addition to Rubi√≥ himself, the Sampol family‚Äìthe owners of the Alcanada estate‚Äìwere involved as the contractors for the development. The Spanish Civil War brought construction work to a halt; the project was left unfinished and in a semi-abandoned state for a decade. It took off again in the 1950, however, by then, the urban planning regulations allowed for buildings that deviated from Rubi√≥'s initial plan, thus distorting the project, with the exception of the original center. The ensemble of houses nestled around Cala Pon√ßet has survived and preserves the atmosphere of a fishermen's village that turned into one of Alcanada's trademarks.

She travelled with 103 other convicts on 6 June 1821 and arrived in Hobart on 7 January 1822. The town of Mount Eliza near Melbourne is named after her.  Early life  Callaghan had roots in Ennis, County Clare, Ireland. She worked as a servant. It has been said that her family of origin were land owners and her grandfather of exceptional wealth. There appears to be some separation of Elizabeth‚Äôs father from her grandparents and suggestions that her father was a very unhappy man. Her mother was an elegant, learned and strong lady of exceptional character. The family struggled, and Callaghan was sent on her way at just seventeen. Beautiful, elegant, fiery and learned ‚Äì her mother was confident that she would easily find her place in the world.  Criminal record  An example of an English ¬£1 banknote (1814) (Gloucester Old Bank note for Charles Evans & James Fell) On 13 September 1820 Callaghan was tried for \\"felonious disposal of and putting away a forged and counterfeit bank note for ¬£1 with intent to defraud the Bank of England\\" at the Middlesex Gaol Delivery (Old Bailey), London, England. She was sentenced to 14 years (death commuted) and was transported to New South Wales, arriving on 18 December 1821. On 27 March 1822, she committed an offence of being drunk and disorderly and was in HM Gaol for one week. She had to wear an iron collar for the period and to sit in stocks twice, two hours at each time. She committed another offence on June 25 when she was caught sneaking out of her master‚Äôs premises on the 24th and remained absent all night. She was sentenced to sit in stocks for three hours that day. In 1823, Callaghan committed an offence when she was absent from her master‚Äôs premises one day and night. She was punished for a week, with bread and water rations and had to sit in the stocks for two hours each day.  Family  Callaghan's husband John Batman Callaghan married John Batman on 29 March 1828 in St John's, Launceston, Tasmania. The couple had seven daughters and a son. Their only son, John Charles Batman, died aged just 8 or 9 years old by drowning in the Yarra River on 11 January 1845. Batman became ill around 1835, and in February 1839 Elizabeth sailed to England. He died on 6 May 1839 but she only heard of this when she returned to Australia in March 1840. His will left her only ¬£5, which she and her second husband challenged in a lengthy but unsuccessful lawsuit. After Batman died, Callaghan married William Willoughby, her former husband's clerk in 1841. In July 1853 her daughter, Elizabeth Mary, described her late mother as \\"Elizabeth Callan, governess\\".  Death and legacy  Callaghan was murdered in 1852 in Geelong, being beaten and kicked to death in a bar-room brawl. At this time she was known as Sara Willoughby and had been described as \\"of somewhat abandoned character\\".

It is of Aarne-Thompson type 513A (\\"Six Go through the Whole World\\"). Synopsis An evil Queen is a sorceress who has a beautiful princess daughter. She offers her hand in marriage, but all suitors have to fulfill impossible tasks. None of them ever managed to bring those to a good end, so she has all who failed beheaded. One day, a prince hears about the princess and wants to compete to win her hand. At first his father forbids him to do so, but the son falls ill for seven years without a physician being able to help him. Only when the father allows him to go does his health improve. During his voyage the prince meets six men with amazing talents and powers, whom he all takes along to be his servants. The first one is a man with a belly as huge as a small mountain who is able to stretch himself out to even bigger obesity. The second is a man who is able to hear even the tiniest sound, demonstrated by the fact that when the prince meets him he is listening to the grass growing and can also hear someone being beheaded in the evil Queen's castle. The third servant is an incredibly tall man. The fourth one a man who wears a blindfold in front of his eyes because his glance is so powerful that it makes everything he sees split to pieces. The fifth servant is a man who feels cold in extreme heat and hot in extreme frost. The sixth and final servant is a man who can stretch his long neck to see over long distances. The prince and his servants arrive at the Queen's castle. He is told to fulfill three tasks to gain her daughter's hand in marriage. First he has to fetch a ring which the Queen dropped in the Red Sea. The man with the sharp eyesight notices the ring, hanging on a pointy rock. The obese man drinks the sea dry, whereupon the tall man picks the ring up with ease. The Queen is surprised that they managed to safely perform the first task, but orders the second task next. The prince has to eat three hundred oxen, skin, hair, bones, horns and all, and drink three hundred casks of wine to the last drop. If any trace of these are found then he will lose his life. The prince asks whether he's allowed to have one guest join him and his wish is granted. Naturally he brings the obese servant along and in less than no time everything is finished. For the final task the prince has to guard the princess in her room with his arms around her. If the Queen returns around the clock of midnight and the princess is no longer in his arms, then his life will be lost. The prince takes precautions by having the Tall servant and Obese servant surround him and the princess, so that nobody can touch them. However, the Queen casts a spell over them, which sets them off into a deep sleep. She then carries the princess away. At a quarter to twelve everybody awakes and the prince panics. The man with the amazing sense of hearing listens and hears her crying on a rock, three hundred leagues away. The Tall One rises, takes a few steps and runs towards them, taking the servant with the sharp eyesight with him. The latter looks at the rock, causing it to shatter into a thousand pieces, while the Tall One grabs the princess and brings her back before deadline. With all three tasks fulfilled the Queen whispers in the princess' ear that it's a shame that she has to obey common people and not being allowed to choose a husband to her own liking. This makes the princess angry. Next day she orders three hundred great bundles of wood to be lit on fire. If someone is able to sit in the midst of the wood and bear the fire then she'll truly marry him. The servant who can't stand cold fulfills the task, still shivering as the flames have burnt out. Now the princess can not stop the prince from marrying her. As they drive off to church, the evil Queen sends her soldiers after them to stop them. The servant with the amazing sense of hearing hears her plan and tells the others. The obese servant spits out all the water he had drunk before, drowning all the soldiers. A next legion of soldiers is stopped by the servant with the amazing eyesight looking at them and shooting them to smithereens. After that, the marriage is held without any further problems and all the servants go their own separate ways. Returning to his kingdom, the prince lies to his bride that he is actually a swineherd. He forces his bride to work in extreme poverty and misery for eight days, causing her to believe it is what she deserved for being so proud and haughty. Then she is brought to the palace, where the prince reveals it was all just a ploy to have her suffer just as much for him as he did for her. Then they marry as prince and princess and live happily ever after. In popular culture Langnek in the Fairy Tale Forest of the Dutch theme park Efteling The fairy tale is well known in the Netherlands, thanks to it being part of several of the fairy tales exhibited in the theme park Efteling in Kaatsheuvel, Northern Brabant. A huge animatronic statue of the long-necked servant can be seen there since 1952, telling the story to all visitors on a repeated audio recording. This statue, called Langnek (\\"Longneck\\"), is also a mascot for the park. In 1955, a little pond was dug around the stone on which Long-neck sits. A bust of the servant with the sharp eyesight, Bullet-eye, with a wasp on his nose stood next to Long-neck. In the late 1950s, Bullet-eye was removed and a smaller bust of a blindfolded Bullet- eye was placed upon a kiosk near Long-neck. Long-neck received a new head in the 1970s; and in 1979, his body and neck were renewed. In 2006, safety-fences were placed near the pond. The tale is voiced by Peter Reijnders, and can be read from a book in Dutch, English, French and German. Comparisons The story is very similar to other European folk tales and fairy tales about a man with very talented servants, such as How Six Made Their Way in the World, Long, Broad and Sharpsight, The Fool of the World and the Flying Ship, How the Hermit Helped to Win the King's Daughter, The Clever Little Tailor and one of the stories in Baron Munchhausen.

Shiva is worshipped as Sathyanatheswarar and his consort Parvathi as Pramarambikai. Sathyanatheswarar is revered in the 7th-century Tamil Saiva canonical work, the Tevaram, written by Tamil saint poets known as the nayanars and classified as Paadal Petra Sthalam, the 275 temples reverred in the canon. The temple has a three-tiered rajagopuram, the entrance tower and all the shrines are enclosed in a granite wall. The temple has two daily rituals at various times from 5:30 a.m. to 8 p.m., and three yearly festivals on its calendar, namely the Margazhi Tiruvathirai during the Tamil month of Margazhi (December - January), Aipassi Annabishekam during Aippassi (October - November) and Mahashivarathri during February - March being the most prominent. The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu. Etymology and legend According to legend, Indra, the king of celestial deities and Bhudan (Venus) worshipped Shiva at this place located in a forest called Kaaraivanam. Since it was located in Kaaraivanam, the presiding deity came to be known as Karaivananathar (Sathyanatheswarar). Tirugnana Sambandar, a 7th-century Tamil Saivite poet, venerated Sathyanatheswarar in one verse in Tevaram, compiled as the First Tirumurai. As the temple is revered in Tevaram, it is classified as Paadal Petra Sthalam, one of the 275 temples that find mention in the Saiva canon. As per Hindu legend, Chandra (moon) was under the tutelage of Guru (Jupiter). He wanted to marry Guru's wife, Dhara and did a yagna seeking the boon from Vishnu. Guru attended the function with Dhara, when she was allured by Chandra. Budha was born to Chandra and Dhara. When Budha became an youngster, he came to know about his birth, felt ashamed and started doing a penance praying to Shiva to include him as one of the Navagrahas at this place. Shiva was pleased by his devotion and appeared as Sathyanatheswarar to offer him the boon. As per another legend, Indra, the king of Devas, the celestial deities, was attracted by the beauty of Ahalya, the wife of sage Gautama. He took the form of a rooster to wake the sage early in the day. The sage started his day by going to the river, leaving Ahalya alone in the house. Indra entered the house to attain Ahalya, but the sage sensed something was wrong in the day. He returned to the hermitage and saw Indra escaping as a cat. He cursed Indra to have eyes throughout his body. Indra was roaming around and started doing penance at this place to regain his appearance. Architecture The temple is located in the Thirukalimedu locality in Kanchipuram. The temple covers an area of . Sathyanatheswarar temple complex has two prakarams (outer courtyard), a lotus tank and a three-tiered rajagopuram (gateway tower) raising to a height of facing West. The central shrine faces east and holds the image of Sathyanatheswarar (Shiva) in the form of lingam made of granite and is believed to be a swayambumoorthy (self manifested). As in other temples in Kanchipuram, there is no separate shrine of Parvathi as it is believed that Kamakshi of Kanchipuram is the common Parvathi shrine for all Shiva temples. There is a shrine facing South where the festival image of Pramarambikai is housed. All the rituals performed for the deity is similar to the ones done for the presiding deity. The granite images of Nandi (the bull and vehicle of Shiva), a tall flag staff and a Balipeeta, the place of offering, axial to the sanctum. As in other Shiva temples of Tamil Nadu, the first precinct or the walls around the sanctum of Sathyanatheswarar has images of Dakshinamurthy (Shiva as the Teacher), Durga (warrior-goddess) and Chandikeswarar (a saint and devotee of Shiva). The temple precinct is surrounded by granite walls. Based on the historical significance of the temple, it was in the proposal of Archaeological Survey of India, Chennai Circle, as one of the seven temples to be included as an archaeological monument. Worship and religious practices The temple priests perform the puja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. The temple rituals are performed two times a day; Kalasanthi at 8:00 a.m. and Sayarakshai at 6:00 p.m. Each ritual comprises four steps: abhisheka (sacred bath), alangaram (decoration), naivethanam (food offering) and deepa aradanai (waving of lamps) for both Sathyanatheswarar and Pramarambikai Amman. There are weekly rituals like ' (Monday) and ' (Friday), fortnightly rituals like pradosham and monthly festivals like amavasai (new moon day), kiruthigai, pournami (full moon day) and sathurthi. The Margazhi Tiruvathirai during the Tamil month of Margazhi (December - January), Aipassi Annabishekam during Aippassi (October ‚Äì November) and Mahashivarathri during February and March are the three festivals celebrated in the temple. During Wednesdays, devotees take a holy dip in the temple tank located outside the temple and worship Shiva with green pulse, which is considered a sacred aspect for Budha (Mercury).

Moreover, one of the main agendas of media art histories is to point out the role of digital technologies for contemporary, post-industrial societies and to counteract the marginalization of according art practices and art objects: ‚Ä≥Digital technology has fundamentally changed the way art is made. Over the last forty years, media art has become a significant part of our networked information society. Although there are well-attended international festivals, collaborative research projects, exhibitions and database documentation resources, media art research is still marginal in universities, museums and archives. It remains largely under- resourced in our core cultural institutions.‚Ä≥http://www.mediaarthistory.org/declaration The term new media art itself is of great importance to the field.Rush, Michael. 2005. New Media in Art. London: Thames & HudsonTribe, Mark, Reena Jana and Uta Grosenick. 2006. New Media Art. K√∂ln: Taschen.Shanken, Edward A. 2009. Art and Electronic Media. London: Phaidon Press.Paul, Christiane. 2003. Digital Art. New York: Thames and Hudson. New media art is an umbrella term that encompasses art forms that are produced, modified and transmitted by means of digital technologies or, in a broader sense, make use of ‚Äònew‚Äô and emerging technologies that originate from a scientific, military or industrial context. The majority of authors that try to ‚Äòdelineate‚Äô the aesthetic object of new media art emphasize aspects of interactivity, processuality, multimedia, and real time. The focus of new media art lies in the cultural, political, and social implications as well as the aesthetic possibilities ‚Äì more or less its ‚Äòmedia-specificity‚Äô ‚Äì of digital media. Consequently, scholars recognize the function of media technologies in New Media Art not only as a ‚Äòcarrier‚Äô of meaning, but instead as a means that fundamentally shapes the very meaning of the artwork itself. Furthermore, the field of new media art is increasingly influenced by new technologies that surmount a traditional understanding of (art) media. This becomes apparent in regards to technologies that originate from the field of biotechnology and life science and that are employed in artistic practices such as bio art, genetic art, and transgenic art. Consequently, the term new media art does not imply a steady ‚Äògenre‚Äô of art production. Instead, it is a field that emphasizes new technologies (in order to establish an explicit difference with traditional art media and genres). The list of genres that are commonly subsumed under the label of new media art illustrates its broad scope and includes, among others, virtual art.Popper, Frank. 2007.

Resources and research projects  Since the end of the 1990s, the first online databases came into being, as exemplified by the university-based Archive of Digital Art,http://www.digitalartarchive.at/nc/home.html Rhizomehttp://rhizome.org/ platform located in New York, Netzspannunghttp://netzspannung.org/ (until 2005), the database project Comparthttp://dada.compart-bremen.de/ in which early phase of Digital Art is addressed, and the collaborative online platform Monoskop.http://monoskop.org/Monoskop In terms of institutional resources, media art histories spans diverse organisations, archives, research centres as well as private initiatives. Already at this early stage in the development of the field, the actors of media art histories were connected by way of digital communication, especially by so-called mailing lists such as Nettime or Rohrpost, both channels of communication that remain prime resources for the new media art community. In the last few years, there was a significant increase of festivals and conferences dedicated to new media art, though the dominant festivals in the field continue to be the Ars Electronica, the Transmediale, the ISEA (Inter-Society for the Electronic Arts), and SIGGRAPH (Special Interest Group on Graphics and Interactive Techniques). To this day, museums and research facilities specializing in New Media Art are the exception. Nevertheless, ZKM (Zentrum f√ºr Kunst und Medientechnologie) or specific focuses in collections (including the Whitney Museum, the New York Museum of Modern Art, or the Walker Art Center) serve as important spaces for exchange. Beyond museums that reach a wider audience, there are more and more smaller museums and galleries that focus on new media art (such as the Berlin- based DAM ‚Äì Digital Art Museum). Additionally, archives in which are exhibited artifacts situated at the intersection of the histories of media, art, and technology are important resources, including collections such as that of Werner Nekes or those cabinets of wonder and curiosity incorporated in art history museums. Even given this increase in festivals, however, a variety of significant research initiatives have been discontinued. These include the Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Media.Art.Research, the Daniel Langlois Foundation for Art, Science and Technology,http://www.fondation- langlois.org/html/e/ and Media Art Net. This difficulty in establishing sustainable funding structures as well as support for access to shared data for the scientific research of new media art was made public and addressed by the Liverpool Declaration. Scholars and artists based at institutions all over the globe signed the declaration in a call to develop systematic strategies to fulfill the task that digital culture and its research demands in the 21st Century.Signatories are, among others, Sean CUBITT, Goldsmith; Oliver GRAU, Danube U; Ross HARLEY, UNSW Sydney; Christiane PAUL, New School, New York; Diana DOMINGUES, Universidade de Bras√≠lia; Horst BREDEKAMP, Humboldt- University Berlin; Barbara Maria STAFFORD, Georgia Tech; Frieder NAKE, University of Bremen; Peter WEIBEL, ZKM; Roy ASCOTT, University of Plymouth, Sir Nicholas SEROTA, Tate; Martin WARNKE, Leuphana University, Mike STUBBS, FACT Liverpool; Benjamin WEIL, LABORAL; Andreas BROECKMANN, Leuphana Arts Program; Jeffrey SHAW, City University Hong Kong; Eduardo KAC, Chicago Arts Institute; Christa SOMMERER, University of Art Linz; Alex ADRIAANSENS, Institute for the Unstable Media, Lanfranco ACETI, Sabanci U; Howard BESSER, NYU‚Äôs Tisch School of the Arts, Ianina PRUDENKO, National Univ.

Already in the late 1990s it became clear, that media art research is spread over many disciplines and the need became urgent to give it common ground: Therefore, at Humboldt University Berlin Oliver Grau in Cooperation with Roger Malina, Leonardo and Sara Diamond, Banff Center developed the international Conference Series on the Histories of MediaArt, Science and Technology, which was started in 2005 through a collective process, involving more than 10 disciplines related to media art. The world conference series attempts to foster the exchange between these different disciplines and their various actors. To date, the conference took place six times with Re-fresh (Banff 2005), Re-place (Berlin 2007), Re- live (Melbourne 2009), Re-wire (Liverpool 2011), Re-new (Riga 2013), Re-create (Montreal 2015), upcoming Vienna/Krems ad Donau (2017). Documentation of the meanwhile more than 2000 papers and applications can be found on MediaArtHistory.org  Focus of research  Several scholars in the field of media art history claim that there is still a considerable lack of knowledge regarding the origins of visual and audio-visual media.cf. Grau, Oliver. Introduction. In MediaArtHistories, edited by Oliver Grau, 1-14. Cambridge: MIT Press, 2005. Consequently, it is the objective of media art histories to expand the historically informed knowledge of current media cultures with its developments and detours ‚Äì the field is driven by the idea of a ‚Äòdeep time of the media‚Äô (S. Zielinski). Hence, scholars stress that the technological advances in current media cultures are best understood on the backdrop of an extensive media and art history. Contributions to this field are widespread and include, among others, researchers who have disciplinary focuses such as the history of science (Lorraine Daston, Timothy Lenoir), art history and image science (Oliver Grau, Barbara Stafford, Dieter Daniels, Slavko Kacunko, Edward A. Shanken, Gunalan Nadarajan, Linda Henderson, Andreas Broeckmann, Jonathan Crary, Horst Bredekamp, Peter Weibel, Hans Belting), media studies and media archaeology (Friedrich Kittler, Erkki Huhtamo, Jussi Parikka, Wolfgang Ernst, Siegfried Zielinski, Stephan Oettermann, Lev Manovich), sound studies (Douglas Kahn), film studies (Sean Cubitt, Ryszard Kluszczy≈Ñski), as well as computer science (Frieder Nake).

It sets out a history of moral philosophy and presents new ideas in ethics, which have been described as quasi-utilitarianism.  Summary  How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time has forty chapters, which are grouped into six parts.  Part I. The Problem: We Need to Make Decisions, But We Don't Know How (Chapters 1‚Äì6)  For ethical advice to be credible, the book says it cannot be perceived as arbitrary. The book cites The Dice Man ‚Äì a man who makes choices based on dice rolls ‚Äì as an example of advice- following which is arbitrary and so cannot be regarded as ethical. Chapter three argues intuitions about what we should do can be more useful, but are undermined because our multiple intuitions often lead to contradictory advice (e.g. ‚Äòhelp a stranger‚Äô or ‚Äòput family first‚Äô?). Philosophers have sought to eliminate these contradictions by locating right and wrong in a single part of the decision-making process: for example, in the actions we take (e.g. Kant), in our character (e.g. Aristotle, virtue ethics) or in the consequences of our actions (e.g. Utilitarianism). Chapter four explains how ‚Äòdo whatever is best‚Äô (utilitarianism) still dominates modern philosophical and economic thinking. Chapter five cites seven faults with utilitarianism. These are that it can be self-defeating; that it considers only future events and ignores the past; that it places decision-making authority in questionable hands; that it doesn‚Äôt discriminate fairly between people; that it sacrifices individual concerns to the group interest; that it down-grades promises, fairness and truth-telling; and that it doesn‚Äôt offer any clear rules.How to Make Good Decisions... a 62 point summary (pdf) The chapter also argues that the main argument for utilitarianism is invalid, and ‚Äòempty‚Äô.http://leehopkins.com/counselling/2015/11/12/ethics-condundrum-1/  Part II. The Proof: Finding the Basics of Right and Wrong (Chapters 7‚Äì14)  Part II starts with a secular revision of Pascal‚Äôs Wager, arguing ‚ÄúWhat does it hurt to pursue value and virtue? If there is value, then we have everything to gain, but if there is none, then we haven‚Äôt lost anything.‚Äù Thus, it rationally makes sense for us to pursue something of value. It says that ‚Äúpeople ultimately derive their choices from what they want to do and what other people want to do‚Äù Did Angela do Good or Bad? Peter Greenwell, 2015 It then presents four different arguments for deriving a basic principle from which right and wrong can be developed. These are an adaptation of utilitarianism; an adaptation of John Rawls' theory; an argument from evolutionary theory;Moral Laws of the Jungle, Philosophy Now magazine, 2014 and a 'Sherlock Holmes' approach. All four arguments converge on empathy, obligation and the ‚ÄòHelp Principle‚Äô, which the book argues are kernels of a viable ethical system. According to Audrey Tang, King's philosophy advocates: \\"If spending one unit of your effort could help another person by two units, he detailed in his book, you should help.\\"Open Source Enlightenment, Audrey Tang, 2015  Part III. The Principle: Refining the Help Principle (Chapters 15‚Äì22)  Part III defines the Help Principle more carefully, with a section on autonomy,International Journal of Bio-Ethics, 2014 and a critique of the golden rule. It results in an approach to ethics which combines deontology, consequentialism and virtue ethics. This has been described as quasi- utilitarianism.D‚ÄôSouza, J. F. and Adams, C. K. (2016). \\"On Measuring the Moral Value of Action\\". Frontiers of Philosophy in China. 11(1), pp. 122‚Äì136.  Part IV. The Program: Extending the Principles to Other Problems (Chapters 23‚Äì31)  Part IV attempts to distinguish white lies from bad lies.http://www.christopherxjjensen.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/gendels- ross-research-paper.pdf Contradicting Aristotle, who believed no general rule on lying was possible, 'For he who advocates lying can never be believed or trusted,' and St Augustine, who believed all lies were sinful, the book presents a definition of good lies, and argues why it is credible and superior. The Conundrum of Illicit Financial Flows, Teshome Abebe, November 14, 2014 Chapters 28 and 29 reconcile individual human rights with group interests. Both individual justice and social justice feature.  Part V. Practical Advice: For Real People in the Modern World (Chapters 32‚Äì38)  Part V deals with situations when information is not certain, and other real world problems which are absent from much academic philosophy. These problems make effective altruism impractical and rare.Food for the Mind, by Blake Hall, May 1, 2010 Chapter 34 argues that the notion of integrity can only make sense in ethics if it is applied to the consequences people allow to happen rather than to people themselves.  Part VI. The Prognosis: How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time (Chapters 39‚Äì40)  Part VI claims a hybrid system can be internally-consistent and address several problems of the main schools of ethics. Chapter 40 concludes it is impossible to make good decisions all the time because we can never know enough about the world, and the consequences of our actions. Hence, ethics can never emulate the scientific revolution by offering a simple set of rules for every situation, similar to those derived by Newton. This is because Newton‚Äôs own rules can never be applied perfectly, because we can never know how the world really is.  About the book  The book has a satirical title, and was published on 1 December 2008. It became a bestseller within the category of philosophy books in 2013.Philosophy Books, 2013 The book answers the Frege‚ÄìGeach Problem, the Fact‚ÄìValue Gap, and the Open Question Argument,'Moral Philosophy for Elves' (University of Cambridge, United Kingdom) although the given answers have been challenged. The book has been used to reconcile utilitarian and rules-based ethics. Humanist psychologists have used the book to explain why only proven phenomena is needed to prove why morality exists, and what the parameters of morality should be. Theists have commented on the way the book grounds ethics without recourse to religion. The book is used to apply ethical considerations to finance and accounting, and has been used to justify certain bad actions as a ‚Äònecessary evil‚Äô.

Its production is the highest in the world (in excess of 20 percent of world production) since 1982 until recently overtaken by India. Twenty-four of the 35 provinces of China grow cotton with nearly 300 million people involved in its production. It is the main input for textile industry of the country with cotton textiles now accounting for 80% use vis-a-vis 95% in the 1950s. The cotton textile industry employs over 10 million people. Its production in 2012‚Äì13 was 7.6 million tons but in 2013‚Äì14 it dropped to 7 million tons. Historically, its introduction in China is considered a 'southernization', crop which originated from southern Asia (India) during the \\"proto-globalization\\" period. History Cotton, which is called mian () or mumian () in Chinese was first reported from an area now known as Yunnan, some time around 200 BC. Lao-ai tribe in the southwest border region is reported to have produced quality cotton cloth around 25‚Äì220 CE. In the Tarim Basin archaeological finds of cotton cloth on mummies dated around 1,000 BC have also been reported. In the early Han dynasty period in Siachen in Western China, around 100 BC, quality cotton cloth has been noted. From all these documented and archaeological evidences, a historian has called the introduction of cotton in the country as \\"southernization\\" during which period the cotton species introduced were Gossypium herbaceum (an Afro-Asian species) and Gossypium arboreum and Gossypium hardense from India; the latter species were grown in Guangdong and Fujian provinces during the ninth century AD but were blocked for introduction into Sichuan province due to a strong silk lobby. However, adoption of scientific methods of cultivation came into practice only from 1949. Area under cotton Cotton cultivation in Yangxin County The cotton sown area accounts for about 30 percent of the total sown area of all the various cash crops. The major regions, according where cotton is a prime crop are the Xinjiang Autonomous Region, the Yangtze River Basin (including provinces of Jiangxi and Hubei), and the Huang-Huai Region (mainly in provinces of Hebei, Henan, and Shandong). However, according to agroclimatic regions they are under three zones of the northwest inland cotton region, the Yellow River valley region and the Yangtze River valley region, which together account for 99.5% area under cotton with a total yield of 99.7%. The area planted in 2012 was 5.3 million hectares and the average lint yield was per ha. Varieties of cotton Both Bt cotton and non Bt cotton varieties are used in China. Bt cotton is a major genetically modified crop, which is adopted for commercial production. This was introduced after several field trials in cotton growing provinces and found to be economically profitable in terms of not only production but also revenue. It was introduced in 2002 in about 45% of country‚Äôs total area under cotton as it also proved to have better pest resistance. The Hybrid (F1) Bt cotton, developed after crossing with a non-Bt line, has found favour in southern China because of higher yield due to better methods of farming such as seedling transplantation and planting at lower population density. Now Bollgard Bt cotton is adopted in 55% of cropped area while 45% area is planted with China‚Äôs own Bt cotton. Production According to the FAO statistics for 2012, cotton production was 6.84 million tonnes with cotton seed production of 13.68 million tonnes. The crops grown are under intensive cotton cultivation practices, typically with Chinese adaptations covering special seedling transplanting (since 1950's), plastic mulching since 1979, plant training and double cropping of the cotton‚Äìwheat (Triticum aestivum) system (from 1980s to 1990s). Another practice introduced extensively since 1980 is the adoption of high-yielding cultivation pattern known as \\"short-dense-early\\" in the northwestern inland areas which is stated to have contributed to China achieving the status of world number one in cotton production.

Above this temperature the material is an electrical insulator. PTC rubberUS patent 8,367,986 is a silicone rubber which conducts electricity with a resistivity that increases exponentially with increasing temperature for all temperatures up to a temperature where the resistivity grows to infinity. Above this temperature the PTC rubber is an electrical insulator. PTC rubber is made from polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) loaded with carbon nanoparticles. PTC stands for Positive temperature coefficient. Properties If the electric field strength inside the material is large enough (typically larger than 30 V/mm), the carbon nanoparticles trigger a quantum mechanical tunneling effect current to flow through the material. The contribution from a large number of small tunneling effect currents can add up to macroscopic currents in the range of amperes. The quantum mechanical tunneling effect inside the material is highly temperature dependent. The current decreases exponentially with increasing temperature. This means that the resistivity of the material grows exponentially with increasing temperature. At a specific temperature the quantum mechanical tunneling effect current ceases. At temperatures higher than this the PTC rubber is an electrical insulator and no electrical current can flow through it. This temperature can be adjusted between 32 and 176 F (0 and 80 C) during the production of the PTC rubber. Hence, PTC rubber is a PTC material with very strong PTC characteristics. In fact, PTC rubber has the strongest PTC effect of all known materials, and over a wide temperature range. It has PTC properties for all temperatures. Applications The PTC rubber can be rolled into thin sheets and laminated with copper. The copper is in turn connected to a voltage to provide the electrical field inside the material necessary to trigger the tunneling effect. The sheets can be formed into any shape and size. PTC rubber sheets can be used as thin flexible PTC heaters. These heaters will provide high power when they are cold and rapidly heat up themselves to a constant temperature and remain there virtually unaffected by changes in the ambient conditions. They can be powered with any voltage between 5 and 230 V, AC or DC. The PTC rubber material is a self-regulating heater. It produces the same amount of heat in each point of the heater as is conducted and radiated away from the heater to the object it is attached to, and its surroundings. It is in constant thermal equilibrium with the environment, point by point. A measure of the power produced by the heater is actually a measurement of the heat transfer between the heater and the object. Hence, it can be used as a heat transfer sensor.

The book explains this history with sections on Kosovo's security and the rule of law; inter-ethnic relations; political developments; hearts, minds and culture; and economy. It draws on Kai Eide's Report of 2005, which criticized the international community's performance in Kosovo, and was approved unanimously by the United Nations Security Council. The book has 226 citations in other published works, and features in university reading lists on politics, conflict studies and international relations.Google Scholar, accessed 2017-02-08 The book concludes that: ‚ÄúThe international community was very successful where there was a strong and unified international will to tackle a straightforward physical task, such as the humanitarian crisis of 1999‚Ä¶ Where the international protectorate almost completely failed was in changing the way people thought and behaved... After six years of unprecedented international support, Kosovo remained a place where the strong bullied the weak and where there remained an extraordinary lack of public spirit. This is less than Western democracies hoped for when they intervened to stop barbarities in 1999, and much less than most of the thousands of foreigners and Kosovans believed they were working towards between 1999 and 2005.‚Äù It attributes this poor performance to six mistakes made by the international community: * Failure to understand Kosovo's history and culture; * Deep reluctance to assert control over the means by which public attitudes were shaped; * Incoherence in the mandate for the international mission, UNSCR 1244; * Flaws in the way the international civilian organizations tasked with governing Kosovo were structured; * Failures of political will, which meant lingering problems, such inadequate enforcement of the law, were allowed to fester; and * Failures of time and patience, ‚Äòa lack of political stamina‚Ä¶ the classic misfit of short-term solutions to long-term problems.‚Äô; The book concludes with ten lessons for future interventions.

Early life and training Jan Petrus Bosman was born in Kuilsrivier, a town in the Western Cape Province located on the Kuils River, in which there are many pools, or . His parents were Afrikaners, but young Petrus was raised to be fluent in English as well as Afrikaans.Marina Grut, \\"Bosman, Petrus,\\" in The History of Ballet in South Africa (Cape Town: Human & Rousseau, 1981), p. 357. His family was related to Herman Charles Bosman (1905‚Äì1951), widely admired as a journalist, poet, and author. Also of Afrikaner stock, he was celebrated as a short-story writer in English. Like his famous relative, Petrus Bosman easily entered the English-speaking cultural community of Cape Town, only a few kilometres west of his hometown. As a teenager, he enrolled in classes at the University of Cape Town Ballet School, where he was trained by Dulcie Howes and Cecily Robinson.Richard Glasstone, Dulcie Howes: Pioneer of Ballet in South Africa (Cape Town: Human & Rousseau, 1996), p. 45. In 1949, when he was 21, he went to London and continued his studies with Anna Northcote (also known as Anna Severskaya) at her studio on West Street. There she passed on to him the classical technique she had learned from her own teachers: Margaret Craske, Nikolai Legat, and Olga Preobrajenska. Performing career In 1951, at age 23, Bosman joined Festival Ballet, founded the previous year by Alicia Markova and Anton Dolin to celebrate the nationwide Festival of Britain, held during the summer of 1951. With this young, ambitious company (later called London Festival Ballet, then English National Ballet), he danced in cities all over England during the next eight years, appearing in many featured roles in the repertory and scoring a particular success as the Golden Slave in an elaborate production of Michel Fokine's Scheherazade. Remarkably, he also danced all three principal male roles in Fokine's Petrushka: the title role, the Moor, and the Charlatan, the old magician who presents the puppet show that tells of Petrushka's unrequited love for the Ballerina. In 1959, Bosman left London Festival Ballet to join the Royal Ballet as a soloist, the first dancer to do so without having attended the prestigious Royal Ballet School. At the beginning of his eighteen years with the company, he advanced rapidly through the ranks to attain the status of principal dancer. He was noted for his classical roles in Giselle, The Sleeping Beauty, and The Nutcracker as well as for such romantic roles as the Poet in Les Sylphides. In Frederick Ashton's lighthearted Les Rendezvous, he partnered Merle Park in choreography that was a challenge for them both; in Fokine's The Firebird, he played the sorcerer Koschei the Immortal who guards his soul in a magic egg; and in John Cranko's The Lady and the Fool, he played Moondog, the foolish clown with whom The Lady falls in love. He also excelled in travesty character roles, playing Carabosse in The Sleeping Beauty, Widow Simone in La Fille Mal Gard√©e, and an Ugly Sister in Cinderella.Zo√´ Anderson, The Royal Ballet: 75 Years (London: Faber & Faber, 2011), passim. During his years in London, Bosman organised dancers for performances at the Chichester and Aldeburgh festivals and produced a series of nine charity galas sponsored by members of the royal family. Working closely with Princess Margaret, he staged glittering performances featuring such stars of the ballet stage as Margot Fonteyn, Rudolf Nureyev, Merle Park, Antoinette Sibley, Anthony Dowell, Johaar Mosaval, himself, and other notables of the dance world. For his contributions to British charities, Bosman was invited to be among the guests honoured by Queen Elizabeth II at a luncheon at Buckingham Palace.West, \\"Petrus Bosman,\\" obituary, The Stage (2008). Bosman went back to southern Africa in a professional capacity at least four times during his tenure with the Royal Ballet. In 1955, he returned to Cape Town to stage, produce, and star in Petrushka for the University of Cape Town Ballet;Glasstone, Dulcie Howes (1996), p. 94. in 1969, he appeared as guest artist with PACT Ballet in Johannesburg; and in 1970, he toured Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) in a series of performances with Merle Park, a native of Salisbury. In 1973, he once again returned to Cape Town to stage Petrushka for CAPAB Ballet. His appearance in the title role was his farewell performance as a dancer.Marina Grut and Claude Conyers, \\"CAPAB Ballet,\\" in International Encyclopedia of Dance, edited by Selma Jeanne Cohen and others (New York: Oxford University Press, 1998), vol. 2, p. 57. Later life When he retired as a performer, Bosman taught at Rosella Hightower's √âcole Superieure de Danse de Cannes, on the French Riviera. While there, he formed a company based on the facilities at the school, the Jeune Ballet de France, C√¥te d'Azur, and completed foreign tours with it to Australia, Singapore, China, Korea, and Switzerland. He then moved to the United States, in 1977, to join the artistic staff of the Maryland Ballet in Baltimore. When that company disbanded after a disastrous fire, he served as director of public relations for the Cultural Arts Program in the city. As a freelance choreographer and r√©p√©titeur, Bosman mounted ballets from the Royal Ballet repertory as well as his own original works for a number of American companies. His productions of Copp√©lia, Swan Lake, Les Patineurs, and Les Rendezvous were performed by the Lake Charles Civic Ballet Company, the Pittsburgh Ballet, the Pennsylvania Ballet, Virginia Ballet Theater, and the Milwaukee Ballet, among others.West, \\"Petrus Bosman,\\" obituary, The Stage (2008). Perhaps Bosman's greatest contribution to the American dance world was as a teacher. He served as ballet master for Ballet West in Salt Lake City, Utah, and taught as guest teacher in many other schools and companies across the country. Wherever he went, he was a popular teacher and a welcome guest, known for his merry disposition, taste for fine food and drink, wicked sense of humor, and immaculate attire‚Äîexcept in class, where he always wore sweat pants. His last staff positions were as artistic director of the Virginia School of the Arts, in Lynchburg, and as adjunct professor of dance at nearby Sweet Briar College. During his seventeen years in Lynchburg, his artistic sensibilities and strong pedagogic abilities touched the lives of many in the local community. Bosman remained at the Virginia School of the Arts until his retirement at the end of 2006, when he was honoured with the title of artistic director emeritus. While working as a guest teacher at the Jordan Academy of Dance at Butler University in Indianapolis, Indiana, he suffered a heart attack and died. He was 80 years old.West, \\"Petrus Bosman,\\" obituary, The Stage (2008).

Shiva is worshipped as Ona Kantheeswarar and his consort Parvathi as Kamakshi. Ona Kantheeswarar is revered in the 7th century Tamil Saiva canonical work, the Tevaram, written by Tamil saint poets known as the nayanars and classified as Paadal Petra Sthalam, the 275 temples reverred in the canon. The temple has a small three-tiered rajagopuram, the entrance tower and all the shrines are located in an elevated structure. The temple has two daily rituals at various times from 5:30 a.m. to 8 p.m., and three yearly festivals on its calendar, namely the MargazhiTiruvathirai during the Tamil month of Margazhi (December - January) and Aipassi full moon day Aippassi (October - November) being the most prominent. The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu. Etymology and legend As per Hindu legend, the temple was believed to have been built by two asuras (demons) named Onan and Kanthan. The asuras got a lingam (an iconic representation of Shiva) from a forest in the region and became ardent devotees. On account of their devotion, they got all the desired boons. There was a third asura, Jalandeeswaran, who joined the two, and became an ardent devotee of Shiva. The three shrines in the temple, each dedicated to Onakantheeswarar, Salantheeswarar and Jalandeeswarar are believed to be the respective shrines built by the demons. Sundarar, a 7th-century Tamil Saivite poet, venerated Ona Kantheeswarar in one verse in Tevaram, compiled as the Seventh Tirumurai. As the temple is revered in Tevaram, it is classified as Paadal Petra Sthalam, one of the 275 temples that find mention in the Saiva canon. It is believed that he got back one of his eyes which he lost on account of not keeping his word in the Ekambanathar Temple. To test his devotion, Shiva moved toward a tamarind tree and Sundarar followed his footsteps and sung praises of Shiva. His devotion was admired and Shiva turned the tamarind leaves to golden leaves and poured on him from the skies. Architecture The temple is located south-west of Ekambareswarar Temple in Kanchipuram in a locality called Panjupettai. Ona Kantheeswarar temple complex has a single prakarams (outer courtyard) covering an area of and a small three-tiered rajagopuram (gateway tower) facing East. The central shrine faces east and holds the two image of Ona Kantheeswarar (Shiva) in the form of lingam made of granite and is believed to be a swayambumoorthy (self manifested). There are two other shrines of Shiva namely Salantheeswarar and Jalandeeswarar. As in other temples in Kanchipuram, there is no separate shrine of Parvathi as it is believed that Kamakshi of Kanchipuram is the common Parvathi shrine for all Shiva temples. There is a separate shrine for Vinayagar called Vaiyurunthi Pillayar. The granite images of Nandi (the bull and vehicle of Shiva), a tall flag staff and a Balipeeta, the place of offering, axial to the sanctum. As in other Shiva temples of Tamil Nadu, the first precinct or the walls around the sanctum of Ona Kantheeswarar has images of Dakshinamurthy (Shiva as the Teacher), Durga (warrior-goddess) and Chandikeswarar (a saint and devotee of Shiva). The temple precinct is surrounded by granite walls. Worship and religious practices The temple priests perform the puja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. The temple rituals are performed two times a day; Kalasanthi at 8:00 a.m. and Sayarakshai at 6:30 p.m. Each ritual comprises four steps: abhisheka (sacred bath), alangaram (decoration), naivethanam (food offering) and deepa aradanai (waving of lamps) for Ona Kantheeswarar. There are weekly rituals like ' (Monday) and ' (Friday), fortnightly rituals like pradosham and monthly festivals like amavasai (new moon day), kiruthigai, pournami (full moon day) and sathurthi. The Margazhi Tiruvathirai during the Tamil month of Margazhi (December - January) and Aipassi full moon day during Aippassi (October - November) are the two festivals celebrated in the temple.

It is a rhizomatous perennial, from the Savoy Alps in southern France and recently in Italy. It has green, deeply ribbed, sickle shaped leaves, a slender stem with a branch (from the middle), 1‚Äì3 scented flowers that are violet or purple, with a white or pale blue beard. It is rarely cultivated as an ornamental plant in temperate regions, due to its rarity in the wild. It was once thought to be a form of Iris aphylla, before cell (chromosome) analysis determined it to be a separate species. Description It is similar in form to Iris aphylla, but has various differences including, stem branching, spathes, the falls, styles crests and seeds.British Iris Society (1997) It has a thick, compact rhizome, that has several branching buds. Like other bearded irises, it grows partially buried, horizontally across the ground. It has green, falcate (sickle-shaped) leaves, that are very heavily ribbed, so much so that they appear corrugated or pleated. They can grow up to between long, and between 2.0 and 2.4 cm wide. They are shorter than Iris aphylla. It has a slender stem or peduncle, that can grow up to between tall. Compared to Iris aphylla, it branches (or pedicels) from the middle of the stem, (on Iris aphylla, it branches close to the base or rhizome,) it very rarely has 2 branches. The stem has green, inflated, spathe (leaf of the flower bud), They are between long. They also remain green, after the plant has flowered, unlike some others which turn papery. The large spathe leaf, partially, encases the perianth tube. If the plant does not have a branch, it only has 1 spathe. The stem (and the branch) can hold between 1 and 3 flowers, but normally 2 flowers, blooming between April to May. The fragrant flowers, come in shades of violet, or purple. Like other irises, it has 2 pairs of petals, 3 large sepals (outer petals), known as the 'falls' and 3 inner, smaller petals (or tepals), known as the 'standards'. The falls are obovate to cuneate (wedge shaped), and long, and 2.2‚Äì3 cm wide. They have lots of dark veining, and in the centre, there is a row of short hairs, a 'beard', which are white or pale blue. Near to the stem, the beard has a yellow or orange tip. The standards are oblong shaped, and a similar length to the falls, long, and 2.2‚Äì3 cm wide. It has a 6 grooved and rounded ovary, which is 1.2‚Äì1.4 cm long and 0.5‚Äì0.6 cm wide. It has a perianth tube is 1.7‚Äì2 cm long, the style branch is normally pale violet with darker keels (connecting points) and 1‚Äì1.6 cm long. It also has a pale violet filament, which is 1.2‚Äì1.7 cm long and a 1‚Äì1.2 cm long anther. After the iris has flowered, in mid June, it produces an oblong shaped seed capsule, which is visibly grooved. Inside the capsule, are pyriform (pear shaped), reddish brown and wrinkled seeds. The seeds are dispersed by animals or grow up near to the parent plants. Biochemistry In 1956, a karyotype analysis was carried out on 40 species of Iris, belonging to the subgenera Eupogoniris and Pogoniris. It found that 24-chromosome tall bearded species could e divided into 3 karyotypes of Iris pallida. Iris kashmiriana has 2 pairs of median-constricted marker chromosomes, Iris illyrica, Iris cengialti, and Iris imbricata, lastly Iris variegata, Iris reginae (now classified as a synonym of Iris variegata), and Iris perrieri all have no median-constricted chromosomes. In 2008, a genetic and morphological study was carried out on Iris aphylla populations in Italy. Some populations (in Piemonte) were re-classified as Iris perrieri and plants labelled as Iris benacensis were not either Iris perrieri or Iris aphylla. In 2012, a study was carried out on the flora of Italy, using Ellenberg's Indicator values (relating to moisture, light, climate and salinity) for Iris benacensis and Iris perrieri. As most irises are diploid, having two sets of chromosomes, this can be used to identify hybrids and classification of groupings. It is a diploid, and has a chromosome count of 2n=24, counted in 1956, by Mitra. The karyotype was described as being more similar to Iris variegata than to Iris aphylla. Taxonomy It has the common name of 'Perrieri iris', or 'Perrier iris'. The Latin specific epithet perrieri refers to Eug√®ne Pierre Perrier de la B√¢thie, (1825‚Äì1916), Baron E. Perrier de la Bathie, who ran a speciality plant nursery at the nearby town of Albertville. It was found in 1890 by Baron E. Perrier and Dr Chabert (his friend), on Mount Dent d'Arcluz in the Bauges Mountains, but thought to be a form of Iris aphylla (which was at time called Iris bohemia, later classified as a synonym of Iris aphylla). In June 1894, in the 'Bulletin de l'Herbier Boissier' (Bull. Herb. Bois.), Vol.2 issue 11 on page436, Baron Perrier and Andre Songeon (1826‚Äì1905), published the iris as Iris bohemia. The plant was then published as a separate species, and described by P Fournier based on an earlier description by Simonet as Iris perrieri in Les Quartre Flore de la France, Vol.191 in 1935. In 1985, Nigel Service published a description and history in The Iris Year Book, he then published it in The Plantsman Vol.2, on page 91 in 2003. As it was originally thought to be a form of Iris aphylla, it has often been classed as a synonym of I. aphylla, Although it has a different chromosome morphology, Dr. L. F. Randolph (in 1959), stated that the two species were not related. It was verified by United States Department of Agriculture and the Agricultural Research Service on 4 April 2003, and updated on 3 December 2004. It is an accepted name, by The Plant List, but listed with no synonyms and Simonet ex N.Service as the authors. It is listed in the Encyclopedia of Life, with Simonet ex N.Service as the authors. It is listed in the Catalogue of Life, with Simonet ex N.Service as the authors. It is a tentatively accepted name by the RHS. Distribution and habitat It is native to Europe. Range It is found in France, within the department of Savoie, (or Savoy), near the town of Saint-Pierre-d'Albigny,Becherer Thommen and on Mount Dent d'Arclusaz, in the Bauges Mountains. It is found in the Alps. In 2011, it was also found in Italy, in the Maritime Alps, in the Province of Cuneo, in Gesso Valley, near to the town of Valdieri. Habitat It grows on the steep mountain sides, on rocky slopes, in reddish soils, made of limestone. It can be found with other alpine species such as Aster alpinus, Globularia cordifolia and Helianthemum nummularium. They can be found at an altitude of above sea level. Conservation It is a very rare plant, with only 2‚Äì3 populations found on the mountains of Savoy, France and Piedmont, Italy. The populations are protected, (from collection and other disturbances), and it is listed in the 'Conservatoire d'espaces naturels de Savoie' (the Conservatory of Savoy Natural Heritage)'s Red Book National Volume I. Cultivation It is hardy (in Europe), but may not grow well in areas with wet summers. It prefers to grow in well-drained soils, and in a sunny situation. It is very rarely found in specialised iris nurseries, and often called Iris aphylla. It is a slow growing and takes many years for the plant to create a colony. Aphid Dysaphis tulipae can be found on the plant.R. L. Blackman, Victor F. Eastop A herbarium specimen can be found at the Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle in Paris. It can also be found growing in Rea Botanical Garden Piedmont, in Italy, and in the alpine botanic garden of La Jaysinia in Samo√´ns, Haute Savoie, France. Propagation Irises can generally be propagated by division, or by seed growing. Hybrids and cultivars It is thought that the iris could be used in hybridizing, giving better branching, small irises. Toxicity Like many other irises, most parts of the plant are poisonous (rhizome and leaves), and if mistakenly ingested can cause stomach pains and vomiting. Also, handling the plant may cause skin irritation or an allergic reaction.David G Spoerke and Susan C. Smolinske ReferencesSources * Mathew, B. 1981. The Iris. 193‚Äì194.

It includes a number of well-known plants including broom, lupine (lupin), gorse and laburnum. The tribe's greatest diversity is in the Mediterranean, and most genera are native to Europe, Africa, the Canary Islands, India and southwest Asia. However, the largest genus, Lupinus, is most diverse in North and South America. Anarthrophytum and Sellocharis are also South American and Argyrolobium ranges into India. Description The Genisteae arose 32.3 ¬± 2.9 million years ago (in the Oligocene). The members of this tribe consistently form a monophyletic clade in molecular phylogenetic analyses. The tribe does not currently have a node-based definition, but several morphological synapomorphies have been identified: > ‚Ä¶ bilabiate calyces with a bifid upper lip and a trifid lower lip, ‚Ä¶ the > lack of an aril, or the presence of an aril but on the short side of the > seed, and stamen filaments fused in a closed tube with markedly dimorphic > anthers ‚Ä¶ and presence of Œ±-pyridone alkaloids. Most (and possibly all) genera in the tribe produce 5-O-methylgenistein. Many genera also accumulate quinolizidine alkaloids, ammodendrine-type dipiperidine alkaloids, and macrocyclic pyrrolizidine alkaloids. Name Old English ' is from a common West Germanic ' (Old High German ', \\"bramble\\"), from a Germanic stem ' from Proto-Indo-European *bh(e)rem- \\"to project; a point\\", with an original sense of \\"thorny shrub\\" or similar. Use of the branches of these plants for sweeping gave rise to the term broom for sweeping tools in the 15th century, gradually replacing Old English ' (which survives as dialectal or archaic besom). Cultivation Cytisus scoparius, Common Broom. 1. Two-lipped calyx. 2. Broadly ovate vexillum or standard. 3. One of the alae or wings of the corolla. 4. Carina or keel. 5. Monadelphous stamens. 6. Hairy ovary with the long style, thickened upwards, and spirally curved. 7. Legume or pod. Brooms tolerate (and often thrive best in) poor soils and growing conditions. In cultivation they need little care, though they need good drainage and perform poorly on wet soils. They are widely used as ornamental landscape plants and also for wasteland reclamation (e.g. mine tailings) and sand dune stabilising. Tagasaste (Chamaecytisus proliferus), a Canary Islands native, is widely grown as sheep fodder. Species of broom popular in horticulture are purple broom (Chamaecytisus purpureus; purple flowers), Atlas broom (or Moroccan broom) (Argyrocytisus battandieri, with silvery foliage), dwarf broom (Cytisus procumbens), Provence broom (Cytisus purgans) and Spanish broom (Spartium junceum). Many of the most popular brooms in gardens are hybrids, notably Kew broom (Cytisus √ókewensis, hybrid between C. ardoinii and C. multiflorus) and Warminster broom (Cytisus √ópraecox, hybrid between C. purgans and C. multiflorus). Invasive species On the east and west coasts of North America, common broom (Cytisus scoparius) was introduced as an ornamental plant (i.e.:California since the 1860s).http://www.invasive.org/gist/moredocs/cytsco01.pdf It is known in much of the pacific northwest as Scotch broom. It has become a naturalised invasive weed, and due to its aggressive seed dispersal broom removal has proved very difficult. Similarly, it is a major problem species in the cooler and wetter areas of southern Australia and New Zealand. Biological control for broom in New Zealand has been investigated since the mid-1980s. On the west coast of the United States, French broom (Genista monspessulana), Mediterranean broom (Genista linifolia) and Spanish broom (Spartium junceum) are also considered noxious invasives, as broom quickly crowds out native vegetation, and grow most prolifically in the least accessible areas. brooms in spring at Fondachelli-Fantina, Sicily Historical uses Broom (plant)The Plantagenet kings used common broom (known as ' in Latin) as an emblem and took their name from it. It was originally the emblem of Geoffrey of Anjou, father of Henry II of England. Wild broom is still common in dry habitats around Anjou, France. Charles V and his son Charles VI of France used the pod of the broom plant (broom-cod, or ') as an emblem for livery collars and badges. Genista tinctoria (dyer's broom, also known as dyer's greenweed or dyer's greenwood), provides a useful yellow dye and was grown commercially for this purpose in parts of Britain into the early 19th century. Woollen cloth, mordanted with alum, was dyed yellow with dyer's greenweed, then dipped into a vat of blue dye (woad or, later, indigo) to produce the once-famous \\"Kendal Green\\" (largely superseded by the brighter \\"Saxon Green\\" in the 1770s). Kendal green is a local common name for the plant. The flower buds and flowers of Cytisus scoparius have been used as a salad ingredient, raw or pickled, and were a popular ingredient for salmagundi or \\"grand sallet\\" during the 17th and 18th century. There are now concerns about the toxicity of broom, with potential effects on the heart and problems during pregnancy.

Hempfling first rose to prominence when he released the book Dancing with Horses in the early 1990s. In it he advocated horsemanship based on precise communication with the horse through body language rather than through more coercive methods. He currently lives and operates in Denmark. Early life Hempfling was born in Westphalia in Germany in 1957. He has stated that he spent much of his childhood living alone \\"in the woods\\", apparently estranged from his family. As a young adult, Hempfling completed studies in telecommunications technology in 1978. He then spent time variously as a teacher, freelance artist and theatrical director. He travelled extensively, and spent several years in Spain. While Eastern philosophies were fashionable in Europe at the time and drew many travellers to regions such as India, Hempfling was drawn more to the traditions of ancient and medieval Europe. Hempfling has occasionally referred to these old European traditions, particularly the concept of the knight as one who acts in harmony with, and achieves \\"complete being\\" or \\"oneness\\" with, their horse. Ebook available through horseconscious.com At age 26 Hempfling became a lecturer at the School of Art and Design in Dortmund. While at this stage he had not yet had any direct contact with horses, Hempfling became captivated by the prominent role of the horse in mythology. At age 29 he decided to seek out contact with real horses. To better understand horses Hempfling went through an intense period of \\"study, experimentation, learning and feeling\\" and began to develop his own training methods. He returned to Spain to observe feral horses in the Pyrenees Mountains and to study, if not employ, traditional training methods. His effectiveness as a horseman was noted by others and he soon began taking his own clinics and lessons. Within two years of his first contact with horses, Hempfling wrote Mit Pferden tanzen (\\"Dancing with Horses\\"), which described his approach to horse training and communication. Written in his native German, Dancing with Horses has been translated into several languages, including English, and became an international bestseller. Approach Most traditional and modern horse training methods utilise forms of operant conditioning, particularly negative reinforcement or \\"pressure/release\\" methods. While acknowledging their apparent effectiveness, Hempfling has explicitly rejected many conventional methods of horse training. He has distanced himself from the term \\"horse whisperer\\" which he associates with these techniques. Instead, Hempfling promotes the use of specific body language to establish a relationship between horse and human in which the horse recognises the human handler as the higher-ranking, dominant partner, but in which there is still trust in the handler. Hempfling claims that the handler can establish this relationship of dominance and trust through the use of subtle but powerful body signals and without the need for significant psychological or physical pressure on the horse. Hempfling developed these signals through his observations of high-ranking animals in feral horse populations. Hempfling incorporates this body language into all aspects of horse handling and training, including leading, lunging and riding. The handler's self-awareness, authenticity and mental and physical self-control are critical to the effectiveness of these techniques. Hempfling emphasises that seemingly trivial details, such as the handler's body posture, proximity to the horse or their minor haste or hesitation in acting or responding, can significantly affect the horse's response and its acceptance of the handler's rank. Hempfling also incorporates some elements of classical horsemanship in his training and his earlier books frequently mention classical principles. Overall, however, many of his techniques appear to bear little resemblance to conventional methods. The purported benefits of Hempfling's approach are that, once an effective relationship is established and maintained, the horse will be genuinely drawn to the handler, and the process of learning and training will become easier and more harmonious as the horse becomes a more willing and psychologically content partner. Horses can eventually be trained to ride with extremely subtle aids in this manner. Hempfling has been demonstrating these techniques for most of his career, often working with difficult, fearful or apparently aggressive horses and appearing to transform their behaviour within minutes. Many of these encounters have been filmed and included in movie documentaries and on YouTube. Hempfling has written several books in German documenting his evolving methods and outlook on horses, people and life. Several of these works have been translated into English. Character types Hempfling has emphasised the importance of tailoring training approaches to different horses according to their unique characteristics. He has claimed that a horse's temperament, intelligence, behaviour and potential health prospects can be partly predicted through its physical appearance, such as its facial structure and proportions and its conformation. His book What Horses Reveal categorises horses into 26 main character types, describing the physical characteristics that can be used to identify each character type, how this affects the horse's observable behaviour and personality traits, and how a person should best interact with and train the horse according to its type. Current activity Hempfling conducts horse-related clinics and seminars at his Akedah International school in Denmark, where he lives with his family. He also provides personal development and other consulting services through the school.

It is one of six organizations through which it is possible to sign up for service. There is a seventh organization, the Society for Social Equality and National Service, which serves the Arab population of Israel. History Aminadav was founded in 1990 as a means to place young women who have received army exemptions in volunteer positions throughout Israel. Instead of serving their country as soldiers, they serve as volunteers in welfare settings such as old age homes, schools and hospitals. The women commit to working full-time for between one and two years. Philosophy Aminadav represents and promotes the philosophy of religious Zionism, including improving social welfare institutions in Israel, community involvement in Israeli society, and unity. Organization There are 35 coordinators found in every major city or region in Israel. Each coordinator takes responsibility for about 40 volunteers throughout their one or two years of service. There is also a national coordinator serving the 35 regional coordinators. Services The regional coordinators offer the girls weekly group meetings as well as individualized counseling. Lectures and workshops cover religious issues or other issues. Aminadav also provides its volunteers with housing nearby to their volunteer jobs. Monthly stipends are also provided to cover meals and travel expenses. There are quarterly full-day seminars which offer professional enrichment workshops. Once a year the volunteers are taken on a weekend getaway as a way to say thank you for their service. Recruitment Representatives from Aminadav visit high schools throughout Israel to explain the benefits of national service and the options available for job placement. Partners and projects=Israel Elwyn and Mosaic In 2014 the Israeli National-Civic Service Administration asked Israel Elwyn (IE) to run a professional support program to provide services to other non-profits which in turn give support to volunteers with disabilities.

It is a densely foliaged, upright shrub with most of its parts covered with a silvery powder. Description Eremophila pterocarpa is a dense, rounded shrub growing to , sometimes ) in height. The leaves lack a stalk and are crowded together, linear to lance-shaped with a pointed end. They are usually long and wide. The leaves and stems are covered with powder- like short, matted hairs. The flowers are red to yellow, lack spots and are arranged singly in the leaf axils on a stalk which is long. There are 5 sepals which are narrow egg-shaped to triangular and of approximately equal lengths. The petals, which give the flowers their colour are long and joined in a tube with 5 lobes at the end. As with the leaves, the sepals and petals have a dusty covering of short, fine hairs. Flowering occurs between June and September and is followed by fruits which are flattened and dry with papery wings. Eremophila pterocarpa subsp. acicularis leaves and flowersEremophila pterocarpa fruit Taxonomy and naming The species was first formally described in 1904 by William Vincent Fitzgerald in the Journal of the Royal Society of Western Australia. The specific epithet pterocarpa is from the Ancient Greek œÄœÑŒµœÅœåŒΩ (pter√≥n) meaning ‚Äúwing\\" or \\"feather‚Äù and Œ∫Œ±œÅœÄœåœÇ (karp√≥s) meaning ‚Äúfruit\\" or \\"grain‚Äù referring to the winged fruits. Subspecies The following subspecies have been described by Robert Chinnock: *Eremophila pterocarpa subsp. pterocarpa which has leaves that are flat and wide; *Eremophila pterocarpa subsp. acicularis which has leaves that are needle-like or linear in shape, wide and have a channel along their lower surface.  Distribution and habitat Eremophila pterocarpa subsp. pterocarpa occurs in and between the Cape Range, Shark Bay and Meekatharra areas where it grows in sandy clay or soils derived from limestone, in flats or salty sites. Eremophila pterocarpa subsp. acicularis is found between Wiluna and the pastoral leases Neds Creek and Earaheedy, where it grows in more rocky, saline sites. Conservation Both subspecies of silver poverty bush are listed as \\"not threatened\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife. Use in horticulture The silvery-grey foliage and winged fruit are attractive features of this shrub as are the dusky pink to red flowers. It is a hardy plant and some in cultivation are more than 30 years old. It can be propagated from cuttings or by grafting onto Myoporum species and will grow in a wide range of soils, including saline, alkaline, or clay soils. In nature it is subject to long droughts and occasional flooding and this watering regime will encourage its flowering. It is also tolerant of frosts and of hard pruning when mature.

The episode premiered on Comedy Central on November 18, 2015. It parodies the abundance of online advertising, native advertising and clickbaits while humorously linking them to artificial intelligence, while continuing its season-long lampoon of political correctness. The story arc of this episode continues into the following episode \\"Truth and Advertising\\" and concludes with the episode \\"PC Principal Final Justice\\". Plot PC Principal is extremely angry over the word \\"retarded\\" being used in an op-ed column in the school newspaper and brings the paper's editor, Jimmy Valmer, to his office. Principal demands to review future editions of the newspaper before they are published to eliminate any offensive terms, but Jimmy refuses and accuses Principal of being unknowingly biased towards students with disabilities, a trait known as ableism. Principal states that the newspaper can no longer be distributed on campus, so Jimmy resorts to hand-delivering the paper to homes in South Park, including the fraternity house where Principal lives. Principal is further outraged when he sees that Jimmy's editorial in the newest edition refers to Principal's policy as \\"retarded\\". Stephen Stotch comments to his wife Linda how refreshing it is to be able to simply read the news, without having to deal with the online newspapers, which are filled with sponsored content, clickbait ads and hyperlinks, but she is in a near-catatonic state staring at her smartphone. Principal brings Jimmy in to talk with another disabled student, Nathan, who expresses distress at hearing the word \\"retarded\\", but privately Nathan admits to Jimmy that he believes all the changes happening in South Park are not a coincidence and that \\"a war is coming\\". At a Presidential debate, Hillary Clinton's physical appearance is attacked by Mr. Garrison and his running mate, Caitlyn Jenner. Garrison and Jenner are then met backstage by Principal Victoria. PC Principal hosts a party at his fraternity house for disabled people, including Jimmy, Timmy Burch, and others, but they are all marginalized there, as the younger fraternity members seem more interested in having sex with the women there, which they refer to as \\"crushing pussies\\". The next day, Jimmy prints an editorial that equates the politically correct term of \\"PC\\" to mean \\"Pussy Crushing\\". An advertising representative from GEICO offers Jimmy $26 million to allow their sponsored content in the school newspaper, but Jimmy refuses, as he has always declined any ads in the school newspaper. The man threatens to shoot Jimmy, but as he comments about the upcoming war, he is shot dead by Officer Barbrady, who then removes Jimmy from the scene. Randy and Sharon Marsh argue over the PC story in the newspaper, and Sharon finally demands that Randy stop going to their fraternity house, noting that Randy has changed and become more aggressive due to his association with the politically correct crowd. Jimmy and Barbrady meet with a group of men led by a mysterious stranger (seen in the previous episode \\"Naughty Ninjas\\"), who states that online ads have become more intelligent and even anticipate people's desires and needs to the point where they have developed a level of artificial intelligence. Jimmy is tested and shown to have an unusual ability to distinguish actual news stories from online ads, after which he is introduced to a schoolmate named Leslie. Jimmy and Leslie realize that the men they have been speaking with are former news reporters. Victoria, who has been speaking with Garrison and Jenner, reveals that she was never fired, but replaced. Principal removes Jimmy from the school newspaper and replaces him with Nathan. After speaking with Leslie, Jimmy identifies her as an advertisement, while Principal is extremely shocked as he views an online ad featuring himself and Leslie. Jenner drives herself, Victoria and Garrison back to South Park, running over multiple people in the process. Critical reception IGN's Max Nicholson gave the episode a 7.8 out of 10 and summarized that the episode \\"didn't really have the 'epic tie-in' feel it was going for within the larger PC storyline\\". Chris Longo from Den of Geek gave the episode 4 out of 5 stars and wrote in his review that the episode \\"hits all the right notes because Matt [Stone] and Trey [Parker] approach the dynamic between the readers, publishers, and advertisers in a way that‚Äôs painfully accurate\\". Writing for The A.V. Club, Dan Caffrey rated the episode an A‚àí and especially enjoyed the sci-fi references in the show, stating: \\"It also helps that everything‚Äôs played with a chilly sterility ‚Äî Jimmy‚Äôs conversation with Leslie feels reminiscent of Blade Runner, Ghost in the Shell, A.I., and any number of other films involving humans and the androids among them ‚Äî that feels like a true embrace of science fiction rather than a straight-up parody of it.\\" ReferencesExternal links *Episode 1908: \\"Sponsored Content\\" Press Release South Park Studios.

Little to nothing is known about Jones's personal background -- his name may have not even been Eddie Jones, but rather Jesse Marshall -- yet he is remembered for his 1960 recordings that appeared on an album, along with work by fellow musician Edward Hazelton. Jones's musicianship is regarded as a link between American blues and original elements of African music. Jones drifted to Los Angeles to work as a street performer in a poor district of the city known as Skid Row. Relying partially on the novelty of the unitar, which he crudely assembled with a piece of timber wood, one broom wire stretched across it, and a tin can mounted on the end, Jones gave no indication that the instrument or his technique were anything but peculiar to himself. Music historian David Campbell expounded on how Jones played the unitar, writing, \\"He played it by sliding a half-pint bottle along the wire with his left hand, while striking it near the resonating can with a little whittled stick in his right hand\\". It is directly related to the diddley bow, which in itself derived from West African instruments; however, Jones's practice of percussively sounding the resonator, and unorthodox sliding was far removed from known slide and bottleneck techniques. In 1960, Jones approached record producer Frederick Usher Jr., with his unitar in hand. Usher had been investigating the skid row district, spectating the offerings of several street performers, and was immediately intrigued by Jones's otherworldly sound. On February 14, 1960, Jones and Usher recorded a raw set of blues standards in a back alley on a portable tape recorder. Over the course of a few months, the two came together for two additional recording sessions in the more practical settings of a studio to cut a total of nine songs. Jones even agreed to perform for a private party for Usher's associates, where he openly resented having to share the stage with Usher's other discovery, harmonica player \\"Poor Traveling\\" Edward Hazelton. Hazelton, too, was a drifter, originally from South Carolina, who accompanied himself with the harmonica. Having no aspirations for fame, afterwards, the two musicians disappeared from any further documentation, never to record again. In 1964, Usher partially released the recordings of Jones and Hazelton on the album \\"One String\\" Jones and Edward Hazelton - One String Blues, which was distributed on Takoma Records. The album questionably states that Jones accompanied himself on a homemade \\"Zither-monochord\\", and opens with an interview with Jones describing his instrumental methods and notoriety in Skid Row. In 1993, Gazelle Productions reissued the album under the simplified title One String Blues, with six additional tracks. Captain Beefheart endorsed Jones's material in a 1995 excerpt of Mojo magazine's featured topic called \\"The Greatest Thing I've Ever Heard All Year\\". As a result, Jones's music and the mystery of his life are examined by blues enthusiasts. In 2002, One String Blues was re-released on Big Beat Records.

As a refugee from religious persecution, he was educated in Switzerland and became a Calvinist pastor, humanist, poet, polemicist, and diplomat.Charles Dardier, Jean de Serres, historiographe du roi, in Revue historique, XXII et XXIII, 1883, esp. p. 292. His complete translation of Plato appeared in the famous 1578 edition published by Henri Estienne, which is the source of the standard 'Stephanus numbers' still used by scholars to refer to Plato's works. In 1596, de Serres was appointed 'Historian of France' by King Henry IV. His posthumously published History of France was an 'immense success' and was not superseded for almost a century.For references, see below.  Early life  Geneva (about 1600) was a refuge for Protestants fleeing the religious wars in France, including Jean de Serres and his family. The words at top read 'After darkness, light.' Portrait of John Calvin, Protestant theologian. He was born at Villeneuve-de-Berg, France, in a Calvinist family. His mother was Louise de L√©ris (or Lheris). He was the brother of the celebrated agriculturalist Olivier de Serres and of another brother Raymond. Jean de Serres married a daughter of Pierre Godary and Bernardine Richier named Marguerite on April 25, 1569. The bride's family were French Protestent refugees from Lorraine living, like de Serres, in Switzerland. The marriage produced nine children.Dardier, p. 298 ff. At about the age of 13, de Serres escaped from France into Switzerland to avoid the persecutions and massacres of Protestants that preceded the French Wars of Religion (1562‚Äì98).Dardier, p. 295. He studied classical literature at the Acad√©mie de Lausanne (now the University of Lausanne) in Switzerland from 1557 to 1559, and then theology at the Acad√©mie de Gen√®ve (now the University of Geneva) until 1566. He was a member of the first class to attend this school, which was founded by Calvin himself. He was next a pastor at the Reformed Church of Jussy. In 1569-71, de Serres began publishing his Commentaries on the State of Religion and the Republic in the Kingdom of France, which described the recent massacres and civil war in France. It was written in Latin to appeal to a European-wide audience and was extended and reprinted many times.Dardier, p. 301 ff. According to de Serres, the Queen, Catherine de' Medici, had long plotted the destruction of Protestantism, and the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre of 1572 was only the culmination of her plans.Dardier, p. 309 ff. Translation of Plato Plato's Dialogues were translated in 1578 by Jean de Serres and edited by Henri Estienne, image of copy owned by John Adams (1735 ‚Äì 1826), second President of the United States After falling out with the consistory of Geneva, he returned to Lausanne, Switzerland, where he became the principal of the college.Dardier, p. 298 ff. He arrived in 1572 at the same time as many refugees escaping the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre. There, he turned from religious controversies and devoted some two years to translating Plato: > As after a grave illness, my bodily forces were exhausted. There was no kind > of study that might assure me of some repose, and I searched anxiously on > all sides for a way to employ my leisure, not knowing on what to settle. God > then furnished me an opportunity which kept me occupied for two years with > the study of the philosophy of Plato. This was for me a grand pleasure and a > release from occupations of various kinds that had assailed me.Dardier, p. > 311 ff. (Eng. trans. Jd'A.) After many delays, this work 'which the world of learning throughout Europe awaited with impatience' finally appeared in the Spring of 1578.Reverdin, p. 245. The three-volume, bilingual edition (Greek and Latin) was some 2,000 pages long. De Serres contributed the abundant notes that accompany his translations, the prefaces, and the analyses of each dialogue. It was 'for two centuries the indispensable instrument of Plato studies.'Reverdin, p. 239. Later controversies De Serres' translation of Plato further burnished his reputation, and he was called to N√Æmes in 1579 to reform the city's college. While in N√Æmes, he published a commentary on the book of Ecclesiastes that asserted the book had an underlying, philosophical unity.Dardier, p. 314-5. From about 1579, de Serres became an associate of Henry of Navarre, later King Henri IV. In 1582-1586, he published Four Anti-Jesuit Tracts that aimed to demonstrate the 'errors, abuse, and superstitions of Catholicism' and defend Calvinist doctrine.Dardier, p. 315. In 1589, he became the pastor at the city of Orange. A General History of France, by Jean de Serres In 1596, King Henri IV named de Serres the 'Historian of France.' He was employed by the king, both in France and abroad, to attempt to bring about a rapprochement between the warring religious sects in France. This led to a national controversy that caused the great majority of both Calvinists and Catholics to distrust de Serres.Charles Dardier, Jean de Serres, historiographe du roi, in Revue historique, XXII et XXIII, 1883, p. 292. He died in 1598 after a short illness, which his contemporaries believed was the result of poisoning.Dardier, p. 325. (Eng. trans. by J'dA) His short history of France, Inventaire de l'Histoire de France, was published shortly after his death. According to Dardier, 'The success of the Inventaire was immense, and it was deserved... For the first time, the facts were presented in chronological order, clearly and methodically. This work was not superseded until 1683 ...'Dardier, p. 325. (Eng. trans. by J'dA) He was not so much a 'defender of religious tolerance' (a concept that became common only in the Eighteenth Century) as much as an advocate of the union of the two main sects, the Calvinists and Catholics. This earned him the opprobrium of his coreligionists and the reputation of a renegade, a legend that was spread by certain contemporary writers.Institut de Olivier Serres, http://www.olivier-de- serres.org/jean.php Accessed November 16, 2015. Poems The title reads Funeral Monument of Monsieur Jean de Serres, Minister of the Word of God in the Church at Orange. A book of poems by de Serres, entitled Tombeau ('Funeral Monument'), was published soon after his death. A single copy was discovered in 2013 in the library at Grenoble. According to Vidal, de Serres' poems 'attest to his fidelity to the reformed religion and contradict the slanders made about his faith.'Dominique Vidal, 'Le Tombeau po√©tique de Jean de Serres, historiographe du roi, imprim√© en 1598 √† Montpellier, pour contrer l‚Äôoubli et la calomnie,' Bulletin de la Soci√©t√© de l‚ÄôHistoire du Protestantisme Fran√ßais, Dec. 2013, v. 159, pp. 609-622.

It is found only in the mountains of western China where it inhabits grassland, shrubby marshes and steppes. Although it has a limited range, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of \\"least concern\\". Description The Lama dwarf hamster has a head-and-body length of between and a tail length of . It is very similar in appearance to the Chinese striped hamster (Cricetulus barabensis), but is rather smaller, has a shorter tail and lacks the blackish markings on the dorsal fur and upper thighs that that species often has. The dorsal fur is dark greyish-brown, the underparts are greyish white and there is a sharp dividing line where the two colours meet. The tail is thick and well-covered with guard hairs, having a dark stripe at the top and otherwise being white, with a wholly white tip. Distribution and habitat The Lama dwarf hamster is endemic to western China where it is found in the Tibet Autonomous Region. It is a mountain species and is found at high altitudes. Its typical habitat is upland grasslands, shrubby marshes and open steppe. Behaviour The behaviour of the Lama dwarf hamster has been little studied but it is believed to be similar to that of the Chinese striped hamster, in fact some authorities consider the Lama dwarf hamster to be a subspecies of C. barabensis. It lives in a burrow, ventures out to forage for seeds, carries some back to the burrow to store in specially constructed chambers and breeds in the summer. Status The Lama dwarf hamster has a limited range but is presumed to have a large total population. The population trend is unknown, but no particular threats have been identified and it may be present in some protected areas. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has therefore assessed the hamster's conservation status as being of \\"least concern\\".

He was the first person of the name Chisholm to come to Australia and is considered the patriarch of the Clan Chisholm in that country. From being a private, then corporal (1798) and sergeant (1808), in the New South Wales Corps, he became a prominent merchant in Sydney. Chisholm was a founder and director of the Bank of New South Wales, a leader in the movement for democratic reform, a humanitarian benefactor, and one of the largest landholders in New South Wales.  Early life and military service  Chisholm was born at Mid Calder, in the Scottish lowlands some 15 miles west of Edinburgh, the third child of John Chisholm and his wife Isabel n√©e Wilson, and was baptized at the kirk of Calder on 2 February 1772. His other siblings were Elizabeth (b. 1768), Alexander Hugh (1770‚Äì1850) and Mary (c. 1782‚Äì1835). On 14 November 1788, at the age of 16, Chisholm enlisted in the 29th Regiment of Foot with a letter of recommendation from either the Hon. Robert Sandilands or his cousin James Sandilands the Ninth Lord Torphichen, the local Baron and principal heritor of the kirk of Calder. He maintained correspondence with the Tenth Baron after his establishment in New South Wales. Chisholm transferred to the New South Wales Corps, commanded by Major Francis Grose, at Forton Barracks in Gosport, on 11 July 1790, with the rank of private and the occupation of \\"taylor\\".  Master taylor of the New South Wales Corps (1791‚Äì1810)  James Chisholm travelled to New South Wales as part of the Third Fleet contingent of the New South Wales Corps, as a guard of convicts on the whaler Britannia, leaving Portsmouth on 27 March and arriving at Port Jackson on 14 October 1791. He was assigned to Major Francis Grose's Headquarters Company from the time of his arrival in the colony. In 1793, Chisholm assisted the Surveyor-General, Baron Augustus Alt, to set out town allotments along Spring Row (later George Street, Sydney). These lots, adjacent to the new Parade Ground and Barracks, were allocated to six non-commissioned members of the New South Wales Corps, including one for Chisholm himself, where he resided until 1821‚Äì22. At this time he undertook the duties of a tailor and by July 1798, when he was promoted to Corporal, became \\"master taylor\\" of the New South Wales Corps, operating this function from his establishment in Spring Row. Because of these duties, Chisholm did not have active involvement in the suppression of the Castle Hill Rebellion of 1804. On 26 January 1806, at the age of 34, he married the 21-year-old Mary Brown, daughter of the Scottish free settler David Brown. Later that year their son, James Chisholm Junior, was born.Births, Deaths and Marriages, V1806 660 3A and V1806 333 4. James Chisholm was illiterate at the time of his marriage but, under Mary's tutelage, was later able to read and write as early as 1808 when he was promoted to sergeant. Chisholm was not a major player in the Rum Rebellion, which deposed Governor Bligh in January 1808. He was aligned with Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Foveaux, whom he claimed as a friend, and Lieutenant Colonel William Paterson, both of whom were opposed to the perpetrators of the Rebellion, principally Major George Johnston and John Macarthur. Governor Macquarie later favoured Chisholm for his loyalty to the Crown. Moreover, unlike the officers of the New South Wales Corps, there is no evidence that Chisholm was involved in the rum trade or any other private enterprise before 1808. However, in that year he commenced dealing as an agent in real estate and mortgage transactions, obtained his first rural land grant at the Eastern Farms and began trading in agricultural commodities. In February 1809, Chisholm purchased for ¬£140 the lease on two town lots measuring \\"141 feet in front, 175 feet in length\\", previously owned by Sergeant-Major William Jamieson, and adjacent to his own land in Spring Row. On 5 March 1809, he obtained a licence to retail wine and spirits from Jamieson's former premises, later named the Crown and Thistle, a licence he held continuously until 1822.  Merchant of Sydney (1810‚Äì1823)  With the arrival of Colonel Lachlan Macquarie as Governor of New South Wales, on 11 February 1810 James Chisholm requested and received his discharge from the army, after 21 years service. He never returned to military service nor the tailoring trade. With the support of Colonel Foveaux, Macquarie also renewed the leases to Chisholm's land in George Street (as Spring Row was renamed that year). Macquarie, in a concerted effort to shut down the rum trade, also restricted the number of persons licensed to retail spirits. Nevertheless, he granted James Chisholm one of only 20 liquor licenses issued on 16 February 1810. Chisholm then launched into a career as an importer and retailer of wine and spirits, a producer of rural produce for sale into the Commissariat, a trustee of deceased estates and mortgages, and a land agent and developer; as a consequence of his mercantile interests, he was an early agitator for monetary reform and the establishment of a colonial currency. He also began to accumulate town and country real estate in his own right, eventually spending some ¬£12,000 on land and owning 23,000 acres stretching from the County of Cumberland to the Southern Tablelands. By the late 1820s Chisholm was one of the six largest landholders in New South Wales, and by the 1880s his descendants owned 3,125 square miles of Australia, stretching from the Gulf of Carpentaria to the state of Victoria. James Chisholm's Sydney real estate included a 379-foot frontage (a block of more than one acre) along the eastern side of George Street, the main thoroughfare of Sydney. With a few minor set-backs, the diversity of his business allowed him to weather the economic crisis of 1812‚Äì1815 and he became a wealthy and influential Sydney merchant. Chisholm's first wife, Mary, died on 17 December 1817, aged only 32. Soon after, the 11-year-old James Chisholm Junior travelled to Calcutta, where he lived, worked, and received schooling, under the care of his father's business partner John Campbell Burton. In August 1818, while his son was away in India, Chisholm Senior, now 46, married his second wife the 21-year-old Mary Bowman (1796‚Äì1878), daughter of John and Honor Bowman of Archerfield, Richmond, New South Wales. The Bowmans had arrived as free immigrants on the Barwell in 1798. In 1817, Chisholm was one of the \\"principal merchants\\" invited by Governor Macquarie to a meeting that led to the formation of Australia's first trading bank. In June 1822, Chisholm sold his spirits licence to Mary Reiby and leased his Crown and Thistle inn to the newly formed Bank of New South Wales, wherein it conducted business until 1853. He was an original shareholder in the bank and later became a director (1826).Appendix to Commissioner Bigge's Report of 1820, Bonwick Transcripts, 1641‚Äì1892, Mitchell Library: BT 1‚Äì88, Series 1, BT 27, CY1505, frame 42ff. In 1821‚Äì22, Chisholm commenced building a country house on his 57-acre Newtown Farm, at what is today the suburb of Redfern. This he named Calder House, after the Torphichen mansion in Scotland, and it became his principal residence for the remainder of his life. Newtown Farm was chosen as the site for the Eveleigh Railway Workshops in 1875 and Calder House was destroyed by fire in 1923. In 1823, Chisholm also constructed a three-story stone townhouse, next to the Bank of NSW, at 85 George Street, Sydney.  Religion, education, public service, politics and later life (1823‚Äì1837)  James Chisholm gave to public and private charitable institutions and served on their councils and committees. He was a reformed evangelical Christian, many of the charities he supported being sponsored by the Presbyterian Church, but he also supported the construction of the first Roman Catholic chapel in Hyde Park. Chisholm contributed to the establishment of Scots Church in Sydney (1826), and its associated religious-social schemes, principally through his loyalty to Rev. John Dunmore Lang (1799‚Äì1878). He was a founding trustee of the Sydney Public Free Grammar School of Dr Laurence Hynes Halloran (1824), and became a member of its management committee (1825), was a founding governor of Sydney College (1830), and a supporter, shareholder and councilor of Lang‚Äôs Presbyterian School, Australian College (1831).Great Britain, Colonial Office New South Wales Governor‚Äôs Dispatches, 1813‚Äì1879: State Library of New South Wales, Mitchell Library Call Numbers (ML) A 1203, Reel CY536, frame 80ff. In the field of assisted emigration, Chisholm was a committee member and treasurer of Lang‚Äôs Emigrant‚Äôs Friend Society (1832). In addition to his interests in the Bank of NSW, Chisholm was a founding shareholder in the Bank of Australia (July 1826), and later a trustee of the Savings Bank of NSW, which opened on 18 August 1832 at his three-story house next door to the trading bank. Chisholm had long and active involvement in the colonial court system of NSW (1822‚Äì37): he was one of two members of the Governor‚Äôs Court, appointed by Governor Macquarie (1822‚Äì23); and a member of the ‚Äògrand juries‚Äô and juries of the Quarter Sessions courts (1823‚Äì36), being their first Foreman (1824). He was prominent in initiatives for political change through his association with the reforms of William Charles Wentworth (1790‚Äì1872). He supported Wentworth in his campaigns for trial by jury, taxation reform and representative government in the form of an elected Legislative Assembly, being a founding member of the Australian Patriotic Association (1835). Although aligned with Lang and Wentworth, Chisholm was not a radical ‚Äì his politics would appear conservative to modern observers ‚Äì but in the context of colonial NSW they were democratic and reformist. Throughout his public service, he maintained his family and business interests, and remained loyal to his friends: as an example, along with his friend John Dickson, he provided co-surety of ¬£6,000 for William Douglas Campbell in his legal suit against the estate of his former business partner, Garnham Blaxcell (1823‚Äì27). In 1834, the Colonial Secretary, Alexander Macleay, asked James Chisholm to justify his ownership of his land in George Street after a legal challenge from a descendant of William Jamieson. In this Chisholm was successful, and all the leases along the east side of George Street, between Hunter and King Street, were converted to freehold. A series of stores and tenements had been built on the George Street lots, with Chisholm‚Äôs tenants providing him with rental income. He sold a small portion of this land in January 1836, but his family retained the remainder until the 1880s.  Death  In March 1837, James Chisholm visited the house his eldest son had built at his property, Kippilaw, some 8 miles west of Goulburn, New South Wales. Here he caught a cold that turned to pneumonia. He was driven by carriage back to Calder House in Sydney, where he died on 31 March, aged 65. His second wife, his eldest son James Junior and seven children of his second marriage, the last child Edwin being born eight months before his death, survived him. Chisholm was initially buried on Newtown Farm, according to the rites of the Presbyterian Church, but the remains were moved with his first wife to St Stephen‚Äôs Church of England Cemetery, Camperdown, in 1867, where they remain to this day. The inscription on his grave states that he departed this life \\"leaving a numerous family to lament their loss. He was a native of Scotland and upwards of 47 years a resident of this Colony, where he maintained a character which for simplicity of manner and integrity will long be remembered.\\"  Legacy  James Chisholm's legacy as a wealthy merchant, political reformer and landowner, was built upon by his descendants. His widow Mary Chisholm was a successful pastoralist and businesswoman in her own right. His eldest son James became a pioneer sheep breeder and woolgrower, an elected member of parliament for the seat of King and Georgiana (1851‚Äì56), voting for the Constitution Act, that conferred responsible government in NSW (1864), and a Legislative Councillor (1865‚Äì88). James Junior, his sons and his half-brother John William, expanded the Chisholm family land holdings over the Breadalbane Plains and beyond throughout the nineteenth century, eventually controlling two million acres of Australia.

It is a three star hotel in the resort village of Pontresina, slightly less than two hours (depending on road/rail conditions) to the south of Chur in Graub√ºnden, Switzerland. The hotel comprises 140 beds in 82 rooms, with underground parking for 60 cars. During the summer season its focus is on hikers and mountain bikers, while winter season guests mostly come for the skiing and other winter sports. Brief history The history of the hotel goes back to the boom in Swiss tourism during the second half of the nineteenth century. The founder of the hotel, Florian Stoppany, who came from a family of bakers and confectioners, acquired the \\"Maison Stiffler\\", a village guest house, and employed the architect Jakob Ragaz to expand it into the mid-sized Post Hotel Pontresina, which opened in 1881. The further expansion to a first class renaissance revival hotel took place in 1895.Isabelle Rucki: Hotels in Pontresina. Kantonale Denkmalpflege, Chur 1984/85, p. 106 From now on the clientele of what was now known as the Hotel Pontresina came increasingly from the German upper middle class. Following the installation of central heating, in 1906/07, for the first time, the hotel opened for a winter season. In 1909 a company acquired the hotel from the Stoppany family, but the family remained closely involved. The First World War which broke out in 1914 marked the start of a long period of decline in the hotel's fortunes. Two World Wars and the years of austerity that followed the Wall Street Crash of 1929, combined with large and sudden fluctuations in currency exchange rates meant that there were many years between 1914 and the 1950s when the guests stayed away. Borrowings from the Cantonal Credit Institution (\\"B√ºndner Kreditgenossenschaft\\") and other financial support organisations failed to preserve the hotel's independence, and in the 1930s it fell into the hands of the Cantonal Bank. This was also the decade during which, in 1936, the hotel acquired its present (2015) name, becoming the \\"Sporthotel Pontresina\\". The 1960s brought a new era of mass tourism, and during the middle of the decade the bank embarked on the hotel's first significant renovation programme in half a century, and the upgrade continued after 1972 when the hotel passed from the ownership of the bank to that of the municipality. Most of the rooms acquired en suite bathrooms, and the modernised conference and meeting rooms together with enhanced facilities for sports equipment storage and drying enabled the hotel to broaden its appeal and provided for a new start. In 2010 the municipality sold the hotel to a new company, \\"Sporthotel Pontresina AG\\", owned by the Pampel family. Site The hotel is built on a well chosen site, in the centre of Pontresina, directly on the east side what was till 1963/65 the main through route linking St. Moritz with the Bernina Pass and Italy. (Since 1964 a replacement main road on the other side of the little valley has carried the through traffic, and the hotel itself is in a zone where traffic speeds are restricted to 30 km/h.) Although the three little hamlets that comprised Pontresina have become contiguous, back in 1881 the site of the hotel was a large piece of open ground between the hamlets of Laret and St.Spiert, which provided space for expansion. Expansion directly beside the main street during the 1890s nevertheless involved the acquisition and replacement of neighbouring properties, and the floor-plan of the hotel was further complicated by the slope of the site. Another advantage of the relatively large plot of land was the opportunity afforded for good views from the hotel and its garden towards the Roseg valley and glacier. Because Stoppany's plot extended to the opposite, western, side of the street, n one could block the view with new buildings. At the lower part of the plot it adjoined a road leading towards the Roseg Valley, and there was space in the hotel grounds for stables and a laundry, hidden by the fall of the land from the sight-line of hotel guests, despite their proximity to the main building. In the end the transport infrastructure won, however, with the opening on 1 July 1908 of the branch railway line, and the little street at the lower end of the plot acquired its present name, Station Street (Via da la Staziun / Bahnhofstrasse). Chronology=Background In 1850 Pontresina contained around 270 registered inhabitants, living from agriculture and welcoming the occasional traveller approaching the little used Bernina Pass. Early in the nineteenth century reconstruction/rediscovery of the Julier, Maloja and Albula Passes, which since the end of the Roman empire had become mere bridle paths, marked a lessening of the isolation of the Engadin. The Swiss postal service was founded in 1848 and inaugurated a stagecoach service providing, for the first time, a regularly operated transport network. The development was associated with a tourism surge. Early beneficiaries were Tarasp and St. Moritz, two resorts able to boast spa facilities, and it was in these two resorts that the first new hotels in the Engadin region were built. The first visitors mostly came because their doctors had recommended a health cure, but these were soon joined by more recreational travellers. From about 1850 there was a rapid growth in mountaineering as a leisure activity. Pioneering mountain tourists, many of whom came from England, favoured Pontresina over St. Moritz as a starting point for their Engadin climbing holidays. The first edition of 's \\"Piz Languard Und Die Bernina-gruppe Bei Pontresina, Oberengadin\\" appeared in 1858. In this early tour guide the parish priest for St. Moritz and Samedan described the hiking and mountaineering tours in a wide area around Pontresina. The local \\"Improvement Association\\" (\\"Versch√∂nerungsverein\\") was founded in 1872 and by the 1890s had laid out a network of paths and riding tracks extending to more than 80 km (50 miles). The routes were given euphonous names such as \\"Schluchtenpromenade\\", \\"Thaispromenade\\" or \\"Flazpromenade\\" and their total cost was recorded as 35,151 Swiss francs. Visitors were accommodated in simple guest houses such as the \\"Wirtschaft zur Krone\\" (which subsequently morphed into the \\"Grand Hotel Kronenhof\\"), and often also in rented rooms in the homes of private individuals. From 1870 sustained demand for accommodation led to a hotels building boom, and by 1890 a number of hotels lined the main street (Via Maistra), as they do today. Hotel Pontresina and Post (1881) Construction of the Hotel Pontresina & Post On left of the block is the former Photographic shop recently acquired from Alexander Flury. In the centre is what till now had been the \\"Maison Stiffler\\" guesthouse. To the right, the ground floor of the four floor extension on the southern end of the site has already been built. Most of the many hotels in Pontresina were either constructed as purpose built or else the result of a change of use for an existing house. The Sporthotel Pontresina's structure results from a more convoluted and iterative series of steps. The hotel that opened in 1881 still, in most respects, comprised at its heart the old \\"Maison Stiffler\\" guest house, which itself dated back only to 1866, but the architect brothers Ragaz also integrated into the overall building the previously separate photographic shop acquired from the photographer, named Alex Flury.Michael Caviezel: Das Engadin in Wort und Bild. Tanner, Samedan 1893, pp. 178, 183, 316. On the ground floor of the former photographic shop the hotelier Stoppany installed Pontresina's (second) post station, to generate customers for the hotel and its restaurant. The Hotel Pontresina after the 1881 rebuild (now with the new church behind it). The architects designed a new unifying facade for the combined buildings and added an extra floor on the top of what had been the Maison Stiffler, resulting in a four-storey building. With the traditional \\"Post Hotel\\" (\\"Hotel Post\\") nomenclature and an increased number of relatively basic rooms this part of the hotel provided a suitable overnight halt for stage coach passengers and other guests with simple requirements. The fourth floor extension on the main building applied a simplified reading of the Renaissance Revival style, its flat roof topped off with a large \\"Hotel Pontresina\\" sign. Its significantly greater height caused it to tower above the less flamboyantly restyled building beside it. The embellishment elements of the five-section front facade were mostly formed of wood, sheet metal and zinc castings, coated in stone coloured paint. The ground floor contained the reception area and the restaurant, which was open to passing trade as well as to hotel guests not wishing to spend time and money on a bit meal (so eating \\"√† la carte\\"). At the back of the building the ground floor also incorporated the kitchens for the restaurant and hotel. Upstairs, the more expensive guest rooms were on the first and second floors, benefitting from the large windows conferred by the remodelled facade on the building's western (front) face, which provided views over the road towards the Roseg valley and glacier. The two corner rooms were particularly coveted, thanks to the small balconies emerging from the bevelled corner shape of the building. The more modest top floor rooms were provided for guests with less demanding requirements and for the servants accompanying some of the more affluent guests. The 1881 extension left the hotel with a capacity of around 66 beds.Frederick de Beauchamp Strickland: The Engadin. A Guide to the district. Sampson Low and Co., London 1891, p. 222. Guests were politely but firmly informed - here in three languages - that when they arrived late they would miss out on those courses that had already been served. The middle column, in English, includes the injunction: On the western face of the building, close to the mountainside, the grand dining room was positioned above the kitchen on the first floor. Its height encompassed both the first and second floors. Guests eating here benefitted from a multi-course menu, albeit without being able to select individually the dishes they wished to be served. Most guests dined at the long banquet style table (the \\"Table d‚Äôh√¥te\\"). Main meals were served at fixed times - 13.00 and 19.30 - and guests were politely but firmly informed that when they arrived late they would miss out on those courses that had already been served. (\\"Herrschaften, die versp√§tet ankommen, werden mit laufender Platte servier'\\".Avis an die G√§ste, verwahrt in der Dokumentensammlung Sporthotel Pontresina im Schweizerischen Wirtschaftsarchiv (SWA) in Basel, Signatur H + I E 65.) For a supplementary payment of 1 Swiss franc (lunch) or 2 Swiss francs (dinner) guests could elect to be served not at the shared long table but at separately assigned small tables. The original painted ceiling of the grand dining room is today hidden behind a painted plaster ceiling. Separated and hidden, in a hidden mezzanine gallery, was the storage location for the hotel silver, plates and dishes, together with heated hotplates and centre pieces for the tables and other elements appropriate to the quality of the guests and their formal meals at the \\"Table d‚Äôh√¥te\\". Above the dining room, on the fourth floor, there were more of the modest hotel rooms, similar to those on the fourth floor at the front of the building. Individual private guest bathrooms, even in the most exclusive hotels, were not usual in Europe in the 1880s. Each floor had a grouping of washrooms and wcs, more than sufficient for the number of bedrooms, beside the main staircase. If a guest wished to take a bath a zinc bathtub would be produced and placed in the guest's bedroom, and filled with water by hotel staff using jugs, in a manner that would have reflected the arrangements in the homes of the more affluent guests. Although there was at this stage no plumbed water supply to the guest bedrooms, for basic personal ablution, urination and defecation, rooms were provided with their own jugs, basins and night chamber pots. The hotel still retains a few porcelain examples, inscribed with the prestigious names of their manufacturers Brown-Westhead, Moore & Co and Villeroy & Boch. Electric lighting was already installed by 1891. Guests prepared to pay a supplement were even able to specify electric lighting for their bedrooms in place of the more conventional (and dimmer) candle lighting. Across the main street guests could use the hotel terrace, with views of the hotel gardens sloping away towards the mountain stream flowing through the resort and higher, up across to the Roseg valley. Beneath the terrace was a cellar, used for storage, and accessible from the main hotel cellar using a tunnel under the main street. Two wooden pavilions enabled guests to sit and enjoy the gardens while protected from sun and rain. Hotel Pontresina (1895) Hotel Pontresina Commercial success permitted Stoppany to enlarge his hotel in 1895. The rebuild provided for a capacity increase to 150 rooms with 200 beds.Die Schweiz. Praktisches Handbuch f√ºr Reisende. Griebens Reiseb√ºcher. Volume 23, 19th edition, Albert Goldschmidt, Berlin 1899, p. 330. Guests had also become more demanding in terms of creature comforts since 1880: the Hotel Pontresina of 1895 was able to compete on equal terms at the top end of the market with recently constructed or renovated rival establishments in Pontresina and St. Moritz. For the planning, Florian Stoppany again employed the architect Jakob Ragaz. What had been the \\"new extension\\" on the southern end of the building, back in 1881, was retained, and a new northern wing was now joined to it, replacing the old \\"Maison Stiffler\\" guest house and former photographer's shop. The greater overall symmetry of the resulting structure made for an imposing contemporary palace-style hotel. The replacement of the \\"Hotel Post\\" portion of the old building also triggered a name change: now the hotel was known simply as the \\"Hotel Pontresina\\". Within his enlarged hotel Stoppany was no keen able to accommodate the postal and communications facilities, and these were repositioned in 1894/95 to a new purpose built post office at Via Maistra 160, on a readily identifiable site across the road to the south, marked today (2015) by the current \\"Hotel Post\\". The architect Ragaz again chose the Renaissance Revival style, which balanced the 1881 extension. However, a more ornate interpretation was adopted, respecting fashion changes during the intervening fifteen years. All parts of the building were placed securely on a single four sided basement. Because of the slope of the land the northern portion of the building was given an additional floor beneath the level of the main first floor but above the basement section. The roofline from the middle section followed the line of the existing attic windows as did the curved lintels over the palladian-style windows. Facing the street on the building's western side, above front facade and the central lintel, in very large letters, was written \\"Pontresina‚àíHotel‚àíPontresina\\". The side facades on the southern and northern ends were now much more impressive. The 1881 extension had featured balconies for the corner rooms on the first and second floors, but now most of the first and second floor rooms incorporated a window with its own small balcony, even on the building's north face. Other ornamentation included little round niches, containing small Swiss crosses, reflecting the increasingly assertive nationalism of the age. The streetside beveled corners of the hotel building were built out, first on the northwest corner and subsequently on the southwest corner, and topped off with little crowned domes. The large western facade facing the main street was repositioned a little away from the road, making space for a terrace between the public street and the hotel's public rooms. It was no longer necessary for guests to cross the road in order to sit on the hotel terrace and watch the traffic and bustle along the increasingly busy road to the Bernina Pass, beyond which the more distant view across to the Roseg Valley, its glacier, and the surrounding mountains remained for most purposes unimpaired. The hall- lounge with the fireplace to the right The corner rooms were as large as the best rooms in the hotel and could be booked with exclusive use of an adjacent bathroom (but they were slightly further than the best rooms from the lift/elevator) Church of San Nicul√≤ During the final decades of the nineteenth century there had been a trend for an enlargement of public spaces where hotel guests could meet and interact socially, and Ragaz now incorporated these trends in his enlarged ground floor design, with a large new vestibule, extending across the entire width of the central part of the structure, placed beside the existing (since 1881) restaurant. Other \\"public\\" rooms accessible to guests included a bar, a writing room, a substantial shop space (described in the architect's plan a \\"bank\\") and even, at the northern end of the building, a room designated in the architect's plan for \\"ping- pong\\". The large vestibule was dominated by an impressive wrought iron staircase, while the former main staircase at the southern end of the building was now designated as \\"side-staircase\\". There was another \\"side-staircase\\" towards the hotel's northern end. Each of the side-staircases had two wcs positioned beside them, while the in pride of place, positioned by the new main staircase, there was now a lift (elevator), adumbrating a trend that would become mainstream in European luxury hotels after 1900. The hotel manager's own office was positioned to the right of the main entrance on the hotel's western face, mirroring the position of the guests' writing room to the left of the entrance. In anticipation of intensive footfall, the entire vestibule was given a tiled floor (today covered over with a carpet) using the \\"Mettlacher Platten\\" (Mettlach process tiles) developed by (1782-1858) and supplied by Villeroy & Boch. To the left of the vestibule, the front half of the new northern wing was, on the ground floor, entirely occupied by a large hall-lounge. At one end of this area, beside the vestibule and separated from the rest of the hall by glass doors and a glass partition, was the hotel library, comprising more than 300 volumes, kept in a large wall mounted glass fronted bookcase. At the heart of the room, on its eastern side, was the fireplace. Elsewhere clusters of arm chairs and sofas were grouped around low tables. The walls were coated in fabric and the hall featured parquet flooring. The adjacent games room, allocated in the architect's drawing to \\"ping-pong\\", has at different times been used as a billiards room and as a bridge (card game) room. On the right side of the vestibule, the restaurant and bar in front half of the 1881 southern wing were unchanged. In the southwestern corner the former reception area was replaced by a shop space, identified in the architect's plan as a \\"bank\\". On the far side of the building, the enlargement of the hotel called for an extension to the grand dining room: this was extended to the south, raising its capacity by approximately 50%. Two broad arched windows on what had previously been the external southern wall of the room were adapted as arches connecting the new and old parts of the enlarged dining room. Upstairs, in the new northern wing the rooms layouts on the first, second and third floors were virtually identical. Rooms were lined up on either side of a single corridor, which on the western (street) side of the building was broader, but divided by the atrium, a shared bathroom, the enclosed northern side-staircase and the lift/elevator. The corridor turned through 90 degrees at the north-western corner of the building and the corridor along the north side of the building had rooms on each side. During the 1890s en-suite bathrooms were still very unusual, but in the 1895 design for the Hotel Pontresina there were a few bathrooms placed between some of the bedrooms, connected by inter-connecting doors, which could be reserved to just one or two of the adjacent guest rooms according to which of the interconnecting doors were made available and which were locked. Although there was still no question of individual bathrooms for each of the guest rooms, the ratio of bathrooms and wcs to guest rooms was very much more generous than the 1:20 (bathrooms) and 1:8 (wcs) recommended in the newly updated (1894 edition) \\"Architecture Handbook\\"Handbuch der Architektur IV. Theil: Entwerfen, Anlage und Einrichtung der Geb√§ude, 4. Halbband: Geb√§ude f√ºr Erholungs-, Beherbergungs- und Vereinszwecke. 2. Auflage. Arnold Bergstr√§sser, Darmstadt 1894, p. 226. The best rooms, both on account of their size and because of the view across the valley to the Roseg glacier, were in the middle part of the building on its front/west facing facade. Importantly, these were close to the lift/elevator, and could be offered with exclusive use of adjacent bathrooms. There were three of these rooms on each floor, positioned contiguously, and the central one of the three could be redesignated as a private \\"salon\\" attached to the adjacent bedroom. For larger parties, by issuing the keys for the appropriate communicating doors it was also possible to convert a group of three adjacent rooms into an apartment of three large rooms with its own bathroom. The flexibility available from issuing guests with keys enabling them to use communicating doors connecting to an adjacent guest room or bathroom was not restricted to the large rooms on the hotel's western face. The same adaptations could be made in respect of the smaller less expensive rooms facing north or south along, the building's north wing, but the view to the north featured no glaciers. Instead, guest looking out from these rooms could observe the reformed-evangelical Church of San Nicul√≤, the hamlet-district of Pontersina- Laret, and on the horizon above and beyond these, the Piz Julier (mountain). Following the 1895 rebuild, all the rooms incorporated electric lighting. The electricity came from a generator in the cellar. Boom and bubble (1901-1914) The hotel founder Florian Stoppany died on 25 January 1901. His wife had died five years earlier. Direction of the hotel passed to his eldest son, Johann Stoppany, and after 1906 his siblings' shares in the hotel were transferred to Johann. The siblings nevertheless remained active in the hospitality business. His eldest sister married a man called Christian Kuoni- Stoppany, and together in 1903 they took over the Grand Hotel Miramar in Santa Marherita on the Ligurian coast.Advertisement in the Engadin Express & Alpine Post. Nr. 10, 10 July 1903 In 1908 the second brother took over the new Station Restaurant in Pontresina, running it till after the First World War.Schweizerische Telegraphen- und Telephon-Verwaltung: Amtliches Verzeichnis der Telephon-Teilnehmer. 3, Kantone: Appenzell Ausserrhoden, Appenzell Innerrhoden, Glarus, Graub√ºnden, St. Gallen, Schaffhausen, Schwyz (Bezirke Einsiedeln, H√∂fe, March), Thurgau, Zug, Z√ºrich, F√ºrstentum Liechtenstein. Jahrg√§nge 1911, 1912, 1913, 1914, 1915, 1918 und 1919 (i.e. telephone directory) In 1901 the Hotel Pontresina was connected to the power grid. The existing electricity power generation set-up, which had been installed in 1891 was no longer needed, and records accordingly show the sale of two petrol (gasoline) powered DC generators, each rated at 7 hp and producing 40 amps at 120 volts. An accumulator battery and a circuit board were also sold off at this point.Advertisement in the: Schweizerische Bauzeitung. Volume 38 (1901), 28 September 1901 Hotel buses awaiting guests at Samedan railway station Technical progress also impacted transport links. On 1 July 1903 the Albula Railway opened between Thusis and Samedan, which connected the Engadin region with the cantonal capital, Chur. Hitherto hotel guests had been required to undergo a ten-hour journey, normally by post carriage, via the Julier or Albula Pass in order to reach Pontresina from Chur. That ten hour post carriage journey was now replaced with a four-hour railway journey. At Samedan Station trains were met by the Hotel Pontresina's own horse-drawn bus for the final 6 km (4 mile) climb up the valley to Pontresina.Schweizer Hotellier- Verein (Ed.): Die Hotels der Schweiz. 11th edition, 106, Schweizerische Verlagsdruckerei G. B√∂hm, Basel 1906, p. 155. It was exactly another five years before the branch line passing through Pontresina opened, on 1 July 1908, in the process linking the Albula railway to the Bernina railway and creating a through route to Tirano in Italy. A more rapid and, especially in Winter, more predictable transport link brought an increase in tourist numbers. In response, there was a sudden increase in tourist facilities, including a number of substantial new hotels, in Pontresina. Another result and driver of the tourism boom was the Funicular service that opened in 1907 between Punt Muragl and the new Muottas Muragl viewing station, part completed even before the Pontresina rail link itself. Existing hotels originally constructed to operate during the summer season now embarked on upgrades in order to accommodate a winter season clientele as well, in order to service more reliably the debt incurred to finance their construction. The Hotel Pontresina participated in this development. Since the 1891 enlargement, 16 of the hotel's 66 guest rooms had been provided with their own wood-burning stoves. Guests accommodated in these rooms were billed for using the stoves according to the number of crates of fire wood consumed. However, the room stoves were only ever intended to compensate for short episodes of cold weather, and it would not have been considered practical to operate them on a sustained basis through a winter season. For the 1906/07 winter season, therefore, a central heating system was installed,Hotel Pontresina, Price list 1906: Chauffage central en construction pour la saison d'hiver 1906/07. which was then extended in 1913.Engadin Express & Alpine Post, 9 December 1913, p. 14. New elaborate illustrated brochures were produced, with French and English language versions together with the German ones, in order to draw in more hotel guests for the winter season. New or expanded activities available included skiing, tobogganing, skijoring, ice skating and excursions by horse sled. Further innovations designed to build a winter season business included a programme of dances and costume balls arranged by the larger hotels, including the Hotel Pontresina, advertised both to their own guests and to guests of other Pontresina hotels.Engadin Express & Alpine Post, 4 February 1913 & 28 February 1913. In January 1913 one of the balls was held as a celebration of the German Kaiser's birthday.Engadin Express & Alpine Post, 30 January 1914. Something of an experiment, in the view of at least one contemporary reporter, was the introduction of the \\"Tango Tea party\\" at the Hotel Pontresina on 27 December 1913.\\"Tango Tea\\" im Hotel Pontresina. In: Engadin Express & Alpine Post. 30 December 1913, p. 36. Despite growth in tourist numbers, there are suggestions that the pace of new hotel construction at times outstripped demand. In 1890 there were 1,200 recorded hotel beds in Pontresina. That increased to 1,530 in 1900 and 1,850 in 1910.Hermann Gurtner: Die wirtschaftliche Bedeutung des schweizerischen Hotelgewerbes. Schweizer Hotelier-Verein, Basel 1939. Significant new openings included that of the \\"Hotel Schweizerhof\\" in 1905Isabelle Rucki: Das Hotel in den Alpen.

Institut f√ºr Geschichte und Theorie der Architektur, Z√ºrich 1989, , pp. 180-183. and of the \\"Hotel Palace\\" (today the \\"Hotel Walther\\") in 1907. 1908 saw the expansion of the hitherto insignificant, in capacity terms, \\"Hotel Enderlin\\", which was relaunched as the \\"Schlosshotel Enderlin\\" with a new structure that incorporated an arrestingly eye catching tower. The last significant new hotel in Pontresina before war broke out in 1914 was the \\"Hotel Rosatsch\\", built on the plot directly beside the Hotel Pontresina. With their fashionable new architecture - whether inspired by gothic castles or by more homely alpine chalets - and integrated modern facilities, these newly built hotels enjoyed a competitive advantage over the establishments built or extended back in the 1890s. In the increasingly fevered atmosphere of the period, on 15 July 1909 Johann Stoppany sold the hotel to the newly created \\"A.-G. Hotel Pontresina\\" company for a price of 1.06 million Swiss francs.Schweizerischen Handelsamtsblatt (SHAB) 25 August 1909, Nr. 214, p. 1467. At the same time the new company also spent 0.2 million Swiss francs on buying hotel furniture from the St. Moritzer Bank. Johann Stoppany himself invested 148,000 Swiss francs in 296 shares of the new company, which fell just 4 shares below 50% of its issued share capital.Statuten der A.-G. Hotel Pontresina p. 4., verwahrt in der Dokumentensammlung Sporthotel Pontresina im Schweizerischen Wirtschaftsarchiv (SWA) in Basel, Signatur H + I E 65. However, the company register discloses that his siblings and other relatives were included among his fellow shareholders. Nevertheless, the new hotel director, Hans Beck, who took over in 1911, was the first director since before 1881 not to be a member of the Stoppany clan.  World War I (1914-1918) The outbreak of war at the end of July 1914 abruptly ended Pontresina's hotel boom. Despite Switzerland's political and military neutrality, the country was greatly impacted by the war, especially in respect of those industries, such as high- end tourism, most of whose customers came from countries, such as Germany and England, that were among the leading belligerent powers. The supply of hotel guests dried up and it quickly became clear that the financial survival of Pontresina's hotels was threatened not simply because of the high proportion of running costs that were fixed costs (incurred regardless of occupancy levels), but also because of indebtedness left over from the boom years, as loans fell due for repayment and interest on outstanding balances remained payable. One rapid response, in December 1914, was the creation by the Cantonal government of the Graub√ºnden Credit Co-operative (B√ºndner Kreditgenossenschaft), with the objective of preserving intrinsically viable enterprises and minimizing losses of value (\\"zur Durchhaltung lebensf√§higer Unternehmungen und zur Verhinderung des Untergangs bedeutender Werte\\").Daniela Decurtins, Susi Grossmann: Auf Gedeih und Verderb. Schweizerische Bankgesellschaft Chur 1994 p. 56. The Credit Co-operative's own capital was subscribed by the local communities affected and banks as well as the hotel businesses themselves and their suppliers. By providing additional subordinated mortgage loans they were able to provide vital additional working capital. Records of subsequent conversion of mortgage loans into share capital show that the Hotel Pontresina was one of the institutions to benefit from these emergency measures. Support for the hotels sector also came from the federal government, which on 2 November 1915 enacted a so-called \\"Decree concerning the Protection of the Hotels Industry from the Consequences of the War\\" (\\"Verordnung betreffend Schutz der Hotelindustrie gegen die Folgen des Krieges\\"). This involved a wide-ranging deferral of loan interest and capital repayment, and protection of hotels from foreclosure. However, it also included, in ¬ß 27 on obligation clase which became known as the \\"Hotels Building prohibition\\", which under most circumstances prohibited both the construction of new hotel buildings and the conversion for use as hotels of existing commercial premises.Verordnung betreffend Schutz der Hotelindustrie gegen die Folgen des Krieges vom 2. November 1915, Artikel 27. Guest lists from the war years make clear the difficulties involved in trying to replace all the foreign guests who were staying away with Swiss guests. Even for the summer season Swiss customers tended to prefer the more competitively priced second and third rank hotels over the luxury establishments such as the Hotel Pontresina,Eugen B√∂hler: Gutachten √ºber die wirtschaftliche Lage der Schweizer Hotellerie. Verlag Schweizer Hotelierverein, Basel 1940, pp. 15 & 27. while for the winter seasons during the war years the Pontresina simply remained shut.  Postwar austerity (1918-1933) The outbreak of peace brought no dramatic upturn in the hotel's fortunes, and it again remained closed for the 1918/19 winter season. Switzerland was infected by the general European inflation that followed the deficit funding of the war, and the prices surge had an adverse impact on the economic costs of running a business.B√ºndnerischer Hotelier-Verein: 1918‚àí1968. Jubil√§ums-Bericht des B√ºndnerischen Hotelier-Vereins. p. 13. There was no return to the freedom of travel that people had been able to take for granted before 1914. In 1911 the Baedeker Guide to Switzerland had advised travelers that they would only need a passport when collecting a registered letter, or when hiking in areas close to the frontiers with France or Italy.Karl Baedeker: Die Schweiz nebst den angrenzenden Teilen von Oberitalien, Savoyen und Tirol. Handbuch f√ºr Reisende. Baedeker, Leipzig 1911, p. VI. After the war travellers to Switzerland from abroad needed not merely a passport but also a visa. The struggle against visa requirements and visa fees became an enduring priority for the \\"Schweizerische Hotelierverein\\" (\\"Swiss Hoteliers' Association\\") and for its 1918 successor organisation, the \\"B√ºndner Hotelierverein\\". The Hotel Pontresina had traditionally been particularly focused on guests from Germany and it was the German economy that suffered more than most in the aftermath of war. German Hyperinflation of the early 1920s made Switzerland particularly expensive for Germans, and it was particularly destructive of the economic security of the high spending upper middle classes who had provided most of the German clientele for the Hotel Pontresina before 1914. On 18 December 1920 the government renewed the \\"Decree [to protect] ... the Hotels Industry from the Consequences of the War\\", which it had originally promulgated as an emergency wartime measure. The qualified debt moratorium was thereby sustained, along with the ban on new hotel building which was strictly enforced. In the end, as demand for hotel accommodation showed no sign of returning to prewar levels, a ban on new hotels and on expansion of existing hotels found its way into the standard legal code, with a statute ratified on 16 October 1924, and effective from 1 January 1926. In the meantime the \\"Schweizerische Hotel-Treuhand- Gesellschaft\\", established in 1921, in some respects took over where the Graub√ºnden Credit Co-operative left off, providing low interest credit to hotels for renovation and modernisation of existing facilities, notably in response to increased customer expectations regarding bathroom and toilet facilities. From 1924 guest numbers finally began a slow recovery, benefitting most of the region's hotels, including the Hotel Pontresina. Brochures of the time indicate that management took the opportunity to resume renovations, notably of the public rooms on the ground floor. There is evidence for a growth in popularity with holidaymakers during the 1920s of recreational swimming and bathing,Eugen B√∂hler: Gutachten √ºber die wirtschaftliche Lage der Schweizer Hotellerie. Verlag Schweizer Hotelierverein, Basel 1940, S. 11. and bathing facilities were made available at Lake Staz and in the surrounding woodlands (\\"Stazerwald\\") between Pontresina and St. Moritz. Despite bitter resistance from some of the canton's more conservative elements, the ban on private motor car usage was grudgingly lifted in the mid 1920s, after which the more prosperous guests, for whom the hotel had been built, increasingly arrived in their own cars. The cantonal ban on private cars had been in force since 1911, at which time car ownership had been limited to a tiny pioneering elite of motoring enthusiasts. It was only during the 1920s that in Germany and Switzerland car ownership accelerated significantly if still, at this stage, rather gently. By this time the tourist industry, including the Hoteliers Association, was lobbying with increasing urgency for the lifting of the ban, but it was not till the tenth referendum on the subject, on 21 June 1921, that the roads of Graub√ºnden were finally opened to private motorists.Daniel Kessler: Hotels und D√∂rfer. Oberengadiner Hotellerie und Bev√∂lkerung in der Zwischenkriegszeit. Selbstverlag, Bern 1998, p. 48. The 1929 Wall Street Crash ushered in more years of exacerbated financial hardship across Europe. Germany introduced foreign currency restrictions on its citizens, while both Germany and Great Britain abandoned the Gold Standard in the late summer of 1931. The Swiss franc soared in value against the currencies in which most of the Hotel Pontresina's guests received their incomes: visitor numbers collapsed correspondingly. Financial restructuring (1933) Hotel Pontresina: Balance sheet and 12 month income statement summary During the twelve months ending 31 March 1933 the accumulated losses of \\"A.-G. Hotel Pontresina\\" rose from 146,782 to 234,357 Swiss francs. Accumulated losses now represented more than 80% of the nominal share capital value which had remained at 300,000 Swiss francs since the company had been set up in 1933. Although the income statement for the twelve months ending 31 March 1933 disclosed a significant operating loss, the larger loss was a financial one, in the form of 74,345 Swiss francs of interest expense. Financial restructuring was unavoidable. The annual general meeting on 5 July 1933 approved a write down of the nominal share capital to 20% of its former value. Investors agreed to exchange five old shares for one new share, still with a nominal value of 500 Swiss francs. New shares with a total value of 40,000 Swiss francs were issued to the cantonal bank in respect of the company's outstanding mortgage debt (which included both a capital element and unpaid interest). The bank agreed to write off 17,800 Swiss francs, and to waive interest for five years on the remaining 35,000 Swiss francs of the mortgage.Kursblatt der B√ºndner B√∂rse, 9 September 1933. The practical outcome of the restructuring was that the bank now owned the hotel, holding 114 of the 200 shares that remained following completion of the restructuring. A further 62 of the shares were held by the Cantonal Credit Institution (\\"B√ºndner Kreditgenossenschaft\\"), which had itself been in receivership since 1931, and which later during 1933 itself fell into the hands of the Graub√ºndner Kantonalbank.Aktion√§rsverzeichnis (shareholder listing) 1933, verwahrt in der Dokumentensammlung Sporthotel Pontresina im Schweizerischen Wirtschaftsarchiv (SWA) in Basel, Signatur H + I E 65. More financial restructuring and another name change (1934-1939) In March 1934, at the end of the next financial year, Hans Beck retired as hotel director after 23 years, to be succeeded by Hans and Mary Walther. With the German economy beginning to benefit from a cyclical upswing, supported by an ongoing programme of Keynesian stimulus, the Hotel Pontresina found itself operating in a financial environment that was a little more friendly. For the first time in many years, the hotel opened for a winter season in 1934/35. However, the annual report for that year included the observation that during the many years when the Pontresina had remained closed through the winter guests had learned to take their winter holidays in competitor establishments, and the much resulting loss in business must be judged permanent.Gesch√§ftsbericht 1934/35, verwahrt in der Dokumentensammlung Sporthotel Pontresina im Schweizerischen Wirtschaftsarchiv (SWA) in Basel, Signatur H + I E 65. The interest burden on what was now 1.3 million Swiss francs of mortgage debt remained oppressive, taking more than 40,000 Swiss francs out of the business each year. By the end of the 1935/36 financial year the company had again eten through its share capital.Gesch√§ftsbericht 1935/1936, verwahrt in der Dokumentensammlung Sporthotel Pontresina im Schweizerischen Wirtschaftsarchiv (SWA) in Basel, Signatur H + I E 65. At a General Meeting on 21 October 1936 the controlling shareholder - still the Graub√ºndner Kantonalbank - again accepted a write down the nominal value of the share capital by 80%. The new share capital of 100,000 Swiss francs was provided from a further conversion of mortgage debt (also held by the bank). This second restructuring effectively wiped out the last of the minority share holders, who were left only with Genussscheine (\\"participation certificates\\"), while the bank owned all the voting shares apart from the few qualifying shares legally required to be held by board members. The General Meeting also decided to recognise the changed ownership structure with a name change for the hotel which now became the \\"Sporthotel Pontresina\\".Die Publikation der Namens√§nderung und der Statutenrevision erfolgte im Schweizerischen Handelsamtsblatt (SHAB), 12 November 1936, Nr. 129, p. 2660. The new name also provided an eloquent statement of where the hotel would be looking for its clients in the future. Newspaper reports of a children's polio epidemic during the summer of 1936 effectively wiped out the summer season for the tourist businesses in and beyond Graub√ºnden. However, the authorities finally devalued the Swiss franc on 26 September 1936 which opened the way for a recovery in tourist numbers.B√ºndnerischer Hotelier-Verein (Hrsg.):1918‚àí1968. Jubil√§umsbericht des B√ºndnerischen Hotelier-Vereins. p. 19-24, 33 The Sporthotel Pontestrina profited from the upswing, and at least for the 1937/38 summer and winter seasons, reported an operating profit. World War II (1939-1945) and aftermath As far as Britain and Germany were concerned, war resumed in September 1939. Switzerland, as in 1914, was politically and militarily neutral, but the countries supplying most of the Hotel Pontresina's guests were not. The Swiss frontiers were closed to holiday traffic in September 1939. Swiss vacationers were no longer able to holiday abroad, and a few of them occupied the hotel rooms that had been emptied by the war, but these, even when supplemented by the use of the hotel for military accommodation, were insufficient, and it proved impossible to keep the hotel open during the winter seasons. Food and fuel were rationed, adding to management difficulties. Only in 1948, three years after the formal end of the war, was rationing of basic consumer goods ended. By this time, just in time for the first post war summer season in 1946, Roman und Marlies Th√∂ndury had taken over at the Sporthotel Pontresina, while their predecessors since 1934, Hans und Mary Walther, had been headhunted (by the Graub√ºndner Kantonalbank which controlled both establishments) to take charge of relaunching Pontresina's \\"Palace Hotel\\", where their grandson and his wife still (2015) run what has subsequently been renamed as the \\"Hotel Walther\\". During the late 1940s the presence across the border in southern Germany of large numbers of US military personnel, with disposal incomes useful higher than those available to the European populations, provided the hotels in the Engadin with a welcome additional customer base, but numbers were insufficient to avert a continuation of the Sporthotel's operating losses. Meanwhile, Swiss holidaymakers were again able to take holidays beyond the country's frontiers, although in practice vacationing possibilities in neighbouring countries, devastated as never before by the impact of industrial warfare, were limited. The widely lauded generosity of the US Marshall Plan dealt a significant blow to the hotel trade in Switzerland by enabling the alpine resorts in neighbouring Austria to rebuild and construct a new generation of hotels, benefitting from generous credit terms not made available in Switzerland, and designed from the start to accommodate a set of operational cost structures and customer preferences that had shifted significantly since the great heyday of Swiss hotel building, during the first fourteen years of the twentieth century. During the 1920s and 1930s the generally lean state of European economies had starved Swiss hotels of funds for investment in modernisation. Around 1950 the shattered economies of western Europe belatedly began to revert to a growth pattern, but where overseas holiday makers felt able to contemplate an alpine holiday, Austrian resorts often presented a more appropriate and less expensive offering than those in Switzerland. The relative strength of the Swiss currency against the German Mark and, especially following a devaluation in September 1949, the British Pound (which still affected several important \\"Sterling bloc\\" currency zones in addition to Britain itself), left the Swiss resorts looking even more expensive from the perspective of what had previously been identified by management as key foreign markets.Gesch√§ftsbericht des B√ºndner Hotelier-Vereins, 1949. From 1950 intensified pressures also began to emerge, slowly, on the cost front as seasonal hotel workers, traditionally recruited inexpensively from, in particular, Italy, began to find opportunities for more attractively remunerated hotel work at home. During the winter season of 1953/54, the Sporthotel stayed shut, citing staff shortages.Gesch√§ftsbericht des B√ºndner Hotelier-Vereins, 1950. Meanwhile, a boom in hotel building in Italy and Spain also encouraged clients whose parents might have chosen an Alpine holiday back in the 1930s to opt, instead, for a more competitively priced Mediterranean beach holiday in the later 1950s. The ban on building additional hotel accommodation, introduced from Bern in 1915 as an emergency response to overcapacity created by the pre-1914 building boom, continued in force in a succession of modified forms for more than three decades, but a further extension of it was rejected by national referendum on 2 March 1952, after which it was finally lifted. Although it was the national decision that the legislators were required to respect, within the canton of Graub√ºnden a large majority of participating citizens had actually voted to perpetuate the ban further, presumably reflecting concerns over possible adverse economic consequences locally of a renewed increase in hotel beds nationally. Bank exit and hotel rebirth (1963-1971) In 1963, finally, the Cantonal Bank decided that the Sporthotel had no longterm commercial future, and \\"Sporthotel Pontresina AG\\" was placed in liquidation.Publikation der L√∂schung nach vollendeter Liquidation im Schweizerischen Handelsamtsblatt 8 May 1964, Nr. 129, p. 1776. On 17 August 1963 the cantonal land registry recorded a change in ownership in respect of the hotel building.Graub√ºndner Kantonalbank: 93. Jahresbericht 1963. Graub√ºndner Kantonalbank, Chur 1964, p. 27. The next year a new owner invested new money in a major renovation exercise. The 1913 central heating installation was replaced in 1965. The south wing, the oldest part of the hotel, was extensively reconfigured and the number of guest rooms was reduced through the substitution on the first and second floors of two large apartments.Graub√ºndner Kantonalbank: 95. Jahresbericht 1965. Graub√ºndner Kantonalbank, Chur 1966, p. 20. Further upgrades took place in 1967, with an increase in the number of guest rooms permanently incorporating their own en suite bathroom facilities.Graub√ºndner Kantonalbank: 97. Jahresbericht 1967. Graub√ºndner Kantonalbank, Chur 1968, p. 22. The large retail space at the southern end of the front facade, which had for some decades accommodated a branch of the Graub√ºndner Kantonalbank, was rebuilt as a sports goods shop using a plan by the architect Otto Kober,Pl√§ne verwahrt im Kulturarchiv Oberengadin, Signatur ID-100697. opening in 1971, while the bank branch had already been relocated, in 1970, to a newly constructed extension attached to the \\"Hotel Schweizerhof\\".Graub√ºndner Kantonalbank: 100. Jahresbericht 1970. Graub√ºndner Kantonalbank, Chur 1971, p. 27/28. Modern times (1972-date) In 1972 the Cantonal Bank cut residual commercial ties with the Sporthotel which was sold to the Pontresina municipality. Restoration work continued, focusing in 1973 on a major reconstruction of the north wing. At the end of the 1973 summer season the directorship of Roman und Marlies Th√∂ndury came to an end, after more than a quarter century. Their successors, Ralph und Monika Schweizer, remained in post between 1973 and 1980. During this period, in 1974, the Swiss Hoteliers Association selected the Sporthotel Pontresina as its first \\"training hotel\\" (\\"Schulungshotel\\"). This means that twice each year, always during the spring and autumn off-peak season, the hotel is used for five week blocks of study during which aspiring hotel professionals receive a combination of theoretical and hands-on training, based on rules set down by the Swiss Ministry for Economics (Staatssekretariat f√ºr Wirtschaft / Secr√©tariat d‚ÄôEtat √† l‚Äô√©conomie / SECO), applying real-life conditions, managed by the trainees themselves. The original driving force behind the initiative was the Graub√ºnden branch of the Swiss Hoteliers Association, but the idea has taken hold and today the Sporthotel Pontresina is one of four hotels in Switzerland used for these off-peak block training courses. The others are in Interlaken (BE) and Les Diablerets (VD).

Electricity consumption was 3.57 TWh. Most of this primary energy (about 80%) represents solid biofuels used in the residential sector (for heating, cooking etc.). About 23% of the electricity is imported, with the rest almost completely supplied by hydroelectricity. Nepal has no known major oil, gas, or coal reserves, and its position in the Himalayas makes it hard to reach remote communities. Consequently, most Nepali citizens have historically met their energy needs with biomass, human labor, imported kerosene, and/or traditional vertical axis water mills. Energy consumption per capita is thus low, at one-third the average for Asia as a whole and less than one-fifth of the world average. The country has considerable hydroelectricity potential. The commercially viable potential is estimated at about 44 GW from 66 hydropower sites. In 2010, the electrification rate was only 53% (leaving 12.5 million people without electricity) and 76% depended on wood for cooking. With about 1 toe for every $1,000 of GDP, Nepal has the poorest energy intensity among all south Asian countries. The country has therefore very large energy efficiency potential. Oil products Petroleum is the second largest energy fuel in Nepal after firewood and accounts for 11% of primary energy consumption in the country. All petroleum products are imported from India. At the moment, the import of petroleum products is transacted exclusively between the Nepal Oil Corporation and the Indian Oil Corporation. 75% of the imports are diesel, kerosene and gasoline. Due to the high energy demand in the country, the dependence on petroleum imports is increasing. More than 62% of the petroleum products are used in the transportation sector. Besides that, petroleum products constitute important energy sources for cooking purposes in households. Biomass Biomass is by far the most important primary energy source in Nepal. Biomass comprises wood, agricultural residues and dung. One major defect with this is that burning these biomass substances for cooking is a common practice (87.3%) and thus exposing many those living in the house to harmful air pollutants.Ranabhat Chhabi Lal et al., \\"Consequence of indoor air pollution in rural area of Nepal: a simplified measurement approach,\\" Frontiers in Public Health 3 (2015), https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2015.00005. Those who cook and live a substantial amount of time in the household (women and children) are exposed to these pollutants and at high risks of acute respiratory infection. In addition, the burning of these biomass fuels often pollutes large quantities of greenhouse gasses (GHGs) into the outside air. One study in a mountain village of Nepal showed that carbon emissions from traditional cooking methods were 8055.47 kg per capita/year.Suwal Rajani and Bajracharya Siddhartha Bajra, \\"Assessment of Current Energy Consumption Practices, Carbon Emissions and Indoor Air Pollution in Samagaun, Manaslu Conservation Area, Nepal,\\" Journal of Natural Resources and Development 6 (2016), https://doi.org/10.5027/jnrd.v6i0.07. Biogas Farming system in Nepal is heavily dependent on livestock, with at least 1.2 million households owning cattle and buffalo. The technical biogas potential is therefore high and is estimated to be at least one million household-size plants, 57 percent located in the Terai plains, 37 percent in the hills and 6 percent in remote hills. According to Nepal's Alternative Energy Promotion Centre, as of July 2011, 241,920 biogas plants were installed in more than 2,800 Village Development Committees and in all 75 Districts under their Biogas Support Program. Biogas takes advantage of a process called anaerobic digestion, where microorganisms break down organic matter into methane and carbon dioxide without oxygen.David Fulford, Small-scale rural biogas programmes a handbook (Rugby, England]: Rugby, England : Practical Action Publishing, 2015) A positive byproduct of biogas is that excess wastes produced by the system can be used as organic fertilizer.Ibid. Biogas as an alternative energy source helps reduce dependence on low grade energy sources (biomass) which pose significant health risks and contribute to GHG emissions. Barriers that Nepalese have reported facing in relation to biogas implementation include the large upfront capital costs, inability of traditional biogas systems to operate in cold and mountainous climates, and isolation of villages making installation logistics more difficult.Gloria V. Rupf et al., \\"Barriers and opportunities of biogas dissemination in Sub-Saharan Africa and lessons learned from Rwanda, Tanzania, China, India, and Nepal,\\" Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews 52, no. C (2015), https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2015.07.107.  Renewable energy  Renewable energy in Nepal comes from hydropower, solar energy, biomass, biogas, and wind energy. Nepal installed hydropower capacity is at 1,016 megawatts (MW), providing most of the country's grid-connected electricity generation. The potential for economically viable hydropower in Nepal is estimated at 40,000 MW.

Mounted specimen Description Crabro cribrarius can reach a body length of (females) or (males). These wasps have a black and yellow body. Males are characterized by conspicuous trowel-like dilatations or fore-tibial shield- like structures used in burrow excavation. The antennae are filiform, with expanded central articles. Tibiae are yellowish-brown and lightly mottled.Baron Cuvier The animal kingdom, arranged according to its organizationBWARS Biology The adults of these solitary wasps feed on nectar of various of umbellifers (Apiaceae), mainly on Angelica sylvestris, Pastinaca sativa, Heracleum and Daucus carota. They also visit Cirsium arvense. These wasps apparently are single-brooded and fly from early June to early September. They build their nests 15 to 20 centimeters deep in sandy or loamy soil, sometimes in rotten wood. At the end of the burrow they construct one-three cells. Each cell is supplied with five to eight medium preys. Females provisions her larvae with paralysed Pyralis and Diptera of various families (Anthomyiidae, Therevidae, Asilidae, Calliphoridae, Empididae, Syrphidae, Tabanidae). Distribution This species is present in most of Europe and east across the Palearctic to Korea.Fauna europaea Habitat These digger wasps colonize dry sandy areas, lowland heaths and coastal dunes, but the can also be found in urban areas, in spruce forest edges, chalk grassland and open woodlands.

History=Backgrounds Accompanied by the rapid development of internet networks around the world, the idea of creating electronic journals bore fruit instantly, so that 110 titles of electronic publications and newsletters in 1991 increased to 1689 titles in 1996 and over 4070 titles in 1997, according to the statistics released by Association of Research Libraries (ARL). On these lines publications and websites providing articles took different approaches to present their publications on the Internet. Some websites attempted to offer references of articles, some published digital texts of articles, some others offered images taken from physical copies of journals instead of textual files and others, like Noor Specialized Magazines Website (Noormags) as the first website working with this method, presented journals in full text and full image. Inception Noor Specialized Magazines Website (Noormags) is a website affiliated to the Computer Research Center of Islamic Sciences (CRCIS). As the largest Islamic bank of specialized journals concerning Islamic sciences, social sciences and the humanities in cyberspace, Noormags was founded in September 2005 with the aim of facilitating and promoting research and producing knowledge. Its user interface has been so far updated several times to keep pace with new technologies. The basic idea of establishing the website originated from the successful experience of presenting religious journals in Hawzah website. The increasing enthusiasm expressed by users and the experts‚Äô growing need to new capabilities led the CRCIS to launch Noormags to meet their needs. Summary of activities 2003: Performing the feasibility study and website analysis phases 2004: Designing and implementing the website 2005: Official opening of the website 2012: Launching version 1.5 2014: Launching version 2 The Website Objectives Creating the broadest and most comprehensive archive of journals and articles on Islamic sciences, social sciences and the humanities on the Internet is one of the main objectives for setting up such a website. Allowing researchers to have a quick and easy access to research resources, disseminating scientific information as well as accelerating scientific researches and preventing parallel researches are among other objectives of the website. Content The journals on the website are categorized into twenty one subjects: social sciences, law, history, geography, economy, language and literature, political sciences, management, psychology, library and information sciences, art and architecture, philosophy and theology, the Qur'an and Hadith, Fiqh and usoul (Islamic jurisprudence and its principles), physical education, ethics, religions, educational sciences, accounting, health and interdisciplinary. The articles available on the website can be downloaded in both HTML and PDF formats in full text and full image. Services and features Graphical and visual features of this website have undergone a lot of changes and improvements during the course of its activity. In addition, a lot of unique services and technical capabilities have been offered to users with versions 1.5 and 2. Changes in version 1.5 ‚Ä¢ Search and information retrieval: The most important change in this version occurred in the search section. Searching in titles of journals, articles of a specific journal and articles of a specific author, searching in the texts of articles, increased search filters and standard search simultaneously in articles and journals were new changes introduced in this version. ‚Ä¢ Extracting and providing citation files of articles: In this version, users were provided with citation files of articles in three standard formats as RIS, EndNote and BibTex. ‚Ä¢ Providing a brief statistics of articles by a specific author: Statistical categorization of articles by authors was made available to users. ‚Ä¢ Display of journals based on scientific rank and language: This feature helps researchers to learn about journals and their scientific ranks and therefore to make a more accurate selection of the required sources and materials. ‚Ä¢ Using front cover image for journal icons: front cover image was displayed as journal icons in Publication Info page, Article View page and the lists. Changes in version 2A.AutomationSmart detection of related articles based on users‚Äô visits From the advent of this Website, many users have viewed and received these articles. Those who follow a particular topic in the website adopt various ways to search for it. The website can track the articles that a user views in one research task. If the number of times two articles are viewed at the same time is considerably large, it can be concluded that they are related to each other. This capability uses this method to let the user know about other articles that may be in some way related to the current one. Smart detection of titles similar to that of the current article from among a huge mass of articles This is a smart tool to discover the articles having titles most similar to that of the current article, taking advantage of text mining and artificial intelligence methods. Finding related articles is a research concern that must be answered in the shortest time available in order for the researchers to organize comprehensive and non- repetitive research works. The main way to know the relationship of articles with each other is to check the common words in their titles. This tool uses the titles of articles to identify their relationship with one another. Noormags exclusive search engine A part of developing Noor local search engine has been embedded in the new Noormags website. Here are some features of the search engine: ‚Ä¢ Searching for all word forms: all derivations of the search word are included in search results. ‚Ä¢ Highlighting search results: the search results will be displayed highlighted through the texts. ‚Ä¢ Find synonyms: synonyms of the search word will be included in search results. ‚Ä¢ Spell checker: it checks the words typed onto the search input line and suggests their correct spelling if mistyped.

He is best remembered as a co-founder and first Principal of the University of Stirling, and founder of the Macrobert Arts Centre in Stirling. He wrote several popular academic textbooks on the subject of chemistry. Life He was born in Edinburgh on 8 June 1923, the son of Lily and Allin Cottrell, a lecturer in chemistry at the University of Edinburgh. He attended George Watson‚Äôs College and then studied chemistry at the University of Edinburgh, graduating with a B.Sc. in 1943. From 1943 he worked at the Nobel Division of ICI, based at Ardeer working on the manufacture of explosives. He worked here until 1959. In 1952 he was awarded the Meldola Medal by the Institute of Chemistry. From 1959 until 1965 he was Professor of Chemistry at the University of Edinburgh. Following the award of a D.Sc. from the University in 1958, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1960, his proposers including James Kendall and Mowbray Ritchie. From 1965 he became involved in the creation of the University of Stirling both physically and in terms of creating its administrative structure. The University was sited in open countryside, just north of Stirling, and was one of the wave of purpose-built modern universities being created across Britain in the late 20th century. It centred on Airthrey Castle but this was too small to serve as much more than simply a focal point within the University. Cottrell‚Äôs office in these years was in the Garden Cottage of the castle‚Äôs estate. He was also an enthusiastic sailor, racing a Dragon Class yacht (Vodka) on the Firth of Forth at Granton at the Royal Forth Yacht Club, and later (Cressid) on the Clyde. In 1967, on completion of the essential core buildings of the university, he became the first Principal and Vice-Chancellor of the University of Stirling and immediately began promoting the arts at the University. This included the creation of the highly forward-looking Macrobert Arts Centre, on the east side of the University campus. Outside his academic interests, Cottrell was a appreciator of fine art and established a substantial collection of Scottish art for the University, beginning with the acquisition of 14 paintings by John Duncan Fergusson from his widow, Margaret Morris. The collection expanded to include works by John Bellany, Anne Redpath, Joan Eardley, Elizabeth Blackadder, Eduardo Paolozzi. He died of a heart attack, at home in Stirling on 2 June 1973, aged 49.The Times: obituaries, 4 June 1973 Publications *The Strengths of Chemical Bonds (1958) *Molecular Energy Transfer in Gases (1961) *Chemistry (1963) *Dynamic Aspects of Molecular Energy States (1965) Family He married Marie Findlay (1924-2014) in 1950 and had two sons, Allin and John.

He was a founder of a local co-operative house painters' society, and took various posts in the movement, becoming secretary of the Co-operative Union's south west region, and serving on its central board and various national committees. He was president of the Co-operative Congress in 1910 and of the Plymouth Co- operative Society from 1914 to 1919. A strong advocate of the movement involving itself in politics, he was the first chairman of the Co-operative Party, serving until his death. Watkins also served on the Consumer Council, and from 1919 until his death was a Labour Party member of Plymouth City Council.

The band consists of Cory Hanson (vocals, guitar), Sofia Arreguin (synth, vocals), Robert Cody (guitar), Lee Landey (bass) and Evan Burrows (drums). Since their formation, the band has released five albums in five years: Ganglion Reef (2014), Golem (2015), 1000 Days (2015), Plum (2017) and Laughing Matter (2019). History=Formation and Ganglion Reef (2013‚Äì2014) Prior to forming Wand, vocalist and guitarist Cory Hanson performed under the moniker W.H.I.T.E. Hanson also played guitar with Mikal Cronin, and in the bands together PANGEA, and Meatbodies. Working on the songs that would become the band's debut album, Ganglion Reef, Hanson subsequently re-recorded his material after forming Wand with former art school classmates Lee Landey and Evan Burrows: \\"[I] found a band, and we re-recorded everything and then just started playing... really intensely.‚Äù Regarding the band's name, Hanson noted: \\"We wanted a name that was kind of empty, like a wand is more of an idea, like a magical tool; it‚Äôs a means, a vessel to execute a superhuman thing.\\" Wand released the album on fellow-garage rock act Ty Segall's Drag City imprint, God? Records, and subsequently supported him on tour. Regarding the experience, Hanson stated: \\"[The tour] was great, it was a little bit crazy for us because we‚Äôve never toured before. And the turnout‚Äîit was just a lot of people, and we were all surprised by how warmly received, how receptive everyone was to hearing us play because no one had ever heard us before. And Ty‚Äôs super fun to tour with.\\" Golem and 1000 Days (2015‚Äì2016) The band quickly recorded its second studio album, Golem, with producer and engineer Chris Woodhouse, best known for his work with the garage rock act, Thee Oh Sees. The album was recorded in twelve days, with Hanson stating: \\"I went in thinking, 'Oh, this is going to be a really grimy, disgusting record with these really fucked-up guitars.' And then Chris sort of took a different turn, because he just kind of gave it a Big Star treatment. So the production is, like, bizarrely pristine and all of the performances are really fucked and weird.\\" Six months later, the band released its self-produced follow-up, 1000 Days, on Drag City. Prior to the album's recording and release, guitarist Daniel Martens temporarily stepped down from the band, with bass guitarist Lee Landey stating: \\"He's not touring with us this time because he's just had a baby.\\" The band was subsequently referred to as a three-piece, with Martens remaining absent from press photographs. Regarding a potential fourth album, Hanson noted: \\"I think we‚Äôre a little more interested in having some more creative elbow room to push out something that feels like the right next step, rather than having this consistent output of record, tour, record, tour. Having a little bit more time to work could only benefit the way that we think about making records at this point.\\" In 2016, the band added guitarist Robert Cody and keyboardist Sofia Arreguin to their core line-up. Plum and Perfume (2017‚Äì2018) On June 27, 2017, a video for the song \\"Plum\\" was released on the Drag City YouTube channel. A music video for the track \\"Bee Karma\\" was also released on August 10, 2017, directed by Hanson, utilising Super 8 film and starring his brother Casey. The album Plum was subsequently released on September 22, 2017. On February 27, 2018, a day after the band concluded their Plum tour, Cory Hanson announced on his Instagram that Wand would be releasing a thirty-minute EP entitled Perfume on May 25, 2018. A single song, \\"The Gift\\", was released on the day of the announcement. Laughing Matter (2019-present) Wand released their fifth album, Laughing Matter, on April 19, 2019. The album received positive reviews from both Pitchfork and Stereogum.

Life Verstraete was born in Ghent, Belgium, on 5 January 1850. His father and mother moved to Antwerp in 1852. His father was the second conductor of the 'Nationaal Toneel\\" (National Theatre) in Antwerp while his mother, Julie Verstraete-Lacquet, was a popular actress. The family later moved to Brussels.A.W. Sanders van Loo, Kunstkroniek, in: Dietsche Warande en Belfort year 1907, J.-E. Buschmann, Antwerp,1907, p. 171-176 Verstraete initially showed an inclination for music and accompanied his parents on their theatre tours including a trip in 1860 to the Netherlands. He was also keen on drawing. In 1867 he commenced his studies at the Antwerp Academy. In the graphics department, headed by Jozef Bal, Verstraete developed his drawing skills and also learned the etching technique, which he would use throughout his career. Spring in Schoore From 1867 he attended the painting class at the Antwerp Academy, which was headed by Jacob Jacobs. The classmates of Verstraete included Emile Claus, Jef Lambeaux, Edgard Farasyn and Henri Houben. From 1873 to 1878 Verstraete attended the free workshop of Jacob Jacobs, which was linked to the Academy. That year he got married. He relied for his finances on aid from his mother as well as his work as a drummer and decorative painter at the theatre.Theodoor Verstraete at Jan Frans Simons vzw At the time he was living in Brussels. Theodoor Verstraete showed his first canvases at the Antwerp Salon of 1876 or 1877. From that time onwards, he regularly contributed to exhibitions. He achieved his first success in 1882 with his painting Dusk, which was awarded an honorable mention in Paris and a gold medal in Antwerp. In 1878 Verstraete left the Academy and went to work the next year in a picturesque house in Brasschaat, near Antwerp. His house was built in the middle of nature in the Campine region of Belgium. From here he traveled around in his caravan to paint the surrounding landscapes. He only visited his family, presumably still living in Brussels, in the weekends. Verstraete was called the 'painter of Brasschaat' and other painters working with him or receiving training from him were considered to be members of the so-called 'School of Brasschaat' of landscape painting. Jan Frans Simons, Frans Van Ballaer and Jules Guiette were deemed to be members of this school. Evert Pieters and Rosa Leigh are also regarded as pupils of Theodoor Verstraete. Verstraete, c. 1896 In 1883 Verstraete was one of the 20 original members of the group of the 'Les XX' (The Twenty), an association of 20 progressive artists in Brussels. He left the group two years later, probably because of his more conservative style, which was not in line with what the other artists in the group were creating.Dorine Cardyn, 'Schilders in de Kempen rond de school van Kalmthout', in: Vlaanderen. Jaargang 28. Christelijk Vlaams Kunstenaarsverbond, Roeselare 1979, pp. 74‚Äì80 Verstraete was in 1883 a co-founder of the Antwerp group of artists called 'Wees U Zelf' ('Be yourself'). The manifest of the group drafted by Piet Verhaert argued for maintaining the tradition. Other members included Frans Van Kuyck, Eug√®ne Joors, Edgard Farasyn and Emile Claus.'350 jaar Koninklijke Academie voor Schone Kunsten Antwerpen: 1663‚Äì2013'; Contradicties, 2013 Museum, p. 242 Verstraete was in 1891 a co-founder in Antwerp of the artist association 'De XIII', which aimed to liberate art of the reigning academism. It planned to organize annual exhibitions (salons) in Antwerp as well as group exhibitions. During its existence the association, which was disbanded in 1899, organized three salons.Kunstkring XIII ‚Äì Antwerpen (1891‚Äì1899) High Tide The financial situation of Verstraete improved after he was introduced in 1886 to art collector and patron Henri Van Cutsem. Van Cutsem encouraged Verstraete to travel to various places in the Netherlands such as Hansweert, Leiden, Utrecht and Schoore in Zeeland, where he etched and painted. Theodoor Verstraete also spent time in Blankenberge on the Belgian coast where Van Cutsem owned a villa and invited his artist friends to visit. Verstraete was fascinated with the mobile spectacle of water and air near the sea. While the relationship with Van Cutsem resulted in a considerable improvement of Verstraete's finances, he was in 1893 struck by a stroke, which possibly led to blindness and inability to speak. This signaled the end of the artistic career of Verstraete. The destitute Verstraete could thereafter only survive financially through the support of his patron Henri Van Cutsem, who gave him after 1904 a monthly stipend. Van Cutsem also regularly bought from Verstraete paintings, which he later returned to the artist. The retrospective exhibitions of 1895 in Zaal Verlat and in 1906 organized by Kunst van Heden (Art of Today), which also included works by Willem Linnig the Younger, were also a welcome source of income. Death and legacy The Hauler During his last years Theodoor Verstraete continued to suffer from ill health and mental disability. After he died on 8 January 1907 he was interred next to Hendrik Conscience at the honorary park of the Kiel cemetery in Antwerp. On 15 April 1942 his remains were transferred to the honorary park of the Schoonselhof cemetery in Antwerp. In 1909 a statue and monument of Verstraete was erected in the Stadspark ('City park') of Antwerp. It was sculpted and donated by Guillaume Charlier.De Inventaris van het Bouwkundig Erfgoed: Monument Theodoor Verstraete (ID: 300506) Work Theodoor Verstraete painted realist landscapes with figures, village scenes and animal scenes. He initially employed a dull palette but gradually started using brighter tones. Verstraete worked in oils as well as in watercolors and also produced many etchings. His work was influenced by the realism of Jean-Fran√ßois Millet as well as other members of the French Barbizon school. After the Rain Verstraete was part of a group of Belgian painters who took refuge from the complexity of urban life to look for simplicity, purity and naturalness in the pre-industrial countryside. They saw the countryside as a serene world, which stood in sharp contrast to their familiar urban environment. There they looked for quiet and contemplation and identified themselves with the simple villagers. They had a particular fondness for the Campine region, which was relatively isolated and had been untouched by industrialization. Some of these artists, such as Frans Van Leemputten and Verstraete who both worked in the Campine, depicted the rural reality from their own urban background and viewpoint. In his early works created in Brasschaat Theodoor Verstraete was driven by his social consciousness and compassion with the villagers. Verstraete described his works as expressions of his feelings of compassion with, and admiration for, the peasants who had to struggle with the ungrateful earth for their survival. He painted sad impressions of resignedly working, deeply devout peasants in a melancholic environment.Lut Pil, 'Boeren, burgers en buitenlui: voorstellingen van het landelijk leven in Belgi√´ vanaf 1850', Leuven University Press, 1 January 1990, pp. 27‚Äì28 These melancholic early works, such as After the funeral (1876‚Äì1880, Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium), express in their gloomy atmosphere the poverty of the peasants and their submissiveness to the land. The works of this period show subjects that allowed Verstraete to give free rein to his urge for poetic dreaminess and sentimentality. To the Vigil After Verstraete started working in Zeeland in the Netherlands and at the coast during the period from 1886 to 1890, his work lost its earlier gloominess. Rather than evening or winter scenes or impoverished figures, he painted his landscapes and figures in a clear palette, in full sunlight. The totally different atmosphere to a certain extent reflects the differences between the Campine and Zeeland landscapes. The later work of Verstraete abandoned its sentimental touch and gave more objective, neutral depictions of some of the subjects he treated earlier. This is shown in works such as To the vigil (1889‚Äì1890, Royal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp). The composition depicts male and female peasants walking towards a farmhouse to pray for someone who has died there. The dimensions of this painting are particularly large: 172 cm high and 294 cm wide. The subject matter of Verstraete also changed and he started treating more prosaic subjects such as a ship hauler, a peasant couple near the barrier of the barnyard and a gardener crouching near some flower pots.Pol de Mont, 'De schilderkunst in Belgi√´ van 1830 tot 1921', The Hague, Martinus Nijhoff, pp. 101‚Äì102 ReferencesExternal links * People from Ghent Belgian printmakers Belgian genre painters Belgian marine painters Belgian landscape painters 19th-century Belgian painters 1850 births 1907 deaths ","title":"Theodoor Verstraete"},{"id":"48566557","text":"Galagete is a moth genus in the subfamily Autostichinae.funet.fi Species * Galagete cinerea Landry, 2002 * Galagete consimilis Landry, 2002 * Galagete cristobalensis Landry, 2002 * Galagete darwini Landry, 2002 * Galagete espanolaensis Landry, 2002 * Galagete gnathodoxa (Meyrick, 1926) * Galagete griseonana Schmitz & Landry, 2005 * Galagete krameri Landry & Schmitz, 2008 * Galagete levequei Landry, 2002 * Galagete pecki Landry, 2002 * Galagete protozona (Meyrick, 1926) * Galagete seymourensis Landry, 2002 * Galagete turritella Landry, 2002 References Autostichinae ","title":"Galagete"},{"id":"48566565","text":"Ischnodoris is a moth genus in the subfamily Autostichinae.funet.fi Species * Ischnodoris sigalota Meyrick, 1911 * Ischnodoris chlorosperma Meyrick, 1929 References Autostichinae ","title":"Ischnodoris"},{"id":"48566582","text":"SOR BN 9,5 is a model of partly low-floor minibus manufactured by Czech company SOR Libchavy.

Thiruvazhmarban Temple is located about 5 km far, north-easterly to Nagercoil, 20 km far, north-westerly to Kanyakumari and 45 km south-west of Nanguneri Divyadesam. Constructed in the Dravidian style of architecture, the temple is glorified in the Divya Prabandha, the early medieval Tamil canon of the Azhwar saints from the 6th‚Äì9th centuries AD. It is one of the 108 Divyadesam dedicated to Vishnu, who is worshipped as Thiruvazhmarban and his consort Lakshmi as Kamalavalli. The oldest inscription in the temple is from 1139 AD indicating gifts to the temple. A granite wall surrounds the temple, enclosing all its shrines. The temple tank is located opposite to the temple, outside the main entrance. Thiruvazhmarban is believed to have appeared to the Saptarishis, the seven sages, and to Udayanangai, the mother of Nammazhwar. The place is the birthplace of Nammazhwar, one of the twelve Azhwar saints in Vaishnava philosophy. The temple follows Thenkalai tradition of worship. Six daily rituals and many yearly festivals are held at the temple, of which the ten-day Chittirai Brahmotsavam during the Tamil month of Chittirai (April - May), Aadi Swati festival for Kulasekara Azhwar, Navrathri during September - October and Vaikunta Ekadasi during Margazhi (December - January) being the most prominent. The temple is maintained and administered by Kanyakumari Devasthanam. Legend Image of Kulashekhara Alwar As per Hindu legend, Saptarishis, the seven sages of Hindu Mythology are believed to have worshipped Vishnu at this place. Vishnu was pleased by their devotion and appeared at this place. As per another legend, king Kulasekara, who would go on to become Kulashekhara Alwar came to this place after a conquest. His horse was lost and he was in search of the horse. He found that the horse was grazing peacefully on the banks of Soma Theertham, the temple tank. After taking bath in the tank, he felt rejuvanted worshipping the Vishnu temple in the banks. He is believed to have constructed the temple and named the place as Thiruvanparisaram (pari in Tamil indicates horse). Thiru indicates respect, vazh means live and marban indicates the heart of the person. Since Vishnu held his consort in his heart in this place, he is commonly referred Thiruvazhmarban. History The exact history of the temple could not be ascertained from the inscriptions. The oldest inscription is dated from 1139 AD, when a person by name Natesan Chetti from Rajendra Cholapattinam offering donations to the temple. Two other inscriptions from the temple are dated 1613 and 1785 indicating record of offerings to the temple. A local historic account states that famous Nayak king Thirumalai Nayak (1623-59 CE) visited the place and constructed the stepped temple tank. The inscriptions in the temple refer the place is Thiruvanparisaram. Architecture The vimanam of the temple Thiruvazhmarban temple covers an area of about and has a five- tiered gopuram (gateway tower). The temple in enclosed in a rectangular enclosure surrounded by granite walls. The central shrine houses the image of the presiding deity, Thiruvazhmarban in sitting posture. There is no separate shrine for his consort Lakshmi as she is believed to reside in his chest. Surrounding the presiding deity, the images of Saptharishis are present. The images of Rama, Lakshmana and Sita are located to the right of the presiding deity. The image of Thiruvazhmarban is made of a compound of lime and granite. The sanctum also houses the images of Vishwaksenara, Kulasekara Azhwar, Nataraja and Sivakami. The festival deity is made of panchaloha and all the ablution related worship practises are done only for festival deity. The shrines of Garuda, Anjaneya, Ramanuja, Vedanta Desika and Azhwars are found in the second precinct. The temple tank, Soma Theertham is located outside the main shrine. A hall named Kalyana Vimana Mandapa located near the tank houses paintings depicting Dasavatara, the ten avatars of Vishnu. Religious significance Soma Theertham, the temple tank, considered to have curative medicinal powers Thiruvazhmarban temple is revered in Nalayira Divya Prabhandam, the 7th‚Äì9th century Vaishnava canon, by Nammazhwar. The temple is classified as a Divyadesam, one of the 108 Vishnu temples that are mentioned in the book. During the 18th and 19th centuries, the temple finds mention in several works like 108 Tirupathi Anthathi by Divya Kavi Pillai Perumal Aiyangar. As per Hindu legend, Nammazhwar, the most prominent Azhwar saint from the 9th century was born in Thirupathisaram. There are other accounts, which place his birthplace as Thirukurukur (modern day Alwarthirunagiri) in the southernmost region of the Tamil country. Some sources consider his to have been a princely family, although of shudra status. It is believed that he was born fully enlightened as the baby he never cried or suckled and never opened his eyes. The child did not respond to no external stimuli and his parents carried him in a golden cradle from Tirupathisaaram and left him at the feet of the deity of Sri Adhinathar in Alwarthirunagari. The child got up and climbed into a hole in a tamarind tree, sat in a lotus position, and began to meditate. He was in this state for sixteen years when a Tamil poet and scholar, on his trip to North India, named Madhurakavi Alvar saw a bright light shining to the south, and followed it until he reached the tree where the boy was residing. Madhurakavi asked a divine question on existence to the boy for which he responded that if the soul identifies with the body, it will be the body but if it serves the divine, it will stay in vaikunta and think of God. The boy was named Nammazhwar and he went on to recite verses, which were recorded by Madhurakavi and later went on to be compiled as Nalayira Divya Prabhandam along with the works of other Azhwars. Religious practises and festivals The temple follows the traditions of the Thenkalai sect of Vaishnavite tradition and follows Vaikasana aagama. In modern times, the temple priests perform the pooja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. Six daily rituals are held at various times of the day and many yearly festivals are held at the temple, of which the ten-day Chittirai Brahmotsavam during the Tamil month of Chittirai (April - May), Aadi Swati festival for Kulasekara Azhwar when he is believed to attain Vaikunta, Navrathri during September - October and Vaikunta Ekadasi during Margazhi (December - January) being the most prominent. There are weekly, monthly and fortnightly rituals performed in the temple. During the Chittirai Brahmotsavam, the festival deities of the temple are taken around the streets of the temple in a chariot drawn by hundreds of devotees.

In addition to the campus, the district includes a series of relatively high-style Federal and later-period houses along Federal Street and Maine Street, which join the campus to downtown Brunswick. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. Description and history The town of Brunswick was chartered in 1737, and was initially powered economically by mills along the Androscoggin River, and by maritime trade. Bowdoin College was chartered in 1794, and its first buildings constructed on the campus south of the town center in 1799 and 1808. The town's maritime economy was devastated by the Embargo of 1807, and the college assumed a more prominent role. The college campus is joined to the downtown by Maine Street, which runs through downtown Brunswick south, and was the area's first major road (1717), and Federal Street, laid out roughly parallel to the east of Maine Street in 1803. Federal Street rapidly became a fashionable residential area, with high-style houses lining it and adjacent cross streets connecting it to Maine Street. In 1826 a swamp along Maine Street was filled in to form a park bounded on the east by Park Row, which was also developed with high style housing. The college extended the idea of the Park Row mall along the western edge of its campus. The historic district encompasses the traditional heart of the Bowdoin campus, bounded by Maine and College Streets on the west and south, Silas Drive on the East, and Bath Road to the north. It then extends northward along Park Row and Federal Street to School Street, from which it continues north on Federal Street to Mason Street. Most of the buildings in the district are residential, and the most commonly-seen architectural styles are Federal, Greek Revival, and Colonial Revival, although other 19th and early 20th-century revival styles are also represented. Notable non-academic buildings in the district include the prominently-placed First Parish Church of Richard Upjohn, the architecturally significant Gothic Revival Henry Boody House on Maine Street, and the historically significant Parker Cleaveland House (now the official residence of the Bowdoin president) and the Harriet Beecher Stowe House. Campus buildings in the district include Massachusetts Hall, its first building, and the Walker Art Gallery, among others.

After being absent for a year, he made his return on 5 September 2009 at Fear & Loathing 2 in a tag team match with his tag partner Chris Renfrew, which they lost against the team of Lionheart & Red Lightning. A year later at Fear & Loathing 3, BT Gunn picked up his 1st win in ICW, tagging with Jack Jester against James Scott & Wolfgang. On 5 June, BT Gunn defeated Johnny Moss, Liam Thompson and Wolfgang, in a four-way elimination match to win the ICW Heavyweight Championship for the 1st time, which he would hold for 4 months until he lost it to Darkside on the 4 of September.

They unsuccessfully attempted to regain the tag team championship in a three-way ladder match against former champions the Bucky Boys and eventual winners The Sumerian Death Squad. After the tag titles became vacant on 27 July, they would go on to win their second ICW Tag Team Championship, by defeating the team of Stevie Xavier & Kay Lee Ray, who substituted for an injured Davey Blaze. They would lose the belts on the 10 of August, to the team of Colt Cabana & Grado, but would regain the titles 2 weeks later, After feuding with Wolfgang for most of 2014, their rivalry was finally brought to a close on 25 January 2015, when Wolfgang defeated BT in ICW's first ever Steel Cage match. Disappearing for 2 months, BT would return with a much darker persona, labelled 'The Oddity', and turned his attention to Mikey Whiplash, with the pair competing in a number of brutal matches throughout the first half of the year. At Shug's Hoose Party II, BT defeated Whiplash, after Mikey was busted open and powerbombed onto the steel ring steps. Their feud would transform into a rivalry between the New Age Kliq, now including Wolfgang, and Legion (Mikey Whiplash, Tommy End & Michael Dante). This would lead to a 3-on-3 Steel Cage match, at Fear & Loathing VIII at the SEC Centre, with the New Age Kliq coming away with the victory thanks to BT. In early 2016, BT & Chris Renfrew were left as the only remaining members of the New Age Kliq, with Wolfgang, Kay Lee Ray & Stevie Boy defecting from the group. Turning face around the same time and dropping 'The Oddity' persona, BT focused much of his attention on Stevie Boy, with Stevie & BT competing in many singles and tag team matches throughout the year. After Stevie attempted to crush BT's throat with a chair, Gunn was sidelined for 3 months, before returning 'The Oddity' once again to exact revenge. This led to the first ever Casket Match in ICW history, at Fear & Loathing IX at The SSE Hydro, where Stevie would powerbomb Gunn onto the top of the casket, before picking up the victory.

BT would go on to defeat Joe, winning the ICW World Heavyweight Championship for the first time since 2012, and the third time overall, becoming the first ever Undisputed ICW World Champion. After successfully defending the title against Bram & James Storm, BT's rivalry with Mikey Whiplash was re-ignited, with Whiplash claiming that BT had forgotten who he truly is, and demanding to face 'The Oddity' one more time. On 3 April 2018 BT Gunn was forced to vacate the ICW Zero-G Championship due to a double pinfall between Jody Fleisch and Mark Coffey, and interference from Whiplash. On 29 April 2018, at ICW BarraMania 4, 'The Oddity' returned to face Whiplash in the first ever ICW World Heavyweight Championship Death Match. BT would go on to lose the title, after 2018 Square Go winner Stevie Boy cashed in his contract mid-match, turning the contest into a Three Way, and pinned Whiplash, who had been driven through a pane of glass. Having lost both titles without being pinned, BT looked to climb back up the ladder. After facing and defeating Walter at night 1 of Shug's Hoose Party 5, BT's protege Kez Evans attacked him, claiming that BT had done nothing except hold him back. Kez would go on to defeat BT the following night. After briefly reforming the New Age Kliq to challenge the Kings Of Catch, Renfrew left the company, changing BT Gunn's direction and focus.

Her mother is Shirley Phelps-Roper and her grandfather is the church's founder Fred Phelps. She grew up in Topeka, Kansas in a compound with other members of the church. She was taught the Westboro Baptist Church doctrine and at the age of 13, she was baptized as a member of the church. Phelps-Roper participated in the church's protests against homosexuality and other perceived sins. She picketed various events including the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and the funerals of soldiers who died in the War in Afghanistan and the War in Iraq. In 2009 she became an active member on Twitter to preach the church's doctrine. Phelps-Roper began to doubt her beliefs when Twitter users pointed out contradictions in Westboro Baptist Church's doctrine and a nine-person council took over the church's decision- making process. She also disagreed with church elders that pressured her into posting doctored photos of the church picketing events such as the British Royal Wedding and the funeral of Whitney Houston. Phelps-Roper left the church in 2012 after she was unable to reconcile her doubts with her beliefs. Following her departure, Phelps-Roper became a prominent critic of the group's philosophy and practices. She travels around the world to speak about her experience in the church and advocates dialogue between groups with conflicting views. She is a member of Twitter's Trust and Safety Council and works with law enforcement agencies to combat extremist groups. In 2019, she released her memoir Unfollow: A Journey from Hatred to Hope, leaving the Westboro Baptist Church. Biography=Early life Phelps-Roper was born in Topeka, Kansas and as the eldest of nine children to Shirley Phelps-Roper and Brent Roper. Her grandfather is Fred Phelps and she has Scottish ancestry. She was raised in the Westboro Baptist Church and lived in a compound in southwest Topeka that was surrounded by a tall fence and included the church, houses for members, adjoining backyards, a trampoline, running track, playground and swimming pool.Megan Phelps-Roper was raised in the Westboro Baptist Church. The church sign is pictured here. Phelps-Roper's belief system was shaped by the Westboro Baptist Church's interpretation of the Bible. Every Sunday, her family attended her grandfather's service and listened to him preach the church's interpretation of Calvinist doctrine. Church elders reinforced their beliefs and encouraged Phelps-Roper to memorize Bible passages. The Bible was also used to justify the group's protests and provide counter-arguments to people who disagreed with them. Phelps-Roper later stated that the church's strict beliefs were reinforced because \\"as a child, it is physically beaten into you\\" and that she was regularly spanked during her childhood and teenage years. Phelps-Roper was also exposed to pop culture and ideas which contradicted her beliefs while she attended public school. As a child, Phelps-Roper felt happy being close to her extended family members, both in her relationships and her physical proximity to them. She described herself as an obedient child who worked hard to win the approval of her parents. She also felt a sense of purpose and comfort by having a solution to every problem that was supposedly scripturally supported. Her parents forbade her from having romantic relationships with people who were not members of the church. Within the Westboro Baptist Church At age 13, Phelps-Roper was baptized into the Westboro Baptist Church by her grandfather. The ceremony included a profession of faith and becoming a full member of the church. It took place in the compound's swimming pool. In middle school, Phelps-Roper made friends that were not part of the group and participated in extracurricular activities including running track, volleyball and musical theatre. When she was profiled as an adult, she was described as having acquaintances outside of the church, but no real friends. When interviewed in 2013 about future romantic prospects, she stated she did not believe she would get married because of the low number of men in the group who were not related to her. Phelps-Roper graduated from Washburn University and worked at Phelps Chartered, her family's law firm, as a business administrator. She also appeared as a regular guest on a Kansas City morning show, \\"Afentra's Big Fat Morning Buzz\\". In 2011, Phelps-Roper appeared in Louis Theroux‚Äôs documentary America's Most Hated Family in Crisis. One clip includes Phelps-Roper's explanation of her contact with four Dutch filmmakers. After watching the documentary, her father insisted that she block the Dutch filmmakers on Twitter and limit her time on the platform. She complied with these demands to remove her focus on earthly matters. During this time, Phelps-Roper began planning the church's picket schedule after her mother was accused of not following church doctrine. Doubting Westboro Baptist Church doctrine Around the time of her baptism, Phelps-Roper began doubting Westboro Baptist Church's theology because of the friendships she made at her local public school. She started to believe that her fellow students were not evil, as had been preached to her by church elders. She also experienced doubts in 2009 after the death of Britanny Murphy. While her family celebrated the actress‚Äô death, Phelps-Roper felt an emotion closer to sadness. She chose not to release a celebratory post on Twitter, as had been done in the past with other celebrity deaths. As an adult, Phelps-Roper continued doubting the church's doctrine and discovered contradictions within scripture. The first inconsistency was pointed out to her by David Abitbol, a Jewish Twitter user who Phelps-Roper publicly contacted to encourage him to repent of his sins. Phelps-Roper‚Äôs mother was not married to her first son's father when the child was born. This is considered a sin in the Westboro Baptist Church and they believed the appropriate punishment is the death penalty. Church elders stated that Shirley repented for her sins and was forgiven by God and Abitbol pointed out that if Phelps-Roper would not have been able to repent for her sins if she was punished with death. Phelps-Roper decided to stop carrying signs which called for the death penalty for sins, but she also stopped communicating with Abitbol so her beliefs would not be further challenged. Phelps-Roper disagreed with the church's happiness over celebrity deaths and events that seemed tragic to people outside their group. A person using the alias C.G. would discuss tragic events with Phelps-Roper online and asked her to consider the deceased family's response to her church's joy. In 2011, Phelps-Roper burst into tears after seeing a photograph of a malnourished child living through the Somalia famine. Meanwhile, her mother created a blog post that praised God for the drought which Phelps-Roper believed was the incorrect response. Another point of contention for Phelps-Roper was how decision-making within the church changed in 2011. Previously, the church employed a consensus decision-making model and women had influential roles in this process. A council of nine male church elders met separately from other members and decided to make church decisions by themselves. In another instance, a member was asked to leave the church by a majority vote instead of unanimous consent. Phelps-Roper felt both events violated scripture and went against the groups' concept of leadership. Female members were also encouraged to submit to their husbands and fathers and Phelps-Roper was barred from wearing clothing or colorful nail polish that her brother or father considered immodest. She rebelled against these changes because other members were given more leeway in their clothing choices by their fathers or husbands. Phelps-Roper also agreed with Twitter users who claimed that church members committed the sin of bearing false witness. Church members Photoshopped images and falsely claimed that they protested the Royal Wedding in the United Kingdom and Whitney Houston‚Äôs funeral. Phelps-Roper did not want to post these images on her Twitter feed but was pressured to do so by church elders. She believed that if church members lied about these protests, they could also be wrong about their church's doctrine. She began believing that God was not guiding the church and that members were just people trying to interpret God's will. Leaving the Westboro Baptist Church Phelps-Roper considered leaving the church in April 2012 after Blind Pilot played on the radio and she was reminded of her previous conversations with C.G. She disclosed her thoughts to her sister Grace, who convinced her to stay in the group. However, they discussed their theology with each other and continued making plans for leaving the church. Phelps-Roper withdrew from picketing and speaking to reporters, fearing that her doubts would be revealed. Phelps-Roper contemplated staying in the church and pretending to follow their beliefs, but quickly rejected this idea. In November 2012, Grace and Megan's father confronted them about a relationship Grace was having with another church member. During this discussion, Phelps- Roper encouraged her sister to leave the church with her and they announced their intention to their parents. The two sisters stayed one night in Topeka in the basement of a former teacher before moving into their cousin's home in Lawrence, Kansas. They decided to move to South Dakota after visiting the state. During this transition, Phelps-Roper refrained from posting on social media and devoted her time to reading books and thinking about their future. She publicly announced that she has left the church after discovering the church's planned protest of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. She stated that she did not want others to believe that her lack of response to the protest was a tacit agreement to the church‚Äôs actions. Life after leaving Westboro Baptist Church Since leaving, Phelps-Roper has had limited contact with family members that are still part of the Westboro Baptist Church. She stated that she reaches out to her family by sending messages on Twitter but does not receive responses. She also uses Twitter to monitor changes in their beliefs and learn new information about her family's personal lives. Phelps-Roper also leaves cards and notes for her family at their home when she is in Topeka visiting other family members or at speaking engagements. She does these actions to try to convince members to leave the church or soften their rhetoric at protests. She is married to Chad Fjelland, an attorney whom she met through Twitter while advocating for the Westboro Baptist Church. She kept her maiden name to, as she describes, ‚Äúreform the legacy of the name.‚Äù She also has a daughter who was born in 2018. In 2019, Phelps-Roper appeared in Louis Theroux's third documentary about the Westboro Baptist Church Surviving America's Most Hated Family. Theroux tells Phelps- Roper that two of her siblings are engaged to be married, which causes her to be upset. Theroux was criticised for including this footage in the documentary, with one reviewer stating the revelation exploited Phelps-Roper's emotions and was uncomfortable to watch. Phelps-Roper defended Theroux's inclusion of the footage, stating that she wanted her family members to see her unfiltered reaction to this news. In October 2019, Phelps-Roper released a book Unfollow: A Journey from Hatred to Hope, leaving the Westboro Baptist Church. This memoir details her upbringing in the Westboro Baptist Church and her decision to leave her community and family. The book started as an essay she wrote to her husband, detailing her childhood and how the two of them met. She sent the essay to a friend who encouraged her to write the book. Activism=Within Westboro Baptist Church Megan Phelps-Roper protested with the Westboro Baptist, employing similar tactics to church members in this image.Phelps-Roper began participating in the church's protests against homosexuality when she was 5 years old, before she could read the signs she carried. Early pickets took place in Gage Park, Topeka as part of her grandfather‚Äôs campaign to stop homosexuals from allegedly engaging in sexual intercourse at the park. She also protested major historical events like the funeral of Matthew Shepard, the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and the AIDS pandemic. At 19, Phelps-Roper and the church picketed the funerals of deceased soldiers from the War in Afghanistan and the War in Iraq. Before picketing a funeral, the church members would read the soldier's obituary and study pictures of the deceased. She would also picket her public school during lunchtime and local sporting events. Megan Phelps-Roper appeared with her family on the Howard Stern Show, pictured here in 2004.At 11, Phelps-Roper gave her first live interview to radio DJs who called her house, wanting to interview her mother. When interviewers wanted the perspective of a younger member of the church, her mother would often have them interview Phelps-Roper. She gave interviews with local news, documentary filmmakers and national talk shows like The Howard Stern Show. Reporters and documentary filmmakers also came to her home to speak with her and her family. At 13, Phelps-Roper was debating Westboro Baptist Church sceptics in the church‚Äôs chat rooms and was an active member of the church‚Äôs logistical and legal operations. In 2008, Phelps-Roper joined Twitter, but became an active member in 2009 after someone asked if the church was using the service. Phelps-Roper preached the church's doctrine to celebrities and prominent users of the platform. She liked using Twitter because it allowed her to share theology directly to people, instead of through a reporter. She used a softer tone on the platform than she did during interviews because of the 140 character limit to each post and she wanted to avoid ending conversations after insulting the other user or having the conversation side-tracked by angry responses. Her strategy on Twitter was to counter angry responses with Bible verses, pop culture references and emojis. Then, she would engage in civil conversation to understand the other's viewpoint and convince them of her own. She justified this change in tone with the proverb, ‚ÄúBy long forbearing is a prince persuaded, and a soft tongue breaketh the bone.‚Äù In the late 2000s, the church focused on end-of-the-world prophecies. One of the church's predictions was that 144,000 Jewish people would repent for killing Jesus, so church members focused their attention on preaching to Jewish people and finding these repenters. Phelps-Roper sent messages to prominent Jewish Twitter users calling for them to repent and stop their Jewish rituals before they were sent to hell. David Abitbol responded by asking questions about her beliefs and engaging in theological discussions. The two also met at various functions that Abitbol was attending and Phelps- Roper was protesting to exchange gifts. In 2010, Phelps-Roper filed a lawsuit claiming that Nebraska's law against desecrating the American flag infringed on her free speech rights. A federal judge overturned the law, and Phelps- Roper was awarded $8000 for her attorney fees, which was paid by the state of Nebraska. Phelps-Roper and her family created parodies of pop-culture songs to spread the theology of Westboro Baptist Church. One of their most popular parodies was Ever Burn based on the Lady Gaga song Telephone. The parody, sung by Phelps-Roper, changed the lyrics to claim that God will not listen to Lady Gaga's prayers and that she will be sent to hell. Post-Westboro activism After leaving the Westboro Baptist Church, Phelps-Roper reconnected with Abitbol who convinced her to atone for and fix her mistakes in a Jewish concept called tikkun olam. She is now committed to reaching out to people that she affected during her time with the group, including Jewish communities, homosexuals and the families of soldiers. Phelps-Roper travelled around the United States speaking with groups that she previously protested. She spoke at the Jewlicious Festival in Long Beach, California at the invitation of David Abitbol and accepted a one-month engagement with the Jewish community in Montreal in 2013 where she visited religious studies classes at Concordia University and spoke at a Jewish cultural festival. In October 2015 she spoke at the Anti-Defamation League's Youth Leadership Conference. Phelps-Roper appeared in various media formats to promote her new values and beliefs. In January 2017 she presented a TED talk discussing her experiences growing up within the church and her journey towards her decision to leave. In June 2017, she appeared on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast and in 2018 appeared in the first episode of I Love You, America with Sarah Silverman. Phelps-Roper is a member of Twitter's Trust and Safety Council and advocates overcoming disagreements between political and religious groups. She also works with law enforcement agencies to give her perspective on deradicalizing members of extremist organisations. Personal beliefs Phelps-Roper is no longer a practising Christian and she also does not believe in God, remarking on Twitter in 2017, \\"Jesus had some lovely ideas‚Äîbut also others that aren‚Äôt so helpful. I don‚Äôt reject the good because of the bad, or accept the bad because of the good.\\" She believes that the Bible is a document which was written by people who were trying to understand God and how to be good. She also believes that other philosophies were developed by people who were trying to understand similar concepts. She stated that she is a ‚Äúbeliever in humanity‚Äù and in that way still considers herself to be a believer. Phelps- Roper avoids using a \\"cult\\" label in describing the Westboro Baptist Church. She acknowledges that behaviors of the group are cultlike, such as cutting off contact with former members and believing that the end of the world is imminent. However, she notes that some actions do not fulfil the cult paradigm because she was not prevented from leaving the group and her parents helped her pack her belongings when she left the religion. Regarding Twitter, Phelps- Roper encourages the company to remove bots and posts which advocate harm to others. She does not believe the platform is toxic but that some users bring toxicity into Twitter conversations. She wants users to choose who they receive messages from and what posts appear on their feeds. However, she opposes social media companies that block people and remove their ideas from their platform, and she wants companies to hold public debates on controversial ideas so users can learn about them and decide the best arguments and principles for themselves. She also credits the platform with changing her views on the Westboro Baptist Church and allowing her to engage in dialogue with others.

The main building, constructed in 1834, is the only mill built at this site, and the only one to survive (of several built) nearly unaltered in the village. The mill and its surviving dam were listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Description and history The Mill at Freedom Falls is set in the village of Freedom, a rural community in western Waldo County, Maine. It is located south of Pleasant Street and east of Mill Street, on the west bank of Sandy Stream. It is a two-story timber-framed structure, set on a foundation of granite and rubblestone that is open to the stream. Attached to the main structure are a series of gabled and shed-roofed ells. A short way upstream from the mill stands its dam, a concrete and stone structure built about 1829 and rebuilt in 1927. Remnants of a concrete tailrace are visible below the mill.Grassi, Anthony (2011). NRHP nomination for Mill at Freedom Falls; available by request from the Maine Historic Preservation Office The village of Freedom was established in part because of a significant water drop (about ) on Sandy Stream in a relatively short distance, providing an ideal location for early grist- and sawmills. During the 19th century this area supported a number of diverse water-powered operations, all of whose structures have either been demolished or significantly altered. This mill was built in 1834 by John True, owner of another gristmill on the stream, and was also initially used for milling grain. In 1894, with local agriculture in decline, the mill was converted into a turning mill, producing tool handles and other items. A sawmill was built across the stream to cut raw lumber into stock for its operations; this mill, and a building that joined the two by spanning the stream, have not survived. This mill was closed in 1969 and abandoned. It has since been converted into a restaurant, school, and other businesses.

The Independent Garden Center Show (IGC Show) is held every year since 2007 in Chicago, IL, in the United States.  History  The first IGC Show was held on August 21‚Äì23, 2007, at Chicago's Navy Pier. In 2014, the show organizers started hosting the IGC Show at a second location for the industry's Eastern market. In 2014, IGC East convened August 5‚Äì7 at the Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center in National Harbor, MD. In 2015, IGC East relocated to the Baltimore Convention Center in Baltimore, MD. In 2016, the East Coast event relocated to the Valley Forge Casino Resort August 2‚Äì4. It featured a new format targeting the special interests of Eastern IGC retailers with regionally focused keynotes, educational conference sessions, and networking opportunities, including Tuesday evening's concert. IGC Show 2018 reconvened at Chicago's Navy Pier, August 14‚Äì16. In 2019, citing ongoing construction at IGC Show's home for the past 12 years, Navy Pier, the trade show was moved to McCormick Place. IGC Show 2019 was hosted in the new home, the Lakeside Center at McCormick Place, of the independent garden center industry buying and educational event, presenting all the networking opportunities and other features of the show in one central area right on the exhibit hall floor. It was created by husband-and-wife founders and producers Jeff and Cheryl Morey, who are also co-directors of Garden Centers of America (GCA) and publishers of IGC Magazine. The IGC Show is one of the largest trade shows, conferences and networking events for independent garden center owners, managers and buyers. It is geared toward independents only ‚Äî no big-box stores are represented or allowed into the event. It is not open to the consumer public. The IGC Show presents garden center products available at wholesale from around the world. It is a juried show so every exhibiting company has been screened to ensure the products offered for sale are relevant to independent garden centers. IGC retailers have access to over 30 hours of educational sessions at the IGC Retailer Conference, covering topics relevant to IGCs. In addition to the trade show, the IGC Show hosts an educational conference on topics relevant to garden centers, such as customer service, inventory, signage, social media, store design, advertising, and more. Each day before the trade show opens, a keynote speaker, who is a prominent figure in the garden center industry or an expert in business or a related field, starts the day. The IGC Show offers a newly redesigned networking hub, the IGC Networking Lounge, located in the center of the main trade show hall for garden retailers to connect with their peers and charge their portable devices. \\"Shop Talk\\" Retail Discussions, located in the IGC Networking Lounge and facilitated by a moderator, give retailers the opportunity to share their thoughts on a range of garden retailing topics, including marketing strategies, minimum wage increases, and getting younger customers shopping. Garden center retailers express their opinions with their peers during the moderated \\"Shop Talk\\" Retail Discussions in the IGC Networking Lounge on topics relevant to garden retailing. The New Vendor Zone presents garden center buyers, managers, and owners with a sampling of companies that are new to the IGC Show and garden center industry. The New Product Zone features new products and plants submitted by vendors all across the show's exhibit space. A special contest was started in 2017 to award the Best New Product and the Best New Plant featured in this zone. Garden center retailers voted for their favorite products and plants, and the first-place and runner-up products and plants received award ribbons. In 2017, the first place Best New Product award went to Kreative Gardens of Miami, FL; the second place Best New Product award went to Potwheelz Garden Dolly of Gulf Breeze, FL. In 2017, the first place Best New Plant award went to Regal Petticoat Maple from Sester Farms in Gresham, OR; the second place Best New Plant award went to 'Gold Breeze' Zebra Grass from Hortech in Spring Lake, MI. In 2018, the contest was held again, awarding the first place Best New Product honor to TrashCan of Portsmouth, NH; the second place Best New Product award went to Grass Flip Flops of Westlake Village, CA. Also in 2018, the first place Best New Plant award went to Hollywood Hibiscus from J Berry Nursery of Grand Saline, TX; the second place Best New Plant award went to Endless Summer Hydrangeas Summer Crush from Bailey Nurseries of St. Paul, MN. The 2019 first-place award for Best New Product went to the Complete Grow Kits from A Pot for Pot of Oakland, CA; the second-place Best New Product award went to the Fir Needle Products from Bedrock Tree Farm of Wakefield, RI. Also in 2019, the first-place Best New Plant award went to a colorful, showy air plant arrangement composed of Yellow Star, Large Capitata Maroon and Tropiflora from Russell's Bromeliads of Clermont, FL; the second-place Best New Plant award went to the First Editions Iceberg Alley Sageleaf Willow from Bailey of St. Paul, MN. The 2019 show unveiled the IGC Retail Lab, a new 3,500-square-foot retail symposium and interactive design forum, right on the trade show floor, designed to help IGC owners turn their stores into gathering spaces that capitalize on the most popular consumer trends: ReWild, ReJuvenate, ReTreat and ReTurn.IGC Show is the world's biggest buying and education event for independent garden centers.

She is the founder of the Association of Women Surgeons, former president of the American College of Surgeons, and professor emeritus at the State University of New York Upstate Medical University. Early life Numann was born in New York City on April 6, 1941, but moved to rural New York as a young child when her father lost his job in the city. She grew up in Denver, New York, a small town in the Catskill Mountains, and attended Roxbury Central School in Roxbury, New York.

He is a former president of the Union des √©tudiants juifs de France (UEJF, Union of French Jewish students), and is a militant anti-racist.  Biography = Professional career  Patrick Klugman was born on 11 July 1977 in Neuilly-sur-Seine. He studied law at Panth√©on-Assas University and Paris Dauphine University, where he completed a postgraduate course under the direction of Marie-Anne Frison-Roche. He was sworn in at the bar in 2004. In March 2007 he joined the offices of the attorney Francis Szpiner, whom he supported in court during the second sitting of the Sohane Benziane case. In 2006, he was one of the attorneys in the case of the murder of Chaib Zehaf. In October 2008, he founded the firm PK Avocats with Pierre-Andr√© Pascaud. As an attorney he was particularly involved in criminal cases with media coverage, such as those aimed at the Socialist deputy Julien Dray. He was one of the attorneys for Jamel Leulmi, who was sentenced to 30 years in prison in a criminal case with some media coverage. He also represented in France the family of Gilad Shalit, a French-Israeli hostage released on 18 October 2011 after more than five years of captivity at the hands of Hamas. Patrick Klugman was also the lawyer of the writer Yann Moix, of Georges-Marc Benamou, Father Patrick Desbois, actor Omar Sy, designer Ito Morabito, essayist Caroline Fourest, writer Bernard-Henri L√©vy and the FEMEN. In 2005 he took up the cause of jailed Russian oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky. With his colleague, Fran√ßois Saint-Pierre, he pleaded for the Zehaf family in the case known as the \\"murder of Oulins\\" by developing the theory of a racist murder. This theory was rejected by the assizes of the Rhone in January 2009. Patrick Klugman was also the lawyer of the SOS Racisme association in several cases. Patrick Klugman was the counselor of Lo√Øk Le Floch-Prigent, the former CEO of French oil giant Elf, who was imprisoned on 15 September 2012 in the cells of the gendarmerie in Lom√©, Togo, and charged with fraud.  Political career An associate of Bertrand Delano√´, for whom he voted at the Reims Congress, Patrick Klugman was elected to the Council of Paris in the 17th arrondissement in the elections in March 2008. He appeared in second place among the \\"openness\\" group on the municipal list of the Socialist Party, led in this district by the deputy Annick Lepetit. Since then, he has joined the Socialist Party and is vice president of the Socialist, Radical and Left group in the Council of Paris. In the Council of Paris he often speaks on issues related to public freedom and international relations. He sits in the 9th Committee (culture and international relations). Patrick Klugman supported Fran√ßois Hollande for the presidential election of 2012 and the citizen primaries that preceded it. He supported Anne Hidalgo for mayor of Paris during the municipal elections of 2014 in Paris. He was named after his election on 5 April 2014 as assistant for International Relations and the Francophonie.  Media activities and positions = Anti-racist militant Patrick Klugman was a member of the national office, then vice president of SOS Racisme. He was known for strong positions against quotas and ethnic statistics, and for strengthening secularism. He actively participated in the campaign against using DNA testing for prospective immigrants under the family reunification program. In 2003‚Äì04 he was representative in France of the Geneva initiative, which offered an alternative approach to peace between Israelis and Palestinians. Previously, Patrick Klugman was known during his tenure as President of the UEJF (2001‚Äì03) for his active contribution to recognition of the resurgence of anti-Semitism in France. This was illustrated by the positions that were both Republican (\\"son of Abraham and of Marianne\\") and iconoclastic (\\"I am a Zionist and pro- Palestinian\\"). Patrick Klugman was also a co-opted member of the Steering Committee of the Conseil Repr√©sentatif des Institutions juives de France (Representative Council of French Jewish Institutions). As President of UEJF, he participated in writing two books: The antifeujs, the White Paper of anti- Semitic violence in France and Zionism explained to our friends. In The Affair of the Gang of Barbarians he called for opening the closed doors so the case could be tried with a more extensive publicity.  Regular guest speaker  Between 2004 and 2008, when the show went off the air, Patrick Klugman was one of the regularly invited guests in the talk show N'ayons pas peur des mots (Let us not mince words) hosted by Samuel Etienne on I-T√©l√©. Since then, he has often taken part in the live debate (Le Grand Direct) of the news every day at 13:15 pm hosted by Jean-Marc Morandini on Europe 1. Since the beginning of 2010, Patrick Klugman appears every week in his blog titled Plaidoyers (Advocacy) on the website of the R√®gle du Jeu (Rule of the Game), a literary magazine founded and directed by Bernard-Henri L√©vy. He also has a weekly slot on Friday morning at 8:20 am on radio RCJ. In addition, he often publishes opinion columns in daily newspapers.  Controversies  During the 2002 presidential elections, Patrick Klugman accused Jean-Marie Le Pen of plagiarizing Adolf Hitler, saying \\"By declaring that he was socially of the left and nationally of France, Jean-Marie Le Pen repeated the words of Adolf Hitler in November 1932 in his closing speech of the National Socialist Party Congress. Le Pen made his \\"coming out\\" and revealed his Hitlerite convictions\\". The same day, the daily Lib√©ration denied the information. This quotation of Hitler would never have existed as well as the Nazi congress of 29 November 1932.Lib√©ration, 25 avril 2002, Commenting on the withdrawal of Patrick Klugman from proceedings brought against Edgar Morin, the lawyer and essayist Gilles-William Goldnadel described Klugman as an \\"obsequious courtier\\". On 26 February 2006 Patrick Klugman expelled deputy Philippe de Villiers from a demonstration in honor of Ilan Halimi. This behavior was strongly condemned by the Jewish community. In a letter addressed to Philippe de Villiers, the President of the Central Consistory, Jean Kahn, expressed \\"his condemnation of the behavior of those whom you so rudely rebuffed.\\" The lawyer of the Consistory and of the Grand Rabbinate of France, Jean Alex Buchinger, notes that \\"such behavior [...] is even less acceptable in that it is targeting a son of a resistant who never failed to defend our Judeo- Christian values\\". In Jacob Cohen's book Le printemps des sayanim (2010) the character \\"Sayan\\" appears under the name of Patrick Glukmann.

They affected the Coromandel Coast region of the South Indian states of Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. More than 500 people were killed and over 1.8 million (18 lakh) people were displaced. With estimates of damages and losses ranging from nearly to over , the floods were the costliest to have occurred in 2015, and were among the costliest natural disasters of the year. Though the unusually heavy rainfall in southern India during the winter of 2015 has been attributed to the 2014‚Äì16 El Ni√±o event, in July 2018 the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) categorised the flooding across Tamil Nadu as a \\"man-made disaster,\\" and held the Government of Tamil Nadu responsible for the scale of the catastrophe, which the latter had termed a natural disaster. Background=Geographical and meteorological explained From October to December each year, a very large area of south India, including Tamil Nadu, the coastal regions of the Andhra Pradesh and the union territory of Puducherry, receives up to 60 percent of its annual rainfall from the northeast monsoon (or winter monsoon). The northeast monsoon is the result of the annual gradual retreat of monsoonal rains from northeastern India. Unlike during the regular monsoon, rainfall during the northeast monsoon is sporadic, but typically far exceeds the amount produced by the regular monsoon by up to 90 percent. This excessive rainfall can be exacerbated by an El Nino of order of the magnitude which has since been evaluated to every year, such as 2015. The coastal districts of Andhra Pradesh usually bear the brunt of heavy rains that occur during the northeast monsoon; with numerous river systems and wetlands, Puducherry and eastern Tamil Nadu are prone to flooding. The city of Chennai alone experienced five major floods between 1943 and 2005, with the 1943, 1978 and 2005 floods causing particularly severe damage. In addition, unplanned and often illegal urban development has led to many wetlands and natural sinks being built over; this, along with ageing civic infrastructure and poorly designed drainage systems, has resulted in an increased frequency of severe flooding. Weather systems On 8 November 2015, during the annual cyclone season, a low pressure area consolidated into a depression and slowly intensified into a deep depression before crossing the coast of Tamil Nadu near Puducherry the following day. Because of land interaction and high vertical wind shear, the system weakened into a well-marked low-pressure area over north Tamil Nadu on 10 November. The system brought very heavy rainfall over the coastal and the north interior districts of Tamil Nadu. On 13 November, Kanchipuram recorded 340 mm of rain and several low-lying areas were inundated and Vembakkam close to Kanchipuram recorded 470 mm. On 15 November, a well-marked low-pressure area moved northwards along the Tamil Nadu coast, dropping huge amounts of rainfall over coastal Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh with 24‚Äëhour totals peaking at 370 mm in Ponneri. Chennai International Airport recorded 266 mm of rainfall in 24 hours. On 28‚Äì29 November, another system developed and arrived over Tamil Nadu on 30 November, bringing additional rain and flooding. The system dropped 490 mm of rainfall at Tambaram in 24 hours starting 8:30 am on 1 December. Very heavy rains led to flooding across the entire stretch of coast from Chennai to Cuddalore. A study from IISc shows that on 1 December, clouds were stationary over Chennai. This study showed that the mountains of Eastern Ghats blocked clouds that came from the Bay of Bengal from moving further inland. The mechanism is referred to as 'upstream blocking'. Therefore, they were stationary over Chennai throughout the day. These clouds gave continuous rainfall over Chennai that caused massive flooding. Floods in Tamilnadu=Chennai Chennai airport Between 9 and 10 November 2015, Neyveli received of rainfall; rains continued to lash Cuddalore, Chidambaram, Tiruvallur , Kanchipuram and Chennai. Several low-lying areas in Kanchipuram, including major thoroughfare Gandhi Road, were inundated as the city and its neighbourhood received a heavy precipitation of 340mm during the 24-hours that ended with 8.30 a.m. on 13 November 2015. The Manjalneer Kalvai, primarily a flood drain channel for the city, overflowed after the Netteri lake breached on the Kancheepuram-Vellore Road in the wee hours of Friday, flooding the entire stretch of Gandhi Road and Munusamy Mudaliyar Avenue and forcing the police to close for traffic the prime junction Moongil Mandapam where the Gandhi Road joins with Vallal Pachaiyappan Salai. Kanchipuram Collector R.Gajalakshmi told reporters later that a total of 7,294 persons were rescued from inundated areas and accommodated in 26 shelters opened by the civic body. Boats were used to rescue the people from inundated areas in Pillayarpalayam, the Collector said. And also Vembakkam close to Kanchipuram recorded 470mm of rain on 13 November 2015. Continuing rains led to low-lying parts of Chennai becoming inundated by 13 November, resulting in the evacuation of over 1000 people from their homes. The flooding in Chennai city was worsened by years of illegal development and inadequate levels of flood preparedness. Much of the city remained flooded on 17 November, though rainfall had largely ceased. Chennai received of rainfall in November, the highest recorded since November 1918 when in of rainfall was recorded. Kancheepuram district registered the heaviest rainfall‚Äî183% higher at 181.5 cm as against average rainfall of 64 cm in October‚ÄìDecember period and Tiruvallur district recorded 146 cm compared to average 59 cm of rain. The flooding in Chennai city was described as the worst in a century. The continued rains led to schools and colleges remaining closed across Puducherry and Chennai, Kancheepuram and Tiruvallur districts in Tamil Nadu, and fishermen were warned against sailing because of high waters and rough seas. Aerial view of flood-hit areas of Chennai Though rainfall from the earlier low pressure system ended on 24 November, another system developed on 29 November, bringing additional rain and the Indian Meteorological Department predicted heavy rainfall over Tamil Nadu until the end of the week. On 1 December, heavy rains led to inundation in many areas of Chennai. By afternoon, power supplies were suspended to 60% of the city while several city hospitals stopped functioning. The same day, Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu Jayalalithaa announced that, because of the continued flooding and rains, half-yearly school examinations originally scheduled for 7 December would be postponed until the first week in January. For the first time since its founding in 1878, the major newspaper The Hindu did not publish a print edition on 2 December, as workers were unable to reach the press building. The Southern Railways cancelled major train services and Chennai International Airport was closed until 6 December. Chennai was officially declared a disaster area on the evening of 2 December. At the MIOT Hospital, 14 patients died after power and oxygen supplies failed. With a letup in rainfall, floodwaters gradually began to recede in Chennai on 4 December, though 40 percent of the city's districts remained submerged and safe food and drinking water remained in short supply. Though relief efforts were well underway across most of the area by 3 December, the lack of any coordinated relief response in North Chennai forced thousands of its residents to evacuate on their own. As intermittent rains returned, thousands of displaced residents from Chennai, Kancheepuram and Tiruvallur districts attempted to flee the stricken region by bus or train and travel to their family homes. Chennai International Airport was partly reopened for cargo flights on 5 December, with passenger flights scheduled to resume from the following morning. By 6 December, rescue efforts had largely concluded and relief efforts intensified, with the Chennai Corporation beginning to disburse relief packages. Mobile, banking and power services were gradually restored; fuel and food supplies were reaching their destinations, the airport had fully reopened and rail services slowly resumed. Many city neighbourhoods, however, remained flooded with some lacking basic necessities due to the uncoordinated distribution of relief materials. With the city slowly beginning to recover, state and national health officials remained watchful against disease outbreaks, warning that conditions were right for epidemics of water-borne illnesses to occur. Chennai Corporation officials reported at least 57,000 homes in the city had suffered structural damage, mostly those of working class. State housing boards said they would conduct safety inspections of both public and residential buildings. After being closed for the past month, schools and colleges across the affected districts began to reopen from 14 December. Relief operations were largely wound up by 19 December. South of Chennai, heavy rains and flooding persisted into the second week of December. In Kancheepuram district, Chengalpattu, kanchipuram, Nandivaram- Guduvanchery, Perungalathur, Tambaram, Mudichur and Anakaputhur were inundated in floodwaters up to 7 metres deep by 5 December, which washed away roads and severed rail links; 98 people from the district were reported to have died. During 4‚Äì5 December, parts of Villupuram and Tiruvarur districts received up to 10 centimetres of rain, while some towns in Cuddalore district saw up to nine centimetres. Flood alerts were broadcast to 12 villages in the neighbourhood of the Tirumurthy dam in Tirupur district on 7 December, as the dam was likely to reach capacity within two days; the residents of those villages were urged to evacuate. Due to rainfall in Tirunelveli district, all of its dams had reached or were approaching full capacity by 7 December, forcing local authorities to discharge thousands of cusecs of water from reservoirs and causing the Thamirabarani River to reach flood stage. Torrential rains inundated hundreds of acres of paddy fields in Thanjavur, Tiruvarur and Nagapattinam districts, and caused residential areas to flood by 8 December. Large parts of Thanjavur city were marooned by rising waters, while several houses collapsed under the brunt of rainfall in Kumbakonam and Veppathoor. After Chennai district, Cuddalore district was among those most severely affected by the flooding. Six of the district's 13 blocks suffered extensive damage during the floods in November. The resumption of heavy rainfall from 1 December again inundated the Cuddalore municipality and the district, displacing tens of thousands of people. Rains continued through 9 December. Despite the state government and individuals sending rescue teams and tonnes of relief materials to the district, thousands of those affected continued to lack basic supplies due to inadequate distribution efforts; this resulted in several relief lorries being stopped and looted by survivors. Large swaths of Cuddalore city and the district remained inundated as of 10 December, with thousands of residents marooned by floodwaters and over 60,000 hectares of farmland inundated; over 30,000 people had been evacuated to relief camps. The state government reported preliminary flood damages of , and requested for immediate relief efforts. On 5 December, a senior state revenue official said the state's official estimates of flood-related losses in November alone exceeded ; he added the catastrophic flooding thus far in December could escalate total losses to well over . On 9 December, Chief Minister Jayalalithaa wrote to Prime Minister Modi, requesting him to immediately declare the \\"unprecedented, catastrophic and cataclysmic\\" flooding as a \\"national calamity.\\" Aon Benfield, a major UK-based reinsurance broker, classified the floods as the costliest to have occurred in 2015, and the eight-costliest natural disaster of the year. On 13 December, the state government requested the central government to release a total of ‚Çπ102.50 billion (US$1.53 billion) towards relief and rehabilitation efforts, including for a housing project to accommodate 50,000 displaced people, to rehouse another 50,000 people who had formerly lived in huts destroyed by the floods and to rebuild damaged roads, drains, tap water pipes and sewers in urban localities. On 22 December, the government further revised its estimates, requesting ‚Çπ174315.1 million (US$2.63 billion) in addition to the ‚Çπ84.81 billion previously requested for the flood damage sustained in November, for a total of ‚Çπ259125.1 million (US$3.91 billion). In January 2016, the state government issued a detailed final statement which said 421 people in Tamil Nadu had died of flood-related causes between 28 October, when the first monsoonal rains had arrived in earnest, through 31 December;Not including 49 people who had died between 1‚Äì28 October as a result of the monsoon. however, relief workers alone had reported hundreds more who were missing, and various police reports had placed the death toll in the Chennai region alone at over 500 as of mid-December. Chennai-area morgues and crematoria were reported to have been \\"piled up\\" with bodies as floodwaters began receding in the second week of December, while all of the still-functioning area cemeteries had recorded over three times the usual number of burials, up from a normal 25‚Äì30 burials per week. According to the Tamil Nadu government, 3042,000 (3.042 million) families had suffered total or partial damage to their dwellings. 3,8276.8 million hectares of crops had been lost due to flooding, including over 347,000 hectares of agricultural crops and 35,471 hectares of horticultural crops; roughly 98,000 livestock animals and poultry had died. On 25 April 2018, the skeleton of a man reported missing during the floods was discovered in the Chennai neighbourhood of Peerkankaranai near Tambaram, though a definitive identification could not be made immediately. Tambram got worst of it Puducherry Puducherry sustained relatively minor damage in November as the depression largely remained offshore; some trees were downed and several banana and sugarcane plantations at Kuttchipalayam were severely damaged. Puducherry reported receiving 55.7 mm of rainfall over the 24-hour period from 14‚Äì15 November. Water entered several houses in low-lying areas, while three houses collapsed in Uppalam. Mudaliarpet, parts of Rainbow Nagar, Muthialpet, Krishna Nagar and Lawspet Main Road were inundated, along with portions of roadways near Karuvadikkuppam and the Shivaji statue on the ECR, causing traffic problems. Several roads were badly damaged, hindering motorists, while some members of the public took the initiative to begin clearing areas of water without directions from the government. Chief Minister N Rangasamy stated the official machinery had been readied in preparation for any flooding, while local administration officials closed all schools and colleges in Puducherry and Karaikal districts on 16 November, anticipating further rainfall. On 24 November, it was reported over 4800 hectares of farmland had been flooded, though it remained too early to determine the extent of crop damage. On 26 November, the union territorial government submitted a preliminary estimate of damages to the central government, requesting it to release an initial for relief; based on preliminary estimates, Chief Minister Rangasamy reported losses as follows: public works (), municipal administration (), agriculture (), power (), revenue () and animal husbandry (). On 1 December, Rangasamy requested an additional for \\"immediate interim relief\\". At the start of December, Puducherry reported receiving 83.4 centimetres of rain during November alone, as opposed to a normal average of 76.7 centimetres during the entire north-east monsoonal period from October to December. Since rain-related damage had continued even after the submission of a report on the earlier flooding in November, and also after the recent visit of a central government survey team, on 4 December the Puducherry government said it would submit a supplementary report assessing additional damages and requesting for a total relief-fund requirement of . From 1 December, torrential rains again inundated portions of the union territory. Puducherry recorded 22 cm of rainfall over a 24-hour period, making it the wettest December day ever.

As rainfall began in Andhra Pradesh on 16 November, local authorities closed schools in Nellore district. Heavy rain of about 27 cm pounded the temple town of Tirupathi. Thousands of lakes and ponds across the district overflowed, with breaches reported in some areas. At Sri Kalahasti, a pilgrimage centre in the region, the Swarnamukhi River was reported to be rising. Three people were swept away by floodwaters in Chittoor district, and water entered some houses. Roads were damaged in many parts of Nellore district, disrupting transport services. Andhra Pradesh chief minister Chandrababu Naidu held a teleconference with the district collectors of affected districts and asked disaster response personnel to be on alert. Heavy rainfall in Nellore, Chittoor and Kadapa districts flooded villages and disrupted transport networks. It was estimated by 18 November that at least 500 km of roads had been damaged by flooding, with the Chennai-Kolkata highway damaged the previous day and stranding hundreds of vehicles and motorists; officials said it would take days to restore the link. As in Tamil Nadu, the Southern Railway diverted or cancelled numerous trains. Over 10,000 lorry drivers were stranded on the Tada-Kavali national highway in Nellore district; district officers established 61 relief camps in the flood-affected areas and deputed senior IAS officers to oversee the relief operations in Gudur, Naidupet and Atmakur divisions, respectively. Up to 500 tanks were breached as rivers overflowed, forcing the administration to suspend rescue operations in marooned villages, though administrators supplied 10,000 food and water packets through the rail network, which managed to operate some trains, while the APSRTC continued to run bus services to less-flooded areas such as Atmakuru, Udayagiri, Marripadu and Seetharampuram.

Apart from airfares in South India, airfares also increased for other connections within the country, due to disruptions in rail services. In response, the Ministry of Civil Aviation warned companies against taking advantage of the situation to overcharge and that it would intervene if any of the passenger flight carriers did so. On its own, the civil aviation ministry also operated flights from the Rajali naval airbase in Arakonam, Chennai with a fixed price of per passenger for travel to the northern states and per passenger for travel to the southern states.

Hyundai India donated to the Tamil Nadu Chief Minister's Relief fund; U.S. information technology multinational Cognizant made a direct donation of to the relief fund and various Chennai-based NGOs, while contributing a further towards the long-term recovery efforts of staff and business partners. Several notable actors donated towards relief efforts, including: Vijay (), Rajinikanth (), Raghava Lawrence (), Ajith Kumar (), Shah Rukh Khan ()., Allu Arjun (), Suriya and Karthi (), Vishal (), Dhanush (), Varun Tej () and Sai Dharam Tej (, in food and medicines). Telugu actors, including Ravi Teja, N. T. Rama Rao Jr., Mahesh Babu, Pawan Kalyan, Prabhas, and Rana Daggubati donated a further , Actress Shriya Saran donated medical supplies to the affected regions in Chennai while also giving means for anyone to contribute supplies through her foundation Shree Spandana. Saina Nehwal and Dipika Pallikal announced a donation of each for the flood victims. Retired Sri Lankan cricketers Kumar Sangakkara and Muttiah Muralitharan donated and respectively while Indian cricketer M.S. Dhoni donated . Sex workers in the Ahmednagar district of Maharashtra donated towards flood relief efforts by using their savings and eating just one meal a day. A group of Carnatic musicians including vocalists K.N. Shashikiran, Aruna Sairam, P. Unnikrishnan, Nirmala Rajasekar, P. Ganesh and Thanjavur Murugaboopathi distributed food and supplies to families. Film composer Anirudh Ravichander announced that proceeds from his Anirudh Live concert in Toronto would go to relief efforts in Chennai. Amongst several tribute songs, actor Vikram produced and directed a song titled \\"Spirit of Chennai\\" featuring several South Indian film actors and singers. Aftermath By the end of December 2015, most hospitals in Chennai had wholly or partially restored services. State health authorities in Tamil Nadu reported post-flooding sanitation efforts had been successful, and that there had not been any flood-related outbreaks of disease. While floodwaters had largely receded by 19 December, areas of stagnant water covered parts of Tamil Nadu into January 2016, notably around Cuddalore and Tuticorin. Central government survey teams conducted studies on the extent on the flooding in early January. From 29 December 2015, the Tamil Nadu state government began a massive slum clearance programme, demolishing dozens of illegally constructed dwellings in the Saidapet area of Chennai. Located along the banks of the Adyar River, the area had been among those worst affected by the floods. The residents were rehoused in government housing being built in Okkiyam Thoraipakkam and Perumbakkam. The government further announced that the rehoused residents would receive an allowance of a year to help them resettle. Medical care would be arranged, children would be enrolled in schools and vocational training would be provided for job-seekers. Despite voicing concern over their ability to find new jobs, many of those resettled expressed satisfaction with the new flats. By March 2016, 4,100 families who had lived in the area had been resettled, and the city corporation had cleared away hundreds of illegally encroaching constructions, widening the Adyar River in Saidapet to 220 metres from its previous 50-metre width. The Chennai Corporation said civic construction projects totalling and halted by the floods would resume in earnest, and would be completed by 29 February 2016. The corporation also announced that damaged roads would quickly be re-paved and previously shelved storm drain projects would resume. By February 2016, repair work on the damaged boundary walls at Chennai International Airport had largely been completed. Based on the findings of a preliminary report submitted by an IIT-Madras research team, the Airports Authority of India (AAI) announced plans to conduct a full study of the causes of excessive flooding at the airport, along with plans to implement a comprehensive flood- management system; the study was expected to be completed by the end of 2016. In March 2016, Chennai's Water Resources Department began work to revitalise and repair reservoirs in Poondi, Cholavaram, Red Hills and Chembarambakkam. The project would include work to strengthen bunds, install flood warning systems and repair sluice gates; it was scheduled to be completed by the end of 2016, at a cost of . Local NGOs and hydrology experts emphasised the continued need for a comprehensive action plan to protect urban water bodies, however. In state legislative assembly elections in May 2016, the AIADMK was returned to power in Tamil Nadu, albeit with a reduced majority. The party lost eight seats to the opposing DMK in Chennai district and a further eight seats elsewhere; its losses were attributed to its perceived failure to properly address the flood crisis. On 16 June, K. Rosaiah, the governor of Tamil Nadu, announced the state government would soon develop comprehensive flood protection plans for Chennai and its surrounding coastal districts; he said the emphasis would be on providing better roads, storm water drains, solid waste management, sewerage management and street lights. The initiatives would be synergised with the Smart Cities Programme and the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation scheme. Funding had also been obtained from the World Bank and from the Asian Development Bank for climate-change impact reduction initiatives, as well as for the restoration of water bodies and tanks. As of July 2016, however, local citizens' groups said no constructive work had been done to rejuvenate local water bodies and that the effects of a similar north-east monsoon would have an equally destructive impact. In August 2016, a parliamentary panel recommended an immediate special relief and rehabilitation package for Tamil Nadu, in \\"consonance with the demand of the state.\\" Observing a monetary estimate for flood-related damages in the state could total \\"thousands of crores,\\" the panel's recommendations included a crackdown on criminals involved in illegal construction, a swift removal of illegal encroachments from flood channels and riverbeds, the preparation of a calamity map of all important cities and including \\"standard vulnerability indices,\\" and a continued level of high vigilance by central and state authorities, notably by the Home Affairs Ministry and the National Disaster Management Authority. In response to harsh criticism of a severe lack of transparency and co-ordination during the crisis, the Tamil Nadu government developed a comprehensive disaster response plan, which was successfully implemented when Cyclone Vardah struck the state in December 2016; the plan effectively coordinated local, state and national relief efforts during and after the cyclone. In February 2017, the Tamil Nadu government announced plans to desilt 12 waterbodies in Chennai at a cost of . In April, the Chennai city corporation began the process of mechanically desilting the city's canals and drains using imported recyclers and robotic excavators. Elsewhere in Tamil Nadu, 49 projects in Kancheepuram district to reclaim, revive and strengthen bunds and waterbodies were reported to be nearing completion, at a cost of . In May 2017, the Tamil Nadu government inaugurated several flood protection and dam construction and rebuilding projects in Cuddalore district, which had been one of the worst-affected districts during the floods; the projects were estimated to cost . In June, representatives of the Chennai Water Resources Department said the department was developing an eight-year, \\"master plan\\" to restore 18 major waterbodies in the Chennai metropolitan area. Analysis of causes=Unregulated urban planning and illegal construction Union Minister for Environment and Forests Prakash Javadekar termed the Chennai floods a \\"natural disaster of unappreciated scale\\", and said it provided lessons to improve urban planning and improve city governance. \\"Chennai gives a lesson, and we must learn from this lesson and improve our urban planning and improve city governance, which is very essential.\\" He also criticised the Chennai Corporation for not having done enough \\"to remove all encroachments. Unless you allow the drains to flow freely to the sea, water will be clogged and that is what has unfortunately happened.\\" Sunita Narain, the director of the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) think tank, said the unprecedented floods in the Chennai metropolitan region were the direct result of unregulated urbanisation. According to Narain, \\"our urban sprawls such as Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai, Chennai, Srinagar, etc., have not paid adequate attention to the natural water bodies that exist in them. In Chennai, each of its lakes has a natural flood discharge channel which drains the spillover. But we have built over many of these water bodies, blocking the smooth flow of water. We have forgotten the art of drainage. We only see land for buildings, not for water.\\" According to research conducted by CSE, Chennai had over 600 lakes in the 1980s, but a master plan published in 2008 showed only a fraction of them to be in a healthy condition. State records have shown the total area of 19 major lakes shrank from 1,130 hectares in the 1980s to around 645 hectares in the early 2000s, reducing their storage capacity. Improper design and maintenance of drainage systems Media reports stated the Chennai Corporation had ignored September warnings of above-average monsoonal rains issued by the Indian Meteorological Department, and that extensive and costly projects begun in 2013 to desilt city storm drains had been ineffectively conducted. The drains themselves were reported to have been shoddily built and improperly designed. Drains carrying surplus water from tanks to other wetlands had also been encroached upon, while city storm water drains were clogged and required immediate desilting. Chennai has only 855 km of stormwater drains against 2,847 km of urban roads, resulting in flooding after even a marginally heavy downpour. A 2015 CAG report revealed that a diversion channel from the Buckingham canal near Okkiyum Maduvu to the sea (a drain project under the JNNURM scheme) could have saved South Chennai from flooding; the government, however, dropped the ‚Çπ1 billion scheme, which, had it been completed, would have drained floodwater from southern neighbourhood at a rate of 3,500 cubic feet per second. The 2015 CAG report said the defective planning of flood control projects caused delays and increased costs, defeating the objective of the scheme. \\"The fact is that alleviation of inundation of flood water in Chennai city remains largely unachieved\\", it said. Climate-change related Union Environment and Forests Minister Javadekar said the exact causes of the flooding ‚Äì whether the result of climate change or stemming from other causes ‚Äì remained in \\"a grey area\\" as experts had differing opinions. Regarding the current floods, he said the United Nations would not deem the evidence conclusive enough to be able to reach a judgment. \\"One thing is sure, climate change brings such disasters more frequently. So [the] frequency, [the] ferocity of untimely rains increases, [along with] erratic monsoons, droughts and floods; all these are caused [by climate change].\\" he said. He subsequently clarified his position on the Tamil Nadu floods in a written statement addressed to the Rajya Sabha. According to Javadekar, the recent extreme rainfall across the region was \\"highly localised\\" and could not be definitively attributed to the effects of climate-change. \\"[The] extreme rainfall that occurred over [the] coastal districts of Tamil Nadu is part of the natural variability of the Indian monsoon system. Although some studies have reported an increase in frequency and intensity of extremes in rainfall during the past 40‚Äì50 years, their attribution to global warming is not established.\\" Javadekar said the Inter- Governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and local assessments have indicated that extreme rainfall events will likely increase in frequency by the end of the 21st century. In 2006, a study by the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) in Pune showed extreme precipitation events had increased in frequency and intensity in India over the period from 1950 to the 2000s; while CSE's climate change experts recommend detailed attribution studies to establish more links between the Chennai floods and climate change, they did state that existing scientific studies establish a possible connection. Controversies=Inadequate response of authorities Many flood victims across Chennai and Tamil Nadu protested ineffectual response and the lack of help from authorities. In the chief minister's state assembly constituency of Dr. Radhakrishnan Nagar, flood victims heckled senior ministers Natham Viswanathan, Sellur Raju and Gokul Indira following their visit on 4 December, forcing them to make a hasty retreat. At a subsequent press conference, Tamil Nadu Power Minister Natham Viswanathan and chief secretary Gnanadesikan claimed that relief and rescue work were in full swing and \\"extraordinary\\". Viswanathan deflected opposition criticism of relief efforts as politically motivated, in light of upcoming assembly elections. He claimed people in even the worst-affected localities had refused to leave their homes and had accepted only food relief from official agencies. Following a statement by Chief Minister Jayalalithaa that the flooding had been the result of exceptional rainfall, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) issued a strong criticism on 16 November, stating that the flooding in Chennai could have been averted if local and state officials had taken strong precautions. The state BJP president, Tamilisai Soundararajan, said: \\"Even if it was six months of rain on a single day, the administration should have been ready to tackle it.\\" Tamilisai mentioned the cleaning and de-silting of the Cooum River would allow it to divert large amounts of runoff during the monsoons. In North Chennai area, residents staged protests and criticised the government for its lack of any rescue response in their locality. In Puducherry, AIADMK legislator A Anbazhagan said that the government was not providing relief to affected people and had not taken any precautions, contrary to the government's assurances; he added the administration failed to promptly mobilise various essential departments and urged the territorial administration to carefully prepare a report to ensure delivery of relief to those affected. Jet Skis and SUV vehicles were used in places like Anna Nagar to aid the people in mobility due to the high water level. Following numerous complaints regarding the Tamil Nadu state government's lack of relief effort co-ordination, a public-interest litigation petition was filed in the Madras High Court; on 11 December, Chief Justice S.K. Kaul and Justice Puspha Sathyanarayana heard the petition and converted it to suo moto proceedings. The justices directed the state government to report its relief-effort co- ordination measures to the court by 16 December. After the Tamil Nadu government announced a flood-relief package on 7 December, many flood survivors criticised it as meagre and \\"insulting.\\" DMK leader M.K. Stalin said the state's financial assistance of for each displaced family \\"would not be of much help to the people.\\" A survey conducted in the worst-affected districts of Chennai by a group of volunteer organisations between 15‚Äì30 December found that most families had lost their sources of livelihood, and that the amount of financial assistance was insufficient. Lacking ration cards, migrant workers were the worst off, as they were ineligible for any assistance. Many residents in those areas complained the authorities had insufficiently taken measures to prepare for the floods. The National Campaign on Dalit Human Rights (NCDHR) and the Social Awareness Society for Youths (SASY) surveyed 8,400 Dalit and non-Dalit families in 20 villages in the Cuddalore region in December 2015 and found that around 90 percent of the houses, livestock and crops destroyed in the floods belonged to Dalit families, who made up the majority of flood-displaced people. The final report alleged dominant caste people blocked access to clean water, medicines; official relief measures were concentrated in more accessible upper-caste neighbourhoods. On average, a majority of Dalit settlements were located only 1.5 km from rivers, canals and the sea and most primary health centres were located in dominant caste neighbourhoods and were, on average, three km from Dalit settlements. Criticism of AIADMK The AIADMK received heavy public criticism following reports of party workers pasting photographs of party leader and Tamil Nadu chief minister Jayalalithaa on relief materials, erecting banners and posters praising her, allegedly halting relief shipments en route to Chennai to paste her photos on relief packages and threatening volunteers. These incidents were reported mostly in Chennai and Cuddalore. In one incident caught on video and widely broadcast on Tamil television, an AIADMK functionary mouthing expletives and accompanied by henchmen was seen intimidating volunteers from Bengaluru who were preparing food in Anna Nagar for distribution to flood- affected people; the cadre demanded 2,000 relief packets so he could be seen distributing them. The party also released a poem on social media praising Jayalalithaa despite near-universal condemnation of government relief efforts. In response to the mounting criticism, an AIADMK party official said the media was distorting events and attempting to smear the party before the upcoming assembly elections; however, he promised the party would take strict action against those obstructing relief work. CPI (Marxist) leader U Vasuki said, \\"The whole state is in crisis. This is not the right time to shower praise. Moreover, the state [government] has not done anything commendable to [merit] praise [of its] relief efforts. The timing of such propaganda is shocking.\\" Media controversies In Tamil Nadu, partisan television channels associated with the ruling AIADMK and the opposing DMK political parties were criticised for using the disaster for their own political purposes. Also, several claimed that the political parties obstructed the flood relief efforts of the volunteers for their own gains. National media outlets were widely criticised on social media for failing to adequately report on the flood crisis. On 2 December, the government Press Information Bureau (PIB) released an edited photo showing the Prime Minister looking down from an aircraft window which was removed after criticism.

He was the chief of United Nations Truce Supervision Organization in Palestine, the Supreme Commander of the United Nations Operation in the Congo during the Congo Crisis, and commander of United Nations Yemen Observation Mission in Yemen. Career von Horn was born on 15 July 1903 in Vittsk√∂vle, Sweden, the son of cavalry captain Carl von Horn and his wife Martha (n√©e Stjernsw√§rd). The younger brother, Jan von Horn, also chose a military career and eventually became a colonel and military attach√© in London and The Hague. von Horn became an officer in the Life Guards of Horse (K 1) in 1923. He was promoted to captain of the General Staff in 1935 and served in the Swedish Army Service Troops in 1939. von Horn was promoted to major of the General Staff and the Defence Staff in 1942 and was chief of bureau at the Royal Railway Board's military bureau. During World War II he helped organizing prisoner exchange between the Germans and the Allies, but also had to work with the Swedish extradition of Baltic soldiers. As a military man with a strong Anglo-Saxon ethos he called this \\"the most humiliating moment in modern Swedish history.\\" von Horn was promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1945 when he also became chief of the Defence Staff's Communication Department. In 1947, von Horn was appointed military attach√© in Oslo, and the following year he moved to Copenhagen where he had received a similar appointment. In 1949 he returned to Sweden and took a position at the Northern Sm√•land Regiment (I 12) and the following year he was promoted to colonel and commander of Kronoberg Regiment (I 11) in V√§xj√∂. He stayed there for seven years; in 1957, he was appointed commander of Malm√∂ Defence District (Fo 11). UN career In early 1958, von Horn was appointed chief of United Nations Truce Supervision Organization in Palestine by Dag Hammarskj√∂ld, and was then promoted to major general. At first he allowed himself \\"to be optimistic\\" and he wrote in his memoirs that \\"instead of fully armed troops, tanks and artillery or even the threat of sanctions, Dag's moral support and my own determination was everything I had.\\" In 1960 he became with short notice the Supreme Commander of the UN Force in the Congo during the beginning of what was to develop into the Congo Crisis, a mission, however, he was dismissed from six months later. von Horn then returned to work for the UN in Palestine. In 1963 he was sent to lead the UN observatory group United Nations Yemen Observation Mission in Yemen where fighting continued between government troops and rebels. von Horn has been described as an arrogant leader, and also during the mission in Yemen, he quarreled with his superiors. von Horn suddenly resigned in protest and accused the UN not to provide enough resources for the mission, accusations that the Secretary-General U Thant described as \\"irresponsible and reckless\\". von Horn had refused to abide by the UN organization's demands for policy adjustments and opposed when politicians wanted to aggravate the situation in the field. Personal life von Horn was married three times. In the first marriage 1925‚Äì1944 he was married to baroness Maud von Otter (1904‚Äì1974), the daughter of major, baron Carl-Gustaf von Otter and Elisabeth (n√©e Krook).

The name Mfalikuivahaa was better known when many areas in Africa were ruled through forms of governance that place power in the hands of a small, privileged ruling class of elders, leaders, and Shamans. Such a tribal assembly played an important role in the lives of many Africans contrasting as a form of governance to direct democracy today.  Origins = Aggrandizing the dynasty  In the late 1700s, early 1800s the area that became Tanganyika, and then Tanzania, a part of the Great Lakes region, consisted of many small kingdoms/ Chieftains. A legitimate function of Chiefs was to aggrandize their dynasties and increase the territory and power of family members. Families of Chiefs sent their children (with the assistance of lower-rank rulers, as well as a large number and levels of advisers who for the most part also occupy their positions by virtue of their family or clan origins and status) to rule or act as security within neighbouring lands of friendly chieftains. This ensured trust in high ranking circles, non- contestation of seats enthroned to siblings in addition to other reciprocal obligations fulfilled by the families carrying out rituals on behalf of the communities. Such mechanisms ascertained that the chief does not rule arbitrarily. In the late 1800s there was a dispersal of the children/grandchildren of Mfalikuivahaa to the outposts where each was said to have made his or her mark in the subsequent urbanization and consolidation of the alliance of chieftains with each child or grandchild fashioning his or her state after their origins.  Songea - Salubwiti Mfalikuivahaa  Salubwiti and Kamonga Mfalikuivahaa journeyed through Malawi and moved to the Ruvuma Region where Salubwiti Mfalikuivahaa remained to rule in the Namtumbo area while Kamonga Mfalikuivahaa travelled north-seeking land to locate his chieftain. Germans occupied the area around the Great Lakes region since 1897 completely altering many aspects of everyday life. They were actively supported by the missionaries who attempted to change all indigenous beliefs, notably by razing the 'mahoka' huts where the local population worshiped their ancestors' spirits and by scorning their rites, dances and other ceremonies.Songea, (Ruvuma) was the centre of African resistance during the Maji Maji Rebellion in German East Africa temporarily uniting a number of southern tribes.  Lubiki Lwamtwa, ‚Äòthe staff of a Chief‚Äô - Kamonga Mfalikuivahaa  Kamonga Mfalikuivahaa travelled to Utengule where he befriended and was welcomed by Chief Toigali Soliambingu of the Bena people. Kamonga Mfalikuivahaa was installed as head of the chieftain security. Historically, the family members of chiefs in the many kingdoms/ chieftains became soldiers and can trace their origins to military leaders from the migration period. The fundamental idea of a leader was that of essential superiority of the fighting man, usually maintained in the granting of arms. The spear was an outward and visible sign of a \\"leader and a hunter‚Äù. As the best friend of Chief Toigali, Kamonga was given the name Lubiki, ‚Äòthe staff of a Chief‚Äô as one is often found next to a Chief.  Settling in the Mngeta area  A tradition of Bena people included burying the Chief‚Äôs right-hand man with him, as an escort in the after life, upon the Chief‚Äôs death. Chief Toigali Soliambingi‚Äôs death lead Kamonga Mfalikuivahaa to flee the chieftain and finally settle in the Mngeta area (Kilombero District) where he instituted his own, clan seat, seat of the Chief. Practicing polygamy, Kamonga Mfalikuivahaa had forty wives yet only two children from two of his wives, Abiba Makwega and Joahali Makwega. Each of the Makwega sisters had a child, Mohammed and Mira Lubiki Kamonga Mfalikuivahaa . Kamonga Mfalikuivahaa died when his children were infants and his son Mohammed Lubiki grew up with his uncles in Mofu. Mohammed Lubiki went on to have four daughters and four sons with Mdasula Zaina Kitabu. Mohammed Lubiki Kamonga Mfalikuivahaa now referred to simply as Lubiki, inherited his father‚Äôs physical strength and was an exceptionally skilled hunter well known for having the house feeding the chieftain.  The ‚ÄòMfalikuivahaas‚Äô today  The Chiefs were suspicious of foreign missionary schools as they thought that a foreign product might prove to have evolved too suddenly in a different world discounting a general view that future constitutional development in Tanzania depended more on the Western educated elite than on the hitherto favoured traditional rulers. ‚ÄòMohammed‚Äô of Islamic inclinations as a result of the Arabization of much of the Tanganyikan population, calculating his sons would remain to rule in the region, only sent his four daughters to be stewarded by Sister Solana (Baldegger sisters, Order of Friars Minor Capuchin) in Ifakara. In the 1960s, East Africa‚Äôs nationalists set out to build independent states by dismantling tribes and chieftains. ‚ÄòA truly socialist state is one in which all people are workers and in which neither capitalism nor feudalism exists‚Äù. There followed the largest resettlement effort in the history of Africa: nearly 70 percent of Tanzania‚Äôs rural people were uprooted and settled in collective villages. Alongside the growth of nationalist movements among the educated elite and the organization of trade unions among workers, there was a disruption of chieftain family politics, a restructuring of ethnic identification, and a resort to modern solutions. Several members of the family are now educated abroad in Swiss private schools (alongside leaders including Kim Jong-un; the supreme leader of North Korea), the United Kingdom and United States.

Description and history The Creamery Covered Bridge is about west of downtown Brattleboro, just south of Vermont Route 9 and west (upstream) of the current alignment of Guilford Road, which it previously carried. The bridge is long and wide, and rests on stone abutments, one of which has been faced in concrete. The roadway is wide, and an attached sidewalk on the downstream side is wide. The bridge is topped by a roof that is slate over the roadway and metal over the sidewalk. The bridge trusses, built to the patented design of Ithiel Town, are protected by vertical board siding that rises about half their height, with a similar wall outside the sidewalk. Guy wires attached to the upstream side provide additional lateral support. The Route 9 facing end of the bridge. The bridge was built in 1879 out of spruce lumber, and the sidewalk was added about 1920.

It can now be seen as either a synonym of family Batrachedridae, or a monotypic subfamily of that family. Taxonomy and systematics Epimarptidae was first created as a monotypic family by Edward Meyrick in 1914 to house his new genus Epimarptis, with a single species from India.\\"Epimarptidae Meyrick, 1914\\" at Markku Savela's Lepidoptera and Some Other Life Forms. Retrieved May 18, 2017 Epimarptis remained monotypic until a second species was described from Sri Lanka by Meyrick three years later, although in this publication Meyrick decided to reclassify the genus in the family Epermeniidae, an interpretation he maintained in all his subsequent publications. Meyrick described his final third species from Assam in far eastern India in 1931. The genus remained encompassing three species from the Indian subcontinent until Kazuhiro Sugisima described a new species from Japan in 2004. Specimens of this moth had been collected numerous times since at least 1975, but had remained nameless up until then. The concept of the superfamily Gelechioidea had begun to crystallise in the late 1960s, and in 1986 Jo√´l Minet was the first to include the genus Epimarptis, unassigned to family, within this grouping. Minet resurrected the family Epimarptidae for the genus in 1990, and was followed in this by Sergey Yu. Sinev in 1992, but in 1998 Ron Hodges reclassified the family Epimarptidae as the subfamily Epimarptinae in the family Batrachedridae, based on a number of shared synapomorphies. In the 2003 book Microlepidoptera of Europe Sjaak J. C. Koster and Sergey Yu. Sinev chose to disregard Hodges, continuing to view the subfamily Batrachedrinae at the rank of family (Batrachedridae), but it is unclear where they place Epimarptis (which doesn't occur in Europe). In 2004 Lauri Kaila attempted to use cladistics to approximate the phylogeny of the superfamily Gelechioidea, using 193 morphological traits, and including Epimarptis. He lacked data for most of these morphological characters in Epimarptis, as the genus had not been seen again since Meyrick, let alone studied. Due to this incompleteness, he was obliged to exclude Epimarptis from much analysis, as depending on the most parsimonious consensus tree used, it might be classified as belonging to, or allied to, one of a number of different genera, which rendered a collapse of resolution in the basal clades of his Coleophoridae sensu lato. It was, however, clearly included in his Coleophoridae sensu lato, along with the family Coleophoridae sensu stricto, Hodges' subfamily Batrachedrinae and the genera Coelopoeta, Stathmopoda and perhaps Idioglossa. Kaila is careful to state that he was not formally revising Hodges' classification in his paper. When Sugisima published his new Epimarptis species a few months after Kaila's cladistic analysis, he attempted to fill in some of the missing morphological data in order to help resolve where the genus should be classified. However, the new data failed to give any more resolution, and in fact made the classification of Epimarptis within the Coleophoridae sensu lato possibly less certain, let alone whether it should be placed in the Batrachedridae or not. Sugisima mentions he finds the synapomorphies used by Hodges to define this latter family and its subfamilies in 1998 questionable in light of the further morphological observations made by him and Kaila. In Zhi-Qiang Zhang's 2011 attempt to list all the known animal species of Earth, van Nieukerken et al., the authors of the section on Lepidoptera, were aware of Hodges' 1998 work but chose to repudiate it, and re-recognised Epimarptidae as a family again. Four species in the genus Epimarptis were still counted as belonging to the family at the time. In 2014 work by Heikkil√§ et al. using cladistics essentially bolstered Hodges' 1998 viewpoint, synonymising this family with Batrachedridae. *Epimarptis Meyrick, 1914 **Epimarptis philocoma Meyrick, 1914  known from Mumbai, India **Epimarptis septicodes Meyrick, 1917  Maskeliya, central Sri Lanka **Epimarptis isoloxa Meyrick, 1931  Assam, India **Epimarptis hiranoi Sugisima, 2004  Honshu, Japan The new species Houdinia flexissima from New Zealand appears to be very similar and may be closely related to this group, along with two undescribed species from New Zealand and Australia. Hoare et al. classified the species in the family Batrachedridae, as opposed to the Epimarptidae, due to Kaila's 2004 statement regarding formally revising the classification, but it might properly be placed in the Epimarptidae, or at least the subfamily Epimarptinae sensu Hodges, depending on the taxonomy used. According to Sugisima it is very probable that many more new species within the genus have already been collected and many specimens await description whilst gathering dust in musea and collections in Japan and Europe. Ecology Almost absolutely nothing is known about the ecology of the family. Epimarptis hiranoi was mostly collected at low altitudes, E. philocoma presumably as well, but E. septicodes was collected at relatively high elevations. The moths all appear to be night-fliers. In E. hiranoi, imagoes are only known to fly from mid-June to mid-July, with a peak in the second quarter. The larvae of none of the species have ever been seen (or recognised as such), and the life histories or host plants of none of the species are known.

This counterbalanced the loss of Llangeler where Labour did not field a candidate. This was augmented by taking seven of the nine vacancies on the aldermanic bench. Boundary changes Two additional seats were created, at Burry Port and Felinfoel. Retiring aldermen The aldermen who retired at the election were ... Retiring Labour councillors Haydn Lewis and Evan Bevan stood down in Ammanford and Llandybie respectively to allow Aldermen Frank Davies, and D.B. Lewis to be returned unopposed. Likewise, H.H. Harries and J.H. Davies stood down in Llandissilio and Llansteffan in favour of Edward James and T.Ll. Harries. Aldermen John Phillips (Cwmamman) and J.D. Rees (St Clears) withdrew at the last moment. Unopposed returns 34 members were returned unopposed, which included both rural and urban seats. Contested elections 25 seats were contested, including a number of instances where rival Independents fought each other. As in 1949, Independents sought to fight elections in Llanelli as a group, but had little success. Following the elections, Labour held all nine wards in Llanelli town for the first time. A number of retiring aldermen stood as candidates and were returned unopposed. In Carmarthen, Alderman William Edwards, a member of the Council since 1928, stood in a town ward rather than in Llangunnor which he represented as a councilor until 1946. Edwards was defeated by the retiring Labour member. Summary of results This section summarises the detailed results which are noted in the following sections.

It has been suggested that during the Anglo-Saxon Period and during the Danelaw, St Martin was considered to be the patron saint of Lincoln. The church is likely to have been associated with the rare St Martin silver pennies minted in Lincoln, probably before 918 A.D, when Lincoln was taken back from the Danes by the Anglo-Saxons. History The church stood at the top of Lincoln High Street in the downhill area of Lincoln, before the land rises steeply to 'uphill' Lincoln, which is dominated by Lincoln Cathedral. In the Medieval period the area around St Martin‚Äôs church was the commercial centre of Lincoln and it stood very close to the Norman Jew's House and Jews Court. The church was largely destroyed in the English Civil War in 1643 and left as a ruin until 1739-40 when it was rebuilt in a Georgian style. This is the church that was recorded by the artist Samuel Hieronymus Grimm around 1784. About 1812 a new aisle was added to the church by the Lincoln architect William Hayward. Then in 1873, it was suggested that the whole of the church should be demolished to make way for a larger church. Due to the intervention of the Mayor of Lincoln, the tower, which was a prominent landmark on the Lincoln skyline was saved until it was demolished in about 1930. Much of the decorative stonework from the demolished church was used in the new church of St Andrew in Canwick road which was built in 1876-7,Pevsner N & Harris J, (1964), The Buildings of England: Lincolnshire, Penguin. pg.142. but this church was demolished in 1970.‚ÄùAntram‚Äù(1985), p. 495 St Martin‚Äôs Church was rebuilt in 1873 in West Parade at the corner with Orchard Street by the architect A S Beckett.Pevsner N & Harris J, (1964), The Buildings of England: Lincolnshire, Penguin. p.144. An application was made to demolish the replacement church in 1966 and after a legal hearing the building was demolished in 1970. Today, only the graveyard, which lies between St Martin‚Äôs Lane and Garmston Street remains. The graveyard has been paved with some of the grave-slabs from the old church. Surviving objects from the churchChurch Silver= Communion Cup of St Martin's, Lincoln, 1569, in Lincoln Cathedral Treasury Surviving objects from the church included the communion plate which consisted of three communion cups silver with paten covers and two silver flagons.Pevsner N & Harris J, (1964), The Buildings of England: Lincolnshire, Penguin. pg.144 One of these cups with a paten cover made by an unknown maker with initial 'A' and hallmarked in London in 1569, is now on display in the Lincoln Cathedral Treasury. =Monument to Sir Thomas Grantham= Tomb of Sir Thomas Grantham 1630 The lion on which Sir Thomas's feet rest The Grantham family were an important and long established family in the parish, who occupied the prebendal house of St Martin's on the High Street. The family monuments were in the north aisle of the chancel of the church. Of these monuments, one was a particularly fine Renaissance monument to Sir Thomas Grantham ( died 1630) and his first wife Frances (Puckering)(died 1610). Sir Thomas was an M.P for Lincoln and Lincolnshire. This monument is now in the church of St Mary le Wigford, Lincoln. The tomb, which now lacks its canopy, is made from alabaster sourced from Nottingham, and is likely to be the work of the noted sculptor Maximilian Colt\\"Antram\\" (1989), 498 The tomb has had a very chequered history. When Edward James Willson visited the church in 1807 he found the canopy had fallen and broken the faces of the recumbent figures. It was later moved into the church tower. In 1889 a Mr Justice Grantham, who claimed to be a descendant, removed the tomb without permission to Barcombe in Sussex. The remaining fragments of the effigies were reclaimed and placed in St Benedict's Church Lincoln, where in 1956 Sir Francis Hill says that the mutilated fragments lay after unseemly neglect and ill-usage.Hill, JW F (1956), Tudor and Stuart Lincoln, Cambridge University Press, pp114-115Grave slab of the Rev Francis Harvey and John Harvey in St Martin's churchyard in Lincoln Sometime before 1985 the tomb chest and fragments were reassembled in St Mary le Wigford and this was recorded by the Church Monuments Society.Church Monuments Society. However, subsequently more of the figures have re-appeared including the lion on which Sir Thomas rests his feet, and the figures have been re-arranged. =Grave slab in St Martin‚Äôs Churchyard to the Rev Francis Harvey and John Harvey.= Among the grave slabs now used as paving in St Martin's Churchyard is a fine memorial slab to the Rev Francis Harvey who died aged 29 years in 1711, and John Harvey who died in 1758. The grave slab is carved in cameo lettering on a black marble slab with the family coat of arms above. There are two very similarly carved black marble slabs, the source of which is yet to be identified, in the east end of the chancel of Lincoln Cathedral. These distinctive grave slabs were presumably produced in a local workshop. Details of Francis Harvey are given in Alumni Cantabrigienses. He was the son of Francis Harvey of Lincoln and went to school at Newark. He became a fellow of Magdalene College, Cambridge in 1708.  he clearly was not the Francis Harvey who died in 1732 and was the Vicar of Lawshall in Suffolk, as indicated in this entry. The St Martin of Lincoln silver Penny St Martin of Lincoln silver penny c.918 A.D These very rare silver coins were minted in Lincoln shortly before the end of Danish rule. The obverse of the coin has a sword and is crudely lettered Sancti Marti and on the reverse is a cross and is lettered Civit Lincolia, for Lincoln. It has been argued that at this time St Martin was the patron saint of Lincoln and that these coins were minted in the vicinity of St Martin's church, the main commercial centre of Lincoln then.Stewart I. (1967) The St Martin Coins of Lincoln British Numismatic Journal, Vol.36, pp46‚Äì54. Currently about 14 examples of these coins are known and one from the Sir Francis Hill collection is in the Usher Gallery. A particularly fine specimen of a St Martin penny was found in the Vale of York Hoard in 2006.

Career controversies Joseph Newman applied for a patent on his \\"energy machine\\" in 1979, which was rejected by the US Patent and Trademark Office as a perpetual motion machine.

The NBS concluded that Newman's machine did not reach or exceed 100% efficiency as Newman claimed, and declared the patent as unrewardable.

The union was founded in 1858 at the White Bear Inn in Barnsley in response to a planned wage cut, with Richard Mitchell appointed a few weeks later as its secretary. Following the formation of the union, colliery owners agreed not to impose cuts, but at the Oaks Colliery, the owner refused to re-employ union members. Following a lengthy strike, they were taken back, although they had to draw lots with blackleg workers for the seams of coal they had been working. Several more disputes took place over the next few years, the most important in 1859 at Wharncliffe Silkstone Colliery, where workers succeeded in keeping an elected checkweighman, John Normansell. The union took part in national conferences of miners in Leeds and Ashton-under- Lyne in 1858 and 1859, but these did not lead to any lasting national union. They did agree to send a delegation to Parliament, with Mitchell as its secretary, which succeeded in getting the Mines Regulation Act 1860 passed. This permitted all miners to demand that they elect a checkweighman, although in practice this right was rarely recognised by employers. The Miners' National Association was finally established in 1863, with the strong support of the SYMA, and with Mitchell as its secretary. In 1864, miners at the Oaks went on strike, asking for a month's advance of wages. This was without the sanction of the union and they did not initially receive any union benefits. However, many other colliery owners feared that the demand would spread, and pre-empted this by locking out miners across the district. This lasted for nineteen weeks, during which Normansell took the lead in maintaining solidarity. At this point, the owners reopened their mines, re-employing the miners under their former pay and conditions, although the Oaks held out until December. This action was considered a success for the union, and membership rose to 2,279. The SYMA was reorganised under the new leadership of Normansell, introducing standard procedures across all branches, and successfully promoting the election of checkweighmen across the district. With his assistant Philip Casey, they rebuilt membership to over 20,000, and began running annual South Yorkshire Miners' Galas.Dictionary of Labour Biography, vol.I, p.256 The union was also a prominent founder of the UK Association of Organised Trades, loaning it money on several occasions. Financial aid was frequently sent to other miners' unions involved in disputes, and local trade unions in other industries. In 1874, new offices were opened in Barnsley. In 1860, miners at Brightside in Sheffield formed a union and, in November, joined the SYMA, as its first branch in the city. However, they were then victimised by their employer and the branch collapsed. It was only re- established in 1866, when miners in Tinsley also joined, the union prioritising bringing their working conditions up to the standards enjoyed in the rest of the district. This was fiercely resisted by some mineowners, and led to an eighteen-month strike in 1869/70 which spread across the district, with the union successful at some pits but entirely defeated at others. The union long co-operated with the Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire Miners' Association, but this was largely defeated by 1868. As a result, the SYMA began building up branches in north Derbyshire. However, membership remained low in the district, and the SYMA leadership had little time to deal with disputes there, so little activity took place. In 1880, lodges in the county split away to form the new Derbyshire Miners' Association. Wages increased rapidly during the early 1870s, but from 1874 coal prices began falling, and wages were cut. Normansell was criticised by some miners for not doing more to oppose this, and resigned in 1875 in protest. He was replaced by John Frith, who invested much of the SYMA's capital in the Shirland Colliery, but lost this when the pit went into liquidation in 1877. Soon after, most of its members in Derbyshire left to form the Derbyshire Miners' Association. The SYMA began negotiating a merger with the West Yorkshire Miners' Association; this was completed in 1881, forming the new Yorkshire Miners' Association.Dictionary of Labour Biography, vol.I, p.126 Secretaries :1858: Richard Mitchell :1864: John Normansell :1875: John Frith References Defunct trade unions of the United Kingdom Mining trade unions Politics of Yorkshire Mining in Yorkshire 1858 establishments in England Trade unions established in 1858 1881 disestablishments Trade unions disestablished in the 1880s ","title":"South Yorkshire Miners' Association"},{"id":"48567843","text":"A learning relationship management (LRM) software system manages and facilitates student-led instruction to maximize student engagement, achievement, outcome and long-term success (allows learners to assemble and manage their own sociotechnical system).

It originated in a weather disturbance that formed on October 14 in the southern Bay of Bengal, off India's east coast. Moving westward, it struck Andhra Pradesh on October 17 as a well-defined low pressure area. It crossed southern India and reorganized in the Arabian Sea off the western coast of India. The system developed into a depression on October 22 and quickly intensified while moving northward. By October 24, the cyclone approached hurricane intensity as it developed an eye, reaching peak winds of at least 110 km/h (70 mph). On October 25, the storm abruptly stalled and weakened off Gujarat, and progressed southwestward as a minimal storm. It was no longer classifiable as a tropical cyclone by October 28, although its remnants persisted until November 2 when they dissipated east of Somalia. In southern India, the storm dropped heavy rainfall that caused severe flooding in Andhra Pradesh. At least 112 reservoirs and dams were breached, killing 200 people in Prakasam district. The floodwaters ruined about of crops and damaged around 53,000 houses, leaving thousands homeless. The floods killed 388 people in southern India and caused US$388 million in damage. The storm later brushed the west coast of India, stranding 50 boats. The Indian military helped with relief and rescue efforts. Another cyclone struck Andhra Pradesh in November, causing additional damage and deaths. Meteorological history The long-tracked storm originated from the monsoon trough, which spawned an area of convection, or thunderstorms, in the southern Bay of Bengal on October 14\\\\. It moved to the west-northwest and later to the west without much development. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) classified the system as a well-marked low pressure area before the system moved over the southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh on October 17\\\\. The system slowly crossed southern India, emerging into the Arabian Sea on October 21\\\\. That day, the convection organized into a circular cluster as the circulation became more defined. The system slowed and turned to the north around the periphery of a ridge to the east. The system organized into a depression on October 22, the same day that the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) classified it as Tropical Cyclone 05A. As the storm moved slowly northward, it quickly intensified, and the IMD upgraded the system's status from a depression on October 22 to severe cyclonic storm status late on October 23\\\\. Around that time, the storm developed an eye, and the JTWC estimated 1 minute peak winds of 120 km/h (75 mph) at 18:00 UTC that day, equivalent to a minimal hurricane. On October 24, the IMD estimated peak 3 minute winds of 110 km/h (70 mph), although estimates derived from the Dvorak technique suggested winds of 120 km/h (75 mph). On October 25, the storm stalled about 95 km (60 mi) south of the Gujarat coast, as steering currents from the retreating ridge of high pressure diminished. Strengthening wind shear, cooler waters, and dry air rapidly weakened the storm. By late on October 25, the JTWC had discontinued warnings, and the IMD downgraded the storm to depression status. The system began moving to the southwest away from the wind shear. The IMD downgraded the system further to a remnant low on October 28, although the JTWC began issuing advisories again after a nearby ship reported winds of 65 km/h (40 mph). Accelerating to the west, the storm again weakened on October 31, prompting the JTWC to discontinue advisories while the system was about 110 km (70 mi) northeast of Socotra. The remnants turned to the southwest, dissipating near the east coast of Somalia on November 2. The JTWC remarked that the storm \\"had one of the most unusual tracks in North Indian Ocean cyclone history\\" and was also one of the longest tracked cyclones in the basin. According to the IMD, most storms approaching Gujarat strike the coast or weaken and move westward. The agency stated that \\"there is no parallel of this system in [tropical cyclone history].\\" Impact and aftermath The precursor to the storm brought heavy rainfall to southern India, mainly in Andhra Pradesh, as well as in Tamil Nadu to the south, Karnataka to the west, and Kerala to the southwest. Daily totals reached in portions of Andhra Pradesh, where damage was heaviest. The rains flooded rivers and cities, with thousands of residents in Hyderabad stranded in their houses. About 40 villages were isolated in Kadapa district. Throughout the region, the storm damaged 53,000 houses. About 86,000 people sought shelter after the storm, and thousands were left homeless. Highways and railroads were inundated, with many bridges washed away. At least 112 reservoirs and dams were breached. The floods also damaged about 1,600,000 ha (3,953,000 acre) of crop fields - 450,000 ha (1,111,000 acre) of rice and 1,150,000 ha (2,842,000 acre) of ground nuts - and killed about 45,000 head of cattle. At least 200 people were killed in the Prakasam district after reservoirs were damaged. In Tamil Nadu, south of Andhra Pradesh, at least 10 people were killed, all in Chennai. Overall, 388 people died in southern India due to the floods, including at least 326 in Andhra Pradesh. Damage was estimated at US$128.5 million, of which US$120 million was in Andhra Pradesh. After the floods, helicopters airlifted relief supplies like food and water to isolated villages, and to residents riding out the floods on their roofs. However, relief coordination was disrupted by damaged communication lines and ongoing rainfall. Rescue boats were used to rescue stranded residents. India's Prime Minister H. D. Deve Gowda provided 500 million rupees (US$15 million) to help Andhra Pradesh with flood recovery. Conditions returned to normal within 12 days of the onslaught of the rains, with the exception of minor delays to trains. However, another cyclone struck Andhra Pradesh about three weeks after the flood event, killing over 1,000 people. Upon forming and moving parallel to India's west coastline, the storm dropped rainfall in the Konkan region of Maharashtra and neighboring Goa. The threat of the storm prompted schools to be closed around Mumbai. Later, it brushed Gujarat with heavy rainfall and gusty winds. About 50 boats were stranded amid high seas, and 11 other boats were left missing from the Veraval port. During the height of the storm, 320 fishermen were unaccounted for, spurring the Indian navy to launch search and rescue missions.

The temple is constructed in Rock-cut architecture by the Pallava king Mahendravarman I (600-630 CE) during the 7th century. The cave temple had later additions from the Chola and Vijayanagar Empire. One of the pillars has a sculpture of Nataraja, believed to be the earliest representation of the deity in South India. The temple has a small three-tiered rajagopuram, the entrance tower. The temple is declared as a heritage monument and administered by the Archaeological Survey of India as a protected monument. The other side of the hillock houses the Jain beds established in the 9th century during the reign of Ganga King Rajamalla II. History Stambeswarar temple was built during the reign of Pallava king Mahendravarman I (600-630 CE) during the 8th century. It is one of the earliest representations of Rock-cut architecture. The place is called Avanibhajana Pallaveshwaram temple as Avani is one of the titles of King Mahendravarman. Though the image of the lions in the pillars lead to an assumption that the temple might have been possibly been initiated by Simhavishnu, the father of Mahendravarman, the view is not accepted. The inscriptions, accounted in Epigrahia Indica, is written in Sanskrit with Grantha-Pallava alphabet. The inscriptions indicate that it was dug out by Lalitankura, which is similar to that of cave temple in Tiruchirapalli Rock Fort indicating Mahendravarman. The temple had later additions from the Chola and Vijayanagar Empire. The gopuram, the gateway tower is believed to be an addition by the Vijayanagar kings. The other side of the hillock houses the Jain beds established in the 9th century during the reign of Ganga King Rajamalla II. Architecture The temple has a three-tiered rajagopuram a set of scattered shrines. The shrine of Stambeswarar is housed in the circular sanctum in a rock cut cave. There is a large pillared hall and narrow pillared Ardhmandapam leading to the cave sanctum. The shrine for Nadi is located outside the pillared hall axial to the central shrine. The sanctum is guarded by two Dvarapalas, the guardian deities. The sanctum houses the image of Shiva in the form of lingam. In the pillars, lotus is carved on the upper portion, while images of lion is seen in the lower half. The presiding deity is called Thoonandavar or Stambeswarar on account of the presence of two pillars in front of the temple. One of the pillars in the temple has one of the earliest representations of Nataraja (the dancing form of Shiva) in Ananda Thandava posture. There are two attendants of Shiva ganas of Nataraja, with one of them playing Miruthangam (a percussion instrument) and other in praying posture. The pillared hall has images of yalis, the mythical creatures representative of Vijayanagar Art. The images of other attendant deities of Shiva are housed in smaller shrines around the sanctum. Natarja dance posture Sculpture of Nataraja Nataraja is the cosmic representation of Shiva's different dance forms. The temple has the earliest representation of Nataraja in sculpture. As per Hindu mythology, Shiva is a violent dancer and while he dances, a snake named Karkodaka winds in his legs, leading to Shiva performing the Bhujamgatrasa, the snake fight posture. The sculpture of Nataraja in the temple depicts the posture. Shiva is sported with four hands, with his one of the left hands showing dola hasta posture, parasu in the second left, Abhaya mudra (protecting posture) in the first right hand and fire in the second right hand. Archeologist Dr.R.Nagaswamy believes that the hooded snake at the foot of Nataraja is the proof of Bhujamgatrasa. It is believed that all forms of dance are derived from Natya Sastra by sage Bharatha and Mahendravarma's knowledge of delicate postures are exemplified in the sculpture. He also affirms that by the image Mahendra shows the connection between bhuja·πÖga trƒÅsita and that the dance of Nataraja, the cosmic form of Shiva leads to the Ananda. Worship and religious practices The temple is declared as a heritage monument and administered by the Archaeological Survey of India as a protected monument. Though it is an archaeological monument, the temple is active in worship practices, where the temple priests perform the puja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. The temple rituals are similar to that of other Shiva temples.

Ntusi is dominated by two large mounds and manmade scraped valley basins called, bwogero. Ancient by the time Hima herdsman grazed their cattle on the Bwera, the herdsman named the site \\"Ntusi\\" meaning, \\"the mounds\\", after the prominent earthworks. The archaeological record at Ntusi is unmistakable in the signs of intense occupation and activity and it represents the beginning of political complexity in this region of Africa.Reid, Andrew 1996 Ntusi and the Development of Social Complexity in Southern Uganda. In Aspects of African Archaeology. Edited by G. Pwiti and R. Soper. pp. 621-627. University of Zimbabwe Publications, Harare, Zimbabwe Bigo, another site with prominent earthworks, lies 13 km to the north of Ntusi. The mounds The two large mounds and the bwogero are the major earthworks at Ntusi. The mounds, named the male mound (Ntusi IV) and the female mound (Ntusi III), are both approximately forty meters in diameter with a depth of deposition measuring 4 meters. Excavations at the female mound revealed the mound had been used as a refuse dump for a significant period. Excavators uncovered broken grindstones, pottery, cattle bones, carbonized sorghum seeds, and other household refuse. The surface of the mound received period burnings in order to reduce pests and foul odors of rotting refuse. Radiocarbon dates for the mound are from the eleventh to the thirteenth century AD. Local agriculture has slowly encroached on the mound and leveled off its surfaces, so much so, that on the southwestern side the mound appears rise very little. Ntusi male mound excavations in 1988 showed that the buildup of the mound was more complicated than the 1921 Wayland and Ntusi III excavations had indicated. The excavated material remains were similar to those in the female mound, but in addition to the household debris, ornamental goods were recovered as well. The upper layers of the mound revealed carved ivory, ostrich eggshell beads, glass beads, and copper trade goods. Radiocarbon testing has dated the Male Mound to be contemporaneous with the Female Mound. In addition to the main mounds, many smaller mounds (approximately one meter high) are found throughout the site particularly in the area north of the bwogero. Bwogero Bwogero are wide scraped basins with surrounding upcast banks in the valley north of the male mound. Reid, who excavated the bwogero in 1991, estimated the volume of material removed in their creation at nearly 30,000 cubic meters. The valleys in and around Ntusi have high water tables and are thus damp or even marshy. Since there is no river at Ntusi, Sutton has argued that the bowgero were not designed earthworks. Rather, bwogero and the resulting upcast on the banks are a result of Ntusi residents digging down to the water table in order to bring water to the surface for their cattle to drink. Alternatively, or possibly secondarily, bwogero development may be a result of kaolin quarrying which was used as plaster. Geography Located in the Interlacustrine region of southwestern Uganda, Ntusi is dominated by an open rolling grassland called Bwera. The site is approximately 5 km north of the equator and receives 1100 mm of rain a year which makes the region drier than the forests to Ntusi's east and west. The temperatures in this area are high but are not excessive. With its fertile soils, it has enabled the cultivation of a variety of different ranges of crops, with bananas and finger millet are most important. Ntusi is 83 km northwest of Masaka which is west of Lake Victoria, one of the African Great Lakes. Ntusi lies along the main road that connects Mubende and Masaka. It is also 193 km away from Kampala, the capital city of the Republic of Uganda. Bacwezi The Bacwezi, are recognized to be historical characters, heroes, and spirits. Ntusi is associated with oral traditions of the Bacwezi, thus then linked with the construct of the Bacwezi Empire. The depressions of Bwogero are known as 'Wamara's bath' - an exceptionally powerful chwezi spirit who is sometimes represented as a king. This is an example of the common tendency around the world to attribute prehistoric features of unknown date to people in recorded history, legend, or myth. Though assumed to be associated, there is no real evidence to support this. Research Eric Lanning and Gervase Mathew investigated Ntusi Hill in the 1950s. The Ntusi female mound was excavated by Combe of the Uganda Geological Survey in 1922 and again in 1987 by the British Institute in Eastern Africa (BIEA) with the Uganda Antiquities. The Ntusi male mound was investigated by Wayland in 1921. Wayland's shaft cutting was relocated by Andrew Reid in 1988 during the BIEA campaign. Reid excavated the western side of the mound, giving researchers a profile of the center and edge of the male mound. The radiocarbon dates from Ntusi are from 1000 to 1400 AD. Archaeological results suggest increasing political, social and economic complexity. Increased competition over agricultural land is suggested by Peter Robertshaw when he tentatively recognized shifts in settlement patterns. Archaeological features There are over 50 small sites. The slopes around Ntusi are blessed with thicker and fertile soil able to grow banana groves, sweet potatoes, maize, beans, groundnuts etc. This cultivation reveals archaeological evidence that comes to the surface like broken pots, food-bones, and grindstones. Farming threatens the archaeological features but the community at Ntusi have come up with a strategy to preserve the features as much as possible along with respecting the values of the community. Yet, the archaeological features have reduced in size. The largest archaeological features include two mounds and the bwogero basin. The mounds have suffered lowering through cultivation. The 'Ntusi male' and 'Ntusi female' are exceptionally large and are the most known. They are preserved as grass-covered eminences standing 4 meters above the surrounding fields and banana groves.  Importance  Linguistic research suggests that about 1000 years ago the farming societies early on in the region were changing as cattle and bananas increased in importance.The broken pottery, grindstones, curved iron knives, and animal bones of mostly young cattle make Ntusi the most valuable archaeological site in Uganda for the time around 1000 years ago. There was also evidence for iron working coming from beads made from ostrich eggshell, fragments of ivory, traces of circular houses, glass, and cowrie-shell beads indicating contact with the Indian Ocean. This suggests that people who lived at Ntusi seem to have been herding cattle and cultivating between a cattle-keeping elite and commoners. The lack of large sites suggests that Ntusi was a chiefdom and not yet developed into a centralized state.

The defenders were also armed with pikes and native-made hand cannons. These defenses were intended for use against pirates, however they also proved successful in driving away the fleet of Satsuma during their 1609 invasion, where Yarazamori proved pivotal. The castle would continue to be used for anti-piracy, however it became generally used for seeing ships off by civilians. Originally, the castle was built in the middle of the water, with a long causeway connecting it to the mainland. Over time however, land became deposited between the causeway and the land to the south until the causeway served as the coast. After the 1945 Battle of Okinawa, the United States established the southern shore of Naha Port as a naval base. As part of expanding the base, Yarazamori Castle was demolished in 1950.

General information  DB DMUs 611 508 in Nuremberg Class 611, successor to the DB Class 610, was developed using tilting systems from German military technology in favour of the Hydraulic Fiat systems used by its predecessor Because of environmental concerns over the potential hazards of leaking hydraulic fluid an electrically-actuated option based on equipment used to keep the guns of tanks level while traversing uneven terrain was used. The Class 611 suffered teething troubles following its entry into service just two years after the contract was awarded and was largely considered a failure. However, 40 are still in use as of November 2015.  Tilting technology issues  The trains came into service in 1996 and by March 1997 the first problems with the tilting technology occurred. The Federal Railway Authority limited the Class 611 to 120 km/h and required the tilting technology to be disabled, this was only reversed in May 1999 when they were satisfied the issues had been resolved. The tilting was disabled again in August 2004 when cracks were found in the 611's successors wheel sets, the DBAG Class 612, during ultrasound examinations of the axles. Tilting was disabled and speed limits on curved tracks were reduced until 2006 when the problematic wheel sets were replaced. However further issues were experienced and in October 2009, the tilting technology was disabled once again. Since April 3, 2011, Class 611 trainsets have been used in Baden-W√ºrttemberg with tilting technology enabled once more.

Holtzclaw was convicted of eighteen counts involving eight different women. According to the police investigators, Holtzclaw abused his position as an officer by running background checks to find information that could be used to coerce victims into sex. During the trial, the defense questioned the victims' credibility during cross-examination, bringing up their criminal records. Of the thirteen women who accused Holtzclaw, several had criminal histories such as drug arrests, and all of them were African American. The prosecution argued that victims were deliberately chosen by Holtzclaw for these reasons. Holtzclaw pleaded not guilty to all charges. On December 10, 2015, he was convicted on 18 of 36 charges, and on January 21, 2016, he was sentenced to 263 years in prison. Holtzclaw has maintained his innocence. On August 1, 2019, Holtzclaw was denied an appeal by the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals, which upheld both his convictions and prison sentence. The defense petitioned the Supreme Court of the United States on the basis that merging seventeen cases together \\"strains credulity.\\" On March 9, 2020, the Supreme Court refused the petition. Early life Daniel Holtzclaw was born December 10, 1986, in the U.S. territory Guam to Eric Holtzclaw and Kumiko Holtzclaw, who is Japanese. His father is a lieutenant with the Enid Police Department, approximately north of Oklahoma City. Holtzclaw graduated from Enid High School in 2005. While there he played football as a linebacker, setting a school record for 25 tackles in a game. He played linebacker at Eastern Michigan University, where he graduated with a degree in criminal justice in 2010. After graduating, Holtzclaw unsuccessfully attempted to get drafted into the NFL. Following that, he joined the Oklahoma City Police Department. Criminal charges and conviction=Charges Holtzclaw was accused of sexually assaulting multiple African American women over the period between December 2013 and June 2014, targeting those from a poorer, majority black portion of the city. According to the police investigators, Holtzclaw ran background checks on women with outstanding warrants or other criminal records, and methodically targeted those victims. The offense that led to Holtzclaw's arrest happened around 2:00 a.m. on June 18, 2014, after Holtzclaw had already completed his shift on the northeast side of Oklahoma City and was driving to his residence in his assigned police vehicle. During that time, police said, Holtzclaw made a traffic stop without reporting to police dispatch, running a records check on the driver, or revealing that he logged off of his patrol car computer. The driver was Jannie Ligons, a 57-year-old woman who was passing through the impoverished area that police said Holtzclaw was targeting. Unlike other women that police said he had accosted, she was not poor and had no police record. Ligons said that before forcing her to perform oral sex on him, Holtzclaw made her lift her shirt and pull down her pants. She testified that she had begged him to stop and was afraid for her life. Ligons promptly filed a police report. When Holtzclaw reported to the OKCPD Springlake Division station the following afternoon for his daily 4 p.m. to 2 a.m. shift, he was pulled aside and driven to the department's Sex Crimes Unit by detectives Kim Davis and Rocky Gregory for questioning. After being Mirandized, Holtzclaw underwent a two-hour interrogation during which he denied all accusations of misconduct during the Ligons stop earlier that morning, and buccal swabs were taken for DNA comparison. At the conclusion of the interrogation, the two detectives told Holtzclaw that they believed that he was being untruthful based both on previous evidence and on statements made by Kerri Hunt, his 25-year-old cohabiting girlfriend, that countered claims Holtzclaw had made to the detectives. While he was released after the interrogation, Holtzclaw's commission and entry cards, uniform shirt and pants, badges, firearms (handgun and shotgun), radio, and keys to his assigned police vehicle were seized, and he was placed on indefinite paid administrative leave. After further investigation eventually turned up a dozen additional complainants, Holtzclaw was arrested two months later on August 21, 2014, and originally charged with 16 (and eventually 36) counts of sexual abuse offenses including rape in the first and second degrees, sexual battery, procuring lewd exhibition, stalking, and forcible oral sodomy. While reviewing Ligons' case, the two sex-crimes detectives remembered a previous report of forced oral sex committed by a police officer. Looking back through police records, the detectives found the report of a woman who said she was stopped in May 2014 and driven to an isolated area by an officer who forced her to perform oral sex. No action had been taken at the time of her report, but when the detectives contacted the woman, she showed them the route that the officer had taken on the night of the attack, and it matched Holtzclaw's GPS route that evening. The detectives then reviewed Holtzclaw's automatically recorded history of running names through the department's two databases, looking specifically for people who had been checked out multiple times, and they contacted those women. In the initial investigation, six women were willing to come forward to testify, and the GPS device on Holtzclaw's patrol car put him at the scene of the alleged incidents. Police records showed that he had called in for a warrant check on all of them. Their investigation covered a six-month period, beginning with the first woman who was willing to come forward, a woman whom Holtzclaw arrested for drug possession in December 2013 and then forced oral sodomy from while she was handcuffed to a hospital bed. Accusations of sexual assault and rape Eventually, the police investigation brought together 13 women who were willing to testify; published reports did not include information on any possible further women who were not willing to testify. The earliest incident discovered was from December 20, 2013, where a woman said she had been arrested for drug possession, was hospitalized, and was forced to give oral sex while she was handcuffed to her hospital bed. She said that he again made sexual advances to her on several occasions after she was released from jail. The woman said that she was led to believe that she would be released if she performed oral sex on Holtzclaw. \\"I didn't think that no one would believe me,\\" she testified at a pretrial hearing. \\"I feel like all police will work together.\\" On February 27, 2014, Holtzclaw allegedly pulled up to a woman who was sitting in a parked car outside her house, fondled the woman's breasts, and told her, \\"I'm not going to take you to jail. Just play by my rules.\\" She said he returned to her home repeatedly and broke into it once. At his trial she said she did not notify the police because she did not believe anyone would believe her because \\"I'm a black female.\\" *March 14, 2014: Holtzclaw stopped a woman who was walking to a friend's house, asked her whether she was in possession of any drugs, and forced her to expose her breasts. *April 24, 2014: Holtzclaw stopped a woman who was engaging in sex work. He drove her home and when they arrived he forced her to perform oral sex and then raped her. *April 25, 2014: Holtzclaw pulled a woman over saying he was taking her to detox in jail; he instead drove her to a field and raped her, leaving her there after he was done. *May 7, 2014: Holtzclaw stopped a woman while she walked to her cousin's house. After finding out she had some warrants, he forced her to perform oral sex and then raped her behind an abandoned school. *May 8, 2014: According to a later investigation, \\"A woman, known in court documents as T.M., reported that an unidentified officer forced her to perform oral sex after he found a crack pipe in her purse. Although she filed a police report later that month, no connection was made to Holtzclaw at the time.\\" *May 21, 2014: Holtzclaw drove a woman to a secluded area and gave her an ultimatum: sex or jail. She performed oral sex on him and then he raped her. In an interview the woman said that she first thought it was a \\"cruel joke of some hidden-camera show\\" until she realized that he was serious. She said she \\"had been jailed many times before, and knew the math: a 15-minute ride downtown, two hours to be booked, up to a day of waiting to move to a cell, hearings drawn out over weeks or months,\\" and then decided to give in to his demands, which she figured would only take about six minutes. *May 26, 2014: Holtzclaw stopped a woman and touched her breasts and put his hand in her pants. The woman said she did not tell the police because she didn't think she'd be believed. *June 17, 2014: According to an investigation, \\"A 17-year-old female is first stopped by Holtzclaw when he arrives to investigate a verbal dispute between two of her friends. Later, he tracks her down while she is walking home, threatens to arrest her for an outstanding warrant, and then takes her to her mother's house, where he forces her to perform oral sex and have intercourse with him on the enclosed porch.\\" *June 18, 2014: Around 2:00 am, Holtzclaw had an encounter with a 57-year-old grandmother, Jannie Ligons, who would ultimately be the one to spark the investigation. The final sexual incident occurred on the same day as the encounter reported by Ligons. According to testimony, Holtzclaw stopped a woman as she left a hotel where she had been staying with her boyfriend. After running a check on her he took her to a desolate area and raped her. She told her boyfriend about the attack and he told her that she should report the rape to the police. \\"He is the police\\", she responded. *November 2014: In November three more victims came forward, bringing the total to 13. Previously unidentified DNA which had been found on Holtzclaw's pants was found to match that of a 17-year-old girl who had come forward regarding the June 17 event. Another woman said she was walking on May 22 when Holtzclaw stopped her to check for warrants. When he found that there were no warrants out for her he said he would jail her if she didn't have sex with him; he then forced her to perform oral sex and raped her. A third woman said that he told her he was bringing her to detox but instead brought her to an isolated area and raped her. Ten more counts, including \\"first-degree rape, second-degree rape by instrumentation, forcible oral sodomy, and sexual battery\\" were filed against Holtzclaw, who was still on paid leave. Jury selection The final jury was an all-white jury which consisted of eight men and four women. Three black men were selected to the first pool of 24 potential jurors, but were eventually rejected. The president of the Oklahoma City chapter of the NAACP expressed disappointment in the lack of minority jurors. Trial Holtzclaw, who had been on paid administrative leave since he was charged in August 2014, was fired in January 2015 and his trial began on November 2, 2015. He faced 36 charges, including sexual battery, assault, forcible oral sodomy, and stalking, and pled not guilty to all charges. In court, prosecutors produced DNA evidence that was found on a triangle-shaped spot on the inside of Holtzclaw's uniform close to the zipper. After the hearing, his family made a statement that \\"The facts are that there is no DNA linking him to any of these women as far as was presented in the hearing.\\" According to The New York Times, however, the DNA did match one of the victims, then aged 17. The DNA that was found was skin DNA; Holtzclaw's DNA was not found in the same area of clothing where the 17-year-old accuser's skin DNA was found. Holtzclaw's defense attorney explained the presence of the skin cells as \\"secondary transfer\\" whereby Holtzclaw's hands had possibly come into contact with the woman's skin cells when he searched her purse and later transferred them to the zipper area of his pants. During the trial, Holtzclaw did not contest that he encountered the women, but he maintained his innocence. The defense concentrated on the accusers' lifestyles and called just one witness, a former girlfriend of Holtzclaw's who testified he never exhibited sexually aggressive or inappropriate behavior around her. On December 10, 2015, he was convicted on 18 of the charges, with the jury recommending that he serve 263 years in prison. Charges included first-degree rape, sexual battery, indecent exposure, stalking, forcible oral sodomy and burglary. He also faced second-degree rape by instrumentation and sexual battery charges. Claiming that evidence was withheld from the defense, Holtzclaw's attorney requested a new trial on January 20, 2016. The request was denied by the judge immediately. A statement released by Oklahoma City Police Chief Bill Citty reads, in part: \\"We are satisfied with the jury's decision and firmly believe justice was served.\\" Soon after his sentencing, all of Holtzclaw's information was removed from the Oklahoma Department of Corrections (DoC) website. The website shows data on a criminal's offense(s), mug shots, and jail location. When asked where Holtzclaw is currently located, DoC spokesperson Terri Watkins replied, \\"We are not going to comment, it is a matter of security.\\" It was later confirmed that he was being held under an alias in an undisclosed Oklahoma state prison. As of April 2020, the ODoC database lists Holtzclaw as being housed at the Lexington Assessment and Reception Center in Lexington, Oklahoma.Search results at Oklahoma Department of Corrections OK Offender database. Accessed April 3, 2020. \\"Offender: Daniel K. Holtzclaw OK DOC#: 731154 Status: ACTIVE\\"; \\"Current Facility: LARC-IC-OS\\" In a 2016 interview Holtzclaw reasserted his innocence.  Appeal process  In a unanimous opinion on August 1, 2019, the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals denied Holtzclaw's appeal. The ruling, written by Judge Dana Kuehn rejected the appellant attorneys' claims of insufficient evidence and also of improper procedure for bundling all 36 charges together. The opinion denigrated allegations of a \\"circus atmosphere,\\" noting that the jury returned not guilty verdicts on fully half of the charges. In his concurrence, Presiding Judge David B. Lewis referred to Holtzclaw as a \\"sexual predator.\\" In their public condemnation of the ruling, Holtzclaw's family and supporters called Lewis' description a \\"vicious and false assertion.\\" On March 9, 2020, Holtzclaw's petition for a writ of certiorari was denied by the Supreme Court of the United States. Media coverage According to The Atlantic, mainstream media gave Holtzclaw's trial for serial sexual attacks and rapes \\"relatively little\\" attention, although Black Lives Matter activists raised the matter in social media and helped bring attention to the ongoing judicial process. The Guardian reported that local activists were surprised that advocates from national women's groups, who had attended rape trials in the past, were absent from the courtroom at the start of the trial. Racial justice activists who had been very vocal about recent police-involved shootings were also accused of being largely absent from involvement in the Holtzclaw case. In the absence of national attention, two Oklahoma City women, Grace Franklin and Candace Liger, formed the group OKC Artists For Justice to bring attention to the case. They said that they began to organize when Holtzclaw's bail was reduced from $5 million to $500,000 because it was so \\"insulting and infuriating\\", that they \\"wanted to stand up and say 'No. This is not OK. You cannot let a man who attacked and raped 13 women, per the charges, go home and have Christmas dinner with his family while those women are still in fear.'\\" Franklin said that they reached out to many national groups but received little response. She said, \\"It kind of fuels the feeling of separation between black so-called feminists and white feminists. Why aren't there more women out here of all shades, of all backgrounds for these women? Why are we doing this alone?\\" An article in Cosmopolitan noted that the media consistently ignores the violence perpetrated against black women and girls as compared to the coverage given to white women and girls. The article concluded: > Mainstream media failed these women. The lack of coverage thwarted a > national conversation about sexual violence as a distinct form of police > brutality. The stories of these women need to serve as an important > intervention in conversations about anti-black state violence, rape culture, > and the vulnerability of sex workers, ex-offenders, and current and > recovering drug addicts to state and state-sanctioned violence. This verdict > and Holtzclaw's forthcoming sentencing are entry points for a more > thoughtful, humane, and transformative national dialogue about police > brutality and sexual violence. With or without mainstream media coverage, we > need to continue talking about this trial and everything it represents. Holtzclaw's case was part of an Associated Press report in a yearlong examination of sexual assaults by police. The report found that approximately 1,000 police officers lost their licenses for sex crimes during a six-year period. Reporting in the case indicates that this may be an undercount due to inconsistencies in how different jurisdictions deal with and report problem officers. In February 2016, website SB Nation published a lengthy profile of Holtzclaw that focused on his college football career. The piece was immediately criticized as being apologetic and sympathetic to Holtzclaw; it was pulled within hours of publication. SB Nation subsequently suspended and later permanently shut down its long-form journalism program and cut ties with the freelance author responsible. Columnist Michelle Malkin has written about the case, and has repeatedly argued that she believes Holtzclaw is innocent, saying that the forensic evidence backs his version of events, not the accuser's versions, and also that the investigators chose not to perform several tests she characterized as routine. Malkin debuted her first and second episodes of CRTV.com's Daniel in the Den on December 12, 2016 in Enid. Malkin released her film about the case, entitled Railroaded: Surviving Wrongful Convictions in 2017.

He was known for his efforts to prevent the vandalism of monuments in Cairo, Egypt, and in Paris, France. Often the destruction was done in the name of restoration, or of other improvements to the city. Life=Early years (1836‚Äì65) Arthur Rhon√© was born in Paris on 14 March 1836. He was the eldest child of a Catholic family that had a good income from the Anzin mines, which had been discovered by an ancestor. His father, L√©on Rhon√©, Master of Requests (ma√Ætre des requ√™tes) at the court of auditors, died prematurely in 1847. In November 1864 Rhon√© met Th√©odule Dev√©ria, conservator of the Egyptian antiquities in the Louvre. A month later Rhon√©, Dev√©ria and some friends sailed to Egypt, where he saw Alexandria, Cairo, Memphis, and the work on the Suez Canal by Ferdinand de Lesseps. This was Dev√©ria's third visit to Egypt, in which he made drawings and took photographs that were reproduced in an album of 77 plates. The party went on to the Holy Land, Damascus and Istanbul. The voyage made a great impression on Rhon√©. Work in France (1865‚Äì79) On his return to France in 1865 Rhon√© planned a major work with his companions on ancient Egypt with historical notes on the hieroglyphs, natural history and history of the pharaohs. He would provide a precise topography of Cairo with supporting maps and explanatory notes about the city's monuments. However, there were delays in starting the project, and his lack of professional status proved a drawback. A few months later he married Gabrielle Bertrand, daughter of the mathematician and academician Joseph Bertrand. Map from Rhon√©'s 1877 L'Egypte √† petites journ√©es : √©tudes et souvenirs In 1867 Rhon√© joined the newly created National Museum of Antiquities (Mus√©e des Antiquit√©s nationales) in Saint-Germain-en- Laye. He helped prepare a guide to the museum. He worked on a book about his memories of Egypt. The first volume, describing Cairo and its surroundings, appeared at the end of 1877. The second volume, which was to be about Upper Egypt, was never published. He helped Auguste Mariette as a voluntary assistant with the \\"Ancient Egyptian House\\" for the Exposition Universelle of 1878. He also helped subsidize de Lesseps' business in Egypt. Further work in Egypt (1879‚Äì82) At the start of 1879 Rhon√© returned to Egypt with a group of artist friends, and went on the Palestine. In Egypt he spent all his time on Cairo, to which he returned with Mariette. In October 1878 exceptionally high waters of the Nile had inundated the Mus√©e de Boulaq beside of the river. The building was damaged, the museum was closed, antiquities had to be packed in cases and many of the old papers were destroyed. This may have been when Rhon√© decided to alert Paris to the impact of the improvements by the Khedive Isma'il Pasha on the ancient city, which had been relatively undisturbed in 1865. Rhone did much to publicize the discoveries of Egyptology in articles in the Gazette des Beaux-Arts and Le Magasin pittoresque. He published photographs of the Boulaq museum and the archaeological excavations. He also wrote of the destruction in Cairo since his last visit. He detailed the \\"vandalisme restaurateur\\", the \\"vandalism of the restorer\\", on buildings such as the Mosque of Sultan al-Muayyad, a fifteenth century masterpiece. On 28 December 1880 a permanent archaeological mission was established in Cairo. Rhon√© did not acknowledge that the Ottomans had helped preserve the fabric of Cairo. In 1881 he wrote \\"the city of Cairo was still intact, at least in the sense that its monuments continued to fall quietly into ruin following the eternal way of the Orient; at least nothing was attempted in the way of works called 'improvement' and 'Restoration. Mosqu√©e du Sultan Kalaoun from L'Egypte √† petites journ√©es Rhon√© was concerned with the impact of Italian architects and builders, who undertook much of the construction in Cairo at the time, introducing what he called \\"Italian Gothic style\\" buildings. He argued that some of the principles of Eug√®ne Viollet-le-Duc should be followed, specifically that of respecting local building techniques. In restoration work, he agreed with Viollet-le-Duc about the need to understand the original context when a monument was built, and with William Morris about the need to respect and preserve all periods of a building. He used the Al-Hussein and Sayyida Zaynab mosques as examples of the damage done by insensitive restorers. A decree of 10 January 1881 charged Rhon√© with a mission to the East, particularly Egypt, to study Arab and Egyptian monuments. He immersed himself in the study of Cairo in the early 15th century, and traced the enclosure of the Fatimid palace in the heart of the old city. The orientalist Paul Ravaisse was impressed by Rhon√©'s innovative approach and valuable results, and in September 1881 arranged for Rhon√©'s mission to be extended by another year, this time with a small salary. In October 1881 Rhon√© returned to Cairo with his family for a nine-month stay in which he concentrated on ancient Egyptian remains, although he also studied the Arab monuments and the topology of Cairo. The Comit√© de Conservation des Monuments de l'Art Arabe (Commission for Conservation of Monuments of Arab Art) was established by decree of the Khedive on 18 December 1881, due in part to the pressure from Rhon√© and his friends. Later career (1882‚Äì1910) In the summer of 1882 Rhon√© refused an invitation to further extend his mission in Cairo. On his return to Paris Rhon√© became involved in preserving that city, attacking the changes being made by Georges-Eug√®ne Haussmann. He made one further trip to the East, when he visited Petra with Aug√© de Lassus. In 1884 he lost all sight in one eye, and could only see poorly with the other. Rhon√© published R√©flexions sur l‚Äôenlaidissement progressif des villes qu‚Äôon embellit (Reflections on the progressive disfiguration of cities by improvements) in 1889. In this work he denounced the treatment of ancient Parisian buildings and monuments, with removal of architectural elements that did not suit modern taste, addition of incongruous modern structures beside the old and destruction monuments by great boulevards. Arthur Rhon√© died in Paris on 7 June 1910.

Both became heavily involved in the local socialist and co-operative movements; Eleanor joined the Brightside and Carbrook Co-operative's Women's Co-operative Guild, and became secretary of its Hillsborough branch, then serving in succession on the district, Yorkshire and central committees of the Guild.

It flew successfully in 1929. Design and development Before the Storch V, Lippisch had designed only gliders, many of them tailless. The first of these, the Espenlaub E.2, was built by Espenlaub in 1922 but Lippisch, at RRG from 1925, did not return to the tailless layout until 1927. Development progressed with a series of the Storch models; with the Storch IV he achieved a fully controllable aircraft which flew well. The Storch V was essentially the Storch IV with a small pusher configuration engine added behind the pilot. The Storch V had a straight edged wing with about 17¬∞ of sweep on the leading edge and with only slight taper and dihedral. It was built around a plywood skinned D-box leading edge spar and a second spar near mid-chord and was fabric covered. Broad, lobate ailerons were hinged at right angles to the line of flight, protruding beyond the trailing edges and carrying small trim tabs not fitted to the Storch IV. Broad, low endplate fins and rudders of about equal area, cambered on their inner surfaces provided directional stability and control. Their profiles were lower and simpler than those on the Storch IV. The rudders could work together for steering and in opposition for braking. Each wing was braced from a single point on the lower fuselage pod longeron to nose and rear spars at about 40% span by a faired V-strut. There were a pair of sturdy, faired, vertical struts between the upper pod and the wing centre. The pod was flat sided, with angled upper and lower surfaces and on the Storch IV projected back almost to a line between the aileron trailing edges to provide some yaw stability. On the Storch V this provided a place to mount a small DKW air- cooled two-stroke engine in pusher configuration with its output shaft just lower than the wing. Enclosed within a humped, metal cowling, it proved difficult to cool, so it was generally run at less than full power. There was a landing skid under the pod which extended back past the end of the pod to protect the propeller. The date of the first flight of the Storch V is not known but it was active during 1929 and flew well despite its low engine power. It finally crashed whilst demonstrating at Darmstadt in gusty conditions.

He was suspected of having organized multiple terror attacks in Belgium and France, and is known to have masterminded the November 2015 Paris attacks. Prior to the Paris attacks, there was an international arrest warrant issued for Abaaoud for his activities in recruiting individuals to Islamic terrorism in Syria. Abaaoud was also known as Abu Omar Soussi (, meaning \\"Abu Omar the Susian\\", his Moroccan family's place of origin) and as Abu Omar al-Baljƒ´kƒ´ (, meaning Abu Omar the Belgian), both of which were noms de guerre. Early life Abdelhamid, one of six children, was born on 8 April 1987 in Anderlecht, a municipality of Brussels, Belgium. He was the son of Omar Abaaoud, who emigrated to Belgium from Morocco in 1975. Omar Abaaoud's first employment after emigration was in mining, before he was employed as a shopkeeper. Abaaoud grew up in Sint-Jans-Molenbeek, an area in Brussels where \\"the radical Salafist ideology has flourished among some young Muslims.\\" He attended the select in Uccle from 1999 to 2000. An article from 2015 said childhood friends claimed Abaaoud had smoked \\"a lot of cannabis\\" during his teenage years. Both Abaaoud and Salah Abdeslam were arrested during December 2010 for attempting to break into a parking garage, according to the lawyer representing Abaaoud. Abaaoud alone had spent time in at least three prisons, and had a number of arrests for assault, and other crimes. The nature of these latter crimes were not disclosed by his lawyer. For a time, sometime prior to 2013, Abdelhamid Abaaoud was involved in trading via employment with his father. In 2013, he recruited his then 13-year-old brother Younes to join him in Syria. They left for Syria on 19 January 2014, for which he was convicted of abduction, having been previously convicted of robbery. On 24 January 2018 during the trial of Jawad Bendaoud, the president of the court Isabelle Pr√©vost-Desprez announced the death of Younes in an Iraqi-Syrian zone. Earlier jihadist activities Abaaoud is reported to have joined a group within ISIL known as al-Battar Katiba, (the al-Battar Battalion) during the fight against Bashar al-Assad in 2013. He returned to Belgium by the end of the same year. In 2014, independent journalists √âtienne Huver and Guillaume Lhotellier visited the Syria‚ÄìTurkey border, where they obtained photos and video of Abaaoud's time in Syria. One portion of this material showed Abaaoud and others loading bloody corpses into a truck and trailer before Abaaoud grinned and told the camera: \\"Before we towed jet skis, motorcycles, quad bikes, big trailers filled with gifts for vacation in Morocco. Now, thank God, following God's path, we're towing apostates, infidels who are fighting us.\\" Within Syria, Abaaoud is known to have been active at Hraytan. A diary entry while there records: \\"Admittedly there is no joy in spilling blood, although it's nice to see, from time to time, the blood of the infidels\\". Analysis of a telephone call established Abaaoud was in contact with Mehdi Nemmouche during January 2014. Nemmouche, a Franco-Algerian jihadist, shot and killed four people at the Jewish Museum in Brussels on 24 May 2014. Belgian authorities suspect him of having helped to organize and finance a terror cell in Verviers. This cell was raided on 15 January 2015 and two members of the cell were killed. In an interview with Dabiq, the magazine of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS), Abaaoud bragged on social media about going to Belgium to lead the cell but escaped back to Syria, even being stopped by a police officer who compared him to a photo but did not identify him. In July 2015, following the Verviers raid, he was convicted in absentia and sentenced to twenty years in prison by a Belgian judge for organizing terrorism. In an interview with Dabiq magazine published February 2015, Abaaoud was reported to have made comments of his intention to fight persons of the Western world which he identifies as \\"the crusaders\\". Abaaoud was put under investigation as a possible link to four out of six attacks foiled in France since spring 2015. This included an attempted attack by at a church in Villejuif near Paris in April 2015, as well as the thwarted Thalys train attack, which occurred on 21 August 2015. According to a BBC report on 19 November 2015, after Abaaoud's death, France's Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve told reporters that he had received intelligence that Abaaoud passed through Greece on his return from Syria. It is unclear whether the Belgian had concealed himself among the thousands of migrants arriving in Greece before heading for other EU nations. Greek officials subsequently insisted that there was no evidence that Abaaoud had been in that country. Confirming that Abaaoud had left for Syria last year, Cazeneuve said no EU states had signalled his return. Paris attacks and death By 16 November 2015, French and Belgian security services were focused on Abaaoud, who they believed to have been the leader of the Paris attacks. On 18 November, French authorities conducted a raid that ended in the injury of five police officers, three deaths, and at least five arrests, although some reports later indicated eight. The raid took place in the suburb of Saint- Denis in north Paris, and targeted Abaaoud. He was later confirmed to be one of the three fatalities in the raid. The police were aware that Hasna Ait Boulahcen, a suspect in a drug ring investigation during which her telephone was tapped, also of Moroccan origin, was an associate of Abaaoud. They followed her to a Saint-Denis apartment building at 8 Rue Corbillon on 17 November and saw Abaaoud entering with her. This was the building where the subsequent raid started at 4:20 am on 18 November. The prosecutor's office said that Abaaoud's body was found in the apartment that had been targeted in the raid and that the identification was made using skin samples, according to some published reports. However, other reports referred to identification by fingerprint samples taken from Abaaoud's mutilated body which had been riddled with bullets and bits of shrapnel from a grenade explosion. Abaaoud's fingerprints were found on an AK-47 rifle found in an abandoned car. According to French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve, Abaaoud had \\"played a decisive role\\" in the Paris attacks and played a part in four of six terror attacks foiled since spring of 2015, with one alleged jihadist claiming Abaaoud had trained him personally. The French prosecutor also stated on 24 November that Abaaoud was planning another attack in La D√©fense, a major business district in the Paris Metropolitan Area. West Midlands Police also recovered nearly 50 video clips and digital photographs from his phone. Among the photos were those of the Bull Ring shopping centre in Birmingham and other locations in the city. Abaaoud had visited the United Kingdom in August 2015. He arrived at Dover by ferry despite being hunted by Belgian authorities. Connections to other jihadists Abaaoud and Salah Abdeslam were in prison together in Belgium. Abaaoud was apparently connected to Sharia4Belgium. Abaaoud was thought by counter-terrorism officials to have been close to Abu Bakr al- Bagdadi, and the link between ISIL leadership in Syria and terror cells operating in Europe. He was also connected to Charaffe al Mouadan, who was based in Syria and a participating member of ISIS prior to his death on 24 December. On 5 December, officials confirmed Abaaoud had two connections living in the Bordesley Green and Alum Rock areas of Birmingham, England. See alsoReferencesBibliography *E.

At the close of 2014 KCCU had CN$140 million in assets and approximately 13,000 members. It has 4 branches in Kingston. Kingston Civic Employees Credit Union The Kingston Civic Employees Credit Union was founded by members of the City of Kingston police, fire and municipal services departments and launched October 28, 1957. Alphonse Desjardins assisted CS Coop, the first credit union in Canada outside Quebec. Federal civil servants were prompted by an article in their magazine The Civilian, when it reported on loan sharks charging civil servants up to 200% for payday loans. After the Government of Ontario passed a credit union law in 1928, many credit unions like the Kingston-based institution were formed to ensure access to fair and equitable financial treatment for their members. Kingston Community Credit Union In 1974, Kingston Community Credit Union Limited applied to become an open-bond community Credit Union having merged with Northern Electric employees Credit Union and having amalgamated with the Teamsters Credit Union and Kingston General Hospital Employees Credit Union (by 1978). Starting from the basement of City Hall with 30 members each putting in 50 cents each, KCCU eventually moved to a location in downtown Kingston on Queen Street and eventually bought the 18 Market Street location across from City Hall. Since that time, KCCU has been a community bond credit union, open to all residents of Kingston and the greater area.

History = Early years and Cake  In The Whale began as a solo project for vocalist Nathaniel Valdez while obtaining his Masters in Educational Psychology at the University of Northern Colorado. With the addition of drummer Eric Riley, the duo relocated to Denver, CO. Both Valdez and Riley were raised in conservative and religious households. However, most of the content of their songs displays rebellious attitude against the views they were taught as youths. Valdez also cites his experience as an undertaker as a catalyst for the morbid nature of the band‚Äôs lyrical content of its newer material.  First release  Cake was their first commercial release in 2012, produced by Tickle Me Pink guitarist Joey Barba. The album is generally well-favoured, receiving positive reviews on iTunes. This gave scope for the band‚Äôs growth across the state of Colorado which eventually landed them an opportunity for a supporting slot on The Photo Atlas' Spring 2012 tour of the Midwest and inclusion in KTCL's annual Hometown for the Holidays contest. Two tracks from Cake were licensed to TV and films: ‚ÄúWoman,‚Äù in a Victory Motorcycles national TV commercial, and \\"Heels,\\" in the award-winning documentary Why We Ride. A live version of ‚ÄúHeels‚Äù has a record for the opening track on Colorado Public Radio's OpenAir 2015 Record Store Day release.  Nate & Eric  In the Whale‚Äôs subsequent release, Nate & Eric, gained press and radio play beyond their home state. The seven-track EP rated as high as #38 on the combined charts reported from various college and community radio stations. Nate & Eric reached #119 on the CMJ Top 200 and was one of the 20 Most Added Records, during the week of its debut. Nate was featured in a story published by Denver's Westword that detailed his day job - when he's not playing music. The band earned the opportunity to open the Denver installment of 2014‚Äôs Riot Fest and got to play at noted Regional Music Festivals like Treefort Music Festival and The UMS. In the Whale spent the summer and fall of 2014 touring alongside Guttermouth, Jane's Addiction and The Presidents of the United States of America.  Full Nelson, Lollapalooza, Austin City Limits  The release of 2015‚Äôs Full Nelson EP got them to #92 on the combined college radio charts. The band continued to receive favourable reviews not just for this release, but also for their live shows. Reviewer Brian Johnson calls the band \\"consistently enthralling;\\" reviewer Jed Murphy stated his only complaint about the album is \\"how short it is.\\" In 2015, the duo played at major music festivals such as Lollapalooza, Austin City Limits, Canadian Music Week and South by Southwest, which received reviews from the likes of the Chicago Tribune and others. The band's inclusion in the Lollapalooza line-up was a major distinction as they are among the five Colorado artists to play the event in the last decade. In the Whale served as the Official Correspondent for Denver's Westword newspaper during 2015's SXSW Music Festival in Austin, TX. The band was also selected for Taco Bell's 'Feed the Beat' and Quiznos 'Toasty on Tour' artist programs and included on New Music Seminar's Artists on the Verge list for 2015.  Neighbor  In the Whale entered a working relationship with Red Bull GmbH‚Äôs music incubator, Red Bull Sound Select, recording a two-song release with production by No Age (Sub Pop records), in September 2015. The title track ‚ÄúNeighbor‚Äù premiered October 14, 2015 via Substream Magazine, with the B-side track, \\"Pray for the Prey,\\" following on October 22, 2015 via CMJ.

It is a Grade II* listed building. Montacute has had religious significance since the discover of a stone crucifix in 1035. St Catherine's was built in association with the Cluniac Montacute Priory becoming the parish church after the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Much of the fabric of the current church is from its extension in the 13th century and the tower is from the 15th. It was restored in the Victorian period. The church has tombs and memorials to the Phelips family, of Montacute House. History It is not known when the first church was built on the site, however it was before 1035 when a black crucifix or Holy Rood was discovered within the grounds of the manor owned by Tofig. He loaded the life-sized cross onto a cart, and he then named a series of possible destinations owned by him. The oxen pulling the wagon (six red and six white in one version of the tale) refused to move until he said Waltham in Essex, where Tofig already had a hunting lodge. They then started, and continued non-stop until they reached Waltham, and where they stopped Tofig decided to build an abbey at the site ‚Äì this became Waltham Abbey. In the meantime, Tofig rebuilt the church at Waltham to house the cross, on which he bestowed his own sword, and his second wife Gytha (or Glitha), the daughter of Osgod Clapa, adorned the figure with a crown, bands of gold and precious stones. The cross became the object of pilgrimage, notably by Harold Godwinson. It was at Tofig's wedding at Lambeth on 8 June 1042 that King Harthacnut suddenly died of a convulsion \\"while standing at his drink\\". \\"Holy Cross\\" became the battle-cry of Harold's armies at the battles of Stamford Bridge and Hastings. The Holy Rood is said to have foretold Harold's defeat at Hastings: on the way there from the Battle of Stamford Bridge he stopped off at Waltham Abbey to pray, and the legend is that the cross \\"bowed down\\" off the wall as he did so, taken as a portent of doom. Around 1100 a church dedicated to St Peter had been built in association with Montacute Priory, by 1200 a chapel dedicated to St Catherine had been added next to the monks burial ground. Montacute Priory was a Cluniac priory of the Benedictine order. It was founded between 1078 and 1102 by William, Count of Mortain, in face of a threat that if he did not do so, the King would take the land from him. It was the only Somerset dependency of Cluny Abbey until 1407, when it gained independence from France. It was dissolved in 1539, though there was a short restoration under the Catholic Queen Mary. At its height in 1262 there were 25 monks. In 1539 there were a Prior and 16 monks. There are extensive earthworks to the south of St Catherine's Church which may be the claustral range, and a fishpond. Village oral tradition has it that an earlier church, presumably St Peter's, was destroyed in a fire. There is little evidence of this, though fire-reddened carved stonework, said to be from this church was reused in the lower courses of the rear of the village school kitchen. (This is in private hands and not visible to the public). A few other pieces of burnt stone are in other village buildings, though none carved. In the 1830s conflict between the vicar, Reverend Albion Cox, and the church bell ringers about the ringing of the bells for a local secular feast day lead to rioting and arrests. The vicar of Montacute between 1885 and 1918 was the Reverend Charles Francis Powys (1843‚Äì1923), father of the writers John Cowper Powys, Llewelyn Powys and Theodore Francis Powys. Philippa Powys, their sister, and another author, was born in Montacute. Architecture Edward Phelips The only fabric surviving from the church of 1170 is the Norman chancel arch. The rest of the church was altered in the 13th with the construction of the present chancel, transepts and north porch. The four bay nave was built in the 15th century and includes Perpendicular traceried windows. The three stage square tower, which is supported by corner buttresses is from the 15th century. The peal of six bells in the tower range in age from the early 17th to 20th century. They were rehung in 1948. The clock face was added in 1815. Extensive Victorian restoration was undertaken in 1870 by Henry Hall. This included the addition of a vestry onto the south side of the chancel. The organ was moved to its current position over the porch from the base of the tower. The churchyard, which now extends into the area once part of the priory, contains the remains of a 15th-century cross, and multiple monuments. Interior Monument to Bridget Phelips The north transept of the church contains monuments to the Phelips family, of Montacute House, including David and Ann, who died in 1484, and Bridget, who died 1508. There are canopied effigies of Thomas, died 1588, and Elizabeth, died 1598. On the west wall is a marble monument to Edward, who died in 1680. An Anglo-Saxon Hamstone font lay unidentified in the churchyard for many years, but has now been reinstated replacing its Tudor successor. The majority of the interior decoration is from the Victorian restoration. Parish The parish is part of the benefice of Odcombe, Brympton, Lufton and Montacute within the Diocese of Bath and Wells.

He served the Mughal emperor, Muhammad Shah, until his death at the Battle of Karnal. During Nader Shah's invasion of the Mughal Empire, Muhammad Shah sent out a request for troops throughout his lands and gathered a large force to face the invaders. One of the Mughal nobles who answered the call of the Emperor was Khan Dowran, being appointed de facto commander in chief of the Mughal army upon Muhammad Shah's request. After the arrival of a contingent of Mughal forces under the command of Sa'adat Khan, the rearguard of this reinforcing column came under attack from Persian skirmishes who looted the baggage. Sa'adat Khan set out in pursuit and was lured into battle. After reports came into the Mughal camp, Muhammad Shah strongly favoured aiding Sa'adat Khan's troops but Khan Dowran advised caution, stating any aid given to Sa'adat khan would only involve a greater number of Mughal troops in Sa'adat Khan's defeat. After Muhammad Shah questioned his courage, Khan Dowran donned his armour and set out to link up with Sa'adat Khan. However, Nader Shah sent out a number of troops to feign retreat and managed to separate Khan Dowran and Sa'adat Khan and defeat each in detail. Khan Dowran's soldiers were decimated and he himself was badly injured and died later that evening after being carried back to the Mughal camp by his retainers.

The by- election was caused by the death of incumbent MP Charles Kettle on 5 June, and was won by Edward Cargill. Background The Bruce electorate was formed in the 1860 electoral redistribution. It covered the rural area surrounding Dunedin that had previously been part of the Dunedin Country electorate. The Bruce electorate was a two-member constituency. Charles Kettle and Thomas Gillies were the initial representatives. Kettle died on 5 June 1862, and this caused the by-election. The Otago Gold Rush had started in May 1861 and the wider area experienced a significant increase in population, including the Bruce electorate. The lists of registered electors in several electorate, including Bruce, were revised during July 1862. The Miners' Representation Act, 1860 allowed miners to also vote under certain conditions, and they were not registered in lists; there were approximate 3,000 of them eligible in the Bruce electorate. It is thus not possible to say how many electors were qualified to vote in the by-election. Towards the end of June, it became known that William Baldwin, the gold fields commissioner at Waitahuna, would be a candidate in the by-election. John Gillies, the father of Thomas Gillies, acted as the returning officer for the by-election, and he set the nomination meeting for Monday, 28 July at 12 noon. At that meeting, F. C. Fulton (a brother of James Fulton) proposed and Otago Provincial Councillor Andrew Todd seconded Baldwin. The second candidate, Edward Cargill, was proposed by William Hunter Reynolds and seconded by Johnny Jones, a former business partner of Cargill. The third person to be proposed was John Cargill, the brother of Edward Cargill, but this came as a surprise to the former who stated that he was not available for election. The two candidates then addressed the electors, and the obvious policy difference between them was that Baldwin was a proponent of separation of the South Island from the North Island, whilst Cargill supported one New Zealand. Julius Vogel, himself a strong proponent of the separation question, then put some hard questions to Cargill. The meeting finished with a show of hands in favour of Cargill (42 to 8 hands), and Baldwin demanded a poll. Results Polling booths were in Dunedin at the court house, and at the school houses in East Taieri and Tokomairiro (since renamed to Milton), and Warepa (a locality near Balclutha). The election was held on Thursday, 31 July, between 9am and 4 pm. By Saturday, 2 August, the Dunedin newspapers had not received the results from the Warepa booth, but Cargill was leading by 20 votes. The Warepa results were received later that morning, and the returning officer declared the official results that day. There were just two votes at Warepa, with one for each candidate, hence the majority did not change and Cargill was declared elected. Cargill represented the Bruce electorate until 1865, when he resigned. He was succeeded by James Macandrew in the July 1865 by-election. Baldwin was elected in the 1863 supplementary election in the electorate.

Early life Bhatti was born and raised in Oslo to parents of Pakistani origin. He spent several years in Pakistan during his childhood in addition to attending school in Norway, but was eventually brought under the care of a child protection institution. He joined the criminal youth gang Young Guns when he was thirteen years old, and when he was fifteen years old he hit the owner of a local grocery store in the head with a glass bottle so that it shattered and then stabbed the victim in the abdomen numerous times, for which he received his first criminal conviction. In 1998 he was convicted for having shot a person as part of an extortion assignment. The court psychiatrist then concluded that Bhatti had \\"insufficiently developed mental capacities\\", and as part of later court proceedings in 2004 and in 2006 assessors concluded that he had dissocial personality disorder. Bhatti resided in Pakistan in the early 2000s, during which time he was described to have become more religious and more extreme. Oslo Synagogue attack Bhatti was in 2006 charged for shots fired against the Oslo Synagogue, and for planning to detonate bombs against the American and Israeli embassies in Oslo. Earlier the same year he had been stopped by police in Germany with pictures and notes concerning weaponry, which he claimed to be for self-defence during travels in the Middle East. He was convicted for co-conspiracy to the shots fired against the synagogue in 2008, but acquitted for terror plans against the American and Israeli embassies. He was held in custody for three years, from 2006 to 2009 in connection with the case. In 2006 he was charged but not convicted for shots fired against the home of journalist Nina Johnsrud of the newspaper Dagsavisen. Profetens Ummah Bhatti first appeared publicly as an Islamist in January 2012 as the leader of a group of protesters outside the Storting, the Norwegian parliament building, from the Islamist group Profetens Ummah. He has been described as a key and leading figure in Profetens Ummah. In August 2012 he was dismissed from attending a court proceeding against Mullah Krekar. In May 2015, Bastian Vasquez, a Profetens Ummah member, was executed by fellow ISIL members, after he had killed the two-year-old stepson of Bhatti. Arrest in Pakistan In 2012 it was initially reported by some news outlets that Bhatti had travelled to fight in Syria along with other Norwegian jihadists, but it was soon reported by other sources that he probably was in Pakistan instead. Bhatti was later found to have been imprisoned in northern Pakistan from January 2013 to August 2014, although he according to his lawyer was eventually acquitted from his charges of having had contacts with the Taliban. He appeared in Norway again in January 2015 after a flight ban against him had been lifted. After his return he was detained by the police and charged with two domestic violence cases. In March he reportedly met and brought personal belongings to fellow member of Profetens Ummah Omar Cheblal in Greece, who had been expelled from Norway. Bhatti was at the same time sentenced to ten months in prison for domestic violence against his children, but appealed the verdict. In April he went on a pilgrimage to Mecca. In June he was stopped on the Turkish border and denied entry into the country by Turkish authorities deeming him a \\"danger to national security\\". Bhatti claimed that he had only planned a vacation at a hotel in the country. In late July Bhatti was arrested with new violence charges. He began serving his ten-month domestic violence sentence in August after the verdict was upheld in courts of appeal. In January 2016 he was sentenced to fourteen days in prison for violence against his wife. Personal life Bhatti has been married three times, he first married a Pakistani woman in 2003 whom he had been engaged to since 1995. They had three children together. They were later divorced, and Bhatti was in 2012 charged for domestic violence against his ex-wife and children, and at the same time lost custody for his children. He subsequently had Muslim marriages with two other women, first with Norwegian-Algeri flight stewardess Maryam Salvesen in 2010 and later with Norwegian-Pakistani Aisha Shezadi from 2012. The latter, a known Islamist activist, ended in divorce later the same year, when he divorced her via SMS while he was away in Pakistan. The couple had one son together, who died shortly after Shezadi took him to Syria with her in late 2014. According to court documents he has at least one other child. Bhatti had a romantic relationship with a journalist for the television station TV 2 in 2006, in the period before the attack against the Oslo Synagogue.

He remained in Warsaw until 1809, when he moved to Dresden, where he studied with the Austrian painter, Josef Grassi.Brief biography @ Encyklopedia Warmii i Mazur. Upon returning to Warsaw in 1815, he became curator of the plaster casts and drawing teacher of the Faculty of Fine Arts at the University of Warsaw. In 1819, he was appointed a Professor. After the University was closed in 1831, he gave private lessons and did restorative work. In addition to his portraits, he created works on religious and mythological subjects and did ceiling frescoes. Together with his students, he painted decorations at churches throughout Warmia; including Reszel, where he did an altar painting of Saint Catherine, and Saint James Cathedral in Olsztyn, where he painted \\"Our Lady of Sorrows\\". He also organized exhibitions in the Palaces of Niebor√≥w and Kr√≥likarnia.Biographical notes @ Onet (Portal Wiedzy).

M. leptogenoides is the only species assigned to the genus, which is one of several Lutetian Ponerinae genera.  History and classification  When described, Messelepone was known from two fossil insects which are compression-impression fossils preserved in layers of soft sedimentary rock. Along with other well preserved insect fossils, the Messelepone specimens were collected from layers of the Lutetian Messel pit World Heritage Site. The formation is composed of brown coals, oil shales, and bituminous shale, which preserved numerous insects, fish, birds, reptiles, and terrestrial mammals as a notable lagerst√§tten. The area is a preserved maar lake which initially formed approximately 47 million years ago as the result of volcanic explosions. At the time of description, the holotype queen and paratype male specimens were preserved in the Senckenberg Research Station Messel fossil collections. The fossils were described by Gennady Dlussky and Sonja Wedmann in a 2012 paper on the poneromorph ants of Messel, with both the genus and species named in it. The genus name is a combination of the ant genus Ponera and Messel after the type locality. The specific epithet was derived from the modern ant genus name Leptogenys, which M. leptogenoides has similarities to. Messelepone is one of five extinct genera from three subfamilies which have species described from Messel Formation fossils by Dlussky and Wedmann in 2012. Three of the other genera Cephalopone, Cyrtopone, and Protopone are also placed in Ponerinae. The genus Casaleia is placed in Amblyoponinae, while the last genus Pseudectatomma is in Ectatomminae. Description M. leptogenoides male The Messelepone queen was described as having an approximate body length of with a head that is distinctly small, the mesosoma being almost two times greater in length. The subtriangular mandibles are up to one half the head length and have toothed chewing faces. Like Protopone species, the antennae sockets are widely placed on the head, in contrast to those seen in Pachycondyla which are close together. The node- shaped petiole is shorter than the height, with a helcium that projects of the front face of the gasteral segment. Both the queen and male have a distinct petiole, rectangular in side view, similar to some species of Leptogenys. Both genders also have a gaster with the first segment shorter than the second segment. The queen has eyes that are oval in shape and placed slightly forward from the heads midpoint. The gena below the eyes are a little shorter than the eyes are wide. The rectangular petiole lacks a peduncle between it and the mesosoma. The male is smaller than the gyne, with an estimated body length of . The eyes are round and the gena only half as long as the eyes are wide. The thirteen segmented antennae have a filifrom morphology and the scape is short. The second antenna segment is nearly the same length as wide, contrasting the next segment which is 3.5 times longer than wide. The mandibles are well developed and opposable, a feature that separates M. leptogenoides males from those of Pachycondyla species.

It comprises 215 stories arranged into eight chapters: the first six chapters contain accounts of Yan Ying's remonstrations with the rulers he served, while the seventh chapter contains variants on stories from the first six chapters, and the eighth chapter has anti-Confucian episodes that the Han dynasty imperial librarian Liu Xiangwho compiled the received version of the Yanzi chunqiu in the late 1st centuryconsidered to be inconsistent with the Chinese Classics. The Yanzi chunqiu incorporates themes from both Confucianism and Mohism, and does not fit easily into any single philosophical tradition. History The first mention of the Yanzi chunqiu in a received work appears in the 62nd chapter of the ancient historian Sima Qian's late 2nd century work Records of the Grand Historian (Shiji Âè≤Ë®ò), the first of China's 24 dynastic histories. Sima states that many scholars of his generation had copies of the text, but does not mention any author for it. Contemporary sources indicate that, like many Chinese texts, the Yanzi chunqiu anciently circulated in a variety of different versions and collections. In the late 1st century, the Han dynasty imperial librarian Liu Xiang edited thirty total Yanzi chunqiu chapters down to the eight chapters that compose the modern received text. In 1972, a large cache of bamboo slip writings known as the Yinqueshan Han slips were discovered in a Han dynasty tomb near Linyi, Shandong Province. Among the slips, which date to the early 2nd century, were 18 stories from the Yanzi chunqiu, thus confirming historical accounts of the Yanzi chunqiu's early existence. Content The Yanzi chunqiu comprises 215 stories arranged into eight chapters. The first six \\"inner\\" chapters contain accounts of Yan Ying's remonstrations with the rulers he served, and the seventh chapter contains variants on stories from the first six chapters, while the eighth chapter has anti-Confucian episodes that Liu Xiang considered to be inconsistent with the Chinese Classics. Themes The Yanzi chunqiu has proven difficult to classify into one single philosophical tradition, and much of the traditional Chinese scholarship on it has focused on its classification. The bibliographical catalogs of the early dynastic histories list it as a Confucian (\\"Ruist\\") work, but in the early 8th century the poet and scholar Liu Zongyuan strongly argued that the Yanzi was actually a Mohist work, given its numerous references to such hallmark Mohist terms as \\"universal/impartial caring\\" (jiƒÅn'√†i ), \\"opposition to music\\" (fƒìi yu√® ), and \\"frugality\\" (ji√© y√≤ng ). Liu recognized that Yan Ying could not have been a follower of Mozi, which would be anachronistic, but believed that the Yanzi was written later by one of Mozi's followers who was familiar with the traditions of the State of Qi. Liu's view that the Yanzi was a Mohist work was echoed by many subsequent Chinese scholars.

He was expelled from the Communist Party of Vietnam due to his opposing and critical opinions of the party and the state of Vietnam, particularly during post-Vietnam War.  Biography  His real name was T·∫° Ng·ªçc Ph√°ch. He grew up in Th√°i B√¨nh Province. His father worked for bureau of interpretation in Hanoi, a quite high social status. In 1939, he became a journalist in Hanoi. He was captured by the French that year but then released due to lack of evidence. He joined the Communist Party of Vietnam in 1940. At the end of 1941, he was captured again. This time, he was sentenced to 15 years imprison. Late 1941, from Hoa Lo (Hanoi), he was exiled to S∆°n La.

Reform view  As a leader of national culture (after the war, he worked in the culture section), he wanted to give it more freedom. He is aware that culture without freedom is dead and culture with only propaganda is also dead. The more control, the more deadly culture is and the rarer valuable masterpiece. In terms of Communist Party leadership, he said:\\" I advocate the leadership role of the Party. However, leadership does not mean dictatorship. History shows that every dictatorship will eventually end up in corruption, rotten society and Party itself.\\" In his opinion, the underlying cause of negative phenomenon in the Party and the society is partly due to the absolute rule of Communist Party. He insisted that: Communist Party must give up dictator regime, give power to the national assembly, government. There must be laws allowing freedom for a new party, freedom of speech, journalism laws, publishing. Election laws, forgo the decision jusridiction of the Party. It is this opinion that resulted in his expulsion from the party.

It was designed by Arthur Robson and built in 1927 by P Mellefont, Jnr. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 28 April 2000.  History  The Paragon Theatre in Childers was constructed in 1927 for local film exhibitors Gee, Philpott and Gee. It was designed by Brisbane architect Arthur Robson and replaced a smaller refreshment rooms and entertainment hall/picture show on the site. Childers in 1927 was a prosperous sugar town established in the late 1880s at the head of the Isis railway line from Isis Junction into the surrounding scrub. The line, which opened on 31 October 1887, was intended to facilitate the transport of timber from the Isis Scrub, but also proved to be the catalyst for the establishment of a sugar industry in the district. By 1895, Childers had emerged as the flourishing centre of a substantial sugar- growing and sugar-milling district, and in the years between 1891 and 1900 the population grew from 91 to 4000. In 1903 the old Isis Divisional Board (1886) was abolished and Isis Shire proclaimed, with the new seat of municipal government moving from Howard to Childers. Mr William Gee, a confectioner from Bundaberg, moved to Childers with his wife Minette and their two children about 1906. The Gees bought a single-storeyed shop where the Paragon Theatre now stands, in the main street of Childers, and opened it as a refreshment rooms (fruit shop, tea rooms and catering business). By 1908 they had added a ballroom in the form of a second floor to the building, and this was used for various functions, including Friday and Saturday night dances before the floor was ruined by roller skating. In 1912, the Gees installed a lighting plant run by an oil fuelled engine, and Gee's Hall became the venue for the first silent movies screened in the district. The first film shown was The Iron Claw, starring Pearl White. The Gees also introduced a travelling picture show service to other towns in the Isis district, including Dallarnil and Booyal. By 1923 a second picture show, the Palace Theatre, had been opened in Childers. It was run by Harold Philpott in partnership with Mr A Archer, and was located in a hall behind the Palace Hotel in Churchill Street. Also by 1923, William Gee had disposed of his interest in Gee's Hall to his son Dudley and to Harold Philpott. He later retired with his wife and daughter to Sydney, where he died in 1926. By 1927, film-going had proved so popular that Philpott & Gee had determined to erect a modern, purpose-designed cinema in Childers. The scheme interested William Gee's daughter Margery, and a new firm, Gee, Philpott and Gee was established to facilitate the construction of the Paragon Theatre where Gee's Hall once stood. Some of the material from the original hall was used in the construction of the new theatre. Plans were prepared by architect Arthur Robson of Brisbane, who was reported in the local press of 1927 as having been responsible for the construction of over twenty cinemas in Queensland, including theatres at East Brisbane, Gladstone and Ayr. Robson designed the Paragon Theatre as a tropical theatre. This may refer to the use of timber lattice and fretwork throughout the interior, on the ceiling and the proscenium, concealing high level windows providing ventilation not used in standard cinema design. The tropical theatre style was popular for Queensland theatres of the 1920s and 1930s, including the Alhambra Theatre at Stones Corner and the Paddington Theatre on Given Terrace, Paddington, Brisbane. The writer of an article on the Paragon Theatre in the Bundaberg Times Isis District Souvenir of 1927, commented: > In all centres it has been recognised that the old style theatres are not > suitable, hence modern ideas have been brought to bear in the planning of > structures suitable for the climatic conditions, and a new type of theatre > evolved, one of which will rise on the site of the present Gee's Hall. (p19) The theatre was intended to accommodate 1200 people, in a hall measuring , but this may have been optimistic - the Film Weekly Directory of 1938-39 lists the Paragon Theatre at Childers with a seating capacity of 600. A large stage for both traditional drama and musical shows as well as the cinema screen, with adjoining dressing rooms, was provided, with an orchestra pit below the stage. The proscenium was decorated with timber fretwork incorporating transparent lining which concealed electric lighting. The ceiling and walls were lined with timber lattice. The theatre contained a dress circle and several private boxes with upholstered seating, and canvas seats and forms, or long benches, were provided in the stalls. The auditorium was constructed of timber with a galvanised iron roof, but the Mediterranean-styled decorative facade was of brick and stucco. The entrance was flagged by brick columns clad with glazed tiles and opened to a lobby wide by deep. The design also incorporated two small shops fronting the street, either side of the entrance, and employed the first cantilevered awning in the district. The contractor on the project was P Mellefont, junr. During construction, Gee, Philpott & Gee screened films at the Palace Theatre and at the Band Hall at Childers until a temporary screen could be erected in the semi-completed Paragon Theatre. Reputedly, when the new picture theatre formally opened in 1928, the first film screened was Warner Brothers' 1927 classic The Jazz Singer, which pioneered synchronised- sound film production. If this were so, then the Paragon opened as a \\"talkie\\" theatre. Soon after the opening of the new theatre Harold Philpott sold his share of the business to Dudley and Margery Gee, who exhibited under the name Paragon Pictures Company. The Paragon Theatre was now the only picture theatre in the Isis and regularly screened films and cartoons on Wednesday and Saturday nights, from 8 pm, for which seats could be reserved. The theatre was sold in 1949 to Peter and Mary Sourris of Gayndah, who changed the sound system, replaced the entrance gates with glass doors, closed one of the internal staircases to the dress circle, and replaced the forms with canvas seats. At this period the store run by Paul Cominos at the front of the theatre was closed. By 1960 the Sourris family had sold the theatre to Granville and Iris Knowles who constructed a ticket box and fitted a cinemascope screen, which closed the stage for concert use. The theatre was sold in 1962 to the Ricciardi family. The last film was shown in 1998. In 2007 Thomas Griffiths and Merissa Ricciardi (granddaughter of the 1962 owners) purchased the theatre and worked to repair and restore its failing elements with the aim of accommodating a range of community uses. The business name Paragon Theatre (1962) remained registered. In October 2011, Ms Ricciardi and new co-owner Nigel Craft were continuing the restoration of the building to reopen it to the public as an entertainment venue. Merissa Ricciardi and Nigel Craft were married in the theatre in December 2012. The theatre reopened in July 2014. In August 2015, the Crafts received a Queensland Heritage Award from the National Trust for their conservation of the theatre. Approximately 130 rural picture theatres/shows were listed in the Queensland Post Office Directory for 1930-31, and this list was not exhaustive. A recent survey of rural theatres conducted by Griffith University revealed that few 1920s cinemas were still operating in regional Queensland. Surviving theatres included the Majestic Theatre at Pomona (erected 1921 - seats 300); the Astor Theatre at Surat (1925 - seats 150); the Majestic Picture Theatre at Malanda (1926 -seats 300); the Radio at Barcaldine (1926 - seats 550) and the Airdome at Innisfail (1928 - seats 760).  Description  The Paragon Theatre is a large timber building with a masonry facade prominently located on Churchill Street in Childers. The rear section of the building is a large shed-like form clad in unpainted timber weatherboards with a pitched, galvanised iron roof. The side walls have high level louvred openings under the eaves and timber framed windows in the lower section of the wall. The parapeted facade is composed of face brick pilasters which divide the surface into three bays rendered with roughcast stucco. The parapet edge features a rectangular signage block flanked by a masonry balustrade. Three sets of timber casement windows are located in the upper sections of each of the bays. The glass of the windows has been painted and each set of windows is surmounted by horizontal awnings with small hipped roofs and supported by timber brackets. The upper section of the facade is painted in a dark chocolate brown. A large awning projects from the surface of the facade, supported by iron tie-backs. The horizontal awning features a centrally located shallow arch which defines the entrance. Raised lettering on the front of the awning spelling \\"PARAGON\\" is located on the arch. The entrance is via concrete steps to four pairs of folding glass and timber doors. Tapered pylons abutting the wall surface flank the entrance doors and support another arch over the doorway. The pylons, archway and trim on the awning are all painted in bright red with the remainder of the lower facade painted in dark green. Two shop fronts are situated at the corners of the front facade. The entry area has also been sub- divided with a lightweight partition in order to create a sub-tenancy. These three shopfront areas are currently unoccupied. The original ticket office and small foyer area are located to the eastern side of the entry. Internally the theatre retains many of its early features, including seating, timber fretwork and lattice, light fittings and some balustrading. The ceiling and most of the side walls are covered with timber lattice mounted on timber posts, that stops just above the level of the exit doors in the side walls. The bottom edge of the lattice is finished with shallow arches trimmed with a double stripe painted in black. At the top of the side walls is a broad band of decoration achieved by picking out a pattern within the lattice with black paint. The screen is covered with long curtains and is surrounded with fibro- cement panelling that frames the screen, now covering the proscenium. The orchestra pit has also been boarded over. Most of the ground floor seating consists of canvas, deckchair-type seating with one row of tip-up seating located against the back wall. The balcony upstairs has a raked, stepped timber floor, with each row of seats occupying a different level. The seating in the front three rows is timber and upholstered fixed seating, there are then two rows of canvas seats and a final row of \\"dress circle\\" seating at the back. The projection box if located at the rear of the balcony in a space enclosed with fibro- cement panelling. A small timber residence is connected to the rear of the building and appears to be unoccupied. There is also a galvanised iron shed and timber tankstand and tank adjacent to this small house.  Heritage listing  Paragon Theatre was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 28 April 2000 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Paragon Theatre, constructed in 1927, is one of the oldest picture theatres still operating in Queensland and is important an illustrating a significant aspect of the pattern of this state's history, namely, the expansion of popular entertainment in Queensland in the interwar period. In particular, the construction and continued operation of the Paragon Theatre illustrates the vital and substantive role of independent film exhibition in rural Queensland. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The Paragon Theatre is a rare surviving 1920s Queensland regional theatre which still functions as a cinema, and is important in demonstrating an aspect of Queensland's cultural heritage which is no longer common. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The building is a good example of 1920s regional picture theatre architecture adapted to the Queensland climate, and is important in illustrating its type. It is a highly intact 1920s cinema which reveals important information about picture theatre design in Queensland during a formative period. The intactness of the interior in particular offers present and future generations an understanding of the experience of cinema viewing in a rural Queensland picture theatre of the interwar era. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The Paragon Theatre, located prominently fronting the main street of Childers, has a distinctive facade which makes a major contribution to an exceptional streetscape of buildings in Churchill Street (Bruce Highway), Childers. In this it has aesthetic significance. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The theatre was a focal point of social life in the Childers/Isis district from the late 1920s until well into the 1969s, and has a strong association for the local community with popular entertainment and movie-going in the period before the ready availability of television and videotape players.

Career and life William inherited the manor of Harringworth including a park and wood upon the death of his mother Millicent de Cantilupe in 1299. William was summoned to Parliament by writ as Baron Zouche of Harringworth from 1308 to 1325 and to serve against the Scottish from 1314 (after the disastrous Battle of Bannockburn) to 1317. William was pardoned for his role in the death of Piers Gaveston in October 1313 but made a Conservator of the Peace in Northamptonshire from 1317 to 1321 and ordered to suppress illegal meetings. In February 1322 William was ordered to muster as many men-at-arms and foot soldiers as he could and to march to the King to aid in the suppression of the rebels of Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster. William declined and sent two men-at- arms in June, claiming ill health as his excuse. Later in 1322 William was summoned to serve against the Scots and against Lancaster's rebels. He was summoned to defend Aquitaine in 1324, which was lost under the poor leadership of Hugh le Despenser, 1st Earl of Winchester, and to go to Gascony in 1325. After Queen Isabella and Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March's successful overthrow of her husband, Edward II, William was summoned to the Parliament held in January 1327 which decided it had lost confidence in the rule of Edward and forced his abdication.

Biography Born in 1914 in Palermo, he was fascinated by the ancient Egypt since childhood, with a particular interest on the Greco-Roman period. In 1931 he enrolled the Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa and later he moved to France and studied under Gustave Lefebvre, Alexandre Moret and √âtienne Drioton. Donadoni then moved to Egypt, and since 1935 he participated to an excavation campaign at Antinoopolis led by his teacher, the archaeologist Evaristo Breccia. In 1938 he was a student of Hermann Junker at Cairo. During the war, from 1938 to 1940, he joined the excavation of the Middle Kingdom temple of Medinet Madi led by Achille Vogliano. At the end of the 1940s he returned to Italy and started teaching at the University of Pisa, and later at the Sapienza University of Rome. In the late 1950s Donadoni was invited to join the team of archaeologists that operated the relocation of the Abu Simbel temples in Nubia due to the construction of the Aswan High Dam and the subsequent formation of Lake Nasser. Among his students at this time, notable were Edda Bresciani, and Anna Maria Roveri who later became his wife. His later, several excavations and studies are mostly concentrated in Nubia; among the others, since 1973 he excavated at Jebel Barkal. He also excavated the 26th Dynasty tomb TT27 at Thebes which belonged to Shoshenq, chief steward of the Divine Adoratrice Ankhnesneferibre.

There are additional variants of this Trojan that target other Unix and Unix-like systems. Discovered on November 5, 2015, by Dr. Web, this malware affected at least tens of Linux users. Linux.Encoder.1 is remotely executed on the victim's computer by using a flaw in Magento, a popular Content management system app. When activated, the malware encrypts certain types of files stored on mounted local and network drives using AES and RSA Public-key cryptography, with the private key stored only on the malware's control servers. The malware then store a file called \\"readme_to_decrypt.txt\\" in every directory, containing a message, which offers to decrypt the data if a payment (through Bitcoin) is made. Compared to other ransomware such as CryptoLocker, the malware does not state a deadline to pay and the ransom does not increase over time.  Discovery  On November 5, 2015, Dr. Web, a Russian anti-malware company added to its virus database Linux.Encoder.1. The company then published the malware description the day after. This ransomware is written in C using the PolarSSL library.  Operation = Propagation  According to Bitdefender Labs, the most common infection vector is through a flaw in Magento, a shopping cart software. CheckPoint, reported this vulnerability in April 2015. After this report, Magento issued a fix. However, a lot of small e-commerce sites did not apply this critical update. Linux host might also be attacked using other exploits.  File encryption  Encrypted files = When launched with administrator privileges, the program load in memory two files containing the attackers' demands : * ./readme.crypto * ./index.crypto After this the ransomware receives the public RSA key. The malware will then start as a daemon and delete all its original files. The trojan will encrypt files with the extensions : \\".php\\", \\".html\\", \\".tar\\", \\".gz\\", \\".sql\\", \\".js\\", \\".css\\", \\".txt\\" \\".pdf\\", \\".tgz\\", \\".war\\", \\".jar\\", \\".java\\", \\".class\\", \\".ruby\\", \\".rar\\" \\".zip\\", \\".db\\", \\".7z\\", \\".doc\\", \\".pdf\\", \\".xls\\", \\".properties\\", \\".xml\\" \\".jpg\\", \\".jpeg\\", \\".png\\", \\".gif\\", \\".mov\\", \\".avi\\", \\".wmv\\", \\".mp3\\" \\".mp4\\", \\".wma\\", \\".aac\\", \\".wav\\", \\".pem\\", \\".pub\\", \\".docx\\", \\".apk\\" \\".exe\\", \\".dll\\", \\".tpl\\", \\".psd\\", \\".asp\\", \\".phtml\\", \\".aspx\\", \\".csv\\". The malicious program encrypts files with the aforementioned extensions in the following directories : * /home * /root * /var/lib/mysql * /var/www * /etc/nginx * /etc/apache2 * /var/log After this, the malware will encrypt all the files from directories with a name starting by : * public_html * www * webapp * backup * .git * .svn The program will not encrypt files in the following directories : * / * /root/ * .ssh * /usr/bin * /bin * /etc/ssh Content of the \\"readme_for_decrypt.txt\\" on a Linux server. The program will then generate a file \\"readme_for_decryption.txt\\" in every folder. This file contains the bitcoin address generated specifically for the ransom and the website to download the decrypting tool hosted on a .onion website. = Encryption method = Like other ransomware, Linux.Encoder.1 use mixed-encryption algorithms to encrypt data. It starts by generating an AES key on the victim's and encrypts all of the previous files using AES-CBC-128. Then the RSA- encrypted AES key is prepended to the beginning of every encrypted file, with the original file permissions and the IV used by the AES algorithm. All the encrypted files have \\".encrypted\\" added at the end of their file name. The program use the libc rand() function with the timestamp at the moment of encryption as seed to generate the IV and the keys.  Decryption  When the payment to the cybercriminal is made, the victim can download a PHP script to their computer. This script will use the RSA private key to recover the symmetric AES key and decrypt all the files with the \\".encrypted\\" extension. Along with the file decryption, the decryption tool will also delete every \\"readme_for_decryption.txt\\" file on the hard drive.  Recovering files  Because of the use of the timestamp as a seed for creating the keys and the IV for encryption, decryption of files encrypted by the ransomware is trivial given that the original timestamp information is kept intact. Researchers at Bitdefender Labs have found and exploited this weakness to recover the files without having to pay the criminals.  On other Unix systems  * Linux.Encoder.1 has been recompiled on Mac, called KeRanger. * There is a version that infects FreeBSD.

Her hagiography, The Life-Struggles of Walatta Petros (G√§dl√§ W√§l√§tt√§ PÃ£e·π≠ros) was written in 1672. She is known for resisting conversion to Roman Catholicism, forming many religious communities, and performing miracles for those seeking asylum from kings.  Names  Walatta Petros's name in the Ge'ez script is written as ·ãà·àà·â∞ ·å¥·å•·àÆ·àµ. It is transliterated into the Latin alphabet in many ways online and scholarship, including the Library of Congress spelling Walata P√©·π≠ros and Walatta Pƒì·π≠ros. Her name is a compound name, meaning \\"Daughter of [St] Peter,\\" and cannot ever be shortened from \\"Walatta Petros\\" to \\"Petros.\\" Other spellings are Walata Petros, Wallatta Petros, Wallata Petros, Waleta Petros, Waletta Petros, Walete Petros, Walleta Petros, Welete Petros, Wolata Petros plus Walatta P√©tros, Walatta Pietros, Walatta Petrus, and W√§l√§t√§ P'√©t'ros.  Life =Early life Walatta Petros was born in 1592 into a noble family with hereditary rights to lands in southern Abyssinia. Her father and brothers were officials at court. Walatta Petros was married at a young age to a man named M√§lk…ô‚Äô√§ Kr…ôstos, one of King Susenyos's counselors. She gave birth to three children who all died in infancy and she decided to become a nun. Becoming a nun After Jesuit missionaries privately converted King Sus…ônyos from Ethiopian orthodoxy to Roman Catholicism in 1612, he called on Walatta Petros's husband to repress the anti-Catholic rebellion started in 1617. When M√§lk…ô‚Äô√§ Kr…ôstos left to fight the rebellion, leading bishops in the Ethiopian monasteries on Lake ·π¨ana assisted Walatta Petros in leaving her husband and joining them. After arriving at a monastery on Lake ·π¨ana, she took a vow of celibacy and shaved her head to become a nun in the Ethiopian Orthodox T√§wa·∏•…ôdo Church, refusing to convert to Roman Catholicism. However, church and court officials urged her to return to her husband, because he was destroying the town where she was hiding. She returned home, but when she found out that her husband had supported the killing the patriarch of the Ethiopian Orthodox T√§wa·∏•…ôdo Church, she left him for the final time, becoming a nun at the age of 25 in 1617. Resisting Roman Catholicism and the King In 1621, King Sus…ônyos forbade the teaching of Ethiopian orthodoxy and Walatta Petros began to protest the king's abandonment of Ethiopia's faith to embrace foreign beliefs and rituals. She was called before the court in 1622 for these protests, and the king wanted to kill her, but her family was able to dissuade him. She then moved to the northern regions of Wald…ôbba and ·π¢√§ll√§mt and began preaching that people should reject the faith of the foreigners and never mention the name of the king during the liturgy. She was again called before the court in 1625 for this treason, and this time her husband dissuaded the king from killing her, urging him to send the leader of the Jesuit priests, Afonso Mendes, to try to convert her. When Mendes was unsuccessful, the king sent her into exile in Sudan for three years. This was the beginning of her leadership of the religious communities that formed around her of those seeking to escape Roman Catholicism. Over her lifetime, she set up seven religious communities‚Äîthe first in Sudan, called ≈Ω√§b√§y (ca. 1627), and six around Lake ·π¨ana: ƒåÃ£anq ∑a (ca. 1630), M«ù·π£elle (ca. 1630), Z√§ge (ca. 1632), D√§mboza (ca. 1637), Af√§r F√§r√§s (ca. 1638), and Z√§bol/Z√§mbol (ca. 1641). Meanwhile, in 1632, King Sus…ônyos gave up trying convert the country to Roman Catholicism. His son Fasil√§d√§s became king, and Fasil√§d√§s worked to eradicate Roman Catholicism from the country. In 1650, Fasil√§d√§s gave land for a monastery on Lake ·π¨ana, Q ∑√§ra·π≠a, to be devoted to Walatta Petros. Since the seventeenth century, it has served as a place of asylum for those seeking to escape punishment by the king. Later life Walatta Petros continued as the abbess of her mobile religious community, leading it with her woman friend ∆é·∏´…ôt√§ Kr…ôstos and without male leadership. After a three-month illness, Walatta Petros died on November 23, 1642 CE (·∏™…ôdar 17), at the age of 50, twenty-six years after becoming a nun. Her friend ∆é·∏´…ôt√§ Kr…ôstos succeeded her as abbess of her religious community, until her death in 1649.  Hagiography  Walatta Petros is one of 21 Ethiopian female saints, six of whom have hagiographies. The saint's hagiography, G√§dl√§ W√§l√§tt√§ PÃ£e·π≠ros, was written down in 1672, thirty years after the saint's death. The author was a monk named G√§lawdewos. He wrote it by collecting multiple oral histories from the saint's community, as well as adding his own thoughts. It has three parts: the biography, the miracles that happened to those who called on her name after her death, and two hymns (M√§lk…ôÀÄa W√§l√§tt√§ Pe·π≠ros and S√§lamta W√§l√§tt√§ Pe·π≠ros). Later, in 1769, others added more miracles, including those about the following kings: B√§kaffa, Iyasu II, IyoÀÄas I, Ras MikaÀÄel S…ô·∏•ul, Yo·∏•ann…ôs II, T√§kl√§ Giyorgis I and Tewodros II. Over a dozen manuscript copies were made in Ethiopia. The first print edition was published in 1912, based on one manuscript. The first translation into another language, Italian, was published in 1970, In 2015, the first English translation was published, which included color plates from the parchment manuscript illuminations of her life, and in 2018 a short student edition was published.  Scholarship  Little was published on Walatta Petros in Western scholarship before the 21st century. Written before the corrected, full edition based on 12 manuscripts was published in 2015, incorrect information about her (i.e. birth and death dates, children, travel, and hagiography) appears on these websites, encyclopedia entries, histories, and journal articles: one published in 1902 in Russian and another in 1943 in Italian. More has been published in the twenty-first century, almost entirely in English. The first was written by the French art historian Claire Bosc- Tiess√©, who conducted field research at monasteries on Lake ·π¨ana about the creation of a royal illuminated manuscript of G√§dl√§ W√§l√§tt√§ PÃ£e·π≠ros. The Russian historian Sevir Chernetsov published an article arguing that Walatta Petros was a non-gender-conforming saint. The American literary scholar Wendy Laura Belcher argued that Walatta Petros was one of the noble Ethiopian women responsible for the defeat of Roman Catholicism in Ethiopia in the 1600s. Some journalism has been published about the saint as well. Controversy has attended the English translation of the G√§dl√§ W√§l√§tt√§ PÃ£e·π≠ros, starting in October 2014 after one of the co-translators, Belcher, started giving talks about the saint's relationship with Eheta KristosWendy Laura Belcher, ‚ÄúSame- Sex Intimacies in an Early Modern African Text about an Ethiopian Female Saint, G√§dl√§ W√§l√§tt√§ PÃ£e·π≠ros (1672),‚Äù UCLA, October 27, 2014. and due to news coverage of the translation.Allison Flood, ‚ÄúEarliest Known Biography of an African Woman Translated to English for the First Time.‚Äù The Guardian (December 3, 2015).Allison Miller, ‚ÄúThe Saint Who Sent the Jesuits Packing: A New Translation of an Ethiopian Manuscript Sheds Light on African Women's Anticolonialism,‚Äù Perspectives on History (November 2015) Members of the Ethiopian Orthodox T√§wa·∏•…ôdo Church have stated online that ‚Äúthis book claims Walatta Petros is a lesbian‚Äù@African_HornET Twitter, December 8 2015 and have written many comments about sexuality on a Guardian article about the translation. Belcher has published a rebuttal on her websiteWendy Laura Belcher, ‚ÄúControversy over Sexuality in the Gadla Walatta Petros‚Äù (December 9, 2015) and published a scholarly article on the topic of same-sex sexuality in the hagiography. In 2020, an academic, peer-reviewed rebuttal was published by Ethiopian scholar Dr. Yirga Gelaw Woldeyes about Belcher's translation in the Journal of Afroasiatic Languages, History and Culture. The article asserts that Belcher and Kleiner clearly lack a proper understanding of the Ge'ez language as they misinterpret much of the relevant original work without proper contexts to push an orientalist and racist narrative of a sex-driven violent African woman. In his article titled Colonial Rewriting of African History: Misinterpretations and Distortions in Belcher and Kleiner‚Äôs Life and Struggles of Walatta Petros, Woldeyes notes that Belcher does not read or speak Ge‚Äôez and simple translation errors in their translation suggest that neither Belcher nor her co-translator Michael Kleiner has the fluency required to accurately interpret the language, and particularly intricate texts such as hagiographies, despite claiming that their goal is to render it as close as possible to the original text.. In October 2020, numerous scholars of Ge'ez language, researchers of African History, and professors from all 6 continents whose work is closely related to African History and Literature submitted an open letter to Princeton University, Princeton University Press, and Princeton University President Christopher L. Eisgruber to protest colonial appropriation of texts and urge the university to cease support to this translation and forthcoming works by Professor Belcher.  Notes  :1.This is a portrait of Walatta Petros that appears in the manuscript created between 1716‚Äì1721 (and cataloged in different sources as EMML MS No. 8438, Tanasee 179, EMIP 0284, and MS D in the Belcher-Kleiner translation) and was previously found in the saint's monastery Q ∑√§ra·π≠a on Lake Tana in Ethiopia.

It continued at the 48th Street Theatre November 11, 1934 ‚Äì January 5, 1935. On February 7, 1935, the play began a run at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood, with Calleia, Joseph King and Robert Middlemass reprising their Broadway roles.

Praising Boris Aronson's set design and the performances of Ilka Chase, Myron McCormick, Elspeth Eric, Joseph King and Robert Middlemass, he reserved his highest praise for the featured actor: \\"Joseph Spurin-Calleia as the prisoner plays with such keen authenticity and such sensitive understatement of emotion that his scenes are enormously moving. Type casting becomes an art when an actor can draw so much pulsing truth out of a character.\\" The Stage magazine wrote that \\"there have been few gangsters of the heartbreaking calibre of Joseph Spurin-Calleia's Tony Mako. To this excellent, rather quiet melodrama with its paucity of dead bodies, he gives a sure feeling of impending catastrophe.\\" Gallery Photographs of the original Broadway production of Small Miracle appeared in the November 1934 issue of The Stage magazine.

Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was a Caldecott Medal Honor Book in 1939. The book is a twist on the classic tale of Snow White by the Brothers Grimm. Since then it has been republished several times, including in 1999, 2004, and 2013.  Background  After the success of Walt Disney's film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, author Anne Carroll Moore suggested that G√°g retell the story of Snow White in a manner more faithful to the original Brothers Grimm story. Gag translated the text from the German and designed the illustrations.  Description  The book is printed in white and black. The cover depicts a young girl with black hair looking out the window of a small red house.\\"Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs (Fesler-Lampert Minnesota Heritage).\\" Amazon. N.p., n.d. Web.  Synopsis  A queen, used to being \\"the fairest one of all\\", is turned green with envy when her magic mirror says that her seven-year-old stepdaughter, Snow White, is now the fairest one of all. With fury the queen demands a huntsman to take Snow White into the woods, kill her, and bring back a token as proof of her death. Once in the woods, Snow White pleads with the huntsmen not to hurt her, assuring him that she'll run away and never return. The huntsman agrees and brings a wild boar heart to the queen as a token. Snow White runs until she discovers a small wooden hut, inside of which are found objects in septuplicate. Snow White falls asleep on one of the little beds, and is later awoken by seven dwarfs. They agree to let her stay if she becomes their house keeper. Later, when the evil queen asks her magic mirror, \\"Mirror, Mirror, on the wall, Who's the fairest one of all?\\" the mirror answers \\"Thou art very fair, Oh Queen, But the fairest ever seen Dwells within the wooded glen With the seven little men.\\" Angered, the queen dresses in rags and paints her face to conceal her identity. She travels to the glen and convinces Snow White to eat an apple that she has secretly poisoned, despite protestations from the dwarfs. Snow White is poisoned and appears to die; the dwarfs fashion a glass casket and place her inside. Years pass by, and one day a young prince walking through the forest spots Snow White in the casket. He begs the dwarfs to let him take her to the castle, after much pleading they agree. On the way to the castle the men rock the casket and a piece of the apple is dislodged from Snow White's throat. She awakens and the prince makes her his bride. The queen is forced to dance until death as punishment. Snow White, her prince, and the seven dwarfs live happily ever after.\\"SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWAR.\\" Gutenberg.ca. Project Gutenberg Canada Ebook, 2007. Web.

It occupies part of two counties, Dalanjargalan and Airag. The nature reserve has an area of about and was established in 1996. It consists of rocky outcrops surrounded by dry grassland and semi-desert steppe and is one of the places in which the rare argali wild sheep can be found. The reserve The reserve lies about southeast of Ulaanbaatar. It features a region of rocky outcrops in a predominantly arid steppe area. Between the rocks there are clefts and ravines, and many abandoned mines, and there are springs and ponds in the Ikh Nart Valley. Willows and elms grow in sheltered positions and the area provides shelter for livestock in winter. Flora There are more than two hundred species of plant in the reserve. Grasslands, shrubby areas, valleys and rocky outcrops are among the habitat types found in the locality, and the balance of the plant species depends much on whether it is a wet year or a dry one. In a wet season Allium species tend to predominate, along with fringed sagewort (Artemisia frigida) and other sagebrush species (Artemisia). In dry years the dominant vegetation is grasses including feather grasses (Stipa spp.) and wheatgrasses, and shrubs such as Caragana and the Gobi apricot. Fauna Thirty-three species of mammals have been recorded in the reserve. It is home to several ungulates including argali sheep, Siberian ibex, goitered gazelle, Mongolian gazelle and Asiatic wild ass. Several of these are threatened or endangered. Carnivores include marbled polecat, European badger, corsac fox, red fox, grey wolf, Pallas's cat and Eurasian lynx. Among the smaller mammals present in the reserve are jerboas, gerbils, voles, hamsters, long-tailed ground squirrels, tolai hare, Mongolian pika, hedgehogs and bats, and the long-tailed dwarf hamster (Cricetulus longicaudatus) has recently been added to the list. Three species of snake have been recorded; Pallas's coluber, slender racer and Central Asian viper, and three lizards; variegated toadhead agama, Mongolian racerunner and multi-ocellated racerunner. The reserve has been designated by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area. Among the 125 species of bird that have been recorded in the reserve are Himalayan vulture, cinereous vulture, eagles, buzzards, kites, hawks, sandgrouse, owls, wildfowl, and a wide range of resident and migratory passerine birds.

As a teenager he worked in a warehouse and used his lunch breaks to play a piano nearby. His bosses discovered his talent by accident and decided to pay for his musical education. He joined Juilliard School of Music in New York (where also Nina Simone initially trained as a classical pianist) and at the end of his studies he wins the 'Loeb price' for 'overall excellence in graduate studies'.Berlingske Aftenavis, 1957 (Exact date unknown. Article from late September. Written in advance of concert at Odd Fellow Pal√¶ 1 October. Author indicated as 'Toby') After a brief period of study at Lincoln University in Missouri (a place he would return to) he continued his studies with the music pedagogue Nadia Boulanger in Paris from 1951 to 1954.Brown, Charles S. http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/eugenehaynes (visited Nov 2015) After his stay in Paris, Haynes continued seeking a breakthrough as pianist. Sponsored by the USA Information Service he went on a concert tour in Europe. During the 1950s he stayed for extensive periods in Denmark nurturing a close friendship with the writer Karen Blixen whom he met in 1952. Haynes was in regular contact with her with her until her death in 1962. In between his stays and concerts in Europe he also performs in the US. He debuted in Carnegie Hall in New York in 1958 and played there again in 1969. However, Haynes spent most of his career teaching and composing. He is Artist in Residence at Lincoln University (where he studied briefly after his longer stay at Juilliard in New York) from 1958 to 1974. He wins another prize in 1974 given by 'National Association of Negro Positions' and at this time also returned to St Louis, his birthplace, to contribute to the education of young music talents in his childhood neighbourhood. During 1965 to 1973 he hosted a local AM radio show. In 1979 he became leader of a Centre for Performing Arts at Southern Illinois University in East St. Louis. Finally, a CD was released in 2004 at a time where he also continues performing. He died in 2007 at the age of 80. The best-documented period of his life and career is 1952 to 1962, notably through his memoirs published in 2000 which contains letters and diaries from those 10 years. In addition, a temporary exhibition in Drag√∏r, Denmark in 2012, also documented his life in Denmark during the 1950s.  In Europe in the 1950s  Eugene Haynes was introduced to the Danish writer Karen Blixen (also known under the pseudonym Isak Dinesen) by a Danish journalist, Bent Mohn, whom Haynes met during his studies in Paris. Haynes had crossed continents for work and adventure in the midst of the Cold War, and now with a base in Denmark, he continued to nurture his friendship with Blixen and her secretary, Clara Selborn, from 1952 and over the next ten years until Blixen's death in 1962. Over many holidays and work trips in Denmark, he used Selborn's house in the small fishing village of Drag√∏r, located south of Copenhagen (while Selborn stayed with Blixen in Rungstedlund), to practice the piano, study music, and in between, travel around Europe giving concerts.Berlingske Aftenavis, 1957 Article about Eugene Haynes in the Danish 'Billed Bladet' 26 July 1957 Haynes' period in Europe (1952‚Äì1962) was reopened for the public upon the publication of his diaries and letters in 2000; To Soar With Eagles. The European Travels ‚Äì Remembrances of Isak Dinesen. In addition, a suitcase belonging to Haynes containing clothes and other objects was found at Clara Selborn's house in Drag√∏r after her death in 2008. The contents of the suitcase was then turned into a temporary exhibition at the local Drag√∏r Museum, in 2012, along with other objects placed in a model of Selborn's house. The museum had five short films produced: \\"The Pianist Eugene Haynes in Drag√∏r, Denmark, and the World\\" (translated from Danish). The films which are narrated by curator Ingeborg Phillipsen are available on the museum's website, www.museumamager.dk, and YouTube. In the 1950s, Haynes was sponsored by the USA Information Service program, which aimed at improving America's image abroad and countering Eastern European political and cultural influence. Given that the Cold War was \\"cold,\\" it also became a battle of culture. Racial segregation and discrimination was a sensitive topic in the US, where the civil rights movement, formed half a century before, was about to gain new momentumH√∏g Hansen, Anders. ‚ÄúA Reading Room of the Civil Rights Movement,‚Äù ComDev portal mah.se/comdev, 2012H√∏g Hansen, Anders. Bob Dylan 1961‚Äì1967: K√¶rlighed, krig og historie Copenhagen: Frydenlund, 2012. The Information Service tried to promote the US as a non-discriminating nation, and with Haynes, they could show that Blacks do have opportunities, even as classical pianists. At the time, the terms black and classical pianist may have seemed mutually exclusive. Classical music was a trade of artistic work almost solely reserved for whites; black musicians were more commonly known to play soul, jazz, and blues. The Information Service was also trying to sell a culture-rich nation ‚Äì a USA which was more than just Hollywood, cartoons, and Coca-Cola ‚Äì which has classical musicians just as talented as in Europe. A breakthrough was difficult. Haynes himself engages with this in his diaries and letters from 1952 to 1962, To Soar With Eagles, published later in his life, in 2000.  On Karen Blixen  Eugene Haynes with Karen Blixen at her home in Rungstedlund, Denmark, ca 1957 On the difficulties of achieving a break through as a classical pianist, Eugene Haynes wrote in one of his letters home that for his high school classmate and friend, the Black jazz musician Miles Davis, the situation was different. As Haynes said to him once in France, \\"He (Miles) was entering a world where no one would question his right to function. This is still far from true where black African instrumentalists are concerned (in the States) which is why I spend as much time away from home as possible\\"(letter to brother, 1957, page 76) The letters and diaries reveals the warmness of his friendship with Blixen. In a diary entry titled \\"First meeting\\" Haynes writes about a walk with Blixen: \\"Along the way she talked about the many discussions she and Finch-Hatton had had on music. I asked if she had the gramophone he gave her in Africa. She was happy to show it to me when we returned to the house . . . As we said good bye, I made a quip about being a 'bit of Africa sent out' to her\\". (p. 28‚Äì29) Haynes wrote in his diary about his first meeting with Blixen: \\"I have seldom been so curious about anyone.\\" He further writes of Blixen, \\"She was a lady of La Belle √âpoque, one of the last of the great femmes du monde ... Had she said she had dined at the Caf√© Procope with Diderot and the Philosophes (public intellectuals of The Enlightenment), I would have believed her\\". (p 28) Haynes further quotes Blixen, who told him, \\"You'll have to be patient while you grow into your grace\\" (p. 104). Haynes was a young man of around thirty and working for a breakthrough. By her embracing him (as a matron?), despite obvious differences, she also grounded them in a shared experience: \\"In some ways we are both outsiders. I in Denmark, you in the land of your birth.\\" Haynes reflects on his relationship with her: \\"When Karen Blixen is interested in what you are saying, she can fix you with an almost hypnotic gaze and you are then convinced that you are at that time the most important person she knows, and what you are saying is of great moment. It is her most endearing trait\\" (p63).Haynes, 2000 Haynes found Denmark open and hospitable, but he also encountered stereotypes and racism. A university professor from America visiting Blixen referred to \\"the accent of our nigras\\" while at the table, and Haynes describes the situation and his discomfort in detail. Blixen had not heard the remark, but detected something was wrong. When she later asked about what happened, she was \\"enraged\\" about the guest's behaviour after Haynes had explained (p. 201‚Äì2). Nevertheless, there were many other much more enriching gatherings and conversations, and Haynes' delight in these meetings with Blixen shines through. At a dinner in 1961, Blixen suggests a game where each guest is assigned a famous intellectual, writer, or actor/actress. Haynes had given Blixen the witty French philosopher, Voltaire, and a woman with the name Birthe got Casanova. Haynes reveals fragments of the discussion in the diaries: Casanova had insisted on superstition as necessary, whereas Voltaire (The Enlightenment man) had favoured to free men of the \\"monster of superstition,\\" arguing that liberty and superstition could not go hand in hand\\" (p180). In between dinners like these, Haynes could be found in blue overalls and blue trainers among the geese of Drag√∏r and occasionally hanging out with fishermen at the harbour. The connection to Drag√∏r and a suitcase belonging to Haynes found at Selborn's house in 2008 leads to a local museum exhibition and another exposition of Haynes early life.  Suitcase found in Drag√∏r  \\"The Suitcase ‚Äì A metaphor for willing and unwilling travellers\\"Odumosu, Temi.

The suitcase contained ordinary everyday-use belongings, like shoes and trousers and a few books ‚Äì as well as keepsake objects like dried flowers in a frame. Haynes apparently wore dark blue jeans overalls in Drag√∏r. There are blue trainers/shoes, and a hat that, according to a 1957 article written in a popular gossip magazine, Billed Bladet, (\\"The Picture Magazine\\") made him look like the local fishermen ‚Äì and maybe the bohemians he hung out with as well, one could add. There are books, two refined leather cases, a pipe instrument, various paper clips, and reviews as well as photos and PR material from his tours. The Billed Bladet magazine and article is there too. A Black American female tourist is on the front, and there are more rarities inside. The vocabulary is not surprising for the time: 'Der bor en neger i Drag√∏r,' the headline states (\\"There is a negro living in Drag√∏r\\"). \\"From now on, your name is Hans.

He frequents not only Karen Blixen's home north of Copenhagen in Rungstedlund, but also hangs out with locals like the Drag√∏r- based poet, J√∏rgen Gustava Brandt, who Haynes describes as \\"a real Casanova\\" in a letter to his brother (p. 77). Gustava teaches Haynes Danish, a language which he came to speak alongside French. In the suitcase, there is a book on German grammar and an anthology of literature (with one text by Blixen). When it came to music, critic Isador Phillip called Haynes \\"one of the greatest musical talents America has produced.\\"(cover)). Seen in that light, it is a pity that the only CD that came out late in his life is not really seen as proving and showing his talent, the curator, Ingeborg Phillipsen, has indicated, referring to conversations with reviewers and musicians in the same field.

Bainum Jr. (born March 25, 1946) is an American businessman and politician. Bainum is chairman of Choice Hotels International, Inc. Since the 1980s, Bainum has led a number of enterprises including four current or former publicly listed companies: Choice Hotels; HCR Manor Care, which operates nursing and assisted living facilities; Vitalink Pharmacy Services; and Sunburst Hospitality. Bainum has also held political office, having served as a Democrat in the Maryland General Assembly. Bainum was a member of the Maryland House of Delegates from 1979 to 1982 and the Maryland Senate from 1983 to 1986. Early life and education Stewart W. Bainum Jr. was born March 25, 1946, and raised in Takoma Park, Maryland. He was the second of four children born to Stewart W. Bainum Sr., who was the founder of what became Choice Hotels and HRC Manor Care, and Jane Goyne. Bainum began working for his father's business at age 12 during summer breaks. Bainum was educated at Takoma Academy, where he was president of his senior class. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree in history from Pacific Union College in Napa Valley, California, in 1968. At Pacific Union, Bainum served as president of the campus student association. He received a Master in Business Administration from the UCLA Anderson School of Management in 1970, and taught at Southern College in the Tennessee River Valley. After UCLA, Bainum studied theology at Andrews University in Berrien Springs, Michigan, for 18 months from 1971 to 1972. Business career Bainum joined his father's Manor Care business in 1972 as the director of development and became senior vice president two years later. In 1977, Bainum and his father created a five-year strategy to grow the business' nursing home development through a series of acquisitions and became the first nursing home operation with a corporate marketing department. The Washington Business Journal called Bainum the \\"quarterback of the company's expansion strategy\\". From 1972 to 1985, the company's net worth increased from $8 million to $767 million. Seven years after Bainum introduced its mergers and acquisitions plan, Manor Care annual revenues increased from $31 million in 1976 to about $500 million. Bainum led an unsolicited tender offer for Hillhaven Corporation in 1979. Manor Care, a company with a net worth of about $10 million in the late 1970s, gained ownership of 55 percent of Hillhaven's common stock, and sold it a year later making $5 million. Bainum led Manor Care's acquisition of Quality Inns, Inc., in 1980. In 1981, Manor Care acquired Cenco, a private-pay nursing home chain, tripling its size. By 1983, Manor Care became the United States' second-largest nursing home company. Bainum took over for his father, becoming chairman and CEO in 1987. With Bainum as chairman and CEO, the company spent $280 million to build 39 nursing homes over four years from the late 1980s into the 1990s. Bainum brought in executives from Marriott and The Walt Disney Company, including Disney's Chuck Shields, to bolster management, develop new human resources strategies and redesign compensation packages. Bainum instituted programs to reduce turnover of nursing care facility administrators and expanded Manor Care's subacute care facilities in the 1990s to take advantage of a trend in \\"dehospitalization\\". The Washington Business Journal credited Bainum with \\"turning the low-key company into a billion-dollar enterprise\\" and the hotels division, which became known as Choice Hotels, became the world's second- largest hotel franchisor. Of the 209 largest family influenced, publicly held companies from 1976 to 1996, the Bainums' Manor Care generated the second- highest average annual shareholder returns, second behind Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway. The company spun off its hotels business in 1996. As of 2017, Bainum remains chairman of Choice Hotels. Bainum joined the leadership team of Quality Inns, which later became Choice Hotels, in 1977. Since then, the company has grown from 240 Quality Inn hotels to more than 6,500 properties under 11 hotel brands in more than 40 countries. George Washington University's School of Business and Public Management named Bainum CEO of the year in 1997, citing the company's annual revenue growth from $500 million to 2.4 billion under his leadership. In 1998, Manor Care merged with Healthcare and Retirement Corporation to create a company with a combined value of $4 billion. Bainum was chairman of HRC Manor Care until 2001 and left the board in 2002. As of March 2017, Bainum is the manager of Artis Senior Living and is on the advisory board for SunBridge Capital Management, LLC. Bainum has also held leadership posts with Vitalink Pharmacy Services and Sunburst Hospitality. In 2019, Bainum received a Lifetime Achievement Award for his work in hospitality, from the Americas Lodging Investment Summit. The following year, he received the 2020 John E. Anderson Distinguished Alumni Award from UCLA Anderson School of Management. Political career Bainum, who was described by Forbes as a \\"fiscal-minded Democrat\\", served for eight years in the Maryland General Assembly. Bainum first ran for elected office in 1974, when he sought to unseat incumbent Maryland state Senator Victor Crawford. The Maryland Court of Appeals ruled that Bainum was ineligible to run, as he did not meet the state's residency requirements at the time. In 1978, he was elected to the Maryland House of Delegates, a post he held until 1982, serving on the Ways and Means Committee and chairman of its Transportation Subcommittee. In 1982, state Senator Crawford announced he would not seek re-election and endorsed Bainum's candidacy. Bainum won the general election against Republican Stephen Leventhal with more than 70 percent of the vote. He served as state senator of Maryland's 20th District from 1983 to 1986, serving on the Budget and Taxation Committee, the Joint Committee on Budget and Audit, the Subcommittee on Corrections and Transportation, and the Capital Budget Subcommittee. Bainum's political career is best known for his successful efforts to end special tax breaks for private clubs, such as the all-male Burning Tree Club in Bethesda, Maryland. Bainum and his sister, Barbara Bainum, filed a lawsuit against the club. In 1984, as a result of the lawsuit, a Montgomery County, Maryland, judge ruled that Burning Tree must give up its $186,000 yearly real estate tax exemption if it does not allow women. In 1986, legislation he sponsored that barred private clubs that exclude women from receiving state tax breaks became law. This effort earned him \\"the hostility of Washington's politico-golfing community\\". As a Maryland lawmaker, Bainum sponsored a child support bill to require employers to deduct court-ordered payments, similar to how taxes are deducted, as well as legislation requiring public officials to disclose withdrawals from failed savings and loans, increase penalties for illegal handgun use, make information public on toxic substances and hazardous waste, increase fees on heavy trucks to offset road repair costs, and tax relief for low-income tenants. He received awards from Common Cause and environmental advocates. Bainum launched his campaign for Maryland's 8th congressional district in 1986, hoping to take the seat left vacant by incumbent Michael D. Barnes's run for U.S. Senate. Bainum bested a field of seven Democrats to win the party's primary. He lost in the general election to Republican Constance A. Morella. Bainum had considered a run for Maryland governor in 1994. The day before he had been scheduled to officially kick off his candidacy, Bainum announced he would not seek the office, choosing instead to focus on his family and businesses. Bainum was a supporter, 2008 Democratic National Convention delegate and fundraiser for President Barack Obama and endorsed Hillary Clinton in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Other roles Bainum is a member of UCLA's Anderson School of Management's Board of Advisors. He has served on the boards of trustees for University of Maryland Medical System, St. Mary's College of Maryland, Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, Johns Hopkins University and Bowdoin College. He was an honorary co-chair of Marylanders Against Handgun Use. In 2008, Bainum helped fund and unsuccessfully advocated against a 2008 referendum that legalized slot machines in Maryland. Personal life Bainum is married and has two children. Bainum first saw his wife, Sandy, while attending a play at the National Theatre, where she played the role of Annie in 42nd Street. Bainum called the theater to introduce himself to Sandy and they began dating shortly after. Bainum and his wife committed to The Giving Pledge, a campaign to encourage wealthy people to contribute a majority of their wealth to philanthropic causes, in September 2018.

This procedure joins the pulmonary artery and the aorta in situations where the systemic circulation is obstructed. It is commonly used when a patient has the combination of a small left ventricle and a transposition of the great arteries (TGA); in this case, the procedure allows blood to flow from the left ventricle to the aorta. History The DKS procedure is named for three physicians ‚Äì Paul Damus, Michael Kaye, and H. C. Stansel ‚Äì who independently reported the procedure in the literature in the 1970s. At that time, the procedure was used for patients who had TGA with a ventricular septal defect (VSD). By the late 2000s, the procedure was employed in situations where the right ventricle is bigger than the left ventricle and the left ventricle connects to the pulmonary artery instead of the aorta; examples include double inlet left ventricle, TGA with tricuspid atresia and TGA with hypoplastic left heart syndrome. The procedure In the original DKS procedure, surgeons separated the main pulmonary artery (MPA) just below the point where it divides into the right and left pulmonary arteries. The end of the MPA was then joined to the side of the ascending aorta, allowing blood from the left heart to communicate directly with the aorta. The procedure was later accomplished via a \\"double-barrel\\" technique that resulted in a new aorta with two valves. Later, a modified DKS was reported in which an aortic flap technique was utilized.

It is located just north of the Belt Parkway at Erskine Street and Gateway Drive, which is near portions of the Gateway National Recreation Area. Built as part of the Gateway Estates plan for commercial and retail development, it consists of two structures: the original structure opened in 2002 (now called Gateway Center South), and a second adjacent development opened in 2014 (called Gateway Center North or Gateway Center II). Location A Smashburger restaurant in Gateway Center North The Gateway Center complex, constructed under the Gateway Estates development plan for Spring Creek, is bounded by Erskine Street to the east, and a road now called Gateway Drive to the south and west, which follows the right of way of Seaview Avenue traveling east-to-west. An access road and parking lot form its northern boundary. It is located just north of the Belt Parkway and can be accessed by the parkway's Exit 15, which leads to Erskine Street. The original mall (Gateway Center South), which opened in 2002, consists of a complex, with a large parking lot and three separate structures to the south along Gateway Drive. It is anchored by several major stores, including Target, The Home Depot, Best Buy, and BJ's Wholesale Club. The newer northern complex (Gateway Center North), which opened in 2014, is similarly sized at , with a second parking lot, four small adjacent buildings for small outlets, a fifth structure for an Applebee's, and a sixth for a bank. Tenants of this section, which opened in stages in late 2014, include JCPenney, T.J.Maxx, ShopRite, and Aldi. The two-part complex was envisioned as a suburban-style strip mall. The southern complex was designed by GreenbergFarrow Architects. The northern complex was designed by GreenbergFarrow as well as the Perkins Eastman firm. Both main structures are designed in Georgian architectural style, with brick outer facades and green trim. GreenbergFarrow also designed Related's Gateway Center at Bronx Terminal Market. The mall is located north of the former Fountain Avenue Landfill, and was constructed on part of 230 acres of former landfill, which characterized Spring Creek for much of the 20th century. Located across Erskine Street to the east is the Brooklyn Developmental Center. Just north of the complex are Nehemiah Spring Creek and Gateway Elton, two affordable housing developments which were planned and constructed along with the mall as part of the Gateway Estates project. West of the mall across Hendrix Creek is Starrett City (now known as Spring Creek Towers), accessible via the Belt Parkway to the south, or Flatlands Avenue to the north. Spring Creek Educational Campus, which houses two New York City high schools, is also located north at Flatlands Avenue and Elton Street. Transportation The bus terminal at Gateway Center North. The mall is served directly by the and buses. Formerly terminating at Erskine Street near the Brooklyn Developmental Center, the B13, B83, and Q8 were extended to a new bus terminal area at the west end of Gateway Center North in August 2014. The B84, meanwhile, was created in June 2013 to serve the Spring Creek neighborhood. The closest New York City Subway stations to the mall are New Lots Avenue in East New York, served by the (connected by the B84 bus), and Rockaway Parkway in Canarsie, served by the . History The area that is now Gateway Mall, along with most of the Spring Creek neighborhood, originally consisted of marshland and creeks. The Milford Street Landfill existed on the site from the 1930s to 1950. Afterwards, the land remained vacant and was frequently used as illegal dumping grounds. The former landfill became known as the Vandalia Dunes due to its sandy landscape, and became a habitat for the Henslow's sparrow and other bird species. The area became the Fresh Creek Urban Renewal Area in 1967. In 1989, the tract was acquired by Starrett Housing Corporation‚Äîthe managers of Starrett City, which opened in 1974‚Äîfor mixed-income housing construction. Although this plan was to be the predecessor to the current housing program in the area, the land was never developed. On June 25, 1996, the New York City Council amended the original Fresh Creek Urban Renewal Plan to facilitate the development of the Gateway Estates plan, which included what would become the Gateway Center. Ground broke on the Gateway Center project on November 16, 2000. It was the first phase of the major redevelopment and restoration of the Spring Creek area (including the Gateway Houses, the Spring Creek Campus, and Spring Creek Park) that was originally proposed in the late 1980s, and part of an initiative to reduce crime and blight and create jobs in East New York. The 640,000 square-foot structure was planned as a suburban-style strip mall. characterized by brick facades and Georgian design features. It was developed by The Related Companies, which is also a development partner in two large Manhattan properties: the Time Warner Center at Columbus Circle, and the Hudson Yards Redevelopment Project. During the building of the mall, a new exit interchange for the Belt Parkway was constructed at the south end of Erskine Street at a cost of $25 million. It opened on October 1, 2002, at the cost of $192 million, and created 1,700 new jobs. As part of the project, Related Companies also constructed an addition to Spring Creek Park circumscribing the mall, opening on May 2, 2003. Following the mall's opening, several bus routes were extended to serve the area: the B13 in April 2003, the B83 in September 2007, and the Q8 in June 2008. In early 2007, Related Companies proposed the second phase of the Gateway Center, a similarly sized complex to the first phase, which would include an additional parking lot and bus terminal area. In March 2009, the New York City Council rezoned land to be allocated for the project. In 2010, it was reported that Walmart would be seeking to establish its first New York City location at Gateway, after years of local opposition. In spite of some polls that showed positive approval ratings for a Walmart location among residents of Brooklyn and the entire city, the plan was canceled due to opposition from local residents, and the developers signed ShopRite as an anchor instead. Construction on the expansion began in early 2014, opening in stages beginning on August 1 of that year. A third expansion is planned .

BlueTalon was founded in 2013 by Pratik Verma and headquartered in Redwood City, California. In July 2019, it was acquired by Microsoft.  Background  The company‚Äôs user access control technology was spurred out of a number of converging technology trends that drove the need for more data-centric security. These trends include: # The increasing amount of data that companies collect to run their business. # The emergence of innovative database technologies such as Hadoop and NoSQL that provide enterprises with an economically viable means to collect massive amounts of structured and unstructured information. # The unabated stream of cyberattacks that leads to bigger and more damaging data breaches. # The rapid adoption of cloud computing that pressures companies to rethink where they deploy computing and data resources. Funding BlueTalon is privately held and backed by Maverick Ventures, Signia Venture Partners, Data Collective, Arsenal Ventures, Biosys Capital, Bloomberg Beta, Stanford-StartX Fund, Divergent Ventures, and Berggruen Holding. Technology BlueTalon, Inc. takes a data-centric approach to security where the focus is on securing the data itself rather than the network used to access the data or the servers that host the data. The goal of the approach is to scale the protection of data, ensure consistency of data access policies across complex and hybrid data environments that include the cloud, meet regulatory compliance and enable the business by giving end users access to the data they need to perform their job. The BlueTalon technology decouples the authoring and management of security policies from the enforcement of these policies on data repositories. The underlying flexible and scalable architecture matches the complexity of today‚Äôs large enterprise environments (research shows that the majority of firms uses more than 50 different data sources for their analytics environment). This security approach allows a variety of database technologies to be supported, including Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark, NoSQL databases such as Cassandra, and traditional SQL-based repositories and can be deployed on- premises or in private and public clouds. The BlueTalon Data-Centric Security Platform applies the user rules and data access policies defined centrally by security staff to all data requests made by applications and users to only return a policy-compliant data set. Dynamic data masking capabilities prevents sensitive data from being visible by unauthorized users. Auditing lets security staff monitor data usage directly at the data layer for compliance and unusual behavior. Partnerships BlueTalon has partnered with big data and cloud computing companies such as Hadoop commercial distribution vendors and DataStax to help accelerate the adoption of big data in the enterprise and remove security as a barrier to adoption. BlueTalon announced its partnership and certification by Cloudera in August 2015. In July 2015, BlueTalon announced its partnership with Microsoft for the delivery of data-centric security for the deployment of Hadoop in Microsoft Azure HDInsight. BlueTalon is also available to Amazon Elastic mapReduce customers. Through these partnerships, joint customers will be able to more rapidly integrate data- centric security into the deployment of their big data or data lake initiatives.

After being beaten in his two starts as a juvenile in 1981 he was highly tried in the next two seasons racing sixteen times in 1982 and thirteen times in 1983. As a three-year-old he won three minor races before recording his first major victory in the Grade II Secretariat Stakes. He ended his season by beating a top-class international field in the Japan Cup at Tokyo Racecourse. In the following year he won the Grade III Seneca Handicap at Saratoga Race Course and ended his racing career by finishing a close fourth in his second Japan Cup. He was retired to stud in New Zealand and had some success as a breeding stallion. He died in 2001 at the age of twelve. Background Half Iced was a dark bay or brown horse bred in Kentucky by Mrs. Henry A. Gerry. He was sired by Hatchet Man whose wins included the Dwyer Stakes, Widener Handicap and Amory L. Haskell Handicap. His dam, the Virginia-bred Winter Memory was a descendant of the influential American broodmare Valkyr. During his racing career, Half Iced was owned by Bertram R. Firestone and trained by Stanley M. Hough. Racing career=1981: two-year-old season Half Iced made his racecourse debut when he finished sixth in a maiden race at Aqueduct Racetrack on 20 December 1981 and went on to finish eighth in a similar event at the same track eleven days later. 1982: three-year-old season Half Iced was highly tried as a three-year-old, racing sixteen times in ten months. At Aqueduct he finished third on his seasonal debut and then won a maiden race on March 1 before finishing second and third in two allowance races.

MacBeth explained that he had \\"saved power for the last dash\\" whilst Bertram Firestone commented \\"I am happy my horse won the race and that my wife's horse was third\\". 1983: four-year-old season Half Iced recorded one win from thirteen starts as a four-year-old in 1983. In his first seven races his best efforts came when he finished second in the W L McKnight Handicap at Calder Race Course in January and was placed third in a Belmont allowance in June. In August he moved to Saratoga where he finished fourth in an allowance before contesting the Seneca Handicap over one mile five furlongs. He recorded his first win for nine months as took the Grade III contest from Nice Pirate and James Boswell. He went on to finish third to Acaroid in the Manhattan Handicap, eighth in the Man o' War Stakes and fourth in the Louisiana Downs Handicap. On his final North American appearance he finished unplaced behind All Along in the Rothmans International Stakes on October 16. In November Half Iced returned to Tokyo to defend the Japan Cup. Ridden by Eddie Maple he finished fourth behind Stanerra, Kyoei Promise and Esprit du Nord, beaten less than a length by the winner. Stud record Half Iced was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion in New Zealand, based at the Paramount Stud in Hastings. His best winners included Sky Flyer (Brisbane Cup) and Ed (Wellington Cup). Half Iced died in New Zealand in 2001.

It was a hit in the Belgian hitparade in 1998 for 26 consecutive weeks. Biography Makin was born in England, and moved to Brussels in 1972 where he worked as a professional quantity surveyor. He became a professional folk and blues singer and guitarist in 1976, recording his first album, \\"Urban Romance\\", that same year. In 1980 he launched an independent record company OK Records, which was signed by Polygram and released his first single \\"Anglais Franglais\\" worldwide. In 1998 he scored a hit single with the number \\"Potverdekke! (It's great to be a Belgian)\\", which he wrote together with some Belgian friends. The song was so popular that he was allowed to perform it during the celebration of the national holiday in Brussels that year. He was also active as a member of the British United Football Club and a former captain of the club's first team, which plays in the Belgian amateur league. Makin kept performing up until his death in 2011, usually in the company of clarinet player Doctor Rob. He was married and had two sons from a previous marriage. After his death he was cremated.

(It's great to be a Belgian) is a 1998 novelty song, recorded by British singer John Makin, better known under his artist name, Mister John. It was his only hit song in his long career, making him a classic example of a one-hit wonder. The word \\"Potverdekke\\" is a curse word, typically associated with the region around Brussels. The word means \\"goddamned\\", but in older times people replaced the word \\"god\\" with \\"pot\\" (which means a pot) to avoid blasphemous curses. History The song is a joyful celebration of Belgium. It was created by Makin and some of his Belgian friends as a throwaway joke, but to their surprise became a huge hit in Belgium, spending more than 26 weeks in the national hitparade. This was especially amazing, seeing that the hit charted while the Dutroux scandal was in full effect and many Belgians at the time weren't in the mood for national pride. Mr. John was even invited to perform it during the National Holiday on July 21, 1998 before king Albert II of Belgium. The song also references the (then current) British mad cow disease in the line: \\"Now, the English egg and bacon is not so bad/ especially since all their cows went mad./ But if they never tasted mussels on the Grand Place down in Brussels/ it's no wonder they're feeling very sad.\\"  Belgian icons listed in the song All throughout the song Mister John names several iconic Belgian people, fictional characters, inventions, locations and brands. Among these are: * mayonnaise and frites (a reference to Belgian fries and moules-frites) * Duvel (a Belgian beer brand) * the saxophone (invented by Belgian born Adolphe Sax) * Tintin and Captain Haddock (characters from the internationally famous Belgian comics series The Adventures of Tintin.) * Hercule Poirot (a Belgian private detective, invented by British author Agatha Christie, whose stories were based in the UK.) * mussels (a reference to moules-frites) * The Grand Place of Brussels. * Kriek (a Belgian beer style) * The Schelde and the Meuse (major rivers which run through Belgium) * Leffe, Chimay (Belgian beer brands) *Lambiek (a Belgian beer style, typically known in English as lambic) See also * Belgitude ReferencesExternal links * 1998 songs English-language Belgian songs Novelty songs Belgian patriotic songs Songs about Belgium Brussels in fiction Cultural depictions of Belgian people ","title":"Potverdekke!

Yafeuh Balogun expressed the hope that the club would continue to grow and eventually become a mainstream gun-rights organization. Activity In August 2014, the Huey P.

Since then, Balogun reported that donations to the club have poured in from around the country, and their membership has more than doubled. The club staged another protest in October of the same year. In 2016, the coalition held a counter-protest at the Muhammad Mosque in South Dallas in response to a demonstration by the anti- Islamic Bureau of American Islamic Relations (BAIR). Both parties were armed and police were present during the protest, which ended shortly without any violence. Also in 2016, both Rakem and Yafeuh Balogun distanced themselves from the organisation. Rakem Balogun has cited the growing influence of the New Black Panther Party, whom he deemed a Black Separatist group, over the group as the reason for their departure.

The Linux 4.4 kernel is an example of an operating system kernel that supports open-channel SSDs which follow the NVM Express specification. The interface used by the operating system to access open-channel solid state drives is called LightNVM.  NAND Flash Characteristics  Since SSDs use NAND flash memory for storing data, it is important to understand the characteristics of this medium. NAND flash provides a read/write/erase interface. A NAND package is organized into a hierarchy of dies, planes, blocks and pages. There may be one or several dies within a single physical package. A die allows a single I/O command to be executed at a time. A plane allows similar flash commands to be executed in parallel within a die. There are three fundamental programming constraints that apply to NAND: (i) a write command must always contain enough data to program one (or several) full flash page(s), (ii) writes must be sequential within a block, and (iii) an erase must be performed before a page within a block can be (re)written. The number of program/erase (PE) cycles is limited. Because of these constraints SSD controllers write data to NAND flash memory in another order than the logical block order. This implies that the SSD controller must maintain a mapping table from host (logical) to NAND (physical) addresses. This mapping is usually called the L2P table. The layer that performs the translation from logical to physical addresses is called the flash translation layer or FTL.  Comparison with Traditional SSDs  Open Channel SSDs provide more flexibility with regard to data placement decisions, overprovisioning, scheduling, garbage collection and wear leveling. Open-Channel SSDs can, however, not be considered a uniform class of devices, as critical device characteristics such as minimum unit of read and minimum unit of write varies from device to device. One can therefore not design an FTL that automatically works on all Open-Channel SSDs. Traditional SSDs maintain the L2P table in DRAM on the SSD and use their own CPU for maintaining that L2P table. With Open Channel SSDs the L2P table is stored in host memory and the host CPU maintains that table. While the Open Channel SSD approach is more flexible, a significant amount of host memory and host CPU cycles is required for L2P management. With an average write size of 4 KB, almost 3 GB RAM is required for an SSD with a size of 1 TB.  File Systems for Open-Channel SSDs  With open-channel SSDs, the L2P mapping can be directly integrated or merged with storage management in file systems. This avoids the redundancy between system software and SSD firmware, and thus improves performance and endurance. Further, open-channel SSDs enables more flexible control over flash memory. The internal parallelism is exploited by coordinating the data layout, garbage collection and request scheduling of both system software and SSD firmware to remove the conflicts, and thus improves and smooths the performance.

Frear William Austin Whiting (August 5, 1855 ‚Äì January 18, 1908) was an American lawyer and politician of the Kingdom, Republic, and Territory of Hawaii. He served as Attorney General of Hawaii and was an associate justice of the Supreme Court of Hawaii. During his college years, he was captain of the 1875 Harvard Crimson football team.  Life and career  Whiting was born August 5, 1855, in Charlestown, Massachusetts. His ancestors included Massachusetts colonial governors Thomas Dudley and Simon Bradstreet, and Reverend John Cotton. He became a sixth generation Harvard College graduate, and served as captain of the 1875 Harvard Crimson football team. After graduating Harvard, he became a lawyer and practiced in Boston and Charlestown. Whiting resettled in the Hawaiian Islands in 1880 where his uncle James W. Austin was an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the Kingdom of Hawaii. He continued his law practice in Honolulu. In 1891, the newly enthroned Queen Liliuokalani appointed him as Attorney General succeeding Arthur P. Peterson of the hold-over cabinet from the reign of King KalƒÅkaua.; ; As a cabinet minister, he sat as a member of the House of Nobles, the upper body of the legislature of the kingdom. Considered a tool of the queen by her opposition, Whiting lost popularity for his defense of the controversial Marshal Charles Burnett Wilson, a favorite of the queen and subordinate of the Attorney General. Whiting resigned on July 27, 1892, and was replaced by Paul Neumann.; Trial of Queen Liliuokalani On January 11, 1893, he was appointed First Judge of the First Circuit Court. Six days later, the monarchy was overthrown by pro-American elements in Hawaii. Whiting continued his position under the successive new regimes. Following the unsuccessful Royalist counter- revolution, Whiting headed the military tribunal which sentenced Liliuokalani for misprision of treason. In this capacity, he was given the rank of Colonel by the Republic of Hawaii. The trial was held in the former throne room of the  ªIolani Palace. The deposed queen was defended by Paul Neumann. She claimed ignorance but was sentenced to five years of hard labor in prison by the military tribunal and fined $5,000. The sentence was commuted on September 4, 1895 to imprisonment in an upstairs bedroom of  ªIolani Palace.; ; Whiting continued working as a circuit court judge until his elevation to the Supreme Court. On January 11, 1896, he was appointed Second Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Hawaii succeeding the vacant seat left by the death of Richard Fredrick Bickerton. He held this position until the annexation of Hawaii and the organization of the Territory of Hawaii on July 14, 1900. After retiring from politics, he returned to his private law practice. Judge Whiting died on January 18, 1908; the cause of death was \\"dropsy caused by cirrhosis of the liver\\".  Personal life  He had a common-law marriage with Lizzie Nakanealoha (1853‚Äì1929), a Native Hawaiian and the daughter of Luahine Kahiliopua Manuel (1831‚Äì1910). They had three children: Lizzie Maunakapu Whiting (born 1885), who married Carlos A. Long; Ethel Hakula Whiting (born 1887) and Austin Whiting (born 1889). Her relationship with Whiting ended sometime after 1889. Nakanealoha remained a loyal supporter of Queen Liliuokalani. She served as the caretaker of Uluhaimalama, a garden planted by Liliuokalani after the overthrow in the Pauoa Valley of Honolulu, and brought flowers wrapped in newspaper to the queen during her imprisonment. Later sources attributed their separation to Whiting's involvement in the 1895 trial of the queen. However, by at least 1895, she had already been married to a man named John ManƒÅ and lived with him in the Pauoa Valley.

Early life  Paskvali was a member of noble family from Kotor. Members of this family, who were nobility of Tvrtko I of Bosnia, came to Kotor in 15th century. Ivan Paskvali was born in 1586 and baptised on 22 May 1586. His father was Kristofor de Dominis, son of Grisogon, and his sister was Cecilia.  Missionary activities  On 18 August 1641 Paskvali, then a missionary in Dalmatia, reported that his everyday activities included visiting and converting Orthodox Serbs to Catholicism. After Leonardi's death, Paskvali succeeded him in his missionary duties in Montenegro and Serbia, which marked the beginning of large-scale planned activities on Catholicisation of the Orthodox population of this region. In 1643 Paskvali reported that 7,000 \\"schismatic\\" (Orthodox) and \\"heretic\\" (Muslim) Serbs live in Montenegro. On 1 December 1645 he wrote a letter to the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith and requested four or five Catholic priests to be sent to the coast of Montenegro populated with Orthodox Serbs, for religious conversion purposes. He recommended that those priests first learn to speak Serbian and write using Serbian Cyrillic script. On 5 August 1646 Paskvali wrote a letter to the Sacred Congregation and informed them that Kotor bishop Viƒáentije Buƒáa convinced many people to accept Catholicism. On 29 April 1648 Paskvali reported from Grbalj that he had a lot of work due to the region being full of Serb newcomers who again applied for Venetian service. Paskvali maintained a very good relation with Orthodox bishop Makarije. In February 1665 Makarije wrote to the Congregation, praised Paskvali and requested that the Congregation should support Paskvali with money and books. In August 1665 the Congregation responded positively to those requests and sent books and money to Paskvali.

Holloway was named as the president of Rutgers University in January 2020 and assumed the position on July 1, 2020. He was the Provost of Northwestern University, a position he held between August 1, 2017 and July 1, 2020. Prior to that, he was the Dean of Yale College and Edmund S. Morgan Professor of African American Studies, History, and American Studies at Yale University. Early life and education Holloway was born in Hawaii and raised on military bases in Montgomery, Alabama and Maryland, while his father served in the United States Air Force. He was a star football player at Winston Churchill High School in Potomac, Maryland, and he was named an All-American honorable mention by USA Today. Holloway was recruited to play linebacker at Stanford University but graduated in 1989 without starting a game. While on Stanford's football team, he was a teammate of future U.S. Senator Cory Booker. He earned a Bachelor of Arts in American studies. Holloway earned a Ph.D. in history from Yale University in 1995. Academic career He began his academic career at the University of California, San Diego, before returning to Yale and joining its faculty in 1999. He became a full professor there in 2004. Holloway was appointed Master (now known as \\"Head\\") of Calhoun College in 2005 and chaired the governing body of Yale's residential colleges, the Council of Masters, from 2009 to 2014. As a Master, Holloway was respected for his approachability, charisma, and involvement in student life. For several years, he opposed the change of name of Calhoun, despite student demands, and noted the irony of his serving as the Master of that college; but he changed his mind as many students became more vocal in their opposition to the name in 2015. He was considered a candidate for dean of Yale College in 2008, though Mary Miller was eventually appointed. He was appointed as her successor in May 2014 by Yale President Peter Salovey, making him Yale's first black dean. During the protests regarding Halloween costumes at Yale in November 2015, while he was dean, Holloway strongly supported the costume guidelines issued by his office (guidelines which some critics saw as unnecessary), calling them \\"exactly right.\\" Holloway is a supporter of affirmative action programs and reparations (albeit not cash transfers). Holloway left Yale and became provost of Northwestern University on August 1, 2017. Holloway is the author of Confronting the Veil: Abram Harris Jr., E. Franklin Frazier, and Ralph Bunche, 1919-1941 (2002) and Jim Crow Wisdom: Memory and Identity in Black America Since 1940 (2013), both published by the University of North Carolina Press. He edited Ralph Bunche‚Äôs A Brief and Tentative Analysis of Negro Leadership (NYU Press, 2005) and co-edited Black Scholars on the Line: Race, Social Science, and American Thought in the 20th Century (University of Notre Dame Press, 2007). He wrote an introduction for a new edition of W.E.B. Du Bois‚Äôs Souls of Black Folk, published by Yale University Press in 2015. Rutgers University On January 21, 2020, Rutgers University announced that Holloway has been selected as the university's twenty-first president. He assumed the position on July 1, 2020, following the resignation of the university's previous president Dr. Robert L. Barchi. Holloway is Rutgers' first Black president.

Spiegel, and patriarch of the Spiegel family. Biography Spiegel was born in Abenheim, near the city of Worms in the Grand Duchy of Hesse, to a Jewish family, the son of Regina (n√©e Greenebaum) and Moses Spiegel, a rabbi. In 1848, his family (himself, three sisters, and his parents) immigrated to the United States via France in September 1848, fleeing growing anti-Jewish sentiment, revolutionary turmoil, and the fear that the government would punish them for the revolutionary activities of their firstborn son Marcus Spiegel, who had participated in an unsuccessful uprising against government troops in the state of Baden with Franz Sigel's liberal-democratic Landsturm regiment. They settled in the Jewish community on the Lower East Side of Manhattan where his father Moses sold needles, thread, and cloth. His mother died in 1849 and his father reverted to being a rabbi and teacher. His brother ‚Äì who the family thought was dead ‚Äì immigrated to the United States in 1849 but soon moved to Chicago, as did two of his sisters: Sarah Spiegel married Michael Greenebaum, the owner of a chain of hardware stores in Chicago; and Theresa Spiegel married Henry Liebenstein, a successful Chicago furniture merchant, in 1865. Joseph Spiegel worked as an apprentice in several retail stores in New York until 1862, and in 1863 he enlisted in the 120th Ohio Volunteers. He served in General Ulysses S. Grant‚Äôs army in Louisiana where he acted as sutler to his brother's regiment, witnessed his brother‚Äôs death in battle, and was later captured and sent to the prisoner of war camp at Fort Camp, Texas, where he remained until May 1865. He returned to Chicago where he entered the furniture business with his brother-in-law, opening a small furniture shop on Wabash Avenue named J. Spiegel and Company which sold Liebenstein furniture. In 1870, he assumed control of the Liebenstein business after marrying Liebenstein's niece, Mathilde Liebenstein. The Chicago Fire of 1871 destroyed his business, although he was able to quickly restart since most of his inventory had been stored at his undamaged house, which led to a boom as fire victims needed to repurchase furniture. In 1886, his sons, Modie and Sidney, joined the business. In the 1890s, as wealthy clientele moved to the suburbs and were replaced by immigrants, Spiegel shifted the company's strategy from selling high-quality furniture on a cash-only basis to cheaper furniture on credit. In 1903, his son Arthur joined the business and Spiegel started their mail order catalog business, becoming the first company to sell furniture by mail. By 1925, the fashion and furniture retailer had 10 million customers. Personal life Spiegel married Mathilde Lebenstein, the niece of his business partner, Henry Leibenstein. They had three sons, Modie Spiegel (b. 1871), Sidney Spiegel (b. 1872), and Arthur Spiegel (b. 1884), and three daughters. His son Sidney married the model Fay Lanphier. His grandson, Sidney M. Spiegel Jr. co- founded the Essaness Theatres chain with Edwin Silverman in 1929. One great- grandson, Paul Cowan, was a noted journalist, and another great-grandson, Geoffrey Cowan, is an influential academic and writer.

In the Carnegie Atlas of Galaxies, it is described as being \\"characterized by an irregular pattern of dust lanes threaded through the disc in an 'embryonic' spiral pattern indicating a mixed S0/Sa form.\\" It is located near the Big Dipper, a little to the north of the mid-way point between the stars Alpha Ursae Majoris and Delta Ursae Majoris. With a visual magnitude of 10.7, it can be dimly viewed using a aperture telescope. The visual dimensions of this galaxy are arc minutes, with the major axis having a position angle of 85¬∞. The galaxy is being viewed nearly edge-on, with an inclination of 18¬∞ to the line of sight from the Earth. It is moving away from us with a radial velocity of . The estimated visual luminosity of the galaxy is L‚äô, or 42 billion times the brightness of the Sun. Photographs show a tightly wound spiral pattern in the galactic disk, with three dust lanes‚Äîthe southern side of the galaxy appears dimmer due to the dust configuration. The mass of the free gas and dust in the galaxy is about M‚äô and M‚äô, respectively, with around M‚äô of the gas being in an ionized state. This is a type of active galaxy known as a LINER, which means that it shows emission lines of ionized gas in the region of its nucleus. Chemically, the stars at the center of the nucleus have a higher metallicity than in the neighboring regions. It appears that there is a tilted disk of stars orbiting the nucleus within a radius of . The galactic bulge itself appears triaxial with the ionized gas concentrated near the center of this bulge region. Images of the galaxy with the Hubble Space Telescope show a wispy disk of dust on all sides of the nucleus, with what appears to be the tendrilous remains of an ionization cone leading away 4 arc seconds to the northeast. Such features are common in Seyfert galaxies. On July 23, 2007, Type Ia supernova SN 2007gi was discovered by Koichi Itagaki near the central bulge of this galaxy. It reached peak magnitude around August 14, then steadily declined in brightness thereafter. Materials identified in the spectrum included silicon, calcium, and sulfur moving outward at velocities of around 15,500 km/s. This is a 50% higher velocity than what is normally observed with supernovae of this type. NGC 4036 is a member of the LGG 266 galaxy group, along with NGC 4041, IC 758, UGC 7009, and UGC 7019.

It has numerous traces of prehistoric occupation. Description Cosdon is a large, rounded hill that rises to . The first written record of the hill is to the Hoga de Cossdonne in 1240. The name Cossdonne seems to mean \\"Cost(a)'s hill\\", where \\"Cost\\" or \\"Costa\\" is the name of a person. The shape of the hill gives a false impression of size, and for many years Cosdon was thought to be the highest on Dartmoor. The surveyors of the Principal Triangulation of Great Britain took bearings that resulted in the first Ordnance Survey map of Dartmoor in 1809, which showed that Yes Tor was higher. However, in 1830 Samuel Rowe still wrote that Cawson or Cosdon hill was the highest in Dartmoor. An 1894 guide for cyclists going from Exeter to Launceston said, \\"So vast is the bulk of Cosdon that, were is not for the cloud mists that so often drift round his brow, one would hardly at first sight credit his height of 1799 feet.\\" It was formerly thought to be the highest point at , but it was now known that the neighbouring High Willhays was yet higher, at . From the summit of Cosdon it is often possible to see the English Channel from Teignmouth to Start Point, and on a clear day the Bristol Channel may be visible. The hill provides an excellent view over Dartmoor. As Thomas Clifton Paris wrote in 1865, \\"Far and wide stretch its desolate hills, the ancient haunt of wolves and wild deer, and barbarians as untamed ; a solitary wondrous region, everywhere darkened by morasses, but piled with fantastic rocks and glowing with innumerable tints.\\" History Triple stone row on North Tawton Common A Neolithic flint axe has been found at the western foot of the hill. There were nine Bronze Age settlements around the western edge of the hill and two associated reaves, or stone walls, that may have marked the boundaries between territories. There are also many stone cairns, kistvaens, stone rows and what may be a stone circle. Some of these have been badly damaged by stones being removed later for other uses. There is a very large cairn on the summit, which may well have been the site of a beacon. An 1896 report described three parallel lines of stones, starting from a cairn surrounded by a circle, on the North Tawton Common on the east side of Cosdon. The report noted that a wall was being built around a large slice of the common, and masons had been working for several years breaking up and removing stones for the wall. There were signs that an inner circle was buried in the cairn. Two kistvaens were found within the cairn. One was intact but the coverer and two side stones had been taken from the other. Dartmoor was called a forest in 1238. It was granted by Henry III of England to his brother, Richard, Earl of Cornwall and Poictou, in 1248. The extent of the Forest of Dartmoor was verified by the solemn oath of twelve Perambulators. The commissioners began their perambulation at Cosdon Hill in the north quarter of Dartmoor, then followed a circuit of the moor, returning to the starting point at Cosdon. Samuel Rowe (1793‚Äì1853), Vicar of Crediton, noted in 1848 that they started at a point near the foot of the hill called Hoga de Cosdowne, and said this must have been near the banks of the Taw close to Sticklepath. Arthur B. Prowse wrote in 1892 that the starting point must have simply been the summit of the hill. In the 1840s an adit was driven into the hill, and lodes of mispickel and copper ore were found. The shaft of the Ivy Tor Copper mine was sunk in 1851, and the mine continued to be worked for several years. By 1867 Ivy Tor had been united with Copper Hill to form Belstone Consoles, on the river Tavy. The mispickel at Ivy Tor contained bismuth. Actinolite and feldspar were also found at Ivy Tor. For some time the hill was a shooting moor for grouse and occasional deer. Some granite shooting butts can still be seen on the north and east of the hill. There is a trig point, Flush Bracket Number S5362, on the summit of the hill, from which a wide area of country can be viewed.

The attack was categorised as a case of religiously inspired terrorism by Europol, and has been reported by Europol as well as mappings by CNN and AFP as inspired by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). Perpetrator The attacker was identified as Bertrand Nzohabonayo, age 20, a French citizen and former rap musician born in Burundi in 1994, he was known to the police for minor crimes but was not on any watchlist. The attacker had taken Bilal as his new name upon conversion to Islam, and had been posting Islamist material on his Facebook page, including a photograph of the black flag of the Islamic State. In Burundi, police arrested the attacker's brother, a man with known Islamist sympathies and claimed that they had informed French authorities the previous year that both brothers should be regarded as suspect due to their extreme religious views. Motivation The Financial Times described the attack, along with the vehicle-ramming attacks on 21 December in Dijon and 22 December in Nantes as \\"the first ISIS-linked attacks\\" in France. According to The Globe and Mail, the attack was \\"apparently inspired by a video\\" circulated by ISIL calling on French Muslims to attack non-Muslims using vehicles. According to David C. Rapoport of the University of California, Los Angeles, these three attacks can be understood in the context of the rise of the Islamic State in Syria. \\"In September 2014, after the U.S. organized its airstrikes, the Islamic State‚Äôs chief spokesman called on Muslims in Western countries to find an infidel and ‚Äòsmash his head with a rock‚Äô, poison him, run him over with a car or ‚Äòdestroy his crops‚Äô. Two months later a video released in French contained virtually the same message and a series of strange 'lone wolf' attacks followed on three consecutive days, the perpetrators declaring ‚Äú'God is Great' in Arabic. Three policemen were stabbed in Jou√©-l√®s-Tours, and vehicles were used to run over eleven pedestrians in Dijon and ten in Nantes.\\" Aftermath This attack, and others, were described by CNN as part of a \\"drumbeat of terror\\" which struck France in the weeks preceding the Charlie Hebdo shooting. The attack was categorised as \\"religiously inspired terrorism\\" by Europol, as reported to them by France. Following this attack, the 2014 Dijon attack and 2014 Nantes attack, which officially were deemed unrelated, the French government heightened the nation's security.

It is a shrub which often has foliage covered with soft hairs, giving the plant a silvery grey hue and making it soft to touch. The leaves are strongly scented when crushed. Its flowers are usually greenish yellow in colour and have the stamens protruding from the ends. Dense-felted eremophila is common after fire, but becomes less so as others recover and compete with it. Description Eremophila subfloccosa is often a low spreading shrub, which usually grows to less than tall but can spread to about . Its leaves are usually wide and wide and are egg-shaped, elliptic or oblong. The leaves and branches are often densely covered, usually with more than one kind of soft hairs making the foliage soft to touch, although there is variation between subspecies. The foliage is often strongly scented when crushed. The flowers are yellow to green and occur singly in the axils of leaves on a stalk up to long which is covered with soft, white hairs. The flowers are tubular in shape, up to long, surrounded at their base by 5 sepals. They are not spotted and the four stamens extend beyond the tube formed by the petals. Flowering usually occurs in spring but often occurs also at other times and is followed by fruits which are glabrous, roughly spherical and in diameter. Taxonomy and naming Eremophila subfloccosa was first formally described by George Bentham in 1870 in Flora Australiensis. The specific epithet (subfloccosa) is from the Latin sub meaning \\"somewhat\\" or \\"almost\\" and floccosus, \\"floccose\\" referring to the stem and leaf hairs. Three subspecies have been recognised: * Eremophila subfloccosa Benth. subsp. subfloccosa which has low-lying or prostrate branches, grows to about high and wide and has leaves and branches densely covered with branched and glandular hairs, especially dense on the leaf margins; * Eremophila subfloccosa subsp. glandulosa Chinnock which is an erect, sticky shrub growing to between high and wide with its leaves and branches covered with mostly glandular hairs, although not dense on the leaf margins; * Eremophila subfloccosa subsp. lanata Chinnock which is an erect shrub growing to a height of with its leaves and branches covered with white, woolly hairs giving the plant a grey appearance. The epithet glandulosa is from Latin, meaning 'covered with hairs bearing glandular tips' and the epithet lanata is from the Latin 'covered with long dense curled and matted hairs'.  Distribution Eremophila subfloccosa occurs in semi-arid parts of Western Australia and in South Australia, mainly near the Eyre Peninsula. It grows in a range of soils, often near saline areas and on disturbed sites such as road verges. It often thrives after bushfire but suffers in competition from others as they recover after several years. Subspecies subfloccosa grows in sandy soils or laterite in disturbed areas between Hyden and Wongan Hills in the Avon Wheatbelt, and Yalgoo biogeographic regions. Subspecies glandulosa occurs in two disjunct populations. In Western Australia it occurs between Balladonia and Ravensthorpe in the Coolgardie, Esperance Plains and Mallee biogeographic regions. It is often found after bushfires and near roadsides whilst absent from nearby undisturbed bush. In South Australia it occurs in the Yorke Peninsula, Northern Lofty, Murray and Southern Lofty botanical regions. Subspecies lanata also occurs in two disjunct populations in two states. In Western Australia it grows in a broad area between Cue and Rawlinna in the Avon Wheatbelt, Carnarvon, Coolgardie, Esperance Plains, Geraldton Sandplains, Great Victoria Desert, Mallee, Murchison and Yalgoo biogeographic regions and is often found in sandy soils on plains and on the margins of salt lakes. In South Australia it occurs in the North-western, Flinders Ranges, Eyre Peninsula, Yorke Peninsula, South Eastern botanical regions. Use in horticulture The soft, silvery foliage of dense-felted eremophila make it a suitable garden plant. It grows best in drier areas, needs full sun and prefers alkaline, well drained soil. Propagation is easier from cutting than from seed but the use of mist will cause fungal problems.

Religious leader Ibrahim Haji Andalan Gidatlinsky twice before turned to the Shah of Persia, trying to persuade him not to conduct an unnecessary war with the Avar Muslims. Moreover, by Nadir Shah, according to legend, they were sent letters and legates from Andalal. Following the rejection by Nader, Qadi Pir Muhammad replied: \\"Now, between us can not be peace.

It was built from to 1930s. It is also known as Queen's Hotel. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The Hotel Childers was built in at least two stages in the late 19th and 20th centuries and is one of several hotels built to serve the prosperous and growing centre of Childers. Following logging of the dense Isis Scrub in the 1870s, Childers, in the heart of the scrub, was promoted in the 1880s by Maryborough interests, as an agricultural district. The land in the immediate vicinity of the present town of Childers was surveyed in 1882 into 50-acre farm blocks. There was no official town survey; Childers developed following the private subdivision of portions 870 and 871, at the railhead of the 1887 Isis railway line from Isis Junction railway station. This was opened in 1887, and was intended principally to facilitate the transport of timber from the scrub. The coming of the railway not only promoted the development of the town of Childers; it also proved the catalyst for the establishment of a sugar industry in the district in the late 1880s. At the opening of the railway, Robert Cran, owner of Maryborough's Yengarie mill, announced that he would erect a double crushing juice mill at Doolbi, to supply his mill at Yengarie. This was completed in 1890 and further expansion of the sugar industry in the Isis was closely related to the activities of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, which erected a central crushing mill in the district 1893-94. By 1895, at least three other mills had been established in the Isis, with another two under construction, and Childers had emerged as the flourishing centre of a substantial sugar-growing district: in the years between 1891 and 1900 the population grew from 91 to 4000. The growth of the Isis district in the 1890s is reflected in the series of hotels constructed in Childers to accommodate travellers, businessmen and the many seasonal workers in the sugar industry. In 1894 Elijah Kirby purchased land on the northern side of the main street and applied for a hotel license. In 1895 he took out a mortgage for , which is probably associated with the building of his hotel. This was a single storey timber building with a verandah along the front and side and was called the Queen's Hotel. Childers was then served by five hotels; the Childers Hotel, moved from Horton in 1887 and on the site of Grand Hotel, the Isis (1892), BelleVue (1895) and Royal (1895). The Palace Hotel was built in 1897 and in 1899 the two storey brick Grand Hotel was constructed. It was the only building to survive a disastrous 1902 fire that destroyed most of the buildings on that side of the main street. In 1902-3 the town centre was rebuilt with fashionable new brick buildings more in keeping with Childers' success. In 1903 the old Isis Divisional Board was abolished and Isis Shire proclaimed, with the new seat of municipal government moving from Howard to Childers. In 1907, the last of Childers Hotels, the Federal, was constructed. In 1898 the Queen's Hotel was leased to James Thompson for five years. He was to be the first of a large number of licensees, some of whom only ran the hotel for short periods. The hotel also changed hands a number of times, only some of the owners actually running the hotel. By the first decade of the 20th century Childers' other hotels were all two storied and it is thought that the ground floor of the Queen's Hotel was incorporated into a major rebuilding which added a storey to the building. The date at which this occurred is unknown, though changes may have occurred in 1909 when Hilmar Andresen purchased the hotel and borrowed to do so. However, the hotel had least a major refurbishment in the 1930s, as much of the joinery and detailing in the interior of the hotel is consistent with that date. In 1939, the name of the hotel was changed to the Hotel Childers, possibly to mark this change. The upper verandah was built in with fibrous cement sheeting for many years, but was reconstructed according to its original appearance in mid 2000. Refurbishment in recent years has also made some changes to the ground floor, including the installation of a gaming room. Much of the original detail remains, however.  Description  The Hotel Childers is a two storey building with an upper level balcony overhanging the street, between the National Australia Bank (the former Queensland National Bank) and the Childers RSL Club (former Commercial Banking Company of Sydney building), on the northern side of Childers main street, Churchill Street. The ground floor is constructed of timber boards and contains a bar, billiard room, lounge, gaming room and kitchens. Interwar detailing includes a timber staircase, which has been painted, plate rails, moulded ceilings and timber and glass doors and door furniture. The upper level is clad with fibrous plaster sheeting and has deep balconies at the front and rear. That at the front has timber balustrading and that at the rear has been built in with fibrous plaster sheeting and glass louvres. This floor contains a large central hall with corridors running off it to each side from which the publican's flat and guest bedrooms are accessed. The hall and four of the guest bedrooms open onto the front balcony. There bathrooms on the rear verandah. The walls are of vertical boards and the rooms are ceiled with fibrous sheeting and battens. Roofs are clad with modern metal sheeting and there is a beergarden and entertainment area to the rear of the hotel.  Heritage listing  Hotel Childers was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Hotel Childers is one of a group of hotels that demonstrate the rapid growth of Childers in the late 19th and early 20th century. As a provider of food, accommodation and entertainment, the number and size of hotels in a town were used as an indicator of the prosperity of a district. The hotel illustrates the unprecedented growth then occurring in the Isis, when Childers was emerging as the flourishing centre of a substantial sugar-growing district. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The Hotel Childers is hotel is a landmark in the main street that contributes to the architecturally coherent and picturesque townscape of Childers. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Hotel Childers is associated with the community of Childers as a public building that has formed part of the recreational life of the town for most of the 20th century.

Nurse midwives provide care of women across the lifespan, including during pregnancy and the postpartum period, and well woman care and birth control. Practice Nurse midwives can function as primary healthcare providers for women and most often provide medical care for relatively healthy women, whose health and births are considered uncomplicated rather than high risk, as well as their neonates. Women with high risk pregnancies can often receive the benefits of midwifery care from a nurse midwife in collaboration with a physician. The nurse midwife may work closely or in collaboration with an obstetrician & gynecologist, who provides consultation and assistance to patients who develop complications or have complex medical histories or disease(s). They provide health care for sexual health, as they also see women for routine exams and are able to initiate all types of contraception. Nurse midwives practice in hospitals and private practice medical clinics and may also deliver babies in birthing centers and attend at-home births. Some work with academic institutions as professors. They are able to prescribe medications, treatments, medical devices, therapeutic and diagnostic measures. They are able to provide medical care to women from puberty through menopause, including care for their newborn (neonatology), antepartum, intrapartum, postpartum and nonsurgical gynecological care.http://www.pacode.com/secure/data/049/chapter18/s18.4.html In some cases, nurse midwives may also provide care to the male partner of their female patient in areas of sexually transmitted diseases and reproductive health. In the United States, less than one percent of nurse midwives are men.

Data-centric security is evolving rapidly as enterprises increasingly rely on digital information to run their business and big data projects become mainstream. Data-centric security also allows organizations to overcome the disconnect between IT security technology and the objectives of business strategy by relating security services directly to the data they implicitly protect; a relationship that is often obscured by the presentation of security as an end in itself.  Key concepts  Common processes in a data-centric security model include: * Discover: the ability to know what data is stored where including sensitive information. * Manage: the ability to define access policies that will determine if certain data is accessible, editable, or blocked from specific users, or locations. * Protect: the ability to defend against data loss or unauthorized use of data and prevent sensitive data from being sent to unauthorized users or locations. * Monitor: the constant monitoring of data usage to identify meaningful deviations from normal behavior that would point to possible malicious intent. From a technical point of view, information (data)-centric security relies on the implementation of the following: * Information (data) that is self-describing and defending. * Policies and controls that account for business context. * Information that remains protected as it moves in and out of applications and storage systems, and changing business context. * Policies that work consistently through the different data management technologies and defensive layers implemented.  Technology =Data access controls and policies Data access control is the selective restriction of access to data. Accessing may mean viewing, editing, or using. Defining proper access controls requires to map out the information, where it resides, how important it is, who it is important to, how sensitive the data is and then designing appropriate controls. Encryption Encryption is a proven data-centric technique to address the risk of data theft in smartphones, laptops, desktops and even servers, including the cloud. One limitation is that encryption is not always effective once a network intrusion has occurred and cybercriminals operate with stolen valid user credentials.Encryption solutions with multi-factor authentication are much more effective in preventing such access. Data masking Data Masking is the process of hiding specific data within a database table or cell to ensure that data security is maintained and that sensitive information is not exposed to unauthorized personnel. This may include masking the data from users, developers, third-party and outsourcing vendors, etc. Data masking can be achieved multiple ways: by duplicating data to eliminate the subset of the data that needs to be hidden, or by obscuring the data dynamically as users perform requests. Auditing Monitoring all activity at the data layer is a key component of a data-centric security strategy. It provides visibility into the types of actions that users and tools have requested and been authorized to on specific data elements. Continuous monitoring at the data layer combined with precise access control can contribute significantly to the real-time detection of data breaches, limits the damages inflicted by a breach and can even stop the intrusion if proper controls are in place. A 2016 survey shows that most organizations still do not assess database activity continuously and lack the capability to identify database breaches in a timely fashion. Privacy-enhancing technologies A privacy-enhancing technology (PET) is a method of protecting data. PETs allow online users to protect the privacy of their personally identifiable information (PII) provided to and handled by services or applications. PETs use techniques to minimize possession of personal data without losing the functionality of an information system.  Cloud computing  Cloud computing is an evolving paradigm with tremendous momentum, but its unique aspects exacerbate security and privacy challenges. Heterogeneity and diversity of cloud services and environments demand fine-grained access control policies and services that should be flexible enough to capture dynamic, context, or attribute-based access requirements and data protection. Data-centric security in the public cloud environments In recent decades many organizations rely on managing database services in public clouds such as Amazon Web Services, Oracle Cloud, Google Cloud Platform or Microsoft Azure to organize their data. Such approaches have their own limitations on what users can do with managing the security of their sensitive data. For instance, hardware security appliances or agents running on the database servers are no longer an option. This requires innovative ways to secure data and databases such as using a reverse proxy sitting in between clients / applications and database servers. The requirements, such as supporting a load balancing, high availability and fail-over in data-centric security bring additional challenges that database security vendors must meet.

V. Prakash Kumar and Kriti Kharbanda in the leading roles, while Bala Saravanan, Ramdoss, Rajendran, Mansoor Ali Khan, and Anandaraj play supporting roles. The film was produced by Kenaya Films. The music was composed by G. V. Prakash Kumar with cinematography by P. V. Shankar. The film began production during July 2015 and was released on 17 March 2017. Plot Bruce Lee (G. V. Prakash Kumar) and his friend Abbas (Bala Saravanan) are good-for-nothing guys. An evil don named Ramdoss (Ramdoss) has a gang who throws acid on people. Bruce Lee is in love with Saroja Devi Suprajit (Kriti Kharbanda), a college-going student. Once, Ramdoss kills Minister Mansoor Ali Khan (Mansoor Ali Khan), and a photo of the killing is taken by Bruce Lee accidentally. With fear, Saroja Devi decides to give it to Mansoor‚Äôs son but comes to know that his son is involved in the killing, so she decides to give the evidence to her uncle, who is a lawyer. Unfortunately, her uncle also defends Ramdoss, and the commissioner asks Ramdoss to find who is shooting them. The next day, the girls are kidnapped by Ramdoss, and he demands the camera from Bruce Lee. Will Bruce Lee save Saroja forms the crux of the story. Cast *G. V.

V. Prakash Kumar had agreed to work with Prashanth Pandiraj on an action comedy film to be produced by Kenanya Films. The title of the film was changed in July 2015 from Baasha Engira Anthony to Bruce Lee, after the makers failed to acquire the relevant permission to use the title from the makers of Baashha (1995). During October 2015, the film had a brief legal tussle with the makers of the Telugu film of the same, Bruce Lee (2015), after they dubbed and released their film in Tamil as Bruce Lee 2. The team of the Tamil production, Bruce Lee, were unable to prevent the release of the Telugu version or its dubbed Tamil version. Samantha and then Trisha were approached to play the leading female role, but their unavailability meant that Kriti Kharbanda, who also appeared in the Telugu Bruce Lee, was signed on to make her debut in Tamil films. The team held a photoshoot in October 2015, with Kriti revealing that her and Prakash would portray college students. Production subsequently began later that month, with the makers targeting a release date in early 2016. Despite finishing the shoot in early 2016, the film was delayed to allow several of G. V. Prakash Kumar's other films have a theatrical release first. Soundtrack G. V. Prakash Kumar composed the songs, Arunraja Kamaraj, Mani kandan, Vairachandran, Gana Vinoth wrote the lyrics. Lahari Music released the album on 20 October 2016. Release Following multiple delays, Bruce Lee had a theatrical release on 17 March 2017. The satellite rights of the film were sold to Zee Tamil. The film was panned by the critics as well as audiences and ended up becoming a disaster at the box office. Vishal Menon of The Hindu wrote \\"you need a wicked sense of comedy and great actors to pull off this kind of screwball material, but, sadly, there‚Äôs not a single funny moment\\", while Thinkal Menon of The Times of India wrote \\"if spirits could watch films, the spirit of real Bruce Lee will turn into Kanchana and Chandramukhi after watching this absurd film\\". A reviewer from FirsPost stated \\"GV Prakash‚Äôs Bruce Lee would make the late legend turn in his grave\\" and that \\"the film, which was touted as a black comedy, is amateurish and has neither a story nor style\\". Further negative reviews were given to the film by The New Indian Express who stated it was a \\"comedy gone awry\\", while Sify.com noted that director \\"Prashanth Pandiraj has a half-cooked script that doesn‚Äôt know where to go after setting up its delicious premise\\". Baradwaj Rangan of Film Companion wrote \\"Bruce Lee is supposed to be a comedy. The key word supposed. It‚Äôs actually a tale of revenge.\\"  Reception = Critical reception  The film received mixed reviews from critics.

She was employed as a journalist at G√∂teborgsposten in 1864‚Äì1865 and G√∂teborgs Handels- och Sj√∂fartstidning in 1865‚Äì1889, where she wrote political articles and literary reviews and functioned as temporary chief editor during the absence of the regular chief editor, the progressive Sven Adolf Hedlund. Her media career was unique at the time and made her one of the first in the pioneer generation of women journalists in Swedish media. She always wrote under pseudonym. She was awarded by the Royal Society of Sciences and Letters in Gothenburg for her poetry in 1857. ;Works: # Brag, Eva (1858). Sigurd och Brynhilda: episkt f√∂rs√∂k efter V√∂lsungasagan.

The town of Isistown was surveyed by Fred. J. Charlton around the Isis Junction railway station and to the north of the Isis River (split across the present day localities of Isis River and Buxton). The first land sale of town allotments were held on 9 January 1886. The town was promoted as having many benefits including: * being the junction of the two railway lines * having a good river * having excellent timber * being in a district with rich agricultural potential * being prospected for coal fields A further land sale for Isistown was held on 5 June 1886, but today there is no evidence that any town was established in the area.

It is an affiliate of Ansar Dine. Origins and membership In March 2012, the President of Mali Amadou Toumani Tour√© was ousted in a coup d'√©tat over his handling of an insurgency in Northern Mali. As a consequence of the instability that followed, Mali's three largest northern cities‚ÄîKidal, Gao and Timbuktu‚Äîwere overrun by a mixture of Islamists and Tuareg Nationalists. By July, the Tuareg were pushed out by their former allies, and the area became dominated by Jihadist groups: Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), Ansar Dine, and the Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa (MUJAO). In January 2013, the Islamists captured the town of Konna in Central Mali, after fierce fighting with Malian forces. They were driven out by French forces days later, the start of a French-led military intervention known as Operation Serval. However, some fighters were able to retreat to hideouts in the mountains or deserts and regroup. Ethnic Fulani veterans of the conflict make up the core of the group. The Fulani are around 9 percent of Mali's population, but are locally dominant in the Mopti Region, which was the center of the 19th Century Fulani-led Islamic state of Macina. History The Macina Liberation Front first came to prominence in January 2015, when it claimed responsibility for attacks in central and southern Mali. The group's leader is Amadou Kouffa, a Marabout who had acted as commander for the Islamist militants in the 2013 Battle of Konna. The group has been responsible for attacks targeting United Nations peacekeepers, French troops and Malian government forces, as well as civilians. In March 2017, Amadou Kouffa appeared in a video, alongside leaders from the Saharan branch of AQIM, Al-Mourabitoun and Ansar Dine, in which it was announced that they were merging their organisations into a group called Jama'at Nasr al-Islam wal Muslimin. Kouffa was reportedly killed by the French Army in November 2018.https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-46331928 In February 2019, however, France 24 reported it had obtained a 19-minute long video that appeared to show him alive.  Links with other groups  On January 10, 2020, armed clashes took place between loyal members of Amadou Koufa and a some dissidents near the commune of Dogo within the Macina Liberation Front. Several points of disagreement have led a faction of dissidents affiliated with Mamadou Mobbo to criticize Amadou Kouffa for the mismanagement of natural resources. Two combatants of Katiba Macina were killed as a result of these confrontations. Mamadou Mobbo is one of those who helped Amadou Koufa to legitimize his fight in Macina, a region where Koufa is not originally from. In a video published at the end of January, the group of combatants led by Mamadou Mobbo defected by pledging allegiance to the Islamic State and its Caliphate Abu Ibrahim al- Hachimi al-Qourachi, thereby seeking recognition for the Islamic State.

There are four fragmentary manuscripts that have been grouped together from Cave 4: 4Q252, 4Q253, 4Q254, and 4Q254a which contain interpretations of the Book of Genesis. The most extensive of the manuscripts is 4Q252 which contains 6 fragments. They date from mid 1st century BCE (Hasmonean period) to late 1st century CE (Herodian period). They are all written in Hebrew on parchment.  4Q252  4Q252 or 4QCommentary on Genesis A, as it was called by the final editor George Brooke, is dated using a paleographical method back to the early Herodian era or the latter half of 1st century BCE. 4Q252 contains six fragments that hold most of the six column commentary or pesher of certain passages on Genesis. The six fragment hold an almost complete scroll on which was only written on one piece of parchment. For almost a decade two of the fragments was believed to be 4Q Patriarchal Blessings but J. T. Milik realized that those two fragments belonged with others as part of a single composition.  Physical Description  Due to the difference in the decomposition of the scrolls the actual size of the scrolls slightly decreases over time Fragment 1 approx. 20.3 cm x 13 cm Fragment 2 approx. 2.5 cm x 2.3 cm Fragment 3 approx. 3.8 cm x 3.6 cm Fragment 4 approx. 2.6 cm x 2.2 cm Fragment 5 approx. 8.3 cm x 4.5 cm Fragment 6 approx. 9.2 cm x 4.6 cm  Contents  There are 6 columns extant of 4Q252, some more fragmentary than others. Column I and II lines 1-7 mostly retell and expand slightly the story of Noah and the flood from Genesis 6-9. In this portion, the author was mostly concerned with including more dating details than appear in Genesis. Column II lines 8-14 and all of column III focus on the story of Abraham, including the judgement on Sodom and Gomorrah and the binding of Isaac. Column III is especially fragmentary, with several blanks. Columns IV-VI are based on Genesis 49, Jacob's blessing of his twelve sons. Column IV covers Jacob's blessing of Reuben. The author's comment on Jacob's blessing is an exclusively negative portrayal of Reuben.  4Q253  4Q253 (Commentary on Genesis B) consists of three fragments that were found in cave four at the Qumran site. The first fragment mentions the Ark of the Covenant and may deal with Noah and the flood, but the sense of the comments is far from clear. The second fragment is said to be associated with Jacob and his cultic activities. Fragment three cannot actually be placed specifically in relation to the Genesis text, however, it speaks of Belial ‚Äì the traditional name for Satan in Jewish apocalyptic writings.  Physical Description  The fragments are quite small in size and show the very bottom of columns on a commentary of Genesis. Unfortunately, due to the poor state of the fragments, scholars are unable to determine the size of what the full manuscript would have been. Frg. 1 = 3.1 x 3.9 cm Frg. 2 = 5.2 x 6.2 cm (two joined pieces) Frg. 3 = 3.2 x 3.0 cm The fragments are almost certainly recognized to have been written by the same scribe due to the type of writing ‚Äì a formal script from the late Hasmonaean to the early Herodian period.  4Q254  There are 17 fragments grouped as 4Q254, or Commentary on Genesis C. These fragments are not extensive, but they seem to offer interpretations of blessings and curses. The content of the fragments covers the curse on Canaan, the grandson of Noah from Genesis 9:24-25; the events leading up to the binding of Isaac in Gen. 22:5-7; the blessing of Judah from Gen. 49:8-12; a commentary on the 'two anointed ones' possibly from Zechariah 4:14 or perhaps part of the blessing on Judah in Gen 49:8-12; Jacob's prophecy concerning Issachar and Dan in Gen. 49:15-17; and Jacob's prophecy concerning Joseph from Gen. 49:22-25.  Physical Description  The overall preservation as well as palaeographic and orthographic evidence shows the likelihood that these fragments really do belong together. They were all written in early Herodian formal hand. In fact, all 17 fragments appear to have the same scribal hand. Several of the scribe's letters (their formation consistently throughout all the fragments) suggests a transition from the late Hasmonaean to the early Herodian formal hand. Frg. 1= 2.9 x 3.7 cm Frg. 2=1.0 x 1.7 cm Frg. 3=3.4 x 7.8 cm Frg. 4=4.1 x 6.6 cm Frg. 5=2.1 x 5.1 cm Frg. 6=2.1 x 3.6 cm Frg. 7=2.1 x 2.6 cm Frg. 8=1.9 x 6.2 cm Frg. 9=1.6 x 2.6 cm Frg. 10=2.1 x 1.9 cm Frg. 11=1.2 x 2.8 cm Frg. 12=2.1 x 2.8 cm Frg. 13=1.2 x 2.5 cm Frg. 14=1.0 x 3.5 cm Frg. 15=1.7 x 4.4 cm Frg. 16=5.3 x 5.6 cm Frg. 17=1.3 x 0.7 cm The fragments range from pale tan, to light brown, to a dark brown in color. Several fragments contain damage likely caused by worms, and some seem to preserve traces of ink on the reverse as if those scrolls were wound very tightly in years gone by.  4Q254a  The fourth manuscript in this group, also known as 4QCommentary on Genesis D or pGen IVa, is extant in three fragments in a developed Herodian formal hand. In fragments 1‚Äì2 there is a description of the measurements of Noah's ark, partly citing Genesis 6.15 . Fragment 3 is concerned with Noah's disembarkation and something that the raven makes known to the latter generations.  Physical Description  Fragment 1 is 3.8 cm x 3.2 cm, the left hand edge is very dark brown and can be read with the assistance of infrared photography. The rest of the fragment is tan colour and there is no visible ruling showing''' Fragment 2 is 1.7 cm x 1.4 cm. On this fragment both the left and the right edges are very dark brown the rest being tan. Fragment 3 is two pieces attached together measuring a total of 6.6 cm x 5.0 cm. Its lower right corner and far left edge are dark brown, the rest being tan. An upper margin of 1.9 cm is preserved and ruled guidelines as well as a ruled left margin are visible. Both Fragment 2 and Fragment 3 are attached to paper and on the card in Mus. Inv. 820 and is not movable  Palaeography  The principal reason for distinguishing these three fragments from 4Q254 is the distinctive shape of some of the letters. The features of these letters were developed and more commonly used in the Herodian formal hand. These difference in the formating of the letters show that it was a different scribe who penned these scroll fragments.

It is the debut feature for Merlin Dervisevic, who also directed the film. Starring David Richmond-Peck, Bernadette Saquibal, and Michelle Harrison, the film follows a man wrongly condemned for killing his wife, who finds himself in a mysterious institution where he is sentenced to relive her death for eternity. Distributed by Entertainment One in Canada and Candy Factory Films in the United States, the film was theatrically released on 24 May 2014.  Plot  In their bathroom, Edgar desperately attempts to save his unresponsive wife, Maylon, a Filipino immigrant. Shortly after giving up, he dies, too. Suddenly driving his car down the road, Edgar pulls over in confusion. After he stumbles out of his car, he recognizes a tree without knowing why. He and Maylon argue briefly, then return to their house. Maylon is worried about her troubled teenage son, Gogan, who has not yet returned home. Edgar encourages her to be stricter and dismisses her concerns for Gogan's safety. Gogan briefly returns home but runs away after Edgar threatens to send him back to the Philippines to live with his father; Maylon chases after him. When she returns, Maylon makes Edgar soup. Edgar becomes ill, and Maylon calls an ambulance. When Edgar insists on calling them back himself to report his allergies, she refuses to give him the phone. In the resulting scuffle over the phone, Edgar accidentally kills Maylon, then collapses dead. When Edgar wakes, he is in a large building. A figure on a television set, known as the Councillor, tells him he has murdered his wife and is now also dead. The Councillor orders him to report to group therapy with another televised person, the Facilitator. There, he meets Doris, Julien, and William, among others, all of whom are guilty of killing family members. Confused, Edgar denies he belongs there and says his wife's death was an accident. He is sent back to relive the same day, and, this time, he realises that Maylon has poisoned him. He again objects at group therapy, saying that he is the victim, not Maylon. In a discussion group, Julien says that he murdered his daughter and two boys, William says he murdered his parents, and Doris says she committed suicide. Edgar says that Doris and he do not belong with the others, but she rejects this. As Edgar once again relives his last day, he realises that he intentionally strangled Maylon. Unable to face reliving that day any more, Edgar encourages the others to escape with him. William says he does not want to leave, but Julien agrees to help despite his fear of repercussions. After Doris creates a distraction for them, Edgar and Julien flee to the Councillor's office, where Edgar had previously noticed a hatch leading upward. Julien initially helps him reach the hatch, but then betrays him. Edgar reaches the hatch regardless, and, despite the protestations of the Councillor and Facilitator, enters it. There, he experiences the day from the point of view of Maylon, Gogan, and his brother. Maylon confides in Edgar's brother that she feels trapped and helpless because of Edgar's controlling and possessive behavior, and Gogan is bullied at school. When Gogan runs away, Maylon catches up with him, and they talk about Edgar's plan to send him back to the Philippines. Enraged that Edgar would tell Gogan that she agreed to the plan, she poisons Edgar. Edgar abandons his plan to escape and now desires to change history. He pulls a reluctant Doris into his personal hell, where she assists him in deviating from the events of that day. Together, they secure Maylon in a locked room. Still poisoned, Edgar is horrified when he realises that Maylon will now be a murderer and subject to his fate, as her death at his hands had previously redeemed her. Doris recognises her children outside Edgar's house and becomes entranced with watching them, as her doppelganger prepares to commit suicide nearby from the same tree that Edgar recognised earlier. Edgar rushes to stop her doppelganger from committing suicide, and instead hangs himself in her noose. Reality shifts, and Doris realises that she has escaped the institution. Years later, she leads Maylon and Gogan to her tree, where they engage in a yearly ritual in which they place flowers on Edgar's grave. Back at the institution, Edgar welcomes a new member; the others advise him to avoid Edgar, as Edgar is disturbingly proud of his own suicide.  Cast  Production  Shooting took place in Aldergrove, Coquitlam, and Langley, British Columbia, over fifteen days. The \\"hell\\" institution scenes were shot in the decommissioned Crease Clinic building at Riverview Hospital.  Release  Cruel and Unusual premiered at the Taipei Golden Horse Film Festival, after which it received a distribution deal in Asia. The Canadian premiere was on 24 May 2014 in Vancouver.  Reception  Ken Eisner of The Georgia Straight wrote that it \\"certainly has some clever turns\\" but \\"lacks humour and tonal variety\\". Katherine Monk of The Vancouver Sun rated it 2.5/5 stars and called it a \\"well-executed, if somewhat drab, existential fairy tale\\".

LIPT stands for Leymann Inventory of Psychological Terror.  Structure  The LIPT questionnaire lists 45 mobbing actions at the workplace. A person is regarded as being bullied if one or more of the 45 actions happen at least once per week over a period of at least one year. Alternative mobbing definitions require a shorter period of at least 3‚Äì6 months and the frequent occurrence of more than one action. The effects of the actions on the mobbing victim are divided into five categories: # Effects on self-expression and communication, e.g., the mobbing victim is constantly interrupted, criticized, or yelled at. # Effects on social contacts, e.g., colleagues and coworkers are forbidden to talk with the victim. # Effects on personal reputation, e.g., unfounded rumors about the mobbing victim are circulated. # Effects on occupational situation and quality of life, e.g., the victim is given meaningless jobs or tasks that affect the self-esteem. # Effects on physical health, e.g., threats of physical violence, damage to the workplace, or outright sexual harassment.  Completeness  The 45 mobbing actions are derived by Leymann from 300 individual interviews in the years of 1981 to 1984. After 1984 the interviews did not find further actions and ended.

She is known as the Chinese Disco Queen because of her covers of western disco songs in her early period. She is also noted for being maybe the first Mainland Chinese pop singer in a time when the foreign musical influences were limited, and when the artists from Taiwan and Hong Kong, where the most popular in China.Âº†Ëî∑, Âº†Ëî∑  Biography =First years Zhang was born in 1967, at the beginning of the Cultural Revolution. Her mother was a violin player for the Chinese Philharmonic Orchestra. She started learning to play the violin and piano from the age of 5. Despite her classic musical influences, she was mainly fascinated by pop and disco music, two music styles that at first, where banned in the PRC, although in the 1980s, thanks to the reform and opening, those styles started entering in China. In these years, Taiwanese and Hong Kong singers such as Teresa Teng were prominent, and fascinated the young people.Âº†Ëî∑Âú®‰∫âËÆÆ‰∏≠Â§çÂá∫ 20Âπ¥Âêé‰∏æÂäûÂÖ•Ë°åÁ¨¨‰∏ÄÂú∫ÊºîÂî±‰ºö, Âº†Ëî∑Âú®‰∫âËÆÆ‰∏≠Â§çÂá∫ 20Âπ¥Âêé‰∏æÂäûÂÖ•Ë°åÁ¨¨‰∏ÄÂú∫ÊºîÂî±‰ºö. When Zhang was a student, she usually sang with a portable recorder when she returned from the school, then, she managed to find a South Korean radio station which played also western music. That is how she discovered artists such as The Beatles and Michael Jackson of whom she did not know before, and that would turn into her main influence.Zhang Qiang: China's 'Disco Queen', Zhang Qiang: China's 'Disco Queen'. When she was 18, she left the school and started singing professionally. Although her mother did not like her career choice. She left Beijing and moved temporarily to Guangzhou, where she found a job as a singer in a caf√©. At first, she wanted to stay there, but finally a little record label from Kunming was the first interested in her voice. Yunnan Audiovisual Press, gave a positive response to Zhang's voice recordings and in 1985, she managed to release her debut album. The chief of that little company, said that Zhang had a very strong voice, and that she had an enormous potential. From then on, she would release 20 studio albums in the next two years.  Career  Tokyo Nights, Zhang's first cover album, was released in early 1985. It is calculated that this album sold over a million copies in China. Zhang was initially expected to earn 800 yuan a month. Anyway, due to the high sales of this album, her salary was increased to 1,400 yuan, much more than the salary of her own mother who only got a salary of 70 yuan in her job as a state musician.Âº†Ëî∑Âú®‰∫âËÆÆ‰∏≠Â§çÂá∫ 20Âπ¥Âêé‰∏æÂäûÂÖ•Ë°åÁ¨¨‰∏ÄÂú∫ÊºîÂî±‰ºö, Âº†Ëî∑Âú®‰∫âËÆÆ‰∏≠Â§çÂá∫ 20Âπ¥Âêé‰∏æÂäûÂÖ•Ë°åÁ¨¨‰∏ÄÂú∫ÊºîÂî±‰ºö. Zhang covered many famous songs, she covered a wide range of styles including, Pop, Disco, Techno-Pop, Rock and Chinese traditional music. Anyway, she felt more comfortable performing pop and disco tracks. She preferred cheerful \\"happy\\" songs and urban love songs. That preference could also be seen in the image of the singer, her visual looks were very modern compared to the image sponsored by the communism. Her hair and her colorful clothes were qualified as vulgar by the most conservatives, but considered as fresh by the youth. She followed the trends of the '80s both musically and visually, which helped to make her popular. In the next two- year, Zhang sold more than 20 million copies with her uncountable cover albums. Although, her popularity was widespread, she managed to be famous without the help of marketing. Her face could be seen nowhere in the media, only the covers of her albums featured photos of her, and the only information her fans could find, were nothing else than her releases. It is rumored that despite this enormous disadvantage, Zhang outsold Teresa Teng in 1986. From 1988 to 1992, when she gave birth to her first child, when she was 19, she started releasing only one album per year.  Momentary retirement In 1987, the Mainland Chinese music industry was still underdeveloped. The release of cover albums was the only way available for the Mainland Chinese new singers to perform music. In this year, Zhang started feeling that she could not cover more songs because she already had covered too many. Despite the high amount of money she earned thanks to her albums, Zhang felt tired, and wanting to do something new. She started thinking about composing original songs, but the publishers were not interested in that. Apart from that, in 1987, she went to Australia to study and from 1988 to 1992, she only recorded one album per year. After that, she decided to retire. During that retirement, Zhang, took care of her family and in 1992, she got married in Hong Kong. She stayed in silence from then, to 1996.  Return In 1996 after divorcing, Zhang returned to music. In the middle 1990s, the Mainland Chinese entertainment industry was starting to take off. Singers such as Na Ying, Sun Nan, Sun Yue and Yang Yuying were starting to make a name in the entertainment world and some famous singers such as Faye Wong, had returned to the mainland, working with local producers such as Zhang Yadong. Zhang reappeared with a more mature voice, with a new style and a darker image. Her 1996 album entitled \\"Let's Rock\\" was characterised by a Pop-Rock style and a harder sound compared to her previous works. It was also an important release for her because for first time in her career, all the songs were original. From then on, she started composing her own tracks.Âº†Ëî∑‰∏ìËæë--Â∞ΩÊÉÖÊëáÊëÜ(Ê≠åËØç), Âº†Ëî∑‰∏ìËæë--Â∞ΩÊÉÖÊëáÊëÜ(Ê≠åËØç). In 1997, the singer released \\"Lonely habits\\" another studio album with all the songs written by herself. This album discovered a new creative face of Zhang because for first time, it included sad songs. The most of the traks were down tempo songs very different from what she did before, showing her vocal and creative maturity as a singer. She also included a promotional video for the title track of the album.Âº†Ëî∑‰∏ìËæë--‰π†ÊÉØÂØÇÂØû(Ê≠åËØç), Âº†Ëî∑‰∏ìËæë--‰π†ÊÉØÂØÇÂØû(Ê≠åËØç. After a short period of silence in 2001, Zhang released her 30th album. She was finally recognised as an important part of the Mainland Chinese Mandopop movement. In fact, she was invited, for first time, to perform in the CCTV studios. It was the first time Zhang gave a live performance for TV.Âº†Ëî∑‰∏çÁü•ÈÅìËá™Â∑±ÊòØÊòéÊòü, Âº†Ëî∑‰∏çÁü•ÈÅìËá™Â∑±ÊòØÊòéÊòü.Âº†Ëî∑5ÊúàÂú®‰∫¨Êé®Âá∫ÊúÄÊñ∞‰∏ìËæë„ÄäÂ∞ΩÊÉÖÈ£ûÊâ¨„Äã(ÈôÑÂõæ), Âº†Ëî∑5ÊúàÂú®‰∫¨Êé®Âá∫ÊúÄÊñ∞‰∏ìËæë„ÄäÂ∞ΩÊÉÖÈ£ûÊâ¨„Äã(ÈôÑÂõæ) Creatively, Zhang started experimenting with new styles such as electronic music.

Plot The film opens with DI West (Spall) interviewing Harvey Miller (Treadaway) who had been framed by a gangster called Roper. In flashback we are shown how Harvey, 6 weeks earlier, had been released from prison where he had used information heard in prison to plan his revenge on Roper. Harvey tells how he has planned and executed his revenge using his friends. He reveals details of the failed revenge, a robbery, to West. West reminds Miller of a football match during which a player of a similar description to Miller's, was \\"let down by his team\\". There is insufficient evidence to charge Harvey. West leaves the room, the interview tape recording having been stopped. When he returns and Harvey has left, he finds that Harvey has recorded on the tape the actual details of the robbery during which he successfully took his revenge on Roper. Harvey is relying on West to let him succeed by ignoring the recording and letting leave the country with his friends. Production The Rise was filmed in and around Leeds. There were many contributors to the production of the film.

There is one described species in the genus, Parastemmiulus elektron. The species is one of three millipedes described from Mexican amber, and the oldest Stemmiulidae fossil species as of 2013. History and classification Parastemmiulus elektron was described from a solitary fossil, which is preserved as an inclusion in a transparent chunk of Mexican amber. At the time of description, the amber specimen was housed in the fossil collection of the Instituto Nacional de Antropolog√≠a e Historia in San Crist√≥bal de las Casas, Simojovel. The holotype fossil is composed of a very complete adult female recovered from the La Guadalupe Quarry. Mexican amber is recovered from fossil bearing rocks in the Simojovel region of Chiapas, Mexico. The amber dates from between 23 million years old at the oldest and 15 million years at the youngest. The La Guadalupe Quarry site is an outcrop of amber bearing strata belonging to the Mazantic shale. The deposits preserve a transitional river or stream environments near the coast and preserves fossils of a mangrove forest ecosystem. The holotype was first studied by a team of researchers headed by Francisco Riquelme of the Universidad Aut√≥noma del Estado de Morelos with their 2013 type description of the genus and species being published in the natural sciences journal Historical Biology. The genus name is a combination of the genus Stemmiulus and \\"para\\" meaning along side, a reference to the similarities between the two genera. The specific epithet elektron was is based from the Greek word meaning amber. P. elektron is one of three millipede species described from Mexican amber, the others being Anbarrhacus adamantis and Maatidesmus paachtun, while a number of other species have been described from the similarly aged Dominican amber. One possible Stemmulid fossil was described from Dominican amber, however it was not complete, and has been regarded as doubtful. P. elektron is the first Stemmulid genus described from a fossil. Description The P. elektron female is reddish-brown in overall coloration with the legs a brownish tone that trends to hyaline. The body is composed of forty six segments and has a length of approximately . The ocellar field is shallow and triangular in shape with three ocelli, and is positioned just to the rear of the antennae. Two grooved possible sensory canals are present in the field, one connecting the rear and front ocelli, the other connecting the middle ocelli to the antenna socket. Present is a defined, pear-shaped T√∂m√∂sv√°ry organ located below the antenna socket and reaching the ocellar field. The antennae have a total of eight antennomeres that vary in length. The largest segment is antennomere 2, while the smallest is antennomere 7. The low ocelli numbers, differences in ocelli sizes, and varied antennomere lengths is a combination of characters only found in Stemmiulida. However, in contrast to P. elektron living species of the family do not have a T√∂m√∂sv√°ry organ.

They derived their name from Chamba State. Chambyal is a powerful Kshatriya Hindu Rajput clan in Himachal Pradesh. Chambial clan was under Mushana Dynesty Who rule over Chamba from 6 Century AD. Chambial Suffix Vermans; the clan is from Chamba but it has spread throughout Himachal Pradesh and some parts of Punjab. Location and History Many interesting anecdotes have been recorded about the clan. Chambial, as a royal dynasty and a feudal title in several Indian languages means \\"lord\\" or King; the Chambial were the rulers of Chamba State. The Rajas of Chamba belong to the Kashyap Vansh of the Rajput lineage; the original home of the family is said to have been from North India. These Himachali Rajput clans suffixed their family names after their proper names. Though historical records date the history of the Chamba region to the Kolian tribes in the 2nd century BC, the area was formally ruled by the Maru dynasty, starting with the Raju Maru from around 500 AD, ruling from the ancient capital of Bharmour, located 75 kilometres from the town of Chamba. In 920 AD, Raja Sahil Varman shifted the capital of the kingdom to Chamba, following the specific request of his daughter Champavati. From the time of Raju Maru, 67 Rajas of this dynasty have ruled over Chamba until it merged with the Indian Union in April, although Chamba was under British sovereignty from to then. Raja Maru is said to have been at first a religious devotee whose life was given up to tapas or self-mortification, he afterwards married, three sons were born to him. When they reached manhood he bestowed a kingdom on each of them. Leaving the eldest in the ancestral home, he traversed the Panjab with the other two, settled one of them in the mountains near Kashmir. Accompanied by Jaistambh, the youngest, he penetrated to the Upper Ravi Valley through the outer hills, having conquered that territory from the petty Ranas who held it, he founded the town of Brahmapura and made it the capital of a new State; this event is believed to have taken place about the middle of the sixth century A. D. Bandral was the offshoot of Chambial Rajputs but in course of time they became popular by the name Called Chambial Rajputs. Administration Gopal Singh, Raja of Chamba There have been a total of 67 rajas who have ruled Chamba since the Principality of Bharmour was established in the 6th century, beginning with Raja Maru; these kings belong from ChambialDynasty. Indeed, it is believed to have been an isolated case in the history of India that the Chamba kingdom remained independent without interference for over years. Before Raja Sahila Varman, the territorial extent of the state of Chamba was ill-defined and was more a loosely based territory, marked by disunity. Chamba state was run by Ranas, petty rulers who were allocated locally governed areas known as \\"fiefdoms\\" and treated them as their own independent kingdoms, it wasn't until the reign of Sahila Varman that these Raja lords were subjugated and the district of Chamba was consolidated formally as a unified entity. The rajas of the Chamba Kingdom, ruling from the capital in Chamba divided the kingdom into 5 mandalas termed wazarats. These sub-territories consisted of Chamba, Bhatti and Pangi References Indian family names Rajput clans ","title":"Chambial"},{"id":"48572567","title":"2015‚Äì16 Alabama‚ÄìHuntsville Chargers men's ice hockey season"},{"id":"48572574","text":"Motion Notion is an annual underground electronic dance music and transformational festival located in the Rocky Mountains near Golden, BC, Canada.

He is sometimes called \\"Hugh II\\", although he is the only known Edessene bishop named Hugh. The chronicler Bar Hebraeus calls him \\"Papyas\\" and \\"the metropolitan of the Franks\\".. Most of the Christians in his province would have been Armenians not in communion with Rome; they only recognized papal authority in 1145. Hugh defended his city during the siege of Edessa of 1144 while Count Joscelin II of Edessa was absent. He was killed when the city fell to Zengi, atabeg of Mosul. Hugh was originally from Flanders. On his way to Jerusalem he stopped at the Abbey of Cluny and became an associate of the Cluniac order, being invested by Abbot Hugh with \\"the society of all the goods of the congregation\\", what the Flemish Hugh later called a \\"confraternity of prayer\\" with Cluny... In 1120, he donated some relics‚Äîa finger of Saint Stephen and a tooth of John the Baptist‚Äîto Cluny under Abbot Pons. According to an account of their donation, the Tractatus de Reliquiis Sancti Stephani Cluniacum Delatis, Hugh feared for his soul because he was keeping the holy relics in a city under constant threat of Muslim attack. Only after he was visited three times by the three patron saints of Cluny in visions that he mistook for dreams did Hugh decide to turn the relics over to Cluny. He gave them to Gilduin du Puiset, former prior of Cluny, who gave them to the monk Frotmund, who conveyed them to Cluny in a crystal glass casket.. Hugh also acquired relics of Saints Thaddeus of Edessa and Abgar he sent to the archbishop of Reims, Ralph, in 1123. The letter Hugh addressed to the archbishop has survived, been edited and published. Hugh calls himself Hugo, Dei gratia Edessenae archiepiscopus, that is, archbishop \\"by the grace of God\\".Hugh, \\"Epistola\\" Patrologia Latina, 155, col. 477‚Äì80. Hugh's diocese shrank sometime before 1134, when the Crusaders re-established the ancient Archdiocese of Hierapolis based on the city of D√ºl√ºk, which they called La Tuluppe. Its territory was taken from that of Edessa.. On 28 November 1144, Zengi surrounded the walled city of Edessa while the ruling count was away with his army. In the absence of the ruler and the best fighting men, Archbishop Hugh was charged with the defence of the city. He had the loyal support of the Armenian bishop John and the Syriac bishop Basil. Later chroniclers, including William of Tyre, accused him of refusing to spend from his treasury to pay the arrears of his soldiers, and blame the city's fall on his avarice., vol. II, p. 143. Hugh also ordered the defenders of the citadel not to open the gates unless he arrived in person. After the walls had been breached on 24 December, dozens of citizens were crushed in the mad rush to the citadel as the gates remained shut. Hugh himself was killed either in the stampede or by Zengi's soldiers as he tried to reach the citadel....

Early life Born in 1905 in Sussex, England, Helen Beatrice May Fennell grew up in London. She graduated with a degree in English from the University of London in 1927, and then departed for India where she taught for three years at Mahbubia School, a school for girls in Hyderabad. In about 1930 she left India for South Africa. She settled in Durban where she met and married dentist Billie Joseph. Political Awareness Her service as an information and welfare officer in the Women's Auxiliary Air Force during the Second World War, and her subsequent decision to become a social worker, exposed her to some of the realities of South African life. But Joseph owed her political education to Solly Sachs, serving under him at the Garment Workers Union. In 1953 Joseph was a founder member of the Congress of Democrats, the African National Congress‚Äôs white ally, and in 1954 of the Federation of South African Women. In 1955, she was one of the leaders who read out the clauses of the Freedom Charter at the Congress of the People. She was one of the main organisers of the Women's March of 9 August 1956, one of the most memorable moments of her illustrious political career. The Treason Trial Joseph‚Äôs opposition to the State had not gone unnoticed, and in December 1956 she was one of 156 people arrested and charged with high treason. The trial lasted for four years, from 1956 to 1961. Delivering the verdict on 29 March 1961, Justice Rumpff stated:\\"On all the evidence presented to this court and on our findings of fact, it is impossible for this court to come to the conclusion that the African National Congress has acquired or adopted a policy to overthrow the state by violence, that is, in the sense that the masses had to be prepared or conditioned to commit direct acts of violence against the state.\\" House Arrest In 1962, she became the first South African woman to be placed under house arrest, and was restricted to her home at 35 Fanny Avenue, Norwood, with a security policeman moving in next door. 'I was the first white woman to become subject to the pass laws‚Ä¶At least, my house won't be burgled while I'm at home and the police are watching', Joseph joked in an interview. Bullets pierced her windows and an explosive device was placed in her letterbox. In his submission to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, secret service operative Paul Erasmus stated ‚Äú‚Ä¶that from about 1978 till late in the 1980's he and his colleagues on many occasions damaged the property of Mrs Joseph by throwing stones through the windows of her house‚Ä¶ made telephone threats, fired shots at the house but did not intend to injure any person, ordered and caused unwanted supplies to be delivered at her house, poured paint remover over her motor car as well as a motor car of Ann Hughes when the latter visited her.‚Äù at the Truth and Reconciliation Commission it was also revealed that the apartheid state‚Äôs fear of her was puzzling: ‚ÄúHow a weary old girl, an ou tannie like me can be a threat to state security only they can say.‚Äù Despite her incarceration at home, Joseph regularly looked after the children of comrades, including the daughters of Nelson and Winnie Mandela, and the children of Molly and Bram Fischer. From the late 1970s Christmas Day was ‚ÄúOpen Day‚Äù at Helen Joseph‚Äôs house. Those involved in the ant-apartheid struggle had an open invitation to visit the home. All comrades brought food, and at 12 noon everyone raised their glasses to those on Robben Island (and apparently the Robben Islanders were aware of the ritual). On 25 December 1992 Joseph was in hospital and the venue moved to 11 Plantation Road, The Gardens. Robben Island‚Äôs prisoners had been released, and those present raised their glasses to Helen, who would die shortly thereafter.

It was designed by Hubert George Octavius Thomas and built . It is also known as Bank of North Queensland, Bank of Queensland, and National Bank of Australasia. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Childers branch of the National Bank of Australia, ca. 1948 This single-storeyed timber building, which initially comprised banking chambers at the front of the building and a manager's residence at the rear, was erected as the Childers branch of the Bank of North Queensland, established in Townsville in 1888. The Bank of North Queensland was the only bank ever directed from northern Queensland, and was the first to capitalise on the need for banking facilities in the newly emerging sugar town of Childers. Following logging of the dense Isis Scrub in the 1870s, Childers, in the heart of the scrub, was promoted in the 1880s by Maryborough interests, as an agricultural district. The land in the immediate vicinity of the present town of Childers was surveyed in 1882 into farm blocks. There was no official town survey; Childers developed following the private subdivision of portions 870 and 871, at the railhead of the 1887 Isis railway line from Isis Junction railway station. This was opened on 31 October 1887, and was intended principally to facilitate the transport of timber from the scrub. The coming of the railway not only promoted the development of the town of Childers; it also proved the catalyst for the establishment of a sugar industry in the district in the late 1880s. At the opening of the railway to Childers, Robert Cran, owner of Maryborough's Yengarie mill, announced that he would erect a double crushing juice mill at Doolbi, to supply his mill at Yengarie. This was completed in 1890, with the juice being brought in railway tankers from the Isis. Further expansion of the sugar industry in the Isis was closely related to the activities of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, which erected a central crushing mill in the district 1893-94, and began crushing in 1895. By 1895, at least three other mills had been established in the Isis, with another two under construction, and Childers had emerged as the flourishing centre of a substantial sugar- growing district. Whilst Queensland in general was in a slow recovery mode following the depression of the early 1890s and the 1893 banking crisis, Childers offered attractive advantages to any banking institution contemplating expansion. The Bank of North Queensland was the first to seize the opportunity, and in a notice dated 6 September 1895, published in the Brisbane Courier on the following day, the general manager of the Bank of North Queensland, announced that an agency of the bank was now opened at Childers, for the transaction of all usual banking business. Joseph Harding Forbes is recorded as having entered the service of the Bank of North Queensland on 10 September 1895 as the first manager of the new branch at Childers. It is not known from which premises the bank operated initially, as the Bank of North Queensland did not acquire the present site until August 1899. By this time a branch of the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney had been established in the town, opening in rented premises in 1897. The CBC acquired a permanent site in May 1899, and by March 1900, their new purpose- built banking chambers were approximately 6 weeks from completion. This activity may have induced the Bank of North Queensland to erect new premises in the same year. In August 1900, Brisbane architect HGO Thomas called tenders for the erection of new banking premises at Childers. This is understood to be for the Bank of North Queensland, as the CBC had already erected premises, and the only other bank in the town, the Queensland National Bank, had opened in rented premises in July 1900, and did not erect their own building until 1919. The Bank of North Queensland building at Childers survived the 1902 fire which razed most of the premises on the opposite side of the street. The town was virtually rebuilt at this time. In January 1917, the Bank of North Queensland and the Royal Bank of Queensland, established in Brisbane in 1885 to challenge the colonial dominance of the Queensland National Bank, merged to form the Bank of Queensland, and the premises at Childers were retained as a branch of the new bank. When the Bank of Queensland was absorbed by the National Bank of Australasia in 1922, the Childers building became a branch of the National Bank. By , a verandah had been added along the eastern side and rear of the building, apparently for the use of the manager and his family. In November 1953, the Isis Shire Council approved an application by the National Bank of Australasia Ltd to erect a new bank manager's residence in Childers, and photographic evidence suggests that at this time the living quarters at the back of the building were incorporated into the banking area, the side and rear verandahs were removed, as were the central pediment, finials, and brackets and capitals to the front verandah posts. The new manager's residence, erected at the rear of the bank building, on the block of land facing Crescent Street, does not form part of the heritage listing. Since 1983, the Childers office has functioned as a branch of the National Australia Bank, formed by the amalgamation of the National Bank of Australasia Ltd and the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney Ltd.  Description  The National Australia Bank, a single-storeyed chamferboard building with brick piers and a corrugated iron hipped roof, is located fronting Churchill Street, the main street of Childers, to the south. The building, built parallel to the western boundary, is set back from the street frontage with a lawn area to the east. The building has a symmetrical parapeted facade above a wide street verandah. The parapet consists of timber pilasters and deep timber cornices, with much of the original fanciful timber work including pediment, finials and scrolls having been removed. The verandah has paired timber posts, a panelled frieze with timber mouldings, a timber rail supported by scroll shaped brackets, and wide timber entrance steps. The twin entrance doors with fanlight are framed by timber pilasters, and the paired timber sashes to either side have wide timber surrounds with deep cornices above. The eastern side has undergone a number of changes resulting in a variety of window types, including paired sashes to the front banking chamber and hoppers to the rear. The western side has paired timber sashes with timber batten window hoods. The rear has a masonry chimney to the northwest corner. Internally, the building consists of a banking chamber to the front with a manager's office, store and strongroom behind with a corridor leading to a kitchen area and toilets at the rear. The building has walls of vertically jointed boards, boarded ceilings, and deep timber skirtings and architraves. Doors into the manager's office are without fanlights and have narrower architraves. The masonry strongroom is located on the western side and has a steel door opening to the banking chamber. The rear kitchen area has a timber ceiling rose and fireplace surround. The central section at the rear, housing toilets and passageways, has a slightly lowered floor level and hardboard ceilings. A timber paling fence along the street boundary has an early corner post with turned capital at the eastern end.  Heritage listing  National Australia Bank was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The National Australia Bank building at Childers is important in illustrating the pattern of Queensland history, being erected during a period of unprecedented growth in the Isis, when Childers was emerging as the flourishing centre of a substantial sugar-growing district. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The building has been occupied as banking premises since its construction , and survives as a substantially intact, small, rural, turn-of-the-century timber bank building. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The building, particularly due to its decorative timber street facade, use of scale, form and materials, contributes to the heritage significance of the Churchill Street streetscape and Childers townscape. The composition and treatment of timber details illustrates a quality and competency of design. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The place has a strong association with the work of the Bank of North Queensland, which was the first banking institution to open an agency at Childers, in 1895, and has been associated with the National Bank since 1922.

He was dean of the Toland Medical College during the time that it merged with the University of California system (it was later known as University of California, San Francisco). A surgeon and obstetrician-gynecologist, Cole was among the first to perform some of the newer surgical procedures of his era, such as the Caesarean section and ligation of the common carotid and femoral arteries. Early life Cole was born in Manchester, Virginia, and his family moved to Philadelphia when he was a child. He attended the Delaware Collegiate Institute and he began to study under a Kentucky physician when he was 16. He attended medical school at Transylvania University before transferring to Jefferson Medical College, from which he graduated in 1849. That year, there was a cholera outbreak in Philadelphia, and the 20-year-old Cole was placed in charge of the Pine Street Cholera Hospital. Career In 1852, Cole moved to San Francisco. He had already become a noted obstetrician and surgeon, having performed three Caesarean sections in Philadelphia when that procedure was in its infancy. After the shooting of Cole's friend, San Francisco newspaper editor James King of William, Cole stayed with King and was one of several physicians who tended to his wounds. At one point, a decision was made to insert a sponge into King's chest, and this approach was supported by prominent surgeon Hugh Toland. Cole disagreed with the decision and provided testimony to that effect when the San Francisco Committee of Vigilance called for an investigation into the man's medical care after his death. Cole became a dean of the medical school at the University of the Pacific in 1859. The school closed within two years, and Cole spent most of the American Civil War period in Europe, where he toured hospitals in several countries. When he returned to the US in 1865, most of the former University of the Pacific faculty members were working at Toland Medical College, which had been established by Cole's rival. In 1867, he joined the Outside Lands Committee of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors; the group interested city leaders in the land that became the Golden Gate Park. As Cole gained prominence, the rift between Cole and Toland eased. Cole was named dean of the Toland Medical College in 1870. He served in that capacity for ten years and he remained on the faculty for nearly the rest of his life. Cole assisted in the negotiations when Toland Medical College merged with the state's public university system in 1873. The college became known as the Medical Department of the University of California, then after his death, as the University of California, San Francisco. By 1880, Cole was the first vice president of the AMA. He presided over much of the organization's business that year owing to the illness of president Lewis Sayre. He was a council member of the American Surgical Association in 1882. In 1890, Cole registered his opposition to antiseptic injections in obstetrics before the obstetric committee of the Medical Society of the State of California, reasoning that deliveries had long been accomplished before the introduction of antisepsis. He was an advocate for the practice of inserting alum into the vagina for the treatment of uterine hemorrhage. Personal Cole was married to the former Eugenia Bonaffon. They had five children, three of whom died in infancy. Cole was an active Freemason, earning the degree of Knight Kadosh. Later life In his late sixties, Cole suffered a stroke which left him with partial facial paralysis and changes in his speech. In 1900, he retired as chair of obstetrics and gynecology at the medical school. Upon his retirement, his students and faculty colleagues presented him with an engraved silver plate; an obituary in the San Francisco Call said that he considered the silver plate to be his most special possession. Cole was serving as a coroner when he died of another stroke in 1901.

It is broadly considered to be the artist's masterpiece. Painted in oil on wood, the painting was previously located in the Duomo of Volterra, but has been moved to the town art gallery. Interpretation This painting has often been compared to the fellow Mannerist painter Pontormo's near contemporary (1528) treatment of the same subject in his Deposition canvas in Florence. Unlike Pontormo's bright coloration and unitary collection of billowing figures, the Fiorentino depiction has two arenas: above is an Escher-like geometric struggle of laborers on ladders, removing the crucified Christ, while below, the women and men are subsumed in grief. Mary, pale and downcast, collapses in the arms of two women. Mary Magdalen in bright red, swoons to hug the Madonna's legs. A grief-stricken apostle turns his face away. The somber landscape is virtually barren.Wall Sntreet Journal review of work. One reviewer describes the scene as \\"violent suffering ...rendered by extreme expression, the concatenation of angular bodies, and the dazzling light that sharply draws clear folds on the clothing.\\"Renaissance & Mannerism, by Diane Bodart, page 124. Another states that this is the prototype of early- Mannerism, with \\"no logical spatial connection between the figures, the cross and ladders; the size of the figures appears arbitrarily chosen, and their elongated bodies and small heads\\" distort classical proportions.Masterpieces of Western Art: A History of Art, Part 1, edited by Ingo F.

Built by Rockwell Land Corporation, the developer of Rockwell Center, construction of the flyover began in 1998, originally to facilitate direct northbound traffic flows to Rockwell Center from the Makati Central Business District and the Bonifacio Global City in Taguig via EDSA. Initial plans for managing traffic around the area with the flyover's construction were devised by local construction consultancy SMDI Consultants, while the flyover itself was originally designed by Katahira & Engineers Asia, taking into account the limited land area on which to build it partially due to the construction of the Manila Metro Rail Transit System (MRT). Final plans for the flyover, however, were completed by Ove Arup & Partners, DCCD Engineering Corporation and CJG & Associates. On April 23, 2002, Rockwell Land opened the long, ‚Ç±210 million flyover to traffic, with the inauguration led by Oscar Lopez, chair of the Lopez Group of Companies (the parent company of Rockwell Land), and attended by officials of both companies. Although Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) Secretary Simeon Datumanong, Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) Chairman Benjamin Abalos, and Makati Mayor Jejomar Binay were invited to attend the inauguration, they were instead represented respectively at the event by DPWH Undersecretary Manuel Bonoan, MMDA General Manager Jaime Paz, and Makati Vice Mayor Ernesto Mercado. The Estrella Flyover was originally one-way, but on December 21, 2012, the MMDA opened the flyover to two-way traffic from 7:00 to 10:00 am in order to ease traffic congestion as a result of cars turning right onto EDSA from Estrella Street. Done in coordination with Rockwell Land, the move to two-way traffic was initiated in part because of increased traffic flows to the area as a result of the opening of the Estrella‚ÄìPantaleon Bridge in 2011. However, on September 5, 2016, the MMDA decided to return to one-way traffic.

In the publication, Bach contrasted a work in Italian style ‚Äì a Concerto nach Italienischem Gusto (Concerto after the Italian taste, now known as the Italian Concerto), BWV 971, with a work in French style, a suite which he called Ouvert√ºre nach franzosischer Art (Overture in the French style, also known as the French Overture), BWV 831. History The French Overture had previously been written down in C minor; for the publication of 1735 Bach transposed it to B minor and made slight changes to the musical text, for example in the rhythms of the first movement. The reason for the transposition is not known: one speculation is that the aim was to increase the contrast between the two works. F major is a \\"flat\\" key and B minor is a \\"sharp\\" key, and the keynotes are related by a tritone, which is the most distant modulation. Another possible motivation is that out of the eight German note names A, B (B), C, D, E, F, G, H (B), six had already been used as keynotes in the Partitas, thus only F and H remained.

During the twentieth century, it was one of the largest European textile and industry groups. DMC was the owner and then shareholder of the Ronchamp coal mines. Listed on the Paris stock exchange since 1922, it merged with the Lille company Thiriez and Cartier-Bresson in 1961. After going through a crisis in the 1990s, the old company was liquidated in 2009. In September 2016, the British investment fund BlueGem Capital Partners purchased 100% of the capital of DMC.  History = Eighteenth century  Printing on fabrics was introduced into Mulhouse, France in the middle of the 18th century, allowed the bourgeoisie to manufacture indiennes fabric, which made their fortune. Among the bourgeoisie was the Dollfus family, which was linked to the Koechlin and Engel families. These families included many entrepreneurs, such as Jean- Henri Dollfus. At the end of the 18th century, the Dollfus family set up a factory in the neighboring village of Dornach (today integrated into the city of Mulhouse), along a stream, the Steinbaechlein, which was favorable for the treatment of fabrics. The region of Mulhouse thus plays, after Geneva, a central role in the history of Indian cotton in Europe.  Nineteenth century  DMC mill in the 19th century Daniel Dollfus, a nephew of Jean-Henri Dollfus, was able to take over the company thanks to the contribution of his wife Anne-Marie Mieg. He restructured the company as Dollfus-Mieg et Compagnie, which was officially created on March 21, 1800. The business diversified under the First Empire, with the introduction of weaving and mechanical spinning. These enabled it to control the different phases of fabric manufacturing on the same site. Andr√© Koechlin (who was mayor of Mulhouse twice, from 1830 to 1831 and from 1832 to 1843) took over the management in 1818. An engineer in the Andr√© Koechlin & Cie company, √âmile Koechlin (mayor of Mulhouse from 1848 to 1852), also participated in the business. From its creation, the company was the main client of the Ronchamp coal mines, and in 1812 became its owner. However, in 1843, the widow of Daniel Dollfus had to sell the mines because of poor earnings. Nevertheless, the company remained on the board of directors and remained the main client and shareholder. In 1841, Emile Dollfus (brother of Jean Dollfus, director of DMC, mayor of Mulhouse in 1843 who succeeded his brother-in-law, Andr√© Koechlin, and future initiator of the working class city of Mulhouse) added the manufacture of thread sewing to the activities of DMC, the specialty that has made the reputation of the company. The company also continued printing fabrics and was the first company to use a machine capable of printing 12 colors. Fr√©d√©ric-Engel Dollfus (1818-1883), a follower of Saint-Simon, joined DMC as an associate in 1843. In particular, he developed the production of sewing thread and embroidery cotton, sold worldwide, and mechanized production. In 1870, he took an active part in the economic negotiations which preceded and followed the Treaty of Frankfurt between Prussia and France. He was a member of the Commission for the Defense of Alsatian Interests, and was sent to Tours to the Government of National Defense of 1870. Fr√©d√©ric-Engel Dollfus created for the workers of the company an emergency and retirement fund, group insurance, a nursing home for the elderly, a society to encourage savings, schools and facilities for children (a predecessor of kindergarten). He also created a clinic for sick children in Mulhouse. Finally, he founded the Preventive Accidents Association, in which several manufacturers participated. This association aimed to prevent accidents at work; their inspectors controlled the associated factories. This initiative partially influenced the promulgation of the laws of 1871 (in Germany) and 1874 (in France) relating to the improvement of the working conditions of workers from the point of view of safety and health. Fr√©d√©ric-Engel Dollfus also helped found the drawing school intended to train draughtsmen for the painted canvas industry and the Mulhouse spinning and weaving school (now known as the √âcole Nationale Sup√©rieure d'Ing√©nieurs Sud Alsace). In the 1870s, Fr√©d√©ric-Engel devoted himself more and more to his philanthropic activities, and gave way in the company to his four sons, Fr√©d√©ric, Alfred, Gustave and Eug√®ne Engel. The members of the company were divided regarding their future development: the Dolfuses wanted to focus on producing printed textiles while the Engels emphasized the production of sewing/embroidery thread. In 1877, Jean Dollfus left as a company manager. Fr√©d√©ric-Engel Dollfus and Gustave Dollfus remained. The latter, a nephew of Jean and the son of Emile, is the last of the Dollfus family who remained in the company). In 1888, the Indian factory was liquidated because it had deficits. Meanwhile, Jean Dollfus-Mieg met the Austrian embroidery designer Th√©r√®se de Dillmont during the Universal Exhibition of 1878. He recognized the importance of Th√©r√®se de Dillmont's embroidery creations and the potential it would bring to the company. He managed to persuade her to come and settle in Dornach, where the DMC company is located, in order to found an embroidery school there. It was not until 1884 that Th√©r√®se de Dillmont left the Vienna Embroidery Academy to settle in Mulhouse. It was there that she wrote her famous Encyclopedia of Needlework, the first edition of which dates to 1886.alt=  Twentieth century  Entrance to the Mulhouse factory In 1922, DMC was listed on the Paris stock exchange. During the German occupation of France in the Second World War, the company worked for the Nazis in war production. In 1961, it merged with the Lille company Thiriez and Cartier-Bresson. The Mulhouse company kept its corporate name but replaced its logo, a bell, with that of Thiriez, a horse's head. In the 1960s, the company had up to 30,000 employees. DMC also diversified into weaving (fabrics in Remiremont and Bruay in Artois, dyed woven fabrics in Roanne, terry cloth in Albert), in fabric printing (Texunion in Pfastatt and KBC in L√∂rrach), and in household linen (Descamps in Lille).The group also had a factory for zippers (Winged Closure with Airaines ) and has been engaged in publishing (√âditions DMC specializing in books on sewing and embroidery works and √âditions Mame in Tours). It is to the DMC editions that we owe the Encyclopedia of Needlework by Th√©r√®se de Dillmont, an essential reference work for all needlework. DMC suffered oil-related shocks and Asian competition as a part of the European textile crisis. In 1990, the workforce had been halved to 15,000 employees. Printed textiles were also going out of fashion. The group tried to diversify by launching approximately twenty Loisirs et Cr√©ation stores offering embroidery and interior decoration items. The decline continued and from 10,000 employees in 1998, it had only about 1,100 ten years later. Boxes of DMC cotton  Twenty-first century  Led by Jacques Boubal and his right-hand man Dominique Poile, the restructuring continued. By 2008, the company had only around 800 people. In addition to the stores, the group only kept the manufacture of velvet (SAIC Velcorex) and embroidery thread (DMC). The accumulation of the group's strategic errors led to a bitter failure with liabilities of around 100 million euros, culminating in its cessation of payments in May 2008. The consulting company Bernard Krief Consulting (led by Louis Petiet and now Krief Group) took over, as part of a disposal plan, the velvet activity of SAIC Velcorex in August 2008 (which was liquidated in March 2010) and the embroidery thread activity in December 2008. Bernard Krief Consulting appointed, as president of the new DMC SAS, the former manager Dominique Poile to whom he sold capital in 2009, in violation of the law. On February 18, 2009, the judicial liquidation of the old company was pronounced by the Paris Commercial Court. DMC shares were withdrawn from Euronext listing. In 2011, the plan to sell the embroidery thread activity was challenged by the filing of a complaint for fraud in the December 2008 judgment. In June 2016, the British investment fund BlueGem Capital Partners announced its intention to buy 100% of the capital of DMC. The repurchase was made in September 2016. In February 2019 the DMC company was acquired by the British investment fund Lion Capital.

The church's history goes back to its initial construction in 1940 and is French and Vietnamese style of architecture. It is part of the Roman Catholic Diocese of ƒê√† L·∫°t and contains a nunnery which operates schooling for local children. History The construction of the complex started in 1940. The cathedral in the Domaine holds the remains of Suzanne Humbert, wife of Jean Decoux (Governor-General of French Indochina from July 1940 to 9 March 1945), who died in a traffic accident in 1944. Her tomb is located immediately behind the church lobby, situated in a spacious site with many flowers. Architecture Church interior The church is located atop a hill in Da Lat. It is built in a style reminiscent of 17th Century French architecture. The walls are made of pink limestome. The church features stained-glass windows and a large 3m of statue of the Virgin Mary standing upon a globe of the world. The statue resembles a Vietnamese woman and was designed by French architect Jonch√®re in 1943. It was donated by Mrs. Decoux. Nicknamed the \\"Cherry Church\\" by locals, it is described as a fusion of French and Vietnamese architecture. The French influence can be seen in the walls that allow a \\"creative manipulation of lights\\" with the various roofs of the complex designed in the style of the Nha Rong, a type of stilt house typical of the Central Highlands area of Vietnam. The church's fa√ßade is designed as an isosceles triangle and is noted for the number of small arch-shaped windows. A cross is located on top of the main triangular portion of the building.

The Daughters have been present in French Indo-China since 1940; two were sent to Dalat in 1941 to scout out an area to establish a convent. Having cleared the area on the top of the hill, 30 nuns arrived at the end of October 1941 from various locations around the French Indochinese colonies. When the church was inaugurated in November 1942 it had 60 nuns and a priest. Over the years the convent would accept Vietnamese girls who wished to join their order. They would also run an orphanage at the Church; as of 2007 the church operates a kindergarten with 300 children. The revenue from this operation helps keep the Domaine open. The complex is part of the Roman Catholic Diocese of ƒê√† L·∫°t.

She is currently a Professor of Religion at Boston University. She previously held a position at Brandeis University's Feminist Sexual Ethics Project, and was a research associate and postdoctoral fellow at Brandeis University (2001‚Äì2003) and Harvard Divinity School.  Education  Ali received her BA at Stanford University in History and Feminist Studies in 1993. Then, in 2000, she received her M.A. in Religion and in 2002 her Ph.D. in Religion both at Duke University. She converted to Islam while in college.  Work  Ali has written a considerable amount relating to the topic of marriage, womanhood, and their connection with, and development alongside, Islam. Her major works include Sexual Ethics and Islam: Feminist Reflections on Qur'an, Hadith, and Jurisprudence, Marriage and Slavery in Early Islam, Imam Shafi‚Äòi: Scholar and Saint, The Lives of Muhammad, and most recently Human in Death: Morality and Mortality in J.D. Robb's Novels. Ali has also co-authored two books, including Women in Latin America and the Caribbean and Islam: The Key Concepts. As a scholar, she is sensitive to the way the Western World perceives women in Islam and says that in Islamic studies \\"Issues of gender are very much on everybody's minds.\\" Sexual Ethics and Islam: Feminist Reflections on Qur'an, Hadith, and Jurisprudence was called a \\"challenging contribution\\" to Islamic history by Comparative Islamic Studies. The first edition of this book was concerned with \\"intra-Muslim debates and discussions,\\" focusing more on the \\"theoretical and sexual\\" than on lived experience. Ali talks about controversial topics such as marriage, divorce, sex, concubinage, same-sex intimacy, and much more. In these chapters, she uses references to summarize different point of views in order to expand on each topic in which she covers. This allows for an idea of not only her opinion and the opinion of others within the Muslim community and outside of the Muslim community. Ali has since published her anniversary addition. In the 2016 edition, Ali chose not to rewrite chapters, but she allows the original work to stand. Each chapter is supplemented with a Coda to further expand on topics previously addressed. The Coda focus on new publications that are selective rather than expansive. The Codas also tend to focus on recent updates in the subject in which she is covering. They also tend to correct previous comments or opinions with more modern thoughts. This edition still speaks relatively little of lived experience, but includes more reflections from Muslim women and gestures toward work yet to be done. Marriage and Slavery in Early Islam was called a \\"meticulous, pellucid, authoritative and very focused survey of early Islamic marriage law\\" by the Journal of the American Academy of Religion. The Journal of Law & Religion calls Marriage and Slavery a \\"valuable contribution to the fields of legal, historical and gender studies.\\" The Lives of Muhammad was reviewed favorably by Publishers Weekly.

Both vessels were well known in their day and had reputations for speed, power, and efficiency.The first Harvest Queen, widely considered one of the finest steamers of its day, was constructed at Celilo, Oregon, which was then separated from the other portions of the navigable Columbia River by two stretches of difficult to pass rapids. At considerable risk, this steamer was taken down through the first set of rapids in 1881, and the second set in 1890. Thereafter the first Harvest Queen was worked primarily between Astoria and Portland, Oregon until 1900, when it was dismantled. Most of the machinery was installed in a new, slightly smaller vessel, also called the Harvest Queen, which, although it had accommodations for passengers, was primarily worked as a towboat. In 1926 the second Harvest Queen was sold to a scrap metal concern, Alaska Junk Company (later to become Schnitzer Steel Industries), which sought a buyer for the steamer. With no buyer found, the boat was stripped out and then abandoned near Ross Island.  Construction Harvest Queen was built in 1878 at Celilo, Oregon for the Oregon Steam Navigation Company. The name was suggested by one T.B. Merry, \\"because she was the queen of the harvest, and the farmers' salvation.\\" This vessel was sometimes referred to as the Queen. On August 1, 1878, it was reported that the Harvest Queen was undergoing finishing work at Celilo, and was expected to be ready to begin running between Celilo and Wallula, Washington by the first of September. Harvest Queen cost $24,000 to build. Dimensions and engineering  Harvest Queen, on right, at Almota, W.T. on the Snake River. Steamer Almota is on left. Photograph taken by Capt. James W. Troup. As built, Harvest Queen was feet long, exclusive of the fantail, which was the overhang at the stern of the boat on which the sternwheel was mounted. Harvest Queen had a beam (width) of feet, which was exclusive of the guards, the wide wooden protective timbers running along the top of the hull. Counting the fantail and the guards, Harvest Queen was feet long, with a beam of feet. The depth of hold was feet. Depending on the load, the steamer's draft ranged from to feet. The vessel could carry nearly 500 tons of cargo. Overall size of the vessel was 845.80 gross and 697.04 registered tons. The official merchant vessel registry number was 95534. Harvest Queen was driven by twin horizontally-mounted single cylinder steam engines, each turning an arm, called a pitman, connected to the stern-wheel. Each engine had a bore of and a piston stroke of . Operations 1878-1900 In 1878, the navigable portion of the Columbia river was divided into the \\"lower river\\", running from the river mouth, near Astoria, to the Cascades Rapids. This was also called the Cascades route. The stretch between the head of the Cascades rapids and the foot of Celilo Falls was called the \\"middle river\\", the \\"middle Columbia\\" or the \\"Dalles route\\". The Columbia above Celilo Falls was called the \\"upper river\\" or the \\"upper Columbia\\". Harvest Queen was built to work on the upper river, in conjunction with steamers working on the middle and the lower rivers. The Queen was then the largest steamer operating on the upper river. James W. Troup was the first captain of the vessel. Navigation on the upper Columbia was seasonal in nature, usually beginning about the middle of March and ending at the beginning of December. Dense fogs and low water in early December 1879 forced the withdrawal of the larger upper river steamers, Harvest Queen, D.S. Baker, and Annie Faxon, from service and even the smaller vessels were having difficulty navigating on the river. In 1879, the extremely successful Oregon Steam Navigation company was dissolved, and all its steamers, including Harvest Queen, fell under the ownership of a new corporation, the Oregon Railway and Navigation Company. In April 1879, the Snake River was rising rapidly, at the rate of two feet a day. Because of the increased water depth, and the increased freight on the Snake River, the decision was made to take Harvest Queen up the Snake River to Lewiston, Idaho. Upon reaching Lewiston, Harvest Queen would be the largest steamer, by 35 feet,ever to reach that city. William P. Gray (b.1845) was captain of the Harvest Queen in June 1879. On Monday, August 25, 1879, Harvest Queen arrived at Celilo with 437 tons of wheat, which at that time was the largest load ever carried on the upper Columbia. In early October 1880, President Rutherford B. Hayes was touring the west. After visiting Walla Walla, President Hayes and his party rode a train west to the Columbia river, where they boarded the . At Wallula, the president boarded the Harvest Queen, which proceeded west downriver to Celilo. Rail construction was advancing along the south bank of the upper Columbia eastward from The Dalles, towards Wallula, W.T., at the confluence of the Columbia and Walla Walla rivers. By December 1880, the rail line had reached Blalock Landing, thirty miles upriver from Celilo. Harvest Queen ran between Wallula and Blalock Landing. In December 1880, a moored steamboat, the NorthwestNorthwest had been built in 1877 at Columbus, W.T., (now known as Maryhill) and was 124 feet long, 24-feet beam, 4.5 depth of hold, and 356 tons. was in use as the railroad waiting room at Blalock Station. Once the rail line reached Wallula, there would be little work remaining for Harvest Queen on the upper river. Transfer to middle Columbia In 1881, Harvest Queen was transferred to the middle Columbia River. This required the steamer to be run through Celilo Falls. Under the command of James W. Troup, one of the best-regarded steamboat captains of the day, on February 8, 1881, Harvest Queen went through the first stretch of whitewater, called Tumwater Rapids, sustaining serious damage in the process. The boat was beached and temporary repairs were made, and the boat was returned to the river. At least two more falls lay between the steamer and The Dalles These were Five Mile and Ten Mile Rapids. Harvest Queen was able to pass both these rapids with only minor damage. The steamer reached The Dalles, the principal city on the middle Columbia, on February 18, 1881. From 1881 to 1890, Harvest Queen was operated on the middle river, under the command of Capt. John McNulty. Transfer to lower Columbia On Sunday, May 18, 1890, under command of Captain Troup, Harvest Queen was run through the Cascades to the lower river, witnessed by the largest crowd ever assembled for such an event. Four hundred people came down from The Dalles on the steamer D.S. Baker. One thousand people boarded the \\"R.R. Thompson at Portland, with eight hundred more embarking on the T.J. Potter. Bands aboard the steamers entertained the passengers. Ione also transported excursionists. In addition, three passenger trains departed the Union Pacific depot in Portland, bound for the Cascades. About 8,000 tickets were sold for passage on the trains. Another train came in from Arlington, Oregon. Once all the passengers had arrived on the steamers, they were transported from the lower Cascades five miles on the narrow gauge portage railway, or, in the case of the R.R. Thompson's passengers, on the regular line, to the upper Cascades, where the rapids began. The first four miles of the Cascades were covered in just four minutes. There were twenty passengers on board during the run, including prominent steamboat personnel of the day. This was the fourth time that Captain Troup had brought a steamer down through the rapids. It was the ninth time that a steamer had been brought through the Cascades rapids. No further runs through the Cascades would be made until three years later, in 1893, when Captain Baughman took D.S. Baker from the middle to the lower river. By this time, the Union Pacific railroad had acquired control of the Oregon Railway and Navigation Company. On April 1, 1890, the Union Pacific reorganized its riverine service, and appointed Captain Troup as superintendent. Harvest Queen was extensively repaired in 1890. In March 1892 there were rumors of an impending rate war on the Portland-Astoria run among the Union Pacific, owners of the Harvest Queen, the then-new and speedy steamer T.J. Potter, and the pioneer steamboat men Jacob Kamm, owner of Lurline, and U.B. Scott, owner of the very fast stern-wheeler Telephone. Readiness against Coxey's Army In April 1894, Harvest Queen embarked 300 troops from the barracks of Vancouver Barracks to be transported to Kalama in case of trouble caused by \\"Commonwealers\\" at Puyallup, Washington. A Northern Pacific special train was waiting at Kalama to transport the troops to Puyallup. The Commonwealers were a branch of Coxey's Army, an organization of laborers that arose in the context of the widespread unemployment following the Panic of 1893. The general plan of the Commonwealers, and similar groups around the country, was to travel to Washington, D.C. to protest, seeking government funding of projects that would produce jobs for the unemployed. Trouble had come in various cities as the Commonwealers boarded trains without paying fares. A large rally of the Commonwealers took place in Puyallup, Washington near the end of April, 1894. No transport of troops from Vancouver Barracks was ordered however, and at 4:00 p.m. on May 2, 1894, Harvest Queen was discharged from War Department service, and returned to Portland. Rescue of snow-bound train passengers In early January, 1895, an O.R.& N. passenger train became stranded by snow drifts in the Columbia Gorge. On the morning of January 5, 1895, Harvest Queen was dispatched to proceed upriver through floating ice and bring out the passengers. Intervention in fishermen's strike In 1896, Harvest Queen was chartered by the Oregon National Guard to transport troops to Astoria to intervene in a fishermen's strike. On Tuesday, June 15, 1896, an officer of the Oregon adjutant-general's office, Major Geo. T. Willett placed a telephone call to Col. Owen Summers, at the Multnomah County Armory. Willett informed Summers that an order would soon be issued to require Summers to assemble his troops and be ready for instant movement. Later orders to Summers were that Harvest Queen had been chartered by the Oregon Military Department and that he should embark the troops under his command onto the steamer to proceed to Astoria, and to cooperate there with county judge J.H.D. Gray in suppression of the fishermen's strike then in progress. The troops were assembled by 11:30 p.m. on June 15, and were ready to embark on Harvest Queen early the next morning, at 2:30 a.m. The troops marched in a column to the dock where the Harvest Queen lay, and boarded the vessel. Freight and equipment, including Gatling guns and field artillery, was also loaded on board, and at 4:00 a.m. on June 16, Harvest Queen pulled out from the dock. Col. Summers ordered the troops to behave in a military fashion and to remain inside the cabin of the vessel so that there would not be a visible military presence on the decks of the steamer. Sentries were posted to insure this remained so. Harvest Queen with the troops on board arrived at the O.R.& N.'s dock in Astoria at 10:30 a.m. on June 16, 1896. An encampment was set up in the courthouse square. Troops were detailed to serve as cannery guards, and a Gatling gun was set up on a tugboat to serve as a harbor patrol vessel. No disturbance was noted. On June 21, 1896, Colonel Summers was ordered to return to Portland with his command, but leave behind in Astoria about 100 troops, with the Gatling guns. The troops returned to Portland on board Harvest Queen. Opening of Cascades Locks and Dam Maria, Dalles City, Harvest Queen, and Sarah Dixon Harvest Queen was present at the formal opening of the Cascade Locks and Canal on the afternoon of November 5, 1896. Sinkings and other incidents=Overcrowding In June 1890, Warren V. Sackett, captain of the Yaquina Bay steamer Walluski, filed a complaint with the U.S. steamboat inspection office in Portland, alleging that Harvest Queen, and another steamer, S.G. Reed had carried passengers in excess of licensed capacity. Against Harvest Queen, Sackett charged that the steamer departed Portland for Astoria on June 8, carrying 613 passengers, when the boat's license allowed for only 400. Against S.G. Reed, Sackett claimed that the steamer had run from Portland to Oregon City, also on June 8, carrying 561 passengers, and returned with 760, when the Reed's license allowed only 500. The practice of carrying passengers in excess of the licensed limit was criticized in the Daily Morning Astorian. In addition to fines of $1,000 against the ship owners for each offense, Sackett and any other person filing such allegations stood to earn one-half of the fine imposed by the government, as well as $10 per head and passage money for every passenger carried in excess of the license limit. A fine was imposed. The O.R.&N.; applied to the federal district court in Portland, Oregon, to remit the fine. In March, U.S. District Judge Matthew Deady made his findings, which were to have been forwarded to the secretary of the treasury. The case against S.G. Reed was dismissed. Groundings and sinking At 3:00 in the morning of Saturday, January 23, 1892, Harvest Queen ran aground at Warrior Reef, on the Columbia River near St. Helens. The grounding occurred near Warrior Rock lighthouse on Sauvie Island. The fog was so thick that the light could not be seen. At about 6:00 a.m. the small propeller steamer City of AstoriaThe City of Astoria was built in 1889 and was 72 feet long and rated at 56.47 gross tons. came along, and Harvest Queen signaled to the passing boat. Thirty-five passengers, and, reportedly, the steamer's freight, were transferred to the City of Astoria and brought to Portland. Sometime later, either about noon or 8:00 p.m. the steamer was refloated, sustaining no harm except for some minor damage to the stern-wheel. In June 1894, the Union Pacific tried to send the Harvest Queen back up through the Cascades rapids to work again on the Middle Columbia. The attempt was near success, but near the top of the rapids, Harvest Queen struck a rock, and began to fill with water. On November 19, 1895, after departing Astoria bound for Portland, Oregon, she ran into a submerged piling at a fish trap near Oak Point, 60 miles downriver from Portland in heavy fog. The steamer sank and was thought to be a total loss. Later however the vessel was raised and taken to Portland, Oregon for repairs, operated until 1899, when it was deconstructed with much of its machinery going to a new steamer of the same name. Excessive speed In 1895 the city of Portland had an ordinance which restricted the speed of steamboats to 6 miles per hour in front of the city. The ordinance was widely ignored, but eventually the harbormaster McInnis decide to enforce it. He caused Captain Gray, of the Lurline, and Captain Martineau,of Harvest Queen, to be arrested and charged with violating the speed ordinance as a test case. Drownings Reward placed June 18, 1890, for recovery of the body of crewman George P. Ward, drowned crewman of Harvest Queen. Crewmen on board steamboats in the 1890s did not wear life-preservers. Drownings often occurred if they fell into the river. In late May, 1890, while Harvest Queen was coming upriver from Astoria to Portland, George P. Ward, of Portland, a watchman, was drowned when he was struck with a gang plank as the boat was preparing for a landing and knocked into the river. According to a later, more detailed account, at about midnight, Ward, who had recently acquired a mate's license, slipped on the deck while preparing to receive a load of several cords of wood from a landing as fuel for the steamer, which was then moving at full speed. Ward fell, struck his head on the guard and rolled off the boat, possibly in a state of unconsciousness. Captain Emken, in command at the time, was immediately notified, and the steamer was stopped and a boat sent out to look for Ward. The steamer and the boat cruised around for two hours looking for him, proceeding two miles downriver, but they found nothing. Efforts to recover Ward's body were unsuccessful. The Queen arrived in Portland with the flag at half-staff on account of the death. Ward's brothers, of Portland, offered a $50 reward for recovery of his body. On the night of Wednesday, February 17, 1897, another crewman, Archibald A. Roof fell off Harvest Queen, and was presumed drowned. The steamer was towing the barkentine Northwest, and nearing the confluence of the Willamette and the Columbia rivers when Roof was last seen. Shortly after that, Roof was missed, and it was supposed he had fallen off the boat and was drowned. There were no witnesses however. The rebuilt Harvest Queen The second Harvest Queen at Astoria, Oregon, circa 1906, towing an ocean-going ship. In 1900, by a Danish immigrant shipbuilder, Peter Carstens (1842-1914), built a new vessel, also called Harvest Queen, at Portland for the Oregon Railway & Navigation Company. Much of the machinery and many of the fittings from the old vessel were used on the new steamer. The steam engines were of the poppet valve type, with 24 inch cylinders and an 8-foot piston stroke. The upper works seem to have been transferred to the new steamer also, which was reported to have more staterooms than usually found on towboats. The rebuilt vessel was 187.0 feet long, exclusive of the fantail, with a beam of 39.8 feet, exclusive of the guards. The depth of hold was 9.0 feet. Overall size was 733 gross and 430 registered tons. The official merchant registry number was 96489. Total number of crew required was listed as 12. The machinery was built in Portland by the firm of Wolff & Zwicker. Operations after 1900 The second Harvest Queen was launched at 11:00 a.m. on May 1, 1900 at the company's shipyard in North Portland. Harvest Queen was taken out on a trial trip on the Willamette River on the afternoon of Thursday, August 2, 1900. The boilers were set to produce only 120 pounds of steam, rather than the 180 pounds to be carried in service. The stern-wheel was also revolved more slowly, at 21 revolutions per minute rather than the 30 turns a minute when the boat was under full speed. Still the boat made a six mile run downstream to St. Johns in 19 minutes. The rebuilt steamer was scheduled to make its first passenger trip on Sunday, August 5, 1900, carrying the Oregon Camera Club, departing from the Ash Street dock at 8:30 a.m. The commander of Harvest Queen would be Capt. Lester A. Bailey, and the chief engineer would be Fred Smith. Pacific County, WA. In October 1910, it was reported that Harvest Queen would undergo some reconstruction work, with new staterooms being added. Work on the top level of cabins, called the texas, would also be done. There was little towing work for Harvest Queen any more, as the Union Pacific had turned over that business to the Port of Portland. In August 1911, Harvest Queen was running together with T.J. Potter and Hassalo from Portland to Megler, Washington. Harvest Queen departed the Ash street dock in Portland at 8:00 p.m. every weekday (10:00 p.m. on Saturdays) for the beach, stopping at Astoria on the trip downriver. There was no service on Sundays. On September 5, 1912, the Howell Shingle Mill, the largest business in Cathlamet, Washington, caught fire in the drying kilns at about 3:30 p.m. The steamers Julia B. and Monarch were on the scene and ran firehoses out to fight the fire. Later the Harvest Queen arrived,and all the boats remained until 2:00 a.m., when the fire was brought under control. Although the mill itself was saved, the dry kiln and 13 carloads of shingles were destroyed, for a total loss of about $20,000. For some time, in addition to the mill, the Skamokawa dock, store, note and several nearby residences were also in danger. In February 1913, Harvest Queen was taken out of service for an overhaul and some reconstruction work. The steamer had run over 178,000 miles since its last major overhaul. A new and lower smokestack, as well as lower king posts and hog posts were installed, so that the steamer could pass under a newly build railroad bridge with the water at the 20-foot stage. The top of the stack would now be 57 feet above the water level. The work was done at the Port of Portland dry dock. In March 1914, plans were announced to install wireless radio communication on Harvest Queen, which would be the first steamer on the river to be fitted with radio apparatus. On February 18, 1921, Harvest Queen departed Portland at 8:00 P.M. for Astoria for the last time. When Harvest Queen departed Astoria the next day, returning to Portland, all steamboat service of the O-W R & N on the Portland-Astoria route ended permanently. The Harkins line would handle the O.W. R & N's business on the Astoria run. In June, 1921 it was announced that Harvest Queen would be employed as a ferry running across the Columbia between Astoria and Megler, meeting a Harkins steamer, the propeller Georgiana. With the summer rush over, in September 1921, Harvest Queen was withdrawn from the Astoria-Megler ferry service, and taken to Portland, where it was tied up to a dock next to Hassalo and T.J. Potter. Harvest Queen was also operated as a ferry on the Astoria- Megler route during the summer of 1923 as a replacement for the propeller- driven steamboat Nahcotta, which was then undergoing repair. Disposition Hassalo, published in The Sunday Oregon, July 4, 1926. On June 30, 1926, the Oregon-Washington Railway and Navigation Company, the legal successor to the O.R.&N;, sold Harvest Queen and Hassalo to the Alaska Junk Company. The retirement of these two vessels from the once large O-W R.&.N. fleet left only two steamers remaining, the small propeller Nahcotta, then running as a ferry between Astoria and Megler, Washington, and the then new sternwheeler Lewiston, built in 1923 and operating on the Snake River. At the time of the sale, both Harvest Queen and Hassalo were moored in the Willamette River at Albina. On June 30, 1926, the date of the sale, both vessels were moved to south Portland and tied up at a dock built for ships during the First World War by the Northwest Steel company. Harvest Queen and Hassalo had been out of service since at least February 1, 1925, tied up next to the old T.J. Potter, all of them once considered some of the fastest and most prestigious vessels on the river. On July 4, 1926, the Alaska Junk Company, owned by Sam Schnitzer (1880-1952) and H.J. Wolf, offered Harvest Queen and Hassalo, a similar vessel, for sale. Abandoned in the Willamette River, in the first part of 1927 Harvest Queen sank near Ross Island. A few months later, in early June 1927, the steamer's pilot house broke free during rising storm waters and floated downriver, causing a mistaken report of a sunken vessel to be filed with the harbor patrol. Plans and model Plans of the hull lines of the Harvest Queen are in the collection of the Oregon Historical Society. A model of the Harvest Queen is at the Columbia Gorge Discovery center in The Dalles, Oregon.

It has been interpreted as an Elmenteitan Pastoral Neolithic settlement. The excavation of this site produced pottery sherds, stone tools with obsidian fragments and obsidian blades, along with large amounts of animal bones.  Location  Ngamuriak is located in what is now south-western Kenya, 3 kilometers east of the Lemek village. The site sits on a large and open plain that is covered in vegetation such as dwarf shrubs and grass. The area wildlife includes wildebeest, giraffes, gazelle, zebras, impalas, and warthogs.  Excavation  Three seasons of excavation occurred at Ngamuriak, from July to October in 1981, November to December in 1984, and in April to May of the following year in 1985. The excavation itself was conducted using a grid system for the mapping, while trenches were dug in various sizes ranging from 2m x2m to almost 60 square meters. The first series of excavations were done with 2m x 2m trenches that formed a grid pattern, which allowed for more extensive trenches with exploited features and the retrieval of more artifacts and faunal remains. Excavations conducted during the 1981 research produced a large amount of faunal remains, artifacts, and charcoal samples. During the 1984 excavation, similar forms of stratigraphy was used and resulted in more faunal remains and artifacts being discovered along with both charcoal and bone fragments. Excavation in 1985 yielded similar findings, along with dung deposits being found around the south-western region of Ngamuriak. When the south-western area of Ngamuriak was excavated in 1981 a hardened clay surface was uncovered, which was used as a floor for a structure. Evidence for this is supported by the post holes that are found along the floor, which indicates that a hut was constructed at this location. Numerous animal dung deposits were also uncovered in the area of the site.  Artifacts  The artifacts that are excavated from Ngamuriak vary from stone tools which contained obsidian blades or fragments, pottery sherds, and numerous faunal and charcoal remains. Of the 62,000 faunal specimens that were studied only 4,656 were fully identified. A large amount of the identifiable bones came from domesticated animals, with 2,228 being identified as cattle and 2,404 belonging to sheep and goats. The cattle from the site have been identified as Bos indicus (zebu) or Bos indicus/Bos taurus crossbreeds.  Stone tools  A sample of 93 artifacts were obtained from a single area of a midden at Ngamuriak. These samples contained formal tools as well as secondarily modified pieces, cores/core fragments, along with flakes and fragments. Using XRF analysis on the obsidian artifacts show where one of the sources of the obsidian was collected from, with deposits coming from the central Rift Valley near Mt. Eburru.  Pottery  The stone artifacts and pottery sherds appear to be influenced by the Elmenteitan industry, a Pastoral Neolithic culture in East Africa. The pottery was being described as ‚ÄúRemnant Ware‚Äù or Elmenteitan based on the decorative style and shapes of the pottery. Elmenteitan pottery typology consists of two different types of hemispherical bowls with rims. The base could be conical. There can be stylistic variation regarding the location of spouts and lugs on these vessels. The location and form of some Remnant ware found at Ngamuriak could indicate that some spouts and lugs were not used for pouting, but were used to help suspension. Decoration could include punch holes, notching, incisions, and impressions. The use of Elementeitan could be traced back to over two thousand years ago. This type of ware is found in the central part of the Kenyan Rift Valley and contained in the areas of Mt. Eburru, Lake Nakuru, Gogo Falls, and Ngamuriak.  Livestock  In later Pastoral Neolithic sites, faunal remains from domestic species are usually abundant. Out of the 4,565 identified remains found, only 22 were identified as belonging to the wildlife that inhabited that area surrounding Ngamuriak. This reflects on how the inhabitants of Ngamuriak relied heavily on domestic animals for subsistence. This could represent a deliberate concentration on the exploitation on domestic herds, with very minimal hunting of wild animals for food. This strategy of food procurement is similar to the present Maasai pastoralists. Evidence based on the caprine remains shows goats were culled at an early age. The high level of bone fragmentation found at the site suggest the inhabitants consumed nutrients within the animal bones and the animals were in good condition when they were slaughtered. The diet itself focuses mostly on high protein and low carbohydrate intakes, with livestock being the primary source of fat and protein and cultivation providing the low sources of carbohydrates. The patterns in which the animals were killed indicate how the pastoralists at Ngamuriak managed their livestock. While cattle and caprine (sheep and goats) have different gains in weight, with cattle having a rapid rate in weight gain and caprine having a slower weight gain rate, both were commonly consumed when the animals reached their maximum weight.  Dating  Radiocarbon dating indicates that the site was occupied at some point in time between the years of BC 198 to AD 59. Although the dating of the obsidian artifacts was not consistent with the charcoal samples, it allows speculations that the area of Ngamuriak was occupied at various times.

Protestant reformer Martin Luther, who emphasized that salvation is attained through faith alone, argued for infant faith using the example of John the Baptist leaping in Elizabeth's womb during the visitation of the pregnant Mary. John Calvin also believed infants were capable of exercising faith, and used this as an argument in favor of infant baptism, though it was not considered essential to his defense of the practice.
