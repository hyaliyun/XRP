It was written by Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa and Caitlin Parrish, and directed by Kevin Tancharoen. The episode centers on Kara and Alex dealing with an emotional Thanksgiving while a DJ seeks revenge on Cat following an accident. Plot At the DEO, Hank gives Kara the rest of the day off after she subdues an alien. At Alex's apartment, Kara worries that their mother, Eliza, will be upset that she has come out as Supergirl. Eliza arrives and is happy to see Kara, but is overly critical of Alex. After delivering a diatribe against Supergirl, Cat Grant orders shock jock Leslie Willis to stop talking about Supergirl on the air. After she objects, Cat demotes her to the traffic chopper. After the helicopter ends up in a thunderstorm, it spins out of control before being saved by Supergirl which is when a lightning strikes Leslie through Supergirl. Eliza refuses to watch the news about the incident, questioning why Alex allowed Kara to put on the costume; Alex leaves, frustrated. After being discharged, Leslie discovers new electricity-based superpowers; she gets a rush from blasting a man with electricity. At the Danvers' Thanksgiving dinner, the tension between Alex and Eliza is palpable. Kara talks to a bored James, whom she encourages to have fun with Lucy. Alex then reveals she works for the DEO with Kara, in which Eliza, who is displeased by this news, asks if she thinks their father would be proud. After Alex and Winn leave, Kara asks Eliza why she's so hard on Alex. Cat then calls Kara into work because of a power outage. At CatCo, Kara determines they need Winn's help, before Leslie, now calling herself Livewire, attacks them. She transmits herself through the electrical equipment and attempts electrocuting Cat. Kara goes to get security, and returns as Supergirl to fight off Livewire, but finds Livewire is able to absorb her heat vision. Cat later reveals that her disapproving mother inspired her to become who she is, in order to defy her. She is surprised to learn of Kara's foster mother, only now learning Kara is an orphan. Eliza apologizes to Alex for what she said about her father and for being so hard on her and Alex apologizes for lying about the DEO. Hank determines that the lightning, which went through Kara, entered Leslie's body, turning her into Livewire. He suggests Livewire can be contained using an energy trap from the DEO's armory. Cat agrees to help by acting as bait, demanding an in-person confrontation; Livewire attacks Cat. The trap is damaged in the fight, but Supergirl uses her x-ray vision to find a water main, opens the water main to douse Livewire, short-circuiting her powers. The next day, Kara gives Winn leftovers and apologizes for her family drama; he, however, is grateful for being included, revealing his father is incarcerated. Kara is then distracted by James and Lucy arriving. Kara meets with Cat, who announces she is going to run a photo essay on soup kitchen volunteers, instead of the usual post-holiday celebrity gossip feature and tells Kara that she wants to know her better. That night, Eliza reveals to Kara and Alex that Jeremiah worked for the DEO. In flashback, Hank tracks down Kara after she used her powers to take Alex on a late-night flight; to prevent the DEO from taking her, Jeremiah agrees to work for them as an expert on Kryptonians. Eliza explains that when Jeremiah supposedly died in a plane crush, he was working for Hank; she has always been doubtful of the explanation. At the DEO, Hank congratulates Kara on capturing Livewire. Kara and Alex resolve to find out the truth about their father. Release Due to the November 2015 Paris attacks, the episode \\"How Does She Do It?\\", originally scheduled to air on November 16, 2015 as the fourth episode of the season, was pulled from air, due to content in the episode that was similar to the events. \\"How Does She Do It?\\" was later scheduled to air as the fifth episode on November 23, 2015. Reception=Ratings The episode attracted 1,015,000 viewers for its British premiere, making it the 3rd most watched programme on Sky One for the week. Critical response Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly notes in his assessment of the review, \\"Thanksgiving‚Äôs a bit early this year, or at least on Supergirl it is. Because of the tragic Paris attacks, CBS decided to switch out \\"How Does She Do It?,\\" an episode about a series of bombings in National City, with tonight‚Äôs Thanksgiving-themed episode \\"Livewire.\\" Thankfully, the switch doesn‚Äôt seem to have hurt the season‚Äôs flow, and it was definitely easy to follow along with everything in the episode. In fact, \\"Livewire\\" is definitely one of the strongest episodes of the season so far because it focuses on what Greg Berlanti shows do oh so well: family. \\"\\"Supergirl: Livewire\\" from Entertainment Weekly (November 16, 2015) Cliff Wheatley of IGN gave the episode a 7.2, saying, \\"Livewire\\" gives us our first really enjoyable villain in Supergirl, while managing to dig a lot deeper into the depths of Cat Grant. The action is fun, Brit Morgan hams it up as the titular villain, and getting some new insight on the Danvers family added some intrigue to the overarching series. Unfortunately, the flip side is drama with Alex and Eliza while Kara‚Äôs journey as a hero gets pushed to the side.\\" Stacy Glanzman of TV Fanatic gave the episode a 4.5 out of 5 stars.\\"Supergirl Season 1 Episode 3 Review: Fight or Flight\\" from TV Fanatic (November 9, 2015) ReferencesExternal links * 2015 American television episodes Supergirl (TV series) episodes Thanksgiving television episodes Television episodes about transhumanism ","title":"Livewire (Supergirl)"},{"id":"48573378","text":"Hercules Mulligan (September 25, 1740March 4, 1825) was an Irish-American tailor and spy during the American Revolutionary War. He was a member of the Sons of Liberty. Early life Born in Ireland to Hugh and Sarah Mulligan, Hercules Mulligan emigrated with his family to North America in 1746, settling in New York City, where he was raised from the age of six. Mulligan attended King's College (now Columbia University) in New York City. After graduating, Mulligan worked as a clerk for his father's accounting business. He later went on to open a tailoring and haberdashery business, catering to wealthy officers of the British Crown forces. On October 27, 1773 Mulligan married Elizabeth Sanders at Trinity Church, established by the Church of England. Sanders was the niece of Admiral Charles Sanders of the British Royal Navy. The couple had eight children: five daughters and three sons. Mulligan was introduced to Alexander Hamilton shortly after Hamilton arrived in New York by Mulligan's brother, Hugh. Mulligan also knew the Crugers, Hamilton's patrons for whom he had clerked in St. Croix. Mulligan helped Hamilton enroll at the Elizabethtown Academy grammar school in New Jersey to prepare for the College of New Jersey at Princeton (now Princeton University), where he placed Hamilton under the wing of William Livingston, a prominent American revolutionary. After Hamilton enrolled at King's College instead, he lived with Mulligan in New York City. Mulligan had a profound impact on Hamilton's desire for revolution. Involvement in the American Revolution In 1765, Mulligan became one of the first colonists to join the Sons of Liberty, a secret society formed to protect the rights of the colonists and to fight British taxation. In 1770, he helped to mob British soldiers in the Battle of Golden Hill. He was a member of the New York Committee of Correspondence, a group that rallied opposition to the British through written communications. In August 1775, he and the Corsicans, a New York volunteer militia company, while under fire from HMS Asia, captured four British cannons in the Battery. In 1776, Mulligan and the Sons of Liberty knocked down a statue of King George III in Bowling Green and then melted the lead to cast bullets to use against the British. Mulligan remained in New York as a civilian after Washington's army was driven out during the New York campaign in summer 1776. While staying with the Mulligan family, Alexander Hamilton came to share Mulligan's views. As a result, Hamilton wrote an essay in 1775 in favor of independence. When George Washington spoke of his need for reliable information from within New York City in 1776, after the Continental Army was driven out, Hamilton (who was then an officer on Washington's staff) recommended Mulligan due to his placement as tailor to British soldiers and officers. This proved to be incredibly successful, with Mulligan saving Washington's life on two occasions. The first occurred when a British officer, who requested a watch coat late one evening, told Mulligan of their plans: \\"Before another day, we'll have the rebel general in our hands.\\" Mulligan quickly informed Washington, who changed his plans and avoided capture. Mulligan's slave, Cato, was a Black Patriot who served as a spy together with Mulligan, and often acted the role of courier, in part through British-held territory, by exploiting his status as a slave, letting him pass on intelligence to the Continental Army without being detained. After the Revolutionary War Mulligan was cleared of suspicions of possible Loyalist sympathies after the British evacuated New York City and General Washington entered it at the end of the war, when Washington had breakfast with him on the day after.Chernow, Ron.

Following the Revolution, Mulligan's tailoring business prospered. He retired in 1820 and died in 1825, aged 84. Mulligan was buried in the Sanders tomb behind Trinity Church. When the church was enlarged, the Sanders tomb was covered. Today, there is a tombstone located in the southwest quadrant of the churchyard bearing Mulligan's name.

Ayres (1906‚Äì1952) was an American architect active in Indianapolis, Indiana from 1926 to 1945. Leslie F. Ayres was a well known architect and artist in Indianapolis, Indiana. He was known within the architectural circles for his highly refined and exquisite renderings. Ayres began his career early with the firm of Pierre and Wright. During his time with the firm he was awarded the Princeton Prize in Architecture in 1926, which allowed him to attend Princeton University, and eventually earn his certificate of proficiency in 1927. Upon his graduation from Princeton, he moved back to Indianapolis, and started his own firm. His renderings often done in watercolor and colored pencil were often used to sell the client on a project, and in 1948 National Architect stated he was ‚Äújust about the only professional renderer in Indiana. Personal life Ayres was born in 1906 in Indianapolis, Indiana to Frank and Bertha Wolf Ayres. The Ayres also had a younger son named Robert. The two brothers both attended Arsenal Technical High School where Leslie learned to draw and developed a passion for architecture. In 1937, Ayres married Edna C. Silcox. The two were together until he died of a heart attack in 1952 at the age of 46. They had no children. He is buried in Indianapolis, in the Washington Park East Cemetery Practice Leslie F. Ayres was recruited out of high school, by a young Indianapolis architect by the name of Edward Pierre. Pierre recognized his talent for rendering, and in 1925 he quickly gave Ayres a job in his newly formed company, Pierre & Wright He would later become Ayres‚Äô mentor, and Ayres stayed with the company until 1926, when he received the prestigious Princeton Prize in architecture. The award allowed him to attend Princeton University for one year for free tuition. During his time at Princeton, professors lauded him for his natural drawing ability, but his performance was somewhat lackluster, and professors often complained about his lack of focus on assignments. Despite his difficulties during his year there, Ayres earned his Certificate of Proficiency in 1927, and returned to Indianapolis. Upon his return to Indianapolis, Leslie Ayres began working as an architect and renderer in the area. He received work from his former employers, Pierre & Wright, as well as other prominent Indianapolis architectural firms such as Rubush & Hunter, A. M. Strauss, and Robert Frost Daggett. His renderings were very popular, often made in watercolor and colored pencil; they were used by architects to lend an air of sophistication to their projects, and were used to sell the client on the project. His early drawings depict a wide variety of subjects including: power plants, high schools, monuments, clubs, civic structures, and religious buildings. His professional drawings in the 1930s and 1940s depicted residences, apartment buildings, and churches. During a visit to the Chicago World‚Äôs Fair in 1933, Ayres sketched scenes from Belgian Village. In 1948, National Architect magazine described him as ‚Äújust about the only professional renderer in Indiana.‚Äù His most celebrated work was the design for the Wilkinson House in Muncie, Indiana, which he did in the early 1930s. An Art Moderne masterpiece, the house was, and still is, celebrated as one of the best examples of this style of residential architecture in Indiana. Ayres was also an active leader in the Indianapolis Home Show between 1940 and 1947. He designed many of the model homes used in the show during this time. His focus was on small sophisticated homes that did not trade style for square footage.

It was built by the Grand Trunk Railway (GTR) and opened in 1858. Union Station as seen from Toronto harbour in 1867 View of first Toronto Union Station, circa 1860s History Railways arrived in Toronto in 1853, when the first passenger train left Toronto from a wooden depot located near Bay and Front Streets. This was the line of the Ontario, Simcoe & Huron Railway. This was followed in 1855 by Great Western Railways (GWR), which connected Toronto to the west along the waterfront. The Grand Trunk Railway completed its Montreal‚ÄìToronto main line one year later. The three railways now converged at the Toronto waterfront, a narrow strip of land south of Front Street. They were forced to share the limited real estate available. As a consequence, the Grand Trunk Railway (GTR) built the first union station in Toronto in 1858 at a location just west of the present Union Station train shed. The location was landfill, south-west of Front and York Streets, then the intersection of York Street and The Esplanade along the water. The station consisted of three wooden structures and was initially shared with the Northern Railway of Canada (as the Ontario, Simcoe & Huron was renamed) and the Great Western Railway, although both railways built their own stations along the Toronto waterfront. It was Canada's first union station. It opened on June 21, 1858, known simply as the \\"New Station\\". Three GTR trains departed daily to the east (to Montreal and Kingston) and two to the west (through Guelph, Berlin and Stratford). In 1864, delegates from the Charlottetown and Quebec City conferences on the Canadian Confederation were welcomed at this station by a huge crowd which then escorted the delegates to the Queen's Hotel on Front Street. In 1866, the Great Western opened its own station at Yonge Street. It was the first station in Toronto to provide a covered train shed. In 1867, the Northern opened its City Hall station at Jarvis Street. By the 1870s, the 1858 station was inadequate. The station was demolished in 1871 and a temporary station was used while the Grand Trunk built a much larger, second Union Station at the same location, opening in 1873. The other railways continued to use their own stations but stopped at the Union Station as a courtesy to passengers. The location of the railway station is now buried under the -high railway viaduct on the western approach to the current Union Station.

Johnson (born 1955) is a research professor in the Departments of Preventive Medicine and Medicine in the College of Medicine at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center (UTHSC). She has been involved in at least five clinical world trials, including a Women's health initiative, the SPRINT Trial, the Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes) Study, the TARGIT Study and the D2d Trial. She has been noted by Thomson Reuters as one of the world's most-cited scientists. Biography Karen Lynn Chandler was born in 1955 in Memphis, Tennessee, to Colie Edward and Cecilia Chandler and grew up in Memphis, attending the Memphis Preparatory School. She continued her education earning an undergraduate degree at Lambuth University in 1978. She went on to earn her MD distinction at the University of Tennessee in 1985 and a Master of Public Health from Johns Hopkins University after her marriage. In 1990, she returned to her alma mater and joined the faculty of the UTHSC. Johnson has been a significant contributor to the university's research funding drives, bringing in $40 million toward her five on-going research projects. One of the projects, a Women's Health Initiative, began in 1993 and is evaluating diseases that effect women. The clinical trial involves more than 160,000 women. One of their findings was that women who consume two or more diet soft drinks each day face higher risks of heart problems than women who either don't drink them at all or drink them rarely. Another of her trials was the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT), which concluded in 2015. Its findings were that intervention could have a major impact on reducing blood pressure levels. Johnson is also the lead researcher on the Look AHEAD Study of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, which started in 2001 evaluating whether people with type 2 diabetes can prevent heart attack and other cardiovascular problems with weight loss and higher levels of physical activity. The study had been stopped in 2012, as preliminary indications of the 5,000 test subjects did not show positive changes from lifestyle intervention at the expected rates. Modifications in the program allowed it to be continued in 2014. In 2012, Johnson launched a clinic trial called TARGIT (Treating Adults at Risk for Weight Gain with Interactive Technology) funded by the National Institutes of Health. The program is designed to use iPod applications to support smoking cessation while eliminating weight-gain. In 2014, she began working on the D2d Trial (vitamin D and type 2 diabetes) aimed at determining if vitamin D intake lowers the risk of type 2 diabetes. From 2010 to 2014, Johnson served as the interim Chair of the Department of Preventive Medicine at UTHSC. In 2014, she was awarded the Kathryn Sullivan Bowld Endowment Fund Professorship in Women's Health from the College of Medicine at UTHSC.

As a theatre  On the site rose a new Auditorium Theatre, built for $250,000, which opened on September 12, 1904 with Keith's Vaudeville and moving pictures. It was designed by architectural firm J.D. Allen & Co. of Philadelphia. It was taken over by the Shubert Bros. in 1909 until 1913. Briefly operated by Poli, it returned to the Shuberts in 1918. The theatre remained mainly a playhouse, although occasional films were presented. In the summer of 1940, the Auditorium Theatre was remodeled again, this time to the plans of local architect E. Bernard Evander. The building reopened as the re- branded Mayfair Theatre on January 31, 1941 with the movie A Night at Earl Carroll's starring Ken Murray. By 1960 it had been equipped with 70mm projectors. Adjacent, just north of the Mayfair Theatre, a small parking lot marks the spot of the Stanley Theatre, Baltimore's once largest theatre until it was razed in May 1965. The theatre itself closed on April 22, 1986. Today the Mayfair Theatre is another vacant theatre building in downtown Baltimore City and has been vacant for more than three decades. Its roof collapsed in February 1998 and it was further damaged in a fire that occurred in an adjacent building in September 2014. As it was in general disrepair, engineers stated the crumbling building was a threat to public safety, and the structure (except the facade and the front lobby) was demolished in 2016. It remains, however, a designated Baltimore City landmark, which sits in the Market Center National Register Historic District.  Redevelopment  In 2016, the Baltimore Development Corporation (BDC) sought a Request For Proposals (RFP) to adaptively reuse the former Mayfair Theatre. By March 6, 2017, the BDC did not receive any bids from interested groups or developers, and reopened bidding in February 2018. In December 2018, the BDC selected Zahlco Development (of the 2 new bids offered), a local design and construction firm, to redevelop the site. Zahlco is planning to turn it into office retail and living space along with shopping venues next door that was once the site of the 1786 Golden Horse Tavern and 1900s New Academy Hotel that was recently torn down also due to structural concerns. The area would be called \\"Mayfair Place\\", will include new amenities include office space, a restaurant, gallery space, and an outdoor seating and performance area, as well as constructing new apartments and retail buildings, according to BDC meeting minutes.

It was designed by Leonard Kempster and built in 1924 by Queensland Department of Public Works. It is also known as Childers QATB and Isis District Centre QATB. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The former ambulance station building is situated on a prominent corner in the main street of Childers. It was erected in 1924 to plans prepared by Leonard Kempster of the Department of Public Works and is a single storey timber building comprising an ambulance station and superintendent's residence. The Queensland Ambulance Transport Brigade (QATB) began in Brisbane in 1892. It was formed by Seymour Warrian of the Army Medical Corps after seeing an accident victim suffer considerable aggravation of their injuries through inexpert transport to hospital. The Brigade aimed to provide first aid and skilled transport to hospital for the sick and injured. In the first years the Brigade was wholly funded by subscription, but met such an important need that from 1895 they were subsidised by the government, both directly and by involving the Department of Works in the construction of ambulance buildings. In the late 1890s and 1900s they expanded into regional centres. By 1921, a specific layout for ambulance buildings had been formalised into policy. This incorporated a space for vehicles with easy street access, a casualty room, meeting room and sleeping room for ambulance bearers on a ground floor level and residential quarters for the superintendent above. The Childers ambulance station differs from this scheme in that the rooms provided are the same but the residence is set on ground level slightly behind the station, rather than above it. This may have been so that the station complemented the court house complex and post office nearby. By the 1920s Childers was the centre of a thriving sugar growing and processing district in the Isis. The area was opened up by logging in the 1870s, followed by development as an agricultural area. The land in the immediate vicinity of the present town of Childers was surveyed in 1882 into farm blocks. There was no official town survey, Childers being developed by private subdivision at the railhead of the 1887 Isis railway line from Isis Junction railway station on the North Coast railway line. This was opened on 31 October 1887, and was intended principally to facilitate the transport of timber from the scrub. The coming of the railway not only promoted the development of the town of Childers; it also proved the catalyst for the establishment of a sugar industry in the district in the late 1880s. At the opening of the railway to Childers, Robert Cran, owner of Maryborough's Yengarie mill, announced that he would erect a double crushing juice mill at Doolbi, to supply his mill at Yengarie. This was completed in 1890, with the juice being brought in railway tankers from the Isis. Further expansion of the sugar industry in the Isis was closely related to the activities of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, which erected a central crushing mill in the district 1893-94, and began crushing in 1895. By 1895, at least three other mills had been established in the Isis, with another two under construction, and Childers had emerged as the flourishing centre of a substantial sugar-growing district: in the years between 1891 and 1900 the population grew from 91 to 4000. In 1903 the old Isis Divisional Board (1886) was abolished and Isis Shire proclaimed, with the new seat of municipal government moving from Howard to Childers. The first official hospital in Childers was opened in 1899 and members of the hospital committee acted as ambulance bearers when needed. In 1920, a Mr James Rushton purchased a garage, converted his Model T Ford and began a local ambulance service. He was instrumental in forming a QATB committee in Childers. The 1920s were a period in which public awareness of health issues grew, possibly triggered by the deadly influenza epidemics of the 1919-1920 period. The present hospital in Childers was built in 1929, but an ambulance station was constructed earlier in 1924. The Department of Works plans show the ambulance station as comprising a plant room (for the ambulance and equipment), casualty room, bearers' room, board room and superintendent's room. The building was lowset to allow vehicular access from Randall Street. Pedestrian access was via a porch with seating accommodation from Churchill Street. Set to one side and to the rear of the station was the superintendent's residence linked to the station through the casualty room. Changes have been minor and include an addition to the northern elevation of the plant room (a possibility indicated in the original plans), replacement of the garage doors with a roller door and the replacement of the timber picket fence with a wire fence. In 1986 the QATB came under the jurisdiction of the Minister for Police and Emergency Services. Following plans for the reorganisation of the service, the Brigade was disbanded on 30 June 1991 and the Queensland Ambulance Transport Service was established as part of the Bureau of Emergency Services. QAS constructed a new station on adjoining land in 1999 and offered the old station up for sale. It is now the Childers Neighbourhood Centre.  Description  The former QATB building is located on the northern side of Childers main street, Churchill Street, on the corner of Randall Street. It forms part of a government precinct with the Childers Court House located next door and Childers Post Office in the next block. The building is in fact two connected low-set single storey buildings, one housing the residence and the other the station and offices. Both buildings have gambrel roofs. The ambulance station is on the corner and at the street alignment, with the residence set to one side and to the rear. The station has a roller door opening to McIlwraith Street and on the opposite side of the building the roof extends over an entrance porch. It is plain in detail and is lit by sash windows shaded by sunhoods. A small gable facing Churchill Street holds a vertical sign with the word \\"Ambulance\\". The residence has a gabled roof which breaks pitch to extend over a sleeping verandah on the eastern side. There is projecting front gable with triple casement windows and the main entrance to the east of this has been widened and is now reached by a ramp. A row of narrow decorative casements, set with pink and green glass, extends along the front wall bedside the entrance and down the eastern side of the house along what was the entrance and sleeping verandah. A subsidiary skillion roof at the rear covers a laundry section.  Heritage listing  The former Childers Ambulance Station was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The building in Childers is important in illustrating the development of ambulance services in the state, the importance of Childers as a flourishing centre of the Isis, a substantial sugar-growing district, and the support provided by government to both the QATB and expanding agricultural districts. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. It is important as an example of an Interwar ambulance station and residence and demonstrates the quality of design, construction and detail achieved by the Public Works Department during this period. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The former ambulance station, due to its prominent position in the main street of Childers and its use of scale, form and materials, makes a major contribution to the townscape. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. It has close associations with the people of the Childers district as a community facility and with the work of the Queensland Ambulance Transport Brigade.

He was the first appointed \\"inner painter\\" to the sh≈çgun, to whom he remained close. Michinobu also used the art names Eisen (), Eisen'in (), and Hakugyokusai (). Life and career Michinobu was born with the given name Sh≈çzabur≈ç () on the 11th day of the 11th month of the year Ky≈çh≈ç (20 December 1730) in Edo (modern Tokyo). He was the first son of the Kan≈ç school painter Eisen Hisanobu (, or Kan≈ç Furonobu 1698‚Äì1731), who had taken over as head of the school from Kan≈ç Tsunenobu in 1728 and who died in 1731, the year after Michinobu's birth. Jusen Harunobu () was adopted into the family to carry on the line but also fell sick and died in 1731 at age 17. Michinobu was thus officially named to carry on the line. As he was an infant, he did not have an audience with the sh≈çgun whom he was to serve until 1741. Michinobu was prolific and ambitious and came to dominate the Kan≈ç school. In the face of the rising popularity of popular art of the Nanpin school, Michinobu strove to revive the Kan≈ç school's fading status and re-introduced the bold brush strokes of the school's Chinese-inspired roots. He won the deep favour of the sh≈çgun Tokugawa Ieharu (1737‚Äì86), to whom he remained close and who had Michinobu moved from his workshop in Takegawa to a mansion in Kobikich≈ç in central Edo. The branch flourished and Michinobu instructed large numbers of students. Under Ieharu's influence the Kobikich≈ç branch replaced the Nakabishi branch as the dominant branch of the Kan≈ç school. Portrait of , 18th century, ink and light colour on paper, 65.8 x 55.0 cm In 1762 the rank of h≈çgen‚Äîthe second highest for Buddhist priests‚Äîwas conferred on Michinobu. In 1763 he was made an \\"inner painter\\" ( oku-goy≈ç eshi), a title Ieharu had created that year for painters appointed to paint the sh≈çguns inner chambers and which gave the painter freedom to roam these chambers and personal access to the sh≈çgun. Michinobu lost influence after the death of Ieharu in 1786; the next sh≈çgun Ienari's senior councilor Matsudaira Sadanobu described him as \\"an adept painter and remarkably proficient at securing the patronage of important persons\\" and favoured other outside painters. On Michinobu's death in 1790 his son (1753‚Äì1808) succeeded as the head of the Kan≈ç school. Legacy Almost every major collection of Japanese art in the world has an example of Michinobu's prolific work. The declares him \\"the last member of a great house\\" who had \\"to labour without stint\\". His work was highly praised and was often judged the greatest since Kan≈ç Tan'y≈´'s, though writer Ueda Akinari stated he could not \\"detect much to admire in him\\". The shogunate retainer considered Michinobu \\"a good painter\\" who was \\"compromised\\" by his ambitions and self- promotion. The ukiyo-e artist Ch≈çbunsai Eishi (1756‚Äì1829) appears to have studied under Michinobu. Eishi may have received his art name from Michinobu, though tradition holds the sh≈çgun Ieharu bestowed it on him.

Rome soon begins to suffer from Commodus' excesses, and his mistress Marcia tries to entice him towards a less dissolute lifestyle. In response, he discards her and forces his attentions on a chaste Roman aristocrat named Aemelia. Unbeknownst to most of the world, Aurelius fathered twin sons; it was decided that one of them should be killed in order to prevent future contention over the throne. Tarruntius, the Roman Senator given this task, could not bear to take the infant's life and instead gave it to a foster family. Relocating Commodus' brother, who has grown up to be a fine Roman soldier under the name Lucius Crassus, Tarruntius encourages him to depose his reprehensible sibling and become the new Emperor. Commodus finds out about the plot, and orders his henchmen Laetus and Cleander to destroy the usurper. Lucius and two of his army comrades make their way to Rome, where they try to stir up a revolt and evade Laetus's Praetorian Guards. During a brief interval in captivity, Lucius meets and falls in love with Aemelia, who has been imprisoned for refusing to become Commodus's new mistress. He takes her along when he escapes, and she becomes a partner in his adventures. Unable to induce the populace of Rome to depose Commodus, Lucius personally confronts and kills his twin during a gladiatorial bout.

Her work transformed the study of rock art into a science. She was also active in the preservation of Aboriginal art in Western Australia.  Early Life and career  Vinnicombe was born in the Mount Currie District, East Griqualand, Cape Province, South Africa and grew up on the farm West Ilsey in the Underberg district, KwaZulu- Natal surrounded by rock art paintings in the Drakensberg mountains. She made her first copies of these paintings at the age of 13. She went to school in Underberg and Pietermaritzburg. San rock painting of eland She studied at the University of the Witwatersrand (WITS) and qualified as an occupational therapist in 1954 and later worked as a therapist in London. However, contact with the paleoanatomists Raymond Dart and Philip Tobias at WITS led her to concentrate on the study of rock paintings in the Drakensberg region. While at WITS she learnt basic rock art tracing techniques and she developed her own rock art tracing technique using polythene and watercolour tempera which was mixed with a detergent as fixative. During the time she was working in London as a therapist she also managed to exhibit her work at the Imperial Institute. The positive response to the exhibit led her to develop a more detailed method of copying the paintings, based on 23 attributes. The credibility of Vinnicombe's method provided her with the opportunity to return to South Africa and trace rock paintings in the Drakensberg. The Pinnacle outside Graskop on the Drakensberg Escarpment in Mpumalanga  The Drakensberg  In 1958 she undertook a detailed survey of the Drakensberg to record all the rock paintings within it. This research was sponsored by the Human Sciences Research Council and was conducted under the supervision of B.D. Malan, secretary of the Historical Monuments Commission. They devised a programme of numerical analysis which could be performed using punched cards. It was while working in the Drakensberg that Vinnicombe met archaeologist Patrick Carter who had been excavating in Lesotho and KwaZulu-Natal. They married in 1961 and when they returned to Cambridge, England she was awarded a Research Fellowship at Clare Hall. This allowed her to continue to analyse the data she had collected in the Drakensberg. She was profoundly influenced by anthropological theory and encouraged by the anthropologists Edmund Leach and Isaac Schapera and by archaeologist Peter Ucko. This led her to explore records of San history, life and belief and during this time she worked closely with John Wright and corresponded with David Lewis-Williams. She also consulted with the Natal Archives in Pietermaritzburg, the Natal Society library, the Killie Campbell Africana Museum and the Natal Museum to obtain more information about the history and background of the San. San family In 1967 the South African Archaeological Bulletin published her methodology and the South African Journal of Science published some preliminary results from among the 8,478 images she had recorded. The study indicated that art from different regions could be compared using numerical techniques. This idea would ultimately transform the study of South African rock art into a scientific pursuit. In 1972 she published her article Myth, motive and selection in Southern African Rock Art in which she combined San ethnography and rock art with particular emphasis on images of the eland antelope, the most commonly depicted image in San rock art. In 1976 she published the book People of the Eland: rock paintings of the Drakensberg Bushmen as a reflection of their life and thought. The University of Natal published the book and the University of Cambridge awarded her a PhD. At the time of Vinnicombe's death the book was still a widely used reference book. Vinnicombe and Carter worked for periods in Ghana, Tanzania, Ethiopia and Egypt. Vinnicombe assisted in documenting UNESCO sites that were later flooded by the filling of the Aswan dam in Egypt. In 1974 Carter and Vinnicombe searched for rock art sites in the Hadar and Dire Dawa provinces of Ethiopia. Aboriginal rock carving in Burrup Peninsula, Australia  Rights, land claims and welfare  In 1978, Vinnicombe emigrated with her son to Australia where she was employed by the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies (AIA) in Canberra and the National Parks and Wildlife Service in New South Wales. She also spent time in Sydney surveying aboriginal sites in the North Hawkesbury Archaeological Project, prior to construction of a dam in the area. The project ended in 1980 and Vinnicombe's report on this work, entitled Predeliction and Prediction: a study of Aboriginal sites in the Gosford-Wyong region, was never published. Vinnicombe used the data from the North Hawkesbury project to determine various characteristics of Aboriginal rockshelters. These were then applied to rockshelters in the Mangrove Creek Dam area prior to the dam's completion to determine if they had been inhabited. The research was then expanded beyond rockshelters and led to a concept called Potential Archaeological Deposits - sites that showed the characteristics of having been previously inhabited and could contain artefacts. In areas where these sites were threatened they could be identified and test excavated. This enabled the detection of archaeological sites before they were discovered (and potentially damaged) by construction work. From 1980 she worked as Research officer in the department of Aboriginal sites at the Western Australian Museum in Perth and was mainly concerned with Aboriginal rights, land claims and welfare. She claimed it was easier to interpret Aboriginal art since she could ask the Aborigines what the intentions of the painters were. In the 1990s Vinnicombe became involved in an environmental lobby action in the Burrup Peninsula, Western Australia where aboriginal engraving were threatened by chemical emissions from the gas industry located there. In 1997, she retired, but continued her work with a grant from the AIA as an Honorary member of the Western Australian Museum. One area of her research was Bardi Jawi dancing boards. Vinnicombe returned to South Africa for 3-month-long periods in 2001 and 2002 to work at the Rock Art Research Institute at the University of the Witwatersrand. She spent this time, with the help of her assistant J. Olofsson, cataloguing copies of rock art that she had made in the 1950s and 1960s which had not been looked at since. This work was funded by the Swan Fund of Oxford University. She was expected to return to South Africa again in May 2003 but she died suddenly on 30 March 2003 in Karratha, Western Australia. She had been on a field trip at the time with a colleague from South Africa, Warren Fish. They had been investigating possible damage to aboriginal art caused by industrial emissions, as she had done in the 1990s. Selected publications Vinnicombe, Patricia.

Early life and education Sprague Smith was born on August 27, 1853 in Andover, Massachusetts to Caroline L. and Charles Sprague Smith. He studied at Amherst College, graduating in 1874, and for six additional years in Europe. Career=Educator He taught at Columbia University beginning in 1880 as a professor of Germanic languages. He then taught comparative literature and modern languages beginning in 1882 and until 1891, when his career as an educator ended due to poor health. People's Institute He founded and served as managing director of the People's Institute beginning in 1897. The work of the organization was focused in The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, where Sprague Smith presided over the People‚Äôs Forum that was influential within the state of New York and had a national reputation. The Institute's work included a system of social and civic clubs, a bureau of civic and legislative information, and publicity of civic topics in the media. A program developed from the organization provided for more than 100,000 students and workers to attend music and theatre venues at a reduced rate. The institute was responsible for and administered the Board of Censorship of Motion Pictures. He was managing director until his death. The People's Institute flourished after his death. For instance, John Collier worked as secretary of the People's Institute from 1907 to 1919. He developed programs for immigrant neighborhoods, emphasizing pride in their traditions, sponsoring lectures and pageants, and political awareness.

When he worked as a technician in the 1950s, he invented the \\"Ni Zhifu drill\\" which earned him a patent and the honour of \\"model worker\\". During the Cultural Revolution, he was elevated to leadership positions in the municipal government of Beijing and became an alternate member of the Politburo. He was not close to the Gang of Four, and for that reason his career continued to rise when the Gang fell at the end of the Cultural Revolution in 1976. He became a full member of the Politburo, and served as Deputy Communist Party Chief of Shanghai municipality, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Party Chief of Tianjin municipality, and Vice Chairman of the National People's Congress. Early life and invention Ni Zhifu was born in Shanghai in May 1933, and became an apprentice at Shanghai Detai Factory in 1950. In June 1953 he was transferred to the state-owned 618 Factory (also known as Yongding Machinery Plant) in Beijing to work as a fitter. While at the factory he invented the \\"Ni Zhifu drill\\", which greatly enhanced the performance and life of drills, and for which he was later granted a patent. He joined the Communist Party of China in 1958 and was named a national \\"model worker\\" in 1959. He was promoted to deputy chief engineer of the 618 Factory in 1965, and later chief engineer. Cultural Revolution Ni was a major beneficiary of the Cultural Revolution, but unlike many supporters of the Gang of Four, he owed his rise to prominence to his contribution to production. In 1969, Ni became a member of the 9th Central Committee of the CPC, and in 1973, when a third of the 10th Central Committee were workers and peasants, Ni became an alternate member of the 10th Politburo, one of the four people representing the \\"masses\\" in the Politburo. He also served as a party secretary and a deputy director of the Revolutionary Committee of Beijing from 1973 to 1976. He was believed to be closer to the Communist Party bureaucrats than the Gang of Four, and likely tried to check the influence of the Gang in the capital's militia and trade union, which were both under his charge. Post-Cultural Revolution When the Gang of Four fell at the end of the Cultural Revolution in 1976, Ni was sent to Shanghai to take over the city's militia and trade union, which had been under the control of Wang Hongwen, one of the Four. He was also made the Second Party Secretary (deputy party chief) of Shanghai. He was then transferred back to Beijing in 1977 to serve as the capital's Second Party Secretary. That same year, Ni, 44, was elected as a full member of the 11th Politburo. At the Ninth Trade Union Congress in 1978, Ni was elected as Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU), which was seen as a striking change partly because of Ni's relatively young age. He served as the ACFTU chairman for three consecutive terms until 1993, and was re-elected to the 12th Politburo in 1982. From October 1984 to August 1987 he concurrently served as Party Chief of the municipality of Tianjin. From 1988 to 1998 he served as a Vice Chairperson of the National People's Congress. In 1999 he became President of the Chinese Inventors' Association, which he had cofounded in 1985. He was elected to the CPC Central Committee for seven consecutive terms, from the 9th CC in 1969 until the end of the 15th CC in 2002. On 24 April 2013, Ni died in Beijing of an illness. He was 79.

At 20 years old, he won the First Prize and gold medal at the Leeds International Piano Competition in 2018. Biography Eric Lu was born in Massachusetts to immigrant parents from Kaohsiung and Shanghai. He grew up in Bedford, Massachusetts, and started piano studies at the age of six with Dorothy Shi (), near Boston, Massachusetts. Later on, he enrolled at the New England Conservatory Preparatory School, where he studied piano with Alexander Korsantia and A. Ramon Rivera. In 2013, he was admitted into the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, where he currently studies with Jonathan Biss and Robert McDonald. He is also a pupil of the pianist Dang Thai Son. In 2018, at age 20, Lu won the First Prize and gold medal at the Leeds International Piano Competition. He was the first American pianist to do so since Murray Perahia. He played Beethoven Piano Concerto No. 4 in the finals with the Hall√© Orchestra conducted by Edward Gardner. After winning, he was immediately signed by Askonas Holt and Warner Classics. His first concert after winning Leeds was a debut with the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra and Vasily Petrenko. Subsequent notable debuts have included recitals at Wigmore Hall, Amsterdam Concertgebouw, Louis Vuitton Foundation in Paris, Saint Petersburg Philharmonia, and Shanghai Grand Theatre. His UK recital debut in Bristol was praised by The Guardian: 'Lu seems already to possess something of the magic touch of early Leeds laureates Murray Perahia and Radu Lupu'. In June 2019, Lu replaced Martha Argerich in a concert with the Singapore Symphony Orchestra. Lu made his debut at the 2019 BBC Proms at London's Royal Albert Hall with the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra and Yu Long. In October 2015, Eric Lu was a prizewinner at the 17th International Fryderyk Chopin Piano Competition in Warsaw, Poland at 17 years old. He was one of the youngest laureates in the history of the competition. He joins the likes of pianists such as Krystian Zimerman, Daniil Trifonov, and Yundi Li, who also won prizes in this competition while still in their teens. Earlier in 2014, he won 1st Prizes at the Moscow International Fryderyk Chopin Competition for Young Pianists, and the US National Chopin Competition in Miami (2015).

Karkarichikat is known for having some of the oldest dated evidence for intentional dental modification. The modified teeth found at Karkarichikat Nord is the first area in the region to show evidence of this practice. Most modifications would be a result from trauma or due to a specific task-related wear, such as chewing on tree bark. These modifications, however, appear to have been done for aesthetic purposes.

It took place at Lahore in current day Punjab province of Pakistan. After the Mughals were defeated, Abdali decided to retain Mannu as the city's governor on his own behalf.  Conflict  Ahmed Shah Abdali invaded India seven times from 1748 to 1767. The frequency of his repeated invasions reflected his \\"tireless energy, ambition\\" and purpose. Being poor as well as a \\"backward country\\", Afghanistan could not provide subsistence to its population or provide a financial support for running the government. So it was \\"necessary\\" for Abdali to invade a \\"rich but poorly defended neighbouring country\\" India to plunder and exploit her resources. He also wanted to establish \\"political hegemony\\" in India. During his time, the Mughal empire was disintegrating and he was \\"eager to step into the shoes of the decadent Mughal authority\\" to fill up the \\"political vacuum without any loss of time\\". In the winter of 1751, he invaded India for the third time on the pretext that Mir Mannu, the Mughal governor of the province of Punjab, had refused to pay him tax which he had promised to give on a monthly basis. Abdali started the battle by successfully besieging Mannu in the Lahore Fort. Though Mannu wrote to the Mughal emperor Ahmad Shah Bahadur for help, he received no reinforcements from Delhi. Failing to put up a fight, he surrendered to Abdali on 6 March 1752. After signing the instrument of surrender, Abdali's forces looted and plundered the city. On his orders, nine hundred Sikhs who were trapped in the fort of Ram Rauni were killed. But Abdali was impressed by the \\"heroic fight\\" put up by the Mughal governor; so he appointed him as the province's governor on his own behalf. Abdali also conferred him the title \\"Farzand Khan Bahadur Rustam-e-Hind\\". Consequently, Mannu held a reception at Lahore in honour of Abdali. He also signed a peace treaty under which the two territories of Punjab ‚Äì Multan and Lahore - were to be ceded to Abdali's Afghan empire. Once the treaty was signed, Abdali sent his troops to Multan to take possession of the city and some of his men to Delhi to confirm the treaty with the Mughal emperor Ahmad Shah Bahadur. Bahadur, with advice from the royal advisor Javed Khan, put his seal on the treaty on 3 April, which cut Punjab from the Mughal empire. At that time, the wazir of Delhi Safdar Jang was in Awadh to suppress a rebellion. He returned at the end of the month with fresh recruits to confront Abdali, but learned of the treaty and retreated.

Sharif Sakr of Engadget called the form factor of the device \\"neat\\" and the Snapdragon processor \\"aging\\", and said that the device has \\"decent- looking build quality and styling\\". Bogdan Bele of Android Authority noted that the device was intended for \\"more budget-conscious\\" customers that are \\"willing to make some serious compromises in terms of features\\". Andy Boxall of Digital Trends commented that the device looks \\"sleek and stylish\\" in its official pictures. Kate Solomon of TechRadar described the device as \\"diminuitive [sic] size with ageing specs\\". PhoneArena gave the device a score of 6.5 out of 10. The review noted that the small size of the device meant that it was easy to hold, and the volume and power buttons were easy to press with tactile feedback. The 3.5 inch display was criticized for its low size and resolution, causing the web browsing to be \\"rather uninspiring\\", and the Sense 4.0 user interface \\"doesn't look all that pretty\\" at the screen resolution. Performance was relatively slow due to the entry level processor and 512 MB of RAM, and only 1 GB of the 4 GB of internal storage was accessible for the user.

Born in Swan Village in Staffordshire, Whitehouse began working underground at a coal mine when he was eight years old. He took part in his first strike when only ten, and within the next couple of years had experience two accidents at the pit.Margaret 'Espinasse, Dictionary of Labour Biography, vol.IV, pp.196-197 Whitehouse became an active trade unionist, and by 1867 was secretary of the lodge. He supported a Liberal Party candidate in a local Parliamentary election in 1867, and as a result was sacked. Out of work for some months, he spent the time learning to read and was soon back at a different mine, where he was elected checkweighman. He was also elected as the agent for the West Bromwich Miners' Association, was a founder of the Amalgamated Association of Miners, and was elected to the West Bromwich School Board. He also worked part-time for the Labour Tribune newspaper. When the Midland Miners' Federation was established in 1886, Whitehouse was elected as its first secretary. He served for two years, until he took up a full-time post as agent for the Somerset Miners' Association. Almost immediately after starting, he was taken to court by a local mine-owner; he lost the case, but refused to pay the fine, and bailiffs took many of his possessions. However, he remained in the post and managed to greatly increase members. Whitehouse was Somerset's delegate to the founding conference of the Miners' Federation of Great Britain, and served on its executive on several occasions. He was also elected to Radstock Urban District Council as a Liberal-Labour member, serving from 1893 to 1898. He retired from his union post in 1917 due to poor health, and died two years later.

A regenerative city maintains a symbiotic, mutually beneficial relationship with its surrounding hinterland not only by minimizing its environmental impact but by actively improving and regenerating the productive capacity of the ecosystems from which it depends. The concept of a Regenerative City was first developed by an International Expert Commission on Cities and Climate Change convened by the World Future Council jointly with Hamburg University for Architecture and Urban Development (HCU) between 2008 and 2011. The Commission consisted of urban planning experts, climate scientists, representatives of the United Nations, politicians and the private sector. The concept was first presented through the report ‚ÄúRegenerative Cities‚Äù in 2010 and further expanded in various subsequent reports as well as in the book titled ‚ÄúCreating Regenerative Cities‚Äù by Herbert Girardet. Since 2011 the concept was also recurrently discussed during the annual Future of Cities Forum. The regenerative city is also included in the principles for the New Urban Paradigm as outlined in The City We Need document compiled by the UN-Habitat advocacy and partnership platform the World Urban Campaign. The City We Need, whose aim is to set key principles and establish essential paths for building a New Urban Agenda towards the Habitat III conference, states that ‚Äúthe city we need is a regenerative city‚Äù.'' Examples of cities committing to the regenerative city concept include the city of Wittenberg in Germany which declared its intention to become a regenerative city in 2013. Similarly, Iowa City in the U.S. launched the Regenerative City Initiative in 2014, consisting of various projects and strategies to transform the city into a regenerative city.  Going beyond urban sustainability  At the core of the regenerative city concept lies the understanding that it is essential to go beyond a restrictive definition of sustainability and embrace a broader model of urban development that puts the emphasis on the need for cities not to only to sustain but to actively regenerate the natural resources they need and absorb. While the original definition of sustainable development states that ‚Äúsustainable development is a development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs‚Äù regenerative urban development recognizes that considering the speed and scale of current resource consumption, the ability of future generations to meet their own needs is many times already compromised. For example, in 2013, by August consumption worldwide had already overshot the earth‚Äôs annual natural production. For the rest of the year humanity was incurring resource debt. Therefore, in light of the problems related to resource consumption and overshoot, regenerative cities strive not only to stop consuming natural resources at a rate which is faster than ecosystems can recover, but reverse the trend by actively improving the regenerative capacity of ecosystems they rely on.  Linear resource flows in an urbanising world  Currently most cities are heavily dependent on resources which are consumed and wasted with little consideration to their origin or their final destination. Input resources such as water, food, energy and goods are imported from well beyond the cities¬¥ boundaries to be consumed by city dwellers and discarded in the form of waste and pollution to air, water and land. In order to meet the increasingly high level of energy demand, cities import and burn fossil fuels whose output pollutes the air and increases the level of greenhouse gases which cause climate change. Raw materials are continuously extracted to meet an ever increasing consumer demand and very often exit the consumption chain in the form of waste to landfill that cannot be reabsorbed by nature. Nutrients and carbon are removed from farmland as food is harvested, processed and eaten and the resulting waste is discharged into rivers and coastal waters downstream from population centres and usually not returned to farmland. Rivers and oceans become increasingly contaminated by sewage, toxic effluents and mineral run-offs. This deleterious relationship in which cities are unable to interact in a mutually beneficial way with the ecosystems on which they depend is putting at risk the long-term viability of urbanization. Regenerative urban development is based on the understanding that if urban areas are to continue to offer individuals around the world the prospect of an improved quality of life and ability to realise their potential and aspirations, they must embrace their role in ensuring that the earth‚Äôs life support systems remain healthy and sound. This can be achieved by adopting a model of urban development which enables cities to interact symbiotically with their surrounding environment and actively improve the degraded conditions of their supporting ecosystems.  The regenerative vision  First of all, the development of a regenerative city requires a switch in paradigm away from the old linear metabolism ‚Äì which allows cities to operate within an isolated segment of the resource cycle ‚Äì to a new circular metabolism. Regenerative urban development seeks to mimic the circular metabolic systems found in nature where all waste becomes organic nutrients for new growth. In regenerative cities priority is given to closing the urban resource cycle which means finding value in outputs that are conventionally regarded as waste and using them as resource inputs in local and regional production systems. For example, a regenerative city reintroduces treated water into the hydrology cycle, sources food from urban and peri-urban producers, captures the nutrients from its sewage and waste to be applied to surrounding agricultural land, reduces its dependence on petroleum products and boosts the deployment of renewable energies particularly from local sources. Closing resource loops in this way is the first fundamental step toward regenerative development. The second step is to actively work to regenerate the materials and resources the city uses, making the regenerative city a node of production. This can be aided by developing ecosystem service infrastructure within the urban area which improves the self-sufficiency of cities and their ability to meet their own demand for energy, food, water and goods from resource within the city‚Äôs boundaries or from the surrounding areas. While many cities, especially megacities and those located in resource-poor regions, may not be able to meet all their needs within their own borders, they can employ a concept of subsidiarity: to seek opportunities to optimise urban and peri-urban production as much as possible before relying on the surrounding region, only after which they would look further afield. This renewed, enhanced relationship between cities and their hinterland and between urban and rural areas is a key aspect of regenerative cities.  The fundamental processes for implementation  Beyond ensuring the long-term environmental sustainability of urbanization, implementing the regenerative city also means creating opportunities for local economic growth, enhanced liveability and well-being, better public spaces, improved social equality and cohesion, greater democratic participation, and stronger urban resilience. The implementation of regenerative cities is enabled by adopting a series of processes and policy solutions that create cites which are dynamic centres of democracy, public engagement, human development, innovation, urban regeneration, well-being, justice and equality. The key processes and recommendations to pave the way towards the regenerative city include: # Vision, leadership and long-term target setting # Citizen participation and democracy # Multi-stakeholder engagement and cross sectoral cooperation # Multi-level governance and vertical coordination # Enhanced targets and indicators # Communication, education and behavioural change # Improved research and connection to policy- making  Further reading  * Girardet, Herbert (2015), Creating Regenerative Cities, Routledge, U.K.  References  Urban renewal ","title":"Regenerative city"},{"id":"48575386","text":"Dmitry Fedorovich Loza (Russian: –î–º–∏—Ç—Ä–∏–π –§—ë–¥–æ—Ä–æ–≤–∏—á –õ–æ–∑–∞; 14 April 1922 ‚Äì 22 May 2001) was a Ukrainian Red Army Colonel and Hero of the Soviet Union.

The structure was first opened to the public in 1959 under the name of \\"Marland House\\", and at the time it was owned by the General Post Office. It was acquired by the University in 1987 from British Telecom by the organization of the University. In 1991 it was renamed for the outgoing principal Sir Graham Hills. It is built between George Street and Richmond Street, and serves as one of the main lecture hall buildings in the campus (and will keep on doing so until 2018, when Strathclyde will go through with its vacating plans). Graham Hills is also one of the primary connections between the lower side buildings of the campus and the ones on the top of the hill.Front view of Graham Hills, as seen from George Street. History of Graham Hills The building of Graham Hills was first opened in 1959 by Post Office Telephones under the name of Marland House after two years of construction. The name Marland House was derived from a pub known as Marland Bar, which used to stand on the site prior to the slum clearances of the 1950s. The building was mainly occupied and used by the engineering teams of the organisation, however, people could still pop up to pay their bills at any given time for a few years. Following British Telecom's privatisation in 1981, many of the old buildings from the GPO era of the company were earmarked for disposal, of which Marland House was one. It was then that Strathclyde University pressed forward and acquired the building from BT in order to turn it into an academic building.. The building was formally named after Graham Hills in 1991, when he stepped down as Principal and Vice Chancellor. The conversion process lasted nearly ten years, with BT staff still occupying parts of the building until 1992, when they eventually moved out completely and areas of the building lay undeveloped as 1997. Since then it has been hosting hundreds of students every day across its multiple labs and lecture halls, although it has been revealed that the University has considered vacating it by 2018. General Characteristics The building itself is divided into four independent, unconnected wings which forces students to leave and re-enter the building from another side in order to access one of the other wings. The primary use of the building is for use in tutorials due to the large number of small rooms which are ideal for small groups of students. The small rooms are able to seat around 10 - 15 students which encourages learning in group and allows for more individual attention from tutors. That being said, several lectures of moderate student sizes are being held in The Graham Hills building, most notably ones organized by the faculty of Business and Administration. The designated lecture halls in Graham Hills can hold up to three hundred students each. The building also contains several computer labs in which many online tests are held and provides facilities for students to complete assignments which require the use of computers. The labs are often used by the business school to hold its first year tests. The building itself contains four separate lifts for access to all nine floors. The building is not for any department in particular, instead it is used by a variety of academic service departments with labs for electrical engineers as well as computer labs for computer science students. Psychology students have their own floor as well for use in tutorials and lectures. In addition to the above listed, most department-organized events take place within the building of Graham Hills. Strathclyde Wonderwall Strath Wonderwall On the exterior of the building are various murals spray-painted (in the form of graffiti) by the popular local artists Rogue One and Ejek. These contain an artwork of a lecture hall on the building by the corner of George street and North Portland Street. The mural has a mixture of colour and black and white imagery; as if to convey the combination of older class and modern studying. Along with the murals there is also the famous Strath wonder wall which sports its own hashtag #Strathwonderwall to encourage students and other people to post their photos on social media sites. The wall contains paintings of figures such as Scottish engineer - John Logie Baird, the T.A.R.D.I.S from the popular British television series Doctor Who and even an illustration Frankenstein‚Äôs Monster. The wall serves as a pleasant reminder for Glasgow‚Äôs colourful and artistic culture. In recent times a mural was painted depicting the land-ship which was once situated on the roof of what was at the time, The School of Navigation. It is expected that this new mural was created to show of part of the universities history in time for the vast number of tourists that would be visiting Glasgow for the Commonwealth Games. On another side of the building is a mural of a Dansken equatorial telescope which is a tribute to the nautical telescope that used to be on the top floor in what was the Royal Technical College [5]. Several plans have been made to expand the collection of artworks on the other sides of the building as well, since for the time being the only walls that are decorated are the ones facing the main area of George Street and the entrance to the building. Facilities, services, offices There are several facilities, services and offices occupying the halls of Graham Hills, concerning (among others) various fields of studies and research. A considerable number of Departments also host their Department Offices within the walls of this building. If one was to categorize this array of facilities, it can be said they're divided in groups of Study Centers (or Teaching Rooms), Service information offices and Department offices. A brief mapping of what is available in Graham Hills follows: Level 1: Information Technology Services. Level 2: Centre for Academic Practice, West of Scotland KTP Centre, 3Ls Student Common Room, Capella Nova, Centre for Lifelong Learning, Security Office, restrooms. Level 3: Research and Innovation rooms, Senior Studies Institute, Learning in Later Life Students Association Office, restrooms. Level 4: Policy Unit, Car Park, Disability Service, International and Graduate Office, Schools & Colleges Liaison Service, Student Counselling, restrooms. Level 5: Geography & Sociology (Department Office), Teaching Rooms, Psychology (Department Office), restrooms. Level 6: David Livingstone Centre for Sustainability, Computer Rooms for Central Teaching, Human Resources Teaching Room, Learning Services Teaching Room, Psychology (Department Office), several other teaching rooms, restrooms. Level 7: Electronic and Electrical Engineering faculties, Law teaching rooms, restrooms, Center for Lifelong Learning (Department Office), Languages for Business Office, Scottish Centre for Occupational Health and Safety, restrooms. Level 8: Faculty of S.B.S, Human Resource Management (Department Office), Internal Audit, Management Science, Safety Services, teaching rooms, Unison, restrooms. Level 9: Strathclyde Science and Technology Forum, Human Resource Management, European Policies Research Centre. The building of Graham Hills hosts the largest number of offices in terms of departmental variety throughout the entire campus. Future of Graham Hills It has been said the University is planning on vacating the building by 2018, but no official confirmation has been given yet. It is possible that the university has decided against vacating the building by 2018 due to the introduction of new lifts as well as a new front entrance. Reception Contrary to popular belief, and despite the University's plans to abandon the building, students of the University of Strathclyde find Graham Hills among the most favorable buildings to have in their curriculum and their daily schedules. However some have argued that the building is rather confusing to navigate and often quite dark. A big percentage of them agree that Graham Hills is a building worth keeping as part of the campus, and that its location and small classrooms offer a more personalized style of learning. Students have however, indicated that they would welcome refurbishment. What is also worth mentioning is that due to Graham Hill's positioning in the campus, it is the students' route of convenience on rainy days, when walking uphill to the rest of the buildings can be a tedious process. Instead, a good number of students opt to use the general entrance of the building at George Street, and proceed to take the lift to the 4th floor exit (Richmond Street), before they follow into Colville Building, Architecture Building, or proceed to the building of John Anderson.

The temporary passenger station's exact location within the goods yard is believed to be the goods shed on the eastern side of Chandos Street.

Synopsis  Begum/Maa/Aapa Begum (Shagufta Ejaz) is an overbearing woman who runs her household, of numerous servants and children, with an iron fist. The reason for this being that she was widowed at a very early age and was left solely responsible for her husband's vast inheritance and three children; daughters Batool Zehra, Manahil and son Paras (Babar Khan). Her strong hold and unconditional love for her son has made him a mama's boy who prefers staying at home painting and writing poetry instead of taking interests in the worldly affairs. Something that really worries his phuppho (Seemi Pasha) and phuppha, as their daughter is betrothed to him and they see him as a failure in life (the betrothed daughter is yet to make an appearance). Beghum fails to see any shortcomings in her son and remains adamant that she won't quit pampering him, going as far as saying: ‚ÄúAgar wo chand sitaray bhi mangenge tou mai aasman se tordh ke laongi.‚Äù In stark contrast to Paras, Iman (Fatima Effendi), daughter of Beghum's servant Munawwar (Sohail Aghar), is a bold confident girl who flies kites, plays cricket and shuns hand-me-downs given to her by Beghum. Iman's mother left her when she was a baby and she has been bought up by her father in Beghum's household. She dreams of big houses and expensive cars and studies Home Economics. Her educational fee is also one of Beghum's many favours to her hence her straight forwardness and boldness irks Beghum very much who wants to break her spirit and mould her like the other obedient servants. The first episode sees the two leads, Paras and Iman engage in harmless chatter and there are no signs of attraction between the two as they are poles apart.

She contributed to the renewal, since 1950s, of the art of puppetry in Europe and the rest of the world. She was director of Tandarica Theatre of Bucharest. From 2000 until 2004 she was president of the International Puppetry Association in Charleville-Mezieres, in Ardennes, and co-founded with Jacques Felix, the National School of Puppetry Arts in that city. In 1978 she won the Erasmus Prize together with other noted puppeteers Yves Joly, Peter Schumann and the Napoli brothers. Biography Born in Ia≈üi, Romania, Niculescu discovered a puppetry troupe that considered its art theatrical and directed accordingly its projects. The puppet theater at that time was neither structured nor professionalized in Romania; instead small groups of artists drew their characters from folk tradition. At the same era, the Romanian Communist Party took power and abolished the monarchy, proclaiming the People's Republic of Romania on December 30, 1947. The Party then created a new network of cultural institutions controlled by the state. As part of this effort, Niculescu was invited by the Romanian Ministry of Culture to help bring puppetry to a new level as national theater. In this new field Niculescu began studies at the Institute of Theater and Film Art (IATC) in Bucharest, and then became director at the Tandarica Theater of Bucharest. At that time she was 23 years old and remained in this position from 1949 to 1986. As director, she received the Erasmus Prize on behalf of the group in 1978, when it was recognized for being \\"a colourful and imaginative theatre that has had a fertile influence on post-war puppetry\\". In 1985‚Äì1986, after 37 years as head of the Tandarica Theater, Niculescu (with Jacques Felix) launched the International Institute of Puppetry in Ardennes. Three years later, again with Felix, she founded the National School of Puppetry in Charleville Mezieres, and then served as its director from 1987 to 1998. Niculescu died on 19 August 2018 in Charleville-M√©zi√®res, France at the age of 92.D√©c√®s de Margareta Niculescu, co-fondatrice de l'Ecole Nationale Sup√©rieure de la Marionnette de Charleville-M√©zi√®res Works * Svƒõtov√© loutk√°≈ôstv√≠ : souƒçasn√© loutkov√© divadlo slovem i obrazem, 1966, in Czech. * The puppet theatre of the modern world; an international presentation in word and picture, UNIMA, 1967, English and German. * Puppentheater der Welt; zeitgen√∂ssisches Puppenspiel in Wort und Bild, UNIMA, 22 reprints 1965 ‚Äì 1968 in Germany. * Marionnettes du monde entier : th√©√¢tres de marionnettes contemporains, UNIMA, 1967, French. * L'avant-garde et la marionnette, 1988, French. * Die Avantgarde und das Figurentheater, 1993, in German. * Marionnettes en territoire br√©silien, Festival mondial des th√©√¢tres de marionnettes, 1994, in French. * Passeurs et complices (Passing it on), Institut international de la marionnette, in French and English, 2009.

It was announced on 16 November 2015 and will power the Cessna Denali, it first ran on December 22, 2017, and should be certified in 2020. The engine aims for 20% better efficiency than its competition thanks to a 16:1 overall pressure ratio, variable stator vanes, cooled turbine blades, 3D printed parts and FADEC. Development After introducing the General Electric H80 in 2010 to improve the Walter M601, GE started analyzing its competition and devised a clean- design engine in 2014, then was selected for the Cessna Denali competition. In September 2015, General Electric created a European turboprop development center, after the US-Exim Bank closure in June, investing over $400 million and creating 500 to 1,000 jobs. The engine was announced on 16 November 2015 at the National Business Aviation Association's annual tradeshow. The gearbox, power turbine and combustor will be made in Turin and the rotating components will be supplied from Warsaw, both locations belonging to Avio, acquired by GE in 2013, and the final assembly line should be at Walter Engines in Prague. It should be certified in 2020. It was designed by Avio Aero engineers, and for the power and gas generator turbine, and the high pressure compressor, by the Engineering Design Center in Warsaw, an alliance between GE Poland and the Warsaw Institute of Aviation. In October 2017, GE received 85% of the parts, on track to deliver the first test engine by the end of the year. At this time, the axial-centrifugal compressor vehicle - stator, rotor and cold- section assemblies - was tested in Munich to validate its efficiency, performance and operability. Testing After two years of development, it completed its first test run in Prague on December 22, 2017. After most of the component tested and the engine run, GE Aviation maintains its performance objectives and hope to exceed them. It will begin certification testing in 2018, validating the aerodynamics, mechanics, and aerothermal systems. It is expected to power the Cessna Denali first flight in late 2018 and will complete over 2000 hours of testing before the Denali enter service. GE Aviation Czech, the development, testing and production headquarters, has recruited around 180 employees, with another 80 expected in 2018 among 500 others for the complete facility at full production rate. It was developed over two years by 400 GE designers, engineers and materials experts in the Czech Republic, Italy, Germany, Poland, the U.S. and elsewhere. Six test cells will open, 10 test engines will be built and it will be flown later in 2018 on a flying testbed, certification tests over 2018-2019 include altitude, performance and high-vibration testing. In March 2018 the first sample ran nearly 40 hours before several years of health monitoring review. The next engine is assembled and instrumented for altitude trials and will be tested in Canada from summer 2018. From later in 2018, Cessna will receive three engines to prepare the first-quarter 2019 Denali maiden flight. Its development is 30% faster than previous new GE projects as the development program has 10 engines, plus several rebuilds. Over the next two years, 33 engine tests overall will happen including 17 certification tests. The certification do not require a flying testbed but a modified King Air 350 may be used for flight safety clearance early in 2019, before Denali flight tests. At the end of May 2018, 60 hours of testing were completed including at full power while second engine assembly was nearly complete for a summer first run, component certification was imminent and should be followed by whole-engine certification testing, starting with ingestion and altitude tests. By July 2018, the first engine ran over 100 hours while a second engine is running in Prague before being sent to Canada later in the year for altitude testing, performance is on target or better than predicted. By May 2019, test engines ran up to 41,000ft in an altitude chamber and over 1,000 h, simulating three years of operations, while the FADEC ran 300 h in the Denali iron bird. By October 2019, over 1,000 engine cycles logged 1,600h of tests: 1,200h in test cells and 400h in compressor rigs. Altitude, endurance, vibration, durability and ingestion testing were complete, as integrated propeller controls tests and high-pressure compressor and gas generator turbine overspeed tests. New icing tests requirements pushed back the first engine delivery to 2020, and Cessna Denali first flight even further. Five engines were assembled by then, and two other should be completed before 2019 ends. First flight test aboard a King Air was delayed until spring 2020 and certification for autumn 2021, after a 18-month campaign, due to new FAA testing requirements, including icing tests. Market The ATP is intended to cover the market between the H80 and CT7. It will compete with the Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6, produced at 51,000 units and leading the small turboprop market for 50 years, adding to the sub-850 horsepower General Electric H80. It has been selected to power the new Cessna Denali single engine turboprop aircraft, seating up to 12 passengers at over 280 knots on 1,500 nautical miles. GE plans to invest up to $1 billion in the project, including $400 million for a manufacturing center in Europe. Design The 1,300 shp Advanced Turboprop could be extended in an 850 to 1,600 shp range. Its 16:1 overall pressure ratio allow a 20% lower fuel burn and 10% higher cruise power than same size class competition with a 4000‚Äì6000 hour mean time between overhauls (MTBO). The compressor is derived from the General Electric T700 with four axial stages and a single centrifugal stage, with the same 3D aerodynamics design used in the GE9X. The engine include variable stator vanes (VSVs) and 3D printed parts. The reverse-flow single-annular combustor resembles the GE-Honda HF120 design. The two-stage single-crystal high pressure turbine will be the first in this class of engines to be fully cooled. The three-stage low-pressure turbine is contra- rotating. A FADEC integrated propulsion control system will govern both engine and propeller pitch as an entire system. Twelve 3D-printed parts replaces 855 parts: frames, combustor liners, sumps, exhaust case, bearing housings, stationary components in the flowpath, and heat exchangers. Overall weight is reduced by 5% and brake specific fuel consumption is improved by 1%. 3D printing is not used for rotating components such as blades, discs and rotors. 35% of the engine will be printed at GE, reducing the serialized part count to 35. They are printed from a titanium alloy. The time between overhauls is 4,000 hours, 33% more than its leading competitor. It is the first turboprop in its class with two stages of variable stator vanes. It will feature a composite, five-bladed propeller system from McCauley, a subsidiary of Textron. Turboprops now have to be certificated for high-altitude ice crystal icing: a compressor blisk has to survive an impact from an ice ball. This would require a 2 lb (1.13kg) heavier first stage and would hamper the engine aerodynamics. GE proposed channelling to the engine inlet hot oil from an accessory gearbox sump to avoid growing ice and will test this in a Canadian cold weather facility in summer 2018. Cooled turbines allow over higher operating temperatures. Its FADEC, VSVs and a three-stage counter-rotating turbine generates 10% higher cruise power, maintaining peak efficiency at off- design conditions for better lapse rate and altitude power. The one-piece sump replaces 45 conventional parts and will be printed in just four days down from 14 initially.

Biography  Lu was born in Changyi County, Shandong Province. He joined the Communist Party of China in 1925, and participated in the Northern Expedition under the command of Feng Yuxiang. In 1929, he engaged in intelligence work on behalf of the Communist Party of China in Shanghai. After the September 18 Incident, he went to Xi'an to work for Yang Hucheng. In March 1932, he went to De'an County, Jiangxi Province where he was appointed as chief of staff to Kuomintang administrator Mo Xiong, who was sympathetic to the communists. In October 1934, Lu and other communists in Mo's staff provided Zhou Enlai with intelligence on the Kuomintang's Iron Bucket Plan against the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army. Zhou only shared the information with Bo Gu and Otto Braun. The intelligence saved the communists from being wiped out by Chiang Kai-shek's National Revolutionary Army in Jiangxi and enabled the Long March, which ended in October 1935 at Bao'an (Shaanxi). In February 1936, Lu went to Guizhou Province to become general services section chief and commissioner of the Communist Party of China. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, he was chief of staff to the New Fourth Army in northern Jiangsu Province. After the victory over the Japanese and resumption of the Chinese Civil War in 1946, Lu returned to Shanghai to resume intelligence work for the eventual communist conquest of the city. Lu, however, did not live to see Shanghai come under communist control or the creation of the People's Republic of China. On March 2, 1947, he was discovered, arrested and secretly imprisoned by the Nationalist authorities in Shanghai. He was executed toward the end of the following year.

It is directly subject to the Chaldean Catholic Patriarch of Babylon (actually in Baghdad, Iraq), not part of any ecclesiastical province. Its cathedral episcopal see is the St. Joseph's Cathedral, in Aleppo, the largest city in Syria. The territory is divided into 14 parishes.  History  A colony of Chaldean Christians was certainly present in Aleppo in the early 16th century, most probably from the city of Diyarbakƒ±r in Upper Mesopotamia. In 1723 the Chaldean patriarch Joseph III obtained from the Ottoman government a firman who recognized his jurisdiction over the Chaldean faithful of the city. However, the number of the Chaldean faithful remained always reduced; at the beginning of the twentieth century the community included only 250 people. In 1901, however, Pope Leo XIII authorized the institution of a patriarchal vicariate, directly dependent on the patriarch. The eparchy was erected on July 3, 1957 with the bull Almost pastor[Bolla Quasi pastor, AAS 50 (1958), p. 249] of Pope Pius XII, with which the pontiff suppressed the Chaldean Catholic Eparchy of Gazireh of the Chaldeans and established the new ecclesiastical circumscription.

It was founded in 1926 by a group of yachtsmen for the purpose of providing training and lectures over the winter months. The club operates from its riverside clubhouse at Bell Wharf on the River Thames, and is the only one operating from within the City of London. The Little Ship Club shares its current space with the City Livery Club since 2010City Livery Club history Wiki and CLC website http://www.cityliveryclub.com/. Joint dinners and other events are sponsored on occasion to promote interest and friendship between the two Club tenants at the Bell Wharf Lane location. History The club's inaugural meeting was at The Ship restaurant in London on 5 November 1926. Notable founder members included Claud Worth, Maurice Griffiths, and Higley Halliday. The training function of the club was so successful that, by 1936, they were training members of the Royal Naval Supplementary Volunteer Reserve Force (RNSVR). As a result, the First Sea Lord invited the club to apply for a defaced blue ensign. This is the only known instance of such an invitation being made. The close link with the RNSVR led to Little Ship Club members taking part in the World War II evacuation of Dunkirk in which the military commandeered hundreds of private \\"little\\" ships to bring troops from land to larger navy vessels that could not pull in close to shore. The club still includes what is possibly one of the original Dunkirk Little Ships, Sheemaun. Two defaced blue ensigns that were recovered from the beach at Dunkirk are displayed at the club. The club moved to the Old Ship tavern in 1928, and from there to Beaver Hall in 1932, as member numbers expanded.E.G. Martin and John Irving, Cruising and Ocean Racing p. 565, 1945 Seeley, Service & Co. Ltd. In 1962, the club moved to Bell Wharf Lane. Sir Robin Knox-Johnston, the first yachtsman to complete a non-stop single-handed circumnavigation, became club President in 1995. There are also two Honorary Life Vice-Presidents: Dr Jean Plancke, Commander of the Legion of Honour, and Norman Hummerstone MBE. Norman Hummerstone was honoured with an MBE in 2001 for his work with the Little Ship Club and was awarded an RYA Lifetime Commitment award by Princess Anne in 2007. In early 2017, it was announced that, following the retiral of Sir Robin Knox-Johnston, Mike Golding would take on the role of Club President. The 2017 Commodore is Anne Billard. Training The Little Ship Club is an official RYA training centre. They offer shorebased RYA courses from their London premises including Day Skipper Theory and Yachtmaster Theory. Cruising The club has two cruising bases, one on the East Coast of England, and one on the South Coast, centred around the Solent. Both cruising centres have participated in the Calais Rally each year on the weekend of the Spring Bank Holiday since 1929,E.G. Martin and John Irving, Cruising and Ocean Racing p. 566, 1945 Seeley, Service & Co. Ltd. except when not possible during wartime. The rally is attended by HMS Puncher in recognition of the club's relationship with the University Royal Naval Unit in London. The club holds a biannual joint rally with The Corinthians club, a reciprocal club based in the USA that was modeled along the same lines as the Little Ship Club. It is held alternately in the US and in the UK, or nearby cruising grounds.Yachting Monthly Magazine, Oct 2004, Dick Durham Racing The club organises an informal Fast Cruise series over the winter months around the Solent. These run monthly from October until March. They do not follow full racing rules, but are a timed cruise with a strong social element. They are also joint organisers, with Erith Yacht Club, of the Thames Trafalgar Race. This is a two-leg event from Greenwich to Erith, with a return the next day. It is generally held in October close to Trafalgar Day. The Knox-Johnston Cup, named for Sir Robin Knox-Johnston, is awarded to the highest placed yacht club.

He was appointed governor of Hubei Province in 1936, but was assassinated the same year. Career Yang was born in Gaozhou Guangdong Province during the Qing dynasty. He was a xiucai (Imperial examination student member). After finishing his education in Beijing, Yang edited a newspaper in Guangzhou called Guangnan. He joined the Kuomintang in 1912, after the Xinhai Revolution toppled the Qing empire and created the Republic of China. In 1913, he attended the 1st party congress of the Kuomintang as a delegate. In 1914, after Yuan Shikai dissolved China's parliament and expelled its Kuomintang members, Yang and Huang Xing published a magazine in Shanghai voicing their opposition to Yuan's ambitions to become emperor. From 1917 until 1920, Yang was finance minister of the government of the Constitutional Protection Movement, centered in Guangdong Province. In June 1922, Yang went to Beijing to seek reconciliation between the Kuomintang and the Beiyang government, but after Cao Kun's seizure of the presidency in 1923, he ended those efforts in opposition to Cao. After a conference in 1925, Yang was confirmed as deputy party secretary of the finance ministry. In 1927, with the formation of the Nationalist Government in Nanjing under Chiang Kai- shek, he formed the Political Science Clique with Zhang Qun, Wang Ch'ung-hui and Chang Kia-ngau. In 1931, he received an appointment as secretary of military affairs. In 1933, he went to Nanchang to oversee its military affairs. In 1934, he was given full authority over the military affairs of Henan, Anhui and Hubei Provinces, headquartered in Wuchang. He oversaw the campaigns against the forces of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army present in those provinces. In early 1936, he was made governor of Hubei and assassinated later that year in Hankou. The assassin was sponsored by a political rival in the CC Clique.

The couple joined the Religious Society of Friends in about 1652, during a mission to Furness by George Fox. Thomas was among 27 Friends from Furness and elsewhere in Lancashire who were prosecuted several times for interrupting priests and addressing their congregations.

Altogether, he stated in A Relation..., he spent eleven years in prison.

The Curwens also visited the nearby island of Nevis, where vestiges of Quakerism were reported in 1817 among slaves long after all white Quakers had left. The group, known as Naohites, used the Quaker term \\"first-day\\" for Sunday, rejected payment for preachers, forbade gaudy dress, debt, stealing, lying and swearing, and emphasized that the Spirit puts into people's hearts what they should do.Transatlantic Literature in the Long Eighteenth Century, ed.

It is owned and managed by Cambridge City Council. The site is a small area of woodland surrounded by agricultural land. Multiple springs issue from the base of a chalk hill, and feed Hobson's Conduit, the watercourse that was built between 1610 and 1614 by Thomas Hobson and other benefactors to bring fresh water into the city of Cambridge. There are four main springheads linked by stream channels, as well as innumerable minor fissures, that issue water at a constant 10.2 ¬∞C.Nine Wells Local Nature Reserve History Location of King's Ditch overlaid on a modern map In 1265 a defensive channel known as 'the king's ditch' was excavated around the city of Cambridge. By the early 17th century this ditch had become an open sewer. In 1574 Andrew Perne DD, Master of Peterhouse, thought of constructing a channel to bring water to the ditch. Hobson's Conduit, constructed from 1610, used the natural springs at Nine Wells to create a flow of water to the city and flush the kings ditch. This was not only successful in sanitising the city but it became the principal water supply for Cambridge for over 250 years. Water continues to flow into the city and waters the lake in the Botanic Gardens. Plant species Sweet violets at Nine Wells, April 2016The dominant trees here are beech which were originally planted for firewood but have a detrimental effect on the watercourses: an acidic acid leaf fall in autumn is causing heavy silting and a change in oxygen levels. The hedgerow that encloses the reserve was planted following the Enclosures Act of 1834 and comprises native species like hawthorn, spindle and field maple. A survey determined that 108 plant species grow here and the area contains numerous mature ash trees as well as blackthorn. Scented sweet violets (Viola odorata) and bluebells bloom there early in the year, and later there are cowslips and deadly nightshade. Aquatic wildlife It was created a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest because a range of relic aquatic invertebrates bred here. The flatworms Planaria cornuta and P. alpina were found here and had survived from the last glacial period. Another relic species was a trichopteran (caddisfly), Agapetus fuscipes.correspondence with Dr. Nigel Russell, Lead Conservation Adviser, Cambridgeshire Land Management Team, Natural England, Nov 2015 However the drought of 1976 together with increased water abstraction caused some extinctions and Nine Wells lost its SSSI status. Efforts are being made to recreate conditions favourable to re-establishing a richer invertebrate fauna again, however there is a great deal of new building going on in the area so this special little habitat patch is potentially under threat. According to the information boards within the reserve, active management is needed to keep the streams suitable for bullhead fish to thrive and this is important as they provide food for kingfishers. Falling beech leaves need to be cleared from the streams to stop the water from becoming too acidic. Terrestrial Species These woods are home to species including chaffinch, robin, yellowhammer, greenfinch, blackbird and, during the summer, chiffchaff. The site is an important refuge for birds, with sparrowhawk (Accipitier nisus), green woodpecker (Picus viridis), long-tailed tit (Aegithalos caudatus), bullfinch (Pyrrhula pyrrhula) and redwing (Turdus iliacus) recorded as well as a good variety of small species. This is also a good site for butterflies including peacocks and brimstones (Gonepteryx)\\". Monument Within the Reserve there is a monument to Hobson's Conduit which was erected in 1861 by public subscription and records the benefactors to the water course and conduit as: * Thomas Chaplin, Lord of the Manor of Trumpington Delapole, 1610 * Stephen Perse, fellow of Gonville and Caius, 1615 * Thomas Hobson, carrier, 1630 * Edward Potto, alderman of Cambridge, 1632, and * Joseph Merrill, alderman of Cambridge, 1806 Location It is south of Addenbrooke's Hospital and east of the railway line and the genome cycle track (), near the village of Great Shelford.

Built in 1836, it is one of a few well- preserved early town halls in Maine that served a strictly civic purpose. It was used by the town for its town meetings until 1952, and has been restored to an early 20th-century appearance. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014. Description and history The Dixmont Town House is located not far from the geographic center of Dixmont, on south side of Western Avenue (Maine State Route 9/United States Route 202), the town's major east-west thoroughfare. It is a small single-story wood frame structure, measuring about . It has a gabled roof, wooden clapboard siding, and a granite foundation. It is oriented with the roof ridge roughly parallel to the road, with the street facing facade composed of two sash windows flanking a central batten door. The main entrance, also a batten door, is on the eastern facade, framed by simple trim elements, as are the windows. The building interior consists of a single chamber, with wide wainscoting below original plaster walls, and original wide pine floors. The town house is generally given a construction date of 1836, when the property was deeded to the town. Its styling and workmanship are suggestive of an earlier construction date, but the town is known to have met in other buildings prior to 1820. It is one of the oldest surviving town houses in the state, built for strictly secular civic uses, in the state; only the Turner Town House (1831) is known to be older. The building underwent a major restoration under the auspices of the local historical society between 2008 and 2013, restoring it to verny near its early 20th-century appearance.

Born in York, Shaftoe moved with his family to Kingston-upon-Hull when he was eleven, leaving school and becoming an apprentice basket maker. He joined the Basket Makers' trade union in 1862, and took part in a strike two years later, but lost his job as a result, and moved to Bradford to find work. There, he played a prominent part in a six-month long strike, and was then elected as the local secretary of the Yorkshire Skep and Basket Makers' Union.Keith Laybourn and John Saville, Dictionary of Labour Biography, vol.III, pp.158-160 Shaftoe immediately began campaigning for the union to expand its remit and provide benefits for members who were unable to work due to illness, and for families of deceased members. This was agreed, and in 1868 he was appointed as the union's general secretary. He led two strikes, both successful, resulting in increases in wages and a maximum nine- hour day. In 1872, Bradford Trades Council was refounded, and Shaftoe was elected as its first president. He was seriously injured in 1875, and took two years out of union activism, but returned, then in 1882, instead became secretary of the trades council. He also regularly attended the Trades Union Congress (TUC), and was elected as President of the TUC when it met in Bradford in 1888. From 1891 until 1894, Shaftoe served on Bradford Town Council as a Liberal-Labour member, backed by the Bradford Labour Union. During this time, he was also prominent in the Labour Electoral Association, and these roles brought him into conflict with the Bradford Labour Union, who wanted labour candidates to be entirely independent of the Liberal Party. In 1893, he was defeated for his trades council post by a member of the new Independent Labour Party. Despite bad feelings, Shaftoe remained involved with the labour movement in Bradford, and also became the first working man in the West Riding of Yorkshire to become a magistrate. By 1905, Shaftoe was suffering poor health and struggling for an income. The trades council persuaded the town council to pay him a small pension until his death in 1911.

Probably born in Weston-super-Mare, Sheppard became an orphan when he was nine, and was fostered in Langford, undertaking an apprenticeship as a bootmaker. Once qualified, he moved to Bristol to find work, and became active in the National Union of Operative Boot and Shoe Riveters and Finishers. By 1884, he became the union's Bristol representative, and in 1893, he was elected as president of Bristol Trades Council.Bob Whitfield, Dictionary of Labour Biography, vol.III, pp.160-162 In 1887, Sheppard joined the Social Democratic Federation, and he also served as honorary secretary of the Bristol Socialist Society. In 1893, he was elected to Bristol City Council as an independent labour representative for St Pauls, and was re-elected in 1904, serving until his death. He subsequently left the SDF and became prominent in the local Labour Party, standing unsuccessfully for Bristol East at the January 1910 general election. He supported British involvement in World War I, and worked with Ben Tillett to encourage trade unionist to enlist in the British Army. Sheppard stood down from his trade union posts in 1913 and 1914, became the first Labour Lord Mayor of Bristol in 1917, and then spent much of his time as secretary of the Shirehampton Housing Utility Company, which constructed cheap but high-quality housing for workers. He was selected to stand as a Coalition Labour candidate in Bristol Central at the 1918 general election, but Ernest Bevin led a campaign to remove him, as Labour's official policy was not to participate in the coalition, and Bevin instead stood. Sheppard was awarded the OBE in 1918 and CBE in the 1930 New Year Honours. He remained a Labour Party councillor and reconciled with Bevin; despite his earlier support for a coalition, he did not join the National Labour Organisation split. He served on the tribunal for conscientious objectors during World War II and remained politically active until shortly before his death, aged 93.

Founded in Hyde Park in direct response to the Civil Rights Movement in 1956, CCC has grown from one choir into a vast network of in-school and after- school programs serving nearly 5,000 students across the city of Chicago. CCC has impacted the lives of more than 50,000 diverse youth throughout its 64-year history. Since its founding, CCC has focused on building programs that reflect the racial and economic diversity of Chicago. Eighty percent of youth served are from low-to-moderate income homes, with over 4,000 students annually participating completely free of charge. All singers in CCC programs receive some level of subsidy. High school seniors enrolled in CCC have a 100% graduation rate, becoming global ambassadors who carry on CCC‚Äôs core values in a wide array of professional fields. History In 1956 during the Civil Rights Movement, the late Rev. Christopher Moore founded the multiracial, multicultural Chicago Children's Choir at Hyde Park's First Unitarian Church of Chicago. He believed that youth from diverse backgrounds could better understand each other - and themselves - by learning to make beautiful music together. Today, the choir is fully independent and serves all of Chicago from its home in the Chicago Cultural Center. Christopher Moore's vision of a choir combining high artistic standards with a social purpose continues to define the choir's mission. Distinguished singers included David Edmonds, who performed with the choir from 1970 to 1977. He sang classical, folk and spiritual pieces as lead soloist in numerous concerts, both in Chicago and on national tours. He can be heard on the choir's 1972 album Chicago Children's Choir Sings at Orchestra Hall. Edmonds also performed with the Joffrey Ballet, the Rockefeller Chapel Orchestra and Chorus, and the Bretton Woods Boy Singers.

Located on the Belaya River in the natural reserve Shulgan-Tash, the cave is best known for the 16,000 years old Upper Paleolithic rock paintings and drawings.

Summer was short, while winter months were very long and cold and the landscape was Tundra. Humans sought shelter in clefts and caves among the rocks. The entrance to the cave is situated on the southern slope of the Sarykuskan () mountain. It forms a huge arch of height. To the left of the entrance to the cave is a lake from which the river Shul'gan () originates. Inside the cave flows the underground Shul'gan () river, that created the cave. This three-storey cave system is about long, with a vertical amplitude of including siphon underwater cavities, large halls, galleries, underground lakes and the river The mouth of the Shulgantash cave called now the Portal. Deep in the Portal the Shulgan stream comes up through the earth forming a pool named Blue Lake. The lake is bottomless. Below 33 Meters in depth it joins a gigantic underground water cavity. A passageway leads from the Portal to the succession of the ground level halls. First comes the Main gallery, then the Stalagmite hall. Moving on the same northward direction one can get into Dome hall and the Hall of the Signs and , finally, to the furthermost hall, the Hall of Chaos. The halls differ in size and shape: the Main gallery and the Hall of Chaos are oblong. The Stalagmite and the Dome halls are circular, whereas the Hall of the Signs is rectangular. Their length reaches 90, width 20-30 and the height 7-20 metres. The halls are connected by tunnels of various length and shape, somewhere occur clumply blockages. The air from the outside reaches the Main gallery and slightly felt the Stalagmitic hall too/ But in the Dome hall and onwards both in winter and in summer the air condition is constant. The father we advance the stalactites and stalagmites we meet/ The walls too are covered with calcite sinter which sometimes is half a metre deep. Some of the calcite stones are intricately shaped. Vestigial traces of the primitive man's life can be found already in the halls of the halls of the ground level. On the walls of the Middle Dome hall one can plainly discern spots of spread read paint as well as some ornament of geometrical figures- the signs. In the neighbouring Hall of the Signs the number of such figures considerable increase. In the corner of the Hall of Chaos. In the soil layer, the archaeologist Shchelinsky discovered remnants of a fire and vestigial traces of ancient people\`s vital activity. Scheme of the first floor of the cave Underground lake in the cave The Hall of Chaos may actually be called the museum of the ground level part of the cave. On its walls one can see a two-coloured picture of long- haired horses, beside them a trapezium like geometrical figure and a little further a group of geometrical signs. The picture of an anthropoid creature, the only one in Shulgantash cave, Is also to be found in this hall. For many centuries all the drawings had been covered with a semi-transparent calcite crust. The expedition headed by the prominent archaeologist O.N.Bader cleaned the pictures of the horses in 1976. In order to ascend to the upper tier of the cave one has to return to the Stalagite hall where there is a hole in the roof leading upwards. To connect the floor with the hole a steel ladder has been installed which is followed by a stepping slope of earth, where another ladder , which is 16 meters long, takes visitors to the upper tier. Having climbed the ladder, visitors find themselves in a long and high hall which is called the First gallery. It opens succession of the upper tier halls. Moving further northwards one has to cross the small Antechamber hall in order to get into the most famous hall of the Shulgantash- the Hall of the Drawings. The cave itinerary in the northern direction can be tracted yet father from here. There are 14 more large and small halls to be visited: the Second gallery, the Acoustice hall, the Oval hall, the hall Temple, the Upper and Diamond halls, the hall of Upper Lake (with a large lake in it), the Rainbow and the Cristal halls, the Hall of the Mountain King, the gallery Hell, the Hall of the Abyss, the Transsyphon hall and the Far hall. The way to the remote halls is rather complicated with many dangerous sections and pools blocking the trail. In the Transsyphon hall one can see the River Shulgan in its underground flow. Beyond the Far hall there is a cavity filled with water,a siphon. The speleologist and scuba diver Vladimir Kiselyov traveled once as far as 317 meters northwards inside the siphon and had to return, having found no end to it. The wonder of the Crystal hall is the silvery fringe of calcite icicles hanging from the ceiling. Among the sublime decorations of the cave are \\"milky rivers\\" composed of tiny calcite crystals, fragile and crisp, which haven\`t become solid yet. The cave brooks sometimes make small funnels in the halls on the floor where may appear grains of cave pearl whereas on the walls there is a crust of marble onyx, in some places half a metre deep. Marble onyx is a type of marble found only in caves.  The Hall of the Drawings  The most ancient drawings are in the upper tier. They were painted in the Late Paleolithic era., when Cro-Magnons lived on the planet. On the lower tier of the Kapova cave are later images of the end of the ice age. Their size varies between 44 and 112 centimeters.

He discovered drawings of ancient people on the walls of the Shulgantash (Kapova) cave. Alexander Ryumin, having gone down underground in search of bats, found colorful wall pictures of various animals - horses, rhinos and mammoths . This became a real world sensation - scientists of that time believed that drawings of fossil animals of the Paleolithic era were characteristic only of Western Europe - such an ancient cave painting is found in the world only in France and Spain. From that moment on, the Kapova cave acquired the status of an important historical and cultural complex, which is unrivaled in Eastern Europe. The best composition is on the right half of eastern wall. In the centre of the composition, within the reach of the ancient painter\`s hand, is drawing of an animal, ¬´ Ryumin\`s horse¬ª , the first picture of all those discovered in the Shulgantash cave. Next are the pictures of several mammoths and a rhinoceros. All the animals are shown walking from right to left with one small mammoth standing or going in the opposite direction. On the opposite wall there are a bison or a bull and mammoths with a calf. In this hall one can also see the picture of a trapezium with strange lines and signs inside the figure and unusual ears at the top. Such geometrical signs are repeatedly occur in the drawings of the Shulgantash (Capova cave). The Ignatievka Cave is located some from the Kapova cave.  Discovery, excavation  Local people were afraid to visit the cave. The first written information on the Shulgantash cave appeared in January 1760. The first corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, P.I. Rychkov, visited the Voznessensky factory in Bashkiria. Here he was told about the cave, located 12 km from the factory.

In the middle and later half of the 19th century the Shulgantash cave was studied by a number of travelers and explorers (by geologists of the South Ural N.G. Myaglitsky and A.I. Antipov in 1858). The local forester Fyodor Simon organized sometimes excursions to the cave. In 1896, the lower floor of the cave was examined by members of the Orenburg branch of the Russian Geographical Society D. Sokolov, I. Zanevsky and F. Simon, who shot a plan of the entrance part of the lower floor and compiled a protocol for its inspection and measurement. Researchers noted that the description of P.I. Rychkova is in full agreement \\"with the actual state of the cave: in all the indicated places everything that he noted was found\\". In 1923 the geologist and scientist G.V.Vakhrushev explored the cave up to Upper Lake. He made its rough sketchy map and issued a small book \\"The Enigmas of Kapova Cave\\". There was beginning of research work. In 1931 G.V. Vakhrushev came to the cave again, clarified the data about the cave, described the surroundings of the cave. He also wrote about various legends of the Shulgan- Tash cave. In 1960 the group of Moscow archaeologists headed by O.N.Bader started working in the cave–ë–∞–¥–µ—Ä –û. –ù. –ö–∞–ø–æ–≤–∞—è –ø–µ—â–µ—Ä–∞-La caverne Kapovaia: –ü–∞–ª–µ–æ–ª–∏—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∞—è –∂–∏–≤–æ–ø–∏—Å—å –ú., 1965. –∏ –í. –ï. –©–µ–ª–∏–Ω—Å–∫–∏–π. –û—Ñ–∏—Ü–∏–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–π —Å–∞–π—Ç –≥–æ—Å—É–¥–∞—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–≥–æ –ø—Ä–∏—Ä–æ–¥–Ω–æ–≥–æ –∑–∞–ø–æ–≤–µ–¥–Ω–∏–∫–∞ ¬´–®—É–ª—å–≥–∞–Ω-–¢–∞—à¬ª Over his entire work, he has opened more than 30 drawings, including mammoths, horses, rhinos, bison and geometric shapes. The drawings were cleaned from the calcite crust and mud, photographed and thoroughly examined. They were supposed to date back to late Paleolithic period (25-10 thousand years B.C.). The main result of long research was his book ‚ÄúKapova cave. Paleolithic painting \\"published in 1965. Bader believed that all the drawings represent a single complex and are relatively simultaneous. During this period, the study of the Shulgan-Tash cave itself was carried out by employees of Bashkir State University, under the direction of E.D. Bogdanovich and I.I. Kudryasheva. They compiled a real map of the cave. The first microclimatic observations were carried out, distant inaccessible areas were examined. After the death of Otto Bader in 1979, research in the cave has stopped. There were problems with saving drawings. It was decided to completely close the cave. Work in the cave was resumed only in 1982 by Leningrad archaeologist V.E. Shchelinsky. At that time, he led a comprehensive Paleolithic expedition that conducted archaeological research in the Southern Urals annually. When were the drawings applied to the walls of the cave? V.E. Shchelinsky managed to answer this question. He discovered under the ancient drawings the remains of the parking of contemporaries of these drawings. He believed that they belong to the Paleolithic era. Also V.E. Schelinsky believes that a significant part of the cave's drawings are combined into compositions reflecting the mythological representations of ancient people. For the first time it was able to identify a well-defined cultural layer of the Upper Paleolithic era, dated by the time about XIV thousand BC Traced focal spots indicate the use of open fire by the ancient inhabitants. In addition, a clay fat lamp, stone, mostly flint tools, pieces of ocher, jewelry in the form of beads and pendants made of stone and small shells of fossil mollusks, bones of animals of the ice age - mammoth, cave bear, fox, hare, marmot were found , pikas, jerboa. Archaeologist V.N. Shirokov from Yekaterinburg believes that the Shulgan-Tash cave was a sanctuary. I. V. Kiselev worked in it for a comprehensive study of the Shulgan-Tash cave In 1991. He made dives on the underground river Shulgan. V.G. Kotov explored the cave and he believes that Kapova cave for the peoples of the Southern Urals was a cult center where rites of initiation and rebirth of nature were performed. V.G. Kotov as well as V.N. Shirokov believes that the rituals that were performed in the cave at that time were associated with initiation rituals. Yuri Sergeyevich Lyakhnitsky made a detailed and accurate map of the Shulgan-Tash cave massif. In 2002, he identified drawings - the ‚Äúpale mammoth‚Äù, next to him was a drawing of a man and the silhouette of another mammoth. Now the Shulgantash is considered to be one of the caves which have been studied well enough.  Bashkort legends and traditions  The heart of the South Urals with Lake Shulgan and the sources of legendary rivers Aghidel,Yaiyk, Hakmar and Nogosh is associated with the life and deeds of the immortal heroes of the eposes ¬´ Ural Batyr¬ª and ¬´–êkbuthat¬ª (Akbuzat) which belong to the world art treasures. For ancient Bashkorts the area was the centre of the earth, where celestial, natural and underwater worlds could interact and interpenetrate. Very much legends, interesting traditions and fairy tales are related to the cave Shulgan-Tash. The most striking thing is that the main actions in many ancient tales and other folklore works are tied to the Shulgan-Tash cave or the Shulgan lake as soon as possible. And it is no coincidence that both the cave and the lake in them carry the name of the owner of the underworld (underwater king) Shulgen. Shulgen is one of the major negative characters of many ancient eposes of bashkorts( eposes: \\"URAL-BATYR\\", \\"AKBUZAT\\", \\"KARA-YURGA\\", \\"AKHAK KOLA\\" and other); Heroes: Haoban in the epos \\"Akbuzat\\"; Kushak-batyr in the epos \\"KARA-YURGA\\"; Batyr Miney in the epic \\"Kungir Buga\\" and o. LAKE SHULGAN (SHULGEN) arose according to legend from the remnants of the Flood Sea, arranged by the Div (Giant) and Shulgen after being hit by the staff of the earth. About lake Shulgen, for example, in the epos \\"AKBUZAT\\" was said: \\"When the water padishah ( King) lost the battle, he found a bottomless pool and dived into this lake. The lake became known as SHULGEN. \\" In the epos ¬´Akbuzat¬ª and the epos ¬´Ural-batyr¬ª are described sacrifice of a human to lake Shulgan. A beautiful girl was presented to the padishah of the underwater (underground) world (Rychkov found a ¬´dry human head¬ª while visiting the cave in 1760). In many legends and traditions of bashkorts takes lake Shulgan a central place. So all events in the epos ¬´Arbuzat¬ª are developed exactly around this lake . On the surfage of the lake at full moon appears the girl Narcas in the image of the gold duck. A young hunter ( Haoban) reseives a gift from her ‚Äì the horse Akbuzat (Toolpar with wings ) and countless herds of livestock. The only condition for Haoban is at this the prohibition of turning around towards the lake after receipt of gifts. But afraid of the storm caused by the emergence from the lake Toolpar, Haoban looked around and all animals disappeared into the lake again. The action of the other legend ¬´Kungyr buga¬ª occurs by the lake Shulgan. In this lake Batyr (hero) Minei finds the missing daughter of the old man and old women. She was stolen by a water thief in this town ( the owner of the lake). Batyr descends into the underwater kingdom, cuts down all seven heads of the monster and takes the girls, people and cattle to the ground. The motives for horses and cattle living on the lake and their partial disappearance in this same lake are distributed in numerous legends and eposes of bashkorts. A legend about Yelkysykkan-kul lake, from which horses have come out, is wide in the Burzyan district. This legend (by M.V. Lossievsky) tells about the batyr Bishlak which met during the hunting in the surroundings of the lake Shulgan an amazing wanderer. The wanderer asked Bishlak to give him his dog. The wanderer offered a herd of horses for the dog. Byshlak was supposed to drive forward without looking back. But out of curiosity, he looked around and the halfway the herd returned to the lake. The hunter became a rich man and his descendants (tribe) from his time is called Bayulins (rich). From this herd came the breed of gray horses. And the lake got the name Yelkysykkan - lake where the horses went out. By the text of description this lake complies with the lake of karst origin near the Shulgan-Tash cave ( named the lake Shulgan). In folk traditions very often is the lake Shulgan the place of birth of miracle horse. So, in the version of the legend ‚ÄúAkhak Kola‚Äù, the appearance of the leader of the herd Akhak Kola is described as follows: \\"Shulgan came to the lake . But he managed to catch only the foal - the mare dived back into the lake, but this foal became lame (from here and her name: ¬´Akhak Kola¬ª ‚Äì the lame light yellow horse with a black tail). Legendes related to cave personalize an external force. The cave environment is more severe and incomprehensible than the nature usually environing us. Vladimir DAL who visited the Orenburg province as an official , collected works of oral culture, in particular and Bashkir folklor. He charakterzed Kapova cave according to bashkir's tailes and legends. There are genies , dives (–¥–∏–≤—ã, fantastic creatures ), a stone dog. It is wonderful that the dog is afraid of whips. If you hit it a hundred times with a whip, it will rain. According to P.I. Rychkov, Bashkirs (Bashkorts) usually hid here their famiIies and horses during wars and their uprisings . The cattle naturally stayed in the lower floor of the cave , and women , children and old men went upstairs. Food was always stored here.

Launched during the final weeks of the Second World War as Lyngdalsfjord and only completed in late 1949, the ship sailed in both Arctic and Antarctic waters for more than 53 years until shipwrecking off the coast of Norway in 1992. Description The vessel was built by Kaldnes Mekaniske Verksted in T√∏nsberg, Norway. She had yard number 122, and was long overall, with a beam of . Her length between perpendiculars was . Originally intended to be powered by a steam engine, the vessel, when completed, instead had a single 1,080 horsepower MAN 6-cylinder diesel engine.Hansen 1996, pp. 93‚Äì94 In addition to the main engine, Norsel had a 35-horsepower auxiliary engine.Hansen 1996, p. 103 The ship was rebuilt at Troms√∏ Shipyard in 1966, having her superstructure and internal fittings replaced. Four years later, in 1970, the ship's engine was replaced with a 1,200 horsepower engine from Maschinenbau Kiel (MaK). In 1979, the ship's engine was replaced yet again, this time with a 3,000 horsepower MaK, making Norsel Norway's most powerful icebreaker. During the 1970s, Norsel was rebuilt as a shell trawler and purse seiner, while continuing in use as a sealer.Hansen 1996, p. 97 Further rebuilding of the ship took place in the 1980s at Kaarb√∏ Shipyard in Harstad, where Norsel was lengthened and equipped with a factory for the processing of shells.Hansen 1996, p. 98 History The vessel was launched as Lyngdalsfjord on 10 April 1945. Lyngdalsfjord was one of five icebreaking tugs ordered for the Kriegsmarine by the German occupiers of Norway in 1944. None of the five vessels were completed before the end of the Second World War.Hansen 1996, p. 91 The incomplete Lyngdalsfjord was bought in 1948 by the Troms√∏-based polar hunting company Nordfisk A/S, and towed to Flensburg in Germany for completion as a sealing and expedition ship.Hansen 1996, p. 93 The vessel was completed as Norsel in October 1949. She remained in the ownership of Nordfisk for the next 30 years. Although sold first in 1979 to Steinar Jakobsen, then in 1989 to Statens Fiskarbank, in 1990 to Mathisen Fiskeb√•trederi A/S and in 1991 to Arktisk Marin A/S, she retained the name Norsel and remained home ported in Troms√∏. Norsel participated in a number of Antarctic voyages in the mid twentieth century. The first of these was with the Norwegian‚ÄìBritish‚ÄìSwedish Antarctic Expedition in 1949‚Äì52, for which Norsel did three supply voyages to the Maudheim Station in Antarctica.Hansen 1996, p. 94 Amongst the equipment Norsel brought from Norway and Sweden to Maudheim was two disassembled aircraft belonging to the airline Wider√∏e.Hansen 1996, p. 104 The ship was rented by the British Falkland Islands Department for service with the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey in 1954‚Äì55, transporting goods to Graham Land in the British Antarctic Territory. Next, Norsel supported the French Antarctic expeditions of Paul-√âmile Victor from 1955 to 1961, completing seven voyages to Ad√©lie Land. Norsel on two occasions circumnavigated the world while operating in support of the French. In all, the ship journeyed 10 times to Antarctica in the years 1949‚Äì61.Hansen 1996, pp. 94‚Äì95, 115‚Äì125Hansen 1996, p. 114\\"Ken Blaiklock O.B.E.\\" by David Mountfort, Polar Post, Vol. 46, No. 4, December 2014, pp. 92‚Äì93. When not employed in the Antarctic, Norsel participated in sealing off Newfoundland, catching a total of around 95,000 animals in the course of 25 hunting seasons. In the 1950s the ship was hired by the mining company Store Norske Spitsbergen Kulkompani to serve as an icebreaker in the waters off Svalbard. The Norwegian-born Colonel Bernt Balchen of the United States Air Force hired the services of Norsel for two voyages as a survey vessel for the Military Sea Transportation Service in the waters off Eastern Greenland and Iceland in the 1955‚Äì56 season. The surveys were carried out in connection with an American expansion of airbases and missile systems in the Arctic. In the 1950s and 1960s, she also served as a support vessel for the Norwegian sealers in the West Ice, and carried tourists and researchers on cruises to Svalbard. Due to her extensive service in the Arctic and Antarctic regions, Norsel was affectionately nicknamed \\"Polarbussen\\" (\\"the Polar Bus\\").Hansen 1996, p. 95 Outside of her polar work, Norsel was chartered by the British Seismographic Service and the Norwegian Directorate of Fisheries for seismic work in the North Sea and the English Channel. In the period from 1961 to 1963, Norsel was leased by the Norwegian Coast Guard, manned by naval personnel and armed with cannon for fishery protection duties. In the latter years of her service life, Norsel supported the Norwegian shrimp trawler fleet off Svalbard as a refuelling and service ship. By late August 1972, when the ship ran aground and was damaged, Norsel had been assigned the code letters LDQJ. Some nine years later, in September 1981, Norsel was damaged in an accidental collision with another vessel. Norsel ran aground off the coast of Helgeland, south-west of Br√∏nn√∏ysund, Norway () on 19 December 1992. Damaged beyond repair, the ship was delivered to a breaker's yard in Molde, Norway, in February 1993. Legacy In connection with the Norwegian‚ÄìBritish‚ÄìSwedish Antarctic Expedition, the iceport Norselbukta on the Quar Ice Shelf in Queen Maud Land was named after Norsel. Norsel Point, near Arthur Harbour in the British Antarctic Territory was named after the vessel following Norsels work on behalf of the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey in 1954‚Äì55. The road Norselvegen in Tromsdalen, Troms√∏ is also named after the ship. Norsel appeared on a f7.30 postage stamp of the French Antarctic Territory in 1981Stanley Gibbons stamp catalogue: Part 6 France. 6th edition.

The ECC consists of ten high schools: Anderson, Kings, Loveland, Milford, Turpin, Walnut Hills, West Clermont, Lebanon, Little Miami, and Winton Woods. Each of these schools compete in a variety of OHSA Division 1 and Division 2 Fall, Winter, and Spring sports. Lebanon, Little Miami, and Winton Woods joined in 2020-2021 school year. Withrow was a member school beginning with the 2014‚Äì2015 school year, but withdrew effective 2020‚Äì2021 school year to rejoin the Cincinnati Metropolitan Athletic Conference.  Fall sports  The ECC officially recognizes the following as Fall sports: boys and girls cross country, boys football, boys and girls soccer, girls volleyball, girls tennis, and boys and girls golf.  Football  Football is one of the more competitive sports in the ECC, with games taking place on Friday nights during football season, usually late August to early November, depending on how far the team advances in the playoffs. In 2012, the first season the ECC existed, Turpin dominated the conference with a 10‚Äì0 regular season record, and only losing their first game in the regional finals. Kings came second in the conference that year with a 6‚Äì4 overall record and a 4‚Äì2 conference record. In the 2013 season, Loveland was a clear powerhouse with their 15‚Äì0 overall record. Loveland won all of their 10 regular season games, then continued on to win the Ohio Division 2 State Championship. Loveland won 9 of 10 regular season games by a margin of at least 28 points. Kings was the conference runner-up, dropping their only conference game to Loveland. With the addition of Withrow to the conference in 2014, teams would now play 7 conference games in the regular season. Kings went 7‚Äì0 in the conference, moving on to the regional semifinals. Kings was able to win the rivalry game against Loveland, which was their only conference loss in the prior year. Loveland finished number 2 in the standings. The 2015 season ended with Turpin and Kings as the Leaders, both ending the regular season with a 9‚Äì1 record. In the post-season regional semi-finals, Kings defeated Turpin to advance in the playoffs.  Soccer  Soccer for the schools in the ECC has been one of the more successful competitive sports for both boys and girls, long before the ECC was formed. Turpin and Walnut Hills have had a history of success in their soccer programs, with Turpin winning 7 combined State Champion titles since the 1980s in boys and girls soccer. Turpin boys soccer is respected as one of the best teams in Ohio, having only lost 2 conference games since becoming a member of the ECC. The conference champion title for boys soccer has bounced back and forth between Walnut Hills and Turpin since the ECC formed in 2012. For girls soccer, the champion has shifted from Milford in 2012, to Loveland for the next two years, and most recently Turpin in the 2015 season.  Cross Country  Cross Country is another sport with both boys and girls teams that compete in the ECC. In cross country, schools will send their runners to meets, where they compete for the fastest completion of a 5-kilometer race (referred to as a 5K run). For boys cross country, all schools except Withrow have boys competing in varsity cross country. Casey Gallagher from Anderson set the ECC boys cross country record for the 5K run in 2012 at 15 minutes 56 seconds during the Trinity Meet. A close second was made Alaeldin Tirba from Turpin with a 15-minute 59.70-second run. Since then, nobody in the ECC has gotten under the 16:00 mark at an official 5K run. In the 2015 season, there were 192 runners in the ECC, with the fastest 5K run time going to Nick Stone (Anderson), with a 16:19 time. Girls Cross Country also competes in ECC 5K races, with Walnut Hills or Turpin winning the 5K run fastest time of all four seasons. The fastest girls 5K run in ECC history was set in the 2015 season with an 18:28 time by Samantha Bush (Turpin) at the Ross Meet.  Winter sports = Bowling  Bowling is another sport with boys and girls teams that compete in matches and the highest score wins. To determine who wins the ECC is standings. All teams in the ECC do bowling except Withrow. Girls bowling, 2012 Glen Este has been crowned champions in 2012 all the way to 2016. The 2016‚Äì17 champions of the ECC was clinched by Glen Este & Milford. In 2017‚Äì18 Milford clinched the ECC title. In 2018‚Äì19 West Clermont clinched the ECC title. In 2019‚Äì20, Loveland got its first title and captured the ECC title. For the 2020 girls statistics, Lexi Stewart, West Clermont was the leader with an average of 191.9. For the boys bowling, Glen Este has had 6 title wins, while Loveland has 1, Anderson has 2, and Kings has 1. For the 2019‚Äì20 season the boys' leader is Jarryd Forthuber, West Clermont with an average of 222.7.

Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are systems composed of physical entities regulated by computational elements (e.g. electronic controllers). System-level simulation is mainly characterized by: * a level of detail adapted to the practical simulation of large and complex cyber-physical systems (e.g. plants, aircraft, industrial facilities) * the possibility to use the simulation even if the system is not fully specified, i.e. simulation does not necessarily require a detailed knowledge of each part of the system. This makes it possible to use the simulation for conception or study phases, even at an early stage in this process These two characteristics have several implications in terms of modeling choices (see further). System-level simulation has some other characteristics, that it shares with CPS simulation in general: * SLS involves multi-physics models (thermo-fluidic, mechanical, electrical, etc.) * SLS is frequently cross- disciplinary, i.e. it is frequently the result of a collaboration between people with different expertises * SLS is generally built upon a hierarchy of models; an organized modeling is usually necessary to make the whole model envisagable; the conceptual decomposition of the system into sub-systems is related to the notion of system of systems SLS is mainly about computing the evolution over time of the physical quantities that characterize the system of interest, but other aspects can be added like failure modeling or requirement verification.  Motivations and benefit  The main motivation for SLS is the application of the holistic principle to computer simulation, which would state that simulating the system as a whole tells more than simulating parts of the system separately. Indeed, simulating the different parts of a complex system separately means neglecting all the possible effects of their mutual interactions. In many applications, these interactions cannot be ignored because of strong dependencies between the parts. For instance, many CPSs contain feedbacks that cannot be broken without modifying the system behavior. Feedbacks can be found in most modern industrial systems, which generally include one or more control systems. Another example of benefits from system level simulations is reflected in the high degree of accuracy (e.g. less than 1% cumulative validation error over 6 months of operation) of such simulations in the case of a solar thermal system. On the other hand, simply connecting existing simulation tools, each built specifically to simulate one of the system parts, is not possible for large systems since it would lead to unacceptable computation times. SLS aims at developing new tools and choosing relevant simplifications in order to be able to simulate the whole cyber- physical system. SLS has many benefits compared to detailed co-simulation of the system sub-parts. The results of a simulation at the system level are not as accurate as those of simulations at a finer level of detail but, with adapted simplifications, it is possible to simulate at an early stage, even when the system is not fully specified yet. Early bugs or design flaws can then be detected more easily. SLS is also useful as a common tool for cross- discipline experts, engineers and managers and can consequently enhance the cooperative efforts and communication. Improving the quality of exchanges reduces the risk of miscommunication or misconception between engineers and managers, which are known to be major sources of design errors in complex system engineering. More generally SLS must be contemplated for all applications whenever only the simulation of the whole system is meaningful, while the computation times are constrained. For instance, simulators for plant operators training must imitate the behavior of the whole plant while the simulated time must run faster than real time.  Modeling choices  Cyber-physical systems are hybrid systems, i.e. they exhibit a mix of discrete and continuous dynamics. The discrete dynamics mostly originates from digital sensing or computational sub-systems (e.g. controllers, computers, signal converters). The adopted models must consequently be capable of modeling such a hybrid behavior. It is common in SLS to use 0D ‚Äîsometimes 1D‚Äî equations to model physical phenomena with space variables, instead of 2D or 3D equations. The reason for such a choice is the size of the simulated systems, which is generally too large (i.e. too many elements and/or too large space extension) for the simulation to be computationally tractable. Another reason is that 3D models require the detailed geometry of each part to be modeled. This detailed knowledge might not be known to the modeler, especially if he/she works at an early step in the development process. The complexity of large CPSs make them difficult to describe and visualize. A representation that can be arranged so that its structure looks like the structure of the original system is a great help in terms of legibility and ease of comprehension. Therefore, acausal modeling is generally preferred to causal block-diagram modeling. Acausal modeling is also preferred because component models can be reused, contrary to models developed as block diagrams.  Domains of application  System-level simulation is used in various domains like: * building engineering for heating, ventilating and air conditioning simulation * automotive engineering * power plants (solar, combined-cycle) * MEMS * naval architecture * aircraft architecture * offshore oil production  Usages  In an early stage of the development cycle, SLS can be used for dimensioning or to test different designs. For instance, in automotive applications, \\"engineers use simulation to refine the specification before building a physical test vehicle\\". Engineers run simulations with this system-level model to verify performance against requirements and to optimize tunable parameters. System-level simulation is used to test controllers connected to the simulated system instead of the real one. If the controller is a hardware controller like an ECU, the method is called hardware-in-the-loop. If the controller is run as a computer program on an ordinary PC, the method is called software-in-the-loop. Software-in-the-loop is faster to deploy and releases the constraint of real time imposed by the use of a hardware controller. SLS is used to build plant models that can be simulated fast enough to be integrated in an operator training simulator or in an MPC controller. Systems with a faster dynamics can also be simulated, like a vehicle in a driving simulator. Another example of SLS use is to couple the system-level simulation to a CFD simulation. The system-level model provides the boundary conditions of the fluid domain in the CFD model.  Methods and tools  Specific languages are used to model specification and requirement modeling, like SysML or FORM-L. They are not meant to model the system physics but tools exist that can combine specification models and multi-physics models written in hybrid system modeling languages like Modelica. If a model is too complex or too large to be simulated in a reasonable time, mathematical techniques can be utilized to simplify the model. For instance, model order reduction gives an approximate model, which has a lower accuracy but can be computed in a shorter time. Reduced order models can be obtained from finite element models, and have been successfully used for system-level simulation of MEMS. SLS can benefit from parallel computing architectures. For instance, existing algorithms to generate code from high-level modeling languages can be adapted to multi-core processors like GPUs. Parallel co-simulation is another approach to enable numerical integration speed-ups. In this approach, the global system is partitioned into sub-systems. The subsystems are integrated independently of each other and are synchronized at discrete synchronization points. Data exchange between subsystems occurs only at the synchronization points. This results in a loose coupling between the sub-systems. Optimization can be used to identify unknown system parameters, i.e. to calibrate CPS model, matching the performance to actual system operation. In cases when exact physical equations governing the processes are unknown, approximate empirical equations can be derived, e.g. using multiple linear regression.  Possible future evolutions  If the simulation can be deployed on a supercomputing architecture, many of the modeling choices that are commonly adopted today (see above) might become obsolete. For instance, the future supercomputers might be able to \\"move beyond the loosely coupled, forward-simulation paradigm\\". In particular, \\"exascale computing will enable a more holistic treatment of complex problems\\". To exploit exascale computers, it will however be necessary to rethink the design of today's simulation algorithms. For embedded system applications, safety considerations will probably lead the evolution of SLS. For instance, unlike synchronous languages, the modeling languages currently used for SLS (see above) are not predictable and may exhibit unexpected behaviors. It is then not possible to use them in a safety- critical context. The languages should be rigorously formalized first. Some recent languages combine the syntax of synchronous languages for programming discrete components with the syntax of equation-based languages for writing ODEs.

Two police officers, Mark Ringgenberg and Dustin Schwarze, were involved in the shooting and were subsequently placed on paid administrative leave. The night after the shooting, Clark died at the Hennepin County Medical Center after being taken off life support. In response to the shooting, Black Lives Matter organized protests outside the Fourth Precinct police station that lasted for 18 days, as well as other protests and demonstrations in and around Minneapolis. Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman announced that cases concerning officer- involved shootings would no longer be put before grand juries. On March 30, 2016, Freeman announced that no charges would be filed against Ringgenberg and Schwarze. Jamar Clark Jamar Clark (May 3, 1991 - November 16, 2015) was adopted by Wilma and James Clark when he was four. His family stated that he had a close relationship with his biological and adoptive parents and his 14 siblings. At the time of the shooting, he was employed by Tim Hoag at Copeland Trucking and had hopes of attending college, although he never enrolled. Clark had previous encounters with law enforcement, beginning in 2010 when he received a felony conviction for first-degree aggravated robbery. The conviction resulted in a sentence of 41 months in prison, of which it is unclear how many Clark served. Clark faced a second conviction for terroristic threats after he threatened to burn down the apartment of an ex-girlfriend in March 2015, following a bitter breakup. According to Kyle Potter of the Associated Press, \\"He threw a brick through his ex-girlfriend's window and threatened to burn her apartment unit down -- leaving behind a trail of lighter fluid to prove it, according to court documents.\\" As of November 2015, he was on probation for this crime. Potter wrote that Clark's ex-girlfriend described him as \\"a nurturing, loving man who was drawn to her four children, giving them advice and helping them sell candy for school\\", but that she also said that their relationship soured in recent times, resulting in their breakup. A Domestic Abuse No Contact Order was issued for Clark, requiring him to stay away from the ex-girlfriend until 2020. Additionally, Clark was awaiting trial for a high-speed chase arrest from July 2015. Shooting Jamar Clark was attending the birthday party of Nekelia Sharp, who was hosting the event at her apartment on the 1600 block of Plymouth Avenue North in Minneapolis. Sharp and her husband engaged in a dispute and Clark's girlfriend grabbed Sharp, after which Sharp and Clark's girlfriend fought. Clark stepped in to pull his girlfriend away and, according to Sharp, Clark's girlfriend hit him. The pair left and soon, someone called for help and paramedics were called. Sharp let them into her apartment and they escorted Clark's girlfriend to the ambulance, which Clark approached after she had entered it. An onlooker reported that both the paramedics and police who had arrived at the scene asked Clark to step away from the ambulance and that police then stepped from their car, arrested Clark on the ground, and the EMS supervisor placed a knee on Clark's chest, after which point he was shot. County Attorney accounts say that Clark got into a confrontation with paramedics and then when police officers responded at 12:45a.m., a \\"struggle\\" ensued, Clark obtained the officer's gun, leading to the shooting by the other officer. Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said that Clark was resisting and was not handcuffed. In a statement on November 16, police chief Jane√© Harteau said that the Minneapolis Police Department's preliminary information was that Clark was not restrained with handcuffs when shot. The President of the Minneapolis Police Union Bob Kroll said that Clark was actively resisting arrest and tried to take the weapon of one of the officers, and that he was not handcuffed at the moment of the shooting. Clark's DNA was found on the handle of one of the officers' gun. Mike Freeman said there was no forensic evidence on Clark's arm indicating he was handcuffed at the time of shooting. In addition, he stated that 10 law enforcement and paramedic witnesses including the officers involved said he was not handcuffed.Jamar Clark shooting: no criminal charges for Minneapolis police officers, The guardian The US Justice Department declined to prosecute the officers, saying it found \\"insufficient evidence\\" for criminal civil rights charges. The DOJ's decision followed a separate investigation in March by Minnesota's Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA), which concluded that the officers acted in self-defense and would not face criminal charges for the killing. Schwarze shot Clark only after Ringgenberg scuffled with the young man, according to the BCA findings. Clark allegedly took control of the officer's gun and Ringgenberg told Schwarze to open fire. The department's internal investigation confirmed those findings. They \\"concluded the use of deadly force in the line of duty was necessary to protect an officer from apparent death or great bodily harm.\\" Other accounts have disputed the police's version of events. Nekelia Sharp said that the shooting occurred while Clark was handcuffed and not resisting. Teto Wilson, who visited a nearby club, said he saw Clark \\"perfectly still, laying on the ground\\" when he was shot. Keisha Steele, who lived near the area of the shooting, said she saw Clark's hands behind his back. Everett Spicer arrived at the scene after the shooting, and said he saw a motionless Clark handcuffed on the ground. Spicer said police removed the handcuffs from Clark as emergency medical services arrived to tend to him. Political reaction=Immediate response Mayor alt=A police officer in uniform, a mayor in a black blazer, and a police chief in a dark blue police jacket stand before a podium. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) issued a statement condemning the shooting and demanded an independent investigation. The Police Officers Federation of Minneapolis defended the officers' actions during the shooting, adding that they had no previous disciplinary issues and pointing out a preceding incident in which an Aitkin County sheriff's deputy was disarmed and killed with his own gun. Administrative leave Mark Ringgenberg and Dustin Schwarze, who have both been with the department for 13 months, both were subsequently placed on paid administrative leave while the investigation is ongoing. Local politics Minneapolis Mayor Betsy Hodges stated that she contacted the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice and the US Attorney for Minnesota in order to request an outside investigation in the \\"interest of transparency and community confidence.\\" Although Minnesota's Bureau of Criminal Apprehension had already begun an investigation, Hodges indicated that Minneapolis needed \\"all the tools we have available to us\\" to investigate the shooting. Protest reaction \\"Release the Tapes\\" - banner across the street from the Minneapolis Police Department's 4th Precinct during the fifth night of demonstrations following the police shooting death of Jamar Clark. Nekima Levy-Pounds speaks during a Black Lives Matter demonstration for Clark in Minneapolis. Black Lives Matter (BLM) activists and supporters protested for days outside the police precinct, protesting against information hiding, demanding for release of police dashcam and bodycam videos containing material evidence that can settle the truth of police accounts of the incident. Minneapolis City Council Member Lisa Bender shares her support for peaceful demonstrators on the fifth night of protests outside the Minneapolis Police Department's 4th Precinct Shooting of protesters On November 23, a group of four men, three wearing masks, were asked to leave the protest. The group was chased away from the demonstration by about a dozen protesters before one turned and opened fire at around 10:45 p.m. Five male protesters were shot, but none of them suffered life-threatening injuries. One of the injured protesters later said he heard the word \\"nigger\\" being used during the incident, although he did not state who exactly said it. Shots were also overheard the following night, though no injuries were reported. At 11:20 a.m. the next day, a 23-year-old white man was taken into custody in Bloomington. A 32-year-old Hispanic man was arrested in Minneapolis, but was later released after it was determined he was not at the scene of the shooting. At 2:30 p.m., two white men, ages 21 and 26, turned themselves in to police. Four men were charged in the shootings: Lawrence Scarsella, 23, with riot and five counts of assault (both in the second degree), and Daniel Thomas Macey, 26, Nathan Wayne Gustavsson, 21, and Joseph Martin Backman, 27, each with a charge of second-degree riot. Several of the men in custody are believed to have posted on 4chan's /pol/ and /k/ imageboards in connection with the shooting. Days before the shooting, the suspects had released a video of them using racial slurs while preparing to bring their weapons to a protest that night. As of March 14, 2016, attorneys for the men charged have motioned to dismiss the case based on self-defense. The motion says that the protesters wanted to \\"beat their asses\\" because they were white, KKK, or police. Interviews with two protesters indicate that the men charged were assaulted prior to being forced from the protest at which point they were followed for a number of blocks, before the men fired upon the group. The dismissal motion also indicates that there is video evidence saying that one of the alleged gunmen raised their hands in surrender before leaving and being assaulted afterwards. On January 24, 2017, current Burnsville Police Department and former Mankato PD officer Bret Levin, friend of Scarsella since high school, testified that he and Scarsella had exchanged \\"racially charged\\" texts, explicitly \\"negative about black people,\\" on multiple occasions. On April 26, 2017, Scarsella was sentenced to 15 years for the shooting. Charges against Macey were dismissed on February 27, 2017 as he was not with Scarsella at the time of the shooting, they were separated when pursued by protesters. On July 20, 2017, Gustavsson was sentenced to eight months in the workhouse, with credit for nearly two months of time served in jail after pleading guilty to felony second-degree riot and aiding an offender after the fact. Backman was sentenced to 90 days of house arrest for aiding an offender after the fact, the riot charge against him was dismissed for the same reason Macey's charges were stayed. Removal of protest camp alt=People mill about a fire and larger gatherings at night on a wintry street by a police building Protesters had camped outside of the 4th precinct for 18 days. At 4:00 a.m. on December 3, police arrived and handed out fliers stating protesters had ten minutes to leave. Later police began removing the encampments and most of the protesters left. Eight protesters who refused to leave were placed under arrest. Subsequent actions Black Lives Matters staged a December 23 protest of Clark's death at the Mall of America in Bloomington, a year after a similar protest in December 2014. The Mall sought to block the 2015 demonstrations, resulting in three of the protest's organizers being legally barred from entering the space. Protesters marched from the mall then took Metro Transit trains to the Terminal 2 station of the Minneapolis‚ÄìSaint Paul International Airport where they were blocked by police and Terminal 2 security checkpoints were closed. Other protesters drove to Terminal 1 and blocked incoming airport traffic on Minnesota State Highway 5. A total 13 demonstrators were arrested. Another protest was conducted on January 18, 2016 (Martin Luther King, Jr. Day), with demonstrators against the deaths of Clark and Marcus Golden (a man who Saint Paul police had killed a year prior) blocking the Lake Street-Marshall Bridge for a short time. Protesters insisted that a special prosecutor should hear Clark's case, instead of a grand jury convening to decide whether Clark's shooting was justified. Legal actions In February, per the requests of local officials, the U.S. Department of Justice's Community Oriented Policing Services office announced that they would be conducting a review of the way the city handled the November protests. On March 16, Mike Freeman, Hennepin County Attorney, announced that his office would cease the use of grand juries in shootings involving police officers. The announcement was met with approval from activists and described by the Star Tribune as a \\"rare move\\" with potential ramifications throughout the country. Later in March, in preparation for Freeman's office's announcement about whether they would be pursuing charges against Ringgenberg and Schwarze, Harteau released a video warning against \\"violence or disruption\\" based on Freeman's actions. On March 30, Freeman announced that no charges against the officers would be filed.

It is considered a cultural district because of its close proximity to higher educational campuses and art destinations. It was named to imply that the area is full of possibility due to the number of learning and creative campuses in this small area. \\"Culture, art, and academia converge and present the Discovery District.\\" While not typically viewed as the most prominent Columbus neighborhood, the density of academic and arts-based institutions in this area are what make this creative campus unique. History The Discovery Special Improvement District was created in 2007. As a special improvement district (SID), its property owners have agreed to pay a special tax to help maintain the area and keep it clean and safe. The services they are paying for include employing safety ambassadors, a homeless outreach specialist, and a safety coordinator. They also pay to have first-floor graffiti removed and to promote the area through PR and communications publications in various outlets throughout the city, to promote visitors and make the area a downtown Columbus destination. Before the Discovery District was an SID, it was considered an unsafe area of the city, and officials recognized the need for something to be done, especially with a large student demographic in the area attending either Columbus State Community College or the Columbus College of Art and Design. In 2007, a Board of Directors overseeing two private, non-profit organizations, the Columbus Downtown Development Corporation (CDDC) and the Capitol South Community Urban Redevelopment Corporation (Capitol South), made this area their new project. These two organizations have backed multiple special improvement districts in the Columbus area, including the Discovery District and the Capitol Crossroads Special Improvement District. The CDDC was formed in 2002 in order to implement the Downtown Strategic Plan while Capitol South was formed earlier, in 1974, to redevelop the area south of Capitol Square. Other buildings in the area remain historic landmarks and were in place long before the Discovery District was given its name. These include the Kelton House, the First Congregational Church on Broad Street, and the Broad Street United Methodist Church. Special Improvement District  The main priorities of the Discovery Special Improvement District are to eliminate disorder and prevent crime. Around 80% of revenue raised from the district is directed towards these goals. Some safety improvements made to the district include creation of safety ambassadors, the hiring of a specialty police force, and the establishment of a full-time outreach program. Through the safety ambassadors program, security guards from the major institutions in the district have joined forced to \\"close the gaps\\" in the district. The ambassadors created a security network in which they can easily communicate with each other. The security guards also meet every two months to check up with each other and make sure that the correct pathways of communication are in place. The specialty police force also enhances security in the district. This police force consists of a number of beat cops focused on crime solely within the Discovery District. The force is extremely effective and guarantees a quick response to any safety threats. Lastly, the Discovery's outreach program has provided support to the homeless in the area. This program connects the homeless with jobs and rehabilitation centers that are necessary to those requiring help. Some common crime occurrences before the creation of the SID included camping, panhandling, defecation, and auto theft. Now, the district experiences limited crime due to the heightened security. The safety improvements were so revolutionary that the SID received the Homeland Security Award in 2014. The remaining 20% of revenue is dedicated to marketing for the district and for seasonal events. Geography=Boundaries An outline of the Discovery District with red areas as an indication of parking lots located in the district in 2015 The Discovery District has slightly varying boundaries depending on the source. The Discovery District is bounded to the north by I-670, to the east by Jefferson Avenue and Lester Drive, to the south in a zig-zag pattern until it reaches I-70, and then to the west by South Grant Avenue. Buildings and landmarks This district is home to various cultural and educational institutions. The Columbus Metropolitan Library, one of the highest-ranking large-city libraries in the nation, is an example of this. Its main branch location is within the bounds of the Discovery District, and is currently under construction and closed to the public. The Columbus Museum of Art is another example and is home to a wide array of American and European Art, as well as many contemporary and photographic collections. Among its educational institutions are the Columbus College of Art and Design, Columbus State Community College, Franklin University, and Capital University Law School. The Columbus College of Art and Design is a nationally ranked school for the arts, while Columbus State Community College is a well-known community college in the area, with many of its students beginning there and then transferring through to a four-year school in Columbus, such as The Ohio State University, Otterbein University, or Ohio Dominican University, or another school in Ohio. The Kelton House is a Greek Revival and Italianate mansion in the Discovery District that was converted to a museum by the Junior League of Columbus \\"to promote an understanding of daily life, customs, and decorative arts in 19th century Columbus and to educate visitors about the Underground Railroad.\\" The Columbus Museum of Art The area also contains several religious institutions including The First Congregational Church on Broad Street and Broad Street United Methodist Church. Residential The Columbus Metropolitan Library's main branch The majority of residents in the Discovery District reside in apartment-style buildings. This is due to the urban setting and the student-heavy population; many of these apartments are listed online as \\"luxury student housing.\\" These include more than ten buildings, each multiple stories. The Columbus Housing Partnership, also called Homeport, among a few other housing options, is considered to be affordable housing solutions, or Section 8 Housing. This means that the organization focuses on affordable housing solutions and provides rental and for-purchase homes, financial education and social services for low-income individuals and families to help them succeed where they live. Another large portion of land in the Discovery District goes towards parking lots for the many apartment buildings, as well as those servicing many of the higher education buildings, Columbus State Community College, Columbus College of Art and Design, Franklin University, Capital University Law School, or the Columbus Museum of Art. Parks Topiary Park in Discovery District The Discovery District is home to the Topiary Park and Thurber Park. Topiary Park, otherwise known as The Old Deaf School Park, began construction in 1988 and uses topiaries to represent Georges Seurat's painting, A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grand Jatte. The park is seven acres and is home to 67 separate topiary figures, more than 220 trees, and a pond. The Thurber Park is an oval piece of grass set across from the Thurber House, temporary residence of James Thurber, on Jefferson Street. The park is half an acre and contains a gazebo, walkways, and trees. Commercial= Dining  The Discovery District is home to multiple restaurants, including a variety of cuisines. These dining options have helped to keep people in the area after business hours to eat dinner, whereas without these amenities, the district was formerly a \\"ghost town\\" after the Columbus Metropolitan Library and Columbus Art Museum closed for the day.  Events and entertainment  The district is one of the many hosts to the annual Columbus Art Walks, a series of self- guided walking and audio tours through Columbus's downtown districts. Among its many destinations are the locations listed above. According to the Columbus Art Walks website, \\"The Discovery District Art Walk will lead you through the Northeastern portion of Downtown Columbus. Experience Columbus' Creative Campus where Columbus State Community College, Columbus College of Art and Design, and several downtown arts and cultural institutions all converge. You will find hidden murals on buildings, artistic surprises in parks, historic architectural landmarks, and much more!\\" The district also hosts seasonal events to bring people to the area around the winter holiday season, including one called the Holiday Trolley Hop, a tour of the district by trolley in the evening, with stops for activities, crafts, tours, and shopping. One year, the Hop took visitors to Topiary Park, Kelton House, Bosco Center, Columbus Museum of Art, Hills Market Downtown, Thurber House, and the State Auto Nativity Display. The district hosts the Topiary Theater Summer Movie Series. The district partners with the Columbus Metropolitan Library and the Gateway Film Center to put on a book-to-film series in Topiary Park, next to the Ohio School for the Deaf. The Discovery District also creates sand volleyball courts in the summer as a part of \\"Discovery Beach\\". The beach is located at 100 N. Grant Avenue and is open and free to volleyball players all summer long. The YMCA hosts a spring and summer volleyball league at the beach as well.

It is the southern terminus of the airport branch of Barcelona Metro line 9 (L9) and is operated by Transports Metropolitans de Barcelona (TMB). Opened in 2016, the station is located underneath the airport terminal and consists of two levels. The trains run on the lower level, where there is a island platform featuring screen doors. Adjacent to the station is a depot that can accommodate 12 trains. A new commuter rail link is projected to reach the station around 2018.  History  A tunnelling machine began excavating the tunnel for Barcelona Metro line 9 from to the Airport T1 station in March 2008 and finished in April 2009. The completion of the station's main structure was part of the construction of terminal T1, which opened in June 2009. When the terminal opened, the airport branch of L9 was expected to be ready for passenger service in 2012. In March 2012, however, the Government of Catalonia announced that the opening date for the section of the line between the airport terminals and Zona Universit√†ria station would be postponed until 2014. In June 2014, the government announced that the section, apart from the , and stations, would open in the first half of 2016. The first day of passenger service was 12 February 2016.  Train service  Service on the airport section of Barcelona Metro line 9 (L9), designated L9 Sud (\\"South\\"), operates driverless with a service frequency of 7 minutes in each direction between Airport T1 and in western Barcelona. Additional partial services may be added if necessary, reducing the frequency to 4 minutes. Passengers using the metro stations located at the airport terminals are required to purchase a special ticket known as an airport ticket; basic single tickets issued by the operating company Transports Metropolitans de Barcelona (TMB) are not valid. The airport ticket costs ‚Ç¨4.50 and also gives access to the rest of the TMB-operated Barcelona Metro system. Multiple-use tickets and unlimited passes issued by the Autoritat del Transport Metropolit√† (ATM)‚Äîa public agency in charge of coordinating public transportation operators in the Barcelona area‚Äîare valid, with the exception of the T-10 ten-trip ticket. Future Commuter rail services to central Barcelona will also serve the station once a new airport rail link is built. Although a rail link has existed since 1975, it only reaches terminal T2, which is from terminal T1.Distance measured using Google Maps's \\"Distance Measurement Tool\\". Construction work for the new link began in July 2015, and the project is expected to be completed in 2018. There is also a project to extend Barcelona Metro line 2 (L2) southwards using the route of the L9 between and Airport T1 stations.

His works have been produced by ballet and opera companies in many countries of the world.Marina Grut, \\"Rodrigues, Alfred,\\" in The History of Ballet in South Africa (Cape Town: Human & Rousseau, 1981), pp. 405-406. Early life and training Born in Cape Town, a cosmopolitan city near the southern tip of South Africa, Alfred Rodrigues made his first appearance on stage as a child. In 1936, when he was 14, he saw a performance by Colonel de Basil's Ballet Russe when the company toured South Africa, and his interest in ballet was kindled. He joined the Cape Town Ballet Club in 1937 after he saw an advertisement placed in a newspaper by Dulcie Howes, asking for male dancers. Subsequently, as a student in the ballet classes of the celebrated teacher Cecily Robinson, he failed to show any particular talent as a dancer, but in workshops he did demonstrate a certain flair for choreography. He made his first ballet in 1938, a short piece for students in the Ballet Club set to a piano transcription of \\"Danse Macabre,\\" a tone poem (op. 40) by Camille Saint-Sa√´ns with spooky melodies, driving rhythms, and dramatic structure. Encouraged by Howes, he soon made two other works for the club, Le Roi s'Amuse (1940) and L'√éle des Sir√®nes (1941).Richard Glasstone, Dulcie Howes: Pioneer of Ballet in South Africa (Cape Town: Human & Rousseau, 1996), p. 64. Professional career Rodrigues's promising career as a choreographer was interrupted by the outbreak of World War II. He joined the South African army and saw combat in Egypt and Syria before being demobilized at the end of the war. In 1946, he arrived in England on a troopship, made his way to London, and resumed his dance studies with Stanislas Idzikowski and Vera Volkova, who taught at the Sadler's Wells Ballet School. One of his first dancing jobs was in the West End production of Song of Norway, the hit musical with choreography by George Balanchine.Debra Craine and Judith Mackrell, \\"Rodrigues, Alfred,\\" in The Oxford Dictionary of Dance (Oxford University Press, 2000). The next year, 1947, he was invited to join the Sadler's Wells Ballet, as male dancers were in short supply in postwar London. In 1949, he was promoted to soloist and was encouraged to pursue his choreographic interests, whereupon he restaged L'√éle des Sir√®nes for a tour by Margot Fonteyn and Robert Helpmann, the stars of the company. As a dancer, he toured the United States and Canada with the company but made no mark as a performer. As a choreographer and producer, however, he was more successful, making several ballets for the Sadler's Wells Theatre Ballet that were well received.Mary Clarke, \\"Alfred Rodrigues,\\" obituary, The Guardian (London), 18 February 2002. Having won critical approval for his work, Rodrigues decided to pursue a free-lance route, concentrating on a career as a choreographer. He started in 1955 in Italy, with a production of Romeo and Juliet in the Roman amphitheater in Verona and a production of Cinderella for the Teatro alla Scala in Milan. Both ballets were set to music by Sergei Prokofiev, and both were staged especially for French ballerina Violette Verdy. After these two productions, he proceeded to mount his ballets all over the world, working in Poland, Denmark, Turkey, the United States, Chile, Japan, Germany, the Philippines, and South Africa. With his gifts for the theatrical and the dramatic, he generally favored narrative works.Grut, \\"Rodrigues, Alfred,\\" in The History of Ballet in South Africa (1981), p. 405.

Other works Rodrigues was also active in popular musical theater, in movies, and in television productions. Among the West End musicals and revues for which he created dances are Airs on a Shoestring (1953), Joyce Grenfell Requests the Pleasure (1954), Pay the Piper (1954), Chrysanthemum (1956), Ann Veronica (1960s), and On the Brighter Side (1961). His greatest success was Charlie Girl (1963). Starring Dame Anna Neagle, it ran for five years at the Adelphi Theatre. In British film history, Rodrigues is known for An Alligator Named Daisy (1955), Oh, Rosalinda! (1955), and Show Band Parade (1957). On television, he created dances for the series Eric Robinson Presents On the Bright Side, which aired during the 1960s.Grut, \\"Rodrigues, Alfred,\\" in The History of Ballet in South Africa (1981), p. 405. His facility in creating lighthearted dances served him as well in musical theater as on the ballet stage. Personal and later life In 1948, Rodrigues married British ballerina and teacher Julia Farron, with whom he had a son. Christopher. They were a devoted couple. In old age, Rodrigues became severely handicapped, but as late as 1996, he was in Japan to revive Cinderella for the Kobayashi company, with Farron giving him support by acting as \\"his legs.\\" Wherever he worked, he was loved by his dancers for his humor, warmth, and compassion. He died at age 80, after a long and unusually productive career.

Markham's best- known work, it was a bestseller of its time, going through nine editions, and at least two other reprints, by 1683. It was issued as a two-volume work, Countrey Contentments, the other volume being The Husbandmans Recreations. Although Markham disclaims authorship in the preface, he did adapt the recipes to suit current tastes, notably with sweet and sour sauces. The book contains what is probably the first published recipe for Banbury cake. Context Markham was the third son of Sir Robert Markham of Cotham, Nottinghamshire, and was probably born in 1568. He was a soldier of fortune in the Low Countries, and later was a captain under the Earl of Essex's command in Ireland. He wrote voluminously on many subjects, to the extent that his booksellers procured from him a declaration in 1617 that he would write no more on certain topics. Book The two-volume book was dedicated to Sir Theodore Newton. The English Huswife was issued as the second part of Covntrey Contentments, In Two Bookes, The first, containing the whole art of riding great Horses in very short time... Likewise in two new Treatises the arts of hunting, hawking, coursing of Grey-hounds with the lawes of the leash, Shooting, Bowling, Tennis, Baloone &c.; The Second intituled, The English Huswife: Containing the Inward and Outward Virtues Which Ought to Be in a Complete Woman: as her Phisicke, Cookery, Banqueting-stuffe, Distillation, Perfumes, Wooll, Hemp, Flaxe, Dairies, Brewing, Baking, and all other things belonging to an Houshold.Markham, title page. The first book is named on its first page as The Husbandmans Recreations.Markham (1615) The Husbandmans Recreations, page 1. Approach Markham begins with a single paragraph disclaimer, starting \\"Thou mayst say (gentle Reader) what hath this man to doe with Hus-wifery, he is now out of his element\\", and explaining that it is an \\"approved Manuscript which he happily light[ed] on, belonging sometime to an honorable Personage of this kingdome, who was singular amongst those of her ranke for many of the qualities here set forth.\\"Markham, preface (unnumbered page in front matter). Markham does not name the lady in question. Each recipe is given in a paragraph without a section heading, the title of the recipe being given instead in italics in the margin beside the recipe, as \\"Sauce for veale\\", or \\"Of puff pastrie\\"; sometimes the titles are written as goals, like \\"To make ginger bread\\". The recipes are given without lists of ingredients, and mainly without quantities. Thus, the pancake recipe calls for \\"two or three Eggs\\" mixed with \\"a pretty quantity of fair running water\\", with the comment \\"There be some which mix Pancakes with new Milk or Cream, but that makes them tough, cloying, and not so crisp, pleasant and savory as running water.\\" The amount of flour in the pancakes is left up to the cook with the instruction \\"make it as thick as you think good with fine Wheat-flower\\". He includes the sweet spices cloves, mace, cinnamon, and nutmeg, and serves the pancakes strewn with sugar. The recipes rarely give any details of the heat or time required for cooking: thus the pancake recipe merely says \\"make them brown\\". But the book does explain how to roast meat so it is properly cooked. Gervase Markham's recipe for Banbury Cake, in The English Huswife, 1615 Banbury cakes The recipe for \\"a very good\\" Banbury cake is probably the earliest published version. It calls for four pounds of currants, washed and dried; three eggs, beaten; yeast (\\"barm\\"); sweet spices; a pint of cream and a pint of warm milk; and unstated quantities of flour, butter and sugar. The dough is to be kneaded for \\"an houre or more\\", while the cake is to be baked \\"according to the bignesse\\".Markham, pages 75‚Äì76 A version of this recipe, adapted for small cakes, was given in The Guardian in 2012. Contents The 128-page book begins with \\"The Table\\", a table of contents listing the tasks and recipes in the book. It does not name the book's chapters, into which it is in fact divided. The titles shown are those used as page headers; Chapter 2 containing several of these. * Chapter 1: House-hold Physicke. 1 * Chapter 2: Skill in Cookery. 36 ** Banquetting Stuffe. 69 ** Distillation. 79 ** Muske-balls, &c.; 81 * Chapter 3: Of Woolle, Hempe, Flaxe and Cloth. 83 ** Dying of Wooll. 83 ** Skill in Hempe, Flaxe, &c.; 87 * Chapter 4: Of Dairies, Butter, Cheese. 104 * Chapter 5: Of the office of the Brew-house, and the Bake-house. 120 ** Brewing. 120 ** Baking. 126 Editions The following editions were printed. * 1615 1st edition.

Sawbridge Reception The British Library describes the book as a best-seller. It notes that although the title implies a female audience, only 5 to 10% of women were then literate, so most readers were clergymen or men of the gentry and the professions. It observes that Markham disclaimed authorship in the preface, but did adapt the recipes \\"to suit the fashions of the day\\", with sweet and sour sauces \\"very much in vogue at the time\\". He also included recipes from France, Spain and Italy. Linda Woodbridge, reviewing Michael Best's edition of The English Housewife, describes it as a splendid modern text. She describes the maladies for which Markham proposed remedies as \\"some picturesque, some desperate\\", as they included \\"stinking breath which cometh from the stomach\\", \\"pimpled or red-saucy face\\", \\"griefs in the stomach\\", \\"desperate yellow jaundice\\", \\"pissing in bed\\", \\"falling of the fundament\\", and \\"privy parts burned\\". The remedies make use of \\"curatives as homely as parsley, as exotic as dried stag's pizzle. She notes that in the two parts of Countrey Contentments, Markham expected the country gentlemen to lead a purely recreational life, the country gentlewoman to have \\"one long round of unremitting hard work.\\" But Woodbridge notes that at least booksellers of the time were recognising \\"that a substantial market of literate female book- buyers was something worth catering to.\\" Kate Colquhoun calls the book an \\"enormously popular collection of culinary and medical recipes\\", which she characterises as \\"aimed squarely at the well-off middling sort\\". She describes Markham as \\"always on the lookout for the detail that would make the difference\\", giving as example the way he explains how to make pastry of different kinds: rye paste with hot water and a little butter for a long- lasting \\"coffin\\"; for meat pies, \\"a good white crust 'somewhat thick'\\" of wheat flour with hot water or mutton broth and plenty of butter; and \\"melting short paste\\", with flour dried out in a warm oven and gently mixed with eggs, butter and cold water, to be rolled thin and served hot around delicate foods like chicken or fallow deer.

It has more than 80,000 participants in 140 countries who share more than 19 million potential threats daily. It is free to use. Founded in 2012, OTX was created and is run by AlienVault (now AT&T; Cybersecurity), a developer of commercial and open source solutions to manage cyber attacks. The collaborative threat exchange was created partly as a counterweight to criminal hackers successfully working together and sharing information about viruses, malware and other cyber attacks. Components OTX is cloud-hosted. Information sharing covers a wide range of issues related to security, including viruses, malware, intrusion detection and firewalls. Its automated tools cleanse, aggregate, validate and publish data shared by participants. The data is validated by the OTX platform then stripped of information identifying the participating contributor. In 2015, OTX 2.0 added a social network which enables members to share, discuss and research security threats, including via a real-time threat feed. Users can share the IP addresses or websites from where attacks originated or look up specific threats to see if anyone has already left such information. Users can subscribe to a ‚ÄúPulse,‚Äù an analysis of a specific threat, including data on IoC, impact, and the targeted software. Pulses can be exported as STIX, JSON, OpenloC, MAEC and CSV, and can be used to automatically update local security products. Users can up-vote and comment on specific pulses to assist others in identifying the most important threats. OTX combines social contributions with automated machine-to-machine tools that integrates with major security products such as firewalls and perimeter security hardware. The platform can read security report in .pdf, .csv, .json and other open formats. Relevant information is extracted automatically, assisting IT professionals to more readily analyze data. Specific OTX components include a dashboard with details about the top malicious IPs around the world and to check the status of specific IPs; notifications should an organization's IP or domain be found in a hacker forum, blacklist or be listed by in OTX; and a feature to review log files to determine if there has been communication with known malicious IPs. In 2016, AlienVault released a new version of OTX allowing participants to create private communities and discussions groups to share information on threats only within the group. The feature is intended to facilitate more in-depth discussions on specific threats, particular industries, and different regions of the world. Threat data from groups can also be distributed to subscribers of managed service providers using OTX.\\" Technology OTX is a big data platform that integrates natural language processing and machine learning to facilitate the collection and correlation of data from many sources, including third-party threat feeds, websites, external API and local agents. Partners In 2015, AlienVault partnered with Intel to coordinate real-time threat information on OTX. A similar deal with Hewlett Packard was announced the same year. Competitors Both Facebook and IBM have threat exchange platforms. The Facebook ThreatExchange is in beta and requires an application or invitation to join.

The mummy is well-preserved, due to the extreme cold and dry conditions of its high altitude burial location. The frozen mummy was discovered by hikers in 1985 at on Aconcagua in Mendoza, Argentina. Discovery The Aconcagua mummy was buried inside a semicircular stone structure and found covered in vomit, red pigment, and fecal remains. The body was wrapped in textiles in a style derived from central coastal Peru. Six statuettes were also found buried with the body. An analysis shows that the boy's diet consisted primarily of maize, quinoa, capsicum, potatoes, and terrestrial meat. A year and a half before his death, his diet became more marine-based. The presence of achiote was also found inside his stomach and colon. Archaeogenetics In 2015, DNA was extracted from a sample from one of his lungs. His mtDNA lineage belongs to a subgroup of Haplogroup C1b, the previously unidentified C1bi (i for Inca). His mtDNA lineage contains 10 distinct mutations from C1b. The researchers determined that Haplogroup C1bi likely arose around 14,300 years ago. An individual from the Wari Empire was found to be a match for this previously unidentified haplogroup. In 2018, researchers sequenced the genome of the Aconcagua mummy from a sample from one of his lungs. His Y-DNA lineage belongs to Haplogroup Q-M3. His specific Y-DNA haplogroup is closest matched by the Choppca people from Huancavelica, a Quechua speaking population, and clusters closer to modern Quechua speaking peoples than Aymara speaking peoples.

Richard Montoya Papers. Julian Samora Library at the Institute for Latino Studies, 2012. Web. https://latinostudies.nd.edu/assets/134273/richardmontoyapapers.pdf His work in theatre is largely comedy-based and centers around ideas of racism, immigration, discrimination, and identity in Latin-American communities. He follows in the steps of his father, famous activist Jos√© Montoya, and is known for creating social and political change through a variety of artistic expressions.  Early life and education  Richard Montoya was born in San Diego, CA in 1959 to parents actively involved in the United Farm Workers Movement of the 1970s and 1980s. He was influenced by his family's involvement in matters of civil rights to pursue a career in political and social activism, and chose to accomplish these goals mainly through writing original works and acting in plays and films concerned with matters of culture, racism, and Latino identity in the United States. He attended California State University, Sacramento in addition to studying at the American Conservatory Theatre. Montoya has also spent time working with Luis Valdez's famed El Teatro Campesino, as well as with the Sundance Institute's Writers and Directors Lab. He has been awarded two Annenberg Fellowships through the Sundance Institute. He used his 2007 grant to transform Water & Power, what was originally created as a play by Culture Clash, into the 2013 film of the same name. Career= Early career: Culture Clash  On May 5, 1984 Richard Montoya along with Ric Salinas, Herbert Sig√ºenza, Jos√© Antonio Burciaga, Marga G√≥mez, and Monica Palacios founded a performance troupe based out of the Mission District of San Francisco called Culture Clash with the goal of creating theatrical and artistic works of political satire through which controversial ideas of immigration and multiculturalism were discussed. In Montoya's words, Culture Clash was created to be \\"part gallery installation, [part] stand-up, [and part] theater ‚Äì Chicano Teatro\\" occurring at the \\"height [of] civil strife\\" in Latin-American Countries such as Nicaragua and El Salvador that worked in tandem with the United Farm Workers and the Chicano Movement to heighten political and social around multicultural issues of racism, immigration, discrimination, and more. Culture Clash focuses on creating works of satire mainly in the form of full-length plays and short comedic skits. Their works include Culture Clash in AmeriCCa, Chavez Ravine, and A Bowl of Beings.  Later career and notable works  Although Culture Clash is still a collective, Montoya has also branched out and created works of his own. In addition to works produced through Culture Clash, Montoya has authored and co-authored works for a variety of works for prominent theatre companies like Berkeley Rep, the Oregon Shakespeare Festival, and the San Diego Repertory Theatre. In addition to these co-authored works, as an independent writer he has created such works as Water & Power (play, 2006; film, 2013), American Night: The Ballad of Juan Jos√© (play, 2010), and The River (play, 2013). Montoya also served as a staff writer on the first season of NBC's Southland.  Critical reception  Works created through Culture Clash have received mixed reviews from critics and audience members. According to the LA Times, the 2003 production of the group's Chavez Ravine lacked depth and others said it was too long to hold audience's attention, even though audience members touted the work as \\"the group's most important play\\". The troupe revived the play in 2015 and received more positive, but still mixed, reviews. Montoya's individual creations, such as American Night: The Ballad of Juan Jos√©, which originally debuted at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival in 2010, were generally well received by critics, being called \\"fun and thoughtful\\". Water & Power, the 2013 film written and directed by Montoya has an average rating of 3.6/5 based on 152 ratings on Rotten Tomatoes, with 67% of audience members liking the film.

Dwyer befriended Segall after watching him perform with his then-band, The Traditional Fools, with a cast on his arm. Segall has stated that Dwyer's band Coachwhips were among his musical influences upon moving to San Francisco: \\"I moved [to San Francisco] in 2005 and was like, 'Oh man, I really like Coachwhips,' and they're not playing anymore.\\" Regarding Dwyer's prominence within the city's music scene, he noted: \\"The music community is amazing here, super-tight, and John Dwyer's like the Mayor of San Francisco. Come down here, you'll see him riding his bike, drinking a beer, and he'll probably take you out to get a taco. He's the nicest guy in the world.\\" Critical reception In a mixed review for Pitchfork, Stephen M. Deusner wrote: \\"Ultimately, Ty Segall sounds like a test run, a document of an artist discovering what all he can do by himself, which makes moments like the whistled outro on \\"Watching You\\", so reminiscent of Sergio Leone, all the more endearing.\\" Writing for Spin, Abigail Everdell praised the album, writing: \\"Warped sonics do nothing to diminish the impact of his vigorously nostalgic riff and stomp. From paranoid whistler \\"Watching You\\" to the huge, fuzzy pound of \\"The Drag\\", Segall thunders along with the timeless, impudently rowdy energy of a cement basement dance-off.\\" Track listingReferences 2008 debut albums Ty Segall albums Castle Face Records albums ","title":"Ty Segall (2008 album)"},{"id":"48577737","text":"Marion is a 1920 Italian silent film directed by Roberto Roberti and starring Francesca Bertini.Jandelli p.255 Cast * Francesca Bertini * Giorgio Bonaiti * Gina Cinquini * Mary Fleuron * Mario Parpagnoli ReferencesBibliography * Cristina Jandelli.

It should compete with the Pilatus PC-12 and Daher-Socata TBM, as well as other new projects such as the One Aviation Kestrel K-350 and the CAIGA Primus 150. Development In November 2015, GE Aviation announced its General Electric Advanced Turboprop (ATP) (now General Electric Catalyst) had been selected to power the aircraft. On 23 May 2016 Textron announced the SETP performance and cabin details. At the 2016 AirVenture in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, the project was named Cessna Denali. In May 2017, after testing with a fuel system ground testing rig and the propeller, Textron announced it had started building static and fatigue test articles, including the aft cargo door. Flight testing was to begin in the third quarter of 2018, followed by certification in 2019. In February 2018, assembly of the first prototype was underway in Wichita, for a first flight scheduled to occur before the end of the year. Service entry is scheduled for 2020. In May 2018 ground tests continued and all major components were being fabricated, including the nose, fuselage, wings and the tail cone. Three flying prototypes were being completed for an intended first flight scheduled for early 2019. By October 2018, the first prototypes fuselages and flight controls were nearly complete, and wings were starting to be constructed, towards a 2020 certification.

Metal bonding makes the wings more leak-proof to prevent fuel leaks, and automatic drilling saves some labor. The cabin is precisely mated to other structures thanks to careful edges routing and pin-locating tools.

Marble, Roman copy from the reign of Domitian (81‚Äì96 AD) after a Greek original from the 4th century BC. From the Imperial Palace The Palace of Domitian was built as Roman emperor Domitian's official residence in 81-92 AD and was used as such by subsequent emperors.Rome, An Oxford Archaeological Guide, A. Claridge, 1998 p. 134 Its remains sit atop and dominate the Palatine Hill in Rome, alongside other palaces. The Palace is a massive structure separated today into three areas, in part following the way business matters and private life were separated so they could be conducted in parallel. The modern names used for these parts are: * the Domus Flavia * the Domus Augustana * the garden or \\"stadium\\". It has not been fully exposed as parts lie under more recent buildings. The palace was one of Domitian‚Äôs many architectural projects, renovation of the Circus Maximus, renovation of the Pantheon, and three temples deifying his family members: the temple of Vespasian and Titus, the Porticus Diuorum, and the Temple of the gens Flavia.Darwall-Smith, Robin Haydon. Emperors and Architecture: A Study of Flavian Rome. Brussels: Latomus Revue D'Etudes Latines, 1996. History It was designed by the architect Rabirius. The palace was built on top of earlier buildings, notably Nero's Domus Transitoria and the Republican House of the Griffins, significant remains of which have been discovered. Under Severus a large extension was added along the southwestern slope of the hill overlooking the Circus Maximus, but otherwise the bulk of the Palace as constructed under Domitian remained remarkably intact for the remainder of the Empire. The Palace functioned as the official residence of the Roman Emperors until the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD. Domus Flavia The Domus Flavia is the public wing of the Palace. Domus Augustana The Domus Augustana was believed to be the private wing of the palace. The Garden or \\"stadium\\" Garden or \\"stadium\\" of the Palace of Domitian Head of the type \\"Anzio Apollo\\". Greek insular marble, Roman copy from the early Flavian period after a Greek original from the second half of the 4th century BC. From the \\"stadium\\" The so-called \\"Hippodrome\\" or \\"Stadium\\" of Domitian (160 x 48 m) extends over the entire eastern side of the Domus Augustana. It has the appearance of a Roman Circus but is too small to accommodate chariots. It was in reality an huge and elaborate sunken garden and most of the statuary in the nearby Palatine museum comes from the Stadium.Archaeological Guide to Rome, Adriano La Regina, 2005, Electa Domitian liked this form of garden as shown by the one he also built at his country villa in the Alban Hills. It may have been used as a private riding school which must have been present in the private villas of the time, according to Pliny the Younger; in the Acts of the Martyrs, a Hippodromus Palatii is mentioned concerning Saint Sebastian, which must certainly have been this. On the eastern side is a large semi-circular exedra on 3 levels which was decorated with sculptures and fountains and commanded views of the garden below, with a belvedere on the top of its concrete dome. Around the perimeter ran a two-storey portico carried on slender columns veneered in expensive coloured marble, the lower level of which was a sheltered promenade and with an elaborate stuccoed roof vault.Rome, An Oxford Archaeological Guide, A. Claridge, 1998 History The Stadium was the last section of the palace to be built after the first two parts were completed in 92 AD. It replaced older buildings dating from the Republic to Nero. Brick stamps show that Hadrian reinforced the structure of the porticos and that in the Severan era the exedra was reduced to a quarter circle externally when the adjacent Severan baths were built. The small oval enclosure in the southern end dates to the time of Theodoric (early 4th c.) when it was perhaps used as a private amphitheatre (certainly not as a training ground for gladiators, as this type of show was abolished since the time of Honorius). The complex was discovered and excavated in the 18th century which was soon followed by looting which irreparably compromised the state of the building.

Early and family life Atkinson was born in Washington, D.C. but raised in Martinsburg, West Virginia, where his family moved when he was three. He graduated the Martinsburg High School, and then from the University of Virginia in 1950, where he was a member of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity. Interested in the ministry since his days at the Peterkin conference center, Atkinson then attended the Virginia Theological Seminary and graduated in 1953. Ministry Bishop Robert E.L. Strider ordained Atkinson as a deacon on June 6, 1953 and as a priest on February 24, 1954, as he served at St. Matthew's Episcopal Church in Wheeling, West Virginia (1953-1955). Rev. Atkinson served as rector of Christ Church in Fairmont, West Virginia from 1955-1958, when he was called to Trinity Episcopal Church in Huntington, West Virginia (1958-1964). He then moved to Tennessee to become rector of Calvary Episcopal Church in Memphis (1964-1973).West Virginia Diocesan newsletter September 2012, p. 3, available at http://www.wvdiocese.org/pages/newsletters/Dayspring/Sept2012.pdf In 1973, the diocesan convention elected him coadjutor to bishop Wilburn C. Campbell, who announced his impending retirement at the end of 1975. Presiding Bishop John E. Hines, bishop Campbell and bishop William Evan Sanders of Tennessee consecrated Atkinson as the 687th bishop in the Episcopal Church. His episcopate began with a controversy, as he had two children in the public schools and was placed on a Kanawha County school textbook committee amidst a violent textbook-banning controversy. That led to 16 sticks of dynamite being blasted on Halloween, 1974 at the Board of Education building a block from the Diocesan center, as well as to his vilification by some partisans both on the street and in print. Nonetheless, Atkinson (whom many called Bishop Bob) persisted, and after succeeding Rt.Rev. Campbell as West Virginia's fifth bishop in January 1976, also became a leading advocate within the Episcopal Church for the ordination of women. When the General Convention authorized such later in the year, he was among the first to ordain a woman, Rev. Margaret Phillimore. In 1980 Rt.Rev. Atkinson also joined other Anglican bishops protesting the South African government's revocation of bishop Desmond Tutu's passport. After his retirement from West Virginia in 1989 (and bishop John H. Smith becoming his successor), bishop Atkinson and his wife moved back to Charlottesville, Virginia where one of their daughters lived with he husband and family. Bishop Atkinson then assisted bishop Peter James Lee in the Episcopal Diocese of Virginia, especially in the Shenandoah Valley and adjacent counties of the Blue Ridge Mountains for five years. He and Rosemary then moved to Jacksonville, Florida, where their son's family lived. Death and legacy Bishop Atkinson died July 4, 2012 in Jacksonville. He was survived by his wife of 59 years, Rosemary, two daughters and a son and many grandchildren. He is buried at Emmanuel Church in Greenwood, Virginia, whose churchyard looks toward Rockfish Gap, Shenandoah National Park and ultimately West Virginia. He inspired Joe Massey to write books about the Virginia's colonial and historic churches.

The property includes rolling woods and a hay meadow, and a small cluster of farm outbuildings near the main house, a c. 1803 Cape style building. The property typifies early Vermont farmsteads, and is now protected by a preservation easement. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998. Description and history The Crows Nest is located on the west side of Sturgis Drive in northwestern Wilmington. Sturgis Drive is a former alignment of nearby Coldbrook Road, the principal road from the village center to its northwest. The farmstead originally consisted of , including land as far north as the current alignment of Coldbrook Road and as far east as Mann Road, which has been sold off for development. The remaining portions of the original farmstead now consist of 75 acres, most of which has been allowed to revert to woodland, and a roughly rectangular hay meadow above the farmstead complex, which now consists of just the original farmhouse and a modern barn. The farmhouse is a modest 1-1/2 story timber frame structure, five bays wide, with a side gable roof, central chimney, clapboard siding, and a rubble stone foundation that also includes some bedrock. A single-story ell extends to the rear of the right corner, and a shed-roof dormer extends across much of the back. The interior has a mix of original and Colonial Revival reproduction materials, the result of a 1925 restoration of the property. Original features appear to include wide pine floors and a Federal period fireplace surround. The 100-acre property was purchased in 1801 by Perley Barlett, and it is believed that he built the house, as the land was previously in the hands of absentee owners, and later records describe a farm on the land. The construction methods and architectural style of the house are consistent with an early 19th-century construction date. The property was used by a variety of owners as a farm until 1925, when it was converted to a vacation property. At that time, the property included two 19th-century barns on the far side of Sturgis Drive, which still stood when the property was listed on the National Register in 1998; they have since been torn down. Kate Sturgis, who did the conversion and restoration of the property, sold property to the town for the realignment of Coldbrook Road, and sold off additional parcels for the construction of residences along Coldbrook Road and Sturgis Drive.

Williams earned a degree at Swansea University, doctorates at Manchester and Cambridge universities and a professorship at Aberystwyth University. He was highly regarded by his colleagues, and made a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1939. He died of cancer at the age of 42. Early life Williams was born in the Ceredigion village of Cwmsychbant to stonemason James and Elizabeth (n√©e Lloyd) Williams. He attended Llanwenog Primary School, then Llandysul School, where he was a close friend of Evan Tom Davies and, like Davies, excelled in mathematics. From there Williams, at the age of 16, won a ¬£55 scholarship to Swansea University where he studied physics and attained a first-class honours degree in 1923. Character Williams was stocky and strong, with blue eyes, brown hair and a broad grin; he was gregarious, passionate about cricket, and enjoyed practical jokes. Career From Swansea, Williams went into physics research at Manchester University's physics laboratories under Lawrence Bragg. At Manchester he attained a doctorate in physics in 1926 for his work with Bragg, studying X-rays in gases, then a second degree at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge under Ernest Rutherford. In 1930 he obtained a University of Wales D.Sc. Much of Williams's work was on sub-atomic particles, and in 1933 he spent a year working with Niels Bohr in Copenhagen where (Blackett considered) he did his best work. Throughout the 1930s he worked on developing theories further, and lectured in physics at Manchester and Liverpool, where he worked with James Chadwick. His work included attempting to prove the existence of Hidiki Yukawa's hypothetical pi meson particle, and in 1939 Williams was the first person to witness the process experimentally and to photograph it. In 1938 Williams was appointed Chair of Physics at the University College of Wales in Aberystwyth and continued his experiments with sub-atomic particles using a cloud chamber. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1939. Early on in World War 2 Blackett asked Williams to join RAE Farnborough to apply his imaginative physical mind to the problem of the U-boat menace. One of the results was the MDS (magnetic detection of submarines) system which was taken up with enthusiasm by US scientists when presented to them by Sir Henry Tizard in 1940. In 1941 Williams joined Blackett at the newly formed Operational Research Section at the Admiralty's Coastal Command where he worked for several more years devising more effective methods of dealing with German submarines. Williams was diagnosed with cancer in 1944 and, despite two operations, he was able to visit Washington in 1945 in connection with the continuing war in the Far East, and also write a scientific paper as a tribute to Niels Bohr on his sixtieth birthday. Death Williams died in September 1945 at his parents' home in Brynawel, Carmarthenshire, at the age of 42. He was buried at Capel y Cwm, Cwmsychbant. His obituary for the Royal Society was written by Blackett, who also broadcast a radio appreciation of Williams in 1949, in which he said: In 1971 John Tysul Jones published a collection of articles about Williams.

He works for World of Sport Wrestling and New Generation Wrestling, performing under the ring name Nathan Cruz. He also performs for a number of British, European, and international promotions. Professional wrestling career=Various promotions (2006‚Äìpresent) After making his professional debut aged fifteen, Cruz worked for a number of independent promotions throughout Europe including Progress Wrestling, Real Deal Wrestling, Southside Wrestling, SOLO (Spain), WS (France) and EPW (Italy). In August 2009 while competing for RDW, he captured the RDW Tag Team Championships with Colossus, holding them for six months before losing them to Sykes and Lee Chaos. During their 2015 UK Tour, Cruz was invited to work on shows for Jeff Jarrett's Global Force Wrestling, competing against Jarrett himself. Cruz competed in WWN's Style Battle #7 tournament being defeated in the first round against Saieve Al Sabah. New Generation Wrestling (2008‚Äìpresent)Early career= Appearing under his real name Nathan Irwin, Cruz appeared on the first ever NGW show in 2008, before taking part in the tournament to crown its inaugural champion later in the year, losing in the quarter finals to Sam Bailey. After winning an award for acting at the age of seventeen, Cruz adopted the gimmick of a bratty actor, obsessed with idea of his celebrity status. In 2009, he began a longstanding series of matches against close friend Matt Myers, with the two exchanging victories before moving on to other feuds. Following a series of impressive wins, Cruz became involved in a feud with the veteran Alex Shane for the rights to Shane's 'Showstealer' gimmick. The feud ended at the Second Anniversary show when Cruz beat Shane in a Last Man Standing match to claim use of the 'Showstealer' moniker. =Cruz enterprises and first championship= Along with the 'Showstealer' moniker, Cruz also gathered an entourage who would go on to be named 'Cruz Enterprises'. They included bodyguard Colossus, manager/agent Richie West, girlfriend Melanie Price and waterboy Kev Cash. Cruz continued to collect victories, including a defeat of his trainer El Ligero during a feud with NGW Champion Sam Bailey and General Manager Mark Criteria, who refused to allow Cruz to compete for the championship. Eventually, in February 2011 Cruz faced and defeated Bailey for the NGW Championship, retaining the title in a street fight rematch and successfully defending it throughout 2011 against Martin Kirby, Dean Allmark, Joey Hayes and Cam Kraze. During the latter half of 2011, Cruz's feud with Matt Myers was reignited, with Cruz jealous of the folk hero status Myers held among the fans, insisting it should be him they adored. The two met for Cruz's NGW Championship at Eternal Glory 2011, with Myers pulling off a shock win to capture the title. =Losing streak= Following the loss of his title to Myers, Cruz embarked on a long losing streak lasting most of 2012, including two more consecutive losses to Myers. His Cruz Enterprises stable fractured and eventually disbanded, which led to a short feud between Cruz and former bodyguard Colossus, ending in a match at Eternal Glory 2012, which Cruz lost. With all the trappings of his pseudo celebrity gone, Cruz (kayfabe) turned to alcohol, frequently appearing visibly intoxicated at events and later drinking during matches. Cruz was moved down the card during this period to reflect his diminished status and he would put noticeably less effort into his matches. Cruz was considering retirement from wrestling in the spring of 2013 when he was approached by Matt Myers, who felt sorry for his long time friend and encouraged him to mend his ways. Myers challenged Cruz to a match at the Fifth Anniversary show, with the intention of bringing out the old Nathan Cruz and reminding Cruz and the crowd what the Showstealer was capable of. Their match ended in a no contest when both men were attacked by debuting faction The Control. Under the guidance of Richie West, Rampage Brown, Mark Haskins, Caz Crash and Sam Wilder beat Cruz unconscious and left him sidelined for almost a year. =Return and second championship= On returning to NGW as a face in the summer of 2014, Cruz engaged in a feud with The Control, specifically current NGW Undisputed Champion Rampage Brown. The early part of the feud focused on Cruz's redemption from his alcoholic gimmick and reestablishing him as a main event talent. From his return until July 2015, Cruz competed in the Davey Boy Cup, a loose series of matches between a group of established and up and coming stars in British wrestling with the focus more on in ring performance than wins and losses. Cruz made it to a final choice of three (the others being Bubblegum and Zack Gibson), from whom a winner would be selected by the Hart Smith family. Cruz eventually lost out to Zack Gibson, a fact which angered Cruz following Gibson's refusal to continue their Cup match when it reached a time limit draw earlier in the year. Cruz also pursued a title shot against Rampage Brown throughout 2015, finishing second in the 2015 Destiny rumble to Matt Myers and being repeatedly refused a match by now General Manager Richie West. After a number of victories, including over members of the Control, Cruz was finally granted a championship match with Rampage Brown at Ultimate Showdown. Despite interference from Richie West and the Control, Cruz defeated Rampage Brown for the championship ending his reign, which by then had lasted over two years and completing his redemption angle by becoming champion as a face. Cruz would continue to feud with the Control following his championship win, twice defending the title against Mark Haskins in addition to successful defences against El Ligero, CJ Banks and Zack Gibson, a match which ended a long term rivalry between the two stemming from two previous matches which ended in a double pin and a time limit draw respectively. All Star Wrestling (2010‚Äìpresent) In 2010 at age nineteen Cruz debuted for Brian Dixon's All-Star Wrestling, Europe's oldest and most active wrestling promotion. This made Cruz at the time the youngest full-time professional wrestler in the world and brought him under the long term personal mentorship of Marty Jones. Cruz spent the summer of 2010 working on All Star's holiday camp tours across the British Isles. Cruz again toured with All Star in 2011, where he worked a long term feud as a heel against El Ligero. The two would go on to compete in over sixty matches together throughout the year at both holiday camp and town hall shows. 2013 saw Cruz working the summer season as a face for the first time, working against Dash Wilder in another extensive feud. More recently Cruz has feuded with Dean Allmark over possession of the All Star British Championship, as well as being the opponent of choice for a number of visiting international stars including Joe Legend, PN Neuz, Shadow Phoenix, Fit Finlay and Dave Finlay Jr.. Progress Wrestling (2012‚Äì2017) Between March and December 2012, Cruz was the first ever Progress Champion, winning it in a four way bout with Mike Mason, Marty Scurll and El Ligero.http://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&nr;=77081 Throughout his reign Cruz refused to allow Ligero a second attempt at the championship, insisting he had already had the opportunity. He eventually lost the belt to El Ligero in a singles bout having bowed to continuous pressure to grant him a title match.http://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&nr;=85899 In 2013 Cruz was a vocal part of the Screw Indy Wrestling movement and feuded with Stixx. After an absence of over two years, in March 2015 at Chapter 19: Super Strong Style 16 Night 1 he was revealed to be the motivating force for heel group the Faceless, two of whom had recently become Progress Tag Team Championship. He also revealed old enemy El Ligero as another member of the group, renamed the Origin, and that he and Ligero held the championship belts.https://hashtagwrest.wordpress.com/2015/05/24/results-progress- thisis_progress-splx-sss16-part-1-live-results/ Dave Mastiff and Zack Gibson were later revealed as members. Explaining his actions, Cruz announced he was declaring war on the PROGRESS fanbase, with the intention of destroying all they held dear about PROGRESS and anyone who chose to stand in their way. The next night Cruz and Ligero lost the tag team titles to the Sumerian Death Squad (Tommy End and Michael Dante).http://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&nr;=125781 However, Cruz and Ligero won the titles back in November 2015 at Chapter 23.http://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&nr;=132957 Cruz and Ligero went on to successfully defend the titles against the Sumerian Death Squad, Tommaso Ciampa & Zack Sabre Jr,http://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&nr;=135778 and F.S.U (Mark Andrews & Eddie Dennis)https://wrestleropesuk.wordpress.com/2016/04/10/progress-wrestling- chapter-28-please-please-please-let-me-get-what-i-want-full-results/ before feuding with the London Riots (James Davis & Rob Lynch) who eventually won the titles from the Origin on 29 June 2016.https://wrestleropesuk.wordpress.com/2016/05/31/progress-wrestling- chapter-30-super-strong-style-16-day-one-full-results/ On June at Progress Chapter 36 he and the rest of the Origin defeat the team of F.S.U, Damon Moser and Jack Gallagher in a match that if they lost they would dissolve The Origin.https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&nr;=135791 On Chapter 40 he teamed with Ligero in a losing effort against F.S.U.https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&nr;=135796 During the match tension was shown between the members of the Origin. On Chapter 44, Cruz faced Ligero in a losing effort but attacked him after the match removing his mask.https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&nr;=162672,this led to a match in Chapter 46 where Cruz teamed with Zack Gibson in a winning effort against Ligero and Dave Mastiff.https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&nr;=162674 On chapter 48 Cruz defeated Rockstar Spud in a qualifying match to Super Strong Style 16. https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&nr;=162682 In the tournament Cruz was eliminated in the first round by Jeff Cobb. At chapter 50, Cruz and Gibson defeated Jimmy Havoc and Mark Haskins, after the match Cruz refused to celebrate with Gibson and walked away. He then explained in a promo on Progress' YouTube channel that he was walking away from Progress after the promotion did not give him opportunities now that they were expanding to different countries after he was with the promotion since day one.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yB5bYudiabQ WWE In May 2014, Cruz competed on a week long live event tour for WWE. At the end of the tour, Cruz worked a dark match on SmackDown, teaming with Justin Sysum to face The Usos. Cruz has also regularly attended WWE elite training camps held in the UK. Cruz appeared on the 13 August episode of NXT, losing to Elias Samson. In January 2017, during the WWE United Kingdom Championship Tournament, Cruz wrestled a dark match with Dan Moloney against Tucker and Saxon Huxley in a losing effort. W.O.S WRESTLING (Summer 2018‚Äìpresent) Nathan appeared in the re- boot of World of Sport Wrestling (AKA WoS Wrestling) in series 1, taking part in the inaugural Tag-Team competition, alongside Adam Maxted. He & Maxted successfully reached the finals where Cruz & Maxted would eventually be defeated by the new champions Kip Sabian & Iestyn Rees. After the match, Cruz would complete a Heel-Turn when he would blame Maxted for the loss and undertook a brutal attack. The episode following, Cruz would face Maxted in a ladder match, to be contested in a \\"Loser Leaves The Company\\" format. in an evenly contested bout, Maxted would eventually prevail, by retrieving a briefcase located high above the ring, which apparently contained a singles contract for W.o.S Wrestling, with the premise that as they were no longer a Tag-Team there would only be enough room on the roster for one of them.

It aired on December 16, 2015 on the cable network FX. The episode was written by James Wong and directed by Bradley Buecker. Plot Liz Taylor shows an elderly couple to their rooms while she reminisces on the repeating groups of people who check into the hotel, including drug addicts and adulterous partners. The elderly couple take their own lives, and while Liz finds it beautiful and poetic, Iris is annoyed with the amount of cleaning it will take to remove the blood from the walls. Influenced by the scene, Liz decides to take her own life, still mourning the death of Tristan Duffy, but Iris stops her, informing her that she has to complete any unfinished business before she follows through. Liz decides to reconnect with her son, and has Hazel set up a meeting for the two of them so she will not be trapped in the hotel. At a motel, Donovan has a confrontation with Rudolph Valentino, and kills him. At the hotel, Elizabeth has a similar encounter with Natacha, and kills the latter. Sally and John Lowe awe at a set of ears John has collected from his latest killing. James Patrick March meanwhile decides to immolate alive his captive building contractor who failed to meet his demands just as John enters. John asks him where he can find Alex, and he schedules them a formal dinner for them to talk. At the dinner, John confronts Alex for lying to him about Holden being at the hotel. Alex apologizes and the two make amends. She informs John that Elizabeth has threatened to kill her and Holden if she does not contain an outbreak of the virus that she started when she infected her patient, Max. Elizabeth is being questioned by the police in the disappearance of Will Drake, claiming that after the wedding he disappeared. Will appears in the middle of the interview, where Elizabeth brushes them out immediately. Will accuses Elizabeth of having Ramona kill him so she may inherit his money. Will informs her that she isn't in her will, but Elizabeth retorts by saying Lachlan Drake is, and that before he reaches eighteen, she will turn him, so she can be his legal guardian forever and inherit the money Will left for him. Alex and John convince the children she infected to come back to the hotel to be towheads, but only ends up trapping them in the enclosed hallway where they are confronted by Ramona Royale. Liz reunites with her son, Douglas Pryor, and discuss his life, and Liz convinces him to move out to Boulder so he may pursue his dream of running his own company and they make amends. Later, Liz and Iris plan to kill themselves, but Liz has second thoughts after Douglas asks her to be in his life again. The two then scheme to take over the hotel. Alex and John reunite and decide not to get divorced, and leave the hotel with Holden, but a betrayed Sally vows to kill John. Donovan and the Countess have dinner, where the two discuss the \\"messes\\" they have gotten into. Elizabeth asks Donovan to remove Will from the grounds, and Donovan agrees, but only if Elizabeth cleans up \\"his mess\\" as well, where she learns that he has killed Rudolph. She returns to the hotel upset, but Donovan tells her that he did it out of love. Elizabeth agrees to forgive him when Liz and Iris burst through the doors and begin shooting at them.

Dairy salt can vary in terms of quality and purity, with purer varieties being the most desirable for use in foods. Dairy salt has been used since at least the 1890s in England and the United States. In butter preparation, it serves to retain moisture, while in cheeses, it tends to reduce water content and slow the ripening process. Purity Quality dairy salts have been described as having favorable solubility properties for use in butter and cheese, and the softness and form of the salt crystals is one of the determining factors of overall quality. The purity of dairy salt is defined by the amount of sodium chloride present in the product, and those with at least 98% sodium chloride have been described as being of sound purity. Highly pure dairy salt has a pure white coloration, a uniformity in grain, and lacks any offensive odors or bitter flavor. Dairy salt products of lower purity may have a bitter flavor and poor solubility. The use of impure dairy salt can have adverse effects upon butter, spoiling its flavor, grain, and preservation. Impure dairy salt can make cheeses bitter, reducing their value. Impurities that may occur in dairy salt include calcium sulphate, calcium chloride, magnesium chloride, and to a lesser extent, sodium sulphate and magnesium sulphate. History An 1819 newspaper advertisement for various salts, including dairy salt An 1893 advertisement including content about The American Dairy Salt Co. Lt'd. In the 1890s, many brands of dairy salt were available. In England during this time, the Ashton and Higgins Eureka Salt brands were available (among others), and were used in the United States. U.S. brands of dairy salt in the 1890s included Diamond Crystal Salt and Genesee Salt, among others. Almost all of these brands were very pure, being 98‚Äì99% sodium chloride. In 1899, it was estimated that around 82 million pounds of salt were used in the United States specifically for dairy purposes. At that time, this amount of salt was valued at US $800,000. In 1914, it was written that American and Danish authorities were in agreement that large-sized, flat flake salt is the best type of dairy salt for use in butter products. During this time, almost all dairy salt was prepared using the process of evaporation. Some techniques included leaving brine in the sun to evaporate, or heating it with fire underneath iron pans, with the salt crystals remaining after the liquid evaporated. Additional methods included the Michigan grainer process and the vacuum pan process. In the 1920s, calcium sulphate was one of the most common impurities in dairy salt. During this time, the United States Department of Agriculture's had a 1.4% maximum allowance for calcium sulphate in dairy salt and table salt. Uses=Butter Dairy salt serves to retain moisture and increase the weight of butter products, adds flavor and serves as a preservative and antimicrobial, which can prevent bacterial contamination. Dairy salt used in butter preparation is sometimes referred to as butter salt and buttersalt. Cheese Dairy salt has been used in the preparation of cheeses. Its use can add flavor to cheeses, and it tends to reduce the water content in cheeses, which can influence the ripening process. The use of impure dairy salt can make cheeses bitter in flavor, reducing their value. The use of too much salt in cheese can adversely affect its flavor, resulting in a product with a mealy and dry texture that is slow to ripen. Dairy salt is used in Cheddar cheese, and serves to add flavor and reduce moisture. The reduction of moisture inhibits fermentation and slows the ripening process, which can produce a higher-quality cheese in terms of flavor and consistency.

The Krembil Research Institute (Krembil), formerly known as the Toronto Western Research Institute, is a non-profit academic medical research institute located in Canada's largest city, Toronto. The Krembil is one the principal research institutes of the University Health Network of academic teaching hospitals associated with the University of Toronto; the Krembil is also one of the largest research institutes in Canada focusing on human neurological disease from both a basic science and clinical research perspective. Research within the Krembil is directed at the development of treatments for neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease), epilepsy, stroke, brain tumours, concussions, spinal cord injuries, neurophthalmologic and other ocular disorders, multiple sclerosis and autoimmune disorders. The University Health Network (UHN) is Canada's largest academic medical centre, comprising four major teaching hospitals (Toronto Western Hospital, Toronto General Hospital, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto Rehabilitation Institute) and a strategic alliance with the Toronto Mount Sinai Hospital. The Krembil is the research institute of the Toronto Western Hospital and fulfills the mandate for neuroscience (including ophthalmology) and musculoskeletal health research within the UHN academic medical centre. In total, UHN devotes C$160 million a year to research and trains more than 3,200 undergraduate, graduate and medical students at its member hospitals and institutes in association with the University of Toronto. The University of Toronto is Canada's largest university and one of the biggest in North America, consistently ranking in the top 25 universities internationally in the Times Higher Education World University Rankings, the Academic Ranking of World Universities and the QS World University Rankings. History In 1895, twelve physicians in the west end of Toronto united to create the Toronto Western Hospital (TWH, or the \\"Western\\") in order to serve an overlooked culturally-diverse neighbourhood in Toronto. The Toronto Western Hospital first opened as a medication dispensary, followed by a 30-bed general hospital temporarily functioning out of two rented houses. By 1899 sufficient money was raised to purchase a nearby farmhouse and to build the Western on its present site. During construction, patients were treated year-round under large tents until the hospital officially opened in 1905. Throughout the 20th century, the Toronto Western Hospital functioned as a general hospital serving clients from culturally- and economically-diverse backgrounds. In the early 1980s, the Western took on additional neurological and neurosurgical care responsibilities for the UHN group of hospitals. Concomitant with this new clinical care focus, strength in applied neuroscience research began to emerge. In 1980, the Playfair Neuroscience Institute was created at the TWH to capitalize on this evolving neuroscience focus. In 1999, the Playfair Neuroscience Institute was renamed the Toronto Western Research Institute as it joined the Toronto General Research Institute and the Princess Margaret Research Institute as the three main hospital-based institutes within UHN. After this change, the Krembil also took on additional areas of research interest including ophthalmology, rheumatology and orthopaedics. By 2004, under the founding leadership of neurosurgeon C. Wallace, the Krembil had emerged as one of the largest research institutes in Canada with a neuroscience emphasis. On November 13, 2015, the Krembil took on its current name; prior to November 13, 2015, the Krembil was known as the Toronto Western Research Institute. The Krembils are among Canada's leading investors in neuroscience research. The impact at Toronto Western alone is $80 million, including the nine-storey, state-of-the- art Krembil Discovery Tower, which opened in 2013. Research Activities Krembil scientists are at work on a diverse array of human healthcare questions within multiple research programs. At the Krembil, neuroscientists explore the function of the nervous system as they develop treatments for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, spinal cord injuries, cerebral ischemia (stroke), vascular brain malformations, aneurysms, brain tumours and pain disorders. The Krembil is also home to the Vision Science Research Program, a joint UHN/University of Toronto Program. This research is directed into the following areas: molecular genetics of blinding eye diseases with brain disorders; treatment and biophysics of glaucoma; eye movement control mechanisms; neuronal damage; retinal degeneration and diabetic retinopathy. Arthritis and associated rheumatological degenerative diseases are the focus of the researchers in the musculoskeletal research program at the Krembil as part of the UHN Arthritis and Autoimmunity Research Centre. Their investigations are aimed at revealing the causes of, and generating therapies for, these autoimmune and orthopaedic ailments.

His works, revolving around the themes of migration, Judaism, and identity, have been translated to Russian, Czech, Slovenian, and Italian. Life Vladimir Vertlib was born on July 2, 1966 in Leningrad, USSR (now St. Petersburg, Russia). In 1971, at age 5, Vladimir Vertlib immigrated with his parents to Israel. The family‚Äôs migration odyssey continued with a move to Austria in 1972, followed by a passing stay in Italy before returning to Austria. In 1975, the family relocated briefly to the Netherlands and then to Israel, and in 1976 ‚Äì after a sojourn in Rome ‚Äì they returned to Vienna. In 1980, Vertlib and his parents immigrated to the United States of America; however, detention followed by deportation from the USA in 1981 led to the family ultimately settling in Vienna. Vladimir Vertlib became an Austrian citizen in 1986. Vertlib studied economics at the University of Vienna from 1984‚Äì89, and subsequently found employment as a freelancer for the Japanese press agency \\"Kyodo News Service.\\" He also worked as a statistician at the Donau Versicherungs AG, and as an analyst at the √ñsterreichische Kontrollbank AG. In 1990, as an alternative to compulsory military service in Austria, he completed his civilian service in a geriatric day care centre. Since 1993, he has been working as a freelance writer, social scientist, and translator in Salzburg and Vienna. Literary career His first two novels, Abschiebung (1995) and Zwischenstationen (1999) both deal with the partly autobiographical experience of exile, telling the stories of families who are migrating from the Soviet Union to other countries. Similar to Vertlib\`s trail of immigrations, in Zwischenstationen the family moves from Israel to Italy, followed by moves to Austria, the Netherlands, and the US, before finally settling in Vienna. Told from the perspective of a child, the novel reflects Vertlib's personal experience with migration: at home in Austria, but not Austrian-born, he based the story on his own feelings as a migrant child. Vertlib\`s novel Schimons Schweigen (2012) was the final episode of the unofficial trilogy revolving around migrant identity and coming to terms with his own odyssey. The protagonist, an Austrian author, travels to Israel, intending to solve the mystery of why his father and his father\`s friend Schimon ceased to communicate with each other for 30 years. The novel discusses the issue of displacement and the compromised identity experienced by the protagonist when outside of his homeland as a result of travels between Israel and the Soviet Union. Vertlib's Das besondere Ged√§chtnis der Rosa Masur (2001) tells the life story of a 92-year-old Jewish woman who migrated from Leningrad to Germany, and in doing so, covers Russia\`s 20th century history: anti-Semitism, communism and war. Similarly, the anthology Mein erster M√∂rder. Lebensgeschichten. (2006) contains life stories and depicts the course of the 20th century. In this instance, the characters featured through three life stories are displaced persons struggling to survive the catastrophes of the century. In Am Morgen des zw√∂lften Tages (2009), the love story of a German woman and a Muslim man depicts the complicated relationship between Orient and Occident, and between Christianity, Judaism, and Islam. Vertlib\`s most recent novel, Lucia Binar und die russische Seele (2015), features an 83-year-old woman and a young student who embark on an exceptional journey through Vienna, attempting to locate a call centre employee. Over the course of their journey, they meet several colorful people, experiencing bizarre phenomena of the Austrian society as well as learning about problematic social and political conditions in Russia. In 1995, he became a member of the editorial board of the Viennese literary journal Mit der Ziehharmonika, which became the Zwischenwelt ‚Äì Zeitschrift f√ºr Literatur des Exils und des Widerstands in 2000. Vertlib has numerous publications spanning short stories, articles, essays, reports, and reviews in German and Austrian newspapers and magazines. These include Die Presse (Spectrum), Wiener Zeitung (Extra), Rheinischer Merkur, FAZ, and J√ºdische Allgemeine, as well as periodicals like Wochen Zeitung Z√ºrich, Literatur und Kritik, and SALZ. He participated in the Klagenfurter Literaturkurs 1998 (International Forum for young writers) and the Festival of German-Language Literature, 1999, in Klagenfurt. He held the Dresdner Chamisso Poetics Lectureship in 2006, wrote the libretto for an oratory from Wolfgang R. Kubizek in 2007, and in 2012-13 worked as a lecturer at the Institute of Language Arts at the University of Applied Arts, Vienna. Major themes Most of Vertlib's works draw on his autobiographical experience of migration, and therefore deal with the themes of identity, home, and the trauma of being \\"uprooted.\\" He has stated that due to the migration, he experienced a disrupted childhood and youth. The process of writing helped him deal with the problems of displacement and a compromised sense of belonging, which are paralleled in the lives of his characters. His own identity is not easy to define, evident in reviews that label him \\"a Russian living in Austria,\\" \\"a Russian writer,\\" \\"a Jewish-German writer of Russian descent\\" and so on. Ultimately, negotiating identity is an important part of Vertlib\`s work. Furthermore, Vertlib's works deal with Judaism and the experience of being a Jewish migrant, capturing the collective history of Russian Jews in the 20th century through stories of individual characters. These examples ‚Äì composed of true experiences and fiction ‚Äì are intended to mirror the reader\`s own feelings and experiences. Culture is another major theme in Vertlib\`s works. Stating he has internalized the Russian, Jewish, and Austrian culture, he found his identity in a space between the cultures. Viewed through Edward Said\`s perspective, Vertlib\`s works show that cultures might be separated by social and political circumstances, but are not mutually antagonistic per se. Literary style Vertlib's writing has been described as sophisticated and provocative with an elaborated narrative structure. His prosaic and precise language is full of irony, depicting tragicomic experiences. He has stated that, for him, finding humour in tragedy has a relieving effect, indicating the significance of irony in his work. Critics praised Vertlib\`s works as thrilling as well as entertaining, comparing him to notable authors John Irving, Joseph Roth, and Isaak Singer.

A member of Tim Miles' coaching tree, Smith served as an assistant for Miles at four schools ‚Äì Mayville State, North Dakota State, Colorado State, and Nebraska. Smith was also a highly successful head coach at Mayville State from 2004 to 2007. Early life and education Born in Stephen, Minnesota, Smith graduated from the University of North Dakota in 1996 with a bachelor's degree in secondary education and Northern State University in South Dakota with a master's degree in education in 1999. Coaching career=Beginnings as assistant coach (1996‚Äì2004) Smith began his coaching career in 1996 as an assistant coach for one season at Mayville State University, an NAIA school in North Dakota. This was the first of several coaching roles under Tim Miles. Originally published in the Grand Forks Herald on April 29, 2012 as \\"From Mayville to the Big Ten.\\" In 1997, Smith enrolled in graduate school at Northern State, an NCAA Division II school in South Dakota, and became a graduate assistant with its men's basketball team. Returning to North Dakota, Smith was an assistant coach at Minot State from 1998 to 2001. In 2001, Smith reunited with Miles at then-NCAA Division II North Dakota State, where he was an assistant coach and director of operations for three seasons. Mayville State (2004‚Äì2007) After three seasons at North Dakota State, Smith returned to Mayville State, this time as head coach in 2004. Inheriting a team that had one win in the previous season, Smith led the Comets to 17 wins and a berth in the NAIA Division II Tournament in his first season of 2004‚Äì05. Smith's second season as Mayville State head coach in 2005‚Äì06 had a 28‚Äì6 record, good enough to break the record for most wins in program history. Mayville won the Dakota Athletic Conference (DAC) regular season and conference titles and qualified for the NAIA Tournament for the second straight season, this time making the quarterfinals. With a 27‚Äì9 record in Smith's final season 2006‚Äì07, Mayville State won both DAC titles again and made the championship round of the NAIA tournament as a no. 13 seed. Smith won NAIA Division II Coach of the Year honors in 2007 and DAC Coach of the Year Honors in 2006 and 2007. Assistant coach at Colorado State and Nebraska (2007‚Äì2014) Smith got his first NCAA Division I job on April 10, 2007 as director of operations at Colorado State, his third association with Tim Miles. Miles promoted Smith to a full assistant coach in 2008. During his time at Colorado State, Smith helped the team qualify for the 2010 CBI, 2011 NIT, and 2012 NCAA Tournament. On April 25, 2012, Smith followed Miles to Nebraska after Miles took the head coaching job there. Smith helped Nebraska make the 2014 NCAA Tournament. South Dakota (2014‚Äì2018) Smith became a head coach again on March 24, 2014, when South Dakota athletic director David Herbster named Smith men's basketball head coach. Following a 12‚Äì18 season in 2013‚Äì14, South Dakota went 17‚Äì16 (10‚Äì8 in Summit League play) in Smith's first season of 2014‚Äì15.https://www.sports- reference.com/cbb/schools/south-dakota/ In 2016‚Äì17, Smith won Summit League Coach of the Year honors after South Dakota won the Summit League regular season title and qualified for the 2017 NIT. Smith's last season in 2017 with the Coyotes ended 26‚Äì9, with a 2nd-place finish in the Summit League both in the regular season and conference tournament, the Coyotes would later fall to North Texas in the 2018 College Basketball Invitational first round 77-90. Utah State (2018‚Äìpresent) On March 26, 2018, Smith was announced as Utah State's new head coach after the firing of Tim Duryea. In just his first season at the school, he led the Aggies to a share of the Mountain West regular-season title, as well as the tournament title.

Wang utilized Maitreya teachings as a tool to organize his Millenarian troops. A much later supernatural novel The Three Sui Quash the Demons' Revolt based its story on this rebellion. Early life Wang Ze was a Zhuo Prefecture native who during a famine drifted to Bei Prefecture, where he sold himself to become a goatherd. Later he became a corporal in the army. Back when he left Zhuo Prefecture, his mother had tattooed the Chinese character fu (Á¶è; \\"auspiciousness\\") on his back as a talisman. Believers in the Maitreyan cult, present in great numbers in Bei Prefecture and the neighboring Ji Prefecture, spread the false rumor about his tattoo, and soon enough Wang became the cult leader. Their doctrine proclaimed, \\"Sakyamuni has declined and Maitreya shall rule the world.\\" With the assistance of subprefectural clerks Zhang Luan and Bu Ji, Wang's following spread to neighboring De Prefecture and Qi Prefecture. The original plan was to destroy the pontoon bridge in Chan Prefecture on 10 January 1048, but after the capture of cult activist Pan Fangjing (ÊΩòÊñπÂáà) ‚Äî for attempting and failing to assassinate the prefect of Daming ‚Äî Wang and his followers decided to rise in arms quickly. The rebellion Once Wang Ze and his followers raided the armory, Bei's prefect Zhang Deyi (ÂºµÂæó‰∏Ä) fled to the cavalry barracks, but he was captured after the rebels burned down the doors. After some fighting on the streets, Wang's followers successfully drove away general Tian Bin (Áî∞Êñå) and his cavalry from the city, then proceeded to massacre most officials that could not get away. They also released all prisoners from jail. Ma Sui was sent by Daming prefect Jia Changchao (Ë≥àÊòåÊúù) as an unarmed messenger with a letter demanding Wang Ze's surrender. During negotiations, Ma jumped and threw his cup at Wang, and attempted to strangle Wang to death with bare hands. Wang's followers then hacked off one of Ma's arms, stopping the strangulation and Ma was subsequently killed. Wang reportedly rested for many days after the scare and injury. Once order was restored, Wang proclaimed himself the King of Dongping (Êù±Âπ≥ÈÉ°Áéã), founder of a new state called Anyang (ÂÆâÈôΩ). His era name was to be \\"Desheng\\" (ÂæóËÅñ; \\"Acquiring God\\"), and a new calendar was drawn up changing the twelfth lunar month to the first month (as the rebellion happened in the twelfth lunar month). He also named Zhang Luan the chancellor and Bu Ji the commissioner of military affairs.

The film stars Kane Richmond, Stephanie Bachelor, Adele Mara, Gregory Gaye, Gerald Mohr and John Eldredge. The film was released on May 11, 1946, by Republic Pictures. Plot Tex Hanlon (Kane Richmond) is in charge of a wildly successful and mysterious advertising campaign for \\"The Three Springs\\". People everywhere are curious what the ads refer to, and even Malcolm Tauber (Gerald Mohr) the head of the company Hanlon works for, is in the dark. It's revealed that Tauber's assistant (and Hanlon's girlfriend) Gwen Hughes (Stephanie Bachelor) has created some secret sketches of women's fashion for Tex that will be used in the final Three Springs ad. However, other forces are at work. Attracted by the attention given the campaign, Renee Beauchamps (Adele Mara) asks for a chance to begin work with Hanlon. He agrees, but begins to receive threatening notes related to The Three Springs. A passing motorist, Julian Leighton (George J. Lewis), picks him up and offers him twenty-thousand dollars to spill the secret. Another wealthy man, Alexander Cardovsky (John Eldredge), also asks for information. He's later pressured by two thugs, Mr. Warren (Gregory Gaye) and Bert (Fred Graham) to reveal everything. He buys a toy puppet from a poor woman, Jenny (Donia Bussey), and finds another note in the toy, asking him to meet her. When he does, he discovers Jenny has been murdered, and he's been set up to take the blame. However, Gwen can vouch for Hanlon's whereabouts at the time of the murder. The next day Tauber is anxious to run the final Three Springs ad. He's upset when Hanlon balks, but grateful Hanlon kept The Three Springs campaign out of his conversation with the police. Hanlon tells Gwen they need to delay because he needs answers to force the criminals out in the open. Gwen convinces him otherwise and arranges to have the final proofs rushed from the printers that evening. Then Hanlon discovers that Renee has been writing the threatening notes, and she claims she'd hope to frighten him into working with her. Renee says she's being followed and must speak with him later. Gwen sees Renee kiss Hanlon goodbye and is furious. Immediately afterward, Special Detective Bates (Tom London) explains to Hanlon that the three Spring brothers, criminals who made off with millions twenty years ago and disappeared likely believe Hanlon is about to expose them. Hanlon agrees to work with Bates. Later, Gwen has forgiven Hanlon and is waiting for him at his apartment with Hanlon's \\"friends\\" Warren and Bert, not realizing who they really are. Warren and Bert threaten to pin another murder on Hanlon if he doesn't hand over his information, and Hanlon discovers they've already murdered Renee and hidden her body in the room. When Hanlon refuses to give in, Bert violently beats him. Gwen must promise to reveal the proofs of the Three Springs campaign later that evening to save Hanlon. At Hanlon's office, it's revealed that Cardovsky and Leighton are two of the Spring brothers. Hanlon believes the third brother is Warren, but at gunpoint, discovers it's Tauber. Warren had helped two of brothers escape from prison. Gwen and Bates arrive with the police to arrest all five criminals, but Bates allows Hanlon to have one last fistfight with Bert before taking Bert and his cohorts to jail.

B is called the symmetrized version of A, usually denoted A^{*}. These algorithms show up in solving the classical isoperimetric inequality problem, which asks: Given all two-dimensional shapes of a given area, which of them has the minimal perimeter (for details see Isoperimetric inequality). The conjectured answer was the disk and Steiner in 1838 showed this to be true using the Steiner symmetrization method (described below). From this many other isoperimetric problems sprung and other symmetrization algorithms. For example, Rayleigh's conjecture is that the first eigenvalue of the Dirichlet problem is minimized for the ball (see Rayleigh‚ÄìFaber‚ÄìKrahn inequality for details). Another problem is that the Newtonian capacity of a set A is minimized by A^{*} and this was proved by Polya and G. Szego (1951) using circular symmetrization (described below). Symmetrization If \\\\Omega\\\\subset \\\\mathbb{R}^n is measurable, then it is denoted by \\\\Omega^{*} the symmetrized version of \\\\Omega i.e. a ball \\\\Omega^{*}:=B_r(0)\\\\subset\\\\mathbb{R}^n such that \\\\operatorname{vol}(\\\\Omega^{*})=\\\\operatorname{vol}(\\\\Omega).

Circular symmetrization Circular symmetrization of set \\\\Omega A popular method for symmetrization in the plane is Polya's circular symmetrization.

Let \\\\Omega\\\\subset \\\\mathbb{C} be a domain; then its circular symmetrization \\\\operatorname{Circ}(\\\\Omega) with regards to the positive real axis is defined as follows: Let \\\\Omega_t:=\\\\\\\\{\\\\theta \\\\in [0,2\\\\pi]:te^{i\\\\theta}\\\\in \\\\Omega\\\\\\\\} i.e. contain the arcs of radius t contained in \\\\Omega. So it is defined * If \\\\Omega_t is the full circle, then \\\\operatorname{Circ}(\\\\Omega)\\\\cap \\\\\\\\{z=t\\\\\\\\}:=\\\\\\\\{z=t\\\\\\\\} . * If the length is m(\\\\Omega_t)=\\\\alpha, then \\\\operatorname{Circ}(\\\\Omega)\\\\cap \\\\\\\\{z=t\\\\\\\\}:=\\\\\\\\{te^{i\\\\theta}: \\\\theta<\\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{2}\\\\\\\\}. * 0,\\\\infty\\\\in \\\\operatorname{Circ}(\\\\Omega) iff 0,\\\\infty \\\\in \\\\Omega. In higher dimensions \\\\Omega\\\\subset \\\\mathbb{R}^n, its spherical symmetrization Sp^n(\\\\Omega) wrt to positive axis of x_1 is defined as follows: Let \\\\Omega_r:=\\\\\\\\{x\\\\in \\\\mathbb{S}^{n-1}: rx\\\\in \\\\Omega\\\\\\\\} i.e. contain the caps of radius r contained in \\\\Omega. Also, for the first coordinate let \\\\operatorname{angle}(x_1):=\\\\theta if x_1=rcos\\\\theta. So as above * If \\\\Omega_r is the full cap, then Sp^n(\\\\Omega)\\\\cap \\\\\\\\{z=r\\\\\\\\}:=\\\\\\\\{z=r\\\\\\\\}. * If the surface area is m_s(\\\\Omega_t)=\\\\alpha, then Sp^n(\\\\Omega)\\\\cap \\\\\\\\{z=r\\\\\\\\}:=\\\\\\\\{x:x=r and 0\\\\leq \\\\operatorname{angle}(x_1)\\\\leq \\\\theta_\\\\alpha\\\\\\\\}=:C(\\\\theta_\\\\alpha) where \\\\theta_\\\\alpha is picked so that its surface area is m_s (C(\\\\theta_\\\\alpha)=\\\\alpha. In words, C(\\\\theta_\\\\alpha) is a cap symmetric around the positive axis x_1 with the same area as the intersection \\\\Omega\\\\cap \\\\\\\\{z=r\\\\\\\\}. * 0,\\\\infty\\\\in Sp^n(\\\\Omega) iff 0,\\\\infty \\\\in \\\\Omega. Polarization Polarization of set \\\\Omega Let \\\\Omega\\\\subset\\\\mathbb{R}^n be a domain and H^{n-1}\\\\subset\\\\mathbb{R}^n be a hyperplane through the origin. Denote the reflection across that plane to the positive halfspace \\\\mathbb{H}^{+} as \\\\sigma_H or just \\\\sigma when it is clear from the context. Also, the reflected \\\\Omega across hyperplane H is defined as \\\\sigma \\\\Omega. Then, the polarized \\\\Omega is denoted as \\\\Omega^\\\\sigma and defined as follows * If x\\\\in \\\\Omega\\\\cap \\\\mathbb{H}^{+}, then x\\\\in \\\\Omega^{\\\\sigma}. * If x\\\\in \\\\Omega\\\\cap \\\\sigma(\\\\Omega) \\\\cap \\\\mathbb{H}^{-}, then x\\\\in \\\\Omega^{\\\\sigma}. * If x\\\\in (\\\\Omega\\\\setminus \\\\sigma(\\\\Omega)) \\\\cap \\\\mathbb{H}^{-}, then \\\\sigma x\\\\in \\\\Omega^{\\\\sigma}.

Sage Agasthya could not view event and prayed to Shiva at this place to get him a view of the event. Pleased by his devotion, Shiva appeared to the sage and his wife Lopamundra along with Parvathi in his marriage attire. Shiva made the place his abode and came to be called Papansanathar and the falls nearby the temple got the name of Agasthiyar as Agasthiyar Falls.

The sage established a temple for Papanasanathar and worshipped the deity here. As per another legend, the king of celestial deities, Indra slayed a demon Dwastha, the son of Sukracharya (the Guru of Asuras, the demons) as he was performing a penance to seek superior powers against the Devas. Indra incurred Brahmatti Dosha, a sin attained for slaying the Brahmin. He roamed around a lot of places for doing penance and finally on the advise of Brihaspathi, he landed at Papanasam.

Announced in November 2015, it was then expected to fly in 2019 but its development was suspended in April 2018 due to a delay in the development of its Safran Silvercrest engines. Development Announced at the 2015 National Business Aviation Association (NBAA) conference with the widest cabin in its class, it was expected to fly in 2019. Although the Snecma Silvercrest was originally selected, the process was re-opened to the Pratt & Whitney Canada PW800. The Silvercrest with over of thrust was confirmed for the 2016 NBAA Convention, along the selection of Honeywell Primus Epic cockpit and Thales Group fly-by-wire flight control system. The Silvercrest axial- centrifugal high-pressure compressor architecture is common below but rare in its range, and the pressure losses complexity at the final centrifugal stage made it slow to respond to commands in high altitude tests. This made Dassault cancel its Silvercrest-powered Falcon 5X, but the Hemisphere business case depends on it as it could lead to the best fuel efficiency in the segment. Textron is confident Safran can resolve the problems before the 2019 first flight. In April 2018, development was suspended to see how Safran manage the Silvercrest problems before a decision on its continuation is made, or to defer it or to switch to another engine. In May 2018, Safran announced it had launched a high-pressure compressor redesign for a go-ahead decision by the middle of 2019, after testing, shelving the Hemisphere program if problems cannot be fixed. The redesigned compressor will be tested in July 2019 to prove the engine operation. On October 15, 2018, fractional operator NetJets announced the purchase of up to 150 Hemispheres, priced at $35 million each, along 175 Citation Longitude, sold for $26 million.

The film's plot showcases the conflict between the working class and their employers.  Plot  Angelos, played by Nikos Kourkoulos, is the sole survivor of the sinking of the steam ship Christina. When an inquiry is set up to investigate the circumstances of the disaster, Angelos testifies that the shipping company had neglected to properly maintain the ship and due to their negligence the coal-fired boiler exploded. When the enquiry reveals the improprieties of his company, the owner played by Spyros Kalogirou takes his own life. Manos Katrakis, in the role of the owner's brother, goes after Angelos seeking revenge for the death of his brother and also because of Angelos's testimony against his company. Angelos, however, develops a plan to infiltrate the company. He is successful at romancing the owner's daughter Christina Richter, played by Mary Chronopoulou, and they get married. He is then able to run the company. However, while at the helm of the organisation he discovers that the problems that caused the sinking of the Christina are endemic and persistent within the company. Disillusioned he abandons Richter and returns to his old love Niki. In the climactic scene of the film, Angelos gets evicted from his home and his landlady throws all his belongings on the street. He puts a record on his record player, breaks an oil lantern, throws the fuel on the heap and lights up a cigarette burning his belongings in front of his neighbours, while the song of Stratos Dionysiou \\"Vrehei Fotia Stin Strata Mou\\" (It's raining fire in my way) plays in the background. Music The song \\"Vrehei Fotia Stin Strata Mou\\" (It's raining fire in my way) was composed by Mimis Plessas with lyrics by Lefteris Papadopoulos. In a subsequent interview, Papadopoulos revealed that the writer Nikos Foskolos had asked him to write a song whose lyrics included the phrase \\"Kyma pikro stin plori mou\\" (A bitter wave on my bow). The song became one of the greatest hits of Greek laiko music of the era. Mimis Plessas chose Stratos Dionysiou as the singer. The hit launched Dionysiou's career; Dionysiou does not appear in the film, but his voice is heard from a record playing the song in the background. Impact In one of the scenes of the film, while Angelos narrates the events that led to the disaster during the enquiry, he goes into an altered state and relives the scene that led to the boiler explosion. Realising that the pressure buildup, due to the malfunction of the pressure valves, would eventually lead to an explosion, he starts shouting to his shipmates not to throw any more coal to the boiler, exclaiming: Ohi allo karvouno! (No more coal! [Do not add any more coal to the ship's boiler!]). The expression Ohi allo karvouno! has since been used in Greek to describe extreme situations.  Cast  *Nikos Kourkoulos .....

He graduated from Yale College in 1842. For three years after graduation he was engaged in teaching in the public Grammar Schools in Boston, at the same time studying law. He was admitted to the bar in the autumn of 1845, and immediately went to Wisconsin Territory. He settled in the spring of 1846 in Waukesha (then Prairieville), where he resided for ten years, actively engaged in the practice of his profession. In the fall of 1852 he declined the Whig nomination for Congress in his district. He left Wisconsin in the spring of 1856, intending to settle in Selma, Alabama; but the outlook being unfavorable, he went instead to Waterbury, Connecticut, where he remained for three years, engaged in the practice of law, and a part of the time editing a weekly newspaper, as well as serving for one year as Judge of Probate. From 1859 to 1872 his residence was in New Haven, and during most of that time he was engaged in journalism; he was also Executive Secretary of Governor James E. English for three years. From 1872 to 1883 he resided in Cheshire, Conn., still engaged in literary work; here also he served for one year as Judge of Probate. From Cheshire he removed, late in 1883, to Cleveland, Ohio, where he died suddenly of congestion of the brain, January 9, 1885, at the age of 69. He contributed largely to magazines, and printed a number of poems, chiefly satirical. In 1880 he published a volume called Life; its True Genesis (12mo pp 298), which he considered to be a complete refutation of the Darwinian theory of evolution; he was preparing a continuation of this work, when stricken with his last illness.

Purpose  Republicans Abroad Norway (RAN) supports and advocates the rights of U.S. citizens residing in Norway with regards to policy, elections, voting registration among other issues. RAN also serves as a resource to the Norwegian, American, and European communities to inform and educate people about American conservative principles, policies, and philosophies. The organization often participates in the media with interviews and political debates and panels. Additionally, RAN participates in Norwegian community and charitable events.  History  Legislation that permitted constituents living abroad to vote in federal elections was signed into law by President Gerald Ford in 1975, and later updated with new legislation signed into law by President Ronald Reagan in 1986. The former prompted the Republican National Committee (RNC) to form Republicans Abroad (RA) in 1978, endeavoring to register the expatriate communities around the world, a majority of which were Republican. The 1973 oil crisis, subsequent oil crisis resulting from the overthrow of the Shah of Iran in 1979, and the Iran hostage crisis illustrated the American dependence on oil in the Middle East. This led to the focus on oil in the North Sea, a focus that attracted many American families to Norway By 1979, the founding year of RAN, there were thousands of newly arrived American expatriates living in Norway. RAN was established in Oslo by Dieter Gombert, a manager on the Statfjord development project, and held its first meeting on January 9, 1980. Dieter was quickly recruited by the RA International Board as treasurer, and RAN was relocated to Stavanger. Mike Lovelace became the new Chairman and was succeeded by Summer Kalsey in 1984. From 1981 to 1985, RAN developed programs to inform the 3,000 Americans living in Stavanger on topics ranging from political races in the United States, changes in tax laws affecting expatriates, current politics in Norway, and of course the process to register and vote in the US. Invitations were sent to U.S. political dignitaries to visit RAN in Stavanger with enticements like offshore visits to the then largest oil installations in the world. As part of the RNC, RA also attracted attention from the Reagan administration, and was recognized for securing Republican victories in some close elections. In 1985, RAN relocated back to Oslo with Ken Burton as chairman, where it has remained since. Oslo had a number of active American groups, and RAN's programs included arranging voter registration with those groups in election years, and addressing those groups about the Republican political platform. RAN was a founding organization of the American Coordinating Council of Norway, sponsoring its first Independence Day celebration in 1986. During the 1980s, Norwegian media was limited to NRK TV and radio broadcasts with Oslo at the center of political analysis. RAN found itself in a new role explaining the Republican positions of the Reagan and subsequent Republican administrations to the media and Norwegian academic and political groups. After campaign and finance laws were changed in the 1990s, the affiliation between RNC and RA, among other Republican organizations, was dissolved. At that juncture, RAN became an independent Republican organization under the umbrella of Republicans Abroad International, which later became Republicans Overseas in 2013.

Under the guidance of Archdeacon John Murphy, a design competition was run in the 1850s and won by E. W. Pugin, son of Augustus Pugin. The foundation stone was laid on 15 August 1859 and the church was dedicated for worship on 29 June 1866. Architecture The church comprises a central nave with gable roof and two aisles. The walls are of red sandstone with limestone dressing. The aisles are at either side of the nave, which is covered with a gable roof. The ridge of the roof is decorated by ornamental ironwork, partly gilt, terminated at the western gable by an ornamental cross with foliated arms. The grand altar is carved from 36 tons of Carrara marble. The pavements surrounding the altar, and the steps, are all of white Italian vein marble. The apse is decorated with blue and gold ceiling panels. The flooring of the church is in white and black marble.

He has published seven books of poetry, a critical work on the treatment of nuclear annihilation in American poetry, two co-edited volumes of literary criticism and two co-edited anthologies of contemporary poetry, as well as, a co-authored biography and guidebook on Ezra Pound's Venice. Early life and education Born in Reading, Pennsylvania, Gery is the son and fourth child of Malcolm R. Dougherty (1922-1960), a U.S. diplomat and businessman of Scotch-Irish and German descent, and Eugenie Gunesh Gery (maiden name, Guran, 1926- ), a homemaker and educator of Turkish and Russian descent. After his parents‚Äô divorce and mother's marriage to Addison H. Gery, Jr. (1923‚Äì85), a jazz musician and business executive, Gery spent his youth in the small Moravian and Pennsylvania Dutch community of Lititz, Pennsylvania. At age eight, he was legally adopted by his stepfather and had his last name changed. He attended local schools through the tenth grade, demonstrating early a propensity for writing, music and acting. For two years he attended the Lawrenceville School in New Jersey where he received his high school diploma. He received a bachelor's degree from Princeton University with Honors in English (1975), a Master's in English from the University of Chicago (1976), and a Master's in Creative Writing from Stanford University (1978). At Princeton, he studied with poets as diverse as Mark Strand, John Peck, George Garrett, and Theodore Weiss, and at Chicago he studied with Robert von Hallberg and Richard Stern. But perhaps his most influential poetry teacher was Donald Davie at Stanford, where he also worked with Kenneth Fields, Albert Gelpi, N. Scott Momaday, Diane Middlebrook and others. Writing career=Poetry Gery's poetry is heavily influenced not only by Pound, but by the avant-garde work of John Ashbery and his predecessors Gertrude Stein and Laura Riding. But he is equally engaged in the crafted technique of the Expansive Poetry Movement, and his work has sometimes been associated with the \\"New Formalist\\" movement, tracing its lineage from Richard Wilbur back through Thomas Hardy to Catullus and Sappho. Writing about The Enemies of Leisure (1995) in Louisiana Literature, Alan Golding comments that \\"the scope and delicacy\\" of Gery's work \\"in Ashberry's words, 'takes in the whole world, now, but lightly /Still lightly, but with wide authority and tact.\\" Stephen Behrendt describes Davenport's Version (2003), a book-length narrative poem set during the Union occupation of Civil War New Orleans that portrays \\"a triangular relationship that melds passion, deception, and betrayal in ways that parallel the tragic and internecine war\\" itself, as \\"a remarkable feat of poetic and psychological sleight of hand.\\" \\"The voice assigned to Davenport,\\" the poem's narrator, observes Behrendt, \\"is the sort of wise, universalized voice one associates with the narrators of epic works ranging from Homer to Whitman and Crane.\\" About Gery's collection, A Gallery of Ghosts(2008), Susan Larson notes, \\"Gery's distinctive poetic voice lends seemingly orderly poems an ironic sharpness that cuts close to the bone. These poems convey both the bliss and pain of our existence, never shying away from life's uncomfortable truths.\\" Most recently, in a review of Gery's Have at You Now! (2014), a collection he calls \\"multiple and wide-ranging,\\" Daniel Wallace writes how \\"Gery troubles his readers with doubts, failings, and deeply grounded despair\\" but in verse that \\"is in turn whimsical, comic, erotic, and nostalgic.\\" And Amy Tercek in Poet Lore observes, \\"The connection between Hamlet and Have at You Now! is most obvious in poems that examine the conflict between the activist's urge to fight and the artist's need to give form to experience\\" in what she calls a \\"beautifully staged collection.\\" Gery's poetry has appeared in Gulf Coast Review, The Iowa Review, New Orleans Review, New South, Paris Review, Poet Lore, Prairie Schooner, West Branch and many other journals, including translations into seven languages. Critical and edited works In addition to his monograph, Nuclear Annihilation and Contemporary American Poetry: Ways of Nothingness, Gery has published critical essays on contemporary poets ranging from Ashbery, Wilbur, Gwendolyn Brooks, James Merrill, and Adrienne Rich to Amiri Baraka, Lorenzo Thomas, and Marilyn Chin. In Michigan Quarterly Review, Laurence Goldstein says that ‚ÄúEducators in all fields should become better acquainted with the range of texts surveyed in Gery's book, because all the articulate wisdom in the world will be barely enough to avert the danger these poems stare at without blinking.‚Äù Most often, Gery considers the poetry he explores for its articulation of ideological, ethnic, sexual, or racial identity. But although, among the modernists, he has also written on Stein, William Carlos Williams, H.D., and Davie, his most sustained criticism has been on Pound, often discussing Pound's association with Venice in The Cantos and other poems or providing close interpretations of individual texts. In addition to co-editing two volumes of critical essays on Pound, he has co- authored In Venice and Veneto with Ezra Pound, a biographical and literary guide, with Rosella Mamoli Zorzi, Massimo Bacigalupo, and Stefano Maria Casella, and has collaborated with Vahe Baladouni on a biography of an Armenian poet of the early twentieth century in Hmayeak Shems: A Poet of Pure Spirit. Collaborative translations Gery has collaborated on translations, including from Armenian (with Vahe Baladouni), Serbian (with Biljana D. Obradoviƒá), Chinese (with Xiaobin Yang and Guiming Wang), Italian (with Caterina Ricciardi and Massimo Bacigalupo), and French (with Ivan Zaknic).

Built from 1818-1820, in Adamesque style, it is noted for its flying staircase and handcrafted woodwork. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970. History The house was built by housewright Aaron Sherman and woodcarver Alvah Peterson for Thomas Ruggles from Rochester, Massachusetts. Ruggles was a shipbuilder, sawmill owner, militia captain, postmaster, and justice of the court in Machias. His descendants owned the property until 1920, when his granddaughter Lizzie died. Mary Ruggles Chandler, Lizzie's cousin and the first licensed pharmacist in Maine, helped preserve and restore the house during the 1930s. It has been operated as a museum since 1951. Many of the furnishings originally belonged to the Ruggles family. Description The Ruggles House is located in the village center of Columbia Falls, north of the junction of Main Street and Addison Road. It is a wood frame structure, two stories in height, with a hip roof and clapboard siding. The main facade is five bays wide, with a central entrance sheltered by a hip-roof portico supported by round columns. The eave of the porch and main roof both have dentil molding. The entrance is flanked by sidelight windows and topped by an elaborate multipart semi-oval fanlight window. The interior retains high quality woodwork, including elaborate hand- carved fireplace mantels in the parlor and dining room. The showpiece of the house is its central staircase. It stands free in the center of the hall, rising to a landing where it reverses on both sides without any visible support. This type of \\"flying staircase\\" is rare, especially for a modestly- sized house.

He received his bachelor's degree at Carleton College in 1925, and divinity degree at Union Theological Seminary in 1929, followed by a year of studies at the London School of Economics. In 1933, at the age of 29 he was appointed president of Talladega College, and authored research papers on the subject of civil rights and race relations in higher education. At the time, he was believed to be the youngest college president in the country.\\"College President at 29\\" New York Times July 25, 1933 He was appointed to the job with the condition that he would pursue a doctorate during his tenure. He enrolled at Columbia University and wrote a thesis under the supervision of William H. Kilpatrick on the role of historically-black colleges in undermining racial segregation. His dissertation was revised and published as American Caste and the Negro College in 1938. He In 1944, he was hired as an instructor of Christian ethics at the Pacific School of Religion, and briefly served as an Assistant Commissioner of Education under President Harry S. Truman. Gallagher's 1946 book Color and Conscience was among the most critically antiracist books written by any white person in the 1940s. It interrogated Jim Crow and other forms of racism in light of the history of slavery and growing anti-colonial movements. In the book he wrote that ‚ÄúOur racial caste system has its historical roots in slavery, but thrusts its contemporary tentacles into every crevice and cranny of the social structure throughout the nation. Slavery as ownership of chattel is gone: as a caste system, it remains.‚Äù.Gallagher, Color and Conscience, 3 In this book he went so far as to criticize the ban on interracial marriage, something that was downplayed by antiracist activists in the era. Gallagher co-founded the South Berkeley Community Church, the first explicitly interracial church in the Bay Area, which attracted a membership of several hundred at its peak.

It aired in the United States on Fox on September 25, 2016. It's named as a parody of Monty Python's Flying Circus. This episode included references to golfer Arnold Palmer and his eponymous drink, coincidentally airing on the same day as Palmer's death at the age of 87. Plot The Simpsons go on a walk through Springfield when they see a group of people looking at the sky in terror as the Lard Lad statue has disappeared. With the police unable to do anything, the town's residents are split between rioting and not rioting, which makes the total damage from the riot $0. Soon, the Lard Lad company decides to rebrand themselves with a new chrome statue. However, the statue immediately has a major issue, as it starts reflecting sun rays into the town, burning it down almost completely. Mayor Quimby promises to rebuild the city, but with the lack of progress six months later, the Simpsons beg Mr. Burns to fund the town's reconstruction. He agrees with the condition that he can put a variety show on the Springfield Bowl. During the audition, Burns has flashbacks to when he was a child, about to go on stage for the Pee-wee Pageant of 1913 with his mother wishing him good luck. Later that day, he goes to Springfield Elementary School looking for performers for the show when he has problems opening a clasp on a clipboard. Lisa helps him and Burns decides to hire her as his personal assistant. Back at the audition, Burns has more flashbacks to his childhood presentation, showing that he was the laughingstock for everyone at the bowl and even his mother failed to comfort him. After Lisa unintentionally upsets Burns, who flashes back to the traumatic event, he decides to cancel the show. Feeling bad for Burns, Lisa gets curious about what happened to him, so Smithers shows her an old recording of his presentation, showing that his suspenders snapped in the middle of his tap-dance presentation, making his pants fall. As he went to put them back, his underwear also fell, resulting in everyone laughing at him. Later, Lisa manages to convince Burns to make the show. Meanwhile at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant with Mr. Burns gone, the employees start treating the plant as a resort complete with a pool and games. When Homer prepares for a prank, Marge reminds him that he is the safety inspector for the plant and he is the one who should be stopping that. Later, Homer manages to put the employees back to work, but some bags of popcorn that were inside the core cause a fire. At the Springfield Bowl, everything goes according to plan, but at the ending they are interrupted by what looks to be fireworks, which is later revealed to be the power plant exploding. However, Mr. Burns is not finished, as he wants to reenact his presentation, but his second try does not go any better, as he gets pushed away by a spotlight into a lamp, which causes his pants to burn down, and making him the laughingstock at the bowl once again. Burns gets mad at Lisa, but he ends up forgiving her and letting her play the saxophone on stage for an empty crowd, having finally gotten closure from his childhood incident. Lisa asks Homer why Simpsons always fail and he answers that it is because of a curse as their ancestors did not let Joseph and Mary stay at their home for Jesus' birth. Lisa disputes the validity of Homer's story. In the final scene, the Lard Lad statue is being melted in the Springfield Tire Fire and engulfs Ralph Wiggum in it. Production The couch gag for this episode is a crossover with the animated series Adventure Time, recreating its opening sequence with Simpsons characters in place of the show's usual cast, such as Bart as Finn the Human and Homer as Jake the Dog. The lyrics to the Adventure Time theme were rewritten accordingly, with series creator Pendleton Ward, who sings the original lyrics, also performing the parody version.  Reception = Critical response  \\"Monty Burns' Fleeing Circus\\" received mixed reviews from television critics. Dennis Perkins of The A.V. Club gave the episode a C commenting, \\"There‚Äôs room for audaciousness, even cruelty, in The Simpsons‚Äô comedy, if it‚Äôs earned. ‚ÄòMonty Burns‚Äô Fleeing Circus‚Äô wears its breezy brutality and laziness like a sign reading ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs just a cartoon.‚Äô But at its best, The Simpsons is a much better cartoon than this.\\" Jesse Schedeen of IGN was also very critical of the episode giving it a 4.8/10 calling it \\"Bad\\", when elaborated he wrote \\"The Simpsons' 27th season reminded us that the show can still entertain and even find moments of greatness this far removed from its golden age. However, that was only after kicking off the season with a particularly weak and unsatisfying premiere. Maybe it's going to become an annual tradition to start off poorly and work up from there? At this point I'm hoping that'll be the case. ‚ÄòMonty Burns' Fleeing Circus‚Äô wasn't as offensively bad at last year's ‚ÄòEvery Man's Dream,‚Äô but it did feature this long-running animated sitcom as its most bland and uninspired.\\" However, Tony Sokol of Den of Geek gave the episode four out of five stars stating \\"This is the reason I stuck up for Harry Shearer when he was in contract negotiations. Leave it to Mr. Burns to bring life back into The Simpsons after 28 seasons. The old, old man has more life in him than Satan itself. So it makes perfect sense that the lowly residents of Evergreen Terrace make a contract with him to rebuild the town after the devastating unveiling of the new Lard Lad billboard. And breathe new life he does. This season‚Äôs opener seems fresh. Maybe as fresh as season 20, but who‚Äôs counting? From the very opening, which puts an Adventure Time spin on Springfield...'Monty Burns Fleeing Circus' is a full variety show, the likes of hasn‚Äôt been seen since about aught nine. Or at least the Pee Wee Pageant of 1913. The voice acting is superb. I especially like how the entire Simpson family reassures Burnsy that his trap door system was indeed unexpected and, really quite frightening.\\" Ratings \\"Monty Burns Fleeing Circus\\" scored a 1.4 rating with a 5 share and was watched by 3.36 million people making The Simpsons Fox's highest rated show of the night.

The Otas were also contracted to teach these classes by several schools and organizations over the years, including the Junior League of Santa Barbara. The popularity of their classes grew such that they built the Cultural School on the same property of their Goleta home. Ken Ota also taught ballroom classes at UC Santa Barbara for credit as well as through the leisure arts program; students would regularly host off-site social dances at the Ota's Cultural School to put their skills into practice. Over the years, various social and competitive dance clubs have been formed and used the Cultural School as their preferred venue for off-site events.

He first made a one-episode stint on 21 December 2000 before reappearing as a regular cast member and gradually the show's main antagonist from 17 April 2001 to his last appearance on 1 November 2002. The character was introduced as the estranged husband of Little Mo Slater (Kacey Ainsworth), whom he had domestically abused and mistreated throughout most of his duration on the series. This escalates up to the point where he rapes Little Mo and, after attempting to do so again on New Year's Eve 2001, ends up having her wrongfully imprisoned for attacking him with an iron in self- defense that night. During that time, Trevor frequently clashes with Little Mo's family and proceeds to spark a feud with both her sister Kat (Jessie Wallace) and love interest Billy Mitchell (Perry Fenwick). After Trevor is set-up into having Little Mo released from prison, his story arc concludes with the character attempting to kill his wife and son Sean by setting fire to their house on Halloween Night 2002; however, they are rescued by their neighbour Tom Banks (Colm √ì Maonla√≠) and Trevor is consequently killed alongside Tom when the building explodes just before the pair could escape as well. Storylines Trevor Morgan first arrived in Albert Square ‚Äî the local community of Walford, a fictionalized borough in East London ‚Äî along with his wife Little Mo Slater (Kacey Ainsworth) around December 2000 to celebrate Christmas with her family. It soon transpired that their marriage was previously troubled due to Trevor's domestic abuse towards his wife, though she agreed to reconcile with him following a period of separation between them. Trevor promises to cease his violence towards her, but soon resumes his abuse ‚Äî often beating and mistreating her. By September 2001, he and Little Mo are living in the B&B; in Albert Square. He is regularly apologetic after attacking her, but continues to isolate her from her family; with her sister Kat (Jessie Wallace) being particularly resentful over the situation. After months of talk about Trevor's treatment of Little Mo, he is finally seeing being violent towards her in October 2001 ‚Äî after suspecting that there was friction within Little Mo's family and she refused to tell him what was happening. He then burnt her with an iron, and a few days later managed to intimidate her into admitting that Kat's younger sister Zoe (Michelle Ryan) was actually her daughter ‚Äî as a result of Kat being sexually abused by their uncle Harry Slater (Michael Elphick) when she was a teenager. When Trevor discovers Little Mo plans to join Kat in helping their sister Lynne Hobbs (Elaine Lordan) celebrate her wedding in late 2001, even though she agreed not to do that on his behalf earlier on, he rapes her as a punishment. When she arrives late for Christmas dinner, he pushes her face into her plate and forces her to eat the remains from the carpet. Hours later, he beats Little Mo up after discovering her contraceptive pills which she had secretly been taking in order to avoid becoming pregnant by him. Little Mo's family constantly implore her to leave her husband, despising his treatment of her. Trevor frequently rows with Kat, and is attacked by her father Charlie (Derek Martin) when he learns that Trevor burned Little Mo's hand with an iron. When Little Mo finally leaves Trevor just after Christmas 2001, when she discovers he deleted a message from Zoe, he tries to win her back. She resists and he becomes violent, attempting to rape her again. Little Mo hits Trevor over the head with an iron in self-defence, knocking him unconscious. Little Mo believes she has killed him, but when she and her family return to dispose of Trevor's body, they find out he has gone. Trevor, meanwhile, is admitted to hospital and when he recovers he reports Little Mo to the police and has her charged with attempted murder, although she is released on bail until the trial in April 2002. Despite strong evidence of domestic violence, corroborated by Trevor's mistress Donna Andrews (Paula Jennings), the mother of his baby son, Sean, the jury at her trial find Little Mo guilty of attempted murder and she is sentenced to eight years in prison. Following Little Mo's imprisonment, Donna ends up in hospital as a result of Trevor's abuse. Kat cares for Sean, but Trevor arrives at the Slater family home, determined to take his son. When Kat stands in his way, Trevor attacks her, knocking her to the ground. The police arrive and arrest him, but Trevor makes a deal with Kat, agreeing to retract his statement against Little Mo in return for Kat not pressing charges against him. Little Mo is subsequently released from prison on appeal and she soon begins dating Trevor's love rival Billy Mitchell (Perry Fenwick). Unable to accept this, Trevor attempts to win Little Mo back and is nice to her both in private and in public but Mo rebuffs his attempts to get close to her. He resorts to dating Billy's cousin Sam (Kim Medcalf) ‚Äî only to be later dumped when she finds out about his true colors. Mo is happy when Trevor announces he's moving to Glasgow and she agrees to have a goodbye drink with him in the Vic. But he deliberately leaves his plane ticket behind so Mo will find them and return them to him. However once he has her in his room, he reveals the ticket is hers and that she's coming with him. He tells her she's never going to be free of him and he threatens to kill her if she attempts to marry Billy. Trevor starts to stalk Little Mo and breaks into her and Billy's house when he thinks she's by herself. He tries to scare her into calling off the divorce but Billy and Paul stop him, having baited him to enter the house. Finally Trevor is outcasted by the whole of Walford and he walks into the pub to see Mo has accepted Billy's marriage proposal. Billy offers him a drink to see him off, and he says 'To whatever the future may hold' before leaving. Seemingly free of Trevor, Billy and Little Mo celebrate their engagement at Angie's Den. But Trevor returns, enters the party in a costume and grabs Little Mo. Taking her and his son hostage in the Slater family home he attempts to kill them all in a house fire, but Little Mo stands up to Trevor by saying she is not frightened of him. He had already tracked his former mistress Donna down to her new address in Swindon, having beaten her up and snatched their son before heading back to Walford. He threatens to start the fire but she lights the match saying he does not have the guts. He grabs Little Mo, causing the match to drop and a fire to start. Little Mo and Sean are rescued by her neighbour Tom Banks (Colm √ì Maonla√≠); however, when going back for Trevor, both men are killed when the house explodes. Little Mo begins to plan a funeral for Trevor, but is convinced by Donna that she should be mourning Tom instead. This leads to Little Mo's family, including Billy, being angered at Little Mo after all the treatment Trevor has given her. However, when she attempts to get rid of his ashes, she says to Kat that she does not want to scatter them, as it is an act of remembrance and does not want to remember him, which makes Kat proud of her sister. Later on, she tells Billy in the caf√©, that she saw a new chapter of her life and the doors to her previous one closing when the curtains closed on the coffin. Development In her book Media and violence: gendering the debates, Karen Boyle states that Trevor's introduction to EastEnders follows a theme in British soap operas whereby abusive characters are never completely integrated into the soap community. Trevor's first appearance in EastEnders occurs months after the introduction of the core Slater family, and he is never given a permanent home on Albert Square. Boyle observes that Trevor's status as an outsider means that he is also expelled from the community with relative ease, and that there is \\"a whiff of divine justice\\" about his eventual death. Preview. In Social issues in television fiction, Lesley Henderson furthers the assessment of Trevor as an outsider with the observation that he was one of very few Scottish characters in the soap's history, and the sole Scottish character at the time. Ferns was surprised by the storyline which saw Trevor rape Little Mo, opining that EastEnders executive producer John Yorke \\"really put his neck on the line by doing it.\\" He found the rape and Christmas attack the most difficult scenes of his career, but found Trevor easier to play as he gained a better psychological understanding of the character. Ainsworth found the Christmas scenes equally difficult, and told Cosmopolitan magazine: \\"Even though I'm an actress, at that point when I was on the floor, I felt totally and utterly humiliated and sick. I felt Little Mo's degradation at having her head shoved into a plate of food. What was more frightening was I knew this scene could have been real, that it's all part of the power game these men play to make women feel as if they're worthless.\\" At one time, Ferns considered leaving the acting profession to become a counsellor, but felt that he was prevented from doing so by Trevor's high profile, explaining: \\"It's difficult enough for people who are grieving without Trevor walking in.\\" Reception Ferns won six awards for his portrayal of Trevor, and was nominated for a further four. In 2002, he was named \\"Most Hated Soap Villain\\" by readers of What's On TV magazine, with 21% of the votes. He won \\"Best Newcomer\\" and \\"Villain of the Year\\" at the 2002 British Soap Awards, \\"Best Actor\\" at the 2002 Inside Soap Awards, and both \\"Best Soap Newcomer\\" and \\"Best Soap Storyline\\" for Trevor's abuse of Little Mo at the 2002 TV Quick and TV Choice Awards. He was also nominated \\"Most Popular Actor\\" at the 2002 National Television Awards, and \\"Best Actor\\", \\"Villain of the Year\\" and \\"Best Storyline\\", again for Trevor's abuse of Little Mo, at the 2003 British Soap Awards. Karen Price of the Western Mail wrote in 2008 that Ferns as Trevor had \\"some of the most dramatic scenes in the history of EastEnders\\". The domestic abuse storyline received critical commendation for its \\"sensitive account\\" of sexual violence, however was also condemned for \\"symbolising the descent of popular television into distressing and inappropriate material.\\" Boyle gave the storyline a mixed review, writing that Little Mo's attempted murder conviction served to highlight the inequities of the legal system, yet undermined \\"the more mundane, persistent realities of domestic violence that the soap ‚Äì patterned on repetition and the deferral of closure ‚Äì is otherwise well positioned to deal with.\\" In 2012, Digital Spy listed Trevor as one of the \\"scariest TV characters of all time\\", saying he \\"gave plenty of soaps fans nightmares.\\" The episode in which Trevor attacked Little Mo over Christmas dinner was watched by 14.5 million viewers, and voted 57th in Channel 4's 100 Greatest Scary Moments. The storyline attracted so many complaints from the public that the Broadcasting Standards Commission undertook their first study of sex and violence in soap operas in twenty years. The Commission ruled that the Christmas episode, as well as the New Year's Eve 2001 episode in which Little Mo retaliated by attacking Trevor with an iron, should not have been broadcast before the 9 pm watershed. It was felt that the latter episode had a \\"stark and graphic quality unsuitable for pre- watershed transmission\\", and while the BSC stated that scenes of domestic abuse were permissible, there were \\"concern[s] about the intense, disturbing and protracted nature of the scenes portraying Trevor's attacks on Mo\\". A spokesperson for the BBC defended the scenes as \\"developments in well- established storylines\\". They claimed the depiction of abuse was consistent for the series, and that EastEnders viewers expected that seasonal episodes such as Christmas and New Year would always be \\"overshadowed by crises\\". Ferns received a death threat whilst working on EastEnders, believed by police to have been sent from a \\"crazed fan\\". He was told to take extra security precautions, including leaving the EastEnders set via the back exit, and not travelling alone. Ferns was surprised by the strength of reactions to his role, and assessed that it was because of the domestic abuse: \\"You can have violence on screen and it's kind of an everyday thing but there's something about a man hitting a woman, within the confines of their own home, that people find hard to take.\\" The aggression directed at him by members of the public intensified following Little Mo's imprisonment, forcing Ferns to wear a disguise when travelling on the London Underground.

During his time there, he was given the task of introducing the soap's fourth weekly episode. He axed the majority of the Di Marco family, and helped introduce popular characters such as the Slater family. As what Mal Young described as \\"two of EastEnders most successful years\\", Yorke was responsible for big ratings winners such as \\"Who Shot Phil?\\", Ethel Skinner's death, Jim Branning and Dot Cotton's marriage, abusive Trevor Morgan, and Kat Slater's revelation to her daughter Zoe that she was her mother. Yorke was also responsible for Kim Medcalf being cast in the role of Sam Mitchell in January 2002, after Danniella Westbrook's drug addiction left her unsuitable for the role.

Return to EastEnders In June 2017, it was announced that EastEnders executive producer Sean O'Connor had stepped down and would be temporarily replaced by Yorke as executive consultant. Yorke announced that he would be staying with the show for a year, longer than his original three months he was contracted to. Into The Woods Outside of television production, Yorke also authored Into The Woods: A Five-Act Journey Into Story, a writing guide that proposed a five act structure to film and television narrative, tying it back into classical mythology and playwriting techniques. The book draws extensively from Yorke's own research and experience, using examples from projects such as EastEnders and Spooks. This is used as the basis for seminars and online classes, devised and taught by Yorke.

It is used by biological anthropologists to, in a standardized and consistent way, document data relevant to research and forensic applications of human skeletal remains. It has influenced other skeletal recording software, and has been successfully used at the Smithsonian for collecting data relevant to biological anthropology. Osteoware is the only free, individual-use software for the collection of data on skeletal material in anthropology.  Uses  When analyzing a skeletal population or individual, ranging from metric analyses to taphonomic and pathological analyses, the biological anthropologist collects various data. Osteoware is beneficial in that it organizes the range of data collected into a universal format, which is of further use to anthropologists when they need to interpret their data. If, for instance, the focus of the anthropologist's research is the dentition of the remains, Osteoware has an inventory for both deciduous and permanent (or adult) dentition. Osteoware is also particularly useful for archaeological sites or disaster sites that have commingled remains. One major challenge with commingled remains is how to document and organize the data associated with the commingling. Osteoware has two primary features that remedy this difficulty. On the home page, there is a button to add individuals associated with the main individual whose data are being collected; and there is another button that is useful when there is no main individual in the commingling or when one is unable to associate other remains with a specified individual.  Software features  Within the program, there are twelve modules where one can manually insert qualitative or quantitative data. These sections include: Skeletal Inventory, Pathology, Taphonomy, Dental Morphology and Inventory, Age and Sex, Cranial and Postcranial Metrics, Cranial Nonmetrics, Macromorphoscopics and Cranial Deformations. The module buttons are color coded in relation to the status of the data, for example the button is yellow if data is required and purple when it has been provided. Integrating photographs, X-ray data, and commingled bone documentation is also possible with this software through four special function buttons. Regarding the radiographic and X-ray data, Osteoware provides a \\"Pending\\" option prior to completion of these kind of data. Whenever the data entry is complete within Osteoware, a module for the Summary Paragraph is provided. This provides an opportunity to provide additional information, as well as summarize the data collected. To make this module easier, Osteoware has a function where comments from other modules can be inserted within the Summary Paragraph. The software is primarily Windows compatible, but users of Mac OS 10.5 and higher can use it if they install BootCamp -- software that enables switching between Windows and Mac environments. It is also possible to extract data from Osteoware because it operates with a 'relational database', SQL.  Members  The Osteoware project team has in the past consisted of (in alphabetical order): Kathleen Aida, formerly of the Repatriation Osteology Laboratory; Chris Dudar, director of the Repatriation Office Osteology Laboratory; Joseph Hefner from Michigan State University; Erica Jones, of the Repatriation Osteology Laboratory; Gwyn Madden, from the Department of Anthropology, Grand Valley State University; Dawn Mulhern from the Department of Anthropology, Fort Lewis College; Claire O'Brien, formerly of the Repatriation Osteology Laboratory; Steve Ousley from the Department of Anthropology, Mercyhurst College; and Cynthia Wilczak from the Department of Anthropology San Francisco State University.  History  After the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) was passed as a federal law in 1990, efforts were made in the field of biological anthropology to provide better documentation of skeletal remains. The Smithsonian does not fall under NAGPRA, but falls under the National Museum of the American Indian Act (NMAIA). Prior to the passing of NAGPRA, the NMAIA was passed by the U.S. Congress in 1989. This act is similar to NAGPRA, in that it requires the repatriation of Native American skeletal remains and spiritually significant artifacts to the tribes to which they belong. Osteoware grew out of these efforts. After Buikstra and Ubelaker's Standards for Data Collection from Human Skeletal Remains was published and began to be used by biological anthropologists as a field and data collection manual, the Smithsonian deemed it necessary to create a digital data entry system that was modeled after the work of these authors.Killgrove, K. 2013. Bioarchaeology. In: Oxford Bibliographies Online ‚Äì Anthropology, J.L. Jackson, Jr., ed. OxfordUniversity Press.  Criticism  Beside the buttons for adding individuals and for commingled inventories, one can use the database tracking system for commingled skeletal elements. This system is useful for keeping track of commingled remains during data collection and for future efforts at reassociation. The type of method and the time to use it when documenting commingled remains is not decided by the software, but by the individual entering the data. It is therefore difficult to discern when to identify which feature to use. Osteoware also does not provide an option for 'Unknown' for the siding of a bone and it also does not incorporate provenience. Cargill, Grant, Oubre, and Danforth suggest that these two options would be beneficial additions to Osteoware. The Smithsonian has created a forum where users can offer criticisms and potential suggestions to improve Osteoware as a data collection tool. Currently, Osteoware is expanding its Taphonomy module to include the documentation of peri- and postmortem cut marks as well as partial versus complete cremation. Osteoware is also expanding beyond framework of Buikstra and Ubelaker's Standards for Data Collection from Human Skeletal Remains to include Postcranial Nonmetric Traits.

Sandra di Marco Sandra di Marco, played by Clare Wilkie, is the estranged wife of Beppe di Marco (Michael Greco), and mother of his son Joe (Jake Kyprianou). She had walked out on the family when Joe was just one year old. Sandra reappears in Beppe and Joe's lives in 2000 when she tracks them down to Walford. She had left them because Beppe's family, and in particular his grandparents Bruno and Luisa (Leon Lissek and Stella Tanner), resented her for not being Italian. Sandra wanted to go back to work after having Joe, but the family would not allow it, and when Beppe started siding with his family on the issue, Sandra decided to leave him and her son. She later moved in with Beppe's police partner, Jack Robbins (Chook Sibtain). She left Jack to track down her son, and although she is met with hostility at first, she and Beppe soon grow closer and eventually rekindle their romance, much to the disgust of Beppe's family. Beppe is still in love with Sandra and soon begins pressurising her to have more children. The suggestion is met with hostility and she flatly refuses. Soon after, Jack arrives in Albert Square looking for Sandra. It turns out that Sandra had left Jack, following a miscarriage that left her unable to have children. Sandra tries to deny her feelings for Jack, but eventually she admits that she is still in love with him and has only reconciled with Beppe so she can get custody of her son. She and Jack reignite their romance, and Sandra makes plans to flee Walford with Jack and Joe. However, Beppe catches them just as they are about to leave and when he realises what is going on, he attacks Jack, takes Joe back and denies Sandra any access. Sandra and Jack subsequently threaten to take Beppe to court for custody of Joe. Beppe retaliates by using his police contacts to plant drugs on Jack, getting him sacked from the force. The constant rowing is having a negative effect on Joe and he finds it difficult to choose between his warring parents. This culminates in him getting hit by a car when he disobeys his father and runs across the road to be with his mother. Joe is not seriously hurt, but the accident makes his parents rethink their behaviour. Beppe eventually allows Sandra visitation rights, and so she leaves Walford with Jack. Laura Beale Laura Beale, played by Hannah Waterman, is employed by local businessman Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) as a nanny for his children, Peter (Joseph Shade), Lucy (Casey Anne Rothery) and Steven Beale (Edward Savage). The two eventually become a couple, but when Laura announces that she wants a baby, Ian has a secret vasectomy. When Laura becomes pregnant, Ian throws her out, believing that the baby cannot be his.

When Jim sees her, he quickly grabs Dot Cotton (June Brown) and kisses her. Dot slaps Jim, but after Maureen sees them kissing, she quickly leaves Walford. Rod Morris Forbes Masson portrays Rod Morris. Rod Morris, played by Forbes Masson, is the tutor of Nicky di Marco (Carly Hillman) who had been contacted by her mother Rosa (Louise Jameson) to help Nicky study for her exams.

Rod tells Nicky she has caught up enough and they can end the lessons. Nicky desperately tries to convince Rosa to have a word with Rod to get him to change his mind. Rod and his wife Fiona (Ashley Jensen) come to the di Marcos for dinner and it is obvious to Fiona that Nicky has a crush on her husband. Nicky finally makes a move on her tutor and he initially reciprocates, but then takes things too far and sexually assaults her.

She tries to defend her actions by saying her husband left her to bring up two children with no money. She refuses to let Steve call an ambulance and asks him to kiss her. He gives her a peck on the forehead but she asks for a kiss on the lips. When he leans forward, she grabs him and gives him an extremely passionate kiss, telling him he is an attractive man. Steve is disgusted and leaves. Barbara dies soon after. Mel is the only person in attendance at Barbara's funeral, while Steve is having sex with another woman. When Steve dies in a car explosion eight months after Barbara's death, his ashes are dumped on Barbara's grave by Phil. Seventeen years after Barbara's death, Mel returns to Walford with her and Steve's son, Hunter Owen (Charlie Winter), who learns that Steve was a villain.

Pauline Fowler (Wendy Richard), Martin's mother, demands to be part of Rebecca's life, causing upset. Sonia is furious when she discovers Pauline and Martin have been seeing her daughter behind her back. Eventually Sonia gives into her urges and grows closer to Rebecca too. Margaret decides to make Sonia and Martin Rebecca's legal guardians in case anything happens to her, unaware that Sonia and Martin have separated due to Sonia's lesbian adultery. Sonia persuades Martin not to tell Margaret that they have split up, but when the truth comes out, Margaret is furious and refuses to give Sonia guardianship of Rebecca. When Margaret has a fall and dies, Rebecca is given to Martin and Pauline refuses Sonia access, causing many rows. Sonia and Martin reunite in December 2006. On Christmas Day 2006, Pauline dies just before emigrating to America. Rebecca saw Sonia slap Pauline before her death and believes that Sonia killed Pauline.

In March 2015, Rebecca, tired of strife between her parents, enters a rebellious phase of her life. She adopts a goth fashion style and insists on being referred to by her former name, Chloe, before deciding to go by Bex. Bex rejects Sonia as she has been living away from them, and they become further estranged when Martin (now Bye) reveals Sonia is having a lesbian relationship with Tina Carter (Luisa Bradshaw-White). Martin, realising the situation may be his own fault, decides to have Bex live with Sonia, reasoning that she needs to spend more time with her mother. Martin starts a relationship with Stacey Branning (Lacey Turner) and moves in with her and her daughter Lily Branning (Aine Garvey). Martin plans to propose to Stacey and Bex gives him her blessing but is glad when they decide not to marry. Stacey gives birth to a son, Arthur Fowler, although unbeknownst to Martin, Arthur is not his son. When Stacey is diagnosed with and sectioned due to postpartum psychosis, Bex realises Martin is struggling with Arthur, Lily and work, so she draws him up a schedule. She accompanies Martin on a visit to the hospital to see Stacey. When Martin learns the truth about Arthur's paternity, he goes to stay with his sister Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully) in America and when he returns, he intends to leave for good. Martin then reveals that Kush Kazemi (Davood Ghadami) is Arthur's father to everyone in the pub, including Bex.

Bex tells Linzi's mother, Thelma Bragg (Lorraine Stanley) about the relationship, and points out Jay to her when she demands to know who has been having sex with Linzi. Although Jay has not had sex with Linzi, Bex states that Thelma's accusations are true. Jay is arrested and Bex is interviewed by police. After Bex tells Sonia that she has had sex, Sonia, Sharon Mitchell (Letitia Dean) and Honey Mitchell (Emma Barton), talk to her and Louise about the pressures and consequences of sex, but Bex reveals that she has not had sex. When Sonia finds a lump in her breast, she tells Bex, who fears that Sonia has cancer, but it turns out to be a cyst. Bex has a crush on newcomer Shakil Kazemi (Shaheen Jafargholi) and is jealous when Louise flirts with him. At Martin and Stacey's reception, Bex and Shakil kiss, seen by a jealous Louise. Martin struggles to accept Bex dating, and after disputes between Martin and Shakil, Sonia gets them to make amends for Bex's sake. Tina's mother Sylvie Carter (Linda Marlowe) later moves in with Sonia and Tina, but Bex does not cope looking after her when Sonia and Tina are not around. Bex is stunned when Shakil tells her he wants to have sex with her. Bex tells him that she is not ready for sex and she talks about it with Louise, who tells her Shakil will not wait for long. After taking advice from Louise, Bex decides to change her appearance. Bex confides in Stacey about Shakil wanting to have sex, who mentions this to Martin; Martin interrupts Shakil's party, but later apologises to Bex. Sonia is offered a job in Kettering and Martin and Stacey agree for Bex to live with them. Bex is angry and upset with Sonia and refuses to say goodbye, but Tina arranges for them to talk. Bex is upset and Shakil comforts her. Bex moves in with Martin and Stacey, but struggles to cope with the overcrowding until they move into Sonia's old house. When Bex discovers Shakil has bought condoms, she cancels her 16th birthday party to avoid him. Stacey advises Bex to tell Shakil how she feels. When the pair are alone in Bex's room, she stops him from going further than kissing, so he calls her frigid. However, Shakil apologises to Bex and she forgives him. Bex finds out from Louise and Shakil that people are talking about her relationship and about her and Shakil not having sex. Shakil suggests to Bex they send explicit photos of themselves to each other instead of sex. After talking with Louise and Tina, Bex decides to take an explicit photo. She tells Louise she has not sent the photo and thinks Shakil is not interested in her when he ignores her. Bex confronts Shakil about his ignoring her and Bex admits to Shakil that she did not want to break the law and feared the photos being shared, but apologises for hurting his feelings. Bex then tells Shakil she wants to have sex with him and they try to arrange a place and time that they can be alone. Bex goes round to Shakil's whilst his mother Carmel Kazemi (Bonnie Langford) and brother Kush are out and they have sex. Immediately afterwards, Shakil sees Bex and Louise talking and assumes Bex is telling Louise about it, so he ignores Bex and refuses to tell her if they are still together. Bex asks Stacey how to know if you're having sex right and explains how Shakil is behaving towards her. Bex is upset when Shakil changes his online status to single. An upset Bex tells Stacey she has been dumped, who tells Martin and she is left embarrassed when Martin publicly has a go at Shakil. Martin's aunt and godmother, Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth) tries to justify his actions, but Bex refuses to forgive Martin or Stacey until she watches Shakil kiss Louise as part of the Christmas play. Bex shows Louise a prospectus for a college after deciding she needs a fresh start but decides to stay at her school's 6th form to study A-Levels. Keegan Baker (Zack Morris) insults Bex and she finds out Shakil was one of the boys who teased Louise with Keegan and warns him to stay away from her. When the school closes early, Bex, Louise, Shakil and Keegan take a bus home, but the driver suffers a heart attack and drives through the market and into the viaduct. The students are trapped but escape through the emergency exit. Bex is upset to learn Martin is trapped under the bus, but everyone works together to get him out. Bex stops Louise from truanting after being teased over a video posted online by Keegan of the bus crash and Louise gets Bex to promise that she will not resume her relationship with Shakil. Convinced that Shakil is encouraging Keegan, Louise gets Bex's phone and sends Shakil's naked photo to her friends Alexandra D'Costa (Sydney Craven) and Madison Drake (Seraphina Beh) and Bex is left distressed when she finds out what Louise did and that the photo has been sent to another person. Bex remains angry with Louise, Madison and Alexandra for the way they have treated Shakil and is hurt when Shakil tells her she can \\"drop dead\\". On Valentine's Day, Bex receives a card and believes Shakil sent it, however, she realises Louise, Madison and Alexandra played a prank on her. Shakil tells Louise that he has seen Bex and Travis together and Madison and Alexandra tell Louise they believe Bex has been after Travis for a while, but when Louise confronts Bex, she insists they are just friends. Bex takes a liking to Preston Cooper (Martin Anzor), a student from the United States with whom her aunt Michelle (now played by Jenna Russell) had an illegal relationship. Preston encourages Bex to skip school and Preston gets Michelle to Sharon's house, where he is in bed with Bex, and Michelle realises Preston is using Bex to make her jealous. After finding out Bex had sex with Preston, Madison and Alexandra spread the fact, and Keegan and Shakil find out. Keegan suggests to Shakil they should get revenge on Bex, and Keegan imposes Bex's face on a porn video and spreads it around. Bex is humiliated when Martin sees the video. Bex and Martin meet with one of Bex's teachers, where Bex refuses to name anyone involved and they are told it is being passed onto the police as it is treated as an image of child abuse. Martin is called into school and is informed about Shakil's explicit photo. Bex takes the blame for sending it and she and Martin are told Bex will be interviewed under caution by the police the following day because she has distributed an indecent image of a child. Bex overhears Martin talking negatively about her to Stacey. When she tells Louise that she will admit the truth, Louise confesses that Madison and Alexandra were responsible for sending the photo and she should think about bringing them into it. Bex is cautioned and tells Louise, Madison and Alexandra she took the blame despite being the only innocent person, and they laugh at her. The police and social services visit Bex, Martin and Stacey to ask about explicit photos Bex took of herself. Although Bex thought she had deleted the photos and had not sent them on, they had been backed up automatically. Bex is told she can return to school, but when Martin returns her phone, she only receives abuse so decides to do an apprenticeship, which Martin disagrees with her doing. Kush persuades Bex to return to school and not let what is happening ruin her life. Madison and Alexandra overhear Bex insult them when she confronts Louise over their friendship. In the toilets, Madison and Alexandra push Bex, tear her shirt and write on her face whilst Louise stands outside, worried about Bex but feeling unable to help. She admits to teachers Mrs Robyn Lund (Polly Highton) and Mr Gethyn Price (Cerith Flinn) that Louise, Madison and Alexandra were responsible for her attack and sending the photo, but Louise, Madison and Alexandra deny knowledge of either incidents and Bex ends her friendship with Louise, but Linzi offers her support. When Preston returns from Manchester, he and Bex become a couple. Louise finds out that Michelle and Preston are having an affair so tells Bex, who refuses to believe it until she sees Preston touching Michelle and Michelle flinching, so publicly demands to know if Michelle is having sex with her boyfriend. Preston apologises to Bex and admits he loves Michelle. Stacey and Whitney Carter (Shona McGarty) stick up for Bex, ordering Preston to leave. While trying to find Preston, Michelle crashes a car into the chip shop after taking sleeping pills with alcohol. After this, Preston returns to America after being convinced that Michelle does not need him; Bex is glad that he has gone. Michelle tries to make amends with Bex, who reminds Michelle of what she has lost. Bex works alongside Michelle at the caf√© and she snaps at Michelle when Madison and Alexandra make remarks about them and Preston. Bex goes busking but almost backs out when she sees a group of girls laughing. Shakil persuades her to carry on, but she is stopped by Martin. When Alexandra sees Bex in the local shop, she knocks the sugar she is buying out of her hands and sticks chewing gum in her hair when she goes to pick it up. Later, Bex goes to the caf√© where Kathy asks her to serve Alexandra and Madison their drinks. They insult her and Alexandra trips Bex, causing Kathy to spill soup on Madison. They later warn Bex that she can never escape them, and gain access to Bex's home by telling Stacey they are her friends and they smash her guitar. Bex is then tricked by them into putting mud covered in chocolate in her mouth, which the film and tell her it is cat faeces. Bex sees the video of this online and calls Sonia in tears, who returns to Walford and announces that she wants Bex to live with her. Sonia also visits Bex's school but does not mention Louise is part of the bullying when Bex asks her not to, which gives Louise hope that they can be friends again. After Michelle and Sharon get them talking, Louise agrees not to be friends with Alexandra and Madison, but in front of Bex she tells them she is not friends with Bex again, so Bex walks off in anger. Unknown to Louise, Madison and Alexandra plan to take revenge on her because they blame her for being reported to the school. Bex overhears Madison and Alexandra inviting Travis to a party at Louise's home, which Louise believes will just be for the three girls. Bex tries to warn Louise that they cannot be trusted but Louise accuses her of being jealous because she has no friends of her own. Travis leaves Louise's party and tells Bex that Louise needs her. After Louise gets drunk and is sick, she staggers outside, coughs up blood and collapses, panicking Bex, Madison, Alexandra, Keegan, Travis and Dennis, who are watching. Louise is taken to hospital with paralysis and Sharon tells Louise about Bex finding her. When Louise is sent home, she invites Bex round, but Madison and Alexandra turn up so Bex does not go to Louise's house. After speaking to Dennis about the party on Travis's behalf, Bex tells Louise that Alexandra followed Travis into the kitchen and Alexandra interrupts them. Alexandra gets herself out of trouble by telling Louise and Bex that Travis may not have been responsible for spiking her drink and Louise insists that Madison and Alexandra are still her friends. Bex hears a rumour that Louise had sex with Keegan at the party, so she tells her to take a pregnancy test, but Martin catches Bex purchasing the test for Louise and wrongly assumes it is for herself. Bex is delighted when she learns Stacey and Martin are having a baby. Sonia returns from Kettering and wants Bex to move in with her and her brother, Robbie Jackson (Dean Gaffney) and Dot, however, Bex wants to remain with Martin and Stacey. Alexandra decides she will take revenge on Bex when she overhears Bex smugly telling Travis that Alexandra will mess up in the showcase. Before Bex's performance at the showcase, Madison and Alexandra break a guitar string and when Bex looks for one in a classroom, Madison and Alexandra pin Bex up against a wall. Shakil hears the bullying through headphones and exposes it through the soundboard. Bex is found locked in the cupboard and she is encouraged to perform following her ordeal. Bex and Louise make amends and Bex decides to go the prom with Shakil. At the prom, Louise suffers burns after being pushed onto lit candles by Alexandra and Madison, leading to their arrests. Bex visits Louise in hospital but her mother, Lisa Fowler (Lucy Benjamin), says Louise wants no visitors and Lisa tells Bex her plans for Louise if she was well. Louise is distressed when Lisa and Bex arrange for Travis to visit her. Bex receives her GCSE results and is disappointed that she gained a D in music, so Sonia contacts Gethin about Bex's result and Gethin agrees to tutor Bex. Following a gas explosion, Bex tends to Gethin's wounds and they kiss. Bex apologises but Gethin reassures her, however, he says he can no longer tutor her and says a relationship would be illegal due to the fact he is her teacher and insists he has no feelings for her. Bex attempts to make Gethin jealous by flirting with Shakil and Gethin asks her to stop her behaviour and he later kisses Sonia, watched by Bex. When Bex claims to have a new boyfriend, Gethin starts tutoring her again. Bex continues to pursue him but he insists nothing can happen, and Louise asks Bex not to chase Gethin. However, Bex tries to get Gethin to admit he likes her, but he goes through with telling Sonia that Bex kissed him. Sonia is furious that the kiss happened weeks ago and throws Gethin out. She asks Bex for the whole truth and Bex insists it was just a kiss and asks Sonia not to report Gethin. Gethin gets drunk and Bex's great- uncle, Jack Branning (Scott Maslen), Gethin's landlord, evicts Gethin when he finds out about the kiss. Gethin then leaves Walford. Louise accidentally tells Shakil about Bex and Gethin, and Bex is heartbroken when Shakil kisses Louise, though Louise is stunned and disgusted by Shakil's immaturity. Bex is devastated when Shakil is stabbed and killed in a knife attack in May 2018. The following year, overwhelmed by the prospect of going to Oxford, Bex takes drugs to cope with her exams and runs away; she is found by Stuart Highway (Ricky Champ). On the night of her leaving party, Bex writes a suicide note to her parents and attempts to overdose on pills. The following morning, Sonia finds her unresponsive in bed. She recovers well but decides to defer Oxford for a year, and once her life is back on track, she makes the decision to go travelling, which Sonia is unhappy about. However, she writes her mother a letter and successfully persuades her that she's doing the right thing. Martin and Sonia see her off at the Tube station.

Retrieved 3 April 2008 Audrey Trueman Audrey Trueman, played by Corinne Skinner-Carter, is the mother of Anthony and Paul Trueman (Nicholas Bailey and Gary Beadle) and is later revealed to be the ex-wife of Patrick Trueman (Rudolph Walker). Audrey was introduced by executive producer John Yorke as the matriarch of a new black family moving to Walford in November 2000. Portrayed as a \\"busy body\\", Audrey was axed in September 2001. Actress Corinne Skinner-Carter revealed in 2008 that she believes Audrey was axed because of creative differences she had with the writers about Audrey's backstory: \\"I received a script and it was all about how Audrey‚Äôs first job in England had been as a lavatory cleaner, how she had worked her way up from that to become a B&B; owner. I didn‚Äôt think it was appropriate and I told them so ‚Äì she may have come from the bottom but not from the bottom of a toilet!\\". Although the toilet cleaner reference was dropped, shortly after Skinner-Carter was informed about \\"a fantastic development in the script ‚Äì Audrey was going to be killed off.\\" Audrey died of a brain haemorrhage in September 2001. Storylines Audrey moves to Walford in 2000, taking over the bed and breakfast, where she lives with her son Anthony Trueman (Nicholas Bailey). A religious woman, she becomes deeply involved with his life, whilst ignoring her other son, tearaway Paul (Gary Beadle). She disapproves of Anthony dating Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace) and tries to interfere many times, leading to Anthony rebelling against his mother. Audrey's main reason for ignoring Paul is, that in the past, Paul and Anthony had been in a car crash that had crippled a young girl. Anthony was drunk at the time and was driving but Paul took the blame and went to prison. Audrey is unaware of this and continues to ignore Paul despite his attempts at making her notice him. In September 2001, Audrey suffers a blow to the head accidentally after being struck by falling debris whilst walking past some building works. Several days later, after an argument with Paul during which he reveals that Anthony was the one who was driving at the time of the accident, Audrey collapses and suffers a severe headache, caused by a delayed reaction to the blow she received earlier. Just before she dies, Audrey tells Paul that she knew about Anthony being the driver and tells Paul to tell Anthony that she loves him and Paul says \\"What about me?\\". Just as Audrey is about to say something to him she dies. However, everything is left to Paul in Audrey's will. Audrey's ex-husband Patrick (Rudolph Walker) arrives in Walford for her funeral. It is subsequently revealed that he and Audrey married in a shotgun wedding, after Audrey became pregnant with Paul. Patrick left shortly after Anthony's birth in the early 1970s. The Truemans later discover that despite Audrey's claims, Paul is not actually Patrick's son; he is the biological child of Milton Hibbert (Jeffery Kissoon), Patrick's friend with whom Audrey had been having an affair. Anthony Trueman Anthony Trueman, played by Nicholas Bailey, is the son of Audrey Trueman (Corinne Skinner- Carter), and the brother of Paul Trueman (Gary Beadle).

In the third session, White took three of the first four frames, compiling a break of 89 in the fourth of these, to lead 11‚Äì8, Higgins then won the next three to level the match at 11‚Äì11 at the end of the session. White won the first frame of the fourth session, and Higgins fluked a brown in the following frame, going on to win it. The scores were also level at 13‚Äì13, with Higgins scoring only nine points across two frames as White moved into a 15‚Äì13 lead, two frames ahead with three to play. Higgins narrowed his deficit to one frame with a break of 72 In the 32nd frame, White was 59 points ahead when he missed a simple red. Higgins then made a break of 69, featuring excellent potting but poor positional play, described in the book Masters of the Baize (2005) as \\"arguably the greatest clearance of all time\\" to take the match to a deciding frame. In the last frame, Higgins made a break of 59 to win the match 16‚Äì15. Charlton moved into a 3‚Äì4 lead against Reardon, but then lost the next four as Reardon made breaks of 50, 47, 48 and 35 and finished the first session 4‚Äì3 ahead. A break of 83 in the first frame of the second session saw Charlton level the match at 4‚Äì4, with Reardon then moving a frame ahead again with a break of 98. Charlton moved into a two frame lead at 7‚Äì5 by winning three consecutive frames, but lost the 13th frame after snookering himself on the yellow. Reardon then equalised the match at 7‚Äì7 with a break of 59 in the last frame of the session. In the third session, the score went to 8‚Äì8 with Reardon then compiling breaks of 94 and 77 to win the next two. Charlton then equalised again with a 54 break in the 17th frame and by winning the 18th on the pink. A 93 clearance by Reardon gave him the lead at 11‚Äì10, but Charlton won the last frame of the session with a break of 64 that started with a fluke. In the fourth session, Reardon won five successive frames to claim a 16‚Äì11 win, making a 98 break in the fourth of those. Final Alex Higgins (pictured in 1968) won his second championship, defeating Ray Reardon in the final 18-15 The final was played on 15 and 16 May between Reardon and Higgins as the best-of-35 frames, held over four sessions. Reardon, six-times champion, had never lost in the world championship final, and it was Higgins' fourth world final, following his win in 1972, and his losing appearances in the 1976 and 1980 finals. The 1982 final was a rematch of the 1976 final, which Reardon won 27‚Äì16. In the opening session, which featured both players making a number of errors, Reardon built a 5‚Äì3 lead. Higgins had compiled a break of 118 in the fourth frame to equalise at 2‚Äì2. In the second session, Reardon was 6‚Äì4 ahead when he missed potting a pink, with Higgins going on to win that frame and the next, to equalise at 6‚Äì6. Reardon won the next frame, but Higgins took the lead at 8‚Äì7, the first day finishing with Higgins 10‚Äì7 up. Reardon won the first frame of the second day with a break of 95, and followed this by winning the next frame. Higgins then won two frames and regained a three frame lead at 12‚Äì9. The lead was reduced as Reardon won frames 22 and 23. The session finished with Higgins leading 13‚Äì12. In the fourth session, Higgins won the first frame, and, after Reardon missed an easy yellow, the second as well. Now 15‚Äì12 ahead, Higgins missed a pot that allowed Reardon in to win the frame to narrow Higgins' advantage to two frames, 15‚Äì13. With Higgins showing signs of nerves, Reardon won a further two frames to level at 15‚Äì15, having required Higgins to concede points from a foul in the second of these. Higgins then won the 31st frame 79‚Äì0, the 32nd 112‚Äì0 with breaks of 38 and 73, and then clinched the match with a clearance of 135. A tearful Higgins summoned his wife and baby daughter from the audience to celebrate with him. The tournament was broadcast on BBC2, with 10.8million viewers on the second day of the final.

This has many benefits, such as: soil sequestration of carbon in response to a growing threat of climate change, a reduced risk of soil erosion, and increased overall soil resilience.  Soil basics = Soil quality  441x441px Soil quality means the ability of the soil to ‚Äúperform its functions.‚Äù Soil is integral to a variety of ecosystem services. These services include food, animal feed, and fiber production, climate moderation, waste disposal, water filtration, elemental cycling, and much more. Soil is composed of organic matter (decomposing plants, animals, and microbes), biomass (living plants, animals, and microbes), water, air, minerals (sand, silt, and clay), and nutrients (nitrogen, carbon, phosphorus). For optimal plant growth, a proper carbon to nitrogen ratio of 20-30:1 must be maintained. Promoting biodiversity is key to maintaining healthy soil. This can be done by growing a variety of plants, always keeping soil covered, maintaining a living root system, and minimizing soil disturbance. Macro and micro organisms assist with processes such as decomposition, nutrient cycling, disease suppression, and moderating CO2 in the atmosphere. Plants have a particularly symbiotic relationship with microbes in the rhizosphere of the soil. The rhizosphere is an ‚Äúarea of concentrated microbial activity close to the root‚Äù and where water and nutrients are readily available. Plants exchange carbohydrates for nutrients excreted by the microbes, different carbohydrates support different microbes. Dead plants and other organic matter also feed the variety of organisms in the soil. Organisms like earthworms and termites are examples of macro organisms in the soil. A good indication that you have quality soil is a lack of pests and diseases. Low biodiversity increases the risk of pests and diseases.  Soil degradation  Soil degradation attributing factors, causes, and effects Having too much or too little of any of the components of soil can cause soil degradation. For example, having a high clay content reduces aeration and water permeability. Another example is that, though phosphorus and nitrogen are essential for plant growth, they are toxic in high amounts. Soil degradation means that soil quality has diminished, which causes ecosystem functions to decline. One third of the globe's land has degraded soil; especially the tropics and subtropics with around 500 million hectares. Soil degradation occurs due to physical, chemical, and biological forces. These forces can be natural and anthropogenic. Tilling is a physical example which causes erosion, compaction, and decreased microbial activity. Erosion is ‚Äúone of the most serious problems facing urban soil quality‚Äù, and the problem is exacerbated by uncovered soil. Compaction occurs when soil is pushed together and becomes harder, so the ability to retain air and water is diminished. This increases erosion and flooding, diminishes the ability of plants to grow good root systems, and reduces biological diversity. Overgrazing is another example in which the root system beneath the soil is damaged, reducing water permeability. Acidification, salinization, nutrient leaching, and toxin contamination are a few types of chemical degradation. Toxins can accumulate in the soil from industrial processes like mining and waste management. Some biological examples include biodiversity loss, emitting greenhouse gasses, reduced carbon content, and a reduced capacity to sequester carbon. One of the most predictable ways to determine whether soil degradation has occurred is to measure its organic carbon content. The soil organic carbon pool is extremely important for soil fertility.  Climate change and the carbon cycle  There is a significant connection between the carbon cycle and climate change. Most greenhouse gases are primarily composed of carbon and they produce an effect where warmer air that is heated by the sun is kept from leaving the atmosphere by forming a barrier in the troposphere. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, greenhouse gasses produced by human activity are the most significant cause of global climate change since the 1950s. Without human interaction, carbon is removed from and reintroduced to soil through a variety of ecosystem processes known as the carbon cycle. Humans have been significantly influencing the global carbon cycle since the Industrial Revolution through various means, such as transportation and agriculture. Through these actions, most of this carbon has moved in one direction, from the lithosphere and biospheres to the atmosphere. By means of fossil fuels and intensive farming, much of the natural carbon in the Earth's pedosphere has been released into the atmosphere, contributing to greenhouse gasses.  Regenerative practices  ‚ÄúSoil works for you if you work for the soil.\\" There are many ways to regenerate soil and improve soil quality, such as land management by conservation agriculture. Agriculture is one of the main factors in the depletion of soil richness in human history. Certain agricultural practices can deplete soil of carbon, such as monocultureSundermeier, A., Reeder, R., & Lal, R. (2005). Soil Carbon Sequestration Fundamentals. Columbus, OH. where only one type of crop is harvested in a field season after season. This depletes nutrients from the soil because each type of plant has a specific set of nutrients that it requires to grow or that it can fix back into the soil. With a lack of plant diversity, only certain nutrients will be absorbed. Over time, these nutrients will be depleted from the soil. Agroecology is an overarching category of approaches to creating a more sustainable agricultural system and increasing the health of soil. These conservation agricultural practices utilize many techniques and resources to maintain healthy soil. Some examples are cover cropping, crop rotation, reducing soil disturbance, retaining mulch, and integrated nutrient management. These practices have many benefits, including increased carbon sequestration and reducing the use of fossil fuels. Permaculture ( from \\"permanent\\" and \\"agriculture\\") is a type of conservation agriculture which is a systems thinking approach that seeks to increase the carbon content of soil by utilizing natural patterns and processes. There is a strong emphasis on knowledge of plants, animals, and natural cycles to promote high efficiency food production, decrease reliance on human involvement, and create a sustainable and resilient ecosystem. This can be accomplished through techniques that involve intentional landscaping to increase the efficiency of capturing rainfall into the system or by placing nitrogen fixing plants near nitrogen demanding plants, such as legumes. Utilization of the interconnections of various plants, animals, and processes is a key practice in permaculture. Native plants should be used whenever possible, their roots help water infiltrate deep into the soil. Agroecology also includes the idea of holistic management. This approach stems from the work of Allan Savory who claims that planned grazing can improve soil health and reverse the effects of desertification by increasing biomass. Desertification occurs when the soil carbon content is severely depleted, greatly reducing soil fertility. This critically inhibits plant growth: without plants soil cannot hold water sufficiently, and becomes dry and brittle over time. Permaculture and holistic management are two different methods that focus on regenerating biomass, nutrient content, and biodiversity to the soil. The more biomass in the soil, the more carbon can be sequestered to sustain the natural ecosystem. There are also many kinds of soil amendments, both organic or inorganic. They promote soil quality in a variety of ways such as: sequestering toxins, balancing the pH of the soil, adding nutrients, and promoting the activity of organisms. The current conditions of the soil will determine which type of amendment and how much to use. Inorganic amendments are generally used for things like improving the texture and structure of the soil, balancing the pH, and limiting the bioavailability of heavy metal toxins. There are two types of inorganic amendments, alkaline and mineral. Some examples of inorganic amendments include wood ash, ground limestone, and red mud. Mineral amendments include gypsum and dredged materials. Organic amendments improve biological activity, water permeability, and soil structure. Mulch, for example, reduces erosion and helps to maintain the temperature of the soil. Compost is rich in organic matter, it is composed of decomposed matter such as food, vegetation, and animal wastes. Adding compost increases the moisture and nutrient content of the soil, and promotes biological activity. Creating compost requires careful management of temperature, the carbon to nitrogen ratio, water, and air. Biochar is an amendment that is full of carbon and is created by pyrolysis, a high temperature decomposition process. Wastes from animals are common soil amendments, usually their manure. The moisture and nutrient content will vary depending on the animal it came from. Human wastes can also be used, like the byproduct biosolids from wastewater facilities. Biosolids can be high in nutrient content, so should be used sparingly.

The first period, I, begins in the mid ninth century and is subdivided into four parts, a, b, c, and d, ending in the early eleventh century.Chittick, 1984, p.11 Period II has two parts, A and B, though the divide between the two is rather vague and could be entirely arbitrary, and dates from the mid eleventh to the late twelfth for the former, and late twelfth to late thirteenth century for the latter.Chittick, 1984, p.11 Period III runs from the late thirteenth century to the fourteenth when Period IV picks up and ends in the early Sixteenth. Period V covers the mid Sixteenth and all of the seventeenth, and the final period covers everything after the Seventeenth century.Chittick, 1984, p.12 Imported wares=Imported Chinese stone and porcelain wares These vessels are interesting because there are no other pieces of contemporary Chinese wares found in east Africa.Chittick, 1984, p.65 There were five types of Chinese wares in period I: :;Dosun ware: ::This is stoneware that typically has an olive green glaze that is usually over grey body. At Manda there are jars with a number of embryonic handles at the shoulder of body.Chittick, 1984, p.66 No complete specimens have been found at Manda but this type of pottery is known from other sites to have been ovoid in shape. This type is found in the pre-mosque strata so they are appearing in Manda as early as 800 AD.Chittick, 1984, p.66 :;Painted ware ::These are thickly potted bowls usually decorated with free hand abstract or floral motifs. They are usually green or green and brown in colour under a yellow or greenish olive glaze.Chittick, 1984, p.66 There is little known about this style from China as not many specimens have been found. This type is also found in pre-mosque strata onward like Dosun. :;Green-grey wares ::This type is also referred to as Yue type and is believed to be ancestral to celadon type pottery.Chittick, 1984, p.66 It typically comes in a matte glaze which is usually grey green on a grey base and is sometimes decorated with marks around the inside and outside of the base.Chittick, 1984, p.66 This style usually takes the form of bowls in Manda. They appear after the reconstruction of the mosque which occurred after 850. :;White porcelain ::These are typically thinly potted bowls decorated with white fabric and a non-translucent white glaze.Chittick, 1984, p.66 This style is also referred to, perhaps misleadingly, as porcelaneous stoneware. The rim of these vessels often has slight decorative nicks. This style probably has a South China origin rather than a North China one and are found in strata dated to between 850 and 950, continuing to be found in strata into Period IIA.Chittick, 1984, p.66 :;White stoneware ::This style is characterized by a cream-coloured paste with a white glaze and is more thickly potted than the porcelain. It typically takes the form of a bowl with a very wide flat base ring.Chittick, 1984, p.67 It is found in earlier strata than the porcelain, dating it to just after the mosque period.Chittick, 1984, p.67 One fragment of a lid has been found at Manda. :;Porcelain and stoneware ::These continue to be found at Manda but are very rare after Period IIB. Islamic wares=Glazed wares of Period I :;Sasanian Islamic ::Sasanian Islamic is the most common style found in this period and finds of this style mainly consist of large vessels which are typically blue-green in colour but can be green-blue.Chittick, 1984, p.70 Many have become a light blue mostly with matting due to age and weathering. There is an inner glaze found in vessels other than the bowls which is usually different from the outer glaze which usually comes in either white, blue, or black, colours which are likely due to firing conditions; if the firing is done incorrectly a purple red shade can be a result.Chittick, 1984, p.70 ::Jars are the largest category of Sasanian wares and are large heavily potted vessels which exhibit both applied and incised decoration usually in a Wavy line motif. The applied decorations, on the other hand, are molded and are restricted to rosettes. These vessels have ring bases and curved handles.Chittick, 1984, p.71 ::Sasanian wares also come as basins with straight flaring sides and a flat base as well as an out-turned rim. They are found in strata from early inhabitance to the beginning of Period IIA.Chittick, 1984, p.76 :;White or Tin Glazed ware ::The specimens at Manda have weathered glazes that were previously dead white but have aged into more of a grey color. This type of pottery has an arguable origin; it is believed that this type of pottery was used to imitate the white Chinese porcelain and/or stoneware.Chittick, 1984, p.77 :;Bowls ::Bowls of Islamic make are similar in shape to Chinese bowls of this period and the base is often recessed. The glaze is usually blue but there are examples of green and one example had blue inscriptions. These vessels are found after Period IA.Chittick, 1984, p.77 :;Lustre ware ::This style is rather rare compared to most other imported wares of the first period and comes in 2 groups. The first is a white opaque glaze with a buff body which is more common and is a variation of the white glazed wares while the second has a dark blue glaze with a white body.Chittick, 1984, p.77 Both types are almost always nearly hemispherical bowls. :;Green and White ware ::This is also very rare in comparison to other types found at Manda. It has a relatively hard, off white or buffed body with a white slip and both the interior and exterior are glazed.Chittick, 1984, p.78 This glaze is usually striped. It is likely that all wares of this type were bowls but due to the fact that the sample size is so small it is impossible to know for certain.Chittick, 1984, p.78 Glazed Islamic wares of Period II :;Sgraffiato ::This style comprises the vast majority of Period II imports.Chittick, 1984, p.78 Specimens are mostly bowls but some jars have been found as well. This style was imported until the end of the thirteenth century. In the 11-12th century there are three types of Sgraffiato, characterized by the type of decoration present on the vessels. Hatched Sgraffiato is mostly floral designs with the background around the designs often composed of incised lines, Simple Sgraffiato is decorated in plain incised curvilinear lines, and finally, Champlev√© Sgraffiato has parts of the slip removed so as to expose the red body of the vessels.Chittick, 1984, p.78 13th century Sgraffiato wares are typically of a far poorer quality and are usually dark green or grey brown in colour with little decoration present.Chittick, 1984, p.79 :;Sub-Nishapur ware ::This type is characterized by a soft reddish brown fabric with a dark brown slip on a yellow background and likely originates in eastern or southern Iran during the tenth or eleventh centuries.Chittick, 1984, p.81 Unglazed Islamic wares These wares comprise 50% of the assemblage in the first period, which is rather unusual as this type of pottery is very rare in other East African sites. All specimens appear to have been wheel thrown.Chittick, 1984, p.81 =Types of unglazed Islamic wares= Unglazed Islamic wares found at Manda are generally identified by vessel type. =Storage jars= The storage jars fall into 5 categories. :;Massive Jars ::Massive jars are highly decorated with incised work, have very short necks with small handles between the neck and the top of the body and can be pink, purple, or red in color.Chittick, 1984, p.84 :;Jars with tall necks ::Jars with tall necks are not as large as the massive jars and are thin-bodied.Chittick, 1984, p.86 They have a fine fabric, which is typically red, sometimes with a black slip.Chittick, 1984, p.86 The jars may have come with strap handles, but it is not known for sure as no vessels have been found with handles. :;Deep Crocks ::Deep crocks with incised decoration have a moderately thickened rim and a hard red fabric.Chittick, 1984, p.88 The deep scored decoration is akin to that found on the massive jars and they perhaps originate from Siraf.Chittick, 1984, p.88 They are fairly common. :;Hole mouth jars ::Hole mouth jars come in a soft green buff fabric and are fairly rare.Chittick, 1984, p.88 =Basins= Basins come in three varieties. :;Straight sides ::Basins with nearly straight sides have a flat base, a plain rim, and are ellipsoid in shape.Chittick, 1984, p.90 They come in a red fabric with a cream slip and the only decorated example consists of wavy incised lines around the rim.Chittick, 1984, p.90 :;Widely flaring bases ::Only a single specimen of this variety has been found at Manda. It has a buff fabric covered by lighter fabric slip and the upper surface of the mouth is decorated with a chevron pattern consisting of 4 deeply incised lines.Chittick, 1984, p.90 :;Ledge rims ::Basins with a wide, flat topped, horizontal ledge rim, with crosshatching are around 30-40 cm in height and are relatively thin body compared to other types of basins.Chittick, 1984, p.90 They can be pink, buff, or grey and are never fired the same color all the way through, along with a white slip with incised decoration.Chittick, 1984, p.90 =Bowls= There are two types of bowls. One is open with straight sides, a plain rim, and a flat base. The only ornamentation on this type is a groove located below the rim and it is covered by a dense, usually cream colored but occasionally brown, fabric.Chittick, 1984, p.90 The other type is a handled bowl with a spout which is between 25 and 35 cm in diameter.Chittick, 1984, p.90 They both have a moulded rim with marked carination, small vertical handles with a ridge down the middle, short spouts and are cream or buff in color; there is a single example in red with a white slip.Chittick, 1984, p.90 =Handled vessels in buff fabric= There is a very large assemblage of this type with a variety of vessels in a number of sizes. Most come with handles and are usually generally covered with a soft porous fabric.Chittick, 1984, p.94 There are large jars that can be up to 50‚Äì60 cm in height, but they also come as jugs and pitchers. The bases of these vessels are usually flat or slightly recessed, but there have been examples found at Manda that exhibit ring bases.Chittick, 1984, p.94 One example is decorated with a molded wavy lines around the base. Another example has a deep red coloring both inside and out.Chittick, 1984, p.94 They are thinly potted and covered in a green buff fabric in the case of the larger vessels and the fabric very closely resembles the paste color found on the Hole mouth jars mentioned previously.Chittick, 1984, p.94 There are examples, however, of the larger vessels in a decidedly pink tinge. The smaller jugs, on the other hand, tend to have a cream colour rather than a buff one, and said buff often has a green tinge to it.Chittick, 1984, p.94 The fabric on these vessels is also very absorbent and rubs off as a fine dust any time it is handled. The decoration on these vessels is usually limited to the upper part of the vessels, and usually consists of incised line designs, but there are also examples of vessels of this type decorated with moulding.Chittick, 1984, p.94 When these moulded designs are present, they are usually on the handles of the vessel, which are in turn sometimes decorated with a very distinctive knob-like design at the upper curve.Chittick, 1984, p.94 These handles can be grouped into two classes; one is rather close in appearance to the Amphora style, and the other is cast in two pieces, always with a figure eight section.Chittick, 1984, p.94 This type of pottery is also called Siraf cream with the more ‚Äúrefined‚Äù varieties being labelled as Gudulia and Eggshell ware. This type of pottery is also remarkably similar to jugs that are found in an early Islamic city called Susa.Chittick, 1984, p.94 Of the specimens of this style found at Manda, the largest percentage were found in early period I deposits, with a few found in deposits that are likely a mix of both periods I and II and several that date to later periods.Chittick, 1984, p.94 This style also has a pilgrim bottle shape that is present in deposits at Kilwa that are not present in Manda deposits.Chittick, 1984, p.94 Painted ware Only three specimens of this type have been found, all of them body sherds which appear to be from jars or bottles. Of the sherds, the largest one shows a coarse crimson fabric with black paint, over a buff slip.Chittick, 1984, p.100 The other two sherds, on the other hand, are coloured with a reddish buff paste with one exhibiting a very thin layer of a green glaze.Chittick, 1984, p.100 These sherds date to Period I and are possibly related to painted wares from Susa.Chittick, 1984, p.100 =Miscellaneous fragments= There are a number of rim sherds from vessels of unknown form but thought to possibly of very deep bowls. The fabric of these vessels is distinctly sandy and usually comes in a pink or red shade.Chittick, 1984, p.100 There is a single sample of a large, very thickly potted vessel, whose fabric is a light green buff. The sides of this vessel are nearly vertical. There is also a single sherd that appears to have been from the late ninth century which is believed to be a pseudo Sigilatta style slipware.Chittick, 1984, p.100 There is also a single sherd of a grey impressed ware vessel which seems to be of a closed wheel thrown variety, perhaps some sort of jug or bottle. The sherd shows a grey-brown paste and is decorated with tooled incised lines and a walked motif.Chittick, 1984, p.100 Pottery of Indian origin Pottery of this origin consists almost entirely of water pots. They are always unglazed but their fabric is distinct from those found on either local or known Islamic pottery.Chittick, 1984, p.101 These vessels are highly unsuited for cooking but there are two specimens in the assemblage that show blackening from fire. These vessels have noticeably out-turned rims, along with very narrow mouths.Chittick, 1984, p.101 The profile of these vessels is rather low and wide as well. The fabric comes in a rather large variety, though the characteristic fabric for this type is a grey shade with a sizable amount of chaff or the like. Some of these vessels are fired buff or red though and there are some with a black grit. These vessels are primarily of Period I but there are examples from Period II and later.Chittick, 1984, p.101 Local pottery The entirety of pottery made in Africa south of the Sahara was unglazed and made without the use of a wheel.Chittick, 1984, p.108 These vessels were either coiled or moulded into shape; there are, however, a small number of specimens that are pinched into shape.Chittick, 1984, p.108 These vessels are always made by open firing rather than firing in a kiln. There is also no acceptable source of clay on the island so while the pottery might be of the local style, where the vessels came from is unknown.Chittick, 1984, p.108 There are some that are likely to have been manufactured on the coast, due to the presence of shell fragments in the paste.Chittick, 1984, p.108 =Fabrics on local pottery= The majority of local pottery has a fabric that is extremely soft and very easily removed. The core is usually a black surface and the colors upon it range from pink and red to grey and a near true black.Chittick, 1984, p.108 There are four types of fabric that can be found in the local pottery at Manda. The first is a very dark, very crumbly fabric.Chittick, 1984, p.108 The second is referred to as Hard Fabric. This fabric rather rare in local pottery, and is characterized by a relatively hard and compacted paste.Chittick, 1984, p.108 Refractory fabric is called so for the large amounts of quartz grains within, and its fabric has a very coarse and gritty feel to it. This type of fabric is only found in crucibles.Chittick, 1984, p.109 The final type is the Pink fabric which is only found in painted wares imported from further south. The surface of these ranges from pink to red, and the paste is rather sandy. These vessels are fired pink to buff throughout.Chittick, 1984, p.109  Early kitchen wares  The first type of Early Kitchen wares is divided into 9 categories and all of them are bag shaped vessels with tall rims that curve outward and an ‚Äús‚Äù shaped neck.Chittick, 1984, p.109 This type is usually decorated with incised decorations, though there is an inverse correlation between the size of the vessel and the skill involved in the decoration; usually the larger the vessel the less skilled the decoration. This type is also characteristic of period IChittick, 1984, p.110 ; Type 1a : This subtype has very fine decoration, likely created with a metal blade of some sort. The decoration is one of a variety of different rectilinear designs. In the entire assemblage of this subtype there are 150 variations, with a very small number having no decoration whatsoever.Chittick, 1984, p.110 ; Type 1b: : The rectilinear decorations on this subtype are usually created when the clay is leather hard with some type of rounded implement.Chittick, 1984, p.110 Occasionally, in addition to the rectilinear designs, there are lunate stab marks bound along the bottom of the design band. These vessels also occasionally have a row of incised crosses around the outer rim.Chittick, 1984, p.111 ; Type 1c: : The vessels of this subtype are thicker relative to the others and the decorations are very rough. The incisions are done before the clay has become leather hard and the designs usually take a diagonal and triangular pattern.Chittick, 1984, p.111 ; Type 1d: : This subtype is highly similar to 1c with the sole exception that the incised designs are much lighter.Chittick, 1984, p.112 ; Type 1e: : These vessels have very narrow necks and harder fabrics than the previous subtypes and are also found Period II.Chittick, 1984, p.112 ; Type 1f: : These actually have puncture decoration rather than incised decoration around the neck, which have very slight stepping; the puncture decoration is sometimes combined with notches on the rim of the vessels.Chittick, 1984, p.112 ; Type 1g: : These vessels have a pronounced ‚Äús‚Äù profile, and rectilinear decoration.Chittick, 1984, p.113  Significance  The reason that pottery at Manda is so significant is the fact that none of the pottery found at Manda originated there. This fact, in addition to the fact that Manda is an island, gives an inkling as to exactly how important trade was to the early town. The vast geographic range of the pottery found at Manda also gives archaeologists an idea of just how far-flung the trading ties Manda and the rest of the Swahili coast were.Chittick, 1984, p.230 NotesReferences * African pottery History of Kenya Lamu Archipelago ","title":"Pottery of Manda Island"},{"id":"48579740","text":"Whitney Michele Bond (born December 6, 1984) is an American television food personality, food blogger, social media consultant, and cookbook author.

She is the first woman to hold the office in the country. She was elected in a parliamentary vote, receiving 327 votes out of 549 against Kul Bahadur Gurung, the presidential candidate of the Nepali Congress. She previously served as the vice-chairperson of the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist‚ÄìLeninist) and was the chair of the All Nepal Women's Association before being elected President. In 2016, Forbes placed her on number 52 in their list of the world's 100 most powerful women. She previously served as the Minister of Defence, the first woman to hold the office, in the Madhav Kumar Nepal government. She also served as the Minister of Environment and Population in 1997, and has been an active campaigner for environmental awareness and women rights concerns in Nepal. In June 2017, she visited the headquarters of the IUCN in Gland, Switzerland and met with the director general Inger Andersen to discuss opportunities for enhanced collaboration on nature conservation and sustainable development. Early life Bidhya Devi Bhandari was born on 19 June 1961, in Mane Bhanjyang of Bhojpur, to Ram Bahadur Pandey and Mithila Pandey. Her political career began from a leftist student union and she joined the Communist Party of Nepal (Marxist‚ÄìLeninist) in 1980. Political career Bhandari was active in politics from an early age. According to the details provided by the CPN-UML, Bhandari joined politics as an activist of the Youth League of CPN(ML) in 1978, from Bhojpur. She played a role as an in-charge for Eastern Zone Committee of ANNFSU from 1979 to 1987. Her active political journey, however, started when she received party membership from the CPN (ML) in 1980. After completing her school level study, Bhandari was enrolled in Mahendra Morang Adarsha Multiple Campus where she was elected treasurer of the students' union. Also, she played a pivotal role as a chairperson of the women's wing of GEFONT from 1993 before being elected a central committee member of the CPN‚ÄìUML in 1997. Bhandari was elected twice in parliamentary elections in 1994 and 1999, defeating former Prime Minister Krishna Prasad Bhattarai and Damanath Dhungana, respectively. However, she lost in the 2008 Constituent Assembly poll, and was then nominated under the proportional electoral system. She served as the Minister of Defense in the cabinet of Prime Minister Madhav Kumar Nepal. She was re- elected under the proportional electoral system in the second Constituent Assembly elections in 2013. Her influence in the party remained dominant when she was elected as vice-chairperson of the CPN‚ÄìUML in its eighth general convention held in Butwal. Bhandari, who was re-elected vice-chairperson in the party's next general convention, is considered a close confidante to party chairman and Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli. Controversies Bhandari has been accused of taking a partisan stance since being elected President. She held onto the National Assembly election ordinance delaying the formation of the government after the 2017 legislative elections. She also held the nomination of three members to National Assembly sent by the outgoing Deuba government but immediately approved the nominations sent in by the incoming Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli. Personal life Bhandari was married to Madan Bhandari, a popular Nepalese communist leader, who died in a car accident near Dasdhunga in Nepal's Chitwan District in 1993. The couple have two daughters, Usha Kiran Bhandari and Nisha Kusum Bhandari. The accident is alleged to have been a murder, but currently remains unsolved. She is related to Nepali Congress leader Gyanendra Bahadur Karki.

It is the first story in the series set in the fictional village of Milkvillehttps://www.kirkusreviews.com/book- reviews/eduard-uspensky/uncle-fedya-his-dog-and-his-cat/ (; lit.\\"soured milk\\") created by Uspensky. The series features a city boy named Fyodor, or Fedya for short, and his friends, the talking animals. The stories focus on their adventures in Prostokvashino and their relationships with its residents, including the irritable postman Pechkin. In 1993 it was translated from Russian by Michael Henry Heim with illustrations by Vladimir Shpitalnik.http://www.shpitalnik.com/resume.html  Plot  Fyodor lives in the apartment with his parents, who call him \\"Uncle\\" because of his seriousness, independence and intelligence. He learns to read at 4, and starts cooking for himself at 6. Unlike his mother, he is very fond of animals. One day he meets a stray talking cat, who used to spend his nights in the attic but has nowhere to live now due to the house repair works. Fyodor takes the cat home, but his mother does not let him keep it, so the boy decides to run away and take his cat with him. The next day they leave a note to Fyodor's parents and take a bus to a rural area. Fyodor names the cat Matroskin. They arrive in a village called Prostokvashino (lit. Soured milk village), and settle in an empty house. A talking dog named Sharik promises to guard their new house, so they all start living together. The next day they go swimming and on their way back meet with curious Pechkin the Postmaster. He insists that they subscribe to something. Fyodor chooses Murzilka, Sharik opts for \\"something about hunting\\" and Matroskin politely refuses, saying that he would rather save money. Fyodor's parents miss their son and begin looking for him. They publish a missing person article in the newspaper. Meanwhile, Matroskin decides to buy a cow. Unfortunately, they do not have any money. Fyodor suggests that they look for a buried treasure in the forest. They walk to the forest, find a hill with a cave, and Fyodor starts digging nearby. He indeed finds a chest with money and jewels. They all decide to buy presents for themselves. Sharik wants a gun for hunting and a dog collar with medallions; Matroskin needs a cow (he decides to \\"borrow\\" one at the local service bureau and try it out before making a purchase); Fyodor wants to buy a bike, but his friends convince him to get a tractor instead, because it is much more practical. He sends a letter to a tractor factory and encloses 100 rubles, requesting a small tractor which \\"needs little gas and runs fast\\". In return, Fyodor receives an experimental 20-hp tractor model \\"Mitya\\", which uses food for fuel rather than gasoline. Unfortunately the tractor stops next to every house whenever it smells food, so Matroskin has to force it to move on a straight line by holding a sausage on a fishing-rod in front of it. People from Prostokvashino begin to like Uncle Fyodor, because he is hard-working and friendly with animals. The villagers bring him stray and sick animals, including a small gloomy jackdaw Jack Grabbit, that they adopt. After Fedya discovers from Pechkin the Postmaster that his parents are concerned about him, he decides to send them a letter. He starts by writing that his life in Prostokvashino is great, but then abandons his task to play with some children, leaving Matroskin and Sharik to continue the letter. They add pieces of their own information, such as \\"my paws ache sometimes\\", but \\"I have so much warm milk\\" that \\"I don't even want to look at mice. I simply catch them for amusement\\", and \\"I started moulting the other day\\". After receiving this letter, Fyodor's parents begin panicking. They find a mention of Prostokvashino on the postmark and send letters to every Prostokvashino village that they could find on a map. They get a reply from Pechkin. Meanwhile, Sharik purchases a gun and goes to the forest to hunt. He almost drowns in the process, but is saved by an annoyed beaver. Sharik is very ashamed at being saved by the very animals that he planned to hunt, so he decided to do fishing instead. However Sharik gets depressed, because he could not satisfy his hunting instinct by shooting from the gun. Fedya eventually presents him with a camera gun for wildlife photography. Matroskin's cow, Murka (popular female cat's name. lit. purring cat) gives birth to a black calf Gavryusha. Summer is over, everyone goes about their own business. Sharik spends all his time in the forest enjoying photography, Matroskin trains Gavryusha in obedience, teaches him to play fetch with sticks and guard the house like a watch dog. Uncle Fyodor catches a serious cold, and Matroskin and Sharik could not help him in any way. Suddenly Fedya's parents arrive and his mother takes care of the boy with Matroskin's assistance, while his father and Sharik take the tractor \\"Mitya\\" and drive to the city to buy antibiotics. Unfortunately, Fyodor is still very ill and must return to the city. Fyodor's mother is impressed with Matroskin's skills and intelligence and invites him and Sharik back to their apartment, but the pair is unwilling to part with Murka and Gavryusha. Matroskin suggests that Fyodor should come visit them on school holidays and at weekends.  Books Adaptations= Studio Ekran's film series  The film title screen. Uncle Fedya, His Dog, and His Cat was adapted into the animated film trilogy with the same name by Studio Ekran. Studio Ekran released three short films, Matroskin and Sharik () in 1975, Mitya and Murka () in 1976, and Mom and Dad () in 1976. The series was directed by Yury Klepatsky and Lidia Surikova with the music composed by Anatoly Bykanov. The films were narrated by A. Mikhailov with characters voiced by Victor Baikov, Svetlana Kharlap, A. Gorunova, A. Verbitsky, Z. Andreyeva, Y. Khromova. Among the animators were Olga Anashkina, Boris Savin, A. Abadkina, N. Bazeltseva, Vladimir Kadukhin. These films are largely forgotten nowadays, put in the shade by the much more popular series created at the Soyuzmultfilm studio.  Soyuzmultfilm's film series  Soyuzmultfilm made three films set in Prostokvashino, all directed by Vladimir Popov. However, only the first one, The Three from Prostokvashino (1978), is based on the book. The other two films, School Holidays in Prostokvashino (1980) and Winter in Prostokvashino (1984) have original screenplays written by Eduard Uspensky. He later incorporated some of those plots into his Prostokvashino novellas. All three films received critical praise and were very popular in the Soviet Union. They were praised for their \\"realism\\", \\"recognizable characters and situations\\" and for the fact that they appealed to adults as well as children. Oleg Tabakov's performance as Matroskin the Cat became especially famous. Characters= Fedya  Uncle Fyodor (), or Fedya for short (\\"Fedya\\" is a hypocorism of the Russian given name Fyodor) is the main character of the series. At the beginning of the first book he lives in the city with his parents Dima and Rimma. He likes animals, and often brings stray animals home to the disapproval of his mother who won't let him keep any pets. After meeting and yet another argument with his parents, he decides to leave home. At the end of Uncle Fedya, His Dog, and His Cat Fyodor's mother takes a liking to Matroskin the Cat. Uncle Fyodor is voiced by Maria Vinogradova in Soyuzmultfilm's series. His hair is blond in Ekran's films and red in Soyuzmultfilm's film series.  Matroskin the Cat  The voice actor Oleg Tabakov holding the painting of Matroskin the Cat, presented to him (2007). Matroskin the Cat (, –º–∞—Ç—Ä–æ—Å lit. seaman) is an anthropomorphic cat. He has a very economical, sensible, and rational personality, and he looks for financial benefits in everything. He used to live in the capital with the professor who studied the animal language. From professor Syomin, Matroskin learned to understand and speak the human language. He also learned to read, write and count. Matroskin becomes the housekeeper and the farmer in Uncle Fyodor's house. He has many interests and skills, including accounting, embroidery, cooking, baking, sewing, singing, playing the guitar, and reading. He takes care of their home economics. He calls \\"Matroskin\\" his \\"surname\\". He likes to tease Sharik, but generally treats him well, although he is often upset by Sharik's \\"uselessness\\". Matroskin the Cat is voiced by Svetlana Kharlap in Ekran's films and by Oleg Tabakov in Soyuzmultfilm's series.  Sharik  Sharik ( lit. small balloon) is an anthropomorphic dog. He is a good-natured stray dog, who had lived in the village before meeting Uncle Fyodor. He learned to speak from the same professor who taught the cat. While guarding professor Syomin's country house, Sharik learned to speak because the professor was writing a Sighthound Dictionary. To Matroskin the Cat's utter disappointed, Sharik does not have many useful skills: he admits that he can only wash the dishes by \\"licking\\" them. However he follows the letter of the law, i.e. he has a passport, as opposed to Matroskin who claims that his paws and tail are his identity documents. He is voiced by Lev Durov in Soyuzmultfilm's series.  Pechkin the Postmaster  Pechkin (, –ø–µ—á–∫–∞ lit. oven), or Igor Ivanovich Pechkin, is described as a middle-aged man in a hat. He is the postman in Prostokvashino. He is extremely nosy and thinks that he has the right \\"to know everything\\" that is happening in the village. Pechkin is a comical character, who is always being outsmarted by the animals.https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/bitstream/handle/2142/12862/bulletincenterchv00047i00002_opt.pdf?sequence=2 He is voiced by Boris Novikov in Soyuzmultfilm's series.  Jack Grabbit  Jack Grabbit ( from the Russian verb —Ö–≤–∞—Ç–∞—Ç—å meaning \\"to snatch\\" or \\"to grab\\") is a small thieving jackdaw. He snatches everything that catches his eye, hides it in the cupboard, and then fiercely protects his \\"treasures\\", which is very inconvenient for Fyodor and his friends. Matroskin tries to teach him the human language, but Jack Grabbit only manages to learn one phrase: \\"Who's there?\\" Still Matroskin counts that as a success, because he thinks that a well-timed question asked behind the door could scare away the burglars. This idea backfires when Pechkin comes to the house while there's nobody in. After announcing: \\"This is Pechkin the Postmaster, I've brought your Murzilka magazine\\" he is being continuously asked \\"Who's there?\\" by Jack Grabbit. This conversation continues for a long time, leading to Pechkin's nervous breakdown, and afterwards Uncle Fyodor has to treat him with tea and candies. Jack Grabbit is voiced by Zinaida Naryshkina in Soyuzmultfilm's series.  Murka  Murka (, a female cat name lit. purry) is a red cow. After Matroskin starts to miss milk and decides to purchase a cow, he comes back from the service bureau with a cow that he names Murka. To Sharik's amazement, she eats all curtains and flowers in the pots in their house. Fyodor eventually puts her on chain. Murka is a silly and spoilt animal, however she gives a lot of milk. In fact, Matroskin gets so much milk, that he fills every bucket, jar and even the fish tank with it. After soured milk starts liking from the tap, he decides to buy a calf, but it turns out to be unnecessary because Murka gives birth to a black calf. They name him Gavryusha ( hypocorism for Gavriil). At the end of Uncle Fedya, His Dog, and His Cat Murka reveals that she can use human language too. When Matroskin asks why she didn't talk before, she answers: \\"To you? What for?\\"  References External links * Uncle Fedya, His Dog, and His Cat at the FantLab. 1973 in Russia 1973 short stories 1973 children's books Russian children's books Russian short stories Short stories set in Russia Russian novellas 20th-century Russian novels Children's novellas ","title":"Uncle Fedya, His Dog, and His Cat"},{"id":"48579954","text":"KVRE (92.9 FM) is a radio station licensed to Hot Springs Village, Arkansas.

She was the first woman to train a Classic flat races winner. Her horse Gilles de Retz won the 2,000 Guineas in 1956, but her name did not appear in the record books as the Jockey Club did not recognise women trainers at that time and the horse ran under the name of her assistant, Charles Jerdein, instead. She was one of the first three women to be elected as a member of the Jockey Club in December 1977, alongside Priscilla Hastings and Ruth Wood (n√©e Primrose), Countess of Halifax. Early life She was born in Wrexham, the twin sister of Fulke Walwyn, later also a horse trainer. Her father, Colonel Fulke Walwyn, was an officer in the Royal Welch Fusiliers, and Master of the Monmouth Hounds from 1922 to 1931. Her mother died when Helen and Fulke were still young. She was educated at home. After her father married one of their governesses, she lived with an aunt in Cheshire. Their cousin Peter Walwyn was also a racehorse trainer. She married Gordon Johnson Houghton in 1937. Training career Alongside her husband, she trained horses in Cheshire. Her husband served with the Cheshire Yeomanry in the Second World War. The couple bought the Woodway stable near Blewbury from trainer Francis Cobb in 1945, and moved to Berkshire (now Oxfordshire). She took over the running of the Woodway stable after her husband was killed in a hunting accident in 1952. The Jockey Club refused to issue training licences to women until Florence Nagle won a court case in 1966, and so the licence was held by a series of male assistants. While she continued to train the horses, the licence was officially held by Colonel Dick Poole, then Charles Jerdein, then her cousin Peter Walwyn, before her son Fulke Johnson Houghton took over in 1961. Her achievements were belatedly recognised by the Jockey Club in December 1977, when she was one of the first three women to be elected as a member, alongside Priscilla Hastings and Ruth Wood (n√©e Primrose), Countess of Halifax.

He served between 1284 and his death, but was dismissed and reinstated four times during this period. As the chieftain of the Al Fadl, a clan of the Tayy tribe, which dominated the Syrian Desert, Muhanna wielded considerable influence among the Bedouin. He was described by historian Amalia Levanoni as \\"the eldest and most senior amir\\" of the Al Fadl during his era.Levanoni 1995, p. 177. Muhanna was first appointed amir al- øarab to replace his father Isa ibn Muhanna in 1284. He was imprisoned by Sultan al- Ashraf Khalil in 1293, but released two years later. In 1300, he commanded a wing of the Mamluk army in the Third Battle of Homs against the Mongol Ilkhanate. He defected to the latter in the early years of Sultan an-Nasir Muhammad's reign (1310‚Äì1341), ushering in a policy of playing off the Mamluks and the Mongols to further his own interests. An-Nasir eventually banished Muhanna and his tribe to the depths of the Syrian Desert. Through mediation by the Ayyubid prince, al-Afdal Muhammad, Muhanna reconciled with an-Nasir in 1330 and remained loyal to the Mamluks until his death five years later. Muhanna was succeeded by his son Musa, and his descendants filled the office of amir al- øarab for the next seven decades with minor interruption. Throughout his reign, Muhanna was granted numerous iqta øat (fiefs) by an- Nasir, including Palmyra, Salamiyah, Sarmin and Douma. Muhanna later criticized an-Nasir's generous iqta ø distribution to the Bedouin tribes, believing it would ultimately degrade the character of the Bedouin and in turn, weaken the Muslim armies. Ancestry Muhanna, also known as Muhanna II, belonged to the Al Fadl clan, a branch of the large Arab tribe of Tayy. His grandfather Muhanna ibn Mani' ibn Haditha ibn Ghudayya ibn Fadl ibn Rabi'a al-Ta'i or \\"Muhanna I\\" was the head of the clan and sometimes referred to as the \\"king of the Arabs\\" by the Mamluk government; his son Isa became the first lord of Palmyra as a reward for supporting the Mamluk sultan Qalawun in the Second Battle of Homs in 1281. Lord of Palmyra=First and second reigns castle of Palmyra; the city's center of power Muhanna succeeded his father 'Isa as lord of Palmyra and amir al- øarab in 1284, after receiving the appointment from Sultan Qalawun. Muhanna visited Qalawun's successor, Sultan al-Ashraf Khalil, in Cairo in 1291.Tritton 1948, p. 568. In 1293, after celebrating the wedding of his granddaughter, Muhanna and his sons and brothers met al-Ashraf Khalil at the wells of Furqlus, near Homs, where the sultan had been on a hunting expedition.Abu al-Fida, ed. Holt 1983, p. 20. Al- Ashraf Khalil had Muhanna and his family arrested and imprisoned in the Cairo Citadel.Hiyari 1975, p. 518. Muhanna was replaced by his distant cousin, Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr, from the Al Ali branch of Al Fadl. Muhanna was released with his family and restored as amir al- øarab and lord of Palmyra two years later by Sultan al-Adil Kitbugha. In 1298, Muhanna performed the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca. Muhanna later commanded the right wing of the Mamluk army during the Third Battle of Homs in 1299/1300, during which the Mamluks were defeated by the Mongol Ilkhanids. In 1311, the Mamluk na'ib (governor) of Aleppo, Qarasunqur, defected to the Ilkhanids and was given refuge by Muhanna, who unsuccessfully attempted to mediate between Qarasunqur and Sultan an-Nasir Muhammad (r. 1310‚Äì1341). These circumstances together with Muhanna's suspicions of an-Nasir's negative disposition toward him prompted Muhanna and Qarasunqur to seek safe haven in Ilkhanid-held Iraq.Hiyari 1975, p. 519. To that end, in 1312, Muhanna sent his son Musa to confer with √ñljait√º of the Ilkhanate, and afterward he defected to the latter with his son Sulayman;Tritton 1948, p. 568. unlike his father, Musa remained loyal to the Mamluks.Tritton 1948, pp. 568‚Äì569. √ñljait√º gave Muhanna iqta øat (fiefs) in al- Hillah, south of Baghdad. An-Nasir Muhammad consequently dismissed Muhanna from his principality and appointed his brother Fadl ibn Isa the lord of Palmyra. Third reign Muhanna arrived at the Ilkhan's court in 1316, but then decided to go back to Palmyra where he was contacted by the sultan who summoned him to his court in Cairo. Muhanna avoided meeting the sultan, and sent his brothers and sons instead. He was able to gain the sultan's forgiveness and was restored to his position in 1317. The defection and subsequent reconciliation with an-Nasir marked the first episode in Muhanna's policy of extracting maximum gain from both the Mamluks and the Ilkhanids. According to contemporary historian Abu'l Fida, who maintained good ties with the Al Fadl, Muhanna pursued a policy whereby both the Mamluks and Ilkhanids accorded him iqta øat, money and robes of honor while he stayed effectively neutral, \\"not going to this party or that; a case the like of which had never happened before\\". Moreover, Fadl too participated in this policy with Muhanna, albeit discreetly; the contemporary historian al-Umari wrote \\"Muhanna and Fadl were agreed at heart, but openly they were otherwise\\". An-Nasir sought to keep the Al Fadl loyal to him and prevent their defection to the Ilkhanate, as well as ensure they would not disrupt peaceful travel on the roads. To accomplish this, an-Nasir adopted an unprecedented policy among Mamluk sultans by distributing large iqta øat and grants to the Bedouin, namely the Al Fadl. Moreover, an-Nasir granted Al Fadl members' requests for possession of particularly lucrative iqta øat belonging to the Mamluk emirs (commanders/princes) of Aleppo, Hama and Damascus (the Mamluk emirs were typically compensated with other iqta øat).Levanoni 1995, pp. 176‚Äì177. In addition to Palmyra, Sarmin and Salamiyah, Muhanna was also given the town of Douma in the Ghouta near Damascus as an iqta. Muhanna criticized an-Nasir for the lavish distribution of iqta øat to his tribesmen out of belief that such excesses would ruin the character of the Bedouin and ultimately weaken the Muslim armies. He also asserted to an-Nasir that \\"even if he [sic] wished to change this situation ... you will no longer be able to do so\\" since the tribesmen would not willingly forfeit their new properties. Muhanna later reestablished contact with the Ilkhanate, causing the sultan to banish him with his whole tribe in 1320. On an-Nasir's order, the Mamluk army in Syria drove the Al Fadl from their home district of Salamiyah and pursued them eastward up to the Euphrates fortress towns of al-Rahba and Anah. According to Ibn Abi al-Fada'il, Muhanna was punished because he went back on an agreement his son Sulayman made with an-Nasir in 1319. The agreement stipulated that the Al Fadl would receive 250,000 silver dirhams and the iqta øat of Adhri'at and Bosra in return for joining the Mamluk army as auxiliaries in an upcoming campaign against Ilkhanid-held Sinjar; an-Nasir gave them the iqta øat and money, but when the Mamluk army arrived, Muhanna's forces stopped it at 'Urd near Palmyra and refused it passage through Al Fadl territory. The tribe was exiled from their encampments in the Palmyrene steppe and were forced to live deep in the Syrian Desert. Final reign and death Ten years later, Muhanna contacted the Ayyubid emir al-Afdal Muhammad of Hama (vassal of the Mamluks), and requested that he intercede with the sultan on Muhanna's behalf; an-Nasir ultimately forgave Muhanna, reinstating him in 1330. This marked the end of Muhanna's policy of playing the Mamluks and Ilkhanids against each other. Thereafter, Muhanna remained loyal to the sultanate until his death near Salamiyah in June 1335, at around age 80. According to historian A. S. Tritton, \\"there was public lamentation\\" for Muhanna's death and \\"black was worn\\" in mourning.Tritton 1948, p. 569. Legacy Genealogy of the Banu Tayy tribe of Syria. The Al Fadl branch is depicted by the blue line Historian Amalia Levanoni described Muhanna as \\"the eldest and most senior amir\\" of the Al Fadl during his era.Levanoni 1995, p. 177. By 1352, Muhanna's descendants amounted to 110 men, all with their own clans, iqta ø and princely titles.Levanoni 1995, p. 178. According to Levanoni, Muhanna's warning to an- Nasir about the effects of distributing and subsequently seizing iqta øat \\"came true only a short time\\" after Muhanna's death, when his son and successor, Musa, threatened to start a Bedouin revolt and defect to the Ilkhanate if an- Nasir did not return iqta øat confiscated from the Al Fadl.

Although he signed his paintings \\"A. Mollinger\\", some sources refer to him as Gerrit Mollinger.  Biography  His father was an infantry officer. He began his studies at the municipal art school and was apprenticed to Willem Benedictus Stoof (1816-1900), a local genre artist. Later, he worked with his brother Louis (1825-1860), who had already established himself as a portrait painter. For two years, beginning in 1856, he took lessons from Willem Roelofs in Brussels. In 1860, he became a member of Arti et Amicitiae. He eventually decided to focus on landscapes with figures, in the style of the Barbizon school. His works were very successful in the British Isles; winning awards at the 1862 International Exhibition in London and the Edinburgh Exposition of 1866. Shortly after the latter event, the Scottish painter Sir George Reid visited Utrecht to take lessons from him and introduced Dutch painting styles to Scotland. This, however, was met with disapproval from the Royal Scottish Academy. By this time, Mollinger was beginning to display the advanced symptoms of tuberculosis, which had been diagnosed the year before. From 1866 to 1867, he lived in Menton, on the French Riviera, seeking a cure, but the disease continued to worsen and he returned to Utrecht, where he died at his home. Friends and relatives took up a collection to erect a monument on his grave.

It contains the oldest known cave paintings in Central Europe. The cave has been known to locals long before World War I, after which it was partially destroyed due to limestone quarrying that included the use of explosives. On 28 July 1978, a team of speleologists (A. Done, F. Cucu, T. Vadeanu, M. Codrescu, Simona Manolescu) from the Emil Racovi»õƒÉ Speleologic Club () explored the cave, noticing the existence of cave rock paintings in one of the caverns. The following spring archeologist Marin C√¢rciumaru accompanied by two team members launched the scientific research. Inside a moderately sized cavern of approximately , besides a well preserved image of a horse, an image of a feline, the representation of a bird, of another horse and an image that vaguely resembled a human figure were discovered. A chemical analysis established that the paintings were executed with red clay rich in iron oxides (13% Fe2O3). Marin C√¢rciumaru, according to analogies in Europe, estimated that the Cuciulat cave paintings were completed during the Upper Paleolithic, about 12,000 years ago. This dating could not be supported by other evidence of archaeological nature. A significant part of the cave had been already destroyed by quarrying, including possible traces of a human habitation in the cave or in its immediate vicinity. It compromised the chances to discover artifacts that would provide additional clues for the dating of the paintings. The individual images are silhouettes with neither outlines nor any shading. The painted horse is long and high, the bird is long and high. The image that resembles a human, in a very poor state of conservation, is high and wide. In 1985 the entrance of the cave became inaccessible due to a landslide inside the former quarry area. In this context, the present condition of the cave paintings is not known. The interest for the Cuciulat cave and its cave paintings has been recently revived. A new research and excavation campaign is under discussion on the basis of contemporary techniques and dating methods, that might also allow eventual identification of drawings that were possibly omitted during the 1979 campaign.

In August 1968, the Detroit Board of Education and the superintendent of Detroit's Catholic schools, and the sponsoring Old Newsboys Association announced that the Goodfellow Game would be discontinued. Sagging attendance and interest, as well as difficulties in controlling enthusiastic fans at Tiger Stadium, were cited as the reason. In its 30-year history, the Goodfellow Game raised $1.4 million for Christmas gifts for needy children. Four days after the announcement, the Detroit Red Wings announced that they would donate the proceeds from their September 28 game against the Montreal Canadiens to the Old Newsboys Association to make up for the revenue lost from the traditional high school football game.

Details of male moth genitalia, Plate 15 from a monograph by Annette Frances Braun on the moth family Tischeriidae. Annette Frances Braun (1884‚Äì1978) was an American entomologist and leading authority on microlepidoptera, kinds of moths. Her special interest was moths whose larvae live as leaf miners. Early life and education Annette Frances Braun was born on August 24, 1884, to George F. and Emma Maria (Wright) Braun in Cincinnati, Ohio. She got her education at the University of Cincinnati, receiving her A.B. in 1906, her A.M. in 1908, and her Ph.D. in 1911, making her the first woman to earn a Ph.D. from the University of Cincinnati; her younger sister Emma Lucy Braun would be the second. Career Braun began her career as a zoology teaching assistant at the University of Cincinnati (1911‚Äì19) before turning to private research. She developed expertise in the moths of the eastern North American forests, becoming an international authority who has been described as one of the most accomplished lepidopterists of the 20th century. She described and named over 340 species in her lifetime and published four major monographs and dozens of papers on moths. A skilled artist with pen and ink, she often illustrated her work with detailed anatomical drawings made from her own field observations and microscope studies. Braun lived in Mount Washington, a suburb of Cincinnati, Ohio, with her sister Emma, who was a noted botanist. Part of their garden was used as an outdoor entomological and botanical laboratory, and the sisters often took field trips together as well. Starting in the 1910s, they walked (and later drove) hundreds of miles through the forests of eastern North America‚Äîespecially Ohio, Kentucky, and Tennessee‚Äîin search of plant and moth specimens. They were also dedicated conservationists, and Braun is remembered for her efforts to preserve natural areas in Adams County, Ohio. Braun served as vice-president of the Entomological Society of America (1926). She was also a trustee of the Cincinnati Museum of Natural History. Braun continued working and publishing into her eighties. She died on November 27, 1978, at the age of 94. Legacy Species named after Braun include Argyresthia annettella and Glyphipterix brauni. \\"Annette's Rock\\" is a trailside landmark named after Braun on the Lynx Prairie nature reserve in Ohio. The Annette and E. Lucy Braun Papers are held by the Cincinnati History Library & Archives, which is part of the Cincinnati Museum Center. In addition, the Smithsonian Institution holds an archive that includes some 5000 of Braun's slides, while the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia houses her collection of 30,000 moth specimens.

The book confronts the perception of a STEM professional shortage, exposes the flawed economics supporting the perception, and cites findings that offshore outsourcing firms are the predominant users of high-skill temporary employment-visas. The book's publication follows media reporting that Pfizer, Southern California Edison, and Walt Disney World to name a few, have each forced hundreds of employees to train their foreign replacements or risk their severance, unemployment eligibility and professional references. Additional studies cited conclude that a high percentage of qualified U.S. STEM professionals are unable to find employment in their field. Overview Rather than an expos√© on the illegal immigration topic, Sold Out highlights temporary-employment immigration, watered-down regulations, the lack of will and authority of regulators to vet applicants and investigate abuses. Malkin is the daughter of immigrants from the Philippines, and Sold Out is a continuation of her writings on the immigration topic. Invasion (2002) was her first published book, a New York Times Best Seller reaching #14. Collectively, Malkin refers to K street lobbyists, their multinational benefactors and the politicians who cave to their demands as crapweasels in Sold Out.

Biography Lyudmila Vsevolodovna Keldysh was born on 12 March 1904 in Orenburg, Russia to Mariya Aleksandrovna (n√©e Skvortsova) and Vsevolod Mikhailovich Keldysh. Her family was descended of Russian nobility and though they were well-to-do before the Russian Revolution, they would later face difficulty because of their heritage. Because her father was a construction expert for the military, they moved frequently and she lived in Helsinki between 1905 and 1907, then in St. Petersburg until 1909, and then moved to Riga, Latvia. Vsevolod took a position there at the Riga Polytechnic Institute, until the German invasion of 1915 forced the family to flee to Moscow, where they lived in the Losinoostrovsky District. Keldysh attended school, finishing her education in Ivanovo-Voznesensk, where the family had moved in 1918. She continued her education at the Moscow State University, graduating in 1925. While she was studying, she joined the research group of Nikolai Nikolaevich Luzin in 1923, as did Petr Sergeevich Novikov, who she would later marry. Luzin published her first mathematical theory, which was an evaluation using continued fractions of the fourth Borel set in 1930. Keldysh began teaching in 1930 at the Moscow Aviation Institute. Around this time, she had her first son, Leonid Keldysh, in 1931. In 1934, she left the Aviation Institute and began teaching at the Institute of the USSR Academy of Sciences specializing in set theories. That same year, she married Novikov and published three papers: On the Homeomorphism of Canonical Elements of the 3rd Class; On Simple Functions of Class a; and On the Structure of B Measurable Functions of Class a. The following year, Stalin began his purges and Keldysh lost both and uncle and a nephew, and her parents were both arrested, though later released. In the next few years, she had two more sons Andrei Petrovich Novikov and Sergei Petrovich Novikov, who would both become noted mathematicians. She had continued her research on Borel sets and in 1941 defended her thesis, but before she received her degree the family fled the advancing German troops. Most of the faculty of the Institute of the Academy of Sciences were considered evacuees when they arrived in Kazan, but Keldysh and her three sons were treated as refugees. They found lodging in the gym of the Kazan University with several hundred other refugees, until Novikov arrived and the family was given a dorm room. Novikov was ill and required surgery, leaving Keldysh shuttling between her husband's hospital room and her children's dorm room. In late 1942, they were able to return to Moscow. Keldysh had two daughters, Nina and then Elena, during this time. She published a paper, On the structure of measurable sets B in 1944, and followed it in 1945 with Open mappings of A-sets, which marked a turning point in her work. She was also finally able, in 1945, to have her thesis published and from this point on, her work focused more on geometric topology. She continued publishing from the mid-1940s into the 1960s. Keldysh's research was honored repeatedly in this period and she received the Order of the Red Banner of Labor, the Order of Maternal Glory in the 2nd degree and in 1958 received the Prize of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. In 1964, Keldysh was made a full professor at Moscow State University and in 1966 she published the book Topological embeddings into Euclidean space to help her students understand her lectures. She lectured until 1974, when she resigned in protest of the expulsion of one of her students. At the time, Novikov was ill and he died in January 1975. She died one year and one month later, on 16 February 1976 in Moscow.

Units of the French Army were sent to the French Alps to clear an important route from central France to Italy. A critical choke point was the 2,080 metre (6,820 feet) high Authion massif, held by determined but weakened German and Italian forces. Field Marshal Harold Alexander authorised the assault on Authion on 10 April 1945.  The German defences on Authion massif  The Authion massif has a height of 2,080 metre (6,820 feet), it dominates about above the Alpine Valleys of Cairos, surrounded by steep slopes and deforested ravines. It is very difficult to access, only by a strategic path of switchbacks, containing mostly rocky ridges. This mountain range was crowned by important military works, namely Forca to the north and Milles Fourches to the south. These were strong, concrete protected forts topped with several meters of earth and locked by high gates and a deep ditch. There were also three towns in the northeast and east of the forts. Authion was therefore of decisive strategic importance in this part of the Alps. The German Command had made this alpine area the very basis of their defensive system. A Bavarian battalion of the 34th Infantry Division held the fortifications. The flanks of the massif were covered by artillery fire. German troop reserves were stationed in the Roya Valley and were ready to intervene at threatened points. These forts were also protected by important defensive works, namely trenches, dense networks of barbed wire and anti-tank mines.  Preparations  In the beginning of April 1945, the Command was informed that the Allies were to begin a general offensive on the Italian front. The offensive under the command of British Field Marshal Harold Alexander, was focused on capturing the highest point of the mountain. However, on that date the Germans were strongly established on all fronts and in particular on that of the Alps, so that no unit of the Axis could be beaten. The date of the offensive on the Authion was therefore set to 9 April 1945. Unfortunately, due to particularly unfavorable weather in the Alpine area, marked by heavy snowfall and a total lack of visibility, the attack would begin at the dawn of 10 April 1945. The 1st Free French Division had reinforced its infantry with several elements. Their mission was to lead the first part of the attack and then to capture the dominant peaks in the East as soon as possible. The battle M5 Stuart lost during the battle and preserved as a monument at Cabanes-Vieilles. At 09:15 on 10 April 1945, the French artillery stationed in Peira Cava, systematically shelled Fort de la Forca. The destruction brought on this objective, was relatively small. The projectiles were of inadequate size, not allowing the shelling to obtain significant results on those concrete structures that were particularly well protected. At 09:30, two companies of the Bataillon d'Infanterie de Marine du Pacifique (BIMP) departed from Tueis. One of the companies went to the crest of the spur located between Fort de la Forca and the Three Commons, the 2068-meter peak at the north of this spur. No progress beyond here was possible because of barbed wire and they were also under heavy fire by automatic weapons installed on the slope. The Piton northern spur quickly came under fire from the German armored turret so they couldn't move. However, they clung to the ground, making best use of the craters left by artillery shells, but many were killed while under fire from enemy mortars. The losses were increasing while the next arrival of reinforcements was 15 hours away, with only seven men operational on the ground. At 17:30, with the support of an assault section, the armored turret was destroyed and all the spur could then be occupied. The other company took advantage of the fierce fighting to infiltrate the mountain road towards Cabanes Vieilles, passing without getting caught in the fire of the Forts of Forca and Milles Fourches. The company Commander Barberot used a bulldozer to make the route passable for light tanks. Further to the right, a company of BMIX whose objective was the head of Vaiercaout, met with strong resistance from the enemy, forcing them to remain clinging on a slope and not reaching the top of this spur. Another company BMXI, climbing the rocky ridges of Mount Giagiabella was counterattacked on the way to its goal and had to retreat to its starting point. In the north a company of scout skiers RIA 3, attached to the battalion reached the summit of Rauss. Around 17 hours after the start of the battle the 4th Brigade from the Lower Camp Silver, allowed a company of the BM21 (reinforced with assault section) to remove the concrete structure of the Col de Rauss. To the south, the work of the 2nd Brigade to cover the right slope of the main operation was almost complete, and a group of 2nd Battalion North Africans (Commander Bertrand) seized Mangiapo and held it himself. At 19:00, a company of the 4th battalion (BM4) (Commander Buttin) occupied the top of Bosc. At noon a violent attack against the Germans starting from the Cross Cougoule, forced them to abandon the summit. Another company BM4, reinforced elements of an assault section, attacked le col de Brouis, but suffered heavy losses. The results of this first day were quite minor, the Allies could not bite significantly into the enemy's defensive system, and the casualties were quite severe: 66 killed and wounded. In the evening of the 10 April, Alexander decided to continue the offensive according to plan with a joint action on the Fort Miles Forts, by an assault group led by Lieutenant Colonel Lichtwitz. The assault group was a relatively recent creation at the time, specialised in the attacks of fortifications was armed with special weapons, especially bazookas and flamethrowers to complete the operation. The group had several assault sections, each section comprised six bazooka shooters, six submachine guns, grenade throwers, six flamethrowers and six machine guns. The section also had several light mortars with smoke shells. The battle on 11 April 1945 began with a series German counterattacks. At 03:00 the enemy vainly tried to regain one of the mountain tops. At 06:30 the BIMP section which occupied the northern peak of the spur of the Forca, suffered another attack and had to retreat. At 08:00 before the combined attack of BIMP and light tanks, the Germans abandoned the Cabanes Vieilles Camps. In the early afternoon, the BMXI held Parpella Vaiercaout. Four sections of the assault group, reinforced with two sections of BMXI, seized Fort Milles. At 15:00 the BMIP tried in vain to retake the north peak of the spur of Forca. In the evening of the second day, a serious breach was finally made in the defence system of Authion and the Allies could now walk on the massif. The enemy however, was seemingly unwilling to yield their positions to the French. Their reactions early in the day, were always very violent. At 09:00 a company within the BIMP was stopped before reaching the spur of Forca. At 18:00 the forts were abandoned by the enemy, who retired on Beole. At 20:30 the garrison of the Three Commons, violently subjected to the firing of artillery, surrendered. The enemy, at end of the day, began to falter. Prisoners confessed their astonishment at the presence of tanks in these places deemed impractical for such vehicles.  Aftermath  12 April 1945 marked the final day and success of the operation conducted on the Authion, which ended the Second World War in France and made a clear path for the Allies to Italy.

Notice the text underneath the images Text comics or a text comic is a form of comics where the stories are told in captions below the images and without the use of speech balloons. It is the oldest form of comics and was especially dominant in European comics from the 19th century until the 1950s, after which it gradually lost popularity in favor of comics with speech balloons. Definition A text comic is published as a series of illustrations that can be read as a continuous story. However, within the illustrations themselves no text is used: no speech balloons, no onomatopoeias, no written indications to explain where the action takes place or how much time has passed. In order to understand what is happening in the drawings the reader has to read the captions below each image, where the story is written out in the same style as a novel. Much like other comics text comics were pre-published in newspapers and weekly comics magazines as a continuous story, told in daily or weekly episodes. When published in book format the comics were sometimes published as actual illustrated novels. In some cases the original text was kept, but only a few drawings were used as illustrations, rather than the entire comic. In the Netherlands text comics were published in small rectangular books, called oblong books, due to the shape of the books. History Text comics are older than balloon comics. Ancient Egyptian wall paintings with hieroglyphs explaining the images are the oldest predecessors. In the late 17th century and early 19th century picture narratives were popular in Western Europe, such as Les Grandes Mis√®res de la guerre (1633) by Jacques Callot, History of the Hellish Popish Plot (1682) by Francis Barlow, the cartoons of William Hogarth, Thomas Rowlandson and George Cruikshank. These images provided visual stories which often placed captions below the images to explain a moral message. The earliest examples of text comics are the Swiss comics series Histoire de M. Vieux Bois (1827) by Rodolphe T√∂pffer, the French comics Les Travaux d'Hercule (1847), Trois artistes incompris et m√©contents (1851), Les D√©s-agr√©ments d'un voyage d'agr√©ment (1851) and L'Histoire de la Sainte Russie (1854) by Gustave Dor√©, the German Max und Moritz (1866) by Wilhelm Busch and the British Ally Sloper (1867) by Charles Henry Ross and √âmilie de Tessier. T√∂pffer often put considerable effort in the narrative captions of his graphic narratives, which made them just as distinctive and appealing as the drawings. Wilhelm Busch used rhyming couplets in his captions. During the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century text comics were the dominant form in Europe. In the United States of America the speech balloon made its entry in comics with 1895's The Yellow Kid by Richard F. Outcault. Frederick Burr Opper's Happy Hooligan and Alphonse and Gaston further popularized the technique. As speech balloons asked for less text to read and had the advantage of linking the dialogues directly to the characters who were speaking or thinking, they allowed readers to connect better with the stories. By the early 1900s most American newspaper comics had switched to the speech balloon format. While speech balloon comics became the norm in the United States, the format didn't always catch on as well in the rest of the world. In Mexico and Argentina speech balloons were adapted very quickly, while in Europe they remained a rarity until deep in the 1920s. In other parts of Europe, most notably the Netherlands, text comics even remained dominant as late as the early 1960s. Many European moral guardians looked down upon on comics as low-brow entertainment that made the youth too lazy to read. Christian comics magazines and newspapers closely supervised the content of their publications and preferred text comics, as the format still encouraged children to read actual written texts. They were also ideal to adapt classic novels and guide young readers towards \\"real\\" literature. In some instances foreign balloon comics were simply re-adapted by erasing the balloons and adding captions underneath them. It even happened with the European Tintin in the Land of the Soviets (1929) by Herg√©, which was republished in the French magazine Coeurs Vaillants, but with captions. Other comics, like Pip, Squeak and Wilfred by Bertram Lamb, used both speech balloons and captions. Under the Nazi, Fascist and Communist regimes in Western and/or Eastern Europe balloon comics were even banned in favor of comics with captions underneath them. The success of The Adventures of Tintin by Herg√© from 1929 on, influenced many other European comics, especially in the Franco-Belgian comics market, to adapt speech balloons. Translations of popular American comics such as Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Popeye throughout the 1930s and especially after the liberation of Europe in 1945 further encouraged the speech balloon format.

He had an extensive collection of insects, comprising several thousand samples, and perhaps one of the leading private collections at the time. Filmer developed a keen interest in field work that involved spiders and teamed with Dr. Ji≈ô√≠ Baum of the Prague Museum, the Czech zoologist and a leading world authority on spiders.Baum, Ji≈ô√≠. (1938). On the habits of the Australian spider Dinopis subrufus L. Koch. Mem Soc Vestnik Ceskoslovenske Zoologicke Spolecnosti Prague. (5): 28-32. Filmer performed research with Dr. Robin Tillyard on fossil insects.Tillyard, Robin John. (1917). Mesozoic and tertiary Insects of Queensland.

Upper Permian insects of New South Wales.Tillyard, Robin John. (1926). The Insects of Australia and New Zealand. He also teamed with John Mitchell, of Newcastle, on fossil trilobites, and was honored with a species being named after him.Mitchell, John. (1918). The Carboniferous trilobites of Australia. In Proc. Linn. Soc. NSW. 43(3): 437-494.Mitchell, J. (1919). On two new trilobites from Bowning. In Proceedings of the Linnean Society of New South Wales. (44): 441-449.Mitchell, John. (1919). Some additional trilobites from New South Wales. Proceedings of the Linnean Society of New South Wales. 44: 850-6. In 1930, Filmer collected 3 cestodes at Tuggerah from a fresh water tortoise, Chelodina longicollis, and submitted these to the South Australian Museum for identification. Thomas Harvey Johnston reported that this was the first known occurrence for an Amphilinid to be collected in the Southern Hemisphere, and the only known instance of a member of the order in a reptile, the other known species described, one example from sturgeons in the Northern Hemisphere, two from a primitive fresh-water fish from northern South America, and one from a marine fish off the coast of Ceylon.Johnston, T.

Proceedings of the Linnean Society of New South Wales. 59(1-2): 66-70. Accolades As previously mentioned, Filmer is credited in the animalia and insecta world with species named in his honor for significant contributions. Australia is one of the few countries to recognize a group of people for a major achievement where the group happened to work independently in different locations in Australia. These significant achievements by 3 individuals are disputed even to this day. Not the historical fact that the events occurred, but the claim of who accomplished what first, and who should receive credit for being the first in Australia to perform medical radiography. Australia Post decided a fair way was to depict all three individuals on a postage stamp, issued to coincided and commemorate the 100th anniversary of Wilhelm R√∂ntgen‚Äôs discovery of X-rays. On 7 September 1995, Father Joseph Patrick Slattery, Thomas Lyle, and Walter Drowley Filmer were recognized as the pioneers of X-ray technology in Australia.Smith, Tony. (2009).

In the Philippines, the song was released as a promotional single and distributed in limited quantities on CDs through Interscope Records. Produced by the band and William Orbit, \\"Making Out\\" was written by members Gwen Stefani, Tony Kanal, and Tom Dumont. While recording Rock Steady, the group aimed to work with a variety of musicians during sessions, unlike the processes they had endured for previous albums. Upon working with Orbit, they created a new wave and synth-pop song, with nods to electronic and Europop music. The lyrics find Stefani discussing her then- relationship with British singer Gavin Rossdale. She expresses a strong distaste for long-distance relationships and yearns for her lover to return home. Critically, \\"Making Out\\" drew a mostly negative response from music journalists. It was deemed overproduced and criticized for overly generic lyrics. Some reviewers, however, favorited it for being catchy and lyrically personal. Critics made comparisons between \\"Making Out\\" and Stefani's guest appearances on Moby's \\"South Side\\" in 2000 and Eve's \\"Let Me Blow Ya Mind\\" in 2001.  Background and release  Following the release of the band's fourth studio album, Return of Saturn in 2000, No Doubt set out immediately to begin work on their then-untitled fifth record. While creating the album, the band members refrained from playing instruments they were accustomed to, resulting in songs that contained less guitar and bass guitar, Tom Dumont and Tony Kanal's standard instruments, respectively. They experimented with a reggae sound in several songs, stemming from a creative trip to Jamaica they took in early 2001. While recording the album in both Jamaica and Los Angeles, No Doubt collaborated with a variety of songwriters and producers, in contrast to the creative sessions for previous studio albums such as Return of Saturn. During one session, they worked with English musician William Orbit who was best known for working with Madonna on her electronica-influenced seventh studio album, Ray of Light (1998). The track was recorded using the digital audio workstation program Pro Tools, which allowed the group to easily work with other producers in Jamaica and London simultaneously. The title of \\"Making Out\\" was first revealed as part of the track listing for Rock Steady on October 15, 2001, via No Doubt's official website. Orbit's association with the track as a producer was also revealed. The Orbit and No Doubt-produced track was written by Gwen Stefani, Dumont, and Kanal. \\"Making Out\\" was initially released to the public with the rest of Rock Steady on December 11, 2001. Despite not being released as a commercial single, the song was released as a promotional single in the Philippines in 2002 and distributed in limited quantities as a CD single. In the physical release handled by Interscope Records, the album version of \\"Making Out\\" appears as the first track while the previously unreleased Sharam Jey Mix of No Doubt's 2003 single \\"Running\\" serves as the bonus track.  Composition and lyrics  The lyrics of \\"Making Out\\" revolve around Gwen Stefani's relationship with her then-boyfriend Gavin Rossdale. Musically, \\"Making Out\\" is a new wave and synth-pop song with an electronic beat. It also contains a rhythm developed alongside an electronically-produced hand clap. Jesse Berrett from Spin referred to the song as an example of the consistent presence of new wave music on Rock Steady; he also noted the use of synths in \\"Making Out\\" and described it as a \\"squirt [of] Europop\\". Natalie Nichols, a journalist for the Los Angeles Times wrote that Rock Steady is primarily an upbeat album with influence from dance music and considered \\"Making Out\\" to be No Doubt's closest attempt at creating an electronica-inspired dance song. Lisa Oliver, a member of Yahoo! Music Radio's LAUNCHcast program, compared No Doubt's song to American singer Rockwell's 1984 single \\"Somebody's Watching Me\\". According to the official sheet music published by Musicnotes.com, \\"Making Out\\" is set in common time and has a moderately fast dance tempo of 120 beats per minute. The key of the song is in D major, with Stefani's vocal range spanning an entire octave, from E3 to D5 in scientific pitch notation. The song progresses in the chord progressions of G‚ÄìD‚ÄìA‚ÄìE in the verses, although a slight distortion is used on the bass. The chorus follows the same set-up, minus the distortion. Instrumentation is provided by No Doubt: Dumont and Kanal perform keyboards in addition to serving as guitarist and bass guitarist, respectively, while Adrian Young plays the drums. Clif Norrell serves as head engineer, assisted by the team of Jeff Kanan, Jennifer Young and mix editors Matt Fields, David Treahearn, and Keith Uddin. A central theme on Rock Steady is Stefani's relationship with British musician Gavin Rossdale. In several of the album's songs, Stefani sings about her impatience with him and her wanting to establish mutual trust. Lyrically, \\"Making Out\\" finds Stefani expressing her dislike of long-distance relationships and requesting for her lover to return home. Disappointed by the absence of her man, she rejects his acts of kindness (\\"The flowers arrive to my surprise / But that just ain't good enough\\") and instead conveys a feeling of lovesickness. Upon his arrival home, she predicts to endure kissing sessions to atone for lost time. With widely simple lyrics, Stefani sings in the chorus: \\"I'm really missing you in so many ways / I anticipate us making out\\".  Critical reception  Upon its release, \\"Making Out\\" received generally negative reviews from music critics. Rob Sheffield from Rolling Stone was disappointed by \\"Making Out\\" and Rock Steady track \\"In My Head\\", calling both of them lame. Regarding No Doubt's role of songwriting in \\"Making Out\\", The A.V. Clubs Stephen Thompson criticized Stefani for not being profound; he wrote that the lyrics do not \\"get much more involved than \\"'I anticipate us making out'\\". Oliver from LAUNCHcast agreed, declaring \\"Making Out\\" as lyrically dreadful. Joe Costa, a reviewer for Sputnikmusic, disliked the song's overproduction and unfavorably compared it to other Stefani releases. Despite the unfavorable reviews for \\"Making Out\\", it drew praise from Spins Berrett who referred to the song as insanely catchy. Some reviewers drew comparisons between \\"Making Out\\" and Stefani's solo work up to 2002, such as her guest appearance on the remix of Moby's \\"South Side\\" (2000) and her duet with Eve titled \\"Let Me Blow Ya Mind\\" in 2001. Sputnikmusic's Costa described \\"Making Out\\" as a potential B-side to one of Stefani's duets. Eden Miller, writing for PopMatters, made this juxtaposition as well and considered it a favorite among the Rock Steady tracks for sounding exceptionally personal.

The grounds comprise of undulating deer park on the lower slopes of the Clent Hills. They were redeveloped and landscaped between about 1739 and 1764, with follies designed by John Pitt (of Encombe), Thomas Pitt, James \\"Athenian\\" Stuart, and Sanderson Miller.\\"Hagley Hall\\" in Historic England Planned as part of an 18th-century enthusiasm for landscape gardening, especially among poets, the park brought many distinguished literary visitors to admire the views, as well as poetic tributes to their beauty and Classical taste. The appeal of the past A park adjacent to the former manor house at Hagley was mentioned in the 14th century as having an embanked ditch as boundary, traces of which still remain.Tom Pagett, Introduction to the History of Hagley, Hagley Historical and Field Society 1997, \\"Getting a living from the land\\" The grounds eventually fell into disuse and were only renewed at the end of 17th century by Charles Lyttelton. It was his grandson George, however, who was chiefly responsible for landscaping them in the Neoclassical taste and making them one of the foremost examples of the style in England.William Scott, Stourbridge and Its Vicinity, pp.258-9] In particular he started a tradition of abandoning the European taste for formal gardens, incorporating instead the natural beauty of the landscape. The charm of the grounds was further underlined by the creation of buildings in diverse styles: some that recreated ancient Greek and Roman examples, another being a gothic folly. About the grounds were various inscriptions underlining the fact that this was a literary landscape which reflected the shaping vision of some of the leading poets of the 18th century.Joe Hawkins, \\"Hagley Park History\\" Because the grounds were wide and extended up valleys and over wooded hillsides, it was impossible to take in the whole as a single vista. Instead there was a circuit often described in contemporary works, such as the introduction to Thomas Maurice‚Äôs Hagley: A Descriptive Poem (Oxford 1776), which guided the reader along a route through alternating light and shade, open and closed prospects, rises and descents.Maurice 1776, pp.13-21 Along the way were memorials to poets that commanded outlooks either across an open area within the park, such as that from Pope's Seat, or else down to the Hall and then across to the distant hills beyond, as from Milton's seat. On the south- eastern boundary there was access to an even wider prospect from the summit of Clent Hill, where yet another memorial was erected. It consisted of four rough-hewn pillars, the so-called Ossian‚Äôs Tomb, known also as the Druid's Temple or later simply as the Four Stones.Photo online A 19th century pencil sketch of the Park showing Hagley Hall, the Temple of Theseus and Wychbury Obelisk Another series of prospects was associated with Wychbury Hill to the north, towards which the old road to Halesowen climbed in a hollow way from between the church and the former site of the Hall.William Harris, Clentine Rambles, p.14 On the slope immediately overlooking the new Hall was a column, originally the gift of George Lyttelton's old employer, Frederick, Prince of Wales, which was moved to that position as a memorial following the prince's death in 1751. Photo Beyond that was the Wychbury Obelisk, raised in 1764 to various members of the Lyttelton family. On the way there was the Temple of Theseus built for George Lyttelton‚Äòs father by James Stuart in imitation of the ancient Temple of Hephaestus at Athens.Calder Loth, \\"The Hephaisteion and its adaptations\\" Its purpose was to serve both as a landscape feature visible from the Hall and to \\"command a most beautiful View of the Country\\" round about.Susan Weber Soros (ed.), James ‚ÄúAthenian‚Äù Stuart: The Rediscovery of Antiquity (Yale University Press, 2006), quoted on p. 323 Along the course of the old road on its way there was the rectory, and near it Jacob's Well, the original water source for the Hall,Photo online and a quarry that produced the stone known as Hagley-rag. Above the quarry was the site of Thomson‚Äôs Seat, at one time an octagonal building in a grove before it was destroyed by the fall of a tree.Historic England, \\"Hagley Hall\\" The circuit of the grounds as described by Thomas Maurice began at the parish church, which in the 18th century was entirely lost behind trees, and took a path \\"to a gloomy hollow, whose steep banks are covered with large rocky stones, as if rent asunder by some violent concussion of nature.\\" On the bank above was an elegant Palladian bridge from which one looked up along a sequence of three lakes one above the other to a Rotunda (the work of John Pitt in about 1748) crowning the valley's head. This was a circular Ionic structure, also known as Pope's Temple in the past.The Mirror of Literature, Amusement and Instruction, 14.382, 1829 On the bridge itself (a later work by Thomas Pitt) were lines by Catullus recalling the Classical Vale of Tempe overhung by woods (Tempe quae sylvae cingunt superimpendentes).Carmen LXIV, 286 Ascending the left bank, one reached a grotto of \\"grotesque stone alcoves and seats shaded with laurels\\" above a cascade decorated with glittering vitrified slag from the old glass industry in the area. Beyond that was the first memorial to an English poet in the circuit, a tall stone urn dedicated to William Shenstone.Wiki-Commons A further climb through woods brought one to open grassland and another urn dedicated to Alexander Pope beyond the Rotunda. From there a woodland walk climbed to an ivy-covered castellated ruin, completed in 1748 and designed by Sanderson Miller. Photo online The Gothic style windows of this are said to have been transferred from the remains of Halesowen Abbey.A History of the County of Worcester, Volume 3 pp.130-36 Of the castle's four towers, only one was intact and that was inhabited at the period by the park keeper. Continuing within the park, rather than leaving by the gate to Clent Hill, one next encountered a pebble-floored rustic hermitage composed of roots and moss and near it a curved seat of contemplation with its Latin name (sedes contemplationis) spelled out in snail shells. The design for this may even have been Alexander Pope's and was associated with a description of such a retreat in Milton's Il Penseroso.Gordon Campbell, The Hermit in the Garden: From Imperial Rome to Ornamental Gnome, Oxford University 2013, pp.119-22 Leaving this haven, the path descended and then climbed to Milton's Seat itself, with its panoramic view.Photo online From there one returned downhill to the Hall. Up until the mid-19th century the park was generally open to the public, \\"And citizens who take the air/ Full oft to Hagley Park repair,\\" a local author observed.Thomas Sewell Allen, A Trip to Paris: In Verses (Dudley 1831) p.94 No doubt some carried with them one or other of the tourist guides published at the time. But because of the vandalism caused by some visitors, only supervised access was allowed thereafter.William Harris, Clentine Rambles, p.18 Time, the weather and neglect were also taking their toll over the years, causing some features in the grounds to disappear completely. Only comparatively recently has restoration work begun, starting with the Wychbury Obelisk in 2011. More recently the Palladian Bridge was rebuilt and the vista opened up the valley to the repaired Rotunda at its head.Natural England 2014 Paths are now being brought back into use, and new trees planted, in preparation for opening the park up once again.Bromsgrove Advertiser, 21 August 2015 A poetical landscape The development of the 18th century English park was the product of those educated in the Classics during the Augustan age, men whose imagination had been taught to interpret a landscape through the eyes of the Latin and Greek poets, and also in part by the Classical landscapes of Claude Lorrain and Nicolas Poussin. Peter De Bolla, The Education of the Eye: Painting, Landscape, and Architecture in Eighteenth- century Britain, Stanford University Press, 2003, especially Chapter 3: \\"The Leasowes and Hagley Park, a school for taste\\" Although examples from neither of those painters were to be found in Hagley Hall, in the parlour there hung Arcadian landscapes by their later Baroque counterpart, Francesco Zuccarelli,Heely, 1777, p.12 and visitors to Hagley certainly compared aspects of the grounds to paintings by Poussin. Jacob's Well reminded Horace Walpole of \\"the Samaritan Woman's in a picture of Nicolo Poussin,\\"Quoted in Hagley Historical Society Newsletter 3 while James Heely found in the prospect uphill to the Prince's Column \\"a landscape that would do honour to the pencil of Poussin ‚Äì an inexpressible glow of the sublime and beautiful, in all the fullness of their powers\\".Heely 1777, p.24 Chiefly, though, the landscaping of Hagley Park was a poetical project. Among visitors were Alexander Pope, who had developed his own more modest grounds at Twickenham, and William Shenstone who, in addition to his work on his own property at The Leasowes, helped develop the garden at the neighbouring Enville Hall.Recollection of Some Particulars in the Life of the late William Shenstone, London 1788, Other poets with an interest in garden development who wrote poetical tributes to Hagley were William Mason and Richard Meadowcourt (1695‚Äì1760).\\"To Sir George Lyttelton on his house at Hagley\\" One other visitor was Henrietta Knight, Lady Luxborough who, while she lived, was at the centre of the circle of local landscaping poets, and who came to view the newly constructed \\"Giant's Castle\\" in 1748.Letters written by the Late Right Honourable Lady Luxborough to William Shenstone Esq, London 1775, p.45 Lord Lyttelton was himself a poet and erected monuments about the grounds to those poets whom he admired and counted as his friends: Shenstone, Pope, Thomson, Milton. The inclusion of the last of these was an aesthetic announcement of the new taste in landscape gardening there which, eschewing European artificiality, took its lead from the description of Eden in the fourth book of Paradise Lost.The Genius of the Place: The English Landscape Garden, 1620-1820, MIT Press 1988, p.79 In his essay on \\"The History of the Modern Taste in Gardening\\" (1780), Horace Walpole was to commend Milton's description as \\"a warmer and more just picture of the present style than Claude Lorrain could have painted from Hagley or Stourhead\\", going on then to apply Milton's lines on the management of water to the principal garden vista at Hagley ::::Which through veins ::Of porous earth with kindly thirst updrawn, ::Rose a fresh fountain and with many a rill ::Water‚Äôd the garden; then united fell ::Down the steep glade.Anecdotes of Painting in England, Vol.4, p.268 In addition, lines from Milton appeared at two other sites in the park. Within the Hermitage was inscribed the description of the \\"mossy cell\\" to which the devotee of melancholy will withdraw, taken from Il Penseroso; while on Milton's Seat, with its broad outlook over the countryside, appeared the passage beginning \\"These are thy glorious works, parent of good\\" from the fifth book of Paradise Lost.Heely 1777, pp.95-102 \\"The British Tempe\\" on an early 19th century serving plate William Mason, author of a poetical essay on The English Garden (1772-82), had earlier taken up the criticism of artificiality (also present in Milton) in his \\"Ode to a water nymph\\" (1758), Text online particularly the way water was forced from its natural course and into regularity. The poem then ends in a compliment to Lyttelton‚Äòs water vista at Hagley as the principal example of naturalness. But even before Lyttelton had begun work on it in the valley above his house, James Thomson had recognised its Classical possibilities and christened it ::The British Tempe! There along the dale, ::With woods o'er- hung, and shagg'd with mossy rocks, ::Whence on each hand the gushing waters play; ::And down the rough cascade white-dashing fall, ::Or gleam in lengthened vista thro' the trees.lines 905-10 This was written following his first visit to Hagley in 1743 and introduced the following year into the Spring section of his revised The Seasons. Only in 1762 did work on the Palladian Bridge begin, when Lyttelton followed Thomson's lead by incorporating there the reference to the Vale of Tempe by Catullus. Remote echoes of Thomson's evocation are heard in the \\"ever murmuring streams and ever tinkling rills\\" of Richard Meadowcourt's address to Lyttelton and in the diminished sound of \\"each tinkling rill\\" in Anthony Pasquin‚Äôs \\"Verses written at Hagley on the 4th of December, 1788\\".Quoted in A Companion to the Leasowes, Hagley, and Enville, 1789 Pasquin also recalled the distinguished poetic visitors to the place, as did Mary Leadbeater in her lilting \\"On a visit to Hagley Park\\".Poems, Dublin and London 1808, pp.239-40 But these would be mere distractions to the youthful Romanticism of Chauncy Hare Townshend in his \\"Sonnet on visiting Hagley\\". Ardent admiration forgives what is now perceived as the artifice of 18th century landscaping, and forgets the literary associations of a bygone age, as it responds naturally to the handiwork of \\"Nature's God\\".Poems, London 1821, p.296 But Townshend only echoes misgivings expressed (though more diplomatically) by earlier visitors. Thomas Maurice exclaims ::Ah, Lyttelton, in vain thy fancy strives ::To imitate, where real nature lives ‚Äì ::For still in spite of thee, in spite of art, ::Her antient spirit breathes thro‚Äô every part.Maurice 1776, p.23 And James Heely follows him at greater length: One other person's name was linked with Hagley Park, that of Lucy (born Fortescue), George Lyttelton's first wife,Fortescue genealogy who died in 1746, before the park's main development. Thomson represents her as accompanying her husband on walks about the grounds, although under the poetic name of Lucinda.\\"Spring\\", lines 934-46 The association was deepened by Lyttelton's monody \\"To the memory of a lady lately deceased\\", which is set in the grounds at the start, and whose fifth stanza, beginning \\"O Shades of Hagley, where is now your Boast?\\" was particularly admired.Text online In its wake came references to Lyttelton's sorrow as the burden of Hagley's streams in Mason's \\"Ode to a Water Nymph\\" and to his monody in Maurice's descriptive poem. The English private parks that developed in the 18th century coincided with a consciousness of national identity and self- confidence.Jill Franklin, \\"The Liberty of the Park\\", chapter 9 in Patriotism: The Making and Unmaking of British National Identity, Routledge 1989 That Lord Lyttelton, the creator of Hagley, was a patriot dedicated to the national good was a theme developed by several of the poets who invoked the place: by Thomson, as being one of the themes taking Lyttelton's mind from appreciation of the beauty surrounding him; by Mason, whose ode closes with a compliment to Lyttelton's parliamentary performance; and by James Woodhouse, who conceives of Hagley as a place where the patriotic lord can withdraw from the tawdry temptations of the capital.\\"To the Right Honourable Lord Lyttelton: an epistle\\", Dodsley 1766, pp.139 ‚Äì 161 Maurice's descriptive poem dated from after Lyttelton's death and closed with the patriotic hope that Britain will triumph against its continental rivals, lately allied against it during the American Revolutionary War. Some three years later, at a time of damaged national confidence, the second Baron Lyttleton finds in Hagley a place of retreat from Parliamentary strife and ambition.\\"Retirement\\" in Poems, by a Young Nobleman, of Distinguished Abilities, Lately Deceased, London 1780, pp.51-55 Though poetic tributes to the park were to continue, the past glories that were its inspiration are only memories now. The place ::Where Thomson sang in songs sublime, ::And Pope and Lyttelton could rhyme, ::And still where modern bards resort,Thomas Sewell Allen, A Trip to Paris, p.93 had become a tourist attraction.

Life and work Rosemarie Castoro (1939-2015) was an American artist who worked in drawing, painting, sculpture, and other mediums. She was associated with Minimalism, Conceptual art, and concrete poetry. Castoro was a pioneer of monochrome painting and abstraction. Movement of the human body through physical space was a recurring theme in her work. In the 1960s, she participated in several performances with Minimal Dance pioneer Yvonne Rainer and became involved with the study of choreography at the Pratt Institute. Castoro graduated from the Pratt Institute, Cum Laude, with a BFA in 1963. In the 1970s, Castoro developed a strong focus on sculpture. In 1971, she created a series of giant minimal sculptures called Free Standing Wall Pieces which encouraged performative interaction. The surfaces of the panels are treated with graphite, gesso and marble dust, thickly applied creating massive rough brush strokes. According to a statement made by her gallery representative, ‚Äúshe was acutely aware that women artists working in a formalist style milieu were not spared the gender-based dismissal of the time,‚Äù even while she remained ‚Äústrictly dedicated to her non-representational abstract style of work.‚Äù  Rosemarie Castoro at Artpark  Castoro‚Äôs work, ‚ÄúFlashers‚Äù, is featured in the 1979 poster of Artpark under the title, \\"Public Sculpture for the Post-Heroic Age\\".Artpark. ‚ÄúArtpark ‚Äô79‚Äù poster. 1979.

The concept was first developed in 2013, before funding via Kickstarter meant the product could be taken to market. The purpose of Holus is to simulate holographic experiences and is technically different from typical hologram stickers found on credit cards and currency notes. Holus has been criticized by some commentators as a revamping Pepper's ghost, a 19th-century optical trick. History Holus was developed in late 2013 by a team in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Shortly before H+ Tech began looking for funding for the device, Holus won a number of awards for its design. This included he Vancouver User Experience Award in the non-profit category for partnering up with Ronald McDonald House to build Magic Room and the Peoples Choice Award to achieve excellence in joy, elegance, and creativity. Its first major coverage came from a review by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in early 2015. At the time, the technology was demonstrated to bring animals to life within the 3D glass box. The product was referred to in the review as roughly the \\"size of a microwave\\". The concept went on to win two awards at the NextBC awards in Canada in early 2015. In order to build mass versions of the product, a Kickstarter campaign was launched in order to take the idea to market. It used a similar technology to the optical illusion known as Pepper's ghost. This drew criticism from some during its Kickstarter campaign. It launched its Kickstarter campaign in June 2015 and generated twice its target of $40,000 within the first 48 hours. The technology is similar to the technology used to display the music artists Tupac Shakur and Michael Jackson. Since then the technology has advanced, with a number of startups entering the market. One of these was H+ Technology, who first began working on the technology in early 2013. The aim of the product at the time has remained the same until today, to produce 3D technology that can be used in the home on a tabletop. Research and development Due to the technology being in its infancy, the media has covered the R&D; of the product and its potential. Spatial light modulators have been mentioned as one potential development on future versions of Holus. The University of British Columbia and Simon Fraser University have both assisted with the research work of such displays.

She has held numerous showings of her work throughout the country and several pieces have been acquired by museums, including LACMA, the Smithsonian American Art Museum, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and the RISD Museum. Biography Sabrina Gschwandtner was born in 1977 in Washington, DC. She studied at the in Salzburg, Austria under the direction of Valie Export and also with Vlada Petric, founder of the Harvard Film Archive. She earned a Bachelor of Arts with honors in art/semiotics from Brown University in 2000 and in 2008 she received her Master of Fine Arts from Bard College. She is the author of the book Knitknit : Profiles + Projects from Knitting's New Wave. Artworks and techniques Gschwandtner uses film, video, photography, and textiles as her mediums. She sews together filmstrips to create a quilt-like textile. She then installs them with led lights behind them so the viewer can see through the filmstrips when looking up close. She began sewing filmstrips together in 2009 when a friend of hers gave her 16 mm films from Anthology Film Archives that were no longer of use to the Fashion Institute of Technology. Gschwandtner uses documentaries about ‚Äúart, craft, fashion, decoration, vocation, military camouflage, feminist expression, and scientific metaphor‚Äù in her artworks, mostly from the 1950s-80s. Many of the short documentary films recognized and admired women‚Äôs role in craft making, such as knitting, crocheting, and fabric dyeing. After she watches the films, she cuts and sews them together in patterns that resemble popular American quilt motifs. She has made several works in a \\"crazy quilt\\" pattern. Leah Ollman of the LA Times wrote in a 2017 review: \\"Gschwandtner unites the strips in traditional quilt patterns ‚Äî interlocking triangles and diamonds set within squares, energetic designs that play surface against depth, control against abandon. She makes astute use of color, mixing vivid stretches of jade, yellow and cerulean with the faded hues of old footage, all accented with black countdown leader and lengths of toned emptiness.\\" Gschwandtner uses quilts because they symbolize and celebrate \\"the undervalued work of female laborers and artisans, largely overlooked.\\" . Film Archivist Andrew Lampert says that her work is able to \\"greatly expand our notion of film editing, narrative and the moving image.\\" Other works include films and installations for specific sites. For example, Gschwandtner created ‚ÄúCrochet Film‚Äù (2004) specifically for a show \\"Group Loop,\\" put together by Christoph Cox about repetition and cycles. Her piece featured two loops, one, a film of the artist crocheting and the other a crocheted piece representing a film loop. Another series of work on the same theme is \\"The History of String\\" which compares the spooling mechanism of a sewing machine to \\"early film projectors.\\" Collections and exhibitions Gschwandtner ‚Äòs work has been exhibited worldwide at institutions, such as the Renwick Gallery of the Smithsonian American Art Museum (Washington D.C.), the Museum of Arts and Design (New York), and the Victoria and Albert Museum (London).

In 19th century Buenos Aires cattle were frequently killed in open air yards, as illustrated in Vidal, 34 and described in Hudson, 286.), is a short story by the Argentine poet and essayist Esteban Echeverr√≠a (1805-1851). It was the first Argentine work of prose fiction. It is one of the most studied texts in Latin American literature.

A printed English translation by Norman Thomas di Giovanni has been published.Together with miscellaneous notes; published under the title \\"The Slaughteryard\\", The Friday Project, . The following is an English-language pr√©cis of the original Spanish text. Plot The action takes place on some unspecified date in the 1830s during the season of Lent. The City of Buenos Aires has been isolated by floods. Pounding their pulpits, the preachers thunder that the Day of Judgement is nigh; that God is angry with the wickedness of man ‚Äì and, more especially, with the heretical unitarios (adherents of the proscribed Unitario political party). Eventually the floods abate but not before the city has run out of beef. The government gives orders that 50 bullocks are to be slaughtered, ostensibly to provide beef for children and the sick (for otherwise meat is forbidden to Catholics during Lent). The reader is given to understand that the meat is really intended for privileged persons including Rosas himself and his corrupt clergy. Echeverr√≠a proceeds to paint the slaughter yard scene in lurid colours: in the pens, the cattle stuck in the glutinous mud; the blood- smeared, half-naked butchers ‚Äì brutal men, staunch Rosas supporters to a man; the hideous black female offal-scavengers; the growling mastiffs; the screaming carrion birds; the riotous youths who amuse themselves by pelting the females and each other with lumps of bloody meat or guts; the cynical, bestial language. On a ruinous shed there are signboards declaiming: \\"Long live the Federation\\"; \\"Long live the RestorerCynically, the dictator Rosas demanded that he be called the \\"Restorer of the Laws\\". and the heroine do√±a Encarnaci√≥n Ezcurra\\";Rosas' late wife: behind the scenes she had played a powerful role in politics. \\"Death to the savage unitarios\\". Presiding there is the sinister Judge of the Slaughter Yard. By order of Rosas the Judge enjoys absolute power over this collection of debased humanity. Forty-nine bullocks are slaughtered, flayed and quartered with axes. One more animal remains. But there is a suspicion that he may be no bullock, but a bull ‚Äì though bulls are not allowed in the slaughter yard. Driven mad with rage by the crowd's handling, he charges. A horseman lassoes him but owing to an accident the taut lasso decapitates a child. The animal escapes and heads off to the city, pursued by a crowd, which, incidentally, tramples a passing Englishman.It is mentioned that the Englishman is himself the owner of a slaughter yard. For the favourable opinion Rosas enjoyed among English residents of Buenos Aires see Hudson, 126. After an hour the animal is recaptured, taken back to the slaughter yard and despatched in horrific terms by the butcher Matasiete (the name means braggart, bully, literally \\"he kills seven\\"). The \\"bullock\\" is then cut open and proves after all to possess an enormous pair of retracted testicles ‚Äì much to the amusement of the crowd, which by now has forgotten the decapitated boy. At this point the chief protagonist, who is never named but is a man of about 25, enters the scene. The crowd immediately spots that he is a unitario (supporter of the proscribed political party). His sideburns are cut in the form of a letter U (for unitario); he is not displaying the mandatory rosista emblem; neither is he wearing the obligatory mourning for Rosas' late wife. (It is not explained why the protagonist has chosen to ride about Buenos Aires dressed in this illegal, indeed reckless manner.) Furthermore, his horse bears a silla or gringo saddleThat is, a leather saddle of the general type normal in Europe or North America; locals used the recado, a type of sheepskin saddle. ‚Äì in the crowd's mentality, the sure sign of the effete city slicker. Egged on by the crowd, Matasiete throws him from his horse, seizes him by the necktie and holds a dagger to his throat. \\"Cut his throat, Matasiete\\" jeers the crowd. At that point the slaughter yard Judge rides up and orders that the protagonist be taken to his shed, which is also a rudimentary courtroom. In this room is a massive table never without glasses of grog and playing cards \\"unless to make room for the executions and tortures of the Federalist thugs of the slaughter yard\\". After the crowd has shouted threats and ribald insults the Judge orders everyone to shut up and sit down. There then transpires an angry dialogue between (on the one hand) the Judge and taunting crowd and (on the other) the defiant, brave but rather high- minded protagonist. The Judge and the crowd speak in direct, colloquial street Spanish but, curiously, the protagonist, even when insulting them, uses correct literary language, addressing them in the third person. At last the Judge delivers his ruling: \\"Drop this city slicker's underpants and give him the vergeThe Spanish word verga can mean \\"rod\\" but also \\"cock\\". to his bald buttocks\\". The reader is assumed to understand the inward significance of the word Mazorca (mazorca is Spanish for \\"corncob\\": the corncob is the Mazorca's chosen instrument of torture by rectal insertion). The protagonist is violently stretched out on the torture-table and he develops paroxysms of uncontrollable rage, demanding to have his throat cut rather than submit to this indignity. After a terrible struggle the young man bursts a blood vessel and dies on the spot. The Judge comments: \\"Poor devil; we only wanted to amuse ourselves, but he took it too seriously.\\" Significance in Latin American literature According to the American editor, translator and Borges collaborator Norman Thomas di Giovanni, \\"Esteban Echeverr√≠a‚Äôs El matadero, written towards the end of the 1830s, is chronologically the first work of Argentine prose fiction‚Ä¶. Owing in part to its brevity ‚Äì a mere 6,000 or so words ‚Äì it may be the most studied school text in all Latin American literature. It is certainly known and acclaimed beyond the borders of Argentina.\\"di Giovanni. For Borges himself, who wrote a foreword to one edition, \\"In Echeverr√≠a's text there is a sort of hallucinatory realism, which can recall the great shadows of Hugo and Herman Melville\\".Borges (in Spanish) \\"If one text has exercised a decisive influence in Argentine literature and art, it seems to be The Slaughter Yard, spearhead of a large number of editions and studies, and seed of a still-prevailing movement where new readings and meanings are sought.\\"Guarino (in Spanish). A 1998 survey of U.S. universities found the work was required graduate reading at 73% of Ph.D.-granting Spanish faculties, the highest score for any Spanish American nineteenth century work of fiction.Brown and Johnson, 1, 16.Brown and Johnson obtained results for the 56 top-rated faculties. (They mistakenly classified El matadero as a novel instead of a short story, but it would have scored top in either category.) Echeverr√≠a's oeuvre extends to five printed volumes,Gutierrez, 1. but his literary prestige chiefly depends on this single short story.Pupo-Walker, 402. Historicity Although The Slaughter Yard is a story, it is based on some elements of fact. English-speaking memorialists described the setting (the south Matadero shown in the Vidal image) and their accounts corroborate many of Echeverr√≠a's details.Vidal, 34-40.Hudson, 286-7.Hutchinson, 27-33. The clergy indeed upheld Rosas' dictatorship.Rosas kept papal jurisdiction out of Argentina and appointed the clergy himself: he expected it to serve the Federalist cause. In fact, the clergy willingly supported the Rosas regime, except for the Jesuits, whom he later expelled for that reason (Lynch, 84-85). It was indeed compulsory to display rosista emblems including \\"Death to the savage unitarios.Men were obliged to wear red silk badges with the inscription: \\"Long live the Argentine Confederation. Death to the Savage Unitarians\\". (Lynch, 83). The butchers in the slaughter yards were indeed staunch Rosas supporters and did supply thugs for his Mazorca.Di Meglio. The Mazorca did use the corncob as an instrument of torture.Lynch,100; Hadfield, 291). Further, according to Guti√©rrezGuti√©rrez, 213. > The scene of the \\"savage unitario\\" in the power of the Judge of the > Slaughter Yard and his myrmidons is not an invention but a reality that > happened more than once in that ill-fated era. The only thing in this > picture that can have been the author's invention would be the moral > appreciation of the circumstances, the language and the victim's conduct, > which functions as the noble poet would have done himself in an analogous > situation. Writing and publication=Traditional view It is usually saidSee e.g. Carla, 48-9. that Echeverr√≠a wrote \\"The Slaughter Yard\\" at some time in 1838-40. Although he had fled to Uruguay the long arm of Rosas could still reach him there; according to Echeverr√≠a's friend Juan Mar√≠a Guti√©rrez, who was afterwards rector of the University of Buenos Aires, \\"If the story had fallen into the hands of Rosas its author would have disappeared immediately.\\" Guti√©rrez, who said he personally examined the manuscript, added: > He well knew the risk he was running, but it could have been rage, more than > fear, that produced his trembling handwriting , which is almost illegible in > the original manuscript.Guti√©rrez, 213. It was Guti√©rrez who edited the work for publication in 1871.Revista del R√≠o de la Plata, I, 563-585: Carilla, 585. Challenge to the traditional view That Echeverr√≠a did not publish the story because he feared assassination even in Uruguay was denied by Caba√±as, who pointed out that Echeverr√≠a did publish other works which, he claimed, were equally offensive.Caba√±as, 133-4. Rather, the story did not fit Echeverr√≠a's aesthetic sensibility. The traditional view as to dating and authorship was challenged by Emilio Carilla in 1993.Carilla, 30. Carilla acknowledged that Guti√©rrez had a venerable reputation as a man of letters. But he pointed out that Gutierrez had a habit of unilaterally \\"correcting\\" the works of the authors he edited (for editors of that era, his was a not uncommon failing); supplying copious examples. He also noted that ‚Äì according to his own admission: in a private letter to Alberdi ‚Äì Guti√©rrez wrote and published a detailed book review of Sarmiento's Facundo before he had read the book! As regards \\"The Slaughter Yard\\", said Carilla: #The manuscript of the story has never been found. #It cannot be found amongst Gutierrez's collection of Echeverr√≠a's papers. #There is no positive evidence that the manuscript was ever seen by anyone, apart from Guti√©rrez and (presumably) Echeverr√≠a himself. #Therefore, critics have had to take Gutierrez's text and account on trust. #Before 1871, when discussing Echeverr√≠a's works, Gutierrez not so much as mentioned the most important item: \\"The Slaughter Yard\\". Presumably, he did not acquire the MS until about that year. #In his own writings Echeverr√≠a never mentioned \\"The Slaughter Yard\\" either. Therefore, for Carilla, it was surprising that critics had assumed \\"The Slaughter Yard\\" was composed around 1838-40: that was merely the time in which the story was set. It could equally well have been written at any time up to Echeverr√≠a's death in 1851 ‚Äì shortly before the dictator Rosas was overthrown. Hence, although it was tempting to regard \\"The Slaughter House\\" as a work composed at the height of Rosas' state terrorism, there was really no evidence that it was. Carllla then turned to Gutierrez's editorial notes on the story. According to Gutierrez, the manuscript had not been intended for publication but as a sketch for a poem Echeverr√≠a had intended to write, \\"as is proved by the haste and carelessness with which it had been drawn up\\". But that, said Carilla, is absurd, for the published text of \\"The Slaughter Yard\\" is pretty well flawless. We may therefore suspect that Gutierrez himself had to do with the composition of the story. And the proof is in the story's last paragraph: > In those days the throat-cutting butchers of the Slaughter Yard were the > advocates who spread the rosista Federation by rod and dagger ... They used > to call a savage unitario ... anyone who was not a cutthroat, butcher, nor > savage, nor thief, every decent man with a good heart, every enlightened > patriot friend of light and liberty ... That, said Carilla, must have been written after the Rosas dictatorship, and by Gutierrez himself. Guti√©rrez was a collaborator, a joint author of \\"The Slaughter Yard\\". Genre There is endless discussion about the literary type or genre to which \\"The Slaughter House\\" belongs: story, novel of manners, essay or hybrid.Caba√±as, 133. For German scholar Christian Wehr, \\"The Slaughter Yard\\" is the foundational text of an autochthonous Latin American genre he called Diktatorenromans : the dictator novel.Wehr, 310. Vernacular dialogue As noted, the protagonist speaks in elite literary Spanish but the slaughter yard denizens (including the Judge) use the direct street Spanish of low class Buenos Aires. \\"The Slaughter Yard\\" is the first work to record this argot. It may be fruitfully compared with the vernacular Spanish of the city that is in use today, long after the massive Italo-Hispanic immigrations of the early twentieth century.The difference is surprisingly small. The text appears to be the first to record the typical Argentine interjection \\"che\\". Readings and symbolism In its immediate or obvious meaning it is simply a story of biting political criticism: almost as obvious is the symbolism of the slaughter yard as a microcosm of Rosas' polity where, but for the hero and the one bull who does have cojones, all are easily controlled. However all sorts of interpretations or symbolic meanings have been sought: Freudian,Sorbille, 2007, 23.Sorbille, 2009, 94. as a necessary ritual sacrifice,Bauz√°, 191. as an item in \\"Argentina's necrophilic catalogue\\",Mart√≠nez, 75-6. as a racist attack on Rosas' Afro-Argentines,Shumway, 207. from a feminist perspective,Coromina, 15. (The woman scavengers must be represented as old, ugly birds of prey and harpies because the slaughter yard is not a \\"domestic space\\".) and as Echeverr√≠a's (and indeed his political school's) crisis of masculinity.Haberly, 291.

Biography=Early life and education Butcher was born to Boman Rilea Butcher and Adeline Vail in Macomb, Illinois. Butcher attended The University of Kansas (KU), where he later graduated in 1894. Butcher began his career in education as a principal of a couple of high schools in Oklahoma, and in 1904, Butcher received his master of arts from Harvard University. Two years after graduating from Harvard, Butcher became Central State Normal School's sixth president in Edmond, Oklahoma, and served until 1908.President of Central State Oklahoma After resigning from Central State in 1908, Butcher left for Frederick William University in Germany.

KSN‚ÄìKansas State Teachers College presidency In 1914, Butcher started a work study program, which would give students on-campus jobs to help them attend school. 1917 saw the completion of the administrative building, Plumb Hall. Albert Taylor Hall, named after the fifth president of KSN, Albert R. Taylor, is an auditorium located within the building. Under Butcher's administration, the Memorial Union was built in 1922, named to honor veterans of World War I. Butcher also helped the Normal School transition a name change; the new name would Kansas State Teachers College to focus on teaching. In 1938, a new stadium, later named Francis G.

His family lived in District Six, a largely Coloured community made up of descendants of former slaves, artisans and merchants, as well as many Cape Malays, descendants of South-East Asians brought to South Africa by the Dutch East India Company during its administration of the Cape Colony. Like the vast majority of Cape Malays, Mosaval's family was Muslim. When Mosaval was a youth, he was noticed by Dulcie Howes, the doyenne of South African theatrical dance, while he was performing gymnastics. She invited him to attend the University of Cape Town Ballet School. Despite the disapproval of his Muslim parents and the white (\\"European\\") community, Mosaval accepted her invitation and began his dance training at the ballet school in 1947.Marina Grut, \\"Mosaval, Johaar,\\" in The History of Ballet in South Africa (Cape Town: Human & Rousseau, 1981), p. 396. He later explained, \\"It was the height of apartheid and there was no scope for me. She broke the race barrier by taking me to ballet classes. [...] I had to stand at the back of the class.

Apartheid prevented Mosaval from pursuing a dance career in his home country, but in 1950 he was noticed by visiting ballet celebrities Alicia Markova and Anton Dolin, after he was smuggled into Cape Town's Alhambra Theatre for an audition. They arranged for him to receive a scholarship to attend the Sadler's Wells Ballet School in London. Travel to London was paid with money gathered from friends and fundraising by the local Muslim Progressive Society. His parents never paid a cent towards his education in dance, either because they were too poor or because they never approved of it. \\"I had many obstacles in terms of my religion; my family was against me,\\" he told the Cape Times in 2018. \\"As the eldest of 10 children and being a male dancer, my decisions were frowned upon because they were unheard of.\\" Performing career Mosaval was recruited by Sadler's Wells Theatre Ballet in 1951. In 1956, Mosaval was promoted to soloist in the company, which was soon renamed the Royal Ballet. He became a principal dancer in 1960 and a senior principal in 1965. Mosaval toured extensively with the Royal Ballet, dancing in continental Europe, Australia, New Zealand, the Middle East, the Far East, Canada, and the United States as partner to such famous ballerinas as Margot Fonteyn, Svetlana Beriosova, Elaine Fifield, Lynn Seymour, Merle Park, Doreen Wells and fellow South African Nadia Nerina in ballets choreographed by Frederick Ashton, Kenneth MacMillan, Ninette de Valois, and two South Africans, David Poole and John Cranko. Noted for his performances as Jasper the Pot Boy in Pineapple Poll and as Bootface in The Lady and the Fool, both choreographed by Cranko, Mosaval was also acclaimed as the Blue Boy in Les Patineurs and as Puck in The Dream, both choreographed by Ashton, as well as the Blue Bird in The Sleeping Beauty. He developed a global reputation as a brilliant character dancer with impeccable technique. One Scottish critic wrote about his performance as Puck in 1967: \\"Puck seems tailor-made for Johaar Mosaval. His apparent ability to pause in the middle of a stupendous scene makes one think of the similar claim made for Nijinsky.\\" Later life After twenty-five years with the Royal Ballet, Mosaval retired from performing and returned to Cape Town, settling there permanently in 1976. He did make a guest appearance with CAPAB Ballet in the title role of Michel Fokine's Petruskha, thus becoming the first black dancer to perform on the stage of the Nico Malan Opera House. He was also the first black South African to appear on local television. He opened his own ballet school in 1977 and was employed as the first black Inspector of Schools of Ballet under the Administration of Coloured Affairs.Grut, \\"Mosaval, Johaar,\\" in The History of Ballet in South Africa (1981), p. 396. When he discovered that he could share his expertise only with a certain segment of the population, he resigned this position. Subsequently, his school was shut down by apartheid powers when it was discovered to be multiracial. Following the principles of his mentor, Dulcie Howes, Mosaval wanted to share his knowledge and love of ballet with students of all races, so he continued to find ways to dance and to teach. Honors and awards In 1975, Mosaval was the first dancer to earn a Professional Dancer's Teaching Diploma at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. Then, receipt of a Winston Churchill Award allowed him to travel to New York to study modern dance at the Martha Graham School and jazz dance at the Ailey School. In 1977, Mosaval received a Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Medal for his services to ballet in the United Kingdom. Other awards came to him in recognition of his contributions to South African arts and culture. For his contribution to the performing arts, he was given the Western Cape Arts, Culture, and Heritage Award in 1999; for exemplary conduct, he received a Premier's Commendation Certificate in 2003; and for lifetime achievement, he was awarded the Cape Tercentenary Foundation's Molteno Gold Medal in 2005. For his contribution to the performing arts, and to uplifting young dancers through his teaching, the City of Cape Town then awarded Mosaval its Civic Honours. It had taken almost three decades of exile and personal, artistic triumph in faraway lands before he was allowed to dance in his own country for his own people.City of Cape Town, \\"Johaar Mosaval,\\" online biography, City of Cape Town website (2015). The Arts and Culture Trust bestowed on him a Lifetime Achievement award for Dance in 2016. Notes Institutionalised apartheid began long before the National Party won the 1948 parliamentary elections. After the establishment of the Union of South Africa in 1910, apartheid laws were on the statute books.

She is known for her play Mariela in the Desert. It was the winner of the National Latino Playwriting Award and a finalist for other prizes. Mariela in the Desert was debuted at the Goodman Theatre in Chicago. Zacar√≠as is the founder of the Young Playwrights' Theater located in Washington, D.C.  Early life  Zacar√≠as received her Bachelors in Arts from Stanford University in 1991 and then went on to pursue her Masters in Creative Writing at Boston University in 1995. Zacar√≠as comes from an artistic family from Mexico. Her grandfather, Miguel Zacar√≠as, was a movie director and writer during the Golden Age of Mexican cinema in the 1930s and 1940s. Zacar√≠as initially resisted pursuing an artistic career. She said: Career She was the first playwright-in- residence at the Arena Stage in Washington, DC. She has written several plays like The Book Club Play, Legacy of Light, Mariela in the Desert, The Sins of Sor Juana, The Sun Also Rises and adaptations of plays like How the Garcia Girls Lost Their Accents, Just Like Us and others. Theaters that have showcased her plays include the Kennedy Center, Arena Stage, Goodman Theatre, Round House Theatre, Denver Center for the Performing Arts, Alliance Theatre, Imagination Stage (Bethesda, Maryland), Oregon Shakespeare Festival, GALA Hispanic Theatre, Berkshire Theatre Festival, South Coast Repertory, La Jolla Playhouse, Cleveland Play House, San Jose Repertory Theatre,GEVA Theater, Horizon Theater, People's Light and Theatre, Walnut Street Theater, Arden Theater, Milagro Theater, Teatro Vista, and Aurora Theater. Zacar√≠as was invited by the White House Historical Association and the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts to write a family play about the White House. She included young people in the process and her script was converted into a book published by Scholastic. It included a foreword by First Lady Michelle Obama. The book was called Chasing George Washington and the musical premiered at The Kennedy Center for Performing Arts and proceeded to go on a National Tour. Zacar√≠as established and founded the Young Playwrights' Theater in 1995. She began by volunteering and teaching playwriting classes to children in DC classrooms, and they grew so popular that she turned it into a 501c3 nonprofit organization by 1997. She is also the founder of the Latino Theatre Commons. She has been inspired by works from Maria Ines Fornes, Caryl Churchill, Sarah Ruhl, Lisa Loomer, Lisa Kron and Julia Cho. Writing for young people is very important for Zacar√≠as. It is a rewarding experience for Zacar√≠as to write for young people. She says: \\"I love writing for young people. You can't find a more honest and challenging audience on the planet. My strongest playwriting lessons have come in trying to create stories that will resonate with young people‚Äîit is a rewarding, hilarious and heartbreaking endeavor to create plays in which kids really see themselves on stage.\\"  Awards The Sins of Sor Juana was the winner of the Charles MacArthur Award for outstanding new play at D.C.'s 2000 Helen Hayes Awards. This play has been widely produced, thus Zacar√≠as translated it for a Spanish-language production in April at D.C.'s GALA Hispanic Theatre.

He has been described as \\"the ma√Ætre of exaggeration\\" and \\"the king of TV shows\\". His film Ipolochagos Natassa kept the most commercially successful film record for almost three decades from 1970 to 1999. Life and career Foskolos was born in Athens on 26 November 1927. He studied Political Science at the University of Athens but did not graduate. From the age of 17, he started writing successful radio plays with both a historical and modern background. His radio series Police Stories were the most popular radio series for three years. In the 1960s, he worked as a theatre critic and also wrote plays for the theatre and radio. He wrote screenplays for over 70 Greek films, mostly working for Finos Film. He introduced spaghetti westerns to Greek cinema. His TV daily serial Lampsi was a huge success and ran for 14 seasons getting into the Guinness World Records in 1995. He gained another entry into the Guinness World Records for writing two daily TV series, Lampsi and Kalimera Zoi, for ten years. Lampsi was shown for 13 years from 1991 to 2005 with a total of 3457 episodes produced. In the 1970s, his TV serial Agnostos Polemos (Unknown War) broke the record of TV ratings with 92% of Greek households tuning in to the show.

Interview In a 1999 interview to the Vima newspaper, Foskolos said that he wonders if the political reality in Greece has surpassed even his own screenplays and said that he thinks that Greek society has \\"fallen into a vertical aquarium of corruption\\". He said than in one scene of his film Koinonia, Ora Miden (Society, Hour Zero) a corrupt politician offers millions to Nikos Kourkoulos, who was playing the role of the honest hero of the film, to buy his silence for a crime committed by his cohorts. The politician told the hero that the price they had to pay was selling their conscience for their livelihood.

Mutations in the gene SLC34A2 result in loss of a key sodium, phosphate co-transporter (called Npt2b), known to be expressed in distal alveolar type II cells, as well as in the mammary gland, and to a lesser extent in intestine, kidney, skin, prostate and testes. As the disease progresses, the lung fields become progressively more dense (white) on the chest xray, and low oxygen level, lung inflammation and fibrosis, elevated pressures in the lung blood vessels, and respiratory failure ensue, usually in middle age. The clinical course of PAM can be highly variable, with some patients remaining asymptomatic for decades, and others progressing more rapidly. There is no effective treatment, and the mechanisms of stone formation, inflammation and scarring are not known. Signs and symptoms Patients typically have no symptoms until the third or fourth decade of life. In most cases, the disease is discovered incidentally on routine chest Xray. The most common symptoms include the following: * dyspnea * dry cough * chest pain * sporadic hemoptysis * asthenia * pneumothoraces Genetics PAM is hereditary and another involved family member can be identified in 36% to 61% of cases. Impaired activity of the SLC34A2 gene is responsible for PAM. The SLC34A2 gene encodes a membrane protein that is expressed primarily in the apical portions of alveolar type II cells and is the most abundant phosphate carrier in the lungs. Pathogenesis Type II alveolar cells have many important functions in the lung, including the production of pulmonary surfactant, maintenance of fluid balance and composition in the airspace. Phospholipids that make up pulmonary surfactant are broken down by macrophages, releasing phosphate into the alveolar lining fluid. The loss of the Npt2b phosphate transported eliminates the ability of alveolar type II cells to pump phosphorus ions from the alveolar space back into the bloodstream, and leads to microlith formation. Epithelial deletion of Npt2b in mice results in an authentic mimic of the human condition, including accumulation of calcium phosphate microliths in the lung tissue and progressive diffuse radiographic opacities. The mouse model provides a useful platform for preclinical studies, including therapeutic trials of EDTA lavage and low phosphate diet/phosphate binders. Pathology PAM may be confined to certain areas or show diffuse distribution through the lungs. Lung biopsy and autopsy specimens demonstrate characteristic intra-alveolar lamellar microliths. Calcium deposits in the alveoli begin in the lower lobes and spread over a period of years throughout the lungs. Diagnosis PAM is usually diagnosed on the basis of a typical radiological pattern, namely a very fine, sand-like micronodulation of calcific density diffusely involving both lungs, with basal predominance. Many authors argue that this pattern precludes the need for a lung biopsy in most cases. After PAM is diagnosed in a given patient, family members should be screened by chest radiography, and parents should be counseled that future children are also at risk of developing the disease. Radiology Chest radiographs of patients with PAM usually reveal bilateral diffuse micronodular calcifications, producing a \\"sandstorm‚Äù appearance that first involves the inferior portions and then the middle and upper portions of the lungs. High-resolution computed tomography The most common findings on HRCT are diffuse hyperdense ground- glass attenuation and subpleural linear calcifications, often most predominant in the inferior and posterior portions of the lungs. Additionally, the medial aspects of the lungs appear to be more heavily involved than the lateral aspects. Ground-glass opacities, probably due to small calculi in the air space, are the most common finding in children and in patients with early- stage PAM. Magnetic resonance imaging On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the calcific lesions usually show hypointensity or a signal void on T1- and T2-weighted images. Pulmonary function studies Pulmonary function tests, arterial blood gases, ventilation perfusion relationships, and O2 diffusing capacity are normal in the initial stages of PAM. As the disease progresses, pulmonary function tests reveal typical features of a restrictive defect with reduced forced vital capacity (FVC) and elevated forced expiratory volume in FEV1/FVC. Treatment To date, no treatment has been proven to effectively reverse or prevent the progression of PAM. Lung transplantation is an option for end stage disease, but is typically only recommended as a last resort when quality of life is significantly impaired. Etidronate is a bisphosphonate and can reduce the formation of calcium hydroxyapatite crystals. It has led to clinical and radiological improvements in few cases. Epidemiology Since the disease was first described in 1918, over 500 case reports have appeared in the literature. PAM is associated with consanguinity. The incidence is higher in Turkey, Japan, India and Italy. The mean age at diagnosis is 35 years based on the cases reported in the literature.

In 1918 the British government requisitioned the ship as troop transport for World War I service in the Atlantic. After further passenger service the ship was briefly requisitioned again for World War II transport of troops in southwestern Pacific waters. The ship ended service as a passenger transport in 1959 in Nagasaki, Japan. She was refitted in 1949 to use oil rather than coal as a power source, and was at that time renamed SS Columbia. Between her refitting in 1949 and her end of service she plied routes between a number of cities, including Piraeus, Lisbon, New York, Montreal, Cherbourg, Southampton, and Bremen (among others). She was damaged in foggy weather in Quebec in 1957 and was scrapped two years later after sailing to Japan. Passenger Service Katoomba was launched 10 April 1913 by Harland & Wolff at Belfast departing under the owner's senior ship master, Captain Lionel Moodie Heddle, who had overseen construction and would remain in command of the ship for the next twenty-three years that included wartime service, on 10 July 1913. Coaling took place and 237 passengers for Australia boarded at Glasgow, Scotland for departure on 19 July with a brief anchorage off Plymouth, England before sailing for Australia with an 11 August coaling stop at Durban before a nonstop voyage to Fremantle during which, with all six boilers fired, Katoomba reached speeds of better than 17 knots. On the night of 24 August the ship took on coal at Fremantle and sailed the next afternoon for Melbourne where she entered Port Phillip Bay on 29 August for anchorage overnight before docking next morning. On 13 September Katoomba sailed for Sydney where an event was held 18 September in which invited guests and journalist could inspect the ship while being entertained by a new attraction for the interstate trade, the Katoomba Ladies Orchestra. On 20 September the ship sailed for Melbourne, Adelaide and Fremantle beginning regular service which would continue until interruption by requisition for military service in World War I. World War I service The British government requisitioned Katoomba in May 1918 to transport United States troops to Britain and made two trans Atlantic crossings before transfer to the Mediterranean. She was in Salonika on 11 November at the armistice and three days later left Constantinople transporting more than 2,000 troops of the Essex and Middlesex Regiments, and twenty-six of the surviving prisoners that had been taken at the siege of Kut. In six Black Sea trips, as the first British troopship to pass through the Dardanelles since the war's start, Katoomba landed 14,000 troops and returned with repatriated Turks. She went to Bombay in April 1919 and returned to Britain before returning to Australia in August. There she was refitted and returned to her owners. The Katoomba transported over 430 Methodists and the Queen of Tonga from Sydney to Fiji in October 1935. World War II service In 1941 Katoomba was briefly requisitioned for troop deployments transporting 1,496 troops leaving Brisbane for Rabaul on 15 March and then again with 687 troops from Sydney to Darwin before returning to commercial service. Katoomba was transporting troops to Rabaul escorted by when news of the attack on Pearl Harbor (8 December Australian date) and other Japanese attacks in the Pacific caused her to be held in Port Moresby. Plans to reinforce the garrison at Rabaul were abandoned, with the existing garrison sacrificed to delay Japanese advances, and Katoomba instead joined other ships in evacuating women and children from New Guinea, Papua, and Darwin. She was again requisitioned as a troopship in February 1942. Katoomba was one of two Australian transports, the other being , that were substituted for the to transport a U.S. Army fighter group's ground troops and equipment to India. The troops and crated P-40 pursuit aircraft had arrived in a convoy from San Francisco escorted by with Mariposa and the United States Army Transport that were intended to continue on to India; however, Mariposa was withdrawn and the Australian transports substituted. The Phoenix with Duntroon, Katoomba and Holbrook departed Melbourne 12 February as convoy MS.5 for Colombo, Ceylon by way of Fremantle. There the and with aircraft for Java joined and the convoy departed Fremantle on 22 February. The ill-fated Langley and the Sea Witch left the convoy to proceed independently to Java while the remaining ships continued under escort by Phoenix until that cruiser was relieved by on 28 February about 300 miles west of Cocos Island. The convoy arrived at Colombo on 5 March. Troops of the 2nd AIF en route from the Middle East to Australia, waiting to embark on the transport Katoomba at Bombay 25 March 1942. On the return voyage from India the ship transported Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF) troops being returned to Australia from the Middle east for operations in the south west Pacific. In 1945, commendations were announced for men that volunteered to fight a fire in August 1943 when a falling sling of ammunition caused an explosion aboard in Port Moresby. First mate J. S. Burns, Able Seamen J. P. Shearer, J. W. Thrussell, and J. F. Robertson went below to fight the resulting fire despite the hold being filled with ammunition. Later in March, the transport loaded 2nd AIF troops at Bombay being returned from the Middle East for the defense of Australia. The ship was caught up in Australian labor union actions when engine room firemen caused a three-week delay in the ship's sailing from Brisbane to return troops from Bougainville. There were reports that angry troops threatened to toss the firemen overboard when the ship did arrive. As SS Columbia After being returned to her owners in 1946, Katoomba was sold to Goulandris Bros in Greece in July and renamed SS Columbia in 1949. She was retired from service in June 1950, laid up at Piraeus in March 1958 and scrapped at Nagasaki in 1959. References  Further reading * External links S.S.

(1996). Radio Stars: An Illustrated Biographical Dictionary of 953 Performers, 1920 through 1960. McFarland & Company, Inc. . Pp. 32-33. Early years Bestor was born September 13, 1889, in Longford, South Dakota (although his birthplace also has been cited as Madison, Wisconsin). His mother was Mrs. Carrie Bestor. His brother, A.L. Bestor, was also a musician, directing the orchestra of the Orpheum Theater in Madison. Critical evaluations Jazz writer George T. Simon wrote that Bestor \\"led one of the best bands of the twenties, the Benson Orchestra of Chicago. Its music was rhythmic, crisp and clean.\\"Simon, George T. (1974). The Big Bands. Collier Books. P. 496. In September 1925, the trade publication Variety reported that the Don Bestor name appeared \\"by itself on the Victor label, [an arrangement which] gives Bestor solo billing, and deservedly so.\\" In 1926 Bestor recorded 'I've Got The Girl' with a refrain by a group of male vocalists. One member of that vocal group, in his very first recording, was Bing Crosby. (It was over a year before Crosby recorded his first solo with Paul Whiteman). A 1942 review on the trade publication Billboard said about Bestor's band at that time, \\"There's nothing fancy or flashy about this combination; it's just a sound, well-balanced band that offers a good brand of music and looks wholesome and pleasing on the stand.\\" By 1949, a list of bands in Billboard designated Bestor's group as \\"inactive.\\" Radio=1920s Bestor's radio debut occurred in 1922 on KDKA in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. His orchestra, which was playing at the William Penn Hotel, was broadcast over the station in what was described in his obituary as \\"the world's first remote control orchestra pickup.\\" He also led orchestras at WLW in Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1925 and at WGN in Chicago, Illinois, in 1925-26.Sies, Luther F. (2014). Encyclopedia of American Radio, 1920-1960, 2nd Edition, Volume 1. McFarland & Company, Inc. . P. 69. By 1928, he and his orchestra were back on KDKA. 1930s Bestor's tenure at KDKA ended in 1931. A June 13 newspaper listing had the headline \\"Don Bestor to Say Farewell: Final Concert to Be Played Over KDKA Sunday at 7:15 P.M.\\" In 1932, Bestor and his orchestra were in New York City and \\"on the air over an NBC- WEAF hook-up four nights a week.\\" In the summer of 1933, the group was broadcast \\"from the 'Show Boat' on Lake George via remote control\\" over WGY in Schenectady, New York. Bestor's orchestra also provided the music for the Nestle Chocolateers program in 1933. On April 6, 1934, Bestor became the bandleader for Jack Benny's radio program, The General Tire Show. A statement from the sponsor said, in part, \\"Good music is an important part of a program such as Jack Benny presents, and critics who have commented on the excellence of the Benny broadcasts give no small part of the credit for their results to the tenor voice of Frank Parker and the intriguing melodies of Don Bestor and his musicians.\\" When Johnny Green replaced Bestor on the Benny program, a newspaper article noted: \\"Benny turned Bestor overnight from just another orchestra leader to the one man in America everyone knew wore spats... Bestor just finished a tour of the country on which he billed himself as the band that played with radio's king pin [sic] of humor.\\" Also in 1935, Bestor ran afoul of the musicians' union \\"because of paying his men under the scale while on the Jack Benny program,\\" but he was reinstated in December. Bestor had programs on CBS in 1936, on WLW in 1937, and on the Mutual Broadcasting System in 1939. 1940s On December 14, 1942, Bestor became the leader of the studio orchestra at WHN in New York City. His programs at that station included Gloom Dodgers. 1950s In 1954-55, Bestor and his wife had a disk jockey show on WICC (AM) in Bridgeport, Connecticut. Compositions Bestor's musical compositions, described as \\"catchy but fleetingly popular,\\" included Doodle-De-Doo, Just Baby and Me, Contented, Teach Me to Smile, and Down by the Vinegar Works. Probably the best known of his compositions was the J-E-L-L-O jingle for the Jell-O brand of gelatin dessert. In 1942, Bestor sued Benny, General Foods, NBC, and the Young & Rubicam advertising agency alleging that they \\"converted [his jingle] to their own use without his consent.\\" Bestor also wrote the song that was the theme of the Carnation Milk program. Personal life Bestor married Frankie Classen (or Klassen or Klossam), a dancer who was a \\"favorite of Chicago night club audiences.\\" They had a daughter, Mary Ann. Bestor later married \\"a jet-set covergirl model,\\" and they had a son, Don Bestor Jr., and a daughter, Robyn. He was also married to Hattie C. Bestor Catton. In 1937, a judge in Illinois ordered Bestor to surrender \\"insurance policies with a cash value of $3,000\\" to her \\"for back support of their 16 year old son, Bartley Bestor.\\" Mary Ann became an actress and at age 16 \\"signed for [the] No. 2 company of 'Eve of St. Mark'\\" in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1942. Death Bestor died of a cerebral hemorrhage January 13, 1970, in Metamora, Illinois. He was 80.

She currently lives in Springfield, Massachusetts where she is the artistic director of Teatro V!da, the first Latin@ theatre in Springfield, MA. Teatro V!da focuses on promoting youth leadership through the performing arts. G√≥mez is known for her multilingual works and dedication to creating art that can be understood by all, even those who are not multilingual. G√≥mez has worked with young people through the arts for nearly 40 years and focuses much of her work on intergenerational collaboration.  Early life  Magdalena G√≥mez was born in New York City to a Spanish Gitano father and a Puerto Rican mother. G√≥mez's parents were not formally educated. Her father had only completed school to a second-grade level, but was fluent in three languages and proficient in five languages total, Spanish, English, Basque, Italian, and Portuguese. Gomez's father immigrated to the United States through Ellis Island at the age of 17. Despite her parents' lack of formal education, G√≥mez displayed academic and intellectual ability from an early age. As a young girl, G√≥mez discovered the works of Ralph Waldo Emerson at her local library and has been interested in poetry and writing since then. G√≥mez cites her interest in writing and academics as something she discovered independently, as her schools were \\"more like prisons than centers of learning.\\"G√≥mez first publicly performed her poetry at a burlesque house in Greenwich Village at age 17.  Teatro V!da  Magdalena G√≥mez co-founded Teatro V!da, which was the first Latin@ theatre in Springfield, MA. The theatre was founded in 2007. Teatro V!da uses many modes of communication and production to reach over 250,000 audience members in the years since it began. The theatre holds an open-mic program called Ign!te the M!c, which is a venue run by youth and for youth. The theatre is in the process of creating a production that combines live music and dancing with poetry in partnership with the Ferocious Women's Group, another program started by Magdalena G√≥mez. Teatro V!da uses the phrase \\"the other TV\\" to describe the theatre, reflecting the idea that through theatre, members can create their own reality, apart from what is portrayed by popular media. Youth development and youth leadership are central to the theatre's mission, with their mission statement reading, \\"We encourage youth to strive for excellence in all facets of their lives with a spirit of generosity, non-violence and compassion.\\" Through Teatro V!da, youth can build relationships with adult professionals for guidance in developing their own artistic pursuits and passions. Most of Teatro V!da's productions and events are generated directly by youth and incorporate multi-media production concepts.  Professional works and accomplishments  Dancing in My Cockroach Killers (2013) is performing arts piece consisting of a collection of G√≥mez's poems and monologues set to music by composer Desmar Guevara. Bullying: Replies, Rebuttals, Confessions, and Catharsis (2012) is a book co-edited by G√≥mez that incorporates real stories from educators and students about their experiences with bullying. The collection of writings seeks to act as a method of healing for those impacted by bullying through the cathartic power of writing. The idea for the book resulted from the suicide of an 11-year-old boy who was the victim of bullying in Springfield, MA. Shameless Woman (2014) is a memoir in poems written by G√≥mez. The poetry included in the book was composed over several decades, from the 1970s to the time the book was published. The book is divided into six sections, Shameless Woman, Family, To the Essence, The Invention of War, Lessons from the Dream World, and Endangered Species. Language of Stars is a play written by G√≥mez starring a homeless man as the protagonist. The play won a Met-Life award from Repertorio Espa√±ol in New York City. G√≥mez is the founder of the Ferocious Women's Group, a group dedicated to promoting the voices of girls and women through writing and performing arts. The multi-generational Ferocious Women's Group meets regularly to support and empower each other, produce theatre, and mentor young women and girls. G√≥mez is also known for her work as a jazz poet. She traveled and performed with her performance partner, jazz saxophonist Fred Ho for ten years.  Current projects  Today, G√≥mez works as the artistic director of Teatro V!da. Additionally, she is a commentator for the New England Public Radio and a columnist for the Point of View newspaper.

The institute in Dalat was one of the many Pasteur Institutes established outside France. History=French period The buildings were designed by the French architect and a Vietnamese colleague. The Institute was established and first headed by Alexandre Yersin in 1936. At that time, the Institute manufactured vaccines against different strains of smallpox and rinderpest. The Institute in Dalat was one of four established by Yersin in Vietnam; the others being in Hanoi, Saigon and Nha Trang. In a report to the Grand Council of Economic and Financial Interests and to the Governing Council in 1937, the Institute reported producing over 3 000 000 vaccines, the majority of which were anti- cholera. Also produced were anti-plague, anti-typhoid, anti-staphylococcal, anti-gonococcal, anti-colibacillairy, anti-streptococcal and anti- meningococcal vaccines, along with tetra-vaccines and various Besredka filtrates. The Institute also kept a reserve of 1 000 000 cc of anti-cholera vaccine to be used in the event of a cholera epidemic. The Institute offered medical laboratory services, including microbiological examinations, pathological examinations and biological chemistry for the local populations of Dalat and the Upper Donnai regions. Their laboratories performed 1838 medical exams that year, helping to identify cases of dysentery, diphtheria, leprosy, malaria, typhoid fever and typhus. The Institute studied endemic diphtheria among the Europeans and Annamites of the Dalat region. It was also responsible for monitoring water purification for the city of Dalat. A report published in a French magazine in September 1952 showed the Institute was still producing vaccines against contagious human diseases, such as cholera, typhoid fever, gonorrhea, cerebrospinal meningitis, colibacillosis and pneumonia. They studied human epidemiology and microbiology, biological chemistry and the monitoring of drinking water. A new strain of Penicillium was isolated from hepatic lesions on a bamboo rat used for experimental infections at the Institute in 1956. Penicillium marneffei was named for Hubert Marneffei, Director of the Pasteur Institute of Vietnam. The institute was still publishing articles in French as late as 1959. French doctors ran the Institute until the 1960s. One of the last before the Communist victory, Jean Louis Colbert, worked at the Institute in Dalat from 1962 to 1968. He was responsible for the large scale production of vaccines for human use. Vietnamese period The Dalat facility was taken over by the Vietnamese government in 1975. Even before the take-over, the Institute had one of the largest vaccine production facilities in Southeast Asia, shipping vaccines all over in Indochina. The institute was then run by the Ministry of Health until the south of Vietnam was fully integrated into the country in 1978, using the Institute for public health and disease prevention. In 2010, the Dalat Pasteur facility was incorporated as the Dalat Pasteur Vaccines Company Limited (DAVAC). \\"The company's primary mission is the production and sales of vaccines and biological products, relations with international organizations, institutes, companies at home and abroad in the fields of business, technology transfer and support, scientific research and staff training\\". While now run by the Vietnamese government, the institute (along with the other Pasteur Institutes in Vietnam), seeks to establish a cooperation with the Institut Pasteur in France. One such declaration was issued in November 2010 at a conference in Haiphong, mentioning a cooperation that dates back 20 years. Discoveries and production Working with scientists at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, scientists in Dalat discovered a new type of salmonella in 1956. The strain was called S. dalat (also and more commonly known as Salmonella ball) and was isolated from fecal matter from a gecko captured in Phanrong. The Dalat facility has experience in producing typhoid vaccines. The facility was capable of producing 10 000 doses annually for this purpose, but production was discontinued due a lack of funding, an unsatisfactory vaccine production process and a lack of qualified staff. Since the start of production on the typhoid vaccine in 2008, the facility was not under full operation; producing only 0.3 million doses as of 2010.
