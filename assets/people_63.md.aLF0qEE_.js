Background  With the rise of online ordering platforms, many Minjiang University students turned to takeout food options to avoid ongoing food safety concerns associated with the university's often-crowded dining hall and canteens. Subsequent business loss led to objections being raised by traditional eating establishments. Around this time, several universities including USTB (University of Science and Technology Beijing), BIT (Beijing Institute of Technology) and Guangxi University of Foreign Languages implemented regulations to prohibit or restrict deliveries by takeout providers. Minjiang University planned to follow suit. Early in November 2018, rumors circulated claiming the university was to ban take-out food. Then, on November 11, Minjiang University issued a new regulation banning take-out food from entering the campus. This was confirmed in the morning via the release of the \\"instructions on the special work of campus renovation\\" on the official blog of the Student Work Office. The new regulation prohibited the consumption of take-out food on campus and threatened disciplinary action against students caught with take-out food on campus.  Protests  At noon on November 12, the university's dining hall saw an abnormally large crowd, with the second canteen filled to near capacity. Students, unable to get seats, were forced to wait in line at the gate. Noting the situation, several nearby take-out vendors turned up at the entrance of the Second Canteen and began offering free lunches. They also called on students to boycott the new take-out ban. In response, the university sent personnel to enforce order by asking the vendors to leave the premises. When the vendors refused to leave, the university referred the matter to the police, who arrived to remove the vendors. Later in the day, students posted an online critique of Mr. He Daiqin (the Party Secretary of Minjiang University), accusing him of instigating the ban on take-out food. They called for Mr. He to resign and demanded he be investigated by authorities. Some dormitory areas were in turmoil, with many students shouting from buildings in protest of the school's take-out ban.  Aftermath  On November 12, the school responded to the situation by allowing vendors to set up take-away food areas outside school gates. On the afternoon of November 13, university officials rejected students' charges against Mr. He Daiqin, and declined to investigate these allegations. The university subsequently relaxed the ban on take-away food on campus, calming protests and enabling take-away vendors to deliver food on campus. On the evening of November 14, Fuzhou police reported that four take-out food vendors who had distributed free lunches at the entrance to the Second Canteen of Minjiang University were placed in administrative detention for seriously disturbing the normal order of the school. On November 15, the university continued to allow take-out food to enter parts of the campus, and tweeted that it would further facilitate student meals, yet dismissed the allegation that \\"He Daiqin, the university leader, owned shares in the canteen\\" as an internet rumor. Vendors were permitted to set up in the dormitory area and make arrangements for selling and delivering food. Later, they officially recognized take-away food areas in Districts 3 and 4. This official recognition was further extended to Districts 1 and 2 on the morning of November 16. At noon on November 13, Minjiang University At the request of Minjiang University officials, Sina Weibo officially removed some topics about the take-out ban and deleted some micro blogs that attacked the university and its leadership. This was done to suppress hot searches and limit potential damage to the university's image.  Media attention At noon on November 12, after nearby take-out stalls were removed by the police, many witnesses uploaded photos and video of the scene to the internet. They complained about the university and compared it to a \\"prison\\". News about Minjiang University's take-out food ban trended on the hot search list on Sina Weibo. Further reporting by Sina, Pear Video, People's Daily, CNR and other media also covered the role of take-out food in colleges. Television channels CCTV-2 and CCTV-12 both ran stories on \\"Minjiang University has banned take-out food and merchants have offered free lunches\\". After the take-away ban incident, university staff interviewed by the media offered clarification on the ban. They stated that the university's objection was not to the ordering of take-away meals, but rather to the influx of take- away delivery vehicles which caused excessive on-campus traffic. They indicated that students ordering take-away food should meet their deliveries at the designated areas at the school's gates.

Built in either 1907 or 1912 for merchant Pavel Kosterin, the building was occupied during the Russian Civil War by the White Army. Following the Bolshevik takeover, it was used by various government departments and institutions. Since 1997, it has housed the Bashkortostan office of the Federal Customs Service of Russia. History Pavel Kosterin is said to have arrived in Ufa from Samara in around 1890. In 1898, the City of Ufa leased him a store in a shopping arcade; he used it to trade various wares. In 1900, Kosterin and his business partner S. A. Chernikov leased, and started operating, a state-owned three-storey steam mill on . In 1902, they rented part of the pier for 12 years to build warehouses to store grain, timber, and the materials necessary to run the mill, and also to build facilities for trading grains and other products. Additionally, they obtained permission to have ships, steamers and barges berth at the quay, and installed a pipe to supply oil. Kosterin became one of the wealthiest people in the city and the province. He also married Yekaterina, one of Ufa's richest heiresses, and took on various official posts in government and commerce. Early in the 20th century, Kosterin bought two estates at the corner of Pushkinskaya Street and Aleksandrovskaya Street (now Karl Marx Street), demolished the wooden houses there, and replaced them with a luxurious three-storey stone mansion, costing him around 30 thousand rubles. The mansion was among the first of Ufa's houses to be equipped with central heating; its boiler room was in the basement. The architect of the mansion is not known, but according to one source it was obviously either Konstantin Guskov or A. A. Shcherbachyov. Some sources claim that it was completed in 1907; others assert that completion was in 1912. In the spring of 1919, during the Russian Civil War, the building became the military headquarters of Admiral Alexander Kolchak, the \\"Supreme Leader and Commander-in-Chief of All Russian Land and Sea Forces\\" (the White movement). From June 1919, following the capture of Ufa by the Red Army, the building housed the political department of the 25th Rifle Division, under the command of Vasily Chapayev. In the courtyard, the Bolsheviks executed hostages and ordinary Ufa citizens suspected of assisting the White forces. Later, the building was occupied by the military registration and enlistment office, the Ministry of Agriculture, and, from 1983, the Research Institute of Livestock. Since 1997, it has housed the Bashkortostan office of the Federal Customs Service of Russia. Architecture Kosterin's House is Ufa's most striking example of Russian Art Nouveau architecture. Due to its angular location, with front fa√ßades overlooking both Pushkina and Karl Marx Streets, the building is U-shaped, with two entrances. Although the building is attributed to Pushkina Street, the main entrance and the main fa√ßade overlook Karl Marx Street. At the corner of the two streets, an elliptical attic with a similarly shaped window is highlighted with a bright accent. The festive external appearance of the building is due to its Art Nouveau mouldings, intertwining decorations, elliptical attic and elegant bas-reliefs. The two front fa√ßades feature rich and original decor with pronounced manifestations of the Art Nouveau style: smooth curved lines repeated in window openings, balcony framings, and in the winding lines of the openwork ornament of balconies and friezes. Particularly expressive are the various forms and finishes of the attic, the platbands and the locks of window openings, plaster macaroons, niches with stucco decorations and other elements. The two entrances are decorated with vertical partitioning of the wall, complex parapets and large windows. Inside, on the ground floor, are luxurious halls interconnected with enfilade suites. The halls feature moulded stucco ceilings, heavy oak doors high, and cast-iron patterned staircases with chiseled notch boards. The staircases were produced by Gutman; one of them (the northern one) remains fully intact.

It was built from 1893 to 1893. It is also known as Formerly 22-30 Gloucester Street and part of 40 Gloucester Street development. The property is owned by Property NSW, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002.  History  In 1807, the date of Meehan's survey, this site lay to the west of gardens adjacent to the Hospital garden. It contained a well defined building alignment that represented the northern end of a long narrow block which commenced at Cribbs Lane (Cumberland Place). Prior to 1812, Stafford Lett occupied the house and land to the north of the site. In 1812 Lett sold this portion of the site to John Kinchela for ¬£35. Kinchela died intestate and in 1839 his sister, Mary McCarthy, claimed and was granted title by the Commissioners of the Court of Claims. The southern portion of the site was granted unopposed to William Foster, a shipwright of Cumberland Street, in 1835. Harper's survey of 1822 reveals a building outline on the site which appears to occupy part of both allotments. However, a sewerage survey of reveals two distinct adjoining buildings of similar size. In 1845, Council rate assessors noted a two-room stone building with shingled roof on the northern allotment and a building of similar description on the smaller southern allotment. Between 1849 and 1863, Council Assessors noted the owner, or landlord of the northern allotment as Thomas Douglas. Court of Claims records indicate that Mary McCarthy's sister's married surname was Douglas thus it is likely that the allotment remained within the family. From 1861 to 1882 George Lake Young, an upholsterer was the owner, and landlord, of the northern premises and George Walker, a waterman, the tenant. This format continued almost unbroken till 1871 when Mr. Young took up residence however, in 1868, Sands Directory records that Nos. 44-46 Gloucester Street was vacant. In 1882 it appears that this house was demolished and the land left vacant for some years. The southern allotment had various tenants, including Thomas Mort, a quarryman; Edward Hancock, a mariner; Vincent Mathews and Antoine Murray until 1879 when Daniel Brown, a fireman, took up residence and retained till when this property was demolished. In 1893 William Hitchcock purchased the land and constructed a three-storey rendered brick Victorian Italianate style terrace of five houses naming them \\"View Terrace\\" (Nos. 22-30). Leased to numerous people, No. 22 also contained a shop occupied first by a watchmaker, a draper and then a series of confectioners. View Terrace was continuously tenanted for residential use until 1980.SCRA, 1986: CS/14 In 1911-1912 Cumberland Street was realigned and in doing so broke through the Gloucester Street alignment at Argyle Street. As a result, No. 22-24 Gloucester Street were demolished and the road level was raised by . View Terrace, together with adjoining terraces Nos. 32‚Äì44, many of which had been vacant and in bad condition for a number of years, were recommended for redevelopment in the Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority's planning review finalised in 1984. The retention and conservation of the whole Gloucester Street fa√ßade was also recommended. A four level office development was carried out in 1985‚Äì86, incorporating the Gloucester Street fa√ßade, and is known as 40 Gloucester Street.SCRA, Annual Report, 1984:12-13SCRA, Annual Report, 1985: 12-13 & 16SCRA, Annual Report, 1986: 18-19 The northern side boundary wall of View Terrace was also retained in the development, and provides evidence that the terrace (Nos. 22-24) previously continued to the north.  Description  View Terrace is a restrained Victorian Italianate style terrace of two houses built in 1893 of stuccoed brick. It has keystones, mouldings and label stops to each depressed arch opening above the windows and doorways. Half fluted pilasters divide the fa√ßade and define the recessed first floor balustraded balcony. The roof line is dominated by an elaborate parapet, the centre of which has the name View Terrace and the date 1892. It is below the current street line, but has a large forecourt. The original line of Gloucester Street is indicated in the paving.National Trust, 1978 The forecourt extends to the north to an area overlooking Argyle Street shaded by a loquat tree, which was created with the building of the Argyle Bridge when Nos. 22-24 Gloucester Street were demolished. The terrace forms part of a row of 19th spec built and early 20th century welfare housing at 26-72 Gloucester Street.

The work was completed in mid-1986.  Heritage listing  As at 28 October 2008, View Terrace fa√ßades and site are of heritage significance for the State of NSW for their historical and scientific cultural values. The site and remnant structure are also of State heritage significance for their contribution to The Rocks area which is of State heritage significance in its own right. The site of View Terrace Fa√ßades has historical significance due to its continual occupation since 1822. The remnant fa√ßade fabric is aesthetically significant due to its unique configuration, fine detailing and landmark qualities, and its contribution to the streetscape as demonstrated by the surviving scale and form of the original building. The View Terrace fa√ßade is part of a row of terrace house fa√ßades along Gloucester Street at Nos. 26-72 (excluding Nos. 42‚Äì44, demolished in 1985) which remain basically unaltered in external appearance since their construction. As part of this row View Terrace fa√ßade demonstrates \\"a rare juxtaposed study of the English terrace house form and its evolution as translated in Australia\\", (as identified by the National Trust). The changes which View Terrace fa√ßade survived have the ability to demonstrate a significant part of the story of The Rocks over time, including the civic improvements by the Sydney Harbour Trust involving the realignment of Gloucester and Cumberland Streets, and the building of the Argyle Stairs and Bridge in 1911-1912 which resulted in the demolition of 22-24 Gloucester Street. In the 1980s, the site was redeveloped to create an office block, and the Government involvement resulted in the design that incorporated the northern and western fa√ßades of the View Terrace into the newly created structure. These changes demonstrate various attitudes to heritage conservation policy and practice in different periods, and demonstrate the impact of resident and community action on the Government policies for the retention of buildings in The Rocks. The View Terrace facades was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The remnant fa√ßade of the View Terrace, 26-30 Gloucester Street, provides important evidence of the street plan and layout before the major realignment in 1911. The floor levels of the former terrace, close to the Gloucester Street lower level, the steps to Cumberland Street and the footbridge from Cumberland Street pavement to the upper level of View Terrace at 98 Cumberland Street provide evidence of this change. The surviving fa√ßade fabric provides evidence of the design of terrace houses in Australia in the Victorian period. The fabric demonstrates the residential character of The Rocks of Victorian period. The original creation of View Terrace was part of the speculative housing developments, purposely built to generate rental income . The terrace was subjected to resumption by the Government in 1900, used as working class accommodation after that date and redeveloped in the 1980s. The surviving fa√ßade is an example of the 1980s \\"fa√ßade-ist\\" approach to the conservation practice. It is demonstrative of this, now abandoned, understanding of significance based merely on the presentation of an item to the general public. The item meets this criterion on State level. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The terrace was built and owned by William Hitchcock, who used it for the generation of rental income. It was resumed by the Government in 1900, rented to workers until the 1980s. The View Terrace had no known special association with any individuals notable in the history of The Rocks or NSW. The item does not meet this criterion. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The surviving fa√ßade presents with a high degree of architectural integrity and its period detailing is fully compatible with the surviving Victorian imagery of much of the Gloucester Street. While the building is now used as offices, the appearance of the fa√ßade maintains a reference to past residential use, and strongly contributes to the aesthetic character of the streetscape. The building has strong visual relationships with adjacent buildings, including the terraces at 32-36 and 38-40 Gloucester Street, which enhance the presentation of its aesthetic character. The item meets this criterion on Local level. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Gloucester Street Terraces' fa√ßades were preserved as a consequence of the activities of the Green Bans movement. Since the resumption of the area by the Government, the original terraces were occupied by the working class renters and associated with series of activities of the Government aiming to improve social condition of the residents, e.g. fixed rents established by the Fair Rents Act which made long term renting affordable, and allowed many tenants to stay at the same residence for years. These associations however are generally applicable to most historic residences in the area. The item does not meet this criterion. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. It is considered that any such potential of the original structure was lost due to the extensive excavations and demolition of the houses behind the fa√ßade line , however, the fa√ßade was identified by the National Trust to be of potential interest for further research of evolution of terrace houses' fa√ßade forms in NSW. The item meets this criterion on State level. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The surviving fa√ßades are remnant of an item built to a unique design, albeit within the characteristic architectural style of its date of creation. The item meets this criterion on Local level. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The surviving fa√ßades are representative of the architectural style of the terraces, and this design was noted in the studies of the National Trust on development of the terrace houses in Australia.

Education  In 1893, he graduated with a bachelor's degree in agriculture from Kansas State University, and was largely self-trained in a variety of other fields, such as archaeology and journalism. In 1896, he moved to Oklahoma City. He did scholarship on the history of Oklahoma, joined the History faculty at the University of Oklahoma, served for 38 years, and was inducted into the Oklahoma Hall of Fame. Early life Thoburn was born in Bellaire, Ohio, the son of Thomas C. and Mary Eleanor (nee Crozier) Thoburn. Thomas and Mary were both natives of Pennsylvania, and had lived near Pittsburgh. Thomas was a farmer and a Civil War veteran, who had been captured by the Confederate army, and spent several months in a prison camp before being paroled to return home. Thomas and Mary were married on September 26, 1865, a few days after Thomas was mustered out of the Union Army.Lambert, Paul Frank. Pioneer Historian: The Life of Joseph B. Thoburn. 1975 Accessed February 4, 2019.] The family moved to Marion County, Kansas in 1871, where Joseph grew up and graduated from the Agricultural College in Manhattan in 1893, with a bachelor's degree in Agriculture. In 1894, he married Caroline Conwell, who had been teaching at an academy in the Choctaw Nation, which was then in Indian Territory. Move to Oklahoma The Thoburns moved to Oklahoma City in 1896. Joseph initially worked as a printer and journalist to develop and promote the commercial and educational aspects of Oklahoma City. He performed short-term jobs such as editing The Farm Journal. By May, 1902, he had joined the Oklahoma City Commercial Club and had been named as its Secretary. He was active in organizing the Oklahoma City Chamber of Commerce, which became the successor to the Commercial Club. This brought him into the circle of Anton Classen and other Methodist civic leaders who were trying to establish Epworth University in Oklahoma City. Thoburn was appointed secretary of the Oklahoma Territorial Board of Agriculture (OTBA) in 1903, because of his interests in promoting water conservation and reclaiming land. His salary was fixed at $1000 per year, He remained in this job for two years. On July 5, 1904, Thoburn was unanimously re-elected as the head of the Board of Agriculture for the coming year. Unexpectedly, he was unable to attend an executive session on the next day. The board limited his annual budget to $20 per month to cover the cost of buying a typewriter and hiring steographic help to handle the Department's business. It was later found that a faction of the board had been influenced by the Continental Creamery Company and a friend of that organization in the Oklahoma Senate had instituted this ploy to punish Thoburn for opposing their attempt to create a monopoly in the state creamery industry. The action stood despite opposition from many other powerful interests in the state, especially newspapers and politicians who recognized political skulduggery when they saw it. The president of the board responded to the protests by claiming that Thoburn was too inexperienced to handle the growing workload and needed to be replaced, effective immediately. The deed was done.Lankford, pp. 29-32 After his ouster from the OTBA, Thoburn accepted an offer to become managing editor of the Farmer's Magazine, where he could still employ his agricultural knowledge and his publication schools. He soon found that this job was insufficient challenge for his interests, so he left to become involved in the campaign to gain statehood by uniting the interests of both the Indian and Oklahoma Territories. In February 1907, he became associated with the Jamestown Exposition Company and became responsible for the work needed to present the two territories' exhibits at a major fair that would be held in St. Louis. It was the kind of promotional worked he had always loved to do. The hardest part seemed to be raising funds. An associate of Thoburn's reportedly said about his experience in Muskogee, \\"...\\"jarring them loose from their coin is like pulling teeth without cocaine.\\"Lankford, p. 40 Thoburn wrote a small book titled Oklahoma: Its Resources and Attractions and the Activities and Achievements of its People to promote the exposition. He served as Secretary of Oklahoma's Territorial Board of Agriculture for two years and was Director of the Oklahoma Historical Society for 38 years. He was inducted into the Oklahoma Hall of Fame in 1932. His work included research on indigenous peoples and early settlers. He wrote a history of schools in Oklahoma in 1908. In 1908, Thoburn then began researching and writing his first notable book about Oklahoma history, The History of Oklahoma (1908), the first Oklahoma history textbook in the state.Oklahoma County HCE Genealogy Group, pages 94-95 Thoburn met Muriel Hazel Wright in 1914 while he was a board member of the Oklahoma Historical Society. He helped shape her passion for Choctaw and Native American history and they collaborated on the four- volume Oklahoma: A History of the State and its People published in 1929. She also authored three textbooks about the state's history which were used in public schools: The Story of Oklahoma, Our Oklahoma and The Oklahoma History.Laughlin, Patricia. \\"Wright, Muriel Hazel.\\" Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture.

After the First World War, the Greek state had planned the ambitious construction of several new rail lines and links, including a standard gauge line from Kalambaka on to Kozani and then Veroia creating a conversion of the route from Volos to Kalambaka on standard gauge. In 1927, the relevant decisions were made, starting in 1928, work was carried out on the construction of the new line from Kalambaka. But a year later, it was clear that the project would exceed the estimated costs many times over. In 1932, the construction work was stopped and remains unfinished.Alexandros C.

Karnovs Lovssamling (Karnov's Law Collection, often referred as Karnov) is a compilation that contains all significant laws of Denmark. The laws are commented on with interpretations, rulings, administrative decisions and references to literature. In addition, the compilation is updated following legislative changes, so the work the current laws with changes in a single version. History Karnovs Lovssamling was first produced in 1924,Michael Bogdan, Swedish Law in the New Millennium (2000), p. 51. under the title Hvermands Lovbog (Everybody's Laws), by district court prosecutor Magnus Karnov (1882-1962), from S√∏nderborg. It contained the most common Danish laws, and the motive for the release was the Southern Jutland reunion with Denmark. While the country had been under German rule, German law had been applied, but after the reunification, Danish law was introduced gradually. The lack of a comprehensive law such as the German B√ºrgerliches Gesetzbuch inspired Karnov to create his own collection. Commentary was added later, and the concept was also expanded to Norway and Sweden. Although the book edition in the characteristic pale yellow color with the inscription \\"KARNOV\\" on the back is the classic symbol of a lawyer, it is currently overtaken by the online edition, which is updated on a regular basis. The physical law collection is published today in a smaller edition and is a digest of 4-5 volumes. The law collection is published annually and updated ten times annually, with lesser books (Karnov's Yellow Booklets). , Karnov is published by Karnov Group (formerly Thomson Reuters Professional). Construction The law collection is organized in 23 different subjects, such as state and administrative law, health laws or finance. Each topic is again divided into subtopics. In addition to the purely systematic structure, Karnov is also equipped with a number of registers or indexes, to enable relevant provisions to be found in several ways. The online version has different search and storage options and integration with other electronic products from the same publishing house - especially the Ugeskrift for Retsv√¶sen. There are also a number of additional modules for Karnov providing the ability to find the laws, histories and old legislative versions, announcements, circulars and guides. The law has been commented using a very comprehensive notary. Each law begins with the law's history and relevant sources. Each provision of the law is provided with notes as needed. Some provisions are not commented at all, some have a single note and some provisions have note references for almost every word. The notes contain comments on the provision or the part of the provision to which it refers. The comments consist partly of actual interpretations or interpretations, partly by references to and summaries of judgments and other practices, and partly by references to other rules and in-depth literature. The notes are far more extensive than the statutes themselves. Smaller special versions have also been made for special subjects, the largest special edition of which is EU Karnov. In addition, there are also Property Karnov, Company Karnov and Health Karnov, where the relevant laws are selected and collected (with comments) in a single volume. The academic content is handled by an editorial staff. , the editorial board was composed of Doctor of Jurisprudence Bo von Eyben of the University of Copenhagen, Dr. Jan Pedersen of Aarhus University, and Supreme Court Judge Thomas R√∏rdam. In addition, there is a broader editorial and a wide range of specialist specialists who write and edit the content in the comment section. Over time, some of the country's top lawyers have been in the main editorial staff. Literature * Axel Andersen, Danish reference books, Chapters 10-18, Gad, 1977.

The floor or platform is projected beyond the walls creating a continuous narrow ledge on the exterior of the building. Sri Lankan houses and other buildings that featured a courtyard could also have an inner pila. The pila was built up from stone and earth brick which was smoothly plastered and finished with cow dung, creating a hygienic, hard and impervious surface. The houses of higher status people would have an increased number of rooms connecting the internal pila.

For people of lower status kolombu ketes, low wooden seats, would occasionally be brought out for their use. In later times, due to Hindu influence, visitors of the same status as the owners, as dictated by caste, were invited into the courtyard of the house but were rarely invited to sleep there.

He was known for his association with Martin Luther King Jr., with whom he marched in Selma and on whose request he participated in a 1964 demonstration in St. Augustine, Florida, at which he was arrested and jailed together with 15 other Reform rabbis. He was for decades the rabbi of Temple Israel in Northern Westchester, New York. After his retirement, he served for seven years as a part-time rabbi at Congregation Shomrei Torah in Santa Rosa, California.  Early life and education  Michael Aaron Robinson was born on December 13, 1924, in Asheville, North Carolina. His parents were Samuel Robinson (1891‚Äì1973), an optometrist who had immigrated to the United States from Belarus, and Esther Kroman Robinson. Michael was one of seven children. His family was Reform and attended temple each Friday night. Growing up in Asheville, which had about 200 Jewish families in total, most of Michael's friends were not Jewish. His father treated many black patients and was known to not give priority to white patients when black patients had arrived first. As a result, some of his white patients turned to other doctors. At age ten, Michael began sitting in the back of a bus with his black nanny, and later wrote: \\"When I was ten years old I began sitting on the back seat of the bus with 'colored people'. I never returned to the front seat\\". He earned a B.A. at the University of Cincinnati. During World War II, while studying architecture at North Carolina State College, he interrupted his studies to join the US Navy. He worked in electronics maintenance on a landing ship tanker in the Pacific theater, and returned home with the desire to be a rabbi and a pacifist. He received rabbinic ordination from the Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati in 1952, becoming the first North Carolina native to be rabbinically ordained. During his rabbinical studies, he became involved with civil rights activism and organized a student effort to desegregate a local Greek restaurant.  Rabbinic career  Robinson began a rabbinical career with his wife Ruth, who was also a civil rights activist and often sang beside him as a cantorial soloist. After serving as rabbi in Temple De Hirsch in Seattle for three years, in 1955 he joined Temple Beth Israel of Pomona, serving for five years. He went on to serve as rabbi for 29 years at Temple Israel in Croton, New York, retiring as Rabbi Emeritus. In the latter congregation, he led drives to raise funds to rebuild black churches that had been burned during civil rights protests, and purchase the van which the Freedom Riders used in Mississippi. In the summer of 1964, he and other Reform rabbis who were attending the meeting of the Central Conference of American Rabbis answered the call of Martin Luther King Jr. to stand with him for civil rights in St. Augustine, Florida. They were among 70 demonstrators who converged on the Monson House on June 18 and were asked to leave by James Brock, the motel manager. Brock began pushing the demonstrators, who refused to budge; according to The New York Times, \\"First he pushed the leaders and one by one he pushed the rabbis. As one rabbi was pushed aside another would step forward to take his place\\". Police arrested the 16 rabbis, including Robinson, Hebrew Union College professor Eugene Borowitz, and Rabbi Allen Secher, along with 25 other protesters. The rabbinical delegation defended their action in a joint letter, Why We Went, which they composed in their jail cell. They were released in the morning after posting a bond; the charges against them were later dropped. In 1965, Robinson marched with King in Selma. Robinson was imprisoned a second time, with others, for a protest at Livermore, California, against the development of nuclear armaments at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. He retired to Santa Rosa, California, with his wife, to be closer to their daughter Jude. In 1989, he became a part-time rabbi at Congregation Shomrei Torah in Santa Rosa, where the congregation grew from 30 to 100 families during his seven-year tenure. He retired in 1996 as Rabbi Emeritus of Shomrei Torah as well. Other activities In 1977, Robinson earned a Ph.D. from the Union Theological Seminary in New York City. Robinson served on the board of the Fellowship of Reconciliation, an interfaith peace organization, for decades. In 1996, he became a founding member of Angry White Guys for Affirmative Action. He was a proponent of same-sex marriage and was involved in protests against nuclear warfare and apartheid. He was active in the Sonoma County Task Force on Homelessness, Children's Village, the Living Wage Coalition, Habitat for Humanity, the Sonoma County Peace and Justice Center, and the Sonoma Land Trust. Personal life Robinson and his wife Ruth (nee Hertzman) had two daughters and a son. Robinson died on July 20, 2006, of cancer at his home in Sebastopol, California. Approximately 500 people attended his funeral. An annual Rabbi Michael Robinson Memorial Lecture is presented by Congregation Shomrei Torah.

It was built during 1885. It is also known as part of development known as 40 Gloucester Street. The property is owned by Property NSW, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002.  History  Meehan's survey of 1807 shows this area west of the gardens adjacent to the Hospital gardens. The first evidence of any structure on this site appears in 1857. A one-storey, four roomed, stone and shingled roofed house was owned and occupied by David Whitebrow. Some time after 1863 Whitebrow, a Master Mariner, and his wife moved in as tenants, eventually buying the property . This family remained the owners of the property till 1901 when the Government resumed ownership of the property. Percy Doves plan of 1880 shows a structural layout for this site that is similar to the 1857-65 plan. However, the Sydney City Plan of 1887 reveals additional changes to this site. These changes are reflected in the Council Assessment Books of 1882, which records the presence of a three-storey brick and slate roofed terrace which is divided into three units.SCRA 1986: CS/15 The terraces were leased till . In 1985-86 the facades of Nos. 26-40 Gloucester Street were retained as part of an office development known as No. 40 Gloucester Street. The work was completed in mid 1986. The original road level has been established and the line of the original kerb paved in sandstone. A flight of stairs has also been created leading from Gloucester Street to Cambridge Street on the southern side of No. 40 Gloucester Street in the tradition of lanes and stairs which are a feature of The Rocks. According to the Council Rate Assessment records in 1851 this site contained two, one storey stone and shingle roofed houses. Between 1867-1869 No. 38 was demolished and this site remained a vacant block till 1883. No. 40 was occupied by different people till the house was demolished . By 1884 Sands Sydney Directory records the presence of tenants at this site so it is reasonable to presume that a new residence has been constructed. The new structure being a three-storey, six room brick terrace with an iron roof, divided into two units. In the 1890s these premises were used as boarding houses by different tenants and were continually leased till the early 1980s. In 1985 the facade was retained and the pitched roof reinstated the remainder being demolished to become part of the office complex known as 40 Gloucester Street.

Heritage listing =32-36 Gloucester Street= As at 1 April 2011, the terrace fa√ßade at 32-36 Gloucester Street and its site are of State heritage significance for their historical and scientific cultural values. The site and remnant structure are also of State heritage significance for their contribution to The Rocks area which is of State heritage significance in its own right. The site of the terrace fa√ßade at 32-36 Gloucester Street has historical significance due to its continual occupation since the 1850s. It is aesthetically significant for its contribution to the streetscape as demonstrated by the surviving scale and form of the original building. The fa√ßade is part of a row of terrace house fa√ßades at 26-72 Gloucester Street (excluding Nos. 42-44, demolished in 1985), which remain basically unaltered in external appearance since their construction. As part of this row the fa√ßade at 32-36 Gloucester Street demonstrates \\"a rare juxtaposed study of the English terrace house form and its evolution as translated in Australia\\", (as identified by the National Trust). The changes which Terrace Fa√ßade survived have the ability to demonstrate a significant part of the story of The Rocks over time, including the civic improvements by the NSW Government, including the 1980s redevelopment of the site to create an office block, when the Government involvement resulted in the design that incorporated the Terrace Fa√ßade into the new structure. These changes demonstrate various attitudes to heritage conservation policy and practice in different periods, and demonstrate the impact of resident and community action on the Government policies for the retention of buildings in The Rocks. Terrace was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The remnant fa√ßade of the Terrace at 32-36 Gloucester Street provides evidence of the street levels before the major realignment in 1911, through the former terrace floor levels located on the Gloucester Street lower level. The surviving fa√ßade fabric provides evidence of the design of terrace houses in Australia in the Victorian period. The fabric demonstrates the residential character of The Rocks in Victorian period. The original creation of the terrace was part of the speculative housing developments, built to generate rental income s, and significantly modified with the same purpose s. The terrace was subjected to resumption by the Government in 1900, used as working class accommodation after that date and redeveloped in the 1980s. The surviving fa√ßade is an example of the 1980s \\"fa√ßade-ist\\" approach to the conservation practice. It is demonstrative of this, now abandoned, understanding of significance based merely on the presentation of an item to the general public. The item meets this criterion on State level. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The original terrace was a rental property, purchased and modified by Whybrow family in the 1880s, and owned by their relatives until the Government resumptions. The association with the Whybrows family is not considered to meet the threshold of this criterion. The item does not meet this criterion. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The surviving fa√ßade presents with a high degree of architectural integrity and period detailing fully compatible with the surviving Victorian imagery of much of the Gloucester Street. While the building is now used as offices, the appearance of the fa√ßade maintains a reference to past residential use, and strongly contributes to the aesthetic character of the streetscape. The building has strong visual relationships with adjacent buildings, including the terraces at 26-30 and 38-40 Gloucester Street, which enhance the presentation of its aesthetic character. The item meets this criterion on Local level. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Gloucester Street Terraces' fa√ßades were preserved as a consequence of the activities of the Green Bans movement. Since the resumption of the area by the Government, the original terraces were occupied by the working class renters and associated with series of activities of the Government aiming to improve social condition of the residents, e.g. fixed rents established by the Fair Rents Act which made long term renting affordable, and allowed many tenants to stay at the same residence for years. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. It is considered that any such potential of the original structure was lost due to the extensive excavations and demolition of the houses behind the fa√ßade line , however, the fa√ßade was identified by the National Trust to be of potential interest for further research of evolution of terrace houses' fa√ßade forms in NSW. The item meets this criterion on State level. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The surviving fa√ßades are remnant of an item built to a unique design, albeit within the characteristic architectural style of its date of creation. The item meets this criterion on Local level. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The surviving fa√ßade is representative of the architectural style of the terraces, and this design was noted in the studies of the National Trust on development of terrace houses in Australia. The item meets this criterion on State level. =38-40 Gloucester Street= As at 1 April 2011, the terrace fa√ßade at 38-40 Gloucester Street and its site are of State heritage significance for their historical and scientific cultural values.

The item meets this criterion on State level. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The surviving fa√ßades are remnant of an item built to a unique design, albeit within the characteristic architectural style of its date of creation. The item meets this criterion on Local level. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The surviving fa√ßade is representative of the architectural style of the terraces, and this design was noted in the studies of the National Trust on development of the terrace houses in Australia. The item meets this criterion on State level.

Premier owns many well-known South African food brands, including Blue Ribbon, Snowflake, Manhattan, and Lil-lets. The company also sells the Lil-lets brand in the United Kingdom and Ireland. The company exports food from South Africa to other markets, including Mozambique. History Premier has its roots in the 1964 merger of two iconic South African corporations - Premier Milling Company Ltd and South African Milling Company. South African Milling Company originated from Attwell's Bakery, founded in 1820, while Marks & Co., founded by Joffe Marks in 1890, registered under the name Premier Milling Company Ltd in 1913. The company expanded over the years, incorporating more bakeries, mills, and brands, and expanded into Cape Town in 1887. Close to 100 years later, in 1984, the company became Premier Food Industries Limited. In 2011, international investment group Brait S.E. became the strategic long-term shareholder in Premier Foods, increasing its shareholding from 49.9% of Premier to the current 90% shareholding. In 2012, Premier Foods entered Swaziland through the acquisition of a controlling stake in Mr. Bread and Swaziland United Bakeries, and in 2013, the company acquired Manhattan confectionery and Lil-lets (SA and UK).

After the First World War, the Greek state planned the ambitious construction of several new rail lines and links, including a standard gauge line from Kalambaka on to Kozani and then Veroia creating a conversion of the route from Volos to Kalambaka (though Karditsa) on standard gauge. In 1927, the relevant decisions were made, starting in 1928, work was carried out on the construction of the new line from Kalambaka. But a year later, it was clear that the project would exceed the estimated costs many times over. In 1932, the construction work was stopped and remains unfinished.Alexandros C.

It was built during 1914. It is also known as Edwardian Cottages. The property is partially privately owned, with the residue owned by Property NSW, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002.  History  The site now occupied by the Terraces was part of Section 76 of the Parish of St Philip and appears to have been granted and claimed by at least four parties during the 1830s. The northernmost portion, Allotment 4, was claimed by G. Gibbs (date unknown). The adjacent lot, Allotment 3 was granted William Long in June 1839. Allotment 2 was granted to Jane Farrell in May 1836 and Allotment 11, the southernmost portion, was granted to Mary Lupton in April 1839. Primary Applications relating to part of Allotments 2 and 3 shows that the sites were both conveyed in the 1860s and consolidated by William and John Smith, Customs House Agents, during the 1870s. The 1865 Trigonometrical Survey of Sydney indicates that part of this land had been developed by this time. A number of buildings are shown in the middle and northern sections of the site which also appears to be broken up into small allotments facing Cambridge Street. The southern portion is vacant. The four terraces, now known as Susannah Place are also shown, numbered Nos. 64‚Äì70. A plan of Lot 11, which also shows Lot 2 and part of Lot 3 dated 1863 notes that W. Smith was the owner and occupier of an L shaped structure on Lot 2. W. Smith is also noted as the owner of the adjacent property to the north, occupied by Burne. In the same year John Stone Lord purchased a rectangular shaped parcel of land, part of Lot 11, extending between Cambridge and Gloucester Sts, with just over 22 feet frontage to each. The parcel of land illustrated on the title, and southernmost section of the subject site, is occupied by a rectangular structure constructed to the party wall of what is now known as Susannah Place. A note on the drawing indicates that Mrs Riley owned/ occupied the site to the immediate south and W Smith the land to the immediate north. The title shows that this parcel was transferred again in 1876 and 1893. In May 1873, the northern part of Lot 11 was purchased by John Bros and George Wall, also Customs House Agents, from William Smith. The L shaped parcel featured just over 22 feet frontage to Cambridge St and just over 52 feet frontage to Gloucester St and wrapped around land and buildings owned by William Smith. This land was subsequently transferred to John Smith in 1890. The building outlines are also clear on the Percy H. Dove map of the area and highlights the fact that the earlier buildings on the site faced Cambridge St and the harbour. Two single storey structures are shown on the northern portion of the site. The structures are set back from the Cambridge St boundary with smaller structures and yard area behind in the western portion of the allotments, fronting Gloucester St. A two-storey structure is shown on the middle section of the site with shed, yard and what is assumed privy behind, extending to the Gloucester St boundary. A passage separates the building from an L shaped, single storey structure constructed to the Cambridge St boundary with yard extending to the Gloucester St frontage. The adjacent allotment also features a smaller structure abutting the L shaped between and open area noted as garden. The four terraces (Susannah Place) to the immediate south of the site are also shown, numbered Nos. 38‚Äì44. The southern allotment, adjacent to these terraces is now labelled vacant land. A Sydney Water survey plan dated 1887 amended in 1895 shows the land occupied by several substantial buildings, all appearing to face Cambridge St. The northern portion of the site is occupied by a large stone, L shaped structure with two small brick outbuildings, one constructed to the Cambridge St boundary line. A regular shaped stone building is also shown in the next allotment to the south, however, this has been struck out, possibly indicating that it had been demolished by the time the plan was amended in 1895. Another L shaped, brick and stone building noted as Tyrone Cottage occupies the adjacent lot. The building which was present on the earlier plans clearly faces Cambridge St with open land around. The southernmost portion of the site, adjacent to Susannah Place, is shown vacant at this time. The plan also indicates that the street numbering altered to the present numbers, in the period between 1887 and 1895. The various parcels of land that make up the subject site continued to be transferred and sold. Purchasers predominantly worked in the area. In December 1896 John Smith and James Augustus Adrian, both Customs House Agents, acquired part of Allotment 3. At the same time, John Smith also acquired part of Allotment 2. In July 1897 Smith also purchased part of Allotment 2 with over 29 feet frontage to Cambridge St. In the same year Smith and Adrian consolidated all of Allotment 3 granted to William Long on 22 June 1839 and part of Allotment 2 originally granted to Jane Farrell in May 1836. The site featured just over 19 feet frontage to Gloucester St and nearly 29 feet frontage to Cambridge St. In 1901 the entire site was resumed and vested with the Minister for Public Works. The cleansing operations in the area included the photographing and recording of buildings to be demolished. A set of photographs, dated 1901 show buildings occupying the site at this time, including Tyrone Cottage. A photograph looking south west along Cambridge St shows the building that occupied the northern section of the site at this time. Elevated high above Cambridge St, it was a simple, gable roofed structure. The small brick building constructed on the street alignment is also visible. Tyrone Cottage is also visible with its steeply pitched gable roof and dormers on the east facing roof slope. Another photograph also dated 1901 looking north along Gloucester St, shows the building occupying the north western section of the site at this time. It is clear that the early buildings on the site faced Cambridge St and possibly the Harbour and not Gloucester St. The buildings to the north of the site further along Gloucester St and the early street level are also visible. It would appear that demolition of the buildings followed, probably overseen by the Government Architect's Branch. All buildings constructed before the introduction of building regulations requiring fire separation in 1838, were demolished in the Gloucester St area. Substantial buildings such as Susannah Place (1844) which were constructed with party walls were retained. The 1908 plan of proposed workers housing projects includes the subject site on the eastern side of Gloucester St. The site continued to feature frontage to Cambridge St, by this time reduced to a 12 feet wide footway. Possibly in preparation of the proposed works, the level of Gloucester St around the site and Susannah Place was raised. The pavement and road were at a similar level until c. 1910, from which time Cumberland and Gloucester Sts were realigned. No early plans of the building or site could be located, however, the Sands Directory indicates that the last of the earlier buildings occupying the site was demolished around 1902 and current buildings constructed between 1902 and 1911. In 1902 a Mrs Bridget Tate is listed in the Sands Directory occupying No. 46 Gloucester St. In the following years there is no listing between No. 44 and No. 58 Gloucester St. Nos. 46-56 Gloucester St are first listed in the Sands, with sixteen occupants, in 1912. The Federation terrace taste for unrendered or face brickwork prompted important developments in building practices and technological developments in the manufacture of building elements. The concerns of the Housing Board, in addition to a general concern about increased durability of materials and ease of construction, may have influenced the design and construction of these buildings. Bricks at this time were generally dry pressed and fired at higher temperatures and therefore harder and more durable, which made sense for this type of public housing. Of greater importance, however, was the adoption of double skin brickwork, which was an innovation of this time. The general concern and requirement for improved and low maintenance materials is emphasised here with the incorporation of more durable elements such as the steel framed stair, wrought iron balustrades and concrete slab to the upper landing in preference to timber detailing typical of this period. The Housing Board, established in 1912, probably took control of the buildings until 1924 when it was disbanded. From this time the Sydney Harbour Trust administered the sites and buildings resumed. It is not clear if any works were carried out during this period. In the 1930s the Maritime Service Board took over management of the area. In 1970 the Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority (SCRA) became the landlords. A report prepared for the Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority dated January 1984 noted that all 16 cottages were occupied at this time. Six of the sixteen were occupied by Housing Commission tenants. It was the policy of the SCRA to provide low cost housing within The Rocks to both those eligible for Housing Commission housing or previous SCRA tenants who had been relocated. At this time it was intended to retain the existing fabric and maintain current Housing Commission standards in terms of amenity and accommodation. A study dated 1984, prepared by Philip Cox and Partners Pty Ltd for SCRA outlined upgrading and development works to the building and site. The study also refers to a parcel land to the immediate north of the site which was considered to be part of the study and at the time contained two derelict cottages. In accordance with the planning strategies of the Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority it was intended to demolish these cottages and use the land to form a link, pocket park between Gloucester and Cambridge Sts. The report included measured drawings of the terraces. The subject building was described as being in fair condition structurally, however, the level of amenities and services were not in accordance with the Housing Commission guidelines of that time. In May 1984, discussions relating to the lease of the buildings were held between the Authority and the then Housing Commission. The proposal provided for a 53-year lease on a minimal rental. Discussions and negotiations continued and it was proposed that the lease term would be extended to 99 years. There was some confusion relating to the rental and other issues between the Authority and Commission including the rehousing of the Authority's tenants, so the agreement or lease was not finalised at this time, although the building was handed over for the commission to administer in January 1985. During 1985 there was further correspondence, but the terms of the occupation beyond year 53 remained unsettled. Whilst this continued the Commission proceeded with the preparation of plans for the refurbishment of the building. In November 1988 Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority formally leased all of the units to the New South Wales Land and Housing Corporation for a term of 99 years, ending in November 2087.Perumal Murphy Alessi Pty Ltd Heritage Consultants 2006  Description  48-56 Gloucester Street, pictured in 2019.

Heritage listing  As at 26 June 2002, Nos. 46-56 Gloucester Street are of State heritage significance for their historic and scientific cultural values. The site and buildings are also of State heritage significance for their contribution to The Rocks area which is of State heritage significance in its own right. The Terraces at Nos. 46-56 Gloucester Street are historically significant as part of the major public works undertaken following the urban clearances in The Rocks. The buildings are good and largely intact early examples of public housing constructed in the first decade of the 20th century probably by the NSW Government Architect's Branch and demonstrate a concern for reasonable building and health standards in the construction and provision of housing to The Rocks residents. The Terraces at Nos. 46-56 Gloucester Street are of historical and social significance due to the association with a number of government bodies including the Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority, Department of Housing their predecessors and their various tenants, who have administered, maintained and occupied the building from its construction. Nos. 46-56 Gloucester Street are technically and aesthetically significant in providing an innovative response to provision of housing on a sloping site, incorporating two storey duplexes that fit into the stepped topography. The stacking of the two storey dwellings also demonstrates a design philosophy and requirement to provide ample public housing and the Government Architects Branch reference to overseas prototypes and models. The Terraces significantly form part of a row of terraces (Nos. 26‚Äì72 with the exception of the No. 42-44, ) that demonstrate the evolution of terrace houses in Australia and are highly visible and make an active contribution to the Gloucester and Cambridge Streets streetscape. The fabric and form of the building is representative of and demonstrates welfare and living standards and evolving construction techniques and materials of the early 20th century. They are a rare example of an early 20th century public housing scheme designed by the NSW Government Architects Branch constructed in The Rocks that also incorporates two storey units. Terraces was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The irregular shape of the site is significant as it represents the early, \\"organic\\" growth of the area and realignment of the street following cleansing operations and attempt to rationalise the natural landform of the area in the first decade of the 20th century. The Terraces at Nos. 46-56 Gloucester Street are historically significant as part of the major public works undertaken following the urban clearances in The Rocks. The buildings are good and intact early examples of public housing constructed in the first decade of the 20th century probably by the NSW Government Architect's Branch and demonstrate a concern for reasonable building and health standards in the construction and provision of housing of The Rocks residents. The construction of the terraces is in part a result of a social and civic concern for the population of local residents and workers displaced by the urban clearances and demolitions. The terraces significantly retain their original form and spatial configuration and have continuously been used for public housing since their construction. The buildings meet this Criterion on a State level. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The Terraces at Nos. 46-56 Gloucester Street are associated with a number of government bodies including the NSW Government Architect's Branch under the leadership of Walter Liberty Vernon, Housing Board, Sydney Harbour Trust, Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority, Housing Commission and later Department of Housing, who have administered and maintained the building from its construction. The Government Architect's Branch prepared a number of schemes for \\"model\\" workers housing. Whilst the design of the terraces reflects the earlier, standard terrace house layout, the \\"stacking\\" of the dwellings and use of roof terraces may have been influenced by overseas prototypes. The housing constructed during this period by the Government Architects Branch, such as Nos. 46-56 Gloucester Street and terraces in Lower Fort Street are most like the later tenements designed by the Housing Board and differed in form and details from those constructed by the Sydney Harbour Trust. The buildings meet this Criterion on a State level. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The Terraces are aesthetically significant as good and largely intact examples of Federation multistorey residential development that retain their original form, fabric and detailing. The buildings were designed to respect the scale of traditional terrace housing but significantly have been adapted to suit the site and local housing requirements. Nos. 46-56 Gloucester Street are technically and aesthetically significant in providing an innovative response to provision of housing on a sloping site, incorporating two storey duplexes that fit into the stepped topography. The incorporation of basement levels allowed the building to be raised and address the higher Gloucester Street address. The stacking of the two storey dwellings also demonstrates a design philosophy and requirement to provide ample public housing adopted by the Government Architect's Branch. The design and form of the building incorporates typical Federation period details such as face brick planes, rough cast rendered detail and timber details to verandah, but also advancements and improvement of building materials in the use of high brick walls, steel and concrete. The Terraces significantly form part of a row of terraces (Nos. 26‚Äì72 with the exception of the No. 42-44, ) that demonstrate the evolution of terrace houses in Australia and reference to overseas models. The buildings occupy a prominent location, on the kink of the street and are highly visible when looking north and south of this section of Gloucester Street, their face brick facades and two storey verandahs being in contrast to the neighbouring bald face, rendered terraces on the eastern side of Gloucester Street. The buildings have a strong visual relationship with the Australian Hotel and make a positive contribution to the Gloucester Street streetscape. The buildings are also visually prominent looking north along Cambridge Street from Cumberland Place. Again the large face brick planes of the south and eastern facades of the building are in contrast to the rendered and painted facades of the neighbouring buildings. The linear nature of the banded brick detail and access verandah on Level 3 reinforces the angle and kink of Gloucester Street. The smaller scale of Susannah Place and curve and form of the buildings also emphasises the aesthetic character of the buildings. The buildings meet this Criterion on a State level. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The terraces at No. 46-56 Gloucester Street have strong association with the Department of Housing and its predecessors and to a lesser extent the Foreshore Authority and its predecessors as one of the earliest public housing properties that has and high social significance in the local community for its continuous provision of public housing in The Rocks area. From 1912 the terraces have continued to be occupied by a number individual and long term Sydney Harbour Trust/ Maritime Services Board/ SCRA, Housing Commission and now Department of Housing tenants. The buildings meet this Criterion on a State level. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Terraces are technically significant for the incorporation of steel framing and concrete slabs and details to the front of the building in contrast to other contemporary buildings and early public housing constructed by the Sydney Harbour Trust which used prominent timber framing and details. This reflects both a consideration of local site conditions, but more so, improvements in building materials and design innovation relating to low maintenance and durability of building fabric, befitting public buildings. The building retains its original form and evidence of the welfare and living standards of the early 20th century, construction techniques and materials. The terraces demonstrate changes in standard of living and technology with the rearrangement of spaces and provision of kitchens, internal wash areas and WCs. The building straddles a sandstone ledge which is indicated along the north and southern site boundaries, however, the cleansing operations and demolitions in the first decade of the 20th century combined with the construction of the terraces would have disturbed most archaeological features or deposits relating to the former uses of the site. However, the houses sit on bedrock and are not cut into the bedrock, therefore wells, cesspits and rock cut features could still exist. The buildings meet this Criterion on a State level. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Terraces are a rare example of an early 20th century public housing scheme designed by the NSW Government Architects Branch and constructed in The Rocks. Other contemporary examples are located in Millers Point or designed by the Housing Board. Nos. 46-56 Gloucester Street are a rare example of the two storey, Federation period public housing dwellings. Other units constructed during this time are single storey. The buildings meet this Criterion on a State level. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The building is a good and largely intact representative example of a public housing complex constructed in the early decades of the 20th century. It is one of the earliest such buildings that represents a shift in the design of housing and contemporary concern for improvement of living conditions and provision of adequate housing following the urban clearances in The Rocks.

Etymology and origins Marichi, a Rishi and son of Brahma. Early 19th century watercolour The name of the pose is from Sanskrit ‡§Æ‡§∞‡•Ä‡§ö‡§ø Marichi, the name of a sage in Hindu mythology, and ‡§Ü‡§∏‡§®, ƒÅsana, meaning posture or seat. The pose is not found in medieval hatha yoga texts, but is described in Krishnamacharya's 1934 Yoga Makaranda and in the teaching of his pupils, B. K. S. Iyengar and Pattabhi Jois. Description Marichyasana III This twisting asana is normally performed sitting, and has several forms. In Marichyasana I, one leg is stretched out straight ahead of the body, the other is bent with the sole of the foot on the floor and the knee up beside the body. The body is twisted towards the side with the straight leg, and the arms are clasped behind the back and around the raised knee. The body may then lean forwards until the nose and chin touch the straight leg. In Marichyasana II, the leg on the ground is folded as for padmasana (lotus), while the other leg is bent as in Marichyasana I; the body is twisted towards the leg on the ground, and the arms are clasped behind the back and around the raised knee. The body may then be leant forwards until the chin touches the knee that is resting on the ground. In Marichyasana III, the leg on the ground is stretched out straight. The body is twisted towards the side with the bent leg, and again the arms are clasped behind the back and around the raised knee. Marichyasana IV puts together the movements of Marichyasana II and III. The leg on the ground is folded as for padmasana; the body is twisted towards the raised knee. This asana may also be performed standing, the foot of the bent leg resting on the seat of a chair and the body turned across the bent leg to face a wall. Benefits Standing Marichyasana is stated to be helpful in relieving backache.

Biography  Ever since childhood, Bergamo lived with complications: at the age of 4 he stuttered, and later on was obese and suffering from a skin disease, turning him into a shy introvert. For the following 13 years he collected knives, among other things, so much so that he always had one on him. After starting work as a welder and carpenter, at the young age of 26, in May 1992, he underwent a surgery to remove one of his testicles.Murderpedia article written by Sara Di Marzio = Murders = Bergamo murdered five women between 1985 and 1992, including a 15-year-old student and four prostitutes, the eldest of whom was 41 years old.Marco Bergamo died - the serial killer of Bolzano on ladige.it On January 3, 1985, the first victim, Marcella Casagrande, a 15-year-old first year student of the nearby Magistral Institute, was found dead in her home. Casagrande had been murdered using a knife with which the killer had good knowledge of using, as well as equally good knowledge of human anatomy, as the girl had suffered several stabs of which one reached the tenth vertebra of the vertebral column. She later held by the hair while the murderer performed the butchering. Just six months after, and precisely on June 26, 41-year-old Anna Maria Cipolletti, a junior high school teacher at \\"Ugo Foscolo\\" who was also involved in prostitution, was found near a studio on 149 Brennero Street. She had been stabbed 19 times, with her underwear stole. In addition, some cigarette butts and used condoms were found, but according to the investigators, there was no sexual violence. After 7 years, a further three prostitutes were murdered, all in 1992. On January 7, 24-year-old Renate Rauch's body was found in a deserted parking lot in the service area of Via Benon in Bolzano. Some days later, some flowers were found on her tomb with a note attached: \\"I'm sorry but what I did, it had to be done and you knew it: bye Renate! Signed MM\\" The police raged the hypothesis that the double \\"M\\" was the name for Marco. On March 21, Bergamo murdered 19-year-old Renate Troger, a blond girl from Millan who, during the night, accepted a lift along Piazza Verdi in Bolzano. Her body was found near Ritten, mutilated and with 14 stab wounds. On August 6, he murdered 20-year- old Marika Zorzi, another prostitute from Laives, found with 28 stab wounds at the second bend of the road that leads to Monte Pozza.The story of Marco Bergamo on trentinocorrierealpi.it  Capture  Bergamo was stopped by two police officers after leaving Bolzano at about 6 AM, or shortly after the last murder, on August 6, 1992, the day of his 26th birthday. Inside his car, a red SEAT Ibiza, he claimed that he was coming from Volta. The authorities immediately suspected that he was a murderer: in fact, on the seat next to the driver's they found bloodstains and the lack of padding as well as the document of the last victim in the trunk of the car; finally, the lack of a rear-view mirror, which was later found at the crime scene.Marco Bergamo on bolzano-scomparsa.it  Trial  Bergamo initially only admitted to murdering three of the five victims; he then denied killing the second victim, Anna Maria Cipolletti and the fourt, Renate Troger. The court, however, on the basis of the evident affinity in which the crimes were executed, condemned him for the five murders, which were committed by a sadistic but fully aware of his actions person.Marco Bergamo dead, the \\"Monster of Bolzano\\" who had killed 5 women on corriere.it However, no connection could be made to the murder of prostitute Anne Maria Ropele on January 8, 1992 at her home in Trento, nor with that of Florentian tourist Adele Barsi, killed on July 20, 1984 near Bruneck; both murders remain unsolved. Various theories about Bergamo's personality began to spread on local newspapers: that of a fetishist, an exhibitionist and a consumer of pornographic material with impotence problems. The Court of Assizes of Bolzano entrusted the investigation to four different experts, who came to different conclusions. The president of the Court of Assizes, Dr. Martinolli, then proposed to rely on an assessment carried out by three professors: Ponti, Fornari and Bruno. They came to the conclusion that: \\"Bergamo has reached extreme perversion: murder for enjoyment. After the first murder he discovered that killing satisfied his pleasures, and at the same time the feared and hated object: the woman. [...] For Bergamo, to kill now represented the extreme sadistic perversion, the strongest way to possess the woman.\\" On March 8, 1994, International Women's Day, Bergamo was convicted. A journalist of the local newspaper Alto Adige, Paolo Cagnan, decided to write to the murderer, who promptly replied: \\"I, Marco Bergamo, committed only three murders and confessed them, the murders of Troger and Cipolletti were committed by a second person potentially more dangerous than me.\\" RAI announced on April 18 of the same year an episode of the television program Un giorno in pretura would be dedicated to Bergamo's trial. During the same day, 72-year-old Renato Bergamo, father of the murderer, went to the attic and hanged himself.  Imprisonment  After spending 24 years in various institutions due to issues related to maximum security, from February 15 he was transferred to the prison of Bollate, the second prison house in Milan. Subsequently, that was during the month of May, the Department of Prison Administration (DAP) disposed of its move to a facility where each prisoner was given the possibility of recovery with the prisoner's objectives and expectations. In 2005, Bergamo obtained a prize permission to leave prison; this news shocked the whole of Italy. As it was only hypothesized, during the summer of 2008 he could have asked for parole to the surveilling judge Guido Rispoli, but he did not receive it. The Court of Assizes of Bolzano in 2014, again through PM Rispoli, had returned to the case concerning Bergamo, but had to reject the request to obtain a judgment by means of an abbreviated rite. In fact, Bergamo could not enjoy this right because it was not intended for life imprisonment, moreover, for the penal code there can be no penalty discounts in cases such as these, or with final and irrevocable sentences.  Death  At 51, while still serving his sentence at the Bollate prison near Milan, Bergamo asked the hospital's director to be urgently transferred, where he found that Marco had a serious lung infection. After 10 days he went into a coma without awaking, dying on October 17, 2017.

Her experiences competing against male racers helped her dominate the women's division of motocross racing. After dominating women's motocross, Gonzalez made the decision to switch to stadium off-road racing competing in the superlight cars class of the Mickey Thompson off-road series with future NASCAR racer Jimmie Johnson as her teammate. She won a race at Denver's Mile High Stadium to become the first woman to win a Mickey Thompson off-road event. Gonzalez then started a career in downhill mountain bike racing where, against much younger competitors, she finished second overall to Leigh Donovan at the 1995 UCI Mountain Bike World Championships and, followed with a 6th place finish in the 1996 UCI Mountain Bike World Championships before retiring at the age of 36.

The design forms a scaled series with the Hunter 306 and the 356. Production The design was built by Hunter Marine in the United States starting in 2001, but it is now out of production. Design The Hunter 326 is a small recreational keelboat, built predominantly of fiberglass reinforced with kevlar. It has a fractional sloop B&R; rig, a raked stem, an open walk-through reverse transom with integral swim ladder, an internally-mounted spade-type rudder controlled by a wheel and a fixed fin keel.

He was initially trained in Italy where he was one of the best juvenile colts of 2007, winning six races (four of them at Listed level) and finishing runner-up in the Group 1 Gran Criterium. He was then acquired by Godolphin but had training problems and missed the whole of the next season. He reached his peak in the early part of 2009 when he won his first three races in Dubai including emphatic victories in the Al Fahidi Fort and the Dubai Duty Free. He was less successful when campaigned in Europe but recorded a final major victory when taking the Premio Vittorio di Capua and was rated one of the best racehorses in the world at the end of the year. In 2019 Gladiatorus alongside Nocturnal Fox is standing in John Lynch's Windmill View Stud Ballinasloe County Galway Ireland. Notably Windmill View Stud produced Just A Par sired by Island House, foaled by TheBrownHen. Background Gladiatorus is a bay horse with a white star and snip and three white socks bred in Kentucky by the Italian breeding company Azienda Agricola le Ferriere di Raponi Giampaolo. In October 2006 the yearling colt was consigned to the Fasig-Tipton sale and was bought for $8,000 by the bloodstock agent Federico Barberini. He was imported to Italy where entered the ownership of the Razza Dell'Olmo stable and was sent into training with Riccardo Menichetti. He was the probably the best racehorse sired by Silic, a French-bred stallion who had his greatest success on North American, tracks, winning the Breeders' Cup Mile in 1999. Gladiatorus's dam Gmaasha never raced but was a daughter of the exceptional racehorse and broodmare Al Bahathri. Racing career=2007: two-year-old season= Gladiatorus began his racing career in the Premio Germanio over 1400 metres at Naples Racecourse on 7 June when he started at odds of 7.9/1 and won by one and three quarter lengths from the favourite Jay Force. Nine days later he was stepped up in class for the Group 3 Premio Primi Passi at the San Siro racecourse in Milan in which he came home sixth of the eleven runners behind his stablemate Magritte. He was then dropped back in class and ran up three quick wins, taking the Premio Tommy Way over 1500 metres at Naples on 1 July, the Listed Criterium Partenopeo over the same course and distance two weeks later and the Listed Criterium Varesino over 1600 metres at Varese on 4 August. His run came to an end on 19 August in the Criterium Labronico at Livorno Racecourse when he was beaten into second place by the filly Yacht Woman. In the Listed Premio Toscana over 1500 metres at Florence on 9 September the colt returned to winning form, leading for most of the way and coming home a length in front of Eldest. For his last two races of the season, Gladiatorus was transferred to the training stable of Maria Rita Salvioni. On his first run for his new trainer, the colt was ridden by Germano Marcelli and started at odds of 3.75/1 for the Listed Premio Rumon over 1600 metres at the Capannelle Racecourse in Rome on 30 September. Racing on heavy ground he led from the start, drew clear of his rivals in the straight and won \\"comfortably\\" by three lengths. Gladiatorus was partnered by Frankie Dettori when he contested Italy's most prestigious race for two-year-olds, the Group 1 Gran Criterium at San Siro and started the 3.9/1 fourth choice in a nine- runner field. He went well clear of his opponents is the straight but was overtaken 200 metres from the finish and beaten half a length by the British- trained favourite Scintillo. At the end of the year Gladiatorus was acquired by Sheikh Mohammed's Godolphin organisation and was sent to be trained in Dubai by Saeed bin Suroor. =2009: four-year-old season= Gladiatorus missed the whole of the 2008 season. In the early part of 2009 he raced in the colours of Sheikh Mohammed's son Mansour and was trained by Mubarak bin Shafya. Godolphin's racing manager Simon Crisford later explained. \\"We had him in Dubai the winter after we bought him and he returned to Newmarket with the rest of the string for the British season. But he proved to have a slight issue with his pelvis, the faintest of fractures, and he was a big, weak sort of horse anyway, so the decision was made to back off him and give him the time to develop he needed. We sent him off to Mubarak's stable in the desert, away from our training centre and the racecourse.\\" He began his campaign on 22 January in a handicap race over 1550 metres at Nad Al Sheba Racecourse in which he was ridden by Ahmed Ajtebi. He took the lead after 300 metres, drew away in the straight and won by two and a half lengths from the favourite Calming Influence. On 19 February he was moved up to Group 2 class for the Al Fahidi Fort over 1600 metres at the same track and started second favourite behind the South African gelding Imbongi. Ridden by Royston Ffrench he took the lead early and was never seriously challenged, pulling away from his opponents in the straight and winning \\"easily\\" by almost six lengths. After the race Ffrench commented \\"I was never concerned; the trainer said he was a really nice horse and to ride him confidently from the front. It has certainly worked well!\\". On 28 March, with Ajtebi in the saddle, Gladiatorus was one of sixteen horses to contest the Dubai Duty Free over 1800 metres at Nad Al Sheba. The Queen Elizabeth II Cup winner Archipenko started favourite, while the other runners in an international field included Paco Boy, Vodka, Creachadoir, Presvis, Kip Deville and Jay Peg. Gladiatorus went to the front soon after the start, opened up a clear advantage approaching the straight and came home three and a quarter lengths in front of Presvis. Ajtebi, a former camel racing jockey said after the race \\"I always said I wanted the UAE to be proud of me and I hope the country is now. We were always going to attack from the front as that's how he won last time. This is a dream come true and I am so grateful to everyone in helping me get where I am now\\". Mubarak bin Shayfa commented \\"He's a special horse. I thought he would win easy\\". After his win in the Duty Free, Gladiatorus was taken back into Godolphin's ownership and was sent to England, where he was trained by Saeed bin Suroor. The horse was campaigned in Europe but his form was initially disappointing as he ran sixth behind Paco Boy in when favourite for the Queen Anne Stakes at Royal Ascot in June and then came home a remote eighth of nine behind Goldikova in the Prix Jacques Le Marois at Deauville Racecourse in August. He produced a slightly better effort at Longchamp Racecourse on 9 September when he finished fifth of eight behind Aqlaam in the Prix du Moulin. On 11 October Gladiatorus returned to Italy for the first time in almost two years to contest the Group 1 Premio Vittorio di Capua over 1600 metres at San Siro. Ridden by Ajtebi he started the 1.8/1 favourite ahead of ten opponents including Major Cadeaux (Sandown Mile) from England, Wislide (Prix Chlo√©) from France and Precious Boy (Mehl- Mulhens-Rennen) from Germany. Employing his customary front-running style, Gladiatorus was never seriously challenged and won by four and a half lengths. For his final start, Gladiatorus was sent to California for the Breeders' Cup Mile at Santa Anita Park on 7 November. He held a narrow lead for most of the way but was overtaken a quarter of a mile from the finish and faded to come home ninth of the eleven runners behind Goldikova. In the 2009 World Thoroughbred Rankings Gladiatorus was given a rating of 125, making him the seventh-best racehorse in the world. Stud record At the end of his racing career Gladiatorus was retired to become a breeding stallion at the Allevamento di Besnate in Italy. For the 2018 season he moved to the Withyslade Farm in Wiltshire, England. The best of his offspring has been the Listed winner Presley. Pedigree *Gladiatorus is inbred 3 √ó 3 to Blushing Groom, beaning that this stallion appears twice in the third generation of his pedigree.

In 1999 it changed its name to Best Work (Other), and when the Prix Aurora and Prix Boreal combined, the awards adopted the name Best Related Work in 2012. In 1983, two non-fiction works were recognized separately from other works, but neither were given an award. The French Award was not granted several times in 2003, 2005 and 2008 as there were insufficient entries.

The company claims that 46 out of the top 50 commercial real estate owners use one of its products. It is listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange, with a market capitalization of around $1 billion as of 2017. The company has annual revenue of $475 million, 2,500 employees, and 75 offices.  History  Altus Group was founded in 2005, through the merger of three Canadian real estate consultancies, one of which was led by its first CEO, Gary Yeoman. Yeoman had previously managed the real estate portfolio of car parts manufacturer Magna Inc. Altus listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange as an income trust in that year. It originally focused on consulting services for the commercial real estate industry. In 2006, it expanded into the oil- and-gas land surveying industry in Western Canada, through the acquisition of All West surveys for $51.5 million. In its first five years, the company expanded significantly, primarily through acquisition. It purchased a number of American tax consultancies in the aftermath of the Great Recession. In 2010, it converted to a standard corporation, due to the change in tax treatment of income trusts. In 2011, the company purchased Argus Software, a real estate software company, for $130 million. The purchase was part of an attempted expansion into the software industry. However, the company incurred significant debt to finance the acquisition, and reduced its dividend by 50%. As a result, the firm's share price fell by 80% in 2011, and the Mr. Yeoman, the CEO, resigned in November 2011. In 2012, the current CEO, Robert Courteau, joined the company. In 2014, it acquired Realnet, a real estate data firm, as part of an attempted expansion by the company into residential real estate services. In 2017, it acquired Australian real estate valuation software company EstateMaster. In July 2019, Altus acquired One11 Advisors, a real estate software consulting services firm.  Business  The company has three business segments: Altus Analytics, Commercial Real Estate Consulting, and Geomatics. Altus Analytics primarily provides software and data for commercial and residential real estate companies. Its commercial real estate consulting is primarily focused on property tax and valuation advice; the company has 60% of the Canadian market in property tax consulting, is the second largest company in that market in the United Kingdom, and third largest in the United States. Geomatics is principally focused on land surveys for the oil-and-gas industry. As of 2017, Altus had total revenue of $478 million, 35% from Altus Analytics, 55% from commercial real estate consulting, and other 10% from Geomatics. 45% of their revenue was from Canada, 38% was from the United States, 11% was from Europe, and the other 6% was from the Asia-Pacific. Significant competitors of Altus include Ryan LLC (in tax advisory), CoStar Group (in software), and CoreLogic (in software).  Revenue  In May 2020, Altus Group Limited fell short of the target which resulted in a loss of CA$0.10. Following the latest earnings results, eight analysts tracking Altus Group settled on revenues of CA$542.6m in 2020, suggesting a significant sales drop of 6.7% relative to the last 12 months.

Depictions of him in popular culture have fluctuated between a cold-blooded murderer without a heart and a sentimental hero fighting for justice. The Texas historian, J. Frank Dobie, wrote many years ago in A Vaquero of the Brush Country (1929): \\"...Billy the Kid will always be interesting, will always appeal to the popular imagination\\". While a plethora of writers and filmmakers have depicted Billy the Kid as the personification of either heroic youth or juvenile punk, a few have attempted to portray a more complex character. In any case, the dramatic aspects of his short life and violent death still appeal to popular taste, and he remains an icon of teenage rebellion and nonconformity. The mythologizing of his story continues with new works in various media.

November 2018 History At the beginning of 1972, the innovation researcher Helmar Krupp (de) recommended that the natural science and technology-oriented Fraunhofer Society should found a new institute to research the impacts and potentials of technologies and innovations. This recommendation was followed on 1 April 1972 with the establishment of the Fraunhofer Institute for System Technology and Innovation Research in Karlsruhe ‚Äì under Helmar Krupp as its director. Frieder Meyer- Krahmer (de) took over as director from 1990. Under his management, the institute became one of the internationally leading innovation research institutes. This resulted in it being renamed ‚ÄúFraunhofer Institute for Systems and Innovation Research‚Äù in 2004 because ‚ÄúSystem Technology‚Äù was no longer considered suitable for the institute that had since grown to well over 100 employees. In 2005, Meyer-Krahmer was appointed State Secretary of the German Federal Ministry of Education and Marion Weissenberger-Eibl (de) has been the director of Fraunhofer ISI since April 2007. Under her leadership, futures research has become a core competence at the institute. In 2007, the institute was restructured and its individual departments were turned into Competence Centers with specialized Business Units.

Elbert Williams (1908-1940) Williams is known to be the first NAACP member to be lynched and/or murdered for his civil rights activities.Sullivan, P. (2010). Lift every voice the Naacp and the making of the civil rights movement. New York: New Press. Williams was born in rural Haywood County, Tennessee to a sharecropper family. His parents were Mary Green and Albert Williams. His grandfather was a slave He received education until eighth grade at public schools, although there were no buildings for black elementary students. Williams married his high-school sweetheart Annie Mitchell in 1929. The Great Depression prevented Williams and his wife from farming, so they moved to Brownsville in the early 1930s. They found work at the Sunshine Laundry where Elbert worked as a fireman and Annie worked as a presser. On June 12, 1939, Williams and other members of Brownsville established a local chapter of the NAACP.Catherwood, H. (2012) In the Absence of Governmental Protection. The Struggle of the Brownsville Naacp to Secure the Right to Vote(dissertation). The branch was the fifth branch in Tennessee. Elbert and Annie were both charter members. Although African-Americans were legally allowed to vote, African-Americans were not permitted to vote in Brownsville. The goal of the chapter was to register and exercise their right to vote. On the night of June 20, 1940, Sheriff Samuel ‚ÄúTip‚Äù Hunter and police officer Charles Reed took Williams from his home and jailed him to interrogate him about the NAACP. Hunter claimed to have released Williams. Williams was never seen alive after this night. Three days later on the morning of June 23, 1940, Williams's body was found in the Hatchie River. He had been murdered and identified by his wife. In August 1940, a Grand Jury was convened and ruled William's death as a homicide by parties unknown. This was the last recorded lynching in Tennessee. On June 20, 2015 a historical marker for Williams was unveiled in Haywood County. His murder case has been reopened under the Tennessee's new Civil Rights Crime Cold Case Law of 2018. District Attorney Garry G. Brown for the 28th Judicial District of Tennessee reopened the case in August 2018.Grinberg, E. (2018, August 10). The killing of an NAACP activist will be investigated 78 years later.  Brownsville NAACP and Voting Rights  At the time, Haywood County was one of three counties in Tennessee in which African Americans were not permitted to vote. On May 6, 1940, Reverend Buster Walker, president, Taylor Newburn and Elisha Davis, each executive member of the NAACP as well as members John Lester and John Gaines, visited the county registrar's office with intentions to register to vote. The five members were directed to Judge J.T. Pearson who pointed them to the Electoral Commission to register. The members were told that registration would not begin until August. After the members attempted to vote, members of the white community began to threaten the members of the NAACP. Reverend Walker and Davis received threats from the police chief, the mayor, and former mayor that there would be trouble if any African American were registered or were encouraged to register to vote. The members of the NAACP nor any African American of Brownsville registered to vote for the 1940 election.  Lynching  Before the lynching of Williams, he was negotiating the purchase of Elisha Davis's gas station. This deal would have made Williams a business owner. Williams was already a member of the NAACP, so being a business owner would have elevated his role in society which was a threat to white southerners. Early morning at 1:00 am on June 16, 1940, Davis was taken from his house by a white mob of about 50 to 60 people which was led by Hunter and Reed. The mob first drove to Reverend Buster Walker's house, however, he could not be found. The mob then took him to Hatchie River where he was interrogated about the NAACP. One of the mob members Alber Mann, a local businessman, threatened Davis's life and then later told him Davis would be let go if he gave the mob information about the NAACP chapter and its members. Davis told them information of members that were already public knowledge. After the mob released Davis, he promised to leave town and fled to Jacksonville. Elbert Williams Death Certificate Just a few days later on June 20, 1940, Hunter and Reed, and Coca-Cola plan manager Ed Lee showed up to Williams‚Äô home late at night. Dressed for bed and barefoot, Williams was forced to step out of his home to speak with Hunter and Reed. He was asked questions and then was forced into the car and driven away. That was the last time Annie Williams saw her husband of eleven years alive. Hunter drove Williams and another man Thomas Davis, Elisha Davis's younger brother, to the police station where they were jailed. After questioning Davis and Williams about their NAACP activity, Davis was released into a crowd of 40 to 50 white men at about 1:30 am. Annie walked to City Hall where Williams was supposed to be been held and could not find him. Annie spoke to Reed, who did not report having see Williams. On the morning of June 23, 1940, a fisherman found Williams's body in the Hatchie River. The undertaker Al Rawls asked to meet Annie at the river so she could identify the body. Annie saw that Williams had holes in his chest and there were visible bruises indicating he had been beaten. Williams‚Äô head looked twice its size because it had been beaten so badly. His hands and feet were bound. His neck was wrapped with a rope that was attached to a log to ensure he stays underwater. The coroner instructed that the body be immediately buried. On the same day that his body was found, Williams was buried at the Taylor Cemetery in Brownsville. The Hatchie River was recorded as the place of death for Williams and the cause of death was listed as unknown.  Federal and State Investigation  The Tennessee State authorities convened a grand jury under Judge W.W. Bond. According to the foreman of the grand jury, after a three-day investigation of the grand jury, there is no evidence found to identify a person who was the cause of the violent outbreaks. Williams's death was investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Justice Department[4]. William McCalahan was the United States Attorney for the state of Tennessee led the investigation.Congress, R. (2001). Blues mandolin man: the life and music of Yank Rachell. Jackson: University Press of Mississippi. The secretary of the NAACP, Walter White, aided McCalahan with the NAACP's report of the events in Brownsville. The local FBI prepared a report on the case that indicated doubts that any laws had been violated and questioned the need for further investigation. On July 12, 1940, Assistant Attorney General John Rogge told the NAACP of Brownsville that he has requested the FBI to actively investigate the case. On November 28, 1940, the United States Attorney's office in Memphis told the FBI that no more contacts of the case needed to be investigated. On March 31, 1941, Assistant Attorney General Wendell Berge sent a letter to McCalahan stating that the federal law was violated and the FBI should continue its investigation. McCalahan presented an FBI report to Berge In September 1941 and on October 2, Berge wrote that the Department has decided to take the case to a grand jury. On December 23, Victor Rotem, Chief of the Civil Rights Section at the Department of Justice, released a memorandum that Williams's case did not provide enough evidence to present to a trial jury. In January 1942, a year and a half after the assault and murder of Williams, the Justice Department determined that there was not sufficient enough evidence to warrant prosecution.

She worked on the improvement of potato production in Pakistan and became known for her work on tissue culture. She was given the Borlaug Award in 1997 and the Ordre des Palmes acad√©miques in 2002. She is credited with raising potato production in Pakistan by 5%. Early life and education Quraishi was born in 1945 in Rajasthan, India, to Abdus Sattar Quraishi and Salma Quraishi. Her family moved to Rawalpindi in Pakistan in the upheaval caused by the British orchestrated \\"partition of India\\". She obtained her first degree from Gordon College in her home city and, in 1966, she obtained her master's degree from the University of the Punjab in Lahore. After lecturing for several years at Viqar-un-Nisa Girls College in Rawalpindi, Quraishi traveled overseas on a Government of Pakistan scholarship. As a result, she obtained a master's degree in 1973 for her tissue culture research on Solanum tuberosum var., BF-15. Within three years she had obtained her doctorate from the University of Paris-Sud in Orsay, France for related work which was a \\"Study of callogenesis and organogenesis from explant of in vitro shoots in Solanum tuberosum var., BF-15\\". Scientific career Azra Quraishi created virus-free seed potatoes in Pakistan. This research affected her country's trading position as it reduced the need to import seed potatoes from the Netherlands as she had increased Pakistan's annual potato production by 5%. This contribution brought her national recognition. Azra Quraishi also \\"successfully launched projects of micropropagation of banana, date palm, and screening salt tolerance through tissue culture in local wheat and rice cultivars.\\" She had published more than 140 research papers. Awards and recognition Her contributions earned Azra Quraishi many awards: * Hamdard Pakistan Award in 1992 * Norman Borlaug Award for Field Research and Application in 1997 *Pakistan Agricultural Research Council (PARC/PARSA) Millenium Award for Best Scientist in 2001 * France's Ordre des Palmes acad√©miques in 2002 At a memorial ceremony in Islamabad on 26 November 2002, Badruddin Soomro, Chairman PARC, announced that the Institute of Agriculture Biotechnology and Genetics Research (IABGR) would be renamed in Quraishi's honour. Soomro acknowledged that the glass ceiling had prevented Quraishi from the promotion she deserved. She had been promoted to be the Chief Scientific Officer and Deputy Director General, Agriculture Biotechnology Institute, Pakistan Agricultural Research Council (PARC). Quraishi had no children but she contributed towards her nephew and the financial costs of dozens of poor children. Azra Quraishi was a member of several societies including the Pakistan Botanical Society. Publications Quraishi published over 140 scientific research papers in internationally recognized scientific journals and 85 popular science articles. Quraishi participated in over 70 national and international conferences, symposia or seminars in Pakistan, India, Canada, Egypt, Philippine, USA, UK, India, Jordan, Bangladesh, and, in the month before her death, China.

Zucrow was born in Kiev and immigrated with his family to the UK in 1900. Young Maurice attended Central Foundation Boys' School in London. The family moved to the US in 1914. In 1922 Maurice Zucrow became the first person to graduate with a BS degree in engineering from Harvard University. He went on to receive a S.M degree from the same school next year. Zucrow was also the first recipient of a doctoral degree in engineering at Purdue University completing his dissertation in Mechanical Engineering in 1928. His PhD advisor was Andrey Abraham Potter, Dean of Purdue University College of Engineering. After leaving Purdue in 1929, Zucrow spent 17 years in industry. During his work at Elliott Company, he played an important part in the research and development of the nation's first gas turbine built in 1942. He also helped develop Aerojet‚Äôs JATO rocket, used by seaplanes to assist takeoff under adverse conditions. During the World War II, Zucrow was asked to teach a course in jet propulsion theory to engineers in the aircraft industry as part of the Engineering, Science, and Management War Training (ESMWT) program at the University of California, Los Angeles. The house Zucrows built in 1951 in West Lafayette, IN. The family lived here until Maurice's retirement from Purdue. In 1946 he joined the faculty of Purdue School of Aeronautics and Astronautics establishing Purdue's Jet Propulsion Center. The research facility was renamed Maurice J. Zucrow Propulsion Laboratories in 1998 and is now the world's largest academic propulsion laboratory. In 1948 Zucrow published Principles of Jet Propulsion and Gas Turbines, the first textbook in this field. In 1957 Zucrow was elected to the board of directors of American Rocket Society together with Wernher von Braun. In 1962 Zucrow received the Sigma Xi national research award and delivered the award lecture entitled \\"Space Propulsion Engines - Their Characteristics and Problems\\".

As the highest official in charge of the Spanish international cooperation, the SECIPIC is also the President of the Spanish Agency for International Development Cooperation (AECID). History The international cooperation and development policy of Spain exists since the Francoist Spain and the relations with Latin America since the independence of their current states. During the first years of democracy, the competences over this matters were attached to bodies with the rank of directorate-general or less, however, the socialist government of Felipe Gonzalez decided in 1985 to create the current Secretariat of State with the aim to get an \\"effective cooperation with all the peoples of the Earth\\", a mandate collected in the preamble of the Spanish Constitution (Constitution ¬ß Preamble). Although international cooperation for development is destined for countries around the world, due to historical and cultural ties most of this Spanish cooperation goes to Latin America and the former Spanish territories of Africa like Equatorial Guinea, Morocco or Western Sahara, and also to Asian countries such as the Philippines, also former Spanish territories. The most significant change since its creation was in 2004, when the competencies of the foreign policy of Spain in Ibero-American were transferred to the Secretariat of State for Foreign Affairs, competences that were recovered in very late 2011.

Description The length of the shell attains 25 mm, its diameter 8.3 mm. (Original description) The shell is of medium size moderately slender. The spire is fusiform. The whorls are subangulate. The protoconch consists of 1¬Ω smooth whorls, the first full turn slightly tilted and moderately small. The aperture is about half as long as shell, moderately narrow. The outer lip is thin and rounded, recurving sharply to the anal sinus. The columella is of moderate length and straight. The anal sinus is moderately broad and deep, adjacent to the suture and showing only a slight amount of recurving from the apex of the sinus to the suture. The sculpture consists of inclined axials, about eight visible from an angle on the young whorls but becoming obsolete on the body whorl. Medium textured raised spiral lines below the periphery, extending with about equal strength to the tip of the columella. The subsutural slope is sculptured with similar lines which are weaker immediately above the periphery, but stronger near the suture. There seems to be no relative of this species described from the western Pacific region. It differs from the type of Leucosyrinx in being slenderer and having more regular spiral markings, those of L. verrilli being discontinuous near the periphery. The axial nodes of L. verrilli are shorter and somewhat stronger. Distribution Fossils of this marine species were found in Miocene strata of Okinawa.

Features of this condition include * Short trunk * Poor growth * Hydrocephalus * Multiple fractures * Craniofacial abnormalities ** Multisutural craniosynostosis ** Ocular proptosis ** Marked frontal bossing ** Midface hypoplasia ** Micrognathia Genetics There are three forms of this syndrome.

Am J Med Genet A 167A(3):587-91. doi: 10.1002/ajmg.a.36916 Clinically these forms are very similar and are best differentiated by gene sequencing. Pathogensis Protein disulfide-isomerase is involved in the hydroxylation of proline residues in preprocollagen. Protein transport protein Sec24D is a protein involved in vesicle transport. How mutations in the gene cause disease is not yet clear. Cartilage associated protein is involved in post translation modifications of collagen. Diagnosis The diagnosis may be suspected on the basis of the constellation of clinical features. It is made by sequencing the P4HB, SEC24D and CRTAP genes. =Differential diagnosis= * Pfeiffer syndrome * Osteogenesis imperfecta * Osteoglophonic dwarfism Treatment There is no specific treatment for this condition currently known and management of its various features is the norm.

It has a typical apparent visual magnitude of 16.5, but reached a magnitude of 8.5 during the only observed outburst. System When it was discovered in 2003, during the quiescent phase, V455 Andromedae was classified as a cataclysmic variable, since its spectrum is similar to U Geminorum. V455 Andromedae is therefore a binary star where the primary is a white dwarf that is accreting matter from the secondary donor star. The rotation period of the white dwarf, slightly less than 68 seconds, is shorter than the orbital period so the white dwarf must possess a magnetic field channelling the material from the accretion disk to the poles of the white dwarf. This qualifies V455 Andromedae as a cataclysmic variable of the intermediate polar type. The spin period is expected to become shorter with time, but to date only upper limits on its decreasing trend has been determined. The mass of the donor star is only . This low mass makes V455 Andromedae similar to WZ Sagittae dwarf novae, which are expected to have a long period between outbursts. Variability Eclipses in the light curve of V455 Andromedae revealed the binary nature of this star and its orbital period. Only one outburst event has been observed so far: V455 Andromedae brightened by 8 magnitudes during 2007. Such a large increase in brightness implies that this was a superoutburst, and V455 Andromedae is therefore a dwarf nova of the SU Ursae Majoris type. Superhumps were observed during the outburst. Superhumps have also been reported during quiescence, known as permanent superhumps. An positive superhump was observed in 2000 - 2003, while negative superhumps were seen in 2013 and 2014. This is the first time negative superhumps have been detected in WZ sagittae dwarf novae during quiescence. V455 Andromedae shows spectroscopic variations in its line profiles with a period of 3.5 hours. This is taken to be the precession period of a warped accretion disk, possibly retrograde precession. The white dwarf primary pulsates radially with periods of about five or six minutes. These are considered to be incoherent, or possibly to consist of too many different periods to be analysed. Further brightness oscillations are seen with a period of , which is a beat period between the spin period and the spectroscopic period.

She is a member of the French Council of Economic Analysis. Her research focuses on public finance‚Äîin particular questions of optimal taxation. In 2018, she was selected by The Economist as one of the 8 best young economists of the decade.In 2020, she was awarded the Elaine Bennett Research Prize.  Career  Stantcheva's interest in economics had its roots in the economic turmoil of her homeland Bulgaria after it turned away from Communism in the 1990s. After completing her secondary education in France, she obtained her Bachelor of Arts degree in economics from University of Cambridge in 2007, a MS in economics and finance from √âcole Polytechnique in 2008, and a MS in economics from ENSAE and Paris School of Economics in 2009. She received her Ph.D. in economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 2014. Since 2014, Stantcheva has been employed at Harvard University. From 2014 to 2016 she was a Junior Fellow at Harvard Society of Fellows. She was an Assistant Professor 2016‚Äì17, an Associate Professor 2017‚Äì18 and was promoted to a full Professor in May 2018. She has founded and runs the Social Economics Lab at Harvard, that runs large-scale online surveys in many countries to understand how people think, how they form their perceptions, beliefs, and attitudes, and how their views on economic and social policies emerge. Stantcheva is a 2018 Sloan Research Fellow, a 2017 Harvard University Furer Fellow, and an NSF CAREER Award Recipient. She was part of the 2014 Review of Economic Studies' Tour. She was selected as the best French young Economist in 2019 by the journal Le Monde and the Cercle des √âconomistes. She was awarded the Young Economist Award from the Fondation France-Israel in 2019. Stantcheva currently teaches undergraduate and graduate Public Economics at Harvard University and has taught other Economics and Policy courses in the past. Professional activities Stantcheva is an Associate Editor of the Journal of Political Economy (from May 2017), of the Quarterly Journal of Economics (from August 2018), and of the American Economic Review (from August 2018). In 2016 and 2017, she received the Excellence in Refereeing Award from the American Economic Review. In 2018 she was appointed as a member of the French Council of Economic Analysis (Conseil d'Analyse Economique), a non-partisan advisory body to the French Prime Minister. Research Stantcheva's research concerns public finance‚Äîin particular, the question of how tax and transfer systems can better simultaneously raise revenues, reduce inequality, and foster the productivity of firms and individuals. She focuses on three aspects of optimal taxation: 1) the dynamic effects of taxation, 2) the corrective role of taxation in the presence of asymmetric information and other market failures, and 3) social preferences and perceptions to understand the determinants of tax policy. She combines theory and empirical work. In the Social Economics Lab at Harvard University that she founded, she has developed the use of large-scale, cross-country Social Economic Surveys and experiments to study how people form their views about policies and their social attitudes. She has more particularly focused on the perceptions of intergenerational mobility, immigration, and inequality and their link to support for redistribution. These Social Economics Surveys are rigorous research tools that can shed light on what is invisible in order datasets: perceptions, beliefs, reasoning, attitudes, views, and detailed individual economic circumstances. Together with Emmanuel Saez and Thomas Piketty, she has presented a model of optimal labor income taxation for top incomes, taking into account standard labor supply responses as well as tax avoidance and compensation bargaining.Thomas Piketty, Emmanuel Saez and Stefanie Stantcheva: Optimal Taxation of Top Labor Incomes A Tale of Three Elasticities. American Economic Journal: Economic Policy, 2014, 6 (1), p. 230-271. In another project together with Emmanuel Saez she has characterized optimal taxation of capital income.Emmanuel Saez and Stefanie Stantcheva: A simpler theory of optimal capital taxation. Journal of Public Economics, 2018, 162, p. 120-142. Stantcheva has studied the interplay between taxation and innovation, examining the effects of personal and corporate income taxation on innovation and thinking about how to better design the tax system and R&D; policies to foster innovation. In \\"Taxation and Innovation in the 20th Century\\" she analyzes the impacts of individual and corporate income taxes on individual inventors, firms that do R&D;, and on innovation at the state level in the U.S. throughout the 20th century. She has also shown that top personal tax rates affect the international location choices of superstar inventors. Media Stantcheva has made numerous appearances in the media both as an author and a speaker. Stantcheva has written articles and appeared in video essays by Vox. Recently Stantcheva spoke in a Vox video entitled \\"Where does Innovation come from?\\". Stantcheva has also given many lectures and talks, some of which are filmed.

She later worked as a clinical psychologist in the New York State health system and at the Veteran's Administration Hospital in Perry Point, Maryland (late 1940s-1967).  Education  Ball earned her A.B. from Columbia University in 1922. She then worked as an assistant in psychology for Karl Lashley at the University of Minnesota from 1923‚Äì1926. In 1926, Ball published her first paper in \\"The female sex cycle as a factor in learning in the rat,\\" one of the first papers on the role of hormones in learning and memory. She also later published a study with Lashley, ‚ÄúSpinal conduction and kinesthetic sensitivity in the maze habit,‚Äù which demonstrated that rats trained to run a maze can still run the maze without afferent sensory input via the spinal cord. From January to June 1924, Ball accompanied Robert Yerkes on the University of California-sponsored trip to Cuba to visit Madame Rosal√≠a Abreu‚Äôs primate colony. Abreu, the daughter of a wealthy Cuban plantation owner and the world's first animal keeper, kept a captive breeding colony of chimpanzees. The goal of the expedition was to establish a long-term colony to observe behavior of apes. In 1927, Ball moved to the University of California, Berkeley where she worked as a teaching fellow in psychology and as a research assistant in the lab of anatomist, embryologist, and endocrinologist Herbert McLean Evans. In 1929, she earned her Ph.D. from the University of California, as well as a diplomate from the American Board of Examiners of Professional Psychologists. Her thesis, ‚ÄúMeasurement of Sexual Behavior in Male Rats‚Äù was an 18-month study of 61 subjects under repeated and standardized conditions.  Career  After graduation, Ball moved to Baltimore, Maryland accepted a position as an assistant psychobiologist at the Henry Phipps Psychiatric Clinic at Johns Hopkins University Hospital. Almost immediately, she began collaborating with Carl Gottfried Hartman, Director of the Carnegie Institute of Washington. She later joined the Department of Embryology at the Institute, where she was primarily associated with Hartman an expert in ovarian physiology and embryology, and later with his successor George Corner, co- discover of the hormone progesterone. Both Hartman and Corner encouraged Ball's behavioral experiments, which included sexual excitability in Rhesus macaque monkeys across the menstrual cycle (1935), the first demonstration of sexual receptivity in ovariectomized monkeys by injections of estrogen (1936) and the inhibition of sexual receptivity by injections of progesterone (1939). She also documented a case of imitative learning in the monkey (1938). In addition, throughout the 1930s and early 1940s she published a number of fundamental studies during this time period investigating sexual behaviors of both male and female rats, with a special emphasis on the role of hormones and other aspects of physiology in the behavior. Ball left Baltimore in 1941 and held a series of short-term positions. From 1942‚Äì1943, she was a research associate at Cornell University‚Äôs College of Home Economics. From 1943-1945, she accepted a position as an assistant professor in the psychology department at Vassar College. From 1945-1947, she held an assistant professorship at Connecticut‚Äôs Hartford Junior College and was a clinical psychologist at the University of Connecticut‚Äôs Institute of Living, which marked the beginning of Ball‚Äôs career in the field of clinical psychology. In 1948, Ball worked as a clinical psychologist for the New York State health system. From 1948-1950, she worked as a senior psychologist at the Rockland State Hospital. From 1950-1955, she served a field supervisor for the New York State Psychological Intern Training Program. She was also the assistant director of psychological services for the New York State Department of Mental Hygiene from 1954-55. In addition, she served as the secretary of the New York State Psychological Association from 1951-1952. In 1955, Ball returned to Maryland as a research psychologist associated with the now controversial lobotomy research project at the Veterans Administration Hospital in Perry Point, Maryland. Most lobotomies were conducted between 1947 and 1950 and the procedure fell out of favor as tranquilizer drugs became available in the mid-1950s. Ball researched the consequences of lobotomies in a large-scale study and was lead author on the paper, ‚ÄúThe Veterans Administration study of prefrontal lobotomy,‚Äù published in 1959. In 1959, she left lobotomy research to work as a clinical psychologist at the Veterans Administration Hospital, focusing on gerontology. She remained in this position until her retirement in 1967.  Research Contributions  Ball became elected as an associate member of the American Psychological Association in 1930 and became a full member in 1937. She also became a fellow of the Gerontological Society in 1957. Ball's research on the role of hormones and behavior was some of the earliest in the field, contemporaneous with work of Willam Caldwell (W.C) Young and preceding the work of Frank A. Beach, both of whom were considered founders of the field of behavioral neuroendocrinology. Ball's first paper in 1926 represented the earliest work on the role of steroid hormones on non-sexual behaviors, in this case learning and memory in rats. Her work on the role of hormones and reproductive behavior in both rats and macaques throughout the 1930s and early 1940s constituted fundamental contributions to the field. Beach once commented at a meeting that if a conference on reproductive behavior had been held in the 1930s, it would have three participants: W.C. Young, Josephine Ball, and himself. Beach also considered Ball a friend.

The worm intercepts food particles being drawn into the mollusc by its feeding current. Taxonomy This species was first described in 1993 by the Russian marine biologist Vasily I. Radashevsky, who placed it in the genus Polydora and gave it the specific epithet \\"glycymerica\\" because of its commensal relationship with the bivalve Glycymeris yessoensis. The new species resembled Polydora vulgaris, a worm from the South China Sea that is also associated with bivalve molluscs, although in this instance, Pinctada margaritifera and Hyotissa hyotis are the hosts. Researchers used starch gel electrophoresis to compare the number of isozyme loci and the allozymic variation present in both species, and the results suggest that the two are valid, separate species. Description This worm grows to a length of about for a 250 segment worm, and is a greenish- brown colour. The prostomium has an incision that is bent down at the front, but no eyes are present in adult worms. The fifth body segment is larger than its neighbours and the seventh has a pair of white, glandular spots ventrally. There are palps on the first eight segments. Distribution and habitat Polydora glycymerica is found in the Sea of Japan where it lives commensally on the seabed, boring into the shells of bivalve molluscs such as Glycymeris yessoensis. Ecology Polydora glycymerica is an obligate commensal of a bivalve mollusc, boring into its shell. It is nearly always associated with Glycymeris yessoensis, but has also been found living in association with the ark clam Anadara broughtonii. Sometimes several worms occupy one host, with up to six per valve, and a maximum of eight per mollusc. The burrows made by the worms are \\"U\\"-shaped and are located near the posterior end of the mollusc shell, close to the siphons. The worm extends its anterior end from the burrow, intercepting food particles in the feeding current created by the mollusc. The boring activities of the worm may weaken the mollusc shell, perhaps making it more vulnerable to damage or predation. However the worm may also be of benefit to the mollusc as it may be able to handle particles that are too large for the mollusc to deal with, thus preventing the inflow siphon of the mollusc from getting clogged.

Research  When he died, The Daily Telegraph called Howkins a \\"leading\\" historian of English rural society, especially farm labourers, the rural poor and rural folklore of the 19th and early 20th centuries. Influenced by History Workshop, Howkins' research emphasised the long history of class conflict in the countryside and he explored the emergence of a distinctive class culture among the rural working class. But he was also keen to demonstrate the changing nature of rural England, as it became a place of leisure in the 20th century, and as it was influenced by the mechanisation of agriculture and environmental concerns. = Books = * Poor Labouring Men: Rural Radicalism in Norfolk, 1872‚Äì1923 (Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1985). * Reshaping Rural England: A Social History, 1850‚Äì1925 (Harper Collins, 1991). * The Death of Rural England: A Social History of the Countryside since 1900 (Routledge, 2003).

Despite clear regional differences, this cuisine has been characterised throughout the entire Alpine region for centuries by the isolated rural life on the alpine huts and in the mountain villages. The staple foods that are still available today include milk and dairy products, cereals and desserts, as well as meat preserved by drying and smoking.Alpenk√ºche: K√∂stlichkeiten aus der Bergwelt - alpen-guide.de.  Typical food and beverages  Mountain cheese \\"Milfina\\" = Dairy and cheese products = Milk and dairy products have been a central component of Alpine cuisine for centuries. The typical alpine farming with alpine-specific dual- purpose breeds such as the Simmentaler Fleckvieh (Simmental cattle) or the Tiroler Grauvieh (Tyrol Grey) can be traced back to the beginning of our era: Even the Roman writers Pliny and Strabo reported on the good milk productivity of Alpine cattle (\\"bos alpinus\\"). Various Bergk√§se varieties from the Alpine region (\\"caseus helveticus\\") are also said to have been mentioned by Pliny. In his work Naturalis historia, however, he describes cheese from the Gallic provinces as rather unpopular in Rome and compares the strong taste with that of medicine. In the meantime, cheese production in Switzerland and other Alpine countries has developed considerably: cow's milk cheeses such as Swiss Emmentaler, Allg√§uer Bergk√§se and French Tomme de Savoie, as well as various soft and hard cheeses made from goat's milk are now internationally known and popular. = Bacon, sausage and dried meat = \\"S√ºdtiroler Speck\\" Over the centuries, the widespread use of alpine farming and the need to store meat over the long winter season have brought about a number of long-lasting meat specialities in Alpine cuisine. Many products such as Tyrolean (\\"Tiroler Speck\\") und South Tyrolean bacon (\\"S√ºdtiroler Speck\\"), B√ºndnerfleisch and Valais dried meat are now protected as protected designations of origin (\\"g.g.A.\\"). But other dried meat products such as Kaminwurze also have a firm place in alpine cuisine. = Bread, pasta and desserts = Schlutzkrapfen The physically hard work of the mountain shepherds and farmers on the mountain huts requires a lot of energy even until today, which can be obtained particularly well from carbohydrate-rich food and side dishes. In addition to well-known dishes such as roll, semolina or Kaiserschmarrn or B√ºndner barley soup made from typical European cereals such as rye, barley and wheat, robust and undemanding buckwheat also had a firm place in the Alpine cuisine early on. Sciatt, a buckwheat flat bread, and Pizzoccheri (buckwheat noodles) are among the specialities of Veltlin, and in the Slovenian Oberkrain ≈Ωganci (equivalent to the Austrian Heidensterz) is a typical poor people's meal made from buckwheat flour. With the introduction of maize in Europe, it also gained in importance in Alpine cuisine and today is mainly found in the form of maize semolina in dishes such as polenta or Riebel. The typical dishes of the Alpine region also include many variations of baked goods, preferably long-lasting varieties such as the South Tyrolean Sch√ºttelbrot or the Vinschgauer. Particularly in winter, breads and cakes are prepared with dried fruit such as Kletzen - for example Kletzen bread, which is widespread in Austria and South Tyrol, or Swiss specialities such as Birnbrot and Schlorzifladen. In poor mountain regions, these recipes were often created out of the necessity to stretch expensive bread cereals from the lowlands with dried fruits.B√ºndner Birnbrot / Paun cun paira Patrimoine culinaire. In addition to the specialities already mentioned, the following dishes are also part of the traditional Alpine cuisine: * Buchteln * Germkn√∂del * Kartoffelpaunzen * Kaspresskn√∂del * Schlutz- and Schlipfkrapfen * Sp√§tzle = Wine and spirits = Due to the climatically convenient location, especially the southern Alpine regions became well known as winegrowing regions. The winegrowing in South Tyrol has a long tradition which can be traced back to pre-Roman times. Wines from the French and Austrian mountain regions have also been known and popular internationally for a long time. Other specialities of the Alps include the Swiss Ch√®vre, the Austrian Zirbenlik√∂r and the Enzianschnaps, of which the knowledge of the locations, harvesting and processing of the roots in the Tyrolean Paznaun was recognised by UNESCO as an intangible cultural heritage in 2013.  Regional cuisine  Due to the large geographical size, the climatic differences and the sparse infrastructure, Alpine cuisine has always been strongly influenced by the local cuisine of the respective countries. For example, sweet chestnuts, which are widely used in French and Italian Alpine cuisine, play only a minor role in the cuisine of the Bavarian and Austrian Alps, while, conversely, Sauerkraut, which is popular in Bavarian cuisine, is not widely used in southern Alpine regions such as Tyrol and South Tyrol. In addition to the spatial separation, the widespread cultivation of traditions also contributes to the preservation of traditional regional Alpine cuisine. For example, the Association Culinary Heritage of Switzerland, founded in 2004, was able to set up an online Encyclopedia with over 400 Swiss cuisine products, supported by the Federal Office for Agriculture and the Swiss cantons.Patrimoine culinaire: √úber uns.

History On June 21, 1961, Jos√© Manuel Acosta Casta√±eda applied for a television station on channel 2. In December 1964, the Secretariat of Communications and Transportation announced it would grant the application. The station would transmit from the Cerro de las Noas southwest of Torre√≥n with a height above average terrain of 187 meters.\\"NOTIFICACION relativa a la solicitud del C.

XHIA was Torre√≥n's second television station, broadcasting with 2,000 watts. When Casta√±eda got involved in the creation of the Tele-Cadena Mexicana network, XHIA became part of it and was one of its several stations affiliated to Televisi√≥n Independiente de M√©xico.Efra√≠n P√©rez Espino, \\"El monopolio de la televisi√≥n comercial en M√©xico (El caso Televisa)\\". Revista Mexicana de Sociolog√≠a 41.4 (Oct‚ÄìDec 1979): 1435‚Äì68. In 1973, Televisi√≥n Independiente de M√©xico and Telesistema Mexicano merged to form Televisa. For a time, XHIA continued to provide local programs in the early afternoon as well as network shows from \\"Ocho Color\\", but by early 1975, XHIA's primary program source had been changed to Canal 5.XHIA schedules from the early-mid 1970s printed in the El Siglo de Torre√≥n newspaper In November 1975, the stations of Tele-Cadena Mexicana were expropriated by the Mexican government after TCM collapsed. The station allocations were put up for bidding, and in most areas Corporaci√≥n Mexicana de Radio y Televisi√≥n or Tele-Radio Nacional, two state-owned enterprises, won the concessions and maintained most of the stations as repeaters of the Canal 13 network (today Azteca Uno). Immediately, XHIA dropped its Televisa programming and replaced it with Canal 13. However, preparations were already underway for a full-time Canal 13 repeater, which would be one of the most powerful in the country, when XHIA was forced to change networks. There were several major exceptions to the process of conversion to Canal 13, however; XHBL channel 13 Culiac√°n remained on the air for some time with unknown programming, XHST-TV in M√©rida remained under SOMEX operation for years until the state government of Yucat√°n bought it in 1981,\\"La historia de XHST-TV\\", 2005 and Jos√© Manuel Acosta Casta√±eda maintained XHIA, XHJMA-TV channel 3 in Parral, and XHCG-TV channel 12 in Los Mochis as independents. He made attempts to win television station concessions‚Äîincluding some of the ones he had lost‚Äîbut he did not meet with success. After the November 1975, notice that revoked Acosta Casta√±eda's stations, an official call for bids was put out in November 1976, for a new station on channel 2 in Torre√≥n, which would have held the callsign XHHT-TV.\\"ACUERDO que se declara susceptible de explotaci√≥n comercial el Canal 2 - (plano) de Televisi√≥n en Torre√≥n, Coah.\\", Diario Oficial de la Federaci√≥n 25 November 1976 However, this never happened, and by the late 1970s it was listed as being a Tele-Cadena Mexicana station outside of the Canal 13 network, operated with the help of SOMER (Sociedad Mexicana de Radio). This status only applied to XHIA, XHJMA and XHCG. For the next 20 years, XHIA remained on the air as an independent station, though it offered fewer hours of programming than the other stations in the Comarca Lagunera. On one Wednesday in 1986, for instance, the two Televisa stations went on the air in the morning and Canal 13 near midday, but XHIA did not begin programming until 6pm.\\"Programaci√≥n de TV para Hoy\\", El Siglo de Torre√≥n 29 January 1986 By May 8, 1997, when the station celebrated 30 years of broadcasting, XHIA had significantly expanded its local programming. It signed on with a local show known as Amanecer Lagunero, with telenovelas through the day and news and talk programming in the evenings. A week later, however, the station went off the air as 11 unionized employees began a strike that would last two and a half years. The strikers claimed violations of their collective contract, including unjustified firings and failure to make mandated contributions. The station remained off the air until December 20, 1999, when with the strike resolved, it resumed broadcasting much the same programming;\\"Canal 2 de Televisi√≥n, Torre√≥n Informa:\\" ad, El Siglo de Torre√≥n, 25 December 1999 however, in that time, it had lost its coverage on the Torre√≥n cable system, and promotions for XHIA's discussion shows emphasized that it was not on cable. After a 2004, expiration of their concessions, concerns about the continued legality of the Acosta Casta√±eda stations arose, and they would each disappear after being raided by federal authorities. For XHIA, that raid would come on August 24, 2006, when federal authorities seized the station, by now exclusively broadcasting from a studio at its mountaintop site, and took it off the air.

The church was discovered and excavated in 1978, during works on the local free-air market. The excavations revealed the foundations of a mid-6th-century church, dedicated to St. Achillios according to surviving inscriptions. Achillios had lived in the early 4th century and been the city's metropolitan bishop for 35 years. The structure is located on the top of the Frourio Hill, the city's acropolis, between the First Ancient Theatre and the later, Ottoman-era Bedesten. It is a typical three-aisled basilica with a narthex and exonarthex. Originally it was covered by a wooden roof. Various graves have been excavated in and around the church, including three vaulted tombs and a number of box-like graves. A vaulted tomb on the eastern end of the northern aisle, decorated with crosses, may be the grave of St. Achillios. As the cathedral of the Metropolis of Larissa, the church was repaired in the middle Byzantine period, when it became the centre of a large cemetery stretching to the east. Excavations have revealed a number of outbuildings erected during this period, probably used as storehouses, baths, charitable institutions, etc. The church is attested until the middle of the 14th century, and was probably demolished when the Ottomans built the Bedesten in the late 15th century.

Biography  Giovanni Francesco Loredan was in Venice son of Lorenzo Loredan and Leonora Bold√π. When both of his parents died while he was very young, he was raised by his uncle Antonio Bold√π and had as his teacher Antonio Colluraffi, repeatedly mentioned in the publications of the Accademia degli IncognitiM. Miato, L'Accademia degli Incogniti di Giovan Francesco Loredan. Venezia (1630-1661), Firenze 1998. He divided his youth between hard study and an extravagant lifestyle. He attended the classes of renowned Aristotelian philosopher Cesare Cremoni in Padua and began, before 1623, to gather around him that group of scholars who then formed the Accademia degli Incogniti. As founder of the Accademia degli Incogniti and a member of many other Academies, he had close contact with almost all the scholars of his time. He and his circle played a decisive role in the creation of modern opera*Rosand, Ellen, Opera in Seventeenth-Century Venice: the Creation of a Genre. University of California Press, 2007 In addition to literary activity, he also took part in public affairs. At twenty he was recorded in the golden book, but his career began quite late: in September 1632 he was elected 'Savio agli Ordini' and in 1635 he was Treasurer of the fortress of Palmanova. On his return he reorganized the Accademia degli Incogniti (1636) and, in 1638, despite attempts to avoid it, he was obliged, as the only descendant of his branch, to contract marriage with Laura Valier.G. Brunacci, Vita di Giovan Francesco Loredan, Venezia 1662. He was then Provveditore ai Banchi (1640), 'Provveditore alle Pompe' (1642), and in 1648 he made the leap to the rank of avogador del comun that he held several times (1651, 1656 and 1657) and 'Provveditore alle Biave'(1653). He subsequently joined the offices of the State Inquisitor and became a member of the Council of Ten. In 1656 he entered the Minor Consiglio, that is, among the six patricians who, together with the doge, composed the Serenissima Signoria. However, he may then have been pushed out of office, as in the following years he no longer held important positions. In 1660 he was a Provveditore in Peschiera. The following year (13 August 1661) he died.  Works  In addition to the Scherzi Geniali (Sarzina, Venice, 1632) he wrote novels that were reprinted numerous times and also translated into French, such as La Dianea (Venice, Sarzina, 1635) and L'Adamo (Venice, Sarzina, 1640), operettas of religious subjects, as Sensi di devozione sui Sette, (Venice, Guerigli, 1652); Life of Alexander the Pope, (Venice, Sarzina, 1637); Life of St. John the Bishop of Trogir, (Venice, Guerigli, 1648); I gradi dell'anima, (Venezia, Guerigli, 1652), collections of academic essays (Bizzarrie accademiche, Venezia, Guerigli, 1655), Sei dubi amorosi (ivi, Sarzina, 1632); Il cimiterio; epitafi giocosi (together with Pietro Michiel, Tivoli, Mancini 1646), a comic Iliad (Venice, 1654), historical compilations Ribellione e morte del Valestain, under the pseudonym of Gnaeo Falcidio Donaloro, Milan, Ghisolfi, 1634 which cost him a warning by the Inquisitors of State, Istoria de 're Lusignani, with the pseudonym of Enrico Giblet, Bologna, Monti, 1647), a Vita del Marino (Venice, Sarzina, 1633), a collection of Letters still under the pseudonym of E Giblet (Venice, Guerigli, 1653). As founder of the Accademia degli Incogniti he edited the publications of the collective works of the Academy:Cento Novelle, Venezia, Guerigli, 1651; Discorsi accademici, Venezia Sarzina, 1635; Le glorie degli incogniti, Venezia, Valvasense, 1647; Novelle amorose, Venezia, eredi del Sarzina, 1641.A.

(1998). Life history of the oak borer, Platypus quercivorus (Murayama) (Coleoptera : Platypodidae). Applied Entomology and Zoology 33: 67-75. This species is most commonly known for vectoring the fungus responsible for excessive oak dieback in Japan since the 1980s.Kamata, N., Esaki, K., Kato, K., Igeta, Y., Wada, K. (2002). Potential impact of global warming on deciduous oak dieback caused by ambrosia fungus Raffaelea sp carried by ambrosia beetle Platypus quercivorus (Coleoptera : Platypodidae) in Japan. Bulletin of Entomological Research 92: 119-126. It is found in Japan, India, Indonesia, New Guinea, and Taiwan. Description  Since P. quercivorus belongs to the Platypodinae, it has distinct clubs on the end of its stout antennae with three solid segments.Benzel, J. (2015). Screening aid: Ambrosia beetles, Platypus quercivorus (Murayama), Megaplatypus mutatus (Chapuis). Identification Technology Program (ITP), USDA-APHIS-PPQ-S&T;, Fort Collins, CO. 7 pp. Usually, the beetle is between 4 and 5 mm long, reddish-brown in colour, and is elongate and roughly cylindrical. The prothorax is as wide as the head. Males have a shallow, unarmed plate on the underside of the thorax and a convex and downward slope of their elytra. The elytra have a broad square end and spines at the top. Females have a mycangium on the pronotum for carrying symbiotic fungi spores.Esaki, K., Kato, K., Kamata, N. (2004). Stand-level distribution and movement of Platypus quercivorus adults and patterns of incidence of new infestation. Agricultural and Forest Entomology 6: 71-82. Although this trait may be in both females and males, it is always in females and rarely in males.  Habitat  Although well known in Japan, this species also lives in India, Indonesia, New Guinea and Taiwan.Kobayashi, M., Ueda, A. (2002). Preliminary study of mate choice in Platypus quercivorus (Murayama) (Coleoptera : Platypodidae). Applied Entomology and Zoology 37: 451-457. Trees to inhabit are often selected for based on olfactory and visual cues.Yamasaki, M., Futai, K. (2012). Discrimination among host tree species by the ambrosia beetle Platypus quercivorus. Journal of Forest Research 17: 149-155. Infestation of these habitats occurs in stages beginning with males flying to and landing on a tree and then boring into the bark through the stems. Typically, this species aggregates in areas with clusters of similar, suitable trees to increase infestation efficiency. This may be due to coevolutionary factors with tree species Quercus crispula as it is most suitable for gallery formation and is distributed in a clumped pattern.Yamasaki, M., Sakimoto, M. (2009). Predicting oak tree mortality caused by the ambrosia beetle Platypus quercivorus in a cool-temperate forest. Journal of Applied Entomology 133: 673-681. This allows for an increased chance of more abundant, successful galleries. Trees are also selected for more often with increasing diameter at breast height (DBH). This allows for more room for gallery formation, which are often located in lower trunks of oak trees.Kuroda, K. (2001). Responses of Quercus sapwood to infection with the pathogenic fungus of new wilt disease vectored by the ambrosia beetle Platypus quercivorus. Journal of Wood Science 47: 425-429. Males of this species are attracted to soaked logs over dry logs.Kitajima, H., Goto, H. (2004). Rearing technique for the oak platypodid beetle, Platypus quercivorus (Murayama) (Coleoptera : Platypodidae), on soaked logs of deciduous oak tree, Quercus serrata Thunb. Ex Murray. Applied Entomology and Zoology 39: 7-13. The anaerobic conditions of the submerged logs increases the likelihood of a male choosing those logs to create a gallery. This may occur because those conditions favour the growth of the beetle's fungi symbionts. There is a preference for edge habitats over deep forest interiors.Igeta, Y., Esaki, K., Kato, K., Kamata, K. (2003). Influence of light condition on the stand-level distribution and movement of the ambrosia beetle Platypus quercivorus (Coleoptera : Platypodidae). Applied entomology and Zoology 38: 167-175. Roadsides and other edges act as attractions for the beetle. This attraction may be due to an increased light presence as the species is positively phototactic. This beetle prefers habitats with the highest light intensity when offered varying intensities. It has been suggested that the 0.4ÀöC increase in average temperature compared to the last 100 years in Japan is responsible for the increased range of the beetle and oak dieback. The warmer climate has allowed the beetle to move north, encountering its best suited host, Q. crispula. It is proposed that as the climate increases, more overlap between the beetle and the best suited host will occur, resulting in an even stronger oak dieback epidemic.  Reproduction = Mate choice = Due to the monogamous nature of the oak ambrosia beetle, mate selection is vital for both females and males. It is in the male's best interest to select a mate capable of excavating the gallery, planting nourishing fungi for larvae, oviposition, and bringing frass to the male for removal. For females, selecting a male that has bored into a tree with sufficient resources is important to increase fecundity. Mating is male- initiated. Males will bore a cylindrical entrance tunnel during late spring to early summer, meet the female there, and mate at the entrance hole. The male will enter the gallery first, followed by the female. Then, both back out of the gallery, changing positions so that the female will enter first for the second entrance, and enter again. They will then both back out until the female's abdomen is exposed and copulation will begin. It is suggested that female mate choice occurs between the first and second entrance because she is then able to view the gallery whereas male mate choice occurs at the beginning of the process when he decides whether or not to let the female enter the tunnel he bored. Once both the male and female have chosen to proceed with reproduction, males make signals to prevent other females from entering the gallery. = Parental Care = Each pairing will create one gallery with vertical and lateral branches and die in it together.Kinuura, H., Kobayashi, M. (2006). Death of Quercus crispula by inoculation with adult Platypus quercivorus (Coleoptera : Platypodidae). Applied Entomology and Zoology 41: 123-12. The female will deposit eggs at the tunnel's ends two to three weeks following gallery completion. This must be done in trees that have not been previously infested by other P. quercivorus. The male will then create a barricade at the gallery's entrance with his body. Here, he waits for the female to bring frass and bored dust which the male will then discard outside. This species has a high reproduction rate, which in addition to low brood mortality resulting from cooperative parental care, may contribute to the high reproductive success of this species. Reproductive success is shown to be higher in logs than in living trees. Galleries in living trees lowers reproductive success of the oak ambrosia beetle because the tree's defensive mechanism of sap secretion enters galleries and kills individuals. Tree species Q. crispula is the most suitable host species for reproducing and rearing offspring. = Growth and development = Eggs hatch in about a week. The larvae then graze on the symbiotic fungi covering the gallery walls and pass through five instars. Adults emerge from their mother galleries 2‚Äì4 hours following dawn due to their diurnal tendencies. Approximately 40% of broods reach adulthood by late summer to early fall. After reaching adulthood, individuals usually leave their galleries but some remain in their maternal galleries. The remaining 60% of broods will reach the fifth larval stage by mid fall and overwinter in pupal chambers. These individuals emerge as adults in late spring to early summer. This brooding technique is partially bivoltine because approximately 40% of each population takes one year to complete a life cycles whereas the other 60% may have two generations in a year. Individuals that remain in maternal galleries are often shown to not reproduce but rather, clean the galleries, which presents the possibility that this species may have eusocial tendencies. It is assumed that parents die either before or during winter.  Interspecific relationships  P. quercivorus has symbiotic relationships with fungi and oak trees.Endoh, R., Suzuki, M., Okada, G., Takeuchi, Y., Futai, K. (2011). Fungus Symbionts Colonizing the Galleries of the Ambrosia Beetle Platypus quercivorus. Microbial Ecology 62: 106-120. = Symbiotic relationship with fungi = P. quercivorus acts as the primary vector for the parthenogenic fungus Raffaelea quercivora, which causes Japanese Oak Wilt disease. The oak ambrosia beetle bores into sapwood and heartwood of host oaks commonly including Q. crispula and Quercus serrata. Once infected, these trees wilt and die, paralleling the effects of Dutch elm disease. The oak ambrosia beetle carries not only the pathogen itself, but also dietary fungus symbionts in mycangia. Once galleries are constructed by the beetle in the sapwood of a host tree, the released fungi disseminate in yeast-like microbes and grow on the gallery walls. P. quercivorus larvae then hatch and feed on the growing fungi. In addition to R. quercivora, P. quercivorus has at least one other main symbiont, Candida kashinagacola, as these two fungi species are found in all tree host types selected for by the beetle. The latter fungus species, however, has not been linked to any parasitic tree diseases. In both relationships, the beetle receives a food source and the fungus receives transport into its final host. = Predatory relationships with oak trees = By acting as a vector for R. quercivora, the oak ambrosia beetle has killed trees since the 1980s. This species attacks all trees and logs but prefers debilitated trees and fresh logs for rearing offspring. Typically, infestation rates are high, possibly to efficiently utilize sparse resources. Working together with the fungi they vector, the ambrosia beetle galleries disrupt the flow of water within trees, leading to necrosis within 2‚Äì3 months of the attack. Mass attacks of the beetle are necessary to overcome defense mechanisms of trees. Often, P. quercivorus attacks trees from the family Fagaceae but is known to attack 45 different woody plant species from 27 genera in 17 families. Infestation occurs in stages. First, trees surrounding previously infested trees are infested early in the season. Then, major infestation occurs from the epicentre formed at the upper forest margin or at a forest edge, which then spreads downward into the remaining forest.  Dispersal  These individuals spread through long- distance dispersal and diffusion. Endemic populations are limited to weakened, old, and highly stressed tree populations but will attack healthy trees once local P. quercivorus populations reach an overcrowded threshold. Infestation happens quickly and parallels invasive species with no regulating factors. This species may grow in population size and numbers in sudden outbreaks. These sudden outbreaks may be due to climatic and biological factors that cause host trees to reduce the amount of sap they secrete through parasite- induced necrosis, which is their main defense mechanism to control P. quercivorus populations. Additionally, habitats with an abundance of suitable host plants may encourage population outbreaks. Populations form through the use of pheromones released by members of the species in order to attract more individuals to overcome the tree's defenses. From analyzing interception trap results, oak ambrosia beetles are known to move upwards along slopes. Typically, adult movement is influenced by environmental factors such as light, wind, and gravity. It is thought that upward movement of wind majorly influences P. quercivorus movement. Additionally, oak ambrosia beetles have positive phototaxis and fly more near forest edges. Adults tend to concentrate near upper edges of forests and have a gradient population along slopes. This species is labelled as an edge species due to its preference for edge habitat.  Control techniques  Although not yet implemented, researchers suggest that protecting frequently attacked trees is important. One way to do this is by binding the trunks with vinyl sheets which will prevent the beetle from boring into trees and transmitting the fungus. Researchers understand that not all trees should be protected but those with a high probability of being attacked should be. Trees from the family Fagaceae that have a larger DBH, are in clumps, and are on edges near excess light should be included in the protection plan.

Lisowicia is the largest known dicynodont, as well as the largest non-mammalian synapsid, and is estimated to have weighed between 5‚Äì6 tons, comparable in size to modern elephants. It was also one of the last dicynodonts, living shortly before their extinction at the end of the Triassic period. Fossils of a giant dicynodont were known from Poland since 2008, but Lisowicia was not named and officially described as a new species for another decade in late 2018. Lisowicia is unique amongst dicynodonts for its erect posture with all four limbs held upright directly under its body. This is similar to the limbs of living mammals and dinosaurs, but unlike the sprawling and semi-erect postures typical of all other dicynodonts (and indeed all other non-mammalian synapsids), and shares many independently evolved features of its limbs with large mammals. Lisowicia was the largest animal in its environment, and was comparable in size and ecology to the herbivorous \\"prosauropod\\" sauropodomorphs, which otherwise occupied the role of large high-browsing herbivores in most Late Triassic ecosystems. Prior to the discovery of Lisowicia, dicynodonts were suggested to have been out-competed by sauropodomorphs and were incapable of achieving similarly large body sizes. Lisowicia may have evolved its large size in response to the absence of sauropodomorphs in its ecosystem in southern Poland, or alternatively may have acted as a direct competitor to them. Description Life restoration with hypothetical skin covering Although very large for a dicynodont, Lisowicia still closely resembles other Triassic stahleckeriids, such as its close relative Placerias from North America. It was a heavily built quadruped with a rotund, barrel shaped body, a large head with beaked jaws and a short neck, stocky limbs, and a very short tail. The skull is incomplete and known only from various isolated individual pieces, but they are enough to determine that it had a similar skull to other stahleckeriids. The temporal fenestra were large, and the back of the skull was drawn into a high crest between them, providing extensive jaw muscle attachment at the back of the skull. The snout was relatively elongate like in other stahleckeriids, and had a toothless tortoise-like beak at the front. Like some other Triassic dicynodonts, Lisowicia was completely toothless and lacked even the tusks typical of most dicynodonts. Instead, it had a pair of short and thick triangular projections from the maxillary jaw bone behind the beak called caniniform processes, similar to those of the related Ischigualastia and other stahleckeriids. Likewise, comparing the proportions of the quadrate bone at the back of the skull to those of Ischigualastia suggests that Lisowicia had a broad skull that was roughly wide between each quadrate at the jaw joints. Its backbone and ribs are typical for dicynodonts, however, the cervical vertebrae of the neck are notable for having unusual hollows excavated into their sides. This is similar to the holes in some dinosaur vertebrae that are associated with a system of air sacs and a bird-like respiratory system. However, unlike dinosaurs Lisowicia lacks openings in its vertebrae (pleurocoels) for air sacs and the interior of the vertebra is solid. This trait is unique to Lisowicia amongst dicynodonts, and its function is unclear. The bones of the pelvis and hind limb are very robust compared to other dicynodonts due to the massive size of the animal (e.g. the largest known femur is long), but are otherwise similar to those of other stahleckeriids. Like other stahleckeriids, the hind legs were also held upright beneath the body. =Forelimbs= The forelimbs of Lisowicia are very distinctive amongst dicynodonts. Indeed, their construction is unique to not only the group, but to non-mammalian synapsids as a whole and shares features with the limbs of mammals and dinosaurs. The forelimbs of Lisowicia are held completely erect under the body, with an elbow joint that is directed backwards and so only allows the forearm to swing forwards and backwards in a parasagittal gait. This arrangement is found in the hindlimbs of various other large Triassic kannemeyeriiforms, but they all retain sprawling forelimbs with elbows bowed outwards and joints that allow the radius and ulna to rotate during each step in a sprawled posture. To achieve this posture, the forelimbs of Lisowicia had to undergo several prominent anatomical changes compared to the normal condition in dicynodonts. On the humerus, the shoulder joint and the elbow are parallel to each other, unlike the rotated humerus of sprawling dicynodonts, and so the humerus is held upright beneath the shoulder and directly above the radius and the ulna. The forearm itself is also unusually short compared to other dicynodonts since the elbow is now positioned further down directly below the body and closer to the ground. The musculature of the forelimb has also been rearranged to facilitate its upright posture and gait, now functioning to draw the limb forwards and backwards and losing the ability to rotate the upper arm as it would in a sprawling stride. =Size= Size of Lisowicia compared to a human Although the skeleton is incomplete, the massive size of various elements of its skeleton indicate that Lisowicia was a very large animal, larger than any other dicynodont. From comparing its bones to other dicynodonts, its body length was estimated to be around long and with a hip height of over . Its body weight was initially calculated to be approximately 9.33 tons from the circumference of its femur and humerus‚Äîa proxy for estimating how much weight the limbs needed to support. However, the shafts of these bones are disproportionately robust and thick in Lisowicia, even for its size, and so its body weight was likely overestimated. Its body weight was later more reliably estimated by modelling its mass from the estimated total volume of its body. These estimates varied depending on the girth of its rib cage and the amount of soft tissue modelled around the skeleton, with an overall average weight of 5.87 tons, and a lowermost estimate with minimal body fat and other tissues at 4.87 tons and a maximum of 7.02 tons at its bulkiest. This range is comparable to those of modern African elephants, comfortably making Lisowicia the largest known non-mammalian synapsid and the biggest synapsid prior to the appearance of large mammals in the Eocene (such as the brontotheres). By comparison, the large dinocephalian Tapinocaninus was similarly estimated to weigh only on average. History of discovery Map of the Lisowice site Remains of Lisowicia have been discovered in the Lipie ≈ölƒÖskie clay pit in Lisowice, a village in southern Poland near the town of Lubliniec, Silesia. The fossil bearing beds of Lipie ≈ölƒÖskie consist mostly of green mudstones. The age of the Lipie ≈ölƒÖskie clay pit has been difficult to determine, with different biostratigraphic methods of dating providing varying results. The site has typically been dated to the Rhaetian, which would make Lisowicia one of the youngest dicynodonts in the world. However, palaeontologists Grzegorz Racki and Spencer Lucas have claimed the site to be older and dated to the middle Norian stage based on biostratigraphy of large vertebrates, including Lisowicia. They instead suggested Lisowicia was not significantly younger than other dicynodonts and was similar in age to the last known genera elsewhere in the world. A sample of detrital zircons from the Lipie ≈ölƒÖskie clay pit was radiometrically dated to determine the maximum age of deposition for the fossil beds. The youngest zircon grain recorded an age of approximately 211 ¬± 3 million years old in the late Norian, however due to the discrepancy between the formation of the zircon crystals and deposition as sediment it is likely that Lipie ≈ölƒÖskie is younger than this, corroborating the late Norian to early Rhaetian estimates. Outdated skeletal reconstruction based on the original 2008 interpretation of the skeleton Remains of Lisowicia were first discovered in 2006 by palaeontologists Jerzy Dzik, Tomasz Sulej and Grzegorz Nied≈∫wiedzki, who initially mistook them for the bones of a sauropodomorph dinosaur due to their massive size. They later recognised the fossils as those of a giant dicynodont in 2008, by then known from a partially articulated skeleton and various isolated bones from at least two individuals. Between 2007‚Äî2014, over 1000 bones of Lisowicia were collected from the clay pit. Lisowicia would not be officially named and published as a new taxon until January of 2019, although the name and the description were released online in November 2018 prior to the official publication date. The genus is named after the village Lisowice where the original specimens were found, while the specific name bojani honours Ludwig Heinrich Bojanus (1776‚Äì1827), a German physician and naturalist who did pioneering work in comparative anatomy and paleontology. The known fossils of Lisowicia are held in the collections of the Institute of Paleobiology at the Polish Academy of Sciences and the Department of Paleobiology and Evolution at the University of Warsaw, Poland. More remains of a giant Polish dicynodont were discovered near the town of Wo≈∫niki in 2007 and later reported on in 2010. These remains had been regarded as belonging to the same taxon as the Lipie ≈ölƒÖskie dicynodont, although they were not explicitly referred to Lisowicia when it was described in 2019, and their affinity is thus unclear. Classification Lisowicia is a kannemeyeriiform, the group to which most Triassic dicynodonts belong to, and is a member of the family Stahleckeriidae, the last remaining lineage of dicynodonts in the Late Triassic. In particular, phylogenetic analyses by Sulej & Nied≈∫wiedzki (2019) using two separate datasets both found Lisowicia to be closely related to the well-known North American genus Placerias in the subfamily Placeriinae, together with the Moroccan Moghreberia. A simplified cladogram from one of the analysis focused on the relationships of Stahleckeriidae is reproduced below: =Dicynodont gigantism and evolution= Mounted fossil humerus of Lisowicia Prior to the discovery of Lisowicia, the evolution of giant body sizes in Triassic sauropodomorphs was thought to be an exclusive trait of dinosaurs, as other large herbivores‚Äîincluding the dicynodonts‚Äîwere not thought to have achieved similar sizes. The elephantine size of Lisowicia demonstrates that gigantism also evolved in dicynodonts, and analysis of their body size as they evolved over the course of the Late Triassic demonstrates that, like sauropodomorphs, Triassic dicynodonts were also increasing in body size, culminating in Lisowicia. In fact, dicynodonts were consistently larger than sauropodomorphs during the Carnian stage, and both achieved similar gigantic sizes in the Norian to the Rhaetian with Lisowicia. The evolution of gigantism in both sauropodomorphs and Lisowicia at similar time periods suggests that ecological factors may have allowed and encouraged both lineages to grow to giant sizes, as opposed to specific traits inherent to sauropodomorph dinosaurs as had previously been suggested. The evolution of gigantism in dicynodonts was a gradual process, occurring over approximately 20 million years, and acquired major restructuring the musculo-skeletal system to achieve the size and posture of Lisowicia. It's possible that gigantism in Lisowicia was driven by increasing body size in predators, or as a metabolic adaptation for getting more nutrition out of their food by increasing the size of their gut. It also highlights that dicynodont evolution in the Late Triassic is still poorly understood. Previously considered to be geographically restricted and in decline, Lisowicia demonstrates that dicynodonts were both still geographically widespread and continuing to diversify in the Late Triassic, particularly evolving traits to support massive body sizes. Palaeobiology=Feeding and diet= Lisowicia was a herbivore, like most other dicynodonts, using its relatively long beak to crop and chew, although its large size implies it was feeding on higher levels of vegetation than was typical for the group. Coprolites attributed to Lisowicia indicate that it mostly ate soft vegetation and conifers. However, some coprolites contain large portions of woody material, a trait observed in some other dicynodont coprolites. This has been suggested to represent seasonal variation in its diet, possibly when their preferred diet of soft vegetation was out of season. =Predation= Smok (far left) with prey animals, including Lisowicia (far right), as inferred from coprolite contents and bones with bite marks Bite marks have been found on the bones of Lisowicia that match the teeth of the contemporary predatory archosaur Smok, and dicynodont bone fragments have also been identified in its proposed coprolites, implying that Lisowicia was a major component in the predator's diet. The majority of the bite marks are found on juvenile specimens of Lisowicia, and this preponderance was suggested to indicate that the juvenile Lisowicia were preferentially hunted by Smok and that they represent active predation and not just scavenged remains. =Growth= Histological studies from the limb bones of Lisowicia showed features characteristic of a rapid growth rate as juveniles, similar to other large dicynodonts. However, while the growth rate of other dicynodonts slowed down as they grew, the studied bones of Lisowicia showed no such signs of slowing their growth. The possibility that the bones belonged to juveniles with an even larger adult body size than estimated was ruled out partly on the basis of their already massive size, but also because the bones were well ossified and developmentally mature. Instead, it's more likely that Lisowicia grew very rapidly without any interruptions until reaching their adult body size, as there was no clear lines of arrested growth (LAGs) that otherwise indicate periods of slower, reduced growth. LAGs may have been truly absent, or were possibly erased by extensive remodelling of the bone into adulthood, both of which would support permanently rapid growth in Lisowicia, similar to mammals and some dinosaurs. =Latrines= Coprolites attributed to Lisowicia have been discovered in abundant accumulations in areas believed to have been around standing water. These assemblages are similar to discoveries in Brazil believed to represent communal latrines made by the dicynodont Dinodontosaurus, and it's possible that Lisowicia may have performed a similar behaviour. Communal latrines are documented in modern gregarious mammals, and supports the idea that dicynodonts like Lisowicia lived in herds and even suggests that they had complex social behaviours like modern large mammals. Palaeoecology Drawing of the vertebrate faunal assemblage of the Lisowice site Lisowicia coexisted with a broad variety of Late Triassic animals in Lipie ≈ölƒÖskie. The majority of these animals were archosaurs, including the large predatory archosaur Smok, small dinosauromorphs including a silesaurid and a Coelophysis-like neotheropod, pterosaurs, and a small crocodylomorph (previously believed to be a poposauroid). Other small reptiles include a sphenodont, an indeterminate archosauromorph and a possible choristodere. The only other synapsid known to coexist with Lisowicia was Hallautherium, a small morganucodont mammaliaform closely related to modern mammals and many orders of magnitude smaller than Lisowicia. The wet, freshwater environment supported temnospondyl amphibians (a capitosaur and smaller plagiosaurid) as well as an abundance of fish including lungfish, coelacanths and hybodontid sharks. The environment at Lipie ≈ölƒÖskie was wet and swampy, comparable to the modern day everglades, with slow-moving meandering rivers and oxbow lakes, surrounded by abundant vegetation that included Cheirolepidiaceae conifers and ginkgoales, seed ferns such as Lepidopteris and the cycads Androstrobus and Beania. By contrast, neighbouring environments may have been dry and arid, suggested by remains of the possibly xerophytic conifer Hirmeriella and charcoal fragments from fires being transported by rivers to the locality. The absence of any large sauropodomorph herbivores is curious, as they are present in many other Late Triassic ecosystems, including in nearby localities in Europe, such as Plateosaurus in Germany. It's possible that giant dicynodonts like Lisowicia competed directly with sauropodomorphs, however it was also possible that their absence was unrelated, and instead Lisowicia grew to its massive size to fill the ecological role of large browsing herbivores otherwise occupied by sauropodomorphs in other ecosystems.

Biography Bergh was born in Stockholm, Sweden. He was the son of Severin Bergh and Emma Forsstr√∂m. His parents were shopkeepers. He attended Maria L√¶romsskola then in 1844 went to Uppsala University. He initially studied the natural sciences, but switched to legal studies and graduated with a master's degree in 1849. At first, he worked as a notary at the Svea Court of Appeal and Stockholm City Hall. His interest in art began during a trip to Gotland, where he met several artists and became friends with the architect, Fredrik Wilhelm Scholander. When he got home, he contacted Johan Way (1792-1873), an instructor at his alma mater, who numbered painting among his many accomplishments. After that, he increasingly devoted less time to the law and more to art. His first attempt to enroll at the Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts was rejected, but he was not discouraged. He began exhibiting under the auspices of the Swedish Art Association (Sveriges allm√§nna konstf√∂rening). One of those exhibitions was attended by Count Mikael Gustaf Anckarsv√§rd (1792-1878) who was an official at the Royal Academy. He was impressed with Bergh's work and assured him that a new application would be accepted. By 1854, he had qualified for a scholarship that enabled him to take a three-year study trip. He visited Switzerland, Italy and Germany where he studied at the Kunstakademie D√ºsseldorf with Norwegian romanticist painter Hans Gude. He also had some lessons from German landscape and seascape painter Andreas Achenbach and the Swiss landscape painter, Alexandre Calame. In 1857, he established a landscape painting school at the Royal Academy and became a Professor there in 1861. In the late 1860s, he moved away from the more traditional landscape subjects and began focusing on scenes from central Sweden. He was awarded a gold medal at the Exposition Universelle (1867) in Paris. In 1874, he suffered an intracranial hemorrhage and became partially paralyzed. As a result, he began repeating popular motifs and his work never returned to its original level of quality. He died during 1880 in Stockholm. Personal life In 1855, he married the artist Amanda Helander (1825-1888). They were the parents of Richard Bergh (1858-1919) who also became a painter.

The show is based on the 1966 Brazilian novel of the same name written by Jorge Amado. Production began on 22 November 2018 in Mexico City, and it stars Ana Serradilla, Sergio Mur, and Joaqu√≠n Ferreira.  Plot  Flor M√©ndez has always felt different to all the women she knows and it is that her passionate temperament and independent spirit, sometimes does not go with the limited horizons of the town where she was born. Flor's greatest passion is dancing, despite Margarita, who forbade it, since the death of Narciso, Flor's father. Margarita blames Flor for this death, although the reality is different. Flor seems resigned and works as a receptionist in the dance academy of the town, but also continues to dance, in secret. Her dream opportunity comes when she is invited to audition for a major company in Mexico City. Flor decides to pursue her dream and this causes a conflict with Margarita, which leads her to leave town. During the party of Tlaxcalixtlahuacaca, Flor dances with the group of the academy, in front of all the town. At the party Valent√≠n Hern√°ndez approaches and dances with her, the connection between both is instantaneous. Valent√≠n is a \\"Robin Hood\\" type swindler, rogue and seductive, with great sensual appeal. Valent√≠n arrives in town with his friend, El Chile. They are fleeing from Cassandra, Valent√≠n's former lover and partner. His arrival will not only disrupt Flor's life, but also of the entire town. The attraction between Flor and Valent√≠n is very strong, only that she is determined to succeed and travels to Mexico City. Valent√≠n follows her, willing to support her and she accepts it. Meanwhile, another man has been disappointed with the absence of Flor, Dr. Teodoro Hidalgo, her childhood friend, who days before, is rejected by Flor, by asking her to marry him. This causes Teodoro to decide to go to Spain to study a specialty. Flor auditions, but when she performs her test, she suffers a fall, the injury is irreversible and she is incapable of dancing professionally again. This circumstance unites her to Valent√≠n and by mutual agreement they decide to marry, in order to pay for the surgery that Flor needs. The couple starts their life in the city and the attraction becomes a deep love. Later, they return to Tlaxcalixtlahuacaca, where Flor confronts not only her family, but the entire town, for being accustomed to judging all those who act differently. Soon, Valent√≠n makes friends and enemies, such as Octavio and Samantha Mercader, owners of the casino. Valent√≠n's eagerness to give Flor everything she needs, causes him to get into trouble again, without his wife's knowledge. And when nobody expects it, Valent√≠n dies from a heart attack on a night of partying. His death is a blow for Flor and everyone in town. Only, along with the sadness, they also discover the lies of Valent√≠n. In the middle of all this, Teodoro reappears, who consoles Flor. What almost everyone ignores is that Valent√≠n, turned into a ghost, will return to try to recover Flor's love and discover that she is married to Teodoro.

The valley contains around 50 rock-hewn churches and numerous rock-cut buildings.  Development and location  The Ihlara Valley and other noteworthy sites in Cappadocia View from the entry stairs The canyon was formed in prehistoric times by the . It lies between the villages of Ihlara in the southeast and Selime in the northwest. At the north end of the village of Ihlara, there is a stairway with almost 400 steps, which descends over 100 m down into the canyon. From the 7th century AD, the valley was settled by Byzantine monks who dug their houses and churches out of the tuff stone, which had been deposited by the eruptions of Mount Hasan. The earlier Greek name, Peristrema (Œ†ŒµœÅŒπœÉœÑœÅŒ∑ŒºŒ±; winding round) of the village of Belisarma which is located about halfway along the valley from Ihlara to Selime, gave its name to the valley as well.  Churches  Facade of the S√ºmb√ºll√º Kilise Church facade The churches in the valley fall into two groups. The first consists of the churches near the village of Ihlara, which are decorated with paintings of a local Cappadocian type that show influence from Persia and Syria to the east. They mostly pre-date the Iconoclasm, but were often repainted in newer styles over time. The second group is located near the village of Belisarma and consists of churches in the Byzantine style of the tenth and eleventh centuries, known as Macedonian art. The first group includes: * Aƒüa√ßaltƒ± Kilisesi ('Church under the Tree'): a cross-in-square church cut out of the cliff, perhaps dating to the 7th century AD. The depiction of the Ascension in its cupola pre-dates the Iconoclasm. * Yƒ±lanlƒ± Kilise ('Snake Church'): another cross-in- square church with an unusually long apse. In the narthex there are scenes of Hell dating to the 9th century AD, and below them are four naked sinners in the grip of snake-like monsters - from which the church takes its modern name. * S√ºmb√ºll√º Kilise ('Hyacinth church'): possibly from the 10th century AD. The church has a T-shaped ground plan and belongs to the transition to the Macedonian style. The wall paintings include depictions of Constantine VII with his wife Helena. On the other hand, the external facade shows eastern influences. The second group includes: * Direkli Kilise ('Pillar church'). The cruciform nave church was created in the 10th century AD. The cupola is supported by four tall columns, which are decorated with portraits of saints. One of the few inscriptions in the valley reports the dedication of the church by the Byzantine emperor Basil II (r. 976-1025). * Karagedik Kilisesi ('Church with the Black Gap'): a cross-in-square church with four pillars, which was built from bricks and trachyte blocks in the 11th century and has been almost entirely destroyed aside from some faded remains of paintings. * Kƒ±rkdamaltƒ± Kilisesi ('Church with forty roofs', also called 'St George's Church'). An inscription allows the church to be dated between 1283 and 1295, which makes it the last known example of Christian architecture in the Ihlara valley until the revival of church building by the Cappadocian Greeks in the 19th century. The church's paintings include depictions of St George, a painting of the Byzantine consul Basileos Giagupes, who was also an Emir and is shown in Seljuk clothing with his wife Thamar, a Georgian princess. The aforementioned inscription mentions both the Seljuk Sultan Mesud II and the Byzantine emperor Andronikos II Palaiologos, a sign that at this date some kind of peaceful co- existence between Christians and Muslims was possible in Cappadocia. In the Niƒüde Archaeological Museum, there is a display of the mummies of a woman and four children who were entombed in the Ihlara Valley in the 10th century AD. The Aksaray Museum also has mummies from the Ihlara valley.  See also  * Rock-cut architecture of Cappadocia  Bibliography  * Peter Daners, Volker Ohl: Kappadokien.

It was published initially in The Australian on 13 December 1838, several days after seven men were found guilty of the incident but a few days before they were hanged to death. The poem is told in first-person as a mother, whose older child and husband died in the massacre, tries to quiet her baby. It was published in a variety of newspapers and books and after being set to music by Isaac Nathan, it was performed at a concert. The poem was mostly praised by newspapers, but was criticized considerably by the Sydney Herald.  Background and publication  Eliza Hamilton Dunlop moved to New South Wales, Australia in 1838, arriving on 25 February. The Myall Creek Massacre occurred on 10 June 1838, a few months after her arrival. During the incident, at least 28 Aboriginal Australians were murdered by 11 people; several Aboriginal children were decapitated and a three-year-old boy was killed. On 5 December, seven men were found guilty for the crime after a trial; the other four men who were involved with the incident were accused of the massacre but found innocent. On 18 December, the seven men found guilty of the incident were sentenced to death, executed by hanging. Dunlop's poem was first published in The Australian on 13 December 1838, about a week after the seven men were found guilty, but several days before they were hanged. Afterwards, it appeared in a number of other publications, including The Australasian Chronicle (16 October 1841), The Sydney Monitor and Commercial Advertiser (27 October 1841), The Aboriginal Mother and Other Poems (1981), The Penguin Book of Australian Ballads (1993), The Oxford Book of Australian Women's Verse (1995), Australian Verse: An Oxford Anthology (1998), An Anthology of Australian Poetry to 1920 (2007), The Puncher & Wattmann Anthology of Australian Poetry (2009), Macquarie PEN Anthology of Australian Literature (2009), and The Penguin Anthology of Australian Poetry (2009). Also, in 1891, a poem \\"Aboriginal Mother‚Äôs Lament\\" was published in The Daily Examiner. Although the title of the poem was slightly different and the author claimed to be J. C. Laycock, the text of the two poems were almost exactly the same, only having a few minor differences. In addition to these publications, a series of poems by Dunlop called \\"Songs of an Exile,\\" which contained \\"The Aboriginal Mother\\" as its fourth poem, appeared in The Australian in 1838, and 1840.  The poem  \\"The Aboriginal Mother\\" was written to express Dunlop's sorrow over the massacre and expresses sympathy for the Aboriginals of Australia. It is written from the view of a mother who managed to survive the massacre, but whose husband and older child were killed in it. Throughout the poem, she expresses her grief over how she was not able to prevent her husband's death and is trying to quiet down her younger child, a baby. Dunlop's poem took an \\"immediate, visceral, political, and poetic\\" approach, addressing the problem of Aboriginals suffering. This style was not what other people and newspapers thought of the massacre. A violent passage in the Sydney Herald told people that if Aboriginal Australians, referred to as the \\"filthy, brutal cannibals of New Holland\\" and \\"ferocious savages\\", attempt to destroy property or kill someone, \\"do to them as you would do to any white robbers or murderers ‚Äî SHOOT THEM DEAD\\". A passage in The Sydney Monitor and Commercial Advertiser showed a conversation between a \\"country gentleman\\" and a \\"town gentleman\\", which took place directly after the hanging of the seven murderers. It ended with the country gentleman saying \\"we are poisoning the Blacks; which is much safer; and serve them right too!\\" Dunlop also had another copy of the poem which she kept to herself. This version is \\"even more revealing\\", showing the discovery of the dead bodies of the children killed during the event as well as more details about the trials in court. In addition, it shows how a woman and a baby were able to escape and how two other children tried to escape but failed. The poem is nine stanzas long, with each stanza having eight lines, making a total of 72 lines. The poem follows an ABCB rhyme scheme throughout. The first stanza is composed of the following:  Reception  The poem has been recounted by scholars as relating to the poems \\"Indian Woman's Death Song,\\" written by Felicia Hemans in 1828, \\"The Cherokee Mother,\\" written by Lydia Sigourney in 1831, and other works of the time period described as \\"crying mother\\" poems. After the poem was published again in 1841, it was criticized significantly by the Sydney Herald. This caused Dunlop to write a letter to the Sydney Herald's editor, arguing on behalf of the poem and explaining why her views were correct. After the poem was performed as a song by Rosetta Nathan, it received more press coverage. It was complimented by The Australasian Chronicle, praising the way it was performed. An article in The Australian complimented the way it was sung and the \\"peculiar degree of pathos\\", but also mentioned that the performance may have been affected by an absence of confidence. The performance was also covered by the Sydney Gazette, which wrote a substantial article about it with significant praise, saying that \\"We were in spite of ourselves affected even to tears, and most of our neighbours from a similar state, were prevented observing our weakness.\\" The reviewer of the Sydney Gazette article believed that the song would be popular and frequently performed in concerts, but was also concerned about what people outside of Australia would think of the song and thought that the song contained \\"misplaced emotions\\". Elizabeth Webby later described the poem as \\"a radical treatment of Aboriginal subjectivity\\", stating that it was written so that readers would react intensely towards the poem after reading it.  Song  \\"The Aboriginal Mother\\" was set to music by Isaac Nathan, an English composer. Although Nathan ended up putting a number of lyrics written by Dunlop to music, \\"The Aboriginal Mother\\" was the first. The song was first performed publicly by Rosetta Nathan, Isaac's daughter, in October 1841, during a performance titled \\"Nathan's Grand Concert.\\" The music was published in Sydney in 1842. The lyrics in the song are different than the original poem in many ways, particularly in the last stanza.

The details of the siege are largely unknown, and most of the known events were recorded in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. Background In August 1009, a large Danish army led by Thorkell the Tall landed on the shores of Sandwich. The army initially targeted the city of Canterbury to pillage, but were promptly paid 3000 pounds of silver in danegeld by the people of Kent to sway the army from attacking. Instead, the army went on to raid the rest of Southern England.The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle The Siege By 8 September 1011, the army returned and laid siege to Canterbury, with the Anglo-Saxon forces relentlessly defending the city. Fellow Viking Olaf Haraldsson was also said to have joined Thorkell in the raid. After three weeks of fighting, the Vikings finally managed to break through into the city. Christian sources cite this as being due to the treachery of a traitor named √Ülfmaer, whose life had been previously saved by the archbishop of Canterbury, √Ülfheah.The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle Thorkell and his men laid siege to Canterbury and took several hostages of importance, including √Ülfheah himself. Godwine (Bishop of Rochester), Leofrun (abbess of St Mildrith's), and the king's reeve, √Ülfweard were captured also, but the abbot of St Augustine's Abbey, √Ülfm√¶r, managed to escape. Canterbury Cathedral was plundered and burned by the Danes following √Ülfheah's capture.Barlow English Church 1000‚Äì1066 pp. 209‚Äì210 Aftermath √Ülfheah was held captive for seven months.Hindley Brief History of the Anglo-Saxons p. 301 The Vikings held √Ülfheah for ransom and demanded 3000 pounds of silver for his release. √Ülfheah refused to be ransomed or have his people pay the invaders. This eventually culminated in the archbishop's murder where he was pelted with the bones of cattle before being finished off with a blow from the butt of an axe.The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle Thorkell was seemingly against this, and was said to have tried his best to prevent the death of the archbishop, offering the attackers everything he possessed to stop the killing, save for his ship. Either out of disgust of this act or sensing the loss of control of his own men, Thorkell and a group of loyalists defected to serve the English king √Üthelred the Unready as mercenaries, taking 45 Viking ships with them.

The basis for most biographies of Lizzie Rutherford is A History of the Origin of Memorial Day as Adopted by the Ladies‚Äô Memorial Association of Columbus, Georgia, a revised history of the Memorial Day holiday published in 1898. These biographical sketches include the one in the New Georgia Encyclopedia by David S. Williams and Georgia's Landmarks, Memorials and Legends by Lucian Lamar Knight as well as shorter references like that in Race and Reunion by David Blight. Few delve any deeper.  Early life and the Civil War  Elizabeth Rutherford was the daughter of Adolphus S. Rutherford and Susan Thweatt, born in Columbus, Georgia on June 1, 1833. Her father was clerk of the court and represented Muscogee County at the secession convention in 1861, along with Henry Benning and James N. Ramsey. She was active in soldiers‚Äô welfare issues as Secretary of the Soldiers‚Äô Aid Society as well as working personally with the wounded soldiers at local hospitals.  Post-Civil War  Lizzie remained active with the Soldiers‚Äô Aid Society until it the group was reconstituted as the Ladies‚Äô Memorial Association of Columbus, Georgia (LMA) in early 1866. The LMA, represented by its secretary and Lizzie's cousin, Mrs. Mary Ann Williams (also known as Mrs. Charles J. Williams) wrote a letter to the press proposing a new annual holiday to decorate soldiers‚Äô graves and signed ‚ÄúSouthern Women.‚Äù The holiday was inaugurated across the South on April 26, 1866 with wide newspaper coverage in the North. Several stories focused on the observances in Columbus, Mississippi and Macon, Georgia where Union graves were also decorated. The observance in Augusta, Georgia also received a lot press when a group of former slaves were refused permission to decorate Union graves in that city. On July 4, 1866, General John A. Logan mentioned the observance in a speech in Salem, Illinois. The observances were repeated in 1867 and 1868. Logan, now commander-in-chief of the Grand Army of the Republic, adopted the holiday for the North on May 30, 1868. The April 26th version of holiday became known as \\"Confederate Memorial Day\\" thereafter. Later that year, Lizzie married Captain Roswell Ellis of the Columbus Guards on November 24, 1868. Lizzie died on March 31, 1873 and was honored by the soldiers whose welfare she had supported during the war. Mrs. Williams died a year later. Both were honored at subsequent Memorial Day observances. During their lifetimes, it appears that neither lady personally sought credit for the founding of the holiday. However, after her death, Mrs. Williams was immediately credited for the origination of the holiday.  Revisions to Memorial Day origin story  In the early 1890s, as the next generation of ladies began taking over the LMA, the story of the founding of Memorial Day began to change. In 1891, new headstones were ordered for the soldiers as well as Lizzie and Mrs. Williams. The inscription on Mrs. Williams' headstone reads \\"Mrs. Charles J. Williams, In loving recognition of her memorial work by her co-workers.\\" Lizzie's headstone reads \\"The Soldiers' Friend, Lizzie Rutherford Ellis, She hath done what she could. - Mark xiv. 8, A loving tribute to our co-worker, Mrs. Lizzie Rutherford Ellis. In her patriotic heart , sprang the thought of our Memorial Day.\\" This appears to be the first public claim that Lizzie originated the holiday. In 1898 and with help of the United Daughters of the Confederacy, the LMA revised the history of the organization and put Lizzie forward as the suggestor of the holiday. Affidavits were procured from the two surviving attendees of the LMA organizational meeting; Mrs. Woolfolk and Mrs. Dexter as well as Jane Martin, the daughter of another of the original attendees. In their book, The Genesis of the Memorial Day Holiday in America, Bellware and Gardiner expose several inconsistencies between the revised story and the historical record. * LMA claims that it was Lizzie‚Äôs idea, as Secretary of the Soldiers‚Äô Aid Society, to reconstitute the group to the LMA with the purpose to memorialize the soldiers in 1866 with a new annual holiday. However, the LMA failed to reward its supposed founder with an officer position in the new organization. * No mention is made of Lizzie‚Äôs contribution to the origin of Memorial Day in her obituary in 1873. By contrast, Mrs. Williams‚Äô earliest death notices and obituary in 1874 clearly credit her with originating the holiday. * During the bricklaying ceremony on April 1, 1879, Mrs. Woolfolk, who lays a brick in Mrs. Williams‚Äô honor, credits Mrs. Williams with originating the holiday. * On April 13, 1879, the Columbus Enquirer prints the first history of the LMA and credits Mrs. Williams with originating the holiday. Bellware and Gardiner also expose the lukewarm support giving by the affidavits. * Mrs. Woolfolk says that it was common knowledge within the group that Lizzie suggested the holiday but, for her own testimony, she said \\"Of this, I am not able to speak of my own knowledge.\\" * Jane Martin, who was supposedly alone with Lizzie when she formulated the idea of the holiday, had to rely on her mother's memory to support the notion that Lizzie was the \\"suggestor\\" of the day. Bellware and Gardiner also pointed out that in 1898, the LMA claimed that it needed to correct the record because Mrs. Williams took credit by publishing the letter proposing the holiday under her own name. This is demonstrably false as the letter was published with the signature \\"Southern Women\\" in every known instance. An extensive list of extant contemporaneous publications of the letter can be found _here._ At best, it appears that Lizzie simply suggested the day (April 26) to observe the holiday.

Although there is no settled consensus on a single approach, a unifying theme is that, while the social sciences have long modelled themselves on mechanistic science, they can learn much from quantum ideas such as complementarity and entanglement. Some authors are motivated by quantum mind theories that the brain, and therefore human interactions, are literally based on quantum processes, while others are more interested in taking advantage of the quantum toolkit to simulate social behaviours which elude classical treatment. Quantum ideas have been particularly influential in psychology, but are starting to affect other areas such as international relations and diplomacy in what one 2018 paper called a \\"quantum turn in the social sciences\\".  History  The idea that quantum physics might play an important role in living systems has long been considered by physicists. Niels Bohr for example believed that his principle of complementarity extended into both biology and psychology, while Erwin Schr√∂dinger wrote in his 1944 book What is Life? of a \\"quantum theory of biology\\" that saw genetic mutations in terms of quantum leaps. In his 1989 book The Emperor's New Mind, Roger Penrose hypothesized that quantum mechanics plays an essential role in human consciousness. His 1994 follow-up book Shadows of the Mind speculated that these quantum processes take place in microtubules inside neurons. Some physicists have also been willing to consider an even more direct connection between mind and quantum matter, in a quantum version of panpsychism. In his 1975 book Disturbing the Universe, Freeman Dyson wrote that \\"mind is already inherent in every electron, and the processes of human consciousness differ only in degree but not in kind from the processes of choice between quantum states\\". David Bohm's 1951 book Quantum Theory included a chapter on \\"Analogies to Quantum Processes\\" where he considered applications including the understanding of thought processes, and in 1990 he published a paper named \\"A new theory of the relationship of mind and matter\\" which asserts that consciousness permeates all forms of matter. These ideas were popularised and extended by Danah Zohar in books including The Quantum Self and (with Ian Marshall) The Quantum Society. Karen Barad's 2007 book Meeting the Universe Halfway took \\"Niels Bohr's philosophy-physics\\" as a starting point to develop her theory of agential realism. Beginning in the 1990s, a separate approach to quantum social science was taken by a number of interdisciplinary researchers, working in what became known as quantum cognition, who argued that quantum probability theory was better than classical probability theory at accounting for a range of cognitive effects of the sort studied in behavioral economics. Others worked on developing \\"weak\\" or \\"generalised\\" versions of quantum theory which extended concepts such as complementarity and entanglement to the social domain. In their 2013 book Quantum Social Science, Emmanuel Haven and Andrei Khrennikov developed mathematical formalisms for the application of quantum models to topics including psychology, economics, finance, and brain science. Most researchers in areas such as quantum cognition view the quantum formalism solely as a mathematical toolbox, and do not assume that human cognition is physically based on quantum mechanics. Separately however, researchers in quantum biology have uncovered evidence of quantum effects being exploited in processes such as photosynthesis and avian navigation; and some authors, notably political scientist Alexander Wendt, have argued that human beings are literally what he calls \\"walking wave functions\\".  Core ideas  While quantum social scientists are divided on the question of whether social processes are physically quantum in nature, or just happen to be amenable to a quantum approach, there are a number of common ideas, themes, and concerns. The most fundamental is that, since its inception, social science has been based on a classical worldview, which needs to be updated in accordance with the teachings of quantum physics. In particular, quantum theory disputes the key tenets or assumptions of materialism, determinism, and mechanism. An example is the notion of entanglement. In mechanistic or pre-quantum science, particles are seen as individual entities that interact only in a mechanistic sense. In quantum mechanics, particles such as electrons can become entangled so that a measurement on one instantly affects the state of the other. In quantum social science, people are similarly entangled, whether through shared institutions such as language, or (according to some interpretations) through actual physical processes. An implication is that people are never completely separable, but are entangled elements of society. Another example is the idea of wave function collapse. In standard interpretations of quantum physics, a particle is described by a wave function, and attributes such as position or momentum are only discovered through a measurement procedure which collapses the wave function to one of a number of allowed states. In quantum social science, mental states are best described as potentialities that \\"collapse\\" only when a judgement or decision is made. One consequence of wave function collapse in physics is that a measurement affects the system being studied, and therefore any future measurement. A corresponding phenomenon in social science is the so-called order effect, where responses to survey questions depends on the order in which they are asked.  Applications  Ideas from quantum physics have long inspired thinkers in areas such as politics, diplomacy, and international relations. The journalist Flora Lewis spoke of the \\"Quantum Mechanics of Politics\\" in 1975. In a 1997 lecture on \\"Diplomacy in the Information Age\\", former US Secretary of State George P. Shultz credits the physicist Sidney Drell for coining the term \\"quantum diplomacy\\" to describe how diplomats need to account for uncertainty and the fact that \\"the process of observation itself is a cause of change\\". In a 2011 paper, James Der Derian proposed quantum diplomacy as a way to understand the entanglements brought about by a globalized media and a multiplicity of actors operating at different levels. These ideas have been a theme of Der Derian's annual Q2-Symposium since 2014. In a 2018 address to the Trilateral Commission, Danah Zohar argued that a mechanistic worldview has led to problems from inequality to climate change, and that we need to shift to a quantum perspective which incorporates effects such as uncertainty and entanglement. While Wendt's 2015 book Quantum Mind and Social Science does not focus on political science, it does discuss the applicability of quantum theory to social systems in general, and its publication led to a great deal of analysis and discussion on this topic. Other related areas where quantum ideas are seeing applications include quantum game theory, quantum decision theory, quantum finance and quantum economics. In a 2019 article for the Bretton Woods Committee, Andrew Sheng wrote that \\"A quantum paradigm of finance and the economy is slowly emerging, and its nonlinear, complex nature may help the design of a future global economy and financial architecture.\\"  Criticism  Quantum social science is contested by critics, who argue that it is inappropriately importing ideas from quantum physics to the social domain. The most common criticism is that due to quantum decoherence, quantum effects are filtered out at the macroscopic level, so cannot affect social systems. The physicist Max Tegmark for example has argued that brains cannot sustain quantum coherence. A related topic of controversy is whether quantum science should be applied to social systems only in a metaphorical sense, or whether it should be taken as a physical description of those systems. This in turn relates to a broader debate in the sciences about scientific realism, which applies also to quantum physics.

He was executed by Emperor Gaozong of Song after he surrendered. Early life Before he became a puppet ruler, he was a prime minister serving the Song dynasty. Reign=Formation of Da Chu= The Jin leadership had not expected or desired the fall of the Song dynasty. Their intention was to weaken the Song in order to demand more tribute, and they were unprepared for the magnitude of their victory. The Jurchens were preoccupied with strengthening their rule over the areas once controlled by Liao. Instead of continuing their invasion of the Song, an empire with a military that outnumbered their own, they adopted the strategy of \\"using Chinese to control the Chinese\\". =Enthronement= The Jin hoped a proxy state would be capable of administering Northern China and collecting the annual indemnity without requiring Jurchen interventions to quell Anti-Jin uprisings. Instead of directly annexing the conquered Song territories, the Jin dynasty formed the buffer state of Chu in 1127. Zhang, a former prime minister of the Song Dynasty, was installed as emperor of the new dynasty. He refused to wear the formal clothing of the emperor outside of his encounters with Jin officials. The offer of enthronement was too attractive for Zhang to resist, but he had reservations about his new role. Jiankang, modern Nanjing, became the capital of Chu. The support of Empress Dowager Yuanyou, who was dismissed as Empress by her former spouse Emperor Zhezong, was enlisted to bolster the legitimacy of the puppet government.Lily Xiao Hong Lee, Sue Wiles: Biographical Dictionary of Chinese Women, Volume II: Tang Through Ming 618 - 1644 Unfortunately, Da Chu did not deter the resistance in Northern China, but the insurgents were motivated by their anger towards the Jurchens' looting rather than by a sense of loyalty towards the inept Song court. A number of Song commanders, stationed in towns scattered across northern China, retained their allegiance to the Song, and armed volunteers organized militias opposed to the Jurchen military presence. The insurgency hampered the ability of the Jin to exert control over the north. =Downfall and Death= The Da Chu was abolished when Zhang and Empress Dowager Yuanyou agreed to recognize Emperor Gaozong as the new ruler of the revived Southern Song. Zhang submitted to Gaozong, but was sentenced to death by being coerced into suicide on November 1, 1127. Gaozong ordered the execution under pressure from Li Gang, his chief councilor, who opposed diplomatic reconciliation with the Jin and wanted Zhang executed for collaborating with the Jurchen government. Legacy The elimination of Zhang and the Chu buffer state infringed on the treaty that the Jin and Song had negotiated. The Jin then recommenced their war with the Song. The invasion was hampered by the ongoing insurgency by Song loyalists in Northern China.

It tells the story of a young man of humble origin whose determination led him from his position as a gravedigger in the Fields of Death of Lin'an to a position at the prestigious Ming Academy. The novel was first published October 5, 2011 in Spain as El Lector de Cad√°veres and was then translated by Thomas Bunstead and published May 25, 2013 in United States as The Corpse Reader.  Plot  The book is about a forensic elite who, even at the risk of their own lives, had a mandate that no criminal should go unpunished. S√≤ng C√≠ was the first of them, a young man of humble origin who rises to high position. Most of the novel takes place the Imperial Court.  Characters  *Song Ci: The protagonist of the story, Ci has a strange disorder, scientifically named CIPA (Congenital Insensitivity to Pain with Anhidrosis), which prevents him from perceiving pain. *Judge Feng: The boss of Ci's father, a high imperial official in Lin'an and one of the best judges of the Chinese empire, respected and admired by all for his incorruptibility, wisdom and good judgment when dictating the sentences of cases who were presented. The protagonist considers him as a second father. *Third: The sister of C√≠ Song and only survivor, along with her brother, of the fire that devastated the family home in the village. She is 7 years old and suffers from the same illness that brought her two older sisters (First and Second) to the grave \\"Third was the only one who had managed to survive, though she remained sickly\\". C√≠ is forced to keep her, which will make him get into more than one mess. *Professor Ming: Director of the academy that bears his name and one of the most reputable doctors in the empire, although he also serves as a judge. Soon he realizes the potential of C√≠ Song and will immediately reveal himself as his greatest defender. *Gray: A young nobleman who studies at the Ming academy and who C√≠ Song has the misfortune of having him as a roommate. Ambitious and lacking in all kinds of scruples, he does not hesitate to appropriate the discoveries of the protagonist when it comes to ascending in the academy and reaching the position for the judiciary that is at stake.  Development  Garrido became interested in Ci Song while attending a conference in New Delhi, as he was curious about the individual seen as the first coroner and the historical beginnings of forensic discipline. As he continued to research he uncovered information about Judge Feng and a Dutch sinologist, which Garrido incorporated into the book. The documentation period was twelve months longer to gather information in the political, cultural, social, judicial, economic, religious, military and sexual fields, together with exhaustive references in the fields of medicine, education, architecture, food , furniture, clothing, measurement systems, currency, state organization and bureaucracy in medieval China of the Song Dynasty. Garrido attended to an autopsy accompanied by Dr. Juan Jose Payo Barrose, forensic doctor and director of the Institute of Legal Medicine of Alicante. All in order to describe with details, he wanted to feel with his own skin the same sensations that C√≠ Song should have felt because he thought that was the only way to transmit to the audience what Ci had experienced.  Critical reception  The novel has received reviews from outlets such as The Japan Times and Ars Technica, the latter of which stated that it was a \\"refreshing break from the urban-noir fetish that is so common in conventional thrillers and crime books\\". AudioFile reviewed the English audio adaptation narrated by Todd Haberkorn, praising his pronunciation and timing.

Kryczka graduated from the University of Alberta, and played hockey with the Golden Bears. He practiced law in Calgary for more than 20 years, beginning in 1959 as a lawyer, becoming a judge, and was eventually elevated to a justice on the Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta. His hockey administration career included tenures as president of the Alberta Amateur Hockey Association from 1967 to 1969, and later the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association from 1971 to 1973. Kryczka successfully resolved several notable disagreements in Canadian hockey. When the Western Canada Hockey League broke away from the governing body, Kryczka was able to reunite the league with the rest of Canada, which maintained the continuity of the threatened Memorial Cup. He brought Alberta hockey back under the national umbrella when it resigned, and later dealt with the World Hockey Association when it raided rosters of Canadian junior teams without compensation. Kryczka was the lead negotiator in securing the agreement for Canada to play the Soviet Union at the 1972 Summit Series. His negotiating skills went unrecognized at the time, and his contributions were overshadowed by Alan Eagleson. Kryczka was later a director with the Calgary Cowboys, and played a key role with Calgary's successful bid for the 1988 Winter Olympics. He was inducted into both Canada's Sports Hall of Fame and the Alberta Sports Hall of Fame in 1990, for his service to Canadian sports and ice hockey. Early life Kryczka was born and raised in the village of Coleman, Alberta. Joseph Julius Kryczka was born on June 4, 1935, in Coleman, Alberta.Mardson, Austin & Ernest (2011), p. 102 He grew up playing minor ice hockey until the juvenile age level in Coleman. He played on the 1949‚Äì50 midget team which won the Alberta championship,Ferguson, Bob (2005), p. 244 and was captain of the juvenile team in the 1951‚Äì52 season. He attended Coleman High School, and received a bursary from the Elks of Canada for having the highest marks in grade nine. He graduated with honours in 1953 as the class valedictorian. Kryczka enrolled at University of Alberta in 1953, and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1957. He was active in student life, serving as president of both the political science and law clubs, and was secretary of the student council. He played junior baseball for his Coleman team in summers. He played three seasons of ice hockey as a defenceman with the Golden Bears, and was teammates with his brother Adam in 1955. He won three Dr. W. G. Hardy Trophy titles as a Western Canadian Intercollegiate Athletic Union champion in 1954, 1955 and 1956. He earned two varsity letters in university, but a shoulder injury ended his playing career. He completed his law degree in 1958 at the University of Alberta. The university awarded him a gold ring for scholastic achievements and the Lorne Calhoun Memorial Award for his contributions to student activities. Kryczka became an articled clerk in Calgary under future Court of Appeal of Alberta justice David Clifton Prowse, and was called to the bar in 1959. He was originally associated with the law firm of Peter Lougheed in the early 1960s, and then became a partner of Mason and Kryczka. He later served as vice-president of the Alberta Young Liberal Association in 1966, and continued to practice law in Calgary until 1980. Alberta hockey Kryczka began volunteering as community hockey coach in 1959, and also refereed in various leagues. He was elected to the executive committee of the Alberta Amateur Hockey Association (AAHA) in 1963, and served as the Calgary Booster Club president from 1964 to 1965.Calgary Booster Club (1986), p. 5 He was elected second vice-president of the AAHA in September 1966, and became its president in October 1967. Kryczka's presidency of the AAHA coincided with the formation of the Western Canada Hockey League (WCHL), which had teams in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba. Various disputes arose with the WCHL, because it was outside of the jurisdiction of the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA), the governing body for the AAHA. In February 1969, the CAHA and Kryczka as president of the AAHA, were named in a lawsuit by the WCHL and its governing body, the Canadian Hockey Association. The WCHL sought development money for its players drafted by the National Hockey League (NHL), as per the draft agreement between the NHL and the CAHA, but the CAHA refused to distribute money to a league it did not sanction. Later that month, Kryczka gave an ultimatum to the Alberta Hockey Referees Association, stating that the AAHA would only use referees which did not officiate in the WCHL. The decision threatened to end an agreement from October 1968, where referees in Alberta formed an independent organization to officiates games for both governing bodies. Later in March, Kryczka suspended two referees who still worked games in the WCHL. At the 1969 CAHA annual general meeting, Kryczka said that the WCHL succeeded in drawing many fans, and gave an opportunity for many young men to play in Western Canada. He also felt that CAHA branches such as Alberta, should be able to establish a major junior category for higher-level competition, similar to what the WCHL did across three provinces. The CAHA reorganized its committees to give more representation at the national level to its leagues, but the motion to have a major junior classification was defeated. CAHA vice-president The Memorial Cup is awarded to the junior ice hockey champion of Canada, and its status was threatened in 1971 while Kryczka was vice-president of the CAHA. Kryczka was elected vice-president of the CAHA in May 1969. In September 1969, he was optimistic that the CAHA and the WCHL would be able to agree on reuniting. He felt it would be possible if the WCHL agreed to appropriately compensate CAHA teams from which players were signed, and that there would be no expansion into cities with an existing CAHA team. He further confirmed that the CAHA had not approved of its players being signed by the WCHL, or relocation into its territory. He said that the CAHA would not agree to those demands of the WCHL, which are against CAHA regulations. Later in 1969, Canada and the CAHA withdrew from play in the Ice Hockey World Championships over a dispute with the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) regarding the use of professionals, which began a continuing feud between Kryczka, and IIHF president Bunny Ahearne. The CAHA added multiple vice-presidents as of 1970, and Kryczka was elected first vice-president by acclamation on May 29, 1970. He took objection to Clarence Campbell stating that the NHL may need to revert to direct ownership of teams, because of concessions made to the WCHL, and having different age limits across Canada's junior hockey system. Kryczka felt that the CAHA adequately resolved its disagreements with the WCHL, and did not need NHL personnel getting involved. He stated that the 1971 Memorial Cup would not likely be played, due to the Ontario Hockey Association Junior A division and the Quebec Junior Hockey League being in disagreement with the number overage players in the WCHL. He mentioned the potential for changing regulations at the upcoming general meeting, requiring teams to agree to the competition in order to receive development funds from the NHL agreement. CAHA president=First year= Kryczka succeeded Earl Dawson as president of the CAHA, on May 29, 1971. The role also made him a director with Hockey Canada for two years. He hoped to make the CAHA financially independent of both the NHL and the Government of Canada, and become more of an administrative body. Shortly after becoming president, Kryczka announced a resolution to the Memorial Cup competition, where the Ontario and Quebec leagues agreed to compete with the Western Canada teams which gave up having extra overage players. As part of the agreement, all three leagues were invited to participate in the meetings to renew the CAHA-NHL contract when it expired in 1972. In June 1971, he announced that the CAHA had rejected an invitation from the IIHF to return to play in the World Championships, since Canada would still not be able to use its professional players. Later that year in September, Kryczka stated that the CAHA had not been invited to play in the 1972 Winter Olympics in Sapporo, and accused Ahearne of political grandstanding for saying that Canada could be removed from the IIHF for its refusal to play. Kryczka met with Harold Wright of the Canadian Olympic Association (COA) in September to review the situation, and Wright confirmed that the COA received an invitation to the Winter Olympics on July 28. Wright felt that the decision was in disregard to recreational hockey in Canada, and that the CAHA should send a team, as the Olympics was a different and unrelated tournament, compared to the World Championships. The CAHA was urged by the COA to send an amateur team, since the Canadian Interuniversity Athletics Union (CIAU) proposed sending a team in lieu of the CAHA. Despite the discussions, Kryczka was committed to the CAHA's withdrawal from international play, until it could use its best players against the Europeans. He stated that Canada would voice its concerns at the next IIHF general meeting in the summer of 1972. He felt that the IIHF should allow professionals in the World Championships similar to FIFA, and reiterated that the CAHA had a good relationship with the NHL, which would release such players for an event. Kryczka remained open to other competitions, which included the Izvestia Cup. The Hotel International Prague, where negotiations took place for the 1972 Summit Series. Meanwhile, Kryczka had been collaborating for two years with Charles Hay from Hockey Canada, in attempts to convince the Soviet Union to play Canada in a hockey series allowing professional players.Houston & Shoalts (1993), pp. 76‚Äì77 In February 1972, the Canadian Bureau of Public Affairs empowered Kryczka, Hay and Lou Lefaive from Sport Canada, to oversee diplomatic efforts to return Canada to international ice hockey, and gave them needed assistance from Canadian embassies in Europe, and specifically the Embassy of Canada in Moscow.Macintosh & Hawes (1994), p. 32 Other notable Canadians involved in the process included Gordon Juckes from the CAHA, Doug Fisher and Allan Scott from Hockey Canada, Robert Ford the Canadian ambassador in Moscow, and translator Aggie Kukulowicz who worked at Air Canada in Moscow. The negotiations for a Canada-Soviet series were finalized at the Hotel International Prague during the 1972 World Ice Hockey Championships. Kryczka was chosen as the lead negotiator on behalf of the Canadian delegation due to his legal background. He also went into the negotiations with an understanding of the Russian language, but never revealed this to the Soviets.McKinley, Michael (2014), p. 168 As a child, his neighbours were Russian immigrants who never spoke to him in English. After each day of negotiating, he informed Hay of what the Soviets had said to each other. Kryczka later gave an interview to journalist Jim Coleman, and said that the Soviets had previously decided they could defeat any NHL team, and drew out negotiations to get more concessions on the rules of play.Houston & Shoalts (1993), p. 206 The final agreement negotiated by Kryczka stipulated that Soviet players were to be paid per game in Canada, and Canadian players were to be paid SUR5,000 per game in Moscow. It also stipulated the choice of referees was acceptable to both parties. It was signed on April 18, 1972, and agreed to an eight-game series where both Team Canada and the Soviet Team were allowed unrestricted rosters which included professionals. The two-page document had no official seal or letterhead, but included the signatures of Kryczka, Andrey Starovoytov as the general secretary of the Soviet Union Ice Hockey Federation, and the approvals of Ahearne as the president of the IIHF, and former CAHA president Fred Page as the vice-president of the IIHF. Kryczka and Starovoytov announced the agreement later the same day, but Kryczka did not promise that Canada return to the playing at the World Championships. After the successful negotiations with the Soviets, he intended to table a similar proposal for the World Ice Hockey Championships at the next summer congress of the IIHF. United Press International reported that upcoming Soviet series likely indicated Canada's return to international play, and the IIHF would likely vote in favour of Canada's proposal to include professionals. Kryczka was also encouraged by feedback from IIHF vice-president Page, who was keeping the CAHA informed of international matters, and was also a CAHA director-at-large. =Second year= Kryczka began his second year as president by speaking to delegates at the 1972 general meeting of the CAHA. He warned of a government report which recommended a paid commissioner to run and oversee amateur hockey in Canada. He felt that would take away the incentive for parents to volunteer in amateur hockey, and kill programs at the grass roots levels of hockey. The meeting saw the CAHA vote down a rule amendment that would have allowed Karen Koch to play on a men's team, and Kryczka announced that the CAHA would study its organizational structure, and would be prepared to include female teams and leagues in the future. Also at the meeting, the AAHA gave notice of resignation from the CAHA, due to differences arising from the CAHA-NHL agreement. The AAHA felt that the CAHA should charge registration fees to players for its administration fees, rather than be bound by the NHL and rely on it for income. Kryczka remained confident that an Alberta branch could be reformed, and operate with the CAHA. He announced in August 1972, that the AAHA rejoined the CAHA after working out their differences. The 1972 summer congress of the IIHF was held in the Romanian Black Sea resort district of Mamaia, in Constan»õa. Kryczka went to the 1972 summer congress of the IIHF in Mamaia, Romania, to make his proposal for professionals at the World Championships, and was also expecting a North American delegate to replace Ahearne as IIHF president. The president's position had alternated every three years between Europe and North America, as part of the agreement for the CAHA and the Amateur Hockey Association of the United States (AHAUS) to join the IIHF in 1947. Kryczka had been a vocal opponent of IIHF president Ahearne, and criticized Ahearne's meetings as non- parliamentary, and not following acceptable procedures. The North America delegation made Page its unanimous nominee, but instead of Page being acclaimed president, Ahearne declared a vote must take place, and the Europeans disapproved of the nomination. Kryczka was subsequently nominated by the United States, but he declined the position feeling he wasn't experienced enough. After a brief recess and then CAHA secretary Juckes also being voted down, Ahearne was reelected in lieu of an acceptable North American candidate. The roster for the Canada-Soviet series was chosen in August, by a committee composed of members from the CAHA, Hockey Canada, the NHL, and the National Hockey League Players' Association (NHLPA). Kryczka was disappointed that players from the World Hockey Association (WHA) were excluded from the series since he felt the team should be open all Canadians regardless of which professional league they played for, but he ultimately accepted the decision. The CAHA scheduled additional exhibition games for the Canadian team while in Europe playing the Soviets, that caused Kryczka and Ahearne to disagree over the television rights of a game against Czechoslovakia, when the CAHA refused to pay royalties to the IIHF which threatened to not sanction the game. Palace of Sports of the Central Lenin Stadium in Moscow. The Canada-Soviet series began September 2, 1972, and Canadians believed they would easily defeat the Soviets. Instead, after seven games it was tied with 3 wins each and a draw. The Canadians and Soviets disagreed over who should referee the final eighth match. Kryczka was against having the West German officials Josef Kompalla and Franz Baader referee the game, and demanded to have Ove Dahlberg of Sweden, and Rudy Batja of Czechoslovakia. A compromise was reached that included Kompalla and Batja as referees for the eighth game, and in the pregame ceremony Kryczka and Alan Eagleson presented the Soviet hosts with a totem pole as a gift from Canada. Canada went on to win the final game by a 6‚Äì5 score, and won the series 4 games to three, with a draw. Kryczka received little credit at the time for his role in the series and was overshadowed by Eagleson, with whom he shared a mutual dislike. Eagleson was attending the World Championships and was not part of the negotiations, but he was the first person to phone Canada from Prague, and take credit for the event by reporting the agreement.Macintosh & Hawes (1994), p. 33 Journalist Remy Greer argued that, \\"if it wasn‚Äôt for the negotiating prowess of Kryczka, the series might never have happened\\". Eagleson felt that series was made by the NHL players, and gave no thanks to others involved. He felt that Kryczka only helped with the totem pole, and nothing else. Kryczka's wife later said that she needed to sit between them at each game, as they were both \\"loud-mouthed lawyers\\" with a \\"hate-hate relationship\\". The Canada-Soviet series later became known as the Summit Series, and fostered a source of national pride as a significant historical event.Henderson & Prime (2011), p. 106 Kryczka said that Canadian amateur hockey gained from the series because the CAHA earned $100,000 as its share of the profits, and it would be probable to see another similar professional event due to public demand. He also speculated that the success of the CAHA in negotiating the series, may render the rival Hockey Canada structure obsolete. He was open to more tournaments and games which followed IIHF statutes, and condemned reports that the NHL and the NHLPA were trying to negotiate international games on their own for the sake of keeping profits to themselves, instead of following proper international procedures. He felt that the CAHA deserved its credit for developing the international game, and opening the door for the NHL to play the Soviets. He said that European clubs were interested in playing, as long as sanctioning went through the IIHF, the CAHA or AHAUS. Canada later played the Soviets again in the 1974 Summit Series, which led to the establishment of the Canada Cup in 1976, and the subsequent return of Team Canada to the World Championships in 1977. After the 1972 series, Kryczka gave a directive to the minor ice hockey council of the CAHA to find ways to improve its youth development system, and catch up to the Soviet system. He looked towards junior hockey as the next big stage for international hockey to be played at the IIHF World U20 Championship being planned in 1974, and said that Canada and the USA had been collaborating on a planned 1975 event. He also said that at the junior age level, there would be no concerns over who is or is not a professional player, and that the CAHA agreed to send the reigning Memorial Cup champion to represent Canada at the events. Kryczka announced in January 1973, that he would not seek reelection as CAHA president. Kryczka's remaining four months as president were occupied by dealing with the WHA competing for junior-aged players, and threatening the CAHA's existing draft and development agreement with the NHL. Kryczka had previously sent a letter to WHA president Gary Davidson, requesting the league honour the age at which players become professionals, as agreed with the NHL. On February 15, 1973, the WHA permitted its teams one month to negotiate and sign any junior, college, or non-professional of amateur draft age, which Kryczka called disruptive to junior hockey. He warned CAHA teams that any player which signed a professional contract would be ruled ineligible to continue playing in the CAHA. Kryczka and Juckes set up a meeting on February 23, 1973, between the CAHA, each of its three leagues, and the WHA to the discuss attempted signings of junior players without paying development fees. When the Houston Aeros signed underage players Marty Howe and Mark Howe to professional contracts, Kryczka stated that the WHA was continuing to undermine the junior hockey system in Canada. In his final speech as president of the CAHA at the 1973 general meeting, he expressed his disappointment in the negotiations being broken off by WHA which claimed development fees being too high. He felt that the WHA was trying to break apart unity by attempting to deal directly with the WCHL instead of the CAHA, and he also discounted rumors that the Saskatchewan Amateur Hockey Association wanted to break away from the CAHA. Later life Entrance to the Court of Queens Bench of Alberta in Calgary, where Kryczka served as a justice Kryczka was succeeded as president of the CAHA by Jack Devine, on May 25, 1973 at the annual meeting. After his term as president, Kryczka was appointed chairman of the CAHA rules committee, and was responsible for enforcing discipline. He fined the Humboldt Broncos management $500, for refusing to play game six of the 1973 Centennial Cup playoffs. At the 1974 general meeting, the rules committee aimed to reduce eye injuries and obscenities directed at referees, and empowered the officials to enforce the appropriate rules more strictly. At the 1975 general meeting, the rules committee dealt with the increase of violence in hockey, recommended more severe penalties for cross-checking and high-sticking above the shoulders, raised the punishment for abuse of officials, and suggested game misconducts to deter fighting. Kryczka was one of directors for the Calgary Cowboys team in the WHA. During the 1976 WHA playoffs versus the Quebec Nordiques, Kryczka felt that the league caved into the demands of Quebec, because the Nordiques threatened to abandon the series after a series of on- ice incidents. He agreed with the ultimate decision to continue the series, and avoid further discredit to the WHA. Kryczka stated that Calgary needed to build a replacement for the Stampede Corral, in order to remain competitive in major league hockey. When rumors surfaced that the Cowboys were considering moving to the proposed Copps Coliseum to be built in Hamilton, Ontario, he denied that the team wanted to move, and reiterated a commitment to the city. Kryczka was recognized as a Queen's Counsel in 1975, for accomplishments as a lawyer, and contributions to the community. He was appointed to the Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta by Jean Chr√©tien in July 1980, the then Minister of Justice of Canada. Kryczka was subsequently sworn-in as a justice by W. R. Sinclair at Calgary. Kryczka served as a justice on the Court of Queen's Bench for the remainder of his life. As a lawyer, he acted as legal counsel for the Alberta Hockey Referees Association, when the organization disputed suspensions by the AAHA for referees officiating games in 1978 without wearing helmets. Kryczka was named the director of legal affairs for Calgary's 1988 Winter Olympics bid in 1979. He worked with the Canadian Olympic Committee, and helped win the first Winter Olympic Games hosted in Canada. He met with members of the International Olympic Committee, and was confident that the American-led boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics would not affect the voting for Calgary's bid. The Soviet Olympic Committee told Calgary bid president Frank King, that it would vote for Canada, if Kryczka ran the hockey events. After the Olympics, Kryczka became a director on the Canadian Olympic Development Association. Kryczka was later diagnosed with intestinal cancer. He died January 11, 1991, at Foothills Medical Centre, and was interred at St. Mary's Cemetery in Calgary. Family Joe and brother Adam Kryczka (right) were teammates on the Golden Bears in 1955. Kryczka was the second of three sons to Joseph and Maria Kryczka, who immigrated to Canada in 1934 from Zabawa, Poland. His father worked in the coalfields at Crowsnest Pass. His eldest brother Ted also played hockey for the Golden Bears, once participated in a Chicago Blackhawks training camp, and was a town counselor for Coleman from 1961 to 1978. His younger brother Adam was a goaltender on the Golden Bears, and is the namesake of the Adam Kryczka Memorial Trophy. Kryczka was married to Marion North during summit series. At the time of his death, he was married to Beverley Kryczka, and was survived by four children, his mother, his older brother Ted, and one granddaughter. His son Patrick married Nicole Dunsdon, a former Miss Canada, and their son Spencer, played hockey for the Okotoks Oilers, and the Princeton Tigers. Kryczka's sister-in-law was Alberta politician Karen Kryczka, who was married to his brother Adam. His niece Kelly Kryczka was an Olympic medalist, and the daughter of Adam and Karen. His family kept souvenirs from the Summit Series, including the original two-page document signed in Prague, which had been stored in a safe at his law office. Honours and awards Kryczka was named the 1972 Air Canada Amateur Sports Executive of the Year. As part of its awards program, Air Canada donated a block of 20 air passes to the CAHA on behalf of Kryczka. He received a special achievement award in hockey from the Calgary Booster Club in 1972,Calgary Booster Club (1986), p. 7 and was made an honorary life member of the club in 1982.Calgary Booster Club (1986), p. 1 He was inducted into the Hockey Alberta Hall of Fame in 1984. Kryczka was recognized for his contributions to sports and ice hockey in Canada by induction as a builder into the both the Alberta Sports Hall of Fame, and Canada's Sports Hall of Fame in 1990. Other honours include being made a life member of the CAHA, a life member of Hockey Alberta, and a life director of the Calgary Olympic Development Association. He is also the namesake of the Joe Kryczka Arena, at the Southland Leisure Centre in Calgary.

Started in 1991 as the Cetedoc Library of Christian Latin Texts (CLCLT), it continues to be developed by the Centre ‚ÄòTraditio Litterarum Occidentalium‚Äô and is hosted by Brepols Publishers.  History  In 1991, development of the Cetedoc Library of Christian Latin Texts (CLCLT) started, with the aim of encompassing the entirety of Christian Latin literature. This digital database, initially released as a CD-ROM, was produced by the Cetedoc, led by prof. Paul Tombeur at the Universit√© catholique de Louvain. Since 2001, the activities of Cetedoc have been continued in Turnhout, Belgium by the Centre ‚ÄòTraditio Litterarum Occidentalium‚Äô (CTLO), still led by Paul Tombeur. In 2002, it was decided to expand the database's chronological scope beyond medieval and patristic times, its name was changed to Library of Latin Texts. In 2009, a B series (LLT-B) was added to the original LLT (hence known as LLT-A). The LLT-B's scope was to accelerate the growth of the database by directly adopting the text of existing editions, without the intensive research work that is applied to the texts of the LLT-A. This work includes verifying facts related to the text and correcting errors in the printed edition.  Difference between the LLT and similar databases  Unlike similar initiatives, like Corpus Corporum and The Latin Library, the LLT is not an open-access database. This allows for the adoption of copyrighted editions. In fact, while open-access initiatives have to rely on out-of-copyright, possibly outdated editions, the LLT's policy is to select texts that have \\"been edited according to best contemporary scholarly practice\\". The texts edited in Brepols' Corpus Christianorum series form the core of the LLT, even though numerically, they are outnumbered by texts edited in other publishers' series and, if no modern edition is available, by out-of-copyright editions. Nevertheless, for scholarly purposes, the LLT should be used in conjunction with the printed editions, as the critical apparatus is not included in the database.Crown, Ron W. (2000).

The painting is owned by an anonymous Japanese collector, it measures approximately 158 by 60 centimetres, and depicts the cosmic view of Manichaeism in vivid colours on a silk cloth. The painting was discovered by with his research team in 2010, and identified as a depiction of the cosmos according to the Manichaean religion. According to the team, this piece of art was probably produced by a painter from southern China (Zhejiang or Fujian province) around the period of Yuan dynasty, which ruled China from 1271 to 1368; and the only painting currently known that covers Manichaeism's cosmologic view in complete form. How and when it was transferred to Japan is a mystery.  Description  Under the Manichaean view of the universe, the world is formed by ten layers of heaven and eight layers of the Earth. The separated top section depicts paradise, below it are the sun (right) and moon palaces, which are shown in two circles. Then the ten layers of heaven, where angels, demons and the twelve zodiac signs are included. Below the ten firmaments of heaven are the eight layers of the Earth, the Mount Meru is shown as a mushroom-shaped mountain on the ground where humans live; and hell is depicted in the lowermost part.  Analysis  \\"Mani as observer\\": the white robed priest, the silhouette of his face against the green halo. After carefully studying the painting, and comparing it with the Manichaean materials found in Xinjiang, the westernmost region of China, the members of Yoshida's research team concluded that the painting is Manichaean because it includes a priest wearing a white robe with red piping that is characteristic of Manichaean priests. According to the historian Zsuzsanna Gul√°csi, the white robed priest‚Äîthe silhouette of whose face against the green halo‚Äîis a depiction of the prophet Mani. In 2009, Professor Yoshida raised an idea that this painting might constitute a Chinese version of Mani's Book of Pictures, and subsequently by . In her book Mani's Pictures: The Didactic Images of the Manichaeans from Sasanian Mesopotamia to Uygur Central Asia and Tang-Ming China, the Hungarian historian of religion Zsuzsanna Gul√°csi, who is also a specialist on Manichaeism, explaining the possible relation between this painting and Mani's Book of Pictures.

Hall is most notable for publishing a paper with Dr Gillian Baird, on the role of primary care in identifying developmental problems in children that later resulted in the series of books being published called Health for all children that led in turn to one of the first attempts to apply an objective evidence based approach to medical practice for children. Hall is emeritus professor of community paediatrics at the Institute of General Practice and Primary Care, University of Sheffield. Biography Hall was born in Reigate, Surrey, where he was educated at Reigate Grammar School. His early medical training was at King's College London (MB BS, BSc). Hall studied medicine at St George's Hospital and the University of London graduating with a Gold medal and qualifying in 1969. From 1973‚Äì78, he was Senior Medical Officer at Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital in Johannesburg. Hall met his wife at King's College, London, Susan Hall. Susan Hall is a public health specialist, and an honorary professor at the School of Child and Adolescent Health, University of Cape Town. They have two daughters and two granddaughters. Hall retired in 2005 and moved with his wife Susan, to Cape Town. In Cape Town, the Halls were active in their retirements, working in the area of KwaZulu-Natal in local projects, as well as teaching and lecturing at the Red Cross War Memorial Children's Hospital in Cape Town. Indeed, through their efforts, the Halls managed to establish a Master's degree in paediatric public health. Career After graduation, Hall took a position as house officer at Croydon University Hospital. Hall spent a year in Canada as an intern at the Janeway Children's Health and Rehabilitation Centre. It was the internship that defined his specialism. Upon returning to the UK, Hall took a position as a paediatric audiologist at the Royal National Throat, Nose and Ear Hospital. Hall spent a further year at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital for Children as a senior house officer. In 1973, Hall and his family moved to Baragwanath Hospital in Johannesburg, South Africa for a 3-year posting with his wife. At Baragwanath Hospital, Hall studied paediatrics, neonatology as well as Pediatric Neurology and this set his career specialism in place, with an interest in childhood disability. When Hall returned to the UK, he obtained a position at the Charing Cross Hospital as a senior registrar in child development. From 1978 Hall was appointed to the position of consultant at St George's Hospital in London. As a consultant Hall was responsible for children with disabilities. In 1993, Hall moved to University of Sheffield and was promoted to Professor of community paediatrics. While at Sheffield, Hall developed a Master's degree programme for neurodisability advanced education standards for paediatricians, worked as an investigator on the National Evaluation of the Sure Start campaign as well as consult on Scoliosis and adolescence for the Department of Health and Social Care. Hall became emeritus Professor of Community Paediatrics in 2005. In June 2006, Hall acting within a group of 30 leading scientists, including child health experts, wrote an open letter to the UK Government, and the people of the United Kingdom, in an effort to close the autism and MMR vaccine controversy. Hall stated that: > \\"The time has come to draw a line under the question of any association > between the MMR vaccine and autism. The UK's children are in danger of > serious illness or death if they are left unimmunised.\\" Health for all children In 1985, Hall published a paper with Gillian Baird amongst others, on the role of primary care in identifying developmental problems. Hall advanced the idea that there was a strong association between development problems at school entry and well understood parent and family risks to health. The group stated that strategies to improve health care outcomes would include family support, high quality early education and care programmes and early detection of problems at pre-school. Hall presented evidence that strategies and programmes for health care were best delivered inside a service framework, that the group called a framework of progressive universalism, where a universal selection of services for children and families would provide the earliest identification and appropriate treatment of development problems in the child. In 1986, Hall was contacted by the British Paediatric Association and invited to act on the findings of the report. This led to the Hall chairing the Joint Working Party on Child Health Surveillance at the BPA. The group included a number of individuals from different areas of the paediatrics profession. The group reviewed working practices of the paediatrics professions, in all areas of the NHS. The results of the first working party in 1989, was a report, in which the group found there was a complete lack of evidence on the history of development problems in children, and the current reliability of screening tests. A set of activities was proposed to advance the profession. The second edition was widely published. Health for all children was one of the first attempts to use an evidence-based approach in the formulation of health care for children, and it led to vigorous debate in the paediatrics community both in the UK as well as the United States, Scandinavia and Australia. Societies Between 2000 and 2003 Hall was President of the British Paediatric Association. Bibliography The first edition of Health for all children was published by Hall and David Elliman in 1989. The book was built on an evidence review of a project called Child Health Surveillance, that is designed to routinely conduct child health checks for a child in the first five years of their life. The aims of the programme was described and a new approach was proposed. The second edition was published in 1992, with a focus on knowledge and skills, as opposed to professional labels for procedures and processes. The third edition was published in 1996. Its message was that preventative health service for children should extend beyond the narrow child health surveillance, with its focus on the detection of illness and abnormalities in the child, to encompass positive effort to prevent illness and promote good health. The fourth edition was published only 5 years after the third, with the Polnay Report on the Health needs of school-age children published, and the rapidly increasing pace of change, necessitated that a new version was necessary. This version moved further from the old defect-detecting model to a health promotion model, with a focus on how local community health related to the health of the individual child. The child surveillance handbook was a practical handbook that accompanied each report.

History Smart Parks was formed by the merger of two charities ShadowView and Internet of Life in 2017. The organisation operates as a registered charity in the UK and a Stichting with a Social Enterprise model limited company in the Netherlands. The mission of Smart Parks is to utilise technology to assist in anti-poaching and park management across the world. The primary operational focus is to create a network of sensors and technologies that allows permanent live monitoring of assets in the park that is being protected. In 2017 Rwanda‚Äôs Akagera National Park launched the Smart Parks technology which allows park rangers to monitor animals, visitors, and equipment in real-time. The Smart Parks system is based on the LoRa technology a Long Range Wide-Area Network (LoRaWAN) with low- bandwidth, low-power networking technology that can blanket large areas at relatively low costs. Operations In January 2017 The Internet of Life and the ShadowView Foundation organisations co-developed a LoRa-equipped sensor that is implanted directly into a rhinoceros horn for protection against poaching in Akagera National Park. The sensor has given park rangers the ability to accurately monitor the whereabouts and activities of the critically endangered black rhinos and keep them safe from wildlife criminals and poachers. The LoRa-equipped tracking sensor is part of a comprehensive LoRaWAN‚Ñ¢-based IoT security solution utilised by Smart Parks that is now being deployed throughout Mkomazi National Park and many other locations. . . Smart Parks has installed its fourth and largest African smart park to date in Malawi's Liwonde National Park in October 2018. In just two weeks, the 548km2 national park was equipped with gateways and sensors that gather information to help improve park management and protection. The construction of the network in the Liwonde National Park was implemented alongside a team from African Parks, a conservation NGO that manages the park on behalf of the Malawian government.

Of rare books designated by the National Library of Serbia, Inok Sava's Prvi srpski bukvar (First Serbian Spelling Book by Inok Sava) is considered among the rarest. The first Serbian book to be published in Cyrillic to teach children the ABC was a primer called Bukvar. The Alphabet (Bukvar), printed at the Giovanni Antonio Rampazzetto Press in Venice in two editions in 1597, was composed by Inok Sava under the patronage of Stefan Pa≈°troviƒá. There was an earlier –ê–∑–±—É–∫–∞ or –ß–∏—Ç–∞–Ω–∫–∞ (ABC (Reader)), the first Ruthenian language textbook, printed by Ivan Fyodorov in 1574. The primer featured the Old Church Slavonic or so-called Cyrillic alphabet as well. Biography Inok Sava was a contemporary of printer Ivan Fyodorov, who published the Russian Primer in Lviv, Imperial Russia, in 1574 and another Primer four years later (1578) in Ostrog, Crown of the Kingdom of Poland. Printing came late to Zeta (Montenegro), the first Montenegrin printed books ‚Äì Cetinje Octoechos‚Äîappearing in 1494 some 55 years after Johannes Gutenberg printed the Bible on his newly-invented, mechanical movable type in 1439. Following the invasions of Serbian lands, leaders began to think of the needs of the people living in the conquered territories, and ordered churches and monasteries of worship and learning to be built and books to be provided for them. Most of the available manuscript copies of books were riddled with copyists' errors. Hieromonk Stefan Pa≈°troviƒá came to the idea to have the manuscripts corrected and printed into books like those which exist in northern Venice. He set out to find his relative Inok Sava, a monk at Visoki Deƒçani, and to send him on that mission. We know little about Inok Sava except that he was born in Pa≈°troviƒái and was associated with Visoki Deƒçani as a travelling monk, a gatherer of alms, milostinja in Serbian. Such a monk was usually referred to as putnik, meaning traveller. Inok Sava was well educated and familiar with Ivan Fyodorov's work. He also had the good fortune to improve on Fyodorov's primer. The first page of the syllabary has the Serbian alphabet, followed by vowels, then the syllables, the names of all the letters, etc. The syllabary of Inok Sava originates from the time when very few European countries and cultures possessed their own teaching aids for school children. The syllabary fascinates the most with its teaching methods because it was the first in Europe to have applied the principle of phonetic reading. However, this syllabary remained neglected and somewhat forgotten. Meanwhile, the Serbs learned literacy from imported books, either published in Imperial Russia or the territories belonging to the Holy Roman Empire, as the Austrian Empire was once called. These Serbian primers were based on Old Church Slavonic and Slavonic-Serbian, a common language of all the South Slavic people of the Balkans. By the 19th century, the Inok Sava Bukvar was known to only a few academics at the time. It's not surprising because the Age of Enlightenment had initiated new primers such as the Bukvar by Gavrilo Stefanoviƒá Vencloviƒá, 1717; Pervoe uƒçenie (First Beginners) by Zaharije Orfelin, 1767; Pervoe uƒçenie by Theophan Prokopovich was brought from Russia to Serbia in 1724 through the auspices of Mojsije Petroviƒá of the Metropolitanate of Karlovci; Bukvar by Joseph Kurzb√∂ck, printed in Vienna in 1770; Bukvar by Teodor Jankoviƒá Mirijevski, 1776) and newer methods of learning. In 1893 the Russian consul in Shkoder, Krilov, gave the first edition, printed in Venice on 20 May 1597, as a gift to Serbian journalist Okica Glu≈°ƒçeviƒá, who was translating Leo Tolstoy's \\"War and Peace\\" at the time. Later, in 1921, Milorad Dimitrijeviƒá, a Belgrade engineer, bought the second edition, published on 25 May 1597, in Dubrovnik, where he was on a trip. Both editions, the first and the second, were presented to the National Library of Serbia. The first edition consisting of only two sheets of paper, of which we only have a copy today, was burned in the German bombing of Belgrade and the National Library on April 6, 1941, and second edition, on four sheets, is fortunately preserved.

The Ka-25 helicopter that could be landed on the destroyer was also capable of aiding in the search and destruction of submarines. = Sensors and electronic warfare = As a ship of the second series of her class, Sposobny was equipped with more advanced sensors. Instead of the two MR-300 search radars of the first series, she received an MR-310 Angara on her foremast and an MR-500U Kliver on the mainmast. She differed from the earlier members of her series in being equipped with two more advanced Volga navigational radars on the foremast instead of a single Don radar. The destroyer was equipped with MG-312 Titan and MG-311 Vychegda sonar. For fire control, Sposobny received the Yatagan guidance radar for her Volna, the Turel for her AK-726, and the Groza for her torpedoes. Sposobny also had a MG-26 communications outfit, a Triton transceiver, the MPP-315 remote indicator for her Volga, and the Nikel-KM identification friend or foe system. For electronic warfare she was equipped with the MRP 13‚Äì14 direction finding system.  Construction and service  Built in the 61 Communards Shipyard in Nikolayev with the serial number 1713, the destroyer was laid down on 10 March 1969, launched on 11 April 1970, and completed on 25 September 1971. Sposobny was added to the Navy List on 25 April 1970. = 1970s = Assigned to the Pacific Fleet on 27 October, she departed Sevastopol under the command of Captain 3rd rank G. Kudryavtsev on 15 February 1972. After passing the Cape of Good Hope she reached the Pacific Fleet base at Vladivostok on 26 August and joined the 175th Missile Ship Brigade of the fleet's 10th (Pacific) Operational Squadron. Between 17 and 24 December 1973, as part of a detachment of the fleet with command ship Admiral Senyavin and a Project 641 submarine, under the flag of First Deputy Commander of the Pacific Fleet Kontr-admiral Vladimir Maslov, the destroyer visited Port Louis, Mauritius. On the return voyage Admiral Senyavin and Sposobny visited Bombay between 9 and 15 February 1974. As part of a fleet detachment with Gnevny and the tanker Ilim under the flag of squadron commander Kontr-admiral Vladimir Varganov, she visited Vancouver, Canada from 25 to 30 August 1976, being open to public viewing. The visit was part of an exchange program that was reciprocated by the visit of Canadian warships to Leningrad later that year, although anti-whaling and anti-Soviet demonstrations were made against the ships; the visit was the first since 1944. With a detachment of warships and in cooperation with anti-submarine aircraft she participated in anti- submarine exercises on 26 August 1977. Alongside Admiral Senyavin, the cruisers Vasily Chapayev and Admiral Fokin, destroyers Strogy and Bozbuzhdenny, and the frigate Razyashchy, she supported Vietnam during the Sino-Vietnamese War between February and March 1979. Operating in the South China Sea, the ships intercepted Chinese battlefield communications and passed them on to Vietnamese forces. = 1980s and end of service = Transferred to the 201st Anti-Submarine Warfare Brigade in 1982, Sposobny twice operated in the Sea of Japan that year, tracking American ships. Between 9 and 13 June 1983, with a fleet detachment of the 8th (Indian Ocean) Operational Squadron that also included the frigate Grozyashchy and the tanker Pechenga under the flag of squadron commander Kontr-admiral Gennady Semyonov, she made an official visit to Colombo, Sri Lanka. The destroyer operated in the South China Sea and Indian Ocean in 1985, receiving an excellent rating for her performance. On 16 July 1987, she was temporarily transferred to the Black Sea Fleet and on 30 July delivered to the Sevastopol Marine Plant for repairs and modernization as prototype for Project 01090 prior to transfer to the Northern Fleet. As the work began, the design for the modernization was changed to Project 01091. The modernization was to be completed by 30 September 1989, and differed only from the Project 01090 modernization of her sister ship Smetlivy in that she was to receive experimental nonacoustic submarine detection equipment instead of the Kaira sonar that Smetlivy was given. To provide space for the equipment the aft gun turret was to be removed and the complex was to be installed at the stern helicopter pad, with two sponsons for lowering towed antennas. The modernization was 70% complete by the fall of the Soviet Union. Due to the fall of the Soviet Union, the modernization was not completed, and on 29 October 1992 the transfer to the Black Sea Fleet was made permanent. This followed an unsuccessful Ukrainian attempt to raise the Ukrainian flag over the ship on 3 July after the crew took the oath of allegiance to Ukraine; the ship remained under Russian control. She was removed from the Navy list on 6 January 1993, and to pay off the navy's debts to the shipyard she was transferred to the ownership of the Sevastopol Marine Plant. Relocated from the North Dock to Yuzhnaya Bay to remove weapons and equipment, she was stripped by 20 November, when the crew was disbanded and the ship became property of the plant. The hull was sold to an Indian company for scrapping and was towed away from Sevastopol on 2 April 1995. During her career, Sposobny was assigned the temporary tactical numbers 522 (in 1971), 109 (in 1973), 547 (in 1982), 544 (in 1982), and 578 (in 1987).

Kelsall was the son of Henry Kelsall of Chester. He was educated at Westminster School under Knipe, where he was a school-fellow of Thomas Holles, the future Duke of Newcastle. He was admitted at Trinity College, Cambridge on 7 February 1708, aged 15 and became a fellow in 1714. Kelsall was appointed Senior clerk at the Treasury under William Lowndes in November 1714. This was presumably through the influence of Newcastle, and he retained the post for the rest of his life. Newcastle was probably also instrumental in his return as Member of Parliament for Chichester at a by-election on 3 December 1719. At the 1722 general election, the Government brought him in as MP for Bossiney. After Lowndes death in 1724, he was second in command at the Treasury to John Scrope. He served on the House of Commons committees that were responsible for drawing up the finance bills each session. At the 1727 general election, he was returned as MP for Mitchell. He did not stand in 1734 but was appointed a commissioner of land taxes in 1735. He still retained his Treasury post. On 27 May 1736, he became a Fellow of the Royal Society. In June 1761 he tried to sell his position as commissioner of taxes but Newcastle refused to allow it. Kelsall applied to Newcastle for a small pension for his daughter on 1 February 1762, shortly before his death and it was subsequently granted. He died on 10 February 1762.

It has been described as 'solid state', as there are no moving parts in the propulsion system; all thrust is powered by the phenomenon known as ion wind. It is being developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics by engineer Stephen Barrett (associate professor of aeronautics and astronautics) and others. It is claimed to be the first ion-propelled airplane. Ion-propelled aircraft without wings have existed since the 1960s. Design and development The aircraft is a flying wing made of very light materials, including carbon-fibre, shrink- wrap plastic, balsa wood, polystyrene, and Kevlar. It has a very wide open frame serving as a fuselage, in and below which thin wires are strung horizontally. The aircraft weighs just over and has a wingspan of . The MIT engineers were able fine tune the aircraft to find the best design and power requirement by employing a technique known as geometric programming. It can fly at around . =Propulsion= The aircraft is an example of an ionocraft, which is powered by an ionic wind generated through controlled electrical discharge. The fuselage contains a stack of 54 lithium-polymer batteries. With the aid of a power supply unit these deliver a minimum of 20,000 volts of electrical potential, producing enough corona discharge to propel the aircraft. Air at the front of the wing is ionized by an electrical field near thin filaments of wire called emitters. Elsewhere on the airframe, collectors attract these positively charged ions. As the ions travel toward the collectors, they collide with air molecules. Energy is transferred from the ions to the air molecules, thereby producing air flow; the thrust propels the aircraft forwards, fast enough to gain flying speed, with the conventional wings providing aerodynamic lift. Operational history The aircraft has flown at least eleven times, in the duPont Athletic Center, an indoor gymnasium on the MIT campus. The flight distances have been constrained by the long space within the gymnasium, and the aircraft normally flies about off the ground.

It is located at a distance of circa 80 million light years from Earth, which, given its apparent dimensions, means that NGC 5322 is about 140,000 light years across. It was discovered by William Herschel on March 19, 1790. The galaxy has been found to possess an inner stellar disc and an edge-on nuclear dust disc across the centre, aligned along the major-axis of the galaxy. The stellar disk counter-rotates the galaxy with respect to the spheroid and is believed to be the remnant of a gas-rich satellite. The spheroid has a boxy shape. The galaxy also has an outer halo. In the centre of the galaxy is predicted to lie a supermassive black hole with mass 108.51 ¬±0.40 (129-813 million) . Observed in radio waves, NGC 5322 is a weak source and features two symmetric jets emanating from the galactic core and having a linear length of 1.6 kpc. The two jets are nearly perpendicular to the major axis of the galaxy and the circumnuclear dust disk. NGC 5322 is thought to contain a low- luminosity Active galactic nucleus (AGN), powered by the accretion of gaseous material. The AGN then creates the radio jets.

Biography  He came from a family that included a long line of decorative painters, originating in Bedigliora. His father, Francesco (1837‚Äì1914), followed in the family tradition as well as being a master builder. His mother, Katharina Steinbrecher (1838‚Äì1925) was a native of Stuttgart. He attended school in Z√ºrich. On the advice of Ottilie Roederstein, he left immediately after graduating (in 1888), and went to Paris, where he enrolled at the Acad√©mie Colarossi. His first instructor was Jean-Andr√© Rixens. While there, he met and became engaged to a fellow student, Constance Macpherson (1871‚Äì1957), from England. They were married in 1893. After stays in Italy and Ticino, they moved to Z√ºrich. Their daughter Katharina (1894-1973), would later marry the painter and give birth to , who would also become a painter. Free from pressing financial obligations, he devoted himself entirely to his work. In 1898, he moved into a new studio, built by his father, where he produced still-lifes, portraits and nudes. He also worked in plein aire for a time, when he was flirting with impressionism. Later, he travelled extensively, visiting the Low Countries in 1903 and England in 1910. In 1904, he began to experiment with brighter patches of color; perhaps influenced by C√©zanne and the Fauvists or his friends Giovanni Giacometti and Cuno Amiet. He showed his work at numerous exhibitions until around 1920, when he stopped painting to focus on his membership and executive positions in numerous art associations. During this time, he still did colored pencil drawings while otherwise unoccupied. After 1915, he was a member of the Federal Art Commission and served as its Vice-President from 1923 until his death. He was an indefatigable promoter of modern art in every position he held.Rudolf Koella: Sigismund Righini, Maler, Zeichner, Kunstpolitiker. Offizin Verlag, Z√ºrich 1993, S. 119.

There is also a significant population of Lurs in eastern and central parts of Iraq The word Luristan or Lorestan, is attributed to the areas inhabited by the Lurs. The boundaries of Luristan stretch from the eastern Iraqi plains to the west and southwest of Iran.Minorsky, V. Articles \\"Lur\\" and \\"Luristan\\" in Encyclopedia of Islam Today, Lorestan is the name of one of the western provinces of Iran.  Origin  There are several disputes over the origin of the Lurs and they are believed to be from the Elamite and Kassite origin or a Median or Persian tribe of Aryan origin. = Name = The first sighting of the word Lur is in the writings of some historians and geographers of the 10th century and later in the form of ÿßŸÑŸÑŸàÿ±, ÿßŸÑŸÑÿ± and ŸÑŸàÿ± (Lur). Hamdallah Mustawfi in Tarikh-e gozida (1330 AD) referred to the settlement of Luri tribes in Levant and then their mass migration towards the current Luri- inhabited areas. There are several hypotheses that discuss the origin of the name Lur or Lor, prominent amongst them is its attribution to a person called Lur or Lohraseb and some believe that the name refers to the area of first settlement of this ethnic group. The word Ler or Lir (literally forest or forest mountain) is a probable source for this word.H.Mostawfi. 2000. Tarikhe Gozide (in Persian). Amir Kabir Publications, Tehran  Early History  Cave painting in Doushe cave, Lorestan, Iran, 8th millennium BC Zoom of a disc- headed pin (pin, female figure). Found in Lorestan, Rietberg Museum, Z√ºrich The ancient history of Lorestan is closely intertwined with the rest of the Ancient Near East. In the 3rd and 4th millennium BC, migrant tribes settled down in the mountainous area of the Zagros Mountains. The Kassites, an ancient people who spoke neither an Indo-European nor a Semitic language, originated from Lorestan. They would control Babylonia after the fall of the Old Babylonian Empire ca. 1531 BC and until ca. 1155 BC. Iranian Medes invaded and settled in Luristan in the 2nd millennium BC. The Medes assimilated the indigenous inhabitants of the region, primarily the Kassites as well as the Gutians, by the time the area was conquered by the Persians in the 1st millennium BC. In February 2017, archeological discoveries related to the Achaemenid era were made in Lorestan for the first time. = Elam = The first people who ruled areas of Lorestan were Elamites. The extent of the influence of the Elamites has been to the present Mamassani area. They were indigenous peoples of Iran, but there is no proper knowledge of how communities are formed and the beginning of their history. They were able to establish a state before the arrival of Aryan ethnic groups in parts of western Iran. The Elam government included Khuzestan, modern Lorestan, Poshtkuh (Ilam province and some western Iraqi areas), Bakhtiari mountains and Southern Luri settlement. Babylonians called the land of Elamites Elam or Elamto, meaning \\"the mountain\\" and perhaps \\"the land of sunrise\\". Elamite is generally accepted to be a language isolate and thus unrelated to the much later-arriving Persian and Iranic languages. In relation to geographical and archaeological matching, historians argue that the Elamites to be the Proto- Lurs, whose language became Iranian only in the Middle Ages. = Kassites = Kassites entered to the Iranian plateau from the highlands of the Caucasus and Azerbaijan before the Aryan migration and then settled the southwest of Iran. Kassites along with Elam, dominated parts of Lorestan and had an extraordinary skill in making bronze artifacts. They were considered as the most important Zagros mountain tribes and were engaged to livestock breeding. They spoke in a language that was affiliated with Elamite. They were warrior riders who repeatedly entered into battle with their neighbors, including Elamites and Babylonians. They overthrew the government of Babylon and ruled the Babylon for six centuries. The rule of the Kassites in Babylonia ended as a result of their defeat from the Elamites. After the defeat from the Elamites, they returned to their mountainous land of Lorestan. = Achaemenids to Sassanids = During the rule of Achaemenid, Lorestan was part of the rule of the Kassites and when the Achaemenids moved from Babylon to Hamadan, they had to cross the Lorestan area and pay ransom to the Kassites. Pahle was the name of a vast land in west of Iran which was included many cities and areas in the current Zagros. The province of Pahla was named after the Sasanian times and the word Pahlavi refers to the people, the language, and the alphabet related to this region. At the time of the Achaemenids, the current Lorestan, along with Ilam and Khuzestan, were the third state of this great empire. During the Parthian period, this land was one of the Satraps (states) of this dynasty and finally, during the Sassanid period, the area was named \\"Pahla\\".

A native of Lorraine, France, a young merchant of antebellum New Orleans, pioneer of the California gold rush, and, finally, an international banker by the end of the nineteenth century, Simon Lazard with his brothers in Lazard Freres had built high-level financial relationships in business and government within a network encompassing France, England, and the U.S. Biography Family Simon Lazard was born to a Jewish family on April 8, 1828, in Frauenberg, Moselle, Lorraine, in northeast France. He was the son of Elie Lazard (1796-1831), a farmer, and Esther (n√©e Aron, 1798 -1875). His father died when he was three, and his mother was remarried to Mo√Øse Cahn (1796-1872), also of Frauenberg. He was the fifth oldest of the household‚Äôs eleven children, seven fathered by Elie and four by Mo√Øse, a close-knit family. Note: In early American newspapers, for the younger half-brother and half-sister Cahn siblings, the name Cahn Lazard was sometimes used, recognition of a connection to their elder Lazard half-siblings. That name is used here. New Orleans In 1844, at the age 16, he moved to New Orleans where his older brothers Lazare (1821-1875) and Alexandre (1823-1904) had previously moved following an uncle. They were soon joined by their brothers Maurice (1825-1891) and Elie (1831-1897). New Orleans in the early 1840s was the United States' third- largest city, the trade hub for the South, and had the largest concentration of French language speakers. The brothers, all in their teens and early twenties, opened Lazard Fr√®res & Co. at Poydras and Carondelet Streets, a few blocks from the Mississippi River landing, a small shop that offered fancy and staple dry goods, for ‚Äúa very small profit.‚Äù Simon and his brothers signed a partnership agreement for ‚ÄúLazard Fr√®res‚Äù on July 12, 1848, the birth certificate of today‚Äôs multi-national Lazard, the world‚Äôs largest independent investment bank. California Gold Rush In late 1848, news of the California gold discovery swept up the brothers. The oldest, Lazare, left New Orleans first, in 1849. On January 16, 1850, Simon boarded the steamship Falcon bound for California via Chagres, the Isthmus of Panama, and the Pacific Coast. Maurice and Elie followed after the summer sales, announcing to the press their planned ‚Äútemporary absence,‚Äù and the purchase of 200 barrels of Kentucky whiskey for the San Francisco market. (Elie's name shows on the July 25, 1850, census of New Orleans and the October 10, 1850, census at Sacramento as a clerk with cousin Maurice Kremer, suggesting a quick transfer to the gold fields). While Simon set up shop in booming San Francisco‚Äôs waterfront, Alexandre made a quick buying trip to England and France, an annual event after moving to California, the standard process for the brothers during their 1850s merchant business ‚Äî one of the brothers on extended, annual buying trips to New York or Europe, while the other brothers operated the thriving business. During its first years, Lazard Fr√®res & Co. moved frequently. Their first store was destroyed in San Francisco‚Äôs catastrophic May 1851 fire, then to Montgomery and Pine Streets, followed by Maynard‚Äôs Row on California Street, in 1855 to 64 Sacramento Street, and subsequently to 215-217 Battery. In the 1860s, they moved into their own building, a grand store at 525-527 Market Street, which was a multi-story structure with sales rooms below and office above. The firm specialized in drygoods, from worker‚Äôs boots and trousers to fancy French goods, including linens, wine and champagne. They wholesaled goods to miningcamp traders, while also serving as agents for European firms, selling goods in the booming California market. (San Francisco had grown from 459 people in 1847 to an estimated 50,000 by 1856.) In this instant city, Lazard Fr√®res became one of the biggest retailers and wholesalers of English and French made goods, while Simon handled money trading and banking, a growing but informal part of the business. Gold Exchange and Expanding Business From the first they dealt in gold dust, in exchange for goods to miners, then as separate purchase of precious metal bullion (or, in reality, a crude dore bar), which they shipped back to France for assay and sales. Beginning with a shipment in March 1851 of $5,000 in nuggets and dust, by 1853 they had shipped over a quarter-million dollars worth of precious metals. Simon‚Äôs initial trade-dust and bullion business expanded to include currency exchanges and banknotes. Profits from these activities were funneled into real estate investments, offerings of loans and mortgages, and other businesses, part of what had become a bank in all but name. About 1860, looking for new business opportunities, Simon purchased a part of the Mission Woolen Mills and, later, the Pacific Woolen Mills, which profited from government contracts especially during the Civil War. Simon, or rather Lazard Fr√®res & Co., expanded its investments, especially after the 1859 silver discovery of the Comstock Lode in Nevada. With Joseph Aron, Elie and Simon managed silver-bullion shipments between California and Paris and helped finance the Sutro Tunnel Company to bore four miles into the hill below the lode. Aron served as the tunnel-company president before moving to New York City in 1876. The firm also loaned funds to operations and became part owners, usually through mortgage foreclosures of mining properties, including the Brunswick mine on the lode and the rich Raymond & Ely silver mine at Pioche, Nevada. These sometimes risky speculations continuously caused rifts among the more conservative brothers and their extended family. Humanitarian Activities Simon was also active in the wider social and political movements. In October 1850, he joined with 12 other young men to form San Francisco‚Äôs Eureka Benevolent Society. They provided funds and help with those who might be in want. During the early years, antiforeigner sentiment was felt for non- English speakers and as tensions rose some anti-French violence was threatened. Civil law calmed the situation, but, in 1851, Simon with his multi-lingual brothers became American citizens, he said that it was \\"a mere formality, but the law required me.‚Äù Simon became active in the People‚Äôs Reform Party, organized to expose fraud in local government, cut taxes, and expand the liberal vote. He also was active later in the French Benevolent Society of California. Lazard Fr√®res also donated funds to an odd mix of causes: the Polish independence movement, the National Sanitary Fund of the Civil War era, a Jewish child threatened by Italian priests in Rome, and a national French Patriotism movement of the Franco-Prussian War era. In 1871, when those in San Franciscans raised funds to aid the victims of the Franco- Prussian war in France, they sent the 112,000 francs to Simon to distribute. Family in America As the dry goods business grew, more help was needed and younger members of the family were brought from France to San Francisco. During the 1850s and early 1860s, younger half-brothers Simon Sylvain Cahn Lazard (1837-1871) and David Cahn Lazard (1843-1916) became salesmen, clerks, or bookkeepers, while cousins :fr:Alexandre Weill (banquier) and Henri Weill, and Maurice Kremer and Solomon Lazard (before they opened their own store in 1852 Los Angeles) worked for the firm. (Cousins Alexandre and Henri‚Äôs sister, Esther Weill, married Lazard brother Maurice; Alexandre Weill strengthened his bond to the Lazards by marrying their youngest sister, Julie Cahn Lazard, in 1867). The brothers Lazard also helped with their brother-in-law Theodore Weill‚Äôs tobacco-importing firm (sister Lisa [1826-1908] was his wife, and half-sister Adelaide Cahn Lazard [1838-1892] married his partner, Joseph Aron, who was the later Sutro tunnel project president). The closeness of the Lazard-Cahn-Weill-Aron family and primogenitor laws has been pointed to as one of the financial and social strengths of the Lazard Fr√®res firm in the nineteenth century. Lazard Fr√®res, International Bankers The Lazard brothers came to California with the intention of working, saving, and returning home after becoming rich, a motive widely shared by immigrants of all backgrounds. With the infusion of younger talent at the same time the international business continued to grow, the Lazards decided to permanently return home and establish headquarters in Paris. A July 20, 1858, agreement established Lazard Fr√®res et Cie. Alexandre, Maurice and Lazare had already moved back to Paris. In 1861, after the completion of the transcontinental telegraph to San Francisco improved communication, thirty-three-year-old Simon left permanently for Paris; brother Elie followed five years later. Close brother-in-law Alexandre Weill and the youngest brothers, S. Sylvain and David Cahn Lazard, tutored by Simon and Elie, remained in San Francisco as partners and local managers. Alexandre Weill and brother-in-law David Cahn Lazard would become leaders of the American offices of Lazard Fr√®res & Co. with the departure of the older Lazard brothers (the popular S. Sylvain Cahn Lazard had died of typhoid in San Francisco in July 1871). With the establishment of Lazard Fr√®res import-export offices in New York City and London during the 1870s, the firm became truly multinational. Simon and his brothers held the partner shares of the new offices. In 1876, Lazard Fr√®res, after continuing to move towards the banking business, decided to take advantage of the turmoil, caused by the Panic of 1873 and the collapse of several California banks, to focus on banking. Simon returned to San Francisco to liquidate the drygoods business and reopened Lazard Fr√®res & Co. as bankers at 205 Sansome Street in the financial district of San Francisco. By the 1880s, the Lazard Fr√®res offices in Paris, London, New York, and San Francisco, managed by family members, became one of the strongest international commercial and investment banks. In 1887, Simon called David Cahn Lazard back to Paris to help manage from afar the California business. David Cahn was the last sibling of the Lazard brothers to leave America. Previously, in 1884, Simon had organized the London, Paris, and American Bank Ltd with Elie and with him on the board of directors. It took over the bank business in San Francisco. With David‚Äôs departure, Simon and Alexandre selected Marc Eugene Meyer, the first non- Lazard family member, to be in charge of the bank and Lazard Fr√®res & Co.‚Äôs San Francisco office. Meyer, cousin of Alexandre Weill, was hired by Simon in 1859 as a stockboy at the San Francisco store, before he went out on his own in Los Angeles. Courted back to Lazard Fr√®res, he expanded banking operations in the West. By the 1890s, Meyer followed Alexandre Weill‚Äôs career track to the New York City office as the Wall Street operation eclipsed those in San Francisco. In coordination with the Paris and London offices and assisted by George Blumenthal (banker), he shaped Lazard Fr√®res New York as a major speculator in railroad and utilities stocks and bonds as well as mastered the securities and precious-metals markets including sensational gold shipments to France. One newspaper commentator noted, Lazard Fr√®res ‚Äúused to buy lots of silver bullion in San Francisco. They deal in the yellow metal in New York.‚Äù He added: ‚ÄúThe sensations in Wall Street by these old Pacific coasters is in the matter of gold shipments ‚Äî the bane of the stock bulls.‚Äù Importantly, Lazard Fr√®res & Co. were to orchestrate a financial empire that specialized in sending millions of dollars worth of gold and silver bullion from New York City to bolster France‚Äôs currency during the economic fluctuations of the 1880s and 1890s, while also profiting from the higher goldmarket prices paid in Europe. This arbitrage business expanded after the 1882 Paris Bourse crisis. In Paris, Simon served as the American representative for the Banque de France. During the American financial Panic of 1893, he, Weill, the Lazard Fr√®res et Cie, with the Lazard Freres & Co. New York office, Meyer and George Blumenthal (banker), coordinated with American banker J.P. Morgan to ship gold across the Atlantic to replenish the U.S. Treasury‚Äôs declining gold supply. The infusion saved the U.S. Treasury. Legacy In fin de si√®cle Paris, Simon Lazard was the patriarch of Lazard Fr√®res. The firm became known as one of ‚Äúthe greatest banking concerns of the world.‚Äù With his death in 1898, the San Francisco Chronicle remembered Simon Lazard among Californians and stated that he was ‚Äùhighly esteemed by a large circle of friends on both continents for his liberal views, business ability and his lavish charities.‚Äù Native of Lorraine, France, merchant of antebellum New Orleans, pioneer of the California gold rush, and, finally, international banker, Simon Lazard left an enduring legacy. Personal Life In 1867, Simon Lazard married Eve Rose H√©l√®ne Foy (1846-1915) and was the father of six children, including Lazard Fr√®res banker Andr√© Lazard, an economist and sociologist :fr:Max Lazard and Esther Lazard Fould, married to French industrialist :fr:Ren√© Fould. He died at his home at 48 rue des Belles Feuilles in Paris, February 24, 1898.

The work was a gift to the capital of the entrepreneur, Antonio Escand√≥n, a member of a wealthy, conservative Mexican family and who had supported Emperor Maximilian, built the Mexico City- Veracruz railway with the help of French investments and British engineers.Oscar E.

The statue was inaugurated almost immediately after liberal General Porfirio D√≠az seized the presidency in 1876.

On October 12, 1992, on the occasion of the 500 year anniversary of Columbus' voyage of discovery to America, a series of protests were held in different cities of Mexico. In Mexico City the monument was defaced after a protest lead by indigenous groups, unions and punk collectives. The protesters tried to toppling the Colombus sculpture attaching ropes to a Ruta 100 public transport bus but the attempt was frustrated by the Mexico City Police Grenadier Corps. In later demonstrations, the monument was protected in different ways to prevent the toppling of Colombus sculpture. Based on postcolonial and anti-racist arguments in the first decade of the 21th century and after the remotion of monuments after George Floyd protests, social groups in America began the toppling of sculptures and monuments of British and Spanish conquerors or colonizers. In Mexico City, a demonstration was called on October 12, 2020 to toppling the Colombus sculpture. However, on 10 October 2020 Government of Mexico City removed the Reforma sculpture from the monument, arguing a previously scheduled restoration by the National Institute of Anthropology and History. The demonstation moved instead to the monument located in Buenavista. Description Detail showing Columbus lifting a veil from the globe Paseo de la Reforma On the monument's pedestal are two bas-reliefs, one depicting showing Christopher Columbus's arrival in the New World and the other, the construction of a church. On the corners of the pedestal are statues of friars, depicted in a seated position, said to be those who were important to the early history of Mexico including Franciscan Pedro de Gante, the first to evangelize Mexico's indigenous population, and Dominican Bartolom√© de las Casas; and Antonio de Marchena and Diego de Deza, who aided Columbus in Spain.

In Mexico, where anticlericalism and suppression of the power of the Catholic Church had embroiled Mexico in a civil war and a foreign intervention during the nineteenth-century liberal Reform, the Columbus statue's combination of religious iconography and symbolic embodiment of European conquest and domination, has made the statue a target of protesters.Groseclose, \\"Monuments and Memorials\\", p.481.

The United Nations Council on Trade and Development characterizes geared ships as a \\"niche market only appropriate for those ports where low cargo volumes do not justify investment in port cranes or where the public sector does not have the financial resources for such investment.\\" Construction of the ship was completed in 1999. , the ship is classified by Det Norske Veritas with the code \\"100 A5 E General cargo ship with double hull Equipped for carriage of containers SOLAS-II-2, Reg.19\\", meaning that it was constructed under the supervision of a recognized classification society, that the construction complies with the society's rules, that it is classed as a general cargo carrier and container ship, and that it is designed to be operated with unattended machinery spaces.The code is given at the DNV Exchange, and explained on Det Norske Veritas, January 2011, pp. 5, 18.

The tall stone structure was constructed by the Sykes family of Sledmere. Engraved monumental brasses were added after the First World War, converting the cross into a war memorial. Village cross The high cross was commissioned by Sir Tatton Sykes, 5th Baronet (1826‚Äì1913). His wealthy merchant family had moved to Sledmere in the early 18th century and resided at Sledmere House. Eleanor cross, Hardingstone The cross was designed by the architect Temple Lushington Moore, as a village cross, closely modelled on the 13th-century Eleanor cross at Hardingstone, Northamptonshire, with two square tiers on two octagonal tiers, standing on a base with eight steps and a plinth that is inscribed with the words of the Lord's Prayer. It was built from limestone ashlars by the stonemasons Thompsons of Peterborough, with ornamental carving by John Barker of Kennington, and erected at the west side of the village, near the Church of St Mary, part of the Sykes Churches Trail. The first tier has blind tracery panels separated by pillars with pinnacles, standing on a moulded base, with sixteen carved heraldic shields, representing the arms of England, Kingston upon Hull, Beverley, the Holy Trinity, the See of York, Archbishop William Maclagan, a Gallic cock, and the arms of families related to the Sykes family. Between the first and second tier is a band with carved flowers and animals. The second tier has four canopied open niches, each containing a different statue of Queen Eleanor designed by Moore; traces remain to indicate that these statues were originally painted. The third stage has four blind tracery panels. The fourth tier of the cross in Hardingstone has been missing for many centuries, so Moore created his own design for the top tier of the cross in Sledmere, with four closed niches each housing a statue of the Virgin Mary. The cross is topped by a stone pinnacle and a jewelled bronze crucifix. War memorial The cross was redesigned as a war memorial in 1918 by Lt Col Sir Mark Sykes, 6th Baronet, to commemorate fallen officers of the 5th Battalion Yorkshire Regiment, the fallen from the Sledmere estate, and two other soldiers known to him, one who served in the 1st Battalion Cheshire Regiment and the other in Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry. Sykes added a bronze crucifix, and 22 engraved monumental brasses of the fallen soldiers made by Gawthorp and Sons of London. Some of the soldiers wear modern uniforms, but others (especially the officers) are in a 14th-century or Gothic Revival style, often presenting the soldiers as knights or with chivalric references. The brasses were installed over a period of time from 1918 onwards, with separate unveiling ceremonies, ultimately filling in seven of the eight blind panels on the first tier of the cross, with one panel left vacant. They vary in size and presentation, with one panel containing six in three rows of two, and others containing one, two or three full-length figures. Sykes attended the Paris Peace Conference in 1919 as an expert on the Middle East, as he was a signatory to the 1916 Sykes‚ÄìPicot Agreement, but he contracted Spanish flu and died in Paris in February 1919. The villagers of Sledmere commissioned one further figure of Sykes to fill the remaining eighth panel, depicting him as a knight with a shield bearing the Sykes arms and a scroll with the words \\"LAETARE JERUSALEM\\" (\\"Rejoice, Jerusalem\\"). The figure of Sykes was unveiled on 3 April 1921 at the same time as the last of the other brasses, at a ceremony attended by a guard of honour from the 5th Battalion, Green Howards, with which Sykes served in the Second Boer War and of which Sykes was the commanding officer when the First World War broke out in 1914. The ceremony was attended by veterans from the 5th Battalion Yorkshire Regiment, and members of the Sykes family, including Mark's widow. The figure of Sykes was unveiled by Father Oswald Smith, Abbot of Ampleforth Abbey; that of Lt Col James Albert Raymond Thomson, commander of the 5th Battalion in 1918, was unveiled by Colonel Commandant George Dominic Price DSO. It bears an inscription: \\"THE NAMES INSCRIBED / ON THIS MEMORIAL ARE THOSE / OF OFFICERS AND MEN / OF THE 5 YORKSHIRE REGT / WHO GAVE THEIR LIVES / FOR THEIR KING AND / COUNTRY & THE LIBERTIES / OF MANKIND IN THE YEARS / OF THE GREAT WAR/LET YORKSHIRE MEN / CHERISH THE MEMORIAL/OF THIS HONOURABLE / COMPANY OF CITIZENS / WHO LEFT THEIR PEACE / (...) TO / UPHOLD JUSTICE PROTECT / THE WEAK AND DEFEND / THE RIGHT\\"; and then lists 24 names. The cross was listed at Grade II in 1966, upgraded to Grade I in 2016. Other local memorials The Grade I listed Wagoners' Memorial, designed by Sir Mark Sykes, stands nearby. Some miles away at Cowlam is a tall stone memorial to Sir Tatton Sykes, 4th Baronet.

Biography He was born in Bitola. It is stated that his origin was Serb. He grew up in the inner mehter of Kara Ibrahim Pasha. When Kara Ibrahim Pasha was the Grand Vizier in 1684, he was a member of the Imperial Council. He was then appointed as djebedji and in 1691 became Agha of the Janissaries. He was promoted to Vizier and appointed to the Babadaƒü guard. He was appointed to the governorship of the Anatolia Eyalet in 1695, and in 1696 to the Diyarbakƒ±r Eyalet. During his campaign in Austria, he was dismissed from his Vizier position in Sofia because complains about his atrocities and exiled to Poƒçitelj, Bosnia. Upon the increase of the enemy attack on Bosnia, in 1697, his Vizier status was returned and he was appointed to the Serasker of the Bosnian Front. He repelled the enemy by succeeding in Bosnia. In 1698, he was appointed to the governorship of Raqqa. In 1699, he was assigned to the Baghdad Governorate. He took back Basra and Kurna from the rebel forces and eliminated them. Upon these achievements, he was brought back to the Anatolian Governorship. On 4 September 1702, he replaced Amcazade K√∂pr√ºl√º H√ºseyin Pasha, who left his job due to his illness. Daltaban Mustafa Pasha was appointed as the Grand Vizier with the advice of Shaykh al-IslƒÅm Feyzullah Efendi who was Sultan Mustafa II's tutor. Daltaban Mustafa Pasha had understood that he should fulfill the demands of Feyzullah Efendi in order to continue this task. Sultan Mustafa II already refused to accept his presenting Grand Vizier and divan calls and irregularities without being interviewed by the Shaykh al- IslƒÅm. He wanted each of the policies of the state and the government to implement Feyzullah Efendi's opinions and ideas for each activity he would demonstrate. Although Daltaban Mustafa Pasha is determined to go on Feyzullah Efendi's path, as he is determined to go; he was not liked by the state officials because he was a countryman and did not understand the movements and behaviors of the Istanbulites and was rough and harsh. Even the Sultan had begun to be uneasy with this rude, harsh attitude. For example, when Fethullah, the son of Feyzullah Efendi, came to the Pasha Gate, which was the workplace of the Grand Vizier, they would have taken him in front of the door; When Feyzullah came to the front of the car in front of the door to the passenger, car began to go up. Until then, according to the committees of service, Shaykh al-IslƒÅm would go on the left side of the Grand Vizier to show that he was at a lower rank; but Daltaban Mustafa Pasha began to go on the left side of Feyzullah Efendi and concluded that the Grand Vizier was at a lower rank. On the other hand, Reis √ºl-K√ºttab Rami Mehmet Pasha, who wished to be the Grand Vizier, had been working against Grand Vizier. He spread a rumor that the Grand Vizier wanted to work independently from Shaykh al-IslƒÅm and that he was trying to get support from the Janissaries and the Crimeans. Feyzullah Efendi, a control fetish, was adversely affected. With the signing of Treaty of Karlowitz; The Crimeans were forbidden to carry out the plundering strikes in Russia and the Russians were also prohibited from establishing fortifications in these borders. The Crimeans were observing that the Russians built fortifications; they had sent the news to Istanbul, but the Ottoman state decided not to do anything about this treaty violation. The Crimeans, in turn, wanted to attack the Russian border regions. The previous Grand Vizier had not accepted this, but Daltaban Mustafa Pasha was more open to the demands of the Crimeans. And he was more tolerant to the rebellious attitude of The Khan of Crimea Devlet II Giray. For this reason, he was acting slow in executing of Sultan's orders through Feyzullah Efendi to suppress the rebellion of Devlet II Giray. This behavior was considered an example of the independent movement of Daltaban Mustafa Pasha for Rami Mehmet Pasha and Feyzullah Efendi. Feyzullah Efendi, convinced the Sultan about the dismissal of Daltaban Mustafa Pasha. Daltaban Mustafa Pasha was dismissed from his post on 24 January 1703 for the crime of provoking the Crimean Khan against the Sultan. He was killed three days later.  Evaluation  Daltaban Mustafa Pasha had been successful when he was a governor and a military officer. His execution, negatively affected the military class, in particular the kapƒ±kulu soldiers. Daltaban Mustafa Pasha's accent was inaccurate and he had special expressions in the language he used. Rami Mehmet Pasha ridiculed it by creating a dictionary and it is reported to have called \\"Islahhat-ƒ± Daltaniye\\". His mouth was broken and his language used was also toxic, rude and harsh. His treatment of others was often violent and heartbreaking. Daltaban Mustafa Pasha started to implement new rules for the clothes worn by the viziers during the days of the divan. In order to show that the viziers were separate from the other state office on the divan, a rule was put on them to wear a turban called \\"kallavi\\" instead of another style of turban, called \\"m√ºcevveze\\" which they had traditionally worn for hundreds of years. \\"Zubdet Country Vekayƒ±\\" is generally 500 pouches per year for the special administration, pen and secretariat of the Grand Vizier; While Daltaban Mustafa Pasha was the Grand Vizier, he stated that the will he gathered for other bureaucratic treatments in re-assignment, re-assignment, and job change had reached 1,200 bags per year.

The Church of Old Saint-Sauveur is a former place of worship on the Place Saint-Sauveur in the old town center of Caen, France. Before the French Revolution, the church was a parish and was called just Saint-Sauveur Church. It took its current name in 1802 when the Notre-Dame-de- Froide-Rue church, which became the center of the new parish, was renamed Saint-Sauveur Church in Caen. This monument is the subject of a classification as a historical monument since June 29, 1951.Notice no PA00111140 [archive], base M√©rim√©e, minist√®re fran√ßais de la Culture The church Saint-Sauveur, probably founded at the end of the Carolingian era, is a building whose oldest parts date back to the end of the 11th century or early 12th century (for the tower in particular). It is called from 1130 St-Sauveur-du-March√©, former name of the place where it is. It is reworked several times during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. A new choir is built between 1530 and 1546 in the flamboyant Gothic style. In 1698, the cemetery surrounding the church was moved to enlarge the Place Saint-Sauveur; the place left free on the street of the Chain (current Pasteur Street) and the rue Saint-Sauveur is then invaded by houses that come to lean on the church. When the Place Saint-Sauveur was redeveloped in depth in the second half of the 18th century, the 15th century facade was destroyed and a new classical style portal was built a little further west. The floor area of the church is 754 m¬≤. The parish was part of the deanery of Caen, in the diocese of Bayeux. In February 1791 the negotiations begin between the municipality and the Directory to reorganize the parishes of Caen. It is planned to close the Saint-Sauveur church and transfer its title to the Cordeliers church. The royal ordinance of July 12, 1791 effectively closes the church, but its title is ceded to Notre-Dame de Froide-Rue, which then takes the name of Saint-Sauveur.Louis Huet, Histoire de la paroisse Saint-√âtienne de Caen : 1791-1891, √âvreux, Imprimerie de l'Eure, 1892, p. 18‚Äì19 In the 19th century, the old church, now called the Old Saint- Sauveur, is transformed into a grain market, then a butter market.

Since the end of the 1980s, it has been the subject of numerous restorations (flying buttresses, choir and lately, cross of the transept).

The actor learned from his agent that he had secured the role on his 27th birthday. He had previously made a guest appearance in the series as Azza Mason in 2015, but Colby is his first full-time television role. Franklin began filming in August 2017, and he made his first appearance during the episode broadcast on 6 February 2018. The character was introduced as a replacement for Kat Chapman (Pia Miller), who died in the season finale, and his arrival was publicised in a trailer showcasing upcoming 2018 storylines. Colby is portrayed as a stoic and loyal police constable. He had a \\"turbulent upbringing\\", and upon his arrival he was hiding a secret concerning his personal life, which was woven throughout his early storylines. Colby's introduction saw him try to break up a fight involving members of the show's River Boys surf gang. It soon emerges that he is a former gang member, and is friends with the leader Dean Thompson (Patrick O'Connor). Producers established a romantic relationship between Colby and nurse Jasmine Delaney (Sam Frost), which led to the revelation that Colby is searching for his younger sister, who was kidnapped by his violent stepfather. After Colby shoots Boyd Easton (Steve Le Marquand) while on duty, he becomes the focus of a revenge plot by Boyd's sister Ebony Harding (Cariba Heine), which culminates in Colby being poisoned and left for dead. Producers introduced the character's former fianc√©e Chelsea Campbell (Ashleigh Brewer) later that year, as well as his sister Bella Nixon (Courtney Miller). After a reconciliation and a brief break up, Colby and Chelsea marry in the 2018 season finale. For his portrayal of Colby, Franklin received a nomination for Best Soap Newcomer at the 2018 Digital Spy Reader Awards. Casting On 5 February 2018, a reporter for The Daily Telegraph confirmed that actor Tim Franklin had joined the main cast as Senior Constable Colby Thorne. His casting and character had been teased in a trailer showcasing upcoming storylines for 2018, as well as press photographs showing him filming scenes at Palm Beach, the serial's outdoor filming location. Franklin learned that he had won the role on his 27th birthday. His agent contacted him and sang \\"Happy Birthday\\" down the phone, but changed his name to Colby. Franklin admitted that he \\"screamed\\" when he realised he had the part. The actor had previously appeared in the guest role of Azza Mason in 2015, but Colby is his first full- time television role. He stated that joining the cast again was \\"so much fun\\", adding \\"I used to pretend to be a cop when I was a little kid and it's funny now I do that for a living.\\" Franklin began filming in August 2017, and he made his debut as Colby on 6 February 2018. Development=Characterisation= Colby was introduced as a replacement for fellow police constable Kat Chapman (played by Pia Miller), who died in the season finale. Franklin admitted to initially finding his character's occupation \\"daunting\\", but he found that when he puts on Colby's uniform it gives him \\"a sense of who the person is, that authoritarian role.\\" He went on to explain that Colby's uniform takes \\"a while\\" to put on due to the weight and the heavy duty belt. Franklin enjoys exploring who Colby is beyond his uniform. He also believes that Colby is \\"very gifted\\" at his job, saying \\"He has a keen eye, he isn't bad with cuffs and he's a good shot ‚Äì he'll be using these skills in the Bay!\\" Franklin added that Colby is secretly trying to solve a personal case, which he has \\"carried around since he joined the force\\". Franklin said that Colby is stoic due to his \\"turbulent upbringing\\", and he has experienced \\"a lot of trauma\\" in his life. Franklin and Colby have few similarities, but the actor found himself empathising with his character. He went onto to explain, \\"He's striving to be a better man than the example he was given. He's loyal beyond doubt, and he's always keen for a laugh ‚Äì but something from his past prevents him from truly connecting with people.\\" Colby believes that by helping the residents of Summer Bay, he might be able to forgive himself for an event that happened in his past. In October 2018, Franklin told John Burfitt of Soap World that he found it \\"very different\\" playing Colby now compared to when he first started. He thought he knew his character and his motives better, and was comfortable in his portrayal of him. =Introduction= Colby makes his debut shortly after the reintroduction of the serial's River Boys surf gang to the Bay. He notices two of the gang members Taz (Jerome Meyer) and Bluey (Alex Jewson) following Mason Morgan (Orpheus Pledger) from the surf club, with the intention of attacking him. As Taz and Bluey start to fight with Mason, Colby gets involved and warns them both to back off. Taz then punches him in the face just as the police arrive to break up the fight. Taz and Bluey are arrested, as Colby reveals to Sergeant Phillip McCarthy (Nicholas Cassim) that he is the Bay's new senior constable. It soon emerges that Colby is a former member of the River Boys when he reveals a \\"Blood and Sand\\" tattoo that is synonymous with the group. Franklin believed viewers would be divided over where Colby's loyalties lie. He liked that the conflict between Colby's \\"two worlds\\" gave his character more depth. Colby enjoys his career in the police force, but he feels that his time with the River Boys helped him become the man he is today. Colby was also given immediate links to the Bay through his friendships with River Boys member Dean Thompson (Patrick O'Connor) and Willow Harris (Sarah Roberts). Producers explored their dynamic early on as Colby shows guilt over something that happened in his past with Dean. He asks Dean to punch him in the hope that they can settle their grudge, but Dean refuses and tells Colby that he \\"lost everything\\" in a car crash they were both involved in. Dean then collapses and suffers convulsions due to a reaction to some home brewed beer. At the hospital, Willow questions Colby about the crash and Colby explains that he asked Dean to help him steal a car, but when it crashed, he left him to take the blame. Angered, Willow tells him that there is nothing he can say that will justify why he let Dean go to jail. As Dean recovers, he is \\"furious\\" that Willow knows the truth about the incident. =Relationship with Jasmine Delaney= Jasmine Delaney, played by Sam Frost (pictured), is Colby's first love interest. Tamara Cullen of TV Week speculated that Colby would become a love interest for nurse Jasmine Delaney (Sam Frost), and producers soon established a relationship between them. Colby and Jasmine meet when she reports her stalker to him. He assures her that he will help protect her. After she is stood up by Mason, Jasmine spends the afternoon getting to know Colby at local restaurant Salt. They bond over the fact they are both new to the Bay. At the end of their evening, they share \\"an unexpected kiss\\" while saying goodbye. Franklin and Frost later explained that they knew their characters would be involved in a romantic relationship from the moment they joined the cast. Franklin also said that the plot saw him perform his first ever on-screen kiss. Colby and Jasmine grow closer and they have sex, but Colby says that their relationship cannot go any further. Colby is shown to have feelings for Jasmine, but he is worried about getting romantically attached due to a secret he is hiding. Writers then had Colby reveal to Jasmine that he has been searching for his younger sister Bella Nixon (Courtney Miller) and his mother, who were kidnapped by his violent stepfather. He explains that he joined the police force to help with his search, and that he would have to \\"drop everything\\", including any romantic relationships, and leave town if he were to find a lead. As Jasmine supports Colby with his search, she develops feelings for him. Frost said that for her character, there was \\"always an attraction with Colby\\", while Franklin stated \\"Colby is more worried about entangling her in the dangers of what's happening in his life.\\" Franklin also stated that if finding Bella had not been Colby's priority, then he would have more time to commit to a relationship, which Jasmine seems to understand. Colby and Jasmine agree to have a casual relationship. Jasmine also listens as Colby admits that he feels like a failure due to his family issues and broken friendship with Dean. Colby ends the relationship when he learns that Jasmine told her friend about his past with the River Boys, shortly before the information is leaked to the press. =Shooting and revenge campaign= Colby's job and life come under threat after he shoots a kidnapper, which leads to a vendetta against him by the man's family. The arc began with the kidnapping of Justin Morgan's (James Stewart) daughter Ava Gilbert (Grace Thomas). Following a failed ransom exchange, Colby is determined to anything to get Ava back. Knowing that criminal Boyd Easton (Steve Le Marquand) and his mother Hazel Easton (Genevieve Lemon) have Ava, he realises that \\"there may have to be sacrifices\\" in order to keep her safe. Franklin said that Colby plans a trap for the kidnappers, involving a strike team who will move in and save Ava. Willow, who is dating Justin, gives the ransom money to Boyd and he lets Ava go. But when Boyd becomes spooked, he grabs Willow and Dean suddenly appears out of the bushes to save her. Speaking with Sarah Ellis of Inside Soap, Franklin explained, \\"Colby has to make a split-second decision ‚Äì kill for those you love, or watch them die.\\" Colby shoots Boyd, leaving him \\"deeply troubled\\" and feeling guilty and ashamed. But Franklin thought that if his character had the chance to do it again, he did not think Colby would change the outcome. Franklin admitted that he found the heightened emotion of the scene challenging, and he accidentally made shooting noises with his mouth when he fired the gun. Dean later confronts Colby about saving his life, which worries Colby as he think Dean might tell the police about his connection to the River Boys. Ebony Harding, played by Cariba Heine (pictured), comes to the Bay to get revenge on Colby for shooting her brother. Producers soon introduced Boyd's sister Ebony Harding, played by Cariba Heine, to the storyline. Ebony comes to Summer Bay with the intention of getting revenge on Colby and those involved in her brother's death. Ebony watches Colby's movements around the Bay, before conferring with her mother about their plan. Ebony later slashes her car tyre and asks for Colby's help in changing it, however, he is called into work allowing Mason and Hunter King (Scott Lee) to step in. Ebony later asks Colby out for a drink, but he turns her down due to his relationship with Jasmine. However, Ebony soon befriends Colby, who finds himself confiding in her about his personal life and his search for his sister. Franklin told John Burfitt of Soap World, Ebony is the one person who he feels he can really be himself with and relate to. He feels he can trust her and that they have a connection ‚Äì but she has set that up by lying to him in so many ways.\\" Ebony plots to ruin Colby and Jasmine's relationship by gatecrashing their date at Salt and openly flirting with Colby. A show spokesperson told Claire Crick of Soaplife, \\"Ebony's flirty ways leave Jasmine jealous, especially when Colby seems to be innocently ignorant to all the extra attention he's been receiving from his new friend.\\" Colby becomes fed up with Jasmine's jealously and they fight. He later learns that she has told her friend Leah Patterson about his River Boys past, and they fight again, which Ebony overhears. Having sabotaged Colby's relationship with Jasmine, Ebony goes after Colby's career next. After learning that he used to be a part of the River Boys, she leaks the information to the local newspaper, which publishes it on the front page. Colby confronts Jasmine, who denies leaking the story, so he turns to Willow and Dean, who are offended by the accusation. Colby is placed on leave from the police force, as his superiors work out what to do. Ebony photographs him shaking hands with Dean and sends it to the station, who then suspend him without pay for associating with a known criminal and gang member. When Colby realises that someone has a vendetta against him, Ebony hints that it is his flatmate Robbo (Jake Ryan). Ebony's plan comes to a climax when she poisons Colby and leaves him for dead. Ebony steals two vials of suxamethonium chloride (sux) from the hospital, before she goes to Colby's apartment and hits him with a frying pan. She injects him with a lethal dose of sux and leaves him to die. Colby is eventually found by Willow and Dean, and he is rushed to the hospital. Ebony also frames Robbo for murder, after she poisons her mother with the other vial of sux. Colby spends days in a coma after suffering an allergic reaction to the medication given to him at the hospital. When he wakes up, he learns that he suffers from malignant hyperthermia. He has a \\"shocking realisation\\" when he learns that the condition is genetic, meaning that his sister could have it. Colby discharges himself to continue his search with the new lead. Ebony later returns to continue her revenge campaign against Colby. She pretends to be Colby's sister Bella, and sends him messages through an online page he has set up to find her. Colby agrees to meet her and ignores the concerns of Jasmine and Robbo, who think it could be a trap. Robbo forces Colby to wear an earpiece and records an online call between himself and Ebony for evidence. Colby is directed to an empty house and Ebony locks him inside a bedroom. She then taunts him through a walkie talkie and tells him he will not get out, before attempting to light the house on fire, however, Robbo arrives in time to stop her. =Relationship with Chelsea Campbell= In September 2018, producers introduced a new love interest for Colby in the form of police officer Chelsea Campbell (Ashleigh Brewer). While discussing Brewer's appearance on the show, Jackie Brygel of New Idea hinted that Chelsea and Colby already shared a connection. Brewer also teased the storyline, saying: \\"Chelsea turns up in the Bay with Colby on the brain and pretty much him alone. She knows what she wants out of life and she's going to keep going until she gets it. Colby's definitely a big part of the plan. They have a lot of history together and you feel that straight away.\\" As Chelsea joins Colby at Yabbie Creek Station, it emerges that they were once engaged. Their boss Sergeant Phillip McCarthy (Nicholas Cassim) finds out about their previous relationship when he notices the tension between them. McCarthy is \\"furious\\" that they did not disclose their history and orders Colby to show Chelsea around, telling them that if they cannot work together, one of them will have to leave. Chelsea tries to reconcile with Colby, but he rejects her attempts. Chelsea tells him that she came to the Bay because Colby has been blanking her and she finds it hard to cope without him. They almost kiss, but Colby pulls away. Colby later admits that he was \\"devastated\\" when Chelsea ended their engagement, while Chelsea explains that she thought he had returned to the River Boys. Franklin stated, \\"She knows about his past and, at the time, he laid it all on the table about being a River Boy. But she didn't want to be part of it.\\" Colby also admits that he has missed Chelsea and they kiss. They then agree to give their relationship another go, with Franklin commenting \\"His resistance to her doesn't last long!\\" A wedding storyline was soon implemented for the couple. Colby gives Chelsea's engagement ring back to her, after telling her the truth about Dean and the car crash. She asks him to proposes to her properly, which he does. They decide to get married as soon as possible. Writers devised a break up for the couple following Colby's reunion with his sister, Bella. Chelsea ends their engagement upon learning that Colby has lied to her about going to find Bella. She also knows that he stole the address from her phone, and then kidnapped his sister. Dean attempts to intervene, but Chelsea feels that he is responsible for recent bad events in Colby's life. Colby later learns that Chelsea told their boss about Bella's presence in the Bay, leading to a confrontation in which Chelsea reveals that she is leaving town. Franklin commented, \\"Colby and Chelsea's relationship is just so dramatic! It can be a real challenge for them to find a balance.\\" Dean and Bella encourage Colby to fight for Chelsea, which is something Franklin thought his character needed to hear. He added, \\"It takes someone giving him that kick to fight for her. He needs that, and decides to put himself on the line and declare his love for her.\\" The characters marry in the 2018 season finale. In the lead up to the wedding, Chelsea, Colby and Bella make the decision to move to the city. When Chelsea is offered a job on a detective course, they move the wedding forward and are married in front of their friends. Brewer thought the \\"understated\\" ceremony was ideal for the couple, as they are not \\"showy\\" and just want to celebrate their love. Franklin thought that Colby had got the normal life and a family that he had wanted. Colby is unaware that his stepfather, Ross Nixon (Justin Rosniak) is watching and waiting to get revenge on him. Ross kidnaps Chelsea, Bella and Willow after posing as a limo driver. Franklin said the scenes were \\"intense\\" to film, and he added \\"everything from Colby's past comes crashing down, and he's chucked into a decision that changes everything for him.\\" Reception For his portrayal of Colby, Franklin was nominated for Best Soap Newcomer at the 2018 Digital Spy Reader Awards; he came in last place with 0.9% of the total votes. Ahead of his debut, a reporter for The Daily Telegraph branded Colby the show's \\"new heart-throb cop\\". A TVNZ writer praised the character's introduction and looks, saying: \\"We might still be mourning Kat, but the hunky new constable is a welcome distraction.\\" They also stated, \\"With handsome confidence and impeccable timing, Colby shows up just in time to save Mason from a brawl with the River Boys.\\" TV Week's Tamara Cullen had a similar reaction, writing, \\"tall, handsome and confident, the new cop in town is bound to attract attention. And after making his big debut on Home and Away last night, he's done just that!\\" Inside Soap columnist Sarah admitted to being \\"quite intrigued\\" by the character and how he fits in with the new River Boys. John Burfitt of Soap World included Colby in his feature on the six characters to watch closely in Australian soaps. Burfitt wrote, \\"Summer Bay's new cop Colby Thorne is a conflicted man, struggling to deal with the clash of his past and present lives.\\" Burfitt called him \\"an avid crime fighter\\" and said he would \\"have his work cut out for him, with Dean and a new breed of River Boys arriving in town, which only means one thing ‚Äì trouble!\\" Of the character's background, Claire Crick of Soaplife commented, \\"He arrived in Summer Bay to keep residents on the right side of the law... but it turns out that Senior Constable Colby Thorne isn't without his own murky past, because he used to be a River Boy!\\" Seth Adamson from TV Soap said that Colby and Dean were the \\"next generation of the River Boys\\" and \\"that clash is sure to make for some potent drama.\\" Of the character's romance with Jasmine, a TV Week columnist commented \\"Policeman Colby (Tim Franklin) has steamed up the screen with the local nurse in recent episodes of the show.\\" They branded Colby and Jasmine a \\"photogenic couple\\", who had \\"our full attention.\\" Following Chelsea's introduction, Radio Times critic Johnathon Hughes noted, \\"It's obvious there's still an attraction between the boy and girl in blue, but can they pick up where they left off with all that emotional baggage? And is it ever a good idea to mix business with pleasure...?\\" Tamara Cullen, writing for TV Week, said \\"Chelsea's decision to transfer to Summer Bay's police force in a bid to win Colby back initially caused him headaches both personally and professionally.\\" ReferencesExternal links *Colby Thorne at 7plus *Colby Thorne at TVNZ Home and Away characters Television characters introduced in 2018 Fictional police constables Fictional Australian police officers Fictional gang members Fictional murderers Fictional criminals on soap operas Male characters in television ","title":"Colby Thorne"},{"id":"59134857","text":"Arms of Roger Camoys, after succeeding his father: Or, on a chief gules, three plates.Catalogue of Seals in the Department of Manuscripts in the British Museum, Volume 2.

He composed the lyrics of \\"Arise Arise,\\" the party anthem of the centre-left Ghanaian political party, the National Democratic Congress (NDC), popularly sung to the tune of the Christian hymn, \\"Stand Up, Stand Up for Jesus.\\" He was dubbed by media pundits as the \\"Prince of Highlife\\".  Early life and education  Jewel Ackah was born in 1945 in Axim in the Western Region of Ghana to Emmanuel Ackah and Cecilia Dye. He was a member of the Nzema people. He had his early education at Axim Roman Catholic primary and completed his education in Takoradi in 1963. In his early career, he was a professional footballer and later worked for a shipping company called the Palm Line.

Life A native of Oddiyana, he was a Vajrayana monk at Oddiyana's Vaijayanta Sa·πÅghƒÅrama before arriving with his brother Deva≈õƒÅntika in the Song dynasty capital Bianjing (now called Kaifeng) in 980 CE.Sen 2016 Lu 2010, p.69 Emperor Song Taizong wanted the translation of more Indian Buddhist sutras. However, he was unsure about DƒÅnapƒÅla, Deva≈õƒÅntika, and Dharmadeva's translation abilities. He then invited them to the Imperial Palace and tested their translation abilities with Sanskrit sutras kept at his palace. As they were all bilingual in Chinese and Sanskrit, the three satisfied Emperor Song Taizong's translation expectations. He then built a new translation bureau in 982 CE, called the \\"Institute for the Translation of Sutras\\" on the western side of the Taiping Xingguo Monastery. The emperor also bestowed honorary purple robes to DƒÅnapƒÅla and cohorts. The emperor bestowed the honorary title 'Great Master of the Manifested Teaching' on DƒÅnapƒÅla. DƒÅnapƒÅla was assigned as one of the key translators of the newly founded Institute. Along with his cohorts, he thus restarted translation of Sanskrit Buddhist texts in China after a 170-year hiatus. Deva≈õƒÅntika and Dharmadeva, the two other chief translators at the Institute, passed away in 1000 CE and 1001 CE respectively. He became the only the chief Indian translator left at the Institute with only the assistance of Wei Jing (ÊÉüÊ∑®), a Chinese monk trained in Sanskrit at the Institute. It was not until 1006 with the arrival of DharmapƒÅla that he had another Indian translator to assist him in his work. Altogether he translated over 100 sutras, sastras and stotras, greatly contributing to the Chinese understanding of Vajrayana Buddhism and its popularization. Legacy The important Vajrayana root text SarvatathƒÅgata Tattvasa·πÉgraha Tantra was originally translated by Amoghavajra into Chinese during the 8th century CE, but it was an incomplete translation. DƒÅnapƒÅla was part of the team of translators who re-translated the entire SarvatathƒÅgata Tattvasa·πÉgraha Tantra. DƒÅnapƒÅla's contribution included the 1st and 14th-16th out of 18 sections. He also translated other Vajrayana sutras such as MƒÅyopamasamƒÅdhi Sutra among others. DƒÅnapƒÅla also translated many non-Vajrayana texts such as the NƒÅgƒÅrjuna's Yukti·π£a·π£·π≠ikƒÅ, MahƒÅyƒÅnavi·πÉsaka, DignƒÅga's Praj√±ƒÅpƒÅramitƒÅpi·πá·∏çƒÅrtha·∏• as well as a version of the A·π£·π≠asƒÅhasrikƒÅ Praj√±ƒÅpƒÅramitƒÅ S≈´tra, the Heart Sutra entitled 'The Holy Mother of [All] Buddhas Praj√±ƒÅpƒÅramitƒÅ S≈´tra' and the Candropama S≈´tra the Sanskrit version of Sa·πÉyutta NikƒÅya 16.3.

The movement was monarchist, and had the specific aim of replacing British parliamentary democracy with a restored monarch from the deposed House of Stuart.  The reign of the House of Stuart  The House of Stuart was a European royal house that originated in Scotland. Nine Stuart monarchs ruled Scotland alone from 1371 until 1603. The last of these, King James VI of Scotland became King James I of England and Ireland after the death of Elizabeth I in the Union of the Crowns. The Stuarts ruled the United Kingdom until 1714, when Queen Anne died. Parliament had passed the Act of Settlement in 1701 and the Act of Security in 1704, which transferred The Crown to the House of Hanover, ending the line of Stuart monarchs. James claimed the Divine right of kings ‚Äì meaning that he believed his authority to rule was divinely inspired. He considered his decisions were not subject to 'interference' by either Parliament or the Church, a political view that would remain remarkably consistent among his Stuart successors. When Parliament passed the acts that ended the rule of the House of Stuart, they effectively claimed that the monarch's power was derived from Parliament, not God.  Jacobitism  The core Jacobite belief was in the divine right of kings, and the restoration of the House of Stuart to the throne. However, Jacobitism was a complex mix of ideas; in Ireland, it was associated with tolerance for Catholicism and the reversal of the land settlements of the 17th century. After 1707, many Scottish Jacobites wanted to undo the Acts of Union that created Great Britain but opposed the idea of Divine right. = Ideology = Although Jacobite ideology was varied, it broadly held to four main tenets: * The divine right of kings and the \\"accountability of Kings to God alone\\", * The inalienable hereditary right of succession. * The \\"unequivocal scriptural injunction of non-resistance and passive obedience\\", * That James II had been illegally deprived of his throne, therefore the House of Stuart should be restored to the throne. The majority of Irish people supported James II due to his 1687 Declaration for the Liberty of Conscience, which granted religious freedom to all denominations in England and Scotland, and also due to James II's promise to the Irish Parliament of an eventual right to self-determination. = Religion = Jacobitism was closely linked with Catholicism, particularly in Ireland where Catholics formed about 75% of the population. In Britain, Catholics were a small minority by 1689 and the bulk of Jacobite support came from other groups, namely High Church Anglicans. In Scotland (excluding the Highlands and the Isles), it is estimated that about 2% of the population were Catholic, in addition to an Episcopalian minority. = Jacobite rebellions: 1680 to 1750 = Various groups of Jacobites attempted to overthrow Parliament during the 17th. and 18th. centuries. Significant uprisings included the 1689‚Äì1691 Williamite War in Ireland, a number of Jacobite revolts in Scotland and England between 1689 and 1746, and a number of unsuccessful minor plots. The collapse of the 1745 rising in Scotland ended Jacobitism as a serious political movement. However, the planned French invasion of Britain (1759) was to destroy British power overseas and to restore the Jacobite claimaints. It drew in a large part of French military resources, but was never launched because the Royal Navy kept control of the mouth of the Channel. As a result, French forces in Canada and India lacked resources and shipping, and were lost. Without the Jacobite need for support, arguably France could have expanded its empire in India and North America in the 1750s. Instead, the British had a \\"Year of Victories\\" in 1759. = Underground Jacobitism: 1750 to 1880 = In the years immediately after 1745, Jacobitism was rigorously suppressed. Jacobite sympathisers moved underground, forming secret clubs and societies to discus their ideas in private, especially in certain areas of the United Kingdom. John Shaw's Club, in Manchester was founded in 1735 and had several prominent members who had Jacobite sympathies, including its founder John Shaw, John Byrom (who may have been a \\"double agent\\" reporting on Jacobite activity) and Thomas Gaskell. North Wales was particularly known for its Jacobite sympathies. In the 18th. century a group called the Cycle Club met to discuss Jacobite ideas ‚Äì the full name of the Club, rarely used in public was the \\"Cycle of the White Rose\\". The club was founded in 1710, and was closely associated with the Williams-Wynn family, though a number of prominent families in the Wrexham area were members. Charlotte Williams-Wynn was a member of the club, and Lady Watkin Wynne (the wife of Robert Watkin Wynne) was their patron from 1780 onwards. The Cycle Club continued in various forms until around 1860.  The Neo- Jacobite Revival: 1886 to 1920 = The emergence of the Neo-Jacobites = In 1886, Bertram Ashburnham circulated a leaflet seeking Jacobite sympathisers, and amongst those who replied was Melville Henry Massue. Together they founded the Order of the White Rose, a Jacobite group that was the spiritual successor to the Cycle Club. The Order was officially founded on June 10, 1866. The Order attracted Irish and Scottish Nationalists to its ranks. While these various interests gathered under the banner of restoring the House of Stuart, they also had a common streak against the scientific and secular democratic norms of the time. Some even planned (but did not execute) a military overthrow of the Hanoverian monarchy, with the aim of putting Princess Maria Theresa on the British throne. See Jacobite succession. In parallel the Anglo-Catholic Oxford Movement had revived sympathy for Charles I and revered him as a martyr. This certainly played into the Jacobite narrative, and this thread of near-Jacobite thought was kept alive by men such as Hurrell Froude and James Yeowell who was known as 'the last Jacobite in England\\". = The Stuarts Exhibition = Catalogue for the 1899 Exhibition of the Royal House of Stuart In 1889, the New Gallery in London put on a major exhibition of works related to the House of Stuart. Queen Victoria lent a number of items to the exhibition, as did the wife of her son Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany; Jacobite families from England and Scotland donated items. The exhibition was hugely popular and provoked a widespread new interest in the Stuart monarchs. The exhibition itself showed some distinctive Jacobite tendencies, as Guthrie points out in his book: > It is clear that the point of the whole exhibition in the New Gallery ... > was a Stuart restoration and to bring the Jacobite fact and the modern > succession to the Stuart claim to the attention of the British public. = The Legitimist Jacobite League and other organizations = The new popularity sparked a renewed fervour for the Jacobite cause. In opposition to this, and coupled with the approaching tricentenary of Oliver Cromwell's birth in 1899, Cromwell also became a popular figure. Immediately following the exhibition, new Jacobite groups began to form. In 1890, Herbert Vivian and Ruaraidh Erskine co-founded a weekly newspaper, The Whirlwind, that espoused a Jacobite political view. The Order of the White Rose split in 1891, when Vivian, Erskine and Melville Henry Massue formed the Legitimist Jacobite League of Great Britain and Ireland. Vivian and Massue were leading members of the neo-Jacobite revival, while Erskine soon focused his political endeavours on the related cause of Scottish Nationalism. The League was a \\"publicist for Jacobitism on a scale unwitnessed since the eighteenth century\\". = The Neo- Jacobites in the political arena = The masthead of the first issue of The Whirlwind The continuing Order of the White Rose focused on a romantic ideal of a Jacobite past, expressed through the arts. Art dealer Charles Augustus Howell and journalist Sebastian Evans were members of the Order, while poets W. B. Yeats and Andrew Lang were drawn to the cause. The Legitimist Jacobite League was a decidedly more militant, political organisation. They organised a series of protests and events, often centred on statues of Jacobite heroes. In January 1893, the League attempted to lay a wreath at the statue of Charles I at Charing Cross, but were thwarted by a \\"considerable detachment of police\\" sent on the personal order of Gladstone. They also found supporters within Parliament. In 1891, Irish Nationalist Sir John Pope Hennessy, MP for North Kilkenny, attempted to extend Gladstone's Bill to remove limitations on Catholics to cover the Royal Family. This was an outcome devoutly wished for by the Neo-Jacobites as a step towards the restoration of the Stuarts. Jacobites started to stand as candidates for parliament. In 1891, artist Gilbert Baird Fraser stood, as did Vivian, as a candidate in East Bradford for the \\"Individualist Party\\" on a thoroughly Jacobite platform, and Walter Clifford Mellor (the son of John James Mellor MP), as a Jacobite in the North Huntingdonshire constituency. All three candidates lost. In 1895, Vivian stood in North Huntingdonshire as a Jacobite and lost again. In 1906, he was the Liberal candidate for Deptford and lost badly despite the support of his friend Winston Churchill. Finally, in 1907 he explored a candidacy in Stirling Burghs as a Legitimist; this time he withdrew before the election. In Scotland, a number of Scottish Nationalists were drawn to the cause. Theodore Napier, the Scottish secretary of the Jacobite League, wrote a polemic titled \\"The Royal House of Stuart: A Plea for its Restoration. An Appeal to Loyal Scotsmen\\" in 1898, which was published by the Legitimist Jacobite League. It was one amongst a large number of publications put out by the League. = The end of the revival = The revival largely came to an end with the advent of the First World War. The various Neo-Jacobite societies are now represented by the Royal Stuart Society.

Cecil Marion Cowles (c. 1893 ‚Äì March 28, 1968) was an American pianist, composer, and actress. She was a child prodigy and played the piano as well as composed music. Cowles made her professional debut in a musical in 1911. Personal life Cowles was known as a child prodigy, making her pianist debut at a concert when she was 8 years old. Her mother was a well known musician and her father had the ability to play exactly what he heard, just like Cowles was able to do from a young age. She studied at the Von Einde School in New York and later at the Von Meyernick School in California. Her piano instructors were Hugo Mansfeldt and Sigismund Stojowski, with her composition being taught by Carl Deis. Career On February 8, 1907, Thomas Nunan of The San Francisco Examiner wrote that she is not a prodigy, but rather a genius. At the time of the article's publication, Cowles was 14 years old and had written 24 compositions, including one of an opera and a ragtime piece. The night before the San Francisco Examiner article was published, she played the piano at Lyric Hall to a full audience. There was a reception held for Cowles at the end of her recital which had most of the audience attend, an affair that lasted for over 30 minutes. On November 22, 1910, Cowles played her own compositions at a Century Club Music Hall concert and the event was called \\"one of the memorable music affairs of the season\\" by The San Francisco Call. At the concert, her songs were sung by \\"distinguished soprano soloist\\" Helen Colburn Heath. Cowles made her first professional appearance on August 20, 1911, at the Savoy Theatre as a duchess in the musical The Rich Mr. Guggenhelmer, in which she sang one of her own songs. Cowles has an entry in the book Fifty local prodigies, 1906‚Äì1940, a selection of prodigies from San Francisco. San Francisco Examiner reporter Thomas Nunan wrote, \\"Prodigies are numerous; they are found everywhere. But Cecil Cowles is a genius, and children of her class are few.\\" Nunan also wrote a November 23, 1910, article for the same newspaper, stating that Cowles is a genius at 17 years old. People, including Cowles, asked Nunan for his opinion on a comparison between her and Liza Lehmann which Nunan's opinion was that > Miss Cowles is a far better pianist than is the English composer. But the > latter knows thoroughly the grammar of music, and the rhetoric of it, too, > and she knows exactly what did Omar meant, and until our young composer is > schooled in these things she must not expect to outclass the greatest woman > of English song.

He was also briefly Count of P√©rigord following the death of his brother John II, Count of Penthi√®vre, in 1454.  Biography  William was the son of John I, Count of Penthi√®vre and Margaret de Clisson. As a younger son, William was intended to join the clergy. He attended the University of Angers and, while he was young, his family negotiated with the duke of Brittany to grant him the Bishopric of Vannes or Saint-Brieuc. After Margaret de Clisson and her sons failed in their plot to overthrow John V, Duke of Brittany and assert their claim to Brittany between 1420 and 1422, the Penthi√®vre family was forced to appear before both the French Parliament and the Breton Estates at Vannes. Two of William's brothers were found guilty of felonies and treachery on 16 February 1425 and their properties in Brittany were confiscated. William himself had already been given over to the duke of Brittany as a hostage on 29 July 1420. William remained a hostage at Auray for twenty-eight years, during which time he lost his sight. He was finally freed in 1448 after his family reconciled with Francis I, Duke of Brittany. In 1450, he married Isabelle de la Tour d'Auvergne, daughter of Bertrand V de La Tour d'Auvergne, with whom he had three daughters: Frances; Joan, who married John de Surgeres, seigneur de Balon; and Charlotte, who married Antoine de Villequier, seigneur de Montr√©sor.

Established in 2005, the WTCCC aims to conduct genome-wide association studies (GWASs) to shed light on the genetic architecture of common human diseases. The founding chairman of the consortium was University of Oxford statistician Peter Donnelly. The consortium was funded by ¬£9 million from the Wellcome Trust. According to the consortium's website, it has identified \\"approximately 90\\" new susceptibility loci for common human diseases. The consortium's initial goal was to conduct large GWASs for eight common human diseases: tuberculosis, coronary heart disease, type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, bipolar disorder and hypertension. These GWASs included a total of 19,000 subjects, of whom 2,000 had one of the eight diseases and an additional 3,000 served as controls. The study participants were genotyped using Affymetrix's GeneChip Human Mapping 500K Array Set, and genotype calling was conducted with the Chiamo algorithm. The results of the WTCCC's initial research were reported in Nature in 2007. The research identified 24 genetic association \\"signals\\" that were statistically significant at P < 5 √ó 10‚àí7. At the time, this was the largest study ever conducted of the genetics of human diseases. In announcing the study's findings at a London news conference, Donnelly said, \\"If you think of the genome as a very long road that you are trying to find your way along in the dark, previously we have only been able to turn lights on in a small number of places, but now we can turn on lights in a large number of places‚Äî in this case half a million lights\\". The 2007 Nature paper was later named \\"paper of the year\\" by the Lancet, and it led to the WTCCC being named \\"research leader of the year\\" by Scientific American.

The company has been awarded millions of dollars in contracts from the DC government since its inception in 1972, many set aside for small and minority owned businesses. It has received attention for its contracting practices, influence in DC politics, and safety practices. History Fort Myer Construction was incorporated in 1972 by Jose Rodriguez, a Portuguese emigrant. Rodriguez also owns District Paving, another contractor, and bought one of his major competitors, Roubin & Janeiro. Rodriguez's brother, Francisco Rodriguez-Neto, owns Capitol Paving, another contractor. Operations Fort Myer Construction is the largest asphalt supplier and road paving company in the DC area. In 2012, Fort Myer Construction was paid over $78 million by the district. DC government-financed projects account for 40 percent of Fort Myer Construction's income. The company is designated as a Certified Business Enterprise (CBE), allowing it to receive preference in procurement opportunities offered by the District of Columbia. The company has dominated the program for small business and minority set asides. Court filings contested the need for the benefit when Fort Myer Construction demonstrated an ability to freely compete for local contracts on the open market as part of a lawsuit that the program unfairly excluded white-owned businesses. Concerned that media coverage might negatively affect its business, Fort Myer Construction hired DP Strategies to help \\"tell its story\\" through a video . In 2019, the company successfully completed reconstruction of a popular road in one of DC's National Parks. = Quality = Fort Myer Construction‚Äôs quality control lab is working with on the science behind preventing potholes. The current process has become more sophisticated with updated mixes, quality control, application and assessment. The methods are constantly changing to ensure smooth sailing when the rubber hits the road. = Community = The company has supported the DC Students Construction Trades Foundation. Chris Kerns, general counsel of Ft. Myer, received an award. =Campaign contributions= Fort Myer Construction has made substantial contributions to DC politicians. Anita Bonds was a top Fort Myer Construction official while serving as chair of the DC Democratic State Committee and before her election to the Council of the District of Columbia. Between 2002 and 2014, the company and its relatives gave more than $118,000 to candidates in political contributions. Fort Myer Construction was one of the largest donors to Fresh PAC, a short-lived initiative by Mayor Muriel Bowser to circumvent campaign finance regulations. Contract controversies Fort Myer Construction overbilled the government by inflating the cost of asphalt for construction jobs between 1995 and 1998. To make sure they were paid, the company bribed nine D.C. Department of Public Works employees, for which it pleaded guilty in 2003 and paid $900,000 in fines. Once discovered, Fort Myer Construction was barred from federal contracts for 18 months and for DC contracts for three years. Through its lobbying efforts, the company changed DC's debarment process, lifting the restrictions and making it more difficult for the District to sanction contractors. In 2014, DC's Office of the Inspector General found that Fort Myer Construction received below market rates for leasing the D.C. government's equipment. The company was charged less than what another jurisdiction billed the company, and there was limited documentation of the arrangement. Fort Myer Construction then held the equipment for more than three years. =Recent investigations= In 2016, the head of D.C.'s Department of General Services resigned and contracting officials were fired following the award of two large construction projects, St. Elizabeths East Entertainment and Sports Arena and Audi Field, to firms other than Fort Myer Construction. One of the fired employees filed a whistleblower lawsuit alleging that he had been terminated for the failure to channel contracts to Fort Myer Construction; the other made similar allegations in an administrative proceeding. An DC government office director reported that a Fort Myer Construction lobbyist used the DGS firings to discourage other government decisions unfavorable to the company. The episode prompted an investigation by Councilmember Mary Cheh. In 2017, Cheh's report found that in addition to the questionable firings, a city employee had illegally shared confidential information with Fort Myer Construction about a competitor's bid on a separate project. The report found that the D.C. City Administrator had urged quick settlement of unresolved contract disputes with Fort Myer Construction in an attempt to appease it. These actions led to an additional $4 million payout to the company. Other incidents In 2015, the company was sued for $12.5 million after a senior citizen was run over and killed by a Fort Myer Construction street sweeper. The alert signal on the vehicle was working, but the camera was not. In 2014, the company settled with the US Department of Labor over its discrimination of women and minorities. According to the settlement, the company compensated Hispanics and African Americans at lower hourly rates for the same work. Supervisors sexually harassed females subordinates and used derogatory language to minority and veteran employees. Fort Myer Construction agreed to pay another $900,000 in back wages and interest to 371 minority workers. In 2012, an 81-year-old employee was delivering mail was killed by a Fort Myer Construction dump truck driver. After striking the man once, the operator realized he had hit something, moved the vehicle, and hit him again. The 2012 incident followed a similar death of a 60-year-old by a dump truck driver three years earlier. In 1996, staff working for a Fort Myer Construction subsidiary were arrested at the Anacostia Naval Base. The workers were immigrants from Mexico or Central America and were detained by Immigration and Naturalization Service after security officers became suspicious of their status.

He returned to Lund the following year and was able to sell some paintings to the local Art Society. In 1875, he left home for D√ºsseldorf, where he studied with Swedish-German genre painter Ferdinand Fagerlin. He introduced Kulle to the work of the D√ºsseldorf School. In 1877, Kulle sent home a painting, \\"The Church Council in Sk√•ne\\" that was bought by the Nationalmuseum.Malm√∂ museum In 1880, he received a scholarship from the Dahlgrenska Foundation (Stiftelsen Dahlgrenska fonden) in Str√∂mstad and moved to Paris.

It has narrow, cylindrical pseudobulbs, each with up to three thin, dark green leaves and usually only one or two white to cream-coloured flowers with yellow and purple markings near the centre. Description Dendrobium finniganense is a terrestrial or lithophytic herb that has narrow, cylindrical pseudobulbs long and wide. The pseudobulbs are pale green to yellowish and have up to three thin, elliptic to lance-shaped leaves long and wide. The flowering stem emerges from the end of the pseudobulb and is long with one or two resupinate white to cream-coloured flowers with yellow and purple markings near the centre. The flowers are long and wide. The dorsal sepal is long, wide and the lateral sepals are a similar length but about twice as wide. The petals are long and wide. The labellum is white with reddish purple markings, about long and wide with three lobes. The side lobes are upright and triangular and the middle lobe is rounded with a central ridge and tangled hairs along its edges. Flowering occurs between November and January. Taxonomy and naming Dendrobium finniganense was first formally described in 1992 by David Jones and the description was published in Phytologia. The specific epithet (finniganense) is a reference to the type locality, Mount Finnigan. Distribution and habitat The Mount Finnigan cane orchid grows in exposed places often between boulders or Lomandra tussocks near the summits of Mount Finnigan, Mount Pieter Botte and Thornton Peak.

It was constructed privately in 1841, using convict labour. Its purpose was to provide a shorter route to a seaport for wool grown at Braidwood and beyond. The historical significance of The Wool Road is that it was the first road, capable of being used by wheeled vehicles, linking the inland area around Braidwood to the South Coast. The road led to the foundation of the privately-owned port town of South Huskisson (called Vincentia since 1952) and the adjacent 'government townshIp' of Huskisson. The Wool Road's route made its use difficult and the port on Jervis Bay was not a success. In 1856, the original road was realigned and extended to Terara (near Nowra) instead of Jervis Bay, becoming the Braidwood Road. The old route through the coastal escarpment to Jervis Bay fell into disuse for many years. Much of the original route of The Wool Road remains in use today but some parts are accessible only to four-wheel drive traffic. Only a part of the original route that is currently in use is known as The Wool Road or The Old Wool Road today‚Äîthe section from the Princes Highway to Vincentia. The remainder of the original route still in use today is made up of a significant part of the Braidwood Road (MR92), Wandean Road, and a short section of the Princes Highway.Wandean Gap - The bottom of the first of three steep sidelings on Wandean Road (1841 Wool Road) that take it from the plateau of the Pigeon House Range to the ridgeline sloping toward the coast. (February 2019)  Historical context  Tool-sharpening groves made by Wandandian people, in sandstone rock nearby the route of The Wool Road, outside Vincentia, N.S.W. (April 2019) The land between Nerriga and Jervis Bay is part of the country of the Wandandian people, a group of the Yuin. The Wandandian people, spoke Dharamba, which was probably the northernmost dialect of the Dhurga language. Traditionally, the Wandandian people used paths, from the Pigeon House Range through the area now known as Wandandian, to reach the fishing grounds of St George's Basin and the inland hunting areas of the tablelands. In the 1830s and 1840s, the Wandandian people still lived on their traditional lands. The land also lay within the County of St. Vincent, one of the Nineteen Counties in which white settlement was permitted by the colonial government of New South Wales. In the late 1820s and 1830s colonial settlement had spread to the vicinity of Lake George, Braidwood, Yass, the Limestone Plains (now Canberra), and beyond to the Monaro district. The country settled was well-suited for the production of wool, for which there was a booming export market, but lay far from the existing port of Sydney. Transporting the wool bales using the cumbersome bullock drays of the time involved a long and arduous journey from Braidwood‚Äîtaking around three weeks at the bullock's slow pace and with their need to stop for rest, feeding and watering‚Äîvia Bungonia and Goulburn to Sydney. The owner of Yarralumla, Terence Murray, further away at the Limestone Plains, complained that, in wet weather, the drays could take as long as three months to reach Sydney. In the 1830s, a bridle-track known as the Corn Trail was made, from Clyde Mountain to the coastal Buckenbowra Valley, but it was steep and only usable by pack horses. Transport of wool in bales required a road that could be used by bullock drays. Jervis Bay, a large sheltered bay that was suitable as a deep water port lay far closer than Sydney but there was no road from Braidwood toward the coast beyond Nerriga. From 1831, there were sea-going auxiliary steamships‚Äîsuch as the Sophia Jane‚Äîoperating in New South Wales but steam powered railways were not in place before the mid-1850s. Although transportation of convicts to New South Wales had ceased in 1840, it was still a penal colony. Convicts were a workforce that could be put to work on road making.  Route  The valley of Tianjara Creek, looking north from Tianjara Falls. The Wool Road passed south of the top of the falls to avoid this valley and the nearby valley of the Clyde River. The endpoints of The Wool Road were the village of Nerriga‚Äîby 1841 already connected to Braidwood by a rudimentary road‚Äîand the newly created port of South Huskisson (later known as 'the old township' and today known as Vincentia) on Jervis Bay. The significant geographical obstacles to be overcome were crossing the Endrick River near Nerriga, climbing to a plateau in the northern part of the Pigeon House Range, then avoiding the steep valleys and gorges cut into that plateau by tributaries of the Shoalhaven and Clyde rivers, and subsequently descending from the plateau to the coastal plain to reach Jervis Bay. After fording the Endrick River, The Wool Road broadly followed the direction of the modern-day Braidwood Road (MR92), from Nerriga to near the Boolijah Peak, a point east of Sassafras. The current Braidwood Road alignment is the result of an upgrade in 1856. The original 1841 road's exact route was different in some places, most significantly where it climbs the Pigeon House Range at Bulee Mountain near Nerriga. The 1841 road traversed the ridge to the north of Bulee Mountain and went through the man-made Bulee Gap, whereas the 1856 alignment and the current road pass to the south of Bulee Mountain202x202pxFollowing the line of the modern Braidwood Road, the road crested the Pigeon House Range, at a location known as Billy's Hill. It then passed over the narrow part of the plateau not cut by the impassable gorges of Ettrema Creek and Bainbrig Creek. It continued past Sassafras and the Tianjara Falls, through another narrow part of the plateau, between the impassable valleys of Tianjara Creek and the most upstream parts of the Clyde River. From near the Boolijah Peak, The Wool Road diverged from the current route of the Braidwood Road and followed the route of modern-day Wandean Road, through the steep Wandean Gap. (historically also known as the Jerrawangala Gap), then following ridgelines of tributaries of Wandandian Creek, to Wandandian. In this section, the road's elevation dropped by approximately 2,500 feet in 10 miles (760m in 16 km), as it descended the coastal escarpment, via the locality of Jerrawangala and Wandandian. Most of this part of the route is now only accessible to four- wheel drive traffic. A video showing travel from Braidwood Road to Wandandian. The Wandean Gap section of the road is shown between 3:50 and 4:40. From Wandandian, The Wool Road followed the route of a previous foot track‚Äîalready in existence by 1841 and probably of Aboriginal origin‚Äîto Jervis Bay. Its route followed the approximate line of the existing Princes Highway for a short distance (skirting north of Wandandian Creek)., then broadly followed the direction of the modern road still known as 'The Wool Road', from the modern-day Princes Highway near Basin View, via St George's Basin to Vincentia. At St. George's Basin, the 1841 route followed the road now known as 'The Old Wool Road' where it deviates from a section of the modern-day The Wool Road that was constructed around 1929. The Wool Road ended at a port on Jervis Bay that is now Vincentia.  History = Finding the route = In 1831, Robert Futter of Bungonia and George Galbraith of Nerriga formed an expedition to find a path from Nerriga to Jervis Bay. The others making up the expedition were William Ryrie, James Holman‚Äîwho was known as the 'Blind Traveller'‚Äîand two Aboriginal guides whose names are not known. Holman later recounted‚Äîin his book ‚ÄòA Voyage Round The World: Including Travels In Africa, Asia, Australia, America Etc. From 1827 - 1832' , published in 1834-1835 ‚Äîthat the route they had taken from Yerock Flat (west of Sassafras Mountain) to the coast was taken against the advice of the Aboriginal guides, who had strongly suggested following the range further to the north. Holman later recognised that had they done so they could have found a far easier route for a road to Jervis Bay (such as that of the longer but less steep Turpentine Road). However, the explorers had passed through rugged and difficult country and, having reached Jervis Bay via what was apparently the shortest route, did not search for any longer but easier route. In 1839, the owner of Yarralumla, Terence Aubrey Murray, also explored a route between Nerriga and Jervis Bay, which may have been similar to that followed by the Futter expedition. = Proponents = After at first failing to obtain government funding for such a road in 1839, landholders from around Braidwood and Nerriga decided to fund and build their own road from Nerriga to Jervis Bay. The principal advocates and financial backers for the new road were Colonel John McKenzie of Nerriga and Dr. Thomas Braidwood Wilson of Braidwood. Wealthy and influential colonists Terence Aubrey Murray, Alexander Berry, Robert Campbell, Thomas Walker and James Macarthur were also supporters of the new road. Edward Deas Thompson‚Äîat the time the Colonial Secretary of New South Wales‚Äîstood to benefit from the construction of the road. He owned 2,560 acres of otherwise useless land on the western shore of Jervis Bay south of Moona Moona Creek, where an east-facing point‚Äînow known as Plantation Point‚Äîprovided shelter from the south and a safe port‚Äîthe 'Inner Harbour'‚Äîand a port township could be situated. = Survey = The route of the new road was surveyed by a government surveyor, James Larmer, who delivered his final report on the route in August 1840. Larmer advocated the same basic route followed by the Futter and Murray expeditions and‚Äîapparently in ignorance‚Äîdismissed any route descending to the coast further north than his surveyed line. His report reads, \\"In conclusion I beg to add that on so great an extent of Road less obstructions and difficulties in the formation could not be met on any other line of Road of the same extent in the Colony‚Äîand from enquiries I have made both from whites and Aboriginals and from my own observations I am fully convinced that it would be impossible to discover a more practicable line than the one now Surveyed. On the North it is a bold and continuous range but totally unfit for Drays to pass down to the Coast‚Äîand on the South numerous deep rocky gullies that are impassable.\\" = Construction = Seventy convicts were assigned to Nerriga landowner Colonel John McKenzie, under the command of Captain John Coghill, in February 1841, and work commenced. In June 1841, another fourteen men, to work on the road, arrived at the new port of South Huskisson aboard the steamer Tamar. The Bulee Gap was created by blasting away a narrow neck of sandstone rock to bring the road onto the plateau of the Pigeon House Range. Blasting was also needed to create a pass for the descent through the Wandean Gap. The Wool Road covered a distance of approximately 37 miles (60 km) and it was built at an estimated cost of ¬£997. As the road neared completion, the road gang became a nuisance at the Jervis Bay end of the road; a report stated that, \\"Scenes of debauchery and violence are of daily occurrence, there being no magistrate or constable to control them.\\" The road from Nerriga to the coast was completed in October 1841. In 1842, the existing road linking Nerriga to Braidwood was substantially upgraded, also using convict labour assigned to Colonel John Mackenzie. By late 1842 there was a road capable of taking wheeled traffic from Braidwood and beyond to Jervis Bay. = Heyday = The first cargo of wool from Nerriga was carried over The Wool Road and loaded at South Huskisson in late 1841. At first, the drays were taken to the beach and the wool bales were carried out on small boats to a waiting ship but, after a company was formed to do so‚Äîin March 1842 ‚Äîa wharf was built during late 1842. The auxiliary steamship Sophia Jane made her first trip to the port of South Huskisson in June 1841 and provided a monthly and at times twice monthly service between the port and Sydney. The barque Cygnet visited the port in December 1842 to load a cargo of wool for London. The town of South Huskisson grew around the port, located on land granted in 1830 to Edward Deas Thompson. A wool store capable of storing 2,000 bales of wool and an inn were built. At least 200 building allotments in the private township were sold during 1841, at high prices on an assumption of the success of the road and port, and in anticipation of large future capital gains. The total of the prices of the 100 allotments sold in June 1841 was ¬£3,519. A 'government township' was also surveyed to the north of Moona Moona Creek, which became Huskisson. Allotments were sold in Huskisson in February 1843. Five villages were planned, as stops for bullock teams along The Wool Road, with another village planned near the Tianjara Falls. The settlement to be known as 'Narriga' was to be located at the road's crossing point on the Endrick River, some distance further east and at a lower elevation than the modern-day village of Nerriga. = Difficulties and decline = Sydney wool merchants and shipping interests, and businesses along the road to Sydney, were opposed to the road and the new port. Soon after the road opened, in January 1842, an anonymous report of difficulties using it appeared, which included a prediction that, \\"it is doubtful if ever it will be completed and when finished, a constant thoroughfare to the sea coast; inasmuch as the route is chiefly barren scrub, and badly watered.\\" A year later, in January 1843, an article in the Sydney Morning Herald stated that, \\"The township, the wharf, and the road, have all still to contend against the evil reports which have been so industriously circulated respecting them by interested parties\\". There was some factual basis for such negative views. Geographic and economic difficulties affected The Wool Road and these, rather than the 'evil reports', caused it to fall into disuse after a relatively short time. The steep descent proved a problem for the cumbersome bullock drays of the day. Although the distance was short, the slowness of the fully laden bullock drays descending the steep route led to ships being delayed at Jervis Bay and on at least one occasion leaving without taking on a cargo there. With hindsight, the route of The Wool Road via the Wandean Gap had been a poor choice; far better routes for roads over the coastal escarpment would be found later. The truth about the road‚Äîand the country through which it ran‚Äîwas very much contrary to the apparently exaggerated claims that had been made, when town allotments in South Huskisson had been sold for high prices in 1841. The country atop the Pidgeon House Range was infertile land that was unsuitable to provide grazing for the bullock teams, with the exception of the natural clearing at Yerock (or Yarrock) Flat‚Äîknown as McKenzie's Paddock‚Äîand the nearby area of volcanic soil around Sassafras. Fodder had to be carried. Water was also limited. The planned villages along the route did not eventuate. The wharf at South Huskisson, although viable, was small when compared to the numerous wharves of Sydney Harbour. The Wool Road was used for wool grown around Nerriga and Braidwood but it proved to be impractical for those places further away, like Yarralumla and the Monaro beyond. As a result, some of those who had supported the building of the road, such as Terence Aubrey Murray, did not use it once it was completed. In late 1843, it was advertised that wool could be shipped to Sydney from the new port of Boydtown on Twofold Bay. Although in time the port of Boydtown too would be a failure, it was in competition for wool cargoes with the port of South Huskisson, and it lay much closer by land to the Monaro. The absence of wool cargoes from the outer areas meant that the volume of wool shipped via The Wool Road and its port was much less than had been expected. The road needed regular maintenance work and repair, especially after wet weather, to keep it open. Money became short when New South Wales entered an economic depression in the 1840s. The causes of the depression were complex; it was probably triggered by a lengthy drought in the period 1839-1841.‚Äîwhich reduced wool production‚Äîfollowed by falls in the prices of wool and sheep, and was exacerbated by the cessation of convict transportation in 1840‚Äîthe assignment of new convicts to private service ended on 21 July 1841‚Äîwhich created a shortage of low-cost labour, at a time when landholders and business people had significant debts. In 1842, there were numerous insolvencies and in 1843 some bank failures. Being privately owned, the port and The Wool Road received no assistance from the government. By June 1842, some of the people who had subscribed to fund the building of the road could not meet their commitments to pay costs already incurred in its construction. A petition was made in October 1843 to recoup from the government a quarter of the ¬£2400 in debts that had been incurred to build the road and quay to that date. This may indicate that the backers of the road and port were already in financial difficulty. Two main backers of the road and port, John McKenzie of Nerriga and Dr. Thomas Wilson of Braidwood, were ruined financially during the 1840s depression, Wilson died in November 1843‚Äîprobably by his own hand‚Äîleaving debts of ¬£15,264 with a deficiency of ¬£14,439, colossal sums at that time. McKenzie lost all his land and, in 1853, was reduced to asking permission to live in a house in South Huskisson belonging to Edward Deas Thompson. It had been envisaged that wool would be exported direct to England from the port at South Huskisson but the port more typically was serviced by coastal steamers. Any wool carried by these steamers needed to be transshipped for export at Sydney. Shipping operators were only interested in servicing Jervis Bay, if the trade was profitable. By late 1843, some woolgrowers had found that the coastal sea freight costs were too high to justify using Jervis Bay, and were again taking their wool by bullock dray over the land route to Sydney, The first wool auction in Sydney was held by T.S. Mort in 1843Interpretive signage in the small museum display about the wool industry at the 'Big Merino', Goulburn, N.S.W. (accessed November 2018) Soon afterwards, Samuel Lyons and other Sydney auctioneers also entered the wool auction business, and the practice rapidly became widespread. The introduction of the wool auction system‚Äîand the better prices that could be obtained‚Äîhad the result of increasing the dominance of Sydney as the export port for wool, because the wool had to be sent first to Sydney to be auctioned. The Sophia Jane was still calling at Jervis Bay in early June 1844 but in mid-June it went only as far as Wollongong, and after that seems to have been on the run to Morpeth. Although small coastal ships still visited the port, the days of South Huskisson as a major port had ended and no more wool was loaded there after December 1843. The steep part of The Wool Road, passing through the Wandean Gap and on to Wandandian, fell into disuse and became overgrown in parts, as early as 1848. In 1854, the road to Jervis Bay‚ÄîThe Wool Road‚Äîwas described as being in a state of \\"total abandonment\\". The last portion of the road from Wandandian to South Huskisson (now Vincentia) seemed to remain in local use but only in parts, as private roads and tracks across private land. The decline of the port town was rapid. South Huskisson was described by a visitor in 1851 as a \\"village on a small scale\\". and of its buildings it was said that \\"some of them still stand\\". The town allotments in the private township of South Huskisson‚Äîand the nearby 'government town' of Huskisson‚Äîessentially had become worthless, by the mid-1850s. By 1867, South Huskisson was deserted‚Äîany buildings were just ruins by 1885‚Äîand, by the early 1930s, all that remained of 'the old township' was a solitary Norfolk Island Pine.  Realignment and alternative routes  Braidwood Road (1856 route) ascending the escarpment east of Nerriga, in 2006, prior to its upgrading to modern highway standard. The cliff face shown survives, alongside the upgraded road. This location is just a little west of where the 1856 and 1841 routes merged at Bulee Gap. The discovery of gold in the Braidwood (Major's Creek), Araluen and Nerriga areas in the early 1850s provided an impetus for better roads to the coast. Bulee Gap‚ÄîMan-made cutting viewed from where the 1841 route merged with the 1856 road. (February 2019). In 1856, The Wool Road was realigned‚Äîbased on a new survey by George Legge‚Äîto bypass the steep Bulee Gap section and continued, as a new branch off the original 1841 route, via Nowra Hill to a wharf at Terara‚Äîjust east of modern-day Nowra‚Äîon the tidal part of the Shoalhaven River. The new road included a bridge across the Endrick River and its elevation decreased gradually from Sassafrass to Nowra. This 1856 government road became the modern day Braidwood Road (MR92). It was capable of being used by bullock drays and wool, in loads of between 24 and 50 bales, was transported over it to Nowra until the early years of the 20th century. From the line of the new Braidwood Road, another new road‚Äîbuilt in the late 1860s and known as 'the Turpentine Road'‚Äîbranched eastward to Tomerong. It still provides a much gentler gradient to Jervis Bay, on a route to the north of the older and steeper 1841 Wool Road that passed through the Wandean Gap. The Clyde Road‚Äîfirst used in early 1858 and later a part of the King's Highway‚Äîwas built from Braidwood, via Clyde Mountain and following a line surveyed by Sir Thomas Mitchell in 1855, to the Clyde River at Nelligen, which became a port. Another road to the coast‚Äîthe Araluen Road‚Äîwas built from Araluen to Moruya, in 1867-1868. The Main Southern railway line and other rail lines were constructed in the second half of the 19th century, confining bullock drays to transporting wool from outlying areas to the new railheads, particularly Goulburn (after 1869) from where the wool could be carried quickly to Sydney. Before the railway was extended beyond Goulburn, the town had sixty carriers delivering to the railhead.Interpretive signage at Goulburn Railway Station (accessed Nov. 2018). In 1893, the South Coast railway line reached Bomaderry, just north of Nowra, providing a second railhead. A section of the original The Wool Road from Nerriga that passed through the Bulee Gap cutting was bypassed by the 1856 route but it remained in use as an alternative stock route to the corresponding part to the newer Braidwood Road. During the Second World War, a part of this section of the original road was deliberately destroyed using explosives, to limit access by an enemy to the inland area and the national capital, Canberra.  Legacy and remnants  One surviving section of the original 1841 Wool Road is located just north of the existing Braidwood Road (MR92), near to the Bulee Gap, east of Nerriga. The man-made Bulee Gap cutting‚Äîbypassed by the 1856 route‚Äîand the surviving sections of original road passing through it, are remnants of the 1841 convict-built road. (A part of the original road immediately north of the Bulee Gap cutting was deliberately and thoroughly destroyed during WWII.) The existing Braidwood Road (MR92), east of Bulee Gap, largely follows the original 1841 route of The Wool Road but the section of the current road west of the Bullee Gap largely follows the 1856 realignment. Braidwood Road (1856 route). Preserved section of 1856 road near where it merged with the older (1841) Wool Road that emerged from the Bulee Gap cutting (shown in the centre background). (February 2019) When assessed in 2002, the Braidwood Road west of the Bulee Gap showed some remnants of the 1856 roadworks and was an example of road making from the immediate post-convict period, before the formation of the Department of Public Works in 1859. Drill marks were visible in the sandstone outcrops where they have been cut by the road makers. Dry stone retaining walls were evident, some of which had been compromised by modern road grading. Between 2007 and 2010, the Braidwood Road was sealed and upgraded to modern highway standard at a cost of $99-million, including major work where the road climbs from the Endrick River and passes the Bulee Gap The work in that area included removing bends, cutting back the cliff faces, installing high retaining walls and building a four-span concrete bridge structure. The route of the modern road over the bridge structure preserved sandstone landforms and a part of the 1856 road's formation, including a dry stone walled embankment and the junction with the older 1841 route at the south end of the Bulee Gap cutting.Wandean Gap‚ÄîWandean Road (1841 Wool Road) at the start of the steep descent.(February 2019)The last portion of the road to South Huskisson (now Vincentia) was reopened as a public road around 1911-12 and that involved the resumption of some private land‚Äîland being used at the time as 'private road' or 'private track'‚Äîto do so (South Huskisson‚Äînow Vincentia‚Äîwas, at that time, still a 'private town'). The modern road is known as The Wool Road and is a largely straight road. To the south of the modern Wool Road‚Äîstarting at Island Point Road and following a more circuitous route south of Cockrow Creek‚Äîis 'The Old Wool Road' and connecting it to the modern day The Wool Road is 'Wool Lane' . Where it exists, this 'Old Wool Road' is closer to the route of the original road than the corresponding section of the modern straighter road. Historically, the end of The Wool Road was where it entered the town of South Huskisson, from where the streets of the town led to a wharf on Jervis Bay; the modern day road known as The Wool Road now ends at a roundabout intersecting Elizabeth Drive and Burton Street, Vincentia, near the shore of Jervis Bay. Some hewn sandstone blocks from the 1842 wharf are visible at low tide near the Holden Street boat ramp Many street names from \\"The Old Township\\" are still in use in Vincentia today and much of the original street plan remains. The 'government town' north of Moona Moona Creek, which was surveyed at the same time as \\"the Old Township\\", grew from the early 1860s onwards to become modern-day Huskisson. There is a lookout known as the Jerrawangala Lookout and to reach it visitors turn off Braidwood Road and pass over part of the 1841 route, along the first part of modern-day Wandean Road. The 1841 route of The Wool Road passes through the Wandean Gap approximately 500m to the north from the location of the modern day lookout. The elevation of the lookout demonstrates the folly of building a road through the escarpment at this location. Drill marks in the rocks at Wandean Gap are remnants of the construction of The Wool Road in 1841. The little used road through the Wandean Gap to Wandandian (Wandean Road) still exists; most of it is single-lane and unsealed and much of it is unsuitable for general traffic.

The main branch of the clan ruled as daimy≈ç of Yamato- K≈çriyama Domain in Yamato Province (150,120 koku) until the Meiji restoration, and was subsequently unbowed with the kazoku peerage title of hakushaku (count). Origins and Edo period history The Yanagisawa were originally from Kai Province and descend from Ichijo Tokinobu, grandson of Takeda Nobunaga, a grandson of Takeda Nobuyoshi (1128-1186). Yanagisawa Nobutoshi (1548-1614) was the son of Aoki Nobutaka, and member of the Mukawashu, a cadet branch of the Takeda clan descending from Ichijo Tokinobu, and a group of warriors who defended the border. At that time, the Aoki clan was in the position of the head of the Mukawashu. After the fall of the Takeda clan, the Yanagisawa together with other Mukawashu were recruited by Tokugawa Ieyasu, who protected several surviving retainers of the Takeda clan, such as the Yonekura clan and the Tsuchiya clan. On August 16, 1582, Ieyasu granted him 72 kan 800 mon of land in Kai province. In 1590, when Ieyasu was transferred to Kanto, Nobutoshi received 230 koku in the Hachigata territory of Musashi Province. Yanagisawa Yasuyoshi (1595-1686), his son, was a Hatamoto, a direct retainer of Tokugawa Hidetada and later Tokugawa Ietsuna, increasing his income to 430 koku, whereas his younger brother Yanagisawa Yasutada (1602-1687) went into the service of Tokugawa Tsunayoshi of Tatebayashi Domain. Yanagisawa Yoshiyasu (1659-1714), son of Yasutada inherited the family stipend of 530 koku in 1675 when his father retired. In 1680, when Tokugawa Tsunayoshi, became the 5th Shogun, Yoshiyasu, became also the direct retainer of the Shogun. In 1688 he was appointed Sobayonin (Lord Chamberlain) and was promoted to Daimyo of Sanuki Domain (12,000 koku) in Kazusa province. In 1690, he was given an additional 20,000 koku. In 1694 he was appointed as R≈çj≈´, and transferred to Kawagoe Domain (82,000 koku). In 1704, when Tokugawa Tsunatoyo from K≈çfu Domain was chosen as Tsunayoshi's heir, Yoshiyasu was transferred to K≈çfu Domain (150,000 koku). From April 10 to April 12 of the same year, at the memorial service for the 133rd anniversary of the death of Takeda Shingen at Kai Erin-ji Temple, Yoshiyasu emphasized that he was a member of the Takeda family. In 1706, he was promoted to the rank of Tair≈ç. His son, Yanagisawa Yoshisato was transferred in 1724 to Yamato-K≈çriyama Domain in 1724, where his descendants resided to the abolition of the han system in 1871. The final daimy≈ç of Yamato-K≈çriyama Yanagisawa Yasunobu received the kazoku peerage title of hakushaku (Count). Cadet branches * A branch of the clan descended from Yanagisawa Tsunetaka, the 4th son of Yanagisawa Yoshiyasu was granted the 10,000 koku holding of Kurokawa Domain (today part of Tainai, Niigata), from 1723 to 1868, and subsequently received the title of viscount. * A branch of the clan descended from Yanagisawa Tokichika, the 5th son of Yanagisawa Yoshiyasu was granted the 10,000 koku holding of Mikkaichi Domain (today part of Shibata, Niigata), from 1723 to 1868, and subsequently received the title of viscount.

He later contributed to Bara, a private circulation gay magazine, and Barazoku, the first commercially published gay magazine in Japan. From the 1970s until the late 1990s, Funayama disappeared from public life, and did not publish or circulate art for over three decades. In 1999, he resurfaced to submit two illustrations to the magazine G-men, with a promise to submit additional works. No further works were submitted by Funayama which, combined with his presumed advanced age, led his contemporaries to assume he had died. Little is known about Funayama's private life. Married with a daughter, Funayama worked as a police officer; he drew while on night shift, and kept his illustrations in his work locker. He was an acquaintance of the writer Yukio Mishima, who would visit Funayama while in Kansai.

From 1906 to 1912, he lived alternately in Sweden, Norway and France. From 1909 to 1910, he took lessons from Matisse but, despite his admiration for Matisse's work, preferred Van Gogh and remained an impressionist. In Sweden, De Unga had some successes at staging exhibitions, but essentially ceased to exist in 1911, as Simonsson's interest waned and he spent much of his time out painting with S√∏rensen. They also took a study trip to Italy, but Simonsson was unimpressed. The Lesson In 1912, he decided to settle in G√∂teborg, where he was able to find a patron, , who supported young artists and helped them make contacts with potential buyers. In 1915, he married Ingrid Gustafsson and spent the next two years living in Kung√§lv, where he painted en plein aire. He then returned to Goteborg and taught painting in nearby Valand. He spent the summers in Bohusl√§n, painting portraits of women and children. In 1919, after the war, he returned with his family to Paris, where they lived for seven years, although he continued to exhibit in Sweden and Norway. After returning there, he continued to exhibit prolifically and enjoyed great success but, apparently, was beginning to become depressed by the northern climate. In 1930, he became a member of the Konsth√∂gskolan Valand and, the following year, became Chair of the landscape painting department; a position he held until his death. His works may be seen at the Moderna Museet and the G√∂teborgs konstmuseum as well as at smaller museums in G√§vle, √ñrebro, Sandviken and Ystad.

Kumar's diverse professional life has spanned across industries and shaped her perspective ‚Äì‚Äì one that is driven by both the empowerment and protection of ordinary Fijians. Starting her career as a biology and chemistry teacher, she quickly rose through the ranks of the education sector before transitioning to policy, serving as a Government environmental advocate, and later, an investment manager at Fiji Islands Trade & Investment Bureau (now Investment Fiji). She then moved on to become the Chief Executive Officer of the Consumer Council of Fiji, a leadership role that she held for over 12 years ‚Äì‚Äì rightfully earning her the reputation of a staunch consumer advocate throughout Fiji and the Pacific. As its longstanding CEO, Kumar transformed the Council into a high-profile powerhouse for consumer rights. She quickly became known for boldly and directly taking on challenges on behalf of Fijian families, and effectively fighting for meaningful change by lobbying Government to break up business practices that she uncovered to be unethical and lacking transparency. Notably, she led recent groundbreaking campaigns on accident compensation, restaurant grading, and affordable housing and medication, to name just a few. As the Minister for Industry, Trade & Tourism, she plans to continue this mission, now armed with the power to lead and institute policy reform from the front lines. Today, her work continues to be rooted by her mantra, \\"I am not against business, but against bad business.\\" As the head of the newly-realigned Ministry of Housing & Community Development, Ms. Kumar will leverage her extensive experience with landlord- tenant issues as a powerful proponent of affordable housing throughout Fiji, particularly in the nation's quickly-growing urban and peri-urban areas. Her background in environmentalism and sustainable development is progressing Government's mission to make Fijian communities more resilient to the effects of a changing climate. Within the Ministry of Local Government, Kumar is working to replicate the newfound transparency and accountability she brought to Fiji's businesses in the nation's many municipalities, pressing for a CEO- mentality from community leaders that will ensure every dollar of taxpayer money is both prudently allocated and accounted for. In the international arena, Kumar has continuously supported Consumers International's (CI) global work, and she has expanded Fiji's regional leadership by offering consumer affairs support, expertise, and training to Fiji's Pacific Island neighbours such as Vanuatu, Tonga and Kiribati.

Someruelos worked to continue the progressive policies of the former captain general of Cuba, Luis de Las Casas. He supported the introduction in 1803 of a smallpox vaccination program, and promoted public works such as the building of a theatre to encourage the arts, and of the Espada cemetery to improve sanitation. He encouraged social and cultural improvements in the country, and in 1800 and 1804 he was visited by the scientists Alexander von Humboldt and Aim√© Bonpland. Governor Someruelos, mindful of his duty to defend the Spanish colonies in the region of the Gulf of Mexico, rejected overtures by an expansionist United States to begin diplomatic negotiations when, during the height of the economic crisis in Cuba caused by the embargo of 1807, Thomas Jefferson sent Gen. James Wilkinson as an envoy to the Spanish authorities. Someruelos refused to meet him when he finally reached Havana in March 1809. Although he was appointed to his office by the Spanish Crown, Someruelos took the side of the criollo planters in Cuban politics, whose interests were often opposed to those of the administrative authorities in Metropolitan Spain. He brutally suppressed revolts by enslaved blacks on the island, and in 1812 ordered the hanging of the political activist Jos√© Antonio Aponte and fellow conspirators, as well as the public display of their decapitated heads. Early life Someruelos was born in Madrid on 6 October 1755, the son of Pedro Salvador de Muro y Alonso, from an old hidalgo family in La Rioja, and Teresa de Salazar y Morales, a native of Medinaceli. Although the thirdborn of eight brothers, he inherited the title of Marquis of Someruelos in 1777 (his father died in 1774) because the two eldest sons had consecrated themselves to the Church. His parents had previously determined that he should inherit the family patrimony, and to prepare for him a career suited to his position, they made generous contributions to the leadership of the Toro regiment's provincial militias. The young Someruelos was educated by the Jesuits at the Seminary of Nobles of Madrid (Seminario de Nobles de Madrid) and the cadet school of Avila (Colegio Militar de Avila). On 30 December 1769, at age fifteen, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the C√≥rdoba infantry regiment. Military career Someruelos had attained the rank of captain of infantry when he was promoted to lieutenant colonel of the Provincial Militia Regiment of Toro on 23 September 1783. He became a full colonel of militias on 22 September 1788. He married Mar√≠a de la Concepci√≥n de Vidaurreta y Llano, a native of Logro√±o, on 18 August 1791, and the couple moved into the Casa de los Chapiteles, a palace belonging to her family. During the War of the Pyrenees (1793‚Äì1795), which was effectively the Pyrenean front of the First Coalition's war against the First French Republic, Someruelos was sent to the front lines at Guip√∫zcoa as commander of arms in the first battalion. On 10 October, he was promoted to colonel of infantry. Leading over 1,000 grenadiers, he was one of the officers in charge of reconnaissance during the Spanish campaign of 1794, in which he commanded two divisions of advance troops, often under enemy fire. he was made a brevet brigadier by April 1795. After the Peace of Basel, signed on 22 July 1795, ended the War of the Pyrenees, Someruelos was promoted from colonel of militias to field marshal and assigned to the general staff of the Spanish Army at Navarre, enabling him to reside at his home in Logro√±o. His son Joaqu√≠n Jos√©, who became the 3rd Marquis of Someruelos, was born on 27 October 1797. In 1798, Someruelos was one of the officers in charge of organizing the campos volantes (flying camps) of Galicia, a mobile force ready to march against the British at any time. Captain General of Cuba and Governor of Havana Gen. Someruelos arrived in La Coru√±a on 3 December 1798 and went to Ferrol, where, although he had just taken the command of the campos volantes, he received orders to sail immediately for Cuba to assume office as captain general of Cuba. On his passage to Cuba, the mail ship carrying him, the brigantine P√°jaro, was pursued by corsairs, so that he had to disembark in Trinidad to escape and continue to Cuba from there. Traveling overland, he was detained at Nicol√°s Calvo's La Holanda sugar mill in G√ºines by a tropical storm, and reached the capital on 1 May. His commission included administration of the governments of Santiago de Cuba and Havana, as well as those of Spanish Louisiana and the Floridas. He was chosen to replace the Count of Santa Clara because of his reputation as a capable military leader who could defend the island against any foe. His term lasted 13 years, from 1799 to 1812, making him the longest- serving captain general in Cuba's colonial history. During his tenure, there occurred a series of memorable events, including: the slave revolts in Saint- Domingue which led to the withdrawal of France from the island of Hispaniola and the declaration of independence of Haiti in 1804; the War of the Third Coalition with its Battle of Trafalgar in 1805; the Peninsular War against the French invasion of 1808; the beginning of the Spanish-American independence movement the same year; and the enactment of the first Spanish constitution in 1812, his last year as captain general of Cuba. Someruelos oversaw the cession of the remaining Spanish part of the island of Hispaniola to France, one of the conditions of the Peace of Basel agreed in 1795. This transfer made necessary the relocation of the Royal Audiencia of Santo Domingo to Puerto Pr√≠ncipe, Cuba, ordered by the royal decree of 17 March 1799. The new Audiencia was established the following year and had jurisdiction over Cuba, Puerto Rico, Louisiana and Florida. In early February 1802, he granted a request for supplies and money to relieve the French expedition led by Napoleon's brother-in-law, Gen. Charles Leclerc, against the black and mulatto slave insurgents in Saint-Domingue. =Administrative accomplishments= As captain general of Cuba, Someruelos had determined early on in his administration to correct the deficiencies of the rule of his predecessor, the Count of Santa Clara, and to restore the progressive regime that had flourished under Luis de Las Casas. He encouraged social and cultural improvements in the country, and used the information provided by the expedition of the Royal Guant√°namo Commission (Real Comision de Guantanamo) of 1796-1802 to promote the island of Cuba; in 1800 and 1804 he was visited by the scientists Alexander von Humboldt and Aim√© Bonpland. As president of the Patriotic Society (Sociedad Econ√≥mica de los Amigos del Pa√≠s de la Habana), in 1804 Someruelos invited Humboldt to investigate the hills near Havana for any significant deposits of gold or silver. Humboldt reported finding no indication of their presence in the presentation of his results before the Society. When Havana was devastated in 1802 by fire and over 11,000 of the poorer inhabitants were made destitute, Someruelos became personally involved in efforts to aid them. He was interested in the improvement of architecture on the island, and promoted two important public works in Havana. The first, a public theatre, was built with the object of giving an impetus to the arts. The second, the Espada public cemetery, showed his interest in improving public sanitation. Executed by the Bishop of Havana, Juan Jos√© D√≠az de Espada, the cemetery was located in the Villa de San Crist√≥bal neighborhood, and was inaugurated on 2 February 1806. Covering about , the cemetery was built so that the dead might be interred in one place, rather than being buried in small plots on estates, in churches, or in the yards of residences. The walls, gateway and chapel of the burying-ground were good examples of the late neoclassical Cuban architecture of the period; the mortuary chapel contained a well-executed fresco depicting the Resurrection. Someruelos supported the introduction in 1803 of a smallpox vaccination program designed and overseen by the Cuban Criollo (Creole) doctor, Tom√°s Romay, and put all the island's governmental institutions and communications at the service of his mission, which coincided with the arrival in Cuba of the Real Expedici√≥n Filantr√≥pica de la Vacuna (Royal Philanthropic Vaccine Expedition), directed by Francisco Javier de Balmis, a Spanish physician who led the expedition to Spanish America to vaccinate the populations against smallpox. Cuban planters, represented by lawyer, politician, and planter Francisco de Arango as their spokesperson, petitioned the government to exempt coffee, cotton and sugar from all taxes, including duties, sales taxes (alcabalas), and church tithes. This was finally achieved in 1804. Exemptions were also granted for the importation of enslaved Africans and machinery for the sugarcane industry. =Wartime and economic crisis= With the resumption of the Anglo-Spanish War in 1804, and the consequent breakdown of regular communications with peninsular Spain, Someruelos was often left to his own devices in executing his office. When news of the invasion of the Iberian Peninsula by Napoleon's armies reached Cuba, he approved a petition for the formation of a Cuban junta subordinate to the Junta Suprema Central in Spain, and asked Tom√°s de la Cruz Mu√±√≥z on 26 July 1808 to discuss the proposed \\"Junta Superior de Gobierno\\" with Ayuntamiento members and solicit their opinion, but the proposal was met with little enthusiasm. Thereafter Someruelos acted to ensure that the territories under his command remained in Spanish control. Because the war with Great Britain, and then with France, had disrupted the Cuban economy, the Ministry of the Indies (Ministerio de Indias) and the King had approved Someruelos's authorization of the trade with neutral parties, most of which was with ports in the United States, but only as a necessity imposed by the war. The same ship that brought from Spain the official notice of peace also bore the royal order to suspend the foreign commerce. Contrary to the policy of the Metropolitan authorities, Someruelos continued to support the illicit traffic and consequently clashed with the successive intendants (intendentes), who supervised the treasury and the collection of taxes. Appointed directly by the Crown, they had fiscal powers that gave them a say in almost all administrative, ecclesiastical and military matters. Intendant Luis de Viguri (1798-1803), a protege of Manuel Godoy, had many bitter disputes with Someruelos and with members of his own staff before he was recalled. Someruelos's relationship with the intendendants was complicated by the fact that they had official control of the captaincy's finances, but also unofficially represented the commercial interests of the merchants in Spain and their special trading privileges. Besides these concerns, he had to manage as well the economic crisis on the island that began when the United States declared an embargo in 1807. =Political intrigues in Cuba= In 1808 Someruelos readied Cuba's defenses for a rumoured invasion of the island by Great Britain and issued a proclamation, signed 27 January, announcing these preparations and urging inhabitants to defend the island if necessary. The expected invasion, however, never materialized. The same year, the captaincy general assisted the Spanish troops in the reconquest of Santo Domingo. Thomas Jefferson sent the disreputable and corrupt Gen. James Wilkinson as an envoy to the Spanish authorities in Cuba, during the height of the economic crisis caused by the embargo. Jefferson, who desired that the United States should ultimately possess the Floridas, hoped to establish friendly diplomatic relations with the Spaniards to forestall France or Great Britain from gaining political or commercial control of the region around the Gulf of Mexico, especially the Spanish colonies of Cuba and Mexico. Charged with containing the Pan-American imperialism of the United States, and having heard that Wilkinson had proposed a toast at a banquet in Norfolk to \\"the New World governed by itself and independent of the Old\\", Someruelos refused to meet him when he finally arrived in Havana on 22 March 1809 (after Jefferson's administration had ended). The United States subsequently supported the revolts against Spanish rule in Baton Rouge and Mobile in West Florida, although support in those areas for the rebellion was hardly unanimous. There were competing pro-Spanish, pro-American, and pro-independence factions, as well as scores of foreign agents, and it eventually fell under US rule in December 1810. By 1808 Someruelos had \\"begun to exile French citizens‚Äîincluding emigrants from Saint Domingue‚Äîfrom Havana as a precaution against Napoleonic intrigues in that city.\\" In 1809 there were riots in Santiago and Havana against local French-Haitian √©migr√© business interests. The first proposals for Cuban national independence were made the same year, and on 27 October, pamphlets critical of the Spanish authorities appeared in Puerto Principe, for which Diego Antonio del Castillo Betancourt, twice mayor of Puerto Pr√≠ncipe and a former navy captain, was arrested and prosecuted for the crime of reo de lesa majestad. Joseph Bonaparte, the brother of Napoleon and usurper of the Spanish throne, wanting to gain the support of the Spanish American colonies, had sent agents using false identities to the United States with the purpose of infiltrating the colonies in the Antilles and in continental North America. Among them was a French-born young man of Mexican nationality, Manuel Rodr√≠guez Alem√°n. His mission was discovered by spies in the service of Luis de On√≠s, the Spanish envoy to the United States in charge of the Spanish legation in Philadelphia. Consequently, On√≠s bribed the captain of the Spanish brigantine San Antonio on which Alem√°n embarked in Norfolk for Campeche. Alleging the need to stop first in Havana for repairs to the ship, the captain delivered his hapless passenger to Governor Someruelos on 18 July 1810. Alem√°n's luggage was seized, and then was opened in the presence of Someruelos, who summoned a carpenter to dismantle a chest in which were found papers addressed to the Spanish authorities in Cuba and the rest of Spanish colonial America, a copy of the Bayonne Constitution intended to be delivered to the Audiencia of Puerto Principe, and documents highlighting the successes of Napoleon's armies in Spain. On 30 July 1810, Alem√°n was condemned as guilty of high treason and hanged in Havana. On 4 October 1810, the so-called ‚ÄúMasonic Conspiracy of 1810‚Äù was thwarted. This affair involved the Cuban separatists Rom√°n de la Luz, a prominent landowner, and Joaqu√≠n Infante, a lawyer from Bayamo, both of whom were active Masons who advocated radical political ideas from Europe. In 1812, Infante, living in Caracas, wrote his \\"Constitutional Project for the Island of Cuba\\", a political constitution for a future Cuban nation, and was imprisoned by the Spanish authorities for his writings. Available in English as Later years On 15 July 1810, there arrived in Havana the royal order of April 16 appointing the captain general of the Balearic Islands, Lt. Gen. Jos√© de Heredia, to the captaincy general of Cuba, as well as the presidency of the Audiencia and the governorship of Havana. Someruelos, however, remained in office even after his replacement had arrived in the capital, and on 6 September 1810 he again received the royal order to surrender his office. Mainly because of the representations made in his favor by the Real Consulado and the cabildo of Havana, the Regency Council (Consejo de Regencia) reviewed his record as governor and confirmed him for another five years. On January 30, 1811, Someruelos received notice of the extension of his administrative tenure. Someruelos brutally suppressed the anti-slavery revolt led by the Yoruba political activist Jos√© Antonio Aponte, who was inspired by rumors of the debates concerning the abolition of slavery taking place in the Cortes of C√°diz. On 19 March 1812, Aponte and eight other conspirators were arrested, and after three weeks of interrogation were executed by hanging on 8 April; the next day his body was decapitated and his head put on public display in a cage. Thirty three slaves and free persons of color were hanged. These events took place in the social context of a plantation society dependent on slave labor for its very existence; consequently the powerful sugar planters defended the institution of slavery in Cuba with vigor. When Someruelos was finally relieved of his command on 14 April 1812 by Juan Ruiz de Apodaca, Lieutenant General of the Army and the Navy, the island was at peace. While still in Havana, Someruelos received his appointment on 2 July 1812 as a councillor of the Tribunal especial de Guerra y Marina. Two acute attacks of gout and the danger of a passage on the high seas during wartime prevented his leaving Havana until 13 April 1813. After an uneventful voyage he arrived on 18 May in C√°diz, and took his seat in the Tribunal on 26 May. In October he moved to Madrid with his wife and son, staying at his mother's house, from where he tried to reorganize his holdings, which had been damaged in the war. Now surrounded by his family and a chosen society, he enjoyed the first quiet period in his career. On the night of 13 December, moments after having drunk some chocolate at a gathering with former comrades in arms and distinguished guests, he had a stroke and died within a few hours, only 58 years old. Baselessly, some people attributed his death to the effects of a poison given him in revenge for the torture and hanging of Manuel Rodr√≠guez Alem√°n in Havana. According to the posthumous eulogy made in 1814 by Francisco Filomeno, \\"Know everything, pretend much, punish little\\" was Someruelos's personal motto of conduct. It is not known how Someruelos might have reconciled these sentiments with his issuing of orders to torture and execute numerous persons accused of political crimes. Filomeno said of him: \\"without pride or ostentation, simple in his speech as in his habits, he was unknown to his own eyes and ignored the rights he had to public esteem.\\"  See also  History of Cuba Captaincy General of Cuba List of colonial governors of Cuba ReferencesExternal links * Muro y Salazar, Salvador marqu√©s de Someruelos 1754-1813 Cuban politicians ","title":"Salvador Jos√© de Muro, 2nd Marquis of Someruelos"},{"id":"59136165","text":"The Korean Cultural Center, Mexico City (Spanish: Centro Cultural Coreano, Ciudad de M√©xico, hangul: ÌïúÍµ≠Î¨∏ÌôîÏõê,Î©ïÏãúÏΩî ÏãúÌã∞), is a non-profit Korean language and cultural exchange center in Polanco, Mexico City. It is supported by the South Korean Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism and run by their KOCIS organization. The center opened on March 13, 2012, the twenty-third opened worldwide and the fourth in North America; and coincided with the 50th anniversary celebration of diplomatic ties between South Korea and Mexico. With an approximate 30,000 K-pop fans in Mexico City, at the time, the Ministry projected that the new center would \\"combine forces with them to spread K-pop to all over the country and play a role as a bridge between the two cultures\\". History and background=2012 opening and other centers= On March 10, 2012, the center held a pre-opening event in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the 1962 diplomatic relations established with Mexico, and included performances of samul nori, fusion gugak, breakdancing and taekwondo. The March 13 opening was attended by South Korean Ambassador to Mexico, Hong Seong-heo, the Secretariat of Tourism's Assistant Secretary of Planning, Jorge Mezher Rage the Minister of Culture, Sports and Tourism Choe Kwang-shik, the National Council for Culture and Arts President Consuelo S√°izar, and about 200 dignitaries from both countries. The Polanco location, the 23rd cultural center established worldwide and the fourth in North America; was preceded by the February opening of one in Hungary, and followed by a June opening in India. To the south, the first South American center was opened in Buenos Aires, Argentina in 2006, and in S√£o Paulo, Brazil in 2013. By October 2018, there were 32 centers worldwide in 27 countries, with seven centers in the Americas - Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, and three in the U.S. (Korean Cultural Center, Los Angeles, Korean Cultural Center New York, and Washington, D.C.). =Korean culture in Mexico City= KCON Mexico 2017, Mexican-Coreano good will ambassadors. The first recorded large-scale migration of Koreans to Mexico was a boat of 1,000 that sailed from Incheon in 1905, to the port of Salina Cruz. By 2003, the National Institute of Migration reported 15,000 South Koreans residing in Mexico, about 8,000 in the capital, with most of them in Tepito, a high crime area known as \\"barrio bravo\\" or the \\"wild neighbourhood\\", and also running businesses in the Zona Rosa. In September, 2013, The New York Times reported that the Korean center calculated 12,000 Koreans living in Mexico. In January, 2011, Cynthia Arvide, a Mexican writer for Chilango described her attempts, and failure, to interview a Korean business woman in the Zona Rosa area, between Chapultepec and Reforma, partially due to the language barrier. She wrote, \\"I discovered that the little Korea of the DF (Distrito Federal) is a trip to the other side of the world without leaving home\\", and \\"Its inhabitants do not speak or write like us, they do not eat the same thing, they listen to another type of music and they watch soap operas where no one kisses\\". Time Out's Alberto Acu√±a welcomed the Mexico City center in 2013, a year after its opening, referencing the existing \\"Little Seoul\\" (Peque√±o Se√∫l) neighberhood of the Zona Rosa, which had already been a tourist attraction for a decade due to its restaurants and entertainment. He said the cultural center had added \\"an attractive agenda of artistic activities (exhibitions, traditional music concerts, craft fairs) and academics (language and history courses). South Korean)\\", and premiers of blockbuster films and those by Kim Ki-duk and Bong Joon-ho. The center's founding Director Seo Nam-gyo said that one of the center's main activities would be to teach the Korean language to Mexican children, youths and adults. In April, 2017, Eva Oca√±a Islas of the School of High Studies (FES) Acatl√°n and Fabi√°n Robles, Director of the Asociaci√≥n Cultural para la Investigaci√≥n sobre Asia (ACIA) included the center's Sejong Institute in their list of Korean language programs (also with TOPIK) available in and around Mexico City, along with older programs, such as one at Escuela Nacional de Lenguas, Ling√º√≠stica y Traducci√≥n which began teaching Korean in 1995, and another at ACIA which started in 2003. In October, 2017, two of the center's teachers spoke about their transition to life in Mexico in interviews with K-Magazine, which reports on Korean culture in Mexico and Latin America. Choi Hee-jung, a Korean language teacher at the center's Sejong Institute, in Mexico since 1996, said that one of the first barriers was speaking the Spanish language, which she knew, but was not fluent in. Oh Jung-a, a gastronomy teacher at the center, moved to Mexico in 2011, and also had to learn Spanish. She described the similarities of Mexicans wrapping food with tortillas and Koreans wrapping food with leaves of vegetables. Coffee Kkot, corner of Hamburgo and Florencia, Peque√±o Se√∫l, 2017 =2016 first festival held= On December 3‚Äì4, 2016, the center and the Mexico City government held the first Korean culture festival in the Zona Rosa, in Peque√±o Se√∫l, with support from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and KOCIS. The main stage was set up between Hamburgo and Genova streets and events included samu nori, taekwondo demonstrations, K-pop music and a piano concert. Street stalls displayed Korean food, Korean calligraphy, Korean Art, hanbok, hanji and baduk. Writer Susan Velasquez applauded the Mexico City government's recognition of the Korean community's efforts and abilities to attract tourists and the cultural exchange between Mexicans and Koreans, but called the effects limited, \\"After the Korean stalls and vendors that clearly marked the presence of Peque√±o Se√∫l were taken down, the space returned to being one part of Zona Rosa, a part that is a fragmented landscape of Korean symbols scattered along the streets\\". Effects of hallyu=Selection of Mexico City= The selection of Mexico City and other cities for the location of new centers in 2012 were determined partly by a calculated tracking of hallyu and its financial effects on South Korea. KOCIS Director Seo Kang-soo said the \\"ripple effect of K-Pop fever is expanding as a growing number of youths in Latin America, Europe and the U.S. can enjoy Korean songs and music videos through You Tube\\". He also said KOCIS realizes the strengthening of soft power through culture. A Korea Customs Service report, that compared South Korea's export growth rates in hallyu countries to non- hallyu countries during the 2005-2010 period, showed growth in hallyu countries. The Latin American hallyu countries of Mexico, Peru and Brazil showed high percentages of growth; while non-hallyu countries Guatemala, Colombia and Venezuela did not. The ministry said the hallyu popularity of K-pop and Korean dramas had grown in Europe and America in 2011, and centers would be set up in developing countries which had the greater demands. However, critics have questioned what kind of national brand is being portrayed by using hallyu, and the effects, if any, of soft power's socio- political benefits; but remain optimistic for a short-term economic impact. The Latin American country with the oldest cultural center, Argentina, hosted its first K-pop contest in October, 2010, with fans from ten different Latin American countries participating. In the Mexico City center's opening year, 2012, the ministry said there were already more than 30,000 fans of Korean pop culture in the city. In September, 2013, The New York Times reported there were 70 fan clubs for Korean pop music in Mexico, with at least 60,000 members. In April, 2018, Chilango magazine reported that Mexico was second only to Chile with the number of K-pop fans, and had held concerts for bands such as Super Junior, Red Velvet and Exo. =K-pop academy and world K-pop dance contests= On June 7, 2016, the center announced a training course that would give fans a chance to see what it would be like to be a Korean pop star (Korean idol), dubbed the \\"K-pop Academy\\". Sponsored by the ministry, it was offered at the center and the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes. Howon University, in charge of the 10-week training program, selected professional vocal trainers and choreographers who had worked with top groups like TVXQ, JYJ and Girls' Generation; and over 400 applicants applied for 40 available spots. The center hosts annual global singing and dance competitions whose finalists travel to Seoul for final competitions; the K-Pop World Festival for a number of years, and K-pop Cover Dance Festival for the second time in 2018.

The village hosted 125 houses and only 10 inhabitants. The village is thought to have been used as a place of exile for criminals or those who angered authorities, among many theories.

Living on the waterways or among them, create a kind of ethnic core that distinguishes these people from others\\". As a result of her expedition, in 1937 in New York she published a photo album entitled Polish Province (Polish Countryside). The village was left untouched by war due to its remote location. During the Second World War, German soldiers burned a neighboring village; Kudrichi was not touched for unknown reasons. By order of Nikita Khrushchev, a tractor driver destroyed an 18th century church in the village.

Background After re-conquering the city of Laodicea from a Seljuq Turkish garrison of 700 men in 1119, the Byzantine emperor John II Komnenos continued his campaigns against the Turks in 1120 after a brief stay in Constantinople. The 1120 campaign target was the town of Sozopolis in Pisidia, which controlled the lines of communication to Attaleia. Siege Sozopolis was protected by an armed garrison and steep hills. A large-scale siege attack was thus impossible. The town could only be attacked by small forces. John was initially at a loss how to proceed but later came up with a plan. He ordered a force of missile-armed armed cavalry under Paktiarios and Dekanos to attack the town gates and shoot at the Turkish soldiers manning the walls. The Turks took the bait and poured out of the gate. The Byzantine force then executed a planned retreat, drawing the Turks far out beyond the town. The rest of the Byzantine army had lain hidden in the thick undergrowth and assaulted the undefended town after the Turks had passed them. The fleeing Byzantines turned about and faced the pursuing Turks. The Turks were trapped between the Byzantine cavalry to their front and the army to their back and were largely killed or captured, with a handful making it out of the encirclement. Aftermath Next, the fortress of Hierakokoryphitis capitulated to John without a fight, along with many other towns and fortifications near Attaleia, after which John returned to Constantinople. =Analysis= The combat at Sozopolis demonstrated the discipline of the Byzantine troops, who could feign flight without panicking. The Byzantine cavalry could fight effectively with both missile and close-combat weapons. John showed himself a competent general, carrying out a complex tactical maneuver at the very beginning of his reign.

He is a member of the Democratic Party. Early life and career Cox was born in Walnut Creek, California. His father is a chemical engineering professor who immigrated from China, and his mother is from the Philippines. He received a Bachelor of Science in chemical engineering from the University of Nevada, Reno in 1986 and a Master of Business Administration from Southern Methodist University. He started two businesses that process nuts and also managed a community development enterprise. U.S. House of Representatives= Elections = 2018  Cox previously ran for the United States House of Representatives in in the 2006 election, losing to incumbent George Radanovich.https://www.fresnobee.com/news/politics-government/politics- columns-blogs/political-notebook/article203632719.html In the 2018 elections, Cox again ran for the United States House of Representatives, this time in . Cox began this congressional bid in 2017, competing in California's 10th district primary race against several other Democratic candidates. However, Emilio Huerta, the only Democratic challenger in the 21st district, withdrew from the race prior to the filing deadline to appear on the primary election ballot. Cox withdrew from the 10th district race to instead run in the 21st district against incumbent Representative David Valadao. He and Valadao advanced from the June 5 top-two primary election to the November 6 general election. On election night, and for several days after the election, Valadao had more votes, but Cox's vote count pulled into the lead on November 26. By November 28, major news sources called the race for Cox, with Valadao conceding the race the following week. Cox's victory was considered an upset, as most election forecasters rated Valadao as the favorite. Cox won by a narrow 862 vote margin.  2020  Cox is running for reelection in 2020, and Valadao will challenge Cox in an attempt to reclaim his former seat. In October 2020, Cox's campaign acknowledged fabricating a tweet to make it appear as if David Valadao had retweeted a message from President Trump saying \\"California is going to hell. Vote Trump!\\" = Committee assignments = * Committee on Agriculture ** Subcommittee on Livestock and Foreign Agriculture ** Subcommittee on Biotechnology, Horticulture, and Research * Committee on Natural Resources ** Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations (Chair) ** Subcommittee on Water, Oceans and Wildlife =Special access to Yosemite= In June 2020, amid COVID-19 lockdowns, Cox pushed to gain preferential access into Yosemite National Park over the July 4 weekend. He requested two vehicle passes from the U.S. Department of Interior. At the time, Yosemite was only dispersing vehicle passes via a public lottery system. His initial request to circumvent the lottery system was denied due to government ethics rules. When he changed the stated purpose of his visit from personal to professional, saying he would be conducting official business while at the park, he was granted the passes. During his visit to the park, he filmed a short video of himself hiking that he shared with a group called Backcountry Hunters & Anglers, a group that supported the Great American Outdoors Act. = Financial controversies = When Cox made an updated financial disclosure in 2019, it was discovered that he had failed to disclose business interests as a candidate in 2018. It was also discovered that Cox failed to timely pay wages owed to three employees of Constellation Mines, a company where Cox was a director until early 2019. These obligations were not disclosed when Cox ran for Congress in 2018. In March 2020, Cox voted against a bill that would require members of Congress to disclose tax liens. In January 2020, the IRS placed a tax lien on Cox for approximately $87,000 in unpaid income tax for 2016 and approximately $57,000 in unpaid income tax for 2017. Cox was also subject to a $50,000 IRS tax lien in 2017, which Cox claims was the result of his check being stuck to the back of someone else's payment.

It was built during 1851 by persons unknown and redeveloped in 1985 by the Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority with Co-Wyn Construction. It is also known as Kathmandu (current) and Beach Culture and Dorian Scott (former). Property NSW, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002.  History  This portion of land was part of Sydney's hospital garden between 1780 and 1816. Elizabeth Broughton was registered as claimant for this allotment No. 11 in 1834 and in 1840 she was granted the property. During 1841 she subdivided the grant into four parts and advertised them for auction. The land remained vacant, serving as a passageway to Harrington Place until 1851, when Isaac Stansfield erected a shop on the site. The Municipal Council of Sydney Rate Books of 1858 listed George Thorne as the owner. The property was described as a shop and dwelling with stone and brick walls and a timber shingled roof. It was three storeys high with a basement and had six rooms. Thomas Playfair occupied the shop from 1861 until 1869, when he moved his butchery two doors north. The shop remained vacant while G. Thorne installed a slate roof to the building and in 1870 the \\"American Hotel\\" commenced operations with John Kelly as licensee. However, during 1872 the \\"American Hotel\\" relocated to the corner of Argyle and George Streets, and the \\"Union Hotel\\" commenced operations. In 1875 the Sands Directory listed Michael Cross as the occupant, retailing dairy products. In 1879 the shop functioned as a hotel again, named the \\"Sydney & Newcastle\\", with Joseph Spora the manager. Six years later, Louis Dupont became the manager and changed the hotel's name to \\"Messageries des Maritimes\\". Joseph Emmanuel became the licensee during 1886 and remained so until 1892, when the hotel was converted into a bird and animal shop run by dealer H. Sames.SCRA 1978: HP/16 By 1896 the site was being used as a grocer's and it continued in this use until 1920. It continued to be used for commercial/retail uses throughout the 1930s including by a confectioner and a dressmaker. Throughout this period of use the upper floor appears generally to have been used as a residence, with a separate entrance, and for short periods was used as a second commercial tenancy. Commercial use continued into the 1980s, including a period of use as an architect's office from the early 1970s until the reconstruction of the site in 1985. 105 George Street was completely demolished and reconstructed in 1985 due to structural instability. Due to this, there is almost no original fabric left on site to analyse. While documentation used in the planning of the reconstruction indicates certain components from the original building fa√ßade were reused in the reconstruction, these represent minor elements of the entire building.

In November 1841, land was vacant with passageway across it.  Description  105 George Street is an example of a simple late Georgian building of three storeys, somewhat lower than the adjacent buildings. Built in 1853, it has a timber shopfront (which appears to be original), two twelve pane windows on the first floor and two small six pane windows on the second floor. The simple projecting sills providing minimal decoration. A six panel door to one side leads to the offices upstairs.National Trust 1977 Style: Georgian (Original) - Post Modern Victorian (1985 addition); Storeys: 3 + basement (1851) - two (1985); Facade: Brick walls; Roof Cladding: Corrugated Iron; Floor Frame: Timber. the premises housed a retail outlet of the Kathmandu chain. = Condition = As at 23 July 2001, 1984-85: Due to structural problems in the upper floors, the George Street fa√ßade was reconstructed in its 1851 configuration, using documentary and physical evidence.

The site and building are also of State heritage significance for their contribution to The Rocks area which is of State Heritage significance in its own right. 105 George Street is a reconstructed, typical example of a simple 19th century shop and residence. The building has been used for commercial purposes for more than 150 years. The building makes an important contribution to the surrounding 19th century commercial precinct and contributes to the character of the surrounding area of The Rocks. 105 George Street, The Rocks was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. 105 George Street is important for its part in the development of this area of The Rocks as a commercial precinct in the 19th century. This area was the commercial hub of Sydney in the mid 19th century and has continued to serve as a major commercial precinct for nearly 200 years. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. 105 George Street is a simple but aesthetically pleasing reconstruction of a 19th-century commercial building which is generally true to its original design. The building makes an important contribution to the surrounding 19th century commercial streetscape. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. As the building at 105 George Street is a reconstruction with almost no original fabric, it has little potential to provide insight into any particular aspect of the building's design or construction. The site has limited archaeological potential which may contribute to an understanding of the late 18th and early 19th century hospital uses of the surrounding precinct. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The building at 105 George Street is a reconstructed typical example of a 19th-century shop and residence. It is one of a number of similar buildings in The Rocks precinct. While it makes an important contribution to the streetscape and the precinct, the building itself does not have any unique characteristics. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. 105 George Street is a typical example of a simple early Victorian multistorey shop and residence building that was common throughout Sydney in the 19th century. Numerous more original examples of this style of building exist throughout Sydney. As a contributory element to The Rocks precinct, it is important in demonstrating the development of The Rocks as a commercial precinct in the mid 19th century.

He is a recipient of several awards and honours, including the Jamnalal Bajaj Award for 'Application of Science and Technology for Rural Development'. He was instrumental in setting up Eklavya foundation in 1982. For over a decade, he was Professor of Education at Delhi University, and headed its Department of Education during 1998-2001. Since 2004-2005, he has been campaigning for changes in the RTE Act, which he believes is flawed.  Early life  Anil Sadgopal's father taught chemical technology at Banaras Hindu University while his mother was a homemaker. He studied in Birla Vidya Mandir, Nainital, and St. Stephen's College, Delhi. He obtained his Master's degree in plant physiology from the Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi. In 1961 he went to the California Institute of Technology for doctoral studies in biochemistry and molecular biology.  Career  After completing his Ph.D., Sadgopal returned to India in 1968. He held the post of Fellow at Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), Bombay, during 1968-1971. = Kishore Bharati and the inception of HSTP = In 1971, Sadgopal resigned from TIFR and set up Kishore Bharati, an NGO with its headquarters at Palia Piparia, a village in Hoshangabad district of Madhya Pradesh. The organisation set out to work in the areas of health and agriculture, as well as education. For example, it promoted low-cost irrigation techniques and worked to spread awareness of animal husbandry. It was recognised by UNEP for its environmentally-sound practices. Sadgopal's work in school education began in 1972, with the Hoshangabad Science Teaching Programme (HSTP). This was a project which aimed to improve the teaching of science in grades 6-8 of government schools in Hoshangabad district. Initially it ran as a pilot project in 16 rural schools, and was jointly managed by Kishore Bharati and another NGO called Friends' Rural Centre. Because of his academic background, Sadgopal was able to rope in scientists from TIFR and other institutions of higher education and research - particularly Delhi University - as members of the core resource group of HSTP. In 1978 the Government of Madhya Pradesh adopted the programme officially and extended it to all middle schools (grades 6-8) of Hoshangabad district. = Bhopal = With the setting up of Eklavya in 1982, the intervention that began with HSTP entered a new phase, and Sadgopal ceased to be involved in the day-to-day running of HSTP. Following the Bhopal gas leak tragedy in December 1984, he moved on to a different level of activism, working to secure justice for the gas leak victims. He set up a body called Zahreeli Gas Kand Sangharsh Morcha (Poisonous Gas Affair Struggle Front), which organised conferences, rallies etc. When the Acharya Ramamurti Committee was constituted in 1990 to review the National Education Policy of 1980, Anil Sadgopal was nominated as one of the members. However, he resigned from the committee in protest against what he perceived as the government's \\"backtracking on the goal of universalisation of elementary education\\". = Delhi = Sadgopal moved to Delhi in 1992. During this period he researched and wrote a book on assassinated trade unionist Shankar Guha Niyogi. In 1994, he joined the University of Delhi as Professor of Education. During 1998-2001, he was Head, Department of Education. He was also Senior Fellow at the Nehru Memorial Museum and Library (2001-2006). From the 1980s, Sadgopal has been increasingly involved in the people's science movement in India. During 1993-2002, he was the National Convener of Bharat Jan Vigyan Jatha, an all India people‚Äôs science network. = The RTE act = In 2004, Sadgopal was inducted as a member of the Central Advisory Board of Education (CABE), the highest advisory body to the Government in matters related to education. During 2004-2005 he was a member of three CABE committees, including the committee which was to draft the RTE Bill. In July 2005, when the draft was presented at a full meeting of CABE, Sadgopal circulated a note, alleging that the draft prepared by the committee had been changed in a major way, diluting the provisions of the proposed act. The Government dismissed it as his personal view, and he resigned from the committee. Subsequently he has been involved in a campaign to modify the RTE Act and bring in a common school system. He was one of the founders of the All India Forum for Right to Education, set up in 2009, and is a member of its presidium.

It was designed and built in two stages: in 1864 by Weaver & Kemp and in 1926 by Spain & Cosh. It is also known as the former Marionette Theatre and The Rocks Heritage and Information Centre. The property is owned by Property NSW, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002.  History  Sydney Sailors' Home, undated. In 1860, the Colonial Government decided to grant the Committee of the Sydney Sailors' Home a site at Circular Quay. The original site was once a series of sandstone ledges and a sandy beach. It extended both to the north and to the south of the present boundaries, to include Cadman's Cottage, and a portion of the land on which the former City Coroner's Court now stands. The Water Police used the site from 1846‚Äì53, and renovated Cadman's Cottage for use as a court with jail cells. The Dead House (morgue) was constructed at the northern end of the site. The location was considered suitable for the Home as it was close to the Quay and to the recently established Mariners Church. The Home had its origins in a benevolent movement dedicated to the elevation of the Sailors' condition and character, and by the 1860s such institutions were considered essential to any sizeable British port. It provided clean, comfortable and inexpensive board and lodging for sailors and other persons of all nationalities employed in sea-going ships and vessels. Architects Messrs. Weaver and Kemp of 181 Pitt Street Sydney were appointed and by April 1860, Kemp had produced an extensive design, similar in form, scale and proportion to that of the Brunswick Maritime Establishment in London's Docklands. The northern wing was completed in 1864 and the building made provision for the future construction of Weaver & Kemp's extensive scheme. The building stood four storeys high. The sandstone basement contained kitchen and dining facilities. The storeys above were brickwork with sandstone detailing to the window sills, corbels, arched heads and string courses. A bequest in 1916 enabled the Carss Wing to be added to the Home, and in 1925 Sydney City Council approved plans for a major extension designed by Spain & Cosh. An L-shaped structure, the new wing, completed in 1926, abutted the 1864 building and presented a Federation Free Classical facade to George Street. The history of the Sailors' Home is inextricably linked with the adjacent Cadmans Cottage. The first Superintendent restored the Cottage as a residence in 1865 and it was used as such until 1926, when the new extension to the Home provided a residence for the Superintendent and his family. The cottage was used as an overflow for sailors accommodation until the late 1950s, when it was vacated and fell into disrepair. In 1970, the Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority resumed the site. Cadmans Cottage was gazetted under the National Parks and Wildlife Act as an Historic Site. About this time, sailors' wages increased dramatically, and with this their expectations of standard of accommodation, so attendance at the home dropped. In 1980‚Äì81, plans were prepared by Hall, Bowe and Webber Pty Ltd Architects to adapt the building for use by the Marionette Theatre of Australia, approved by Council in 1983. This work involved substantial structural changes and the removal of significant fabric. This use ceased in the later 1980s. In 1993 conservation works were completed by the Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority reversing many of the 1983 changes and the Heritage and Information Centre opened in the building in the following year. Later this was replaced with the Sydney Visitor Centre. In 1995, level 1 and part of level two were adapted to restaurant use and leased to a private operator. In 2005 the Sydney Visitor centre moved out of the building. The building now houses a Charles Billich commercial art gallery. Billich was named Artist of the 1996 Summer Olympics. He is the recipient of the 2000 Sport Artist of the Year Award presented annually by the American Sport Art Museum and Archives. He was named Designated Artist 2001 Centenary Nobel Peace Prize. Inspired by his work entitled The Beijing Cityscape, the official image for the successful Beijing bid to host the 2008 Olympic Games, Billich conceived a series of images based on the Bing Ma Yong Terracotta warriors. The Bing Ma Yong images are represented on a collection of 16 postage stamps currently in circulation in China.  Description  The building known as The Sailor's Home currently stands as two attached structures located on the eastern side of George Street. A four-storey L-shaped block fronts George Street returning along the northern side of the site to partially enclose a rectangular block of similar height. The L-shaped block is finished in Classical Revival style whilst the rectangular block features Romanesque style window openings and associated stringer courses. A continuous parapet in Classical Revival style links the blocks.Bligh Robinson 1990: Chapter 2 ;Style *1864 Victorian Italianate *1926 Inter-War Free Classical *Four storeys ;Roof Cladding *1863 Slate *1926 Membrane ;Floor Frame *Timber = Condition = As at 7 December 1999, good physical condition. Archaeology Assessment Condition: Mostly disturbed. Assessment Basis: Floors terraced into hill slope from Circular Quay West. Sandstone bedrock visible on side adjacent to Cadman's Cottage. Investigation: Watching Brief. = Modifications and dates = In 1926 major additions were carried out to the building. An L-shaped addition was added along the George Street (west) side and north side of the building, almost doubling its volume. The gabled roof of the 1870s rectangular building was removed and the whole roof was made flat, behind parapets. In 1983 the 200 seat Marionette Theatre was opened following conversion for an auditorium, foyers, rehearsal rooms and workshops involving substantial structural changes and incorporation of stringent fire requirements, costing over $0.5m. The mezzanine gallery and its supporting structure was removed at this time. During its adaptation as The Rocks Heritage and Information Centre (later Sydney Visitor Centre) in 1991-3, the mezzanine gallery, its supporting columns and a sailor's cubicle in the 1880s block were reinstated. This work was based on documentary and physical evidence. Adaptations included an internal stair linking the gallery levels 2, 3, and 4, and the commercial kitchens and restaurant fitouts on level 1 and level two in the north western corner. The Heritage Centre exhibition and retail fit-out in 1993 and subsequent additions to the fitout in 1996 and 1998 were designed to be reversible.SCRA Annual Report 1984: 8 The building was again refurbished in 2006 for use as an art gallery.  Heritage listing  As at 31 March 2011, the Sydney Sailors' Home and site are of State heritage significance for their historical and scientific cultural values. The site and building are also of State heritage significance for their contribution to The Rocks area which is of State Heritage significance in its own right. The Sailors' Home is significant primarily because it provides an important historical record of changing attitudes to social welfare in the 19th and 20th centuries. The building fabric records the foundation and changing operation of a comfortable home ashore for transiting sailors of all nationalities. The physical fabric retains evidence of the meagre expectations of the working class, in particular seamen, during 19th century, and through its expansion and ongoing use provides evidence of a continuing acceptance of these standards, well into the 20th century. Internally and externally, sufficient detailed fabric remains to provide a physical record of the building's earliest use. The fabric and history of the Sailors' Home records changing social values of the 20th century, with the construction and subsequent removal of racially segregated facilities, and with the eventual lapse of interest in the Home following the reassessment of seamen's wages in the 1970s. The construction of the 1860s block as part of a grand overall scheme highlights both an awareness of the growing importance of Sydney in the mid 19th century, and a competitive desire to match the \\"mother country\\" amongst the Colony's citizenry. This desire is further evidenced in the original design through its obvious derivation from a British model. The Sailors' Home is thus a good illustration of Australia's dependence on British architectural trends at that time. The history and significance of the Sailors' Home is inextricably linked with its location. The Home's long association with Cadman's Cottage, The Mariners' Church, Circular Quay and the general fabric of The Rocks area (and in particular the hotels), render the building historically significant. The original Sailors' Home, designed by Weaver & Kemp is one of the earliest Sydney examples of the Romanesque Revival Style. The 1920s additions by Spain & Cosh are a remarkable example of contextual design.Bligh Robinson 1990: Chapter 5Duyker, S. 1999.

The 1985 additions to the rear were designed by Kell & Rigby. The property was built in 1920. It is also known as Captain Tench Arcade (since 1985). The property is owned by Property NSW, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002.  History  This land was part of the first hospital complex serving the early colony. The second brick ward/store was erected on this site. After the hospital moved in 1816, the land remained vacant. William Charles was granted the land in 1842 when he divided it into three lots, however he appears to have control of it from the 1830s. A brick building was initially built on the southern portion of the site in 1832 by Elizabeth Charles. Charles' land was formally subdivided in 1842 but appears to have been effectively used as three separate lots before that. These lots were developed as follows: *Lot 111 (northern lot) vacant until 1845 when a single storey timber house was built, demolished 1861. *Lot 113 (middle lot) vacant until 1841 when a two-storey brick house was built, demolished 1861. *Lot 115 (southern lot) vacant until 1832 when a two-storey brick house was built, demolished 1862. In 1862, Elizabeth Charles (William's wife) replaced the existing buildings with new three-storey brick walled slate roofed shops and dwellings on all three lots, and they continued to be tenanted by various small business uses. The Charles family retained ownership of the original grant until 1900 when it was resumed by the NSW Government under the Observatory Hill Resumption Act. During 1920 the land granted to William Charles was cleared of buildings, and by the end of that year, two new shop frontages were erected to replace the three previous ones.SCRA 1978: HP/11-13 Little information exists regarding the buildings located on this site between 1862 and the construction of the existing building in the 1920s. Dove's 1880 plan of the area indicates that each lot had a building of roughly similar scale, with a two-storey frontage to George Street and a single storey rear portion. Two bird's eye views show a range of two-storey buildings in this location but it is unknown as to how accurate these portrayals are. No photographs have been located which directly show this site before the construction of the present building. However, an extract from an 1879 photo of the area does show portions of the roofs of the three buildings. This photo indicates that the three buildings were narrow terrace-style buildings. All are two storeys and appear to be constructed in rendered brick. Roofs are steeply pitched and may have been slate. All buildings appear to be identical. By the 1920s, these buildings had been replaced with the current building. The existing building at 111‚Äì115 George Street was constructed in 1920, following the demolition of three commercial buildings which had been on site since 1862. The building originally consisted of a wide, two-storey structure divided into two shopfronts on the ground floor and additional space on the first floor. It appears access to the first floor was via internal staircase(s) and may have been divided into 2 areas, as with the ground floor. The building had a timber veranda over the footpath, suspended from the first storey masonry. The northern half of the building was used throughout the 1970s and early 1980s by a restaurant known as \\"The Rocks Push\\" and \\"The Old Push\\". Photographs from the early 1980s suggest that the rear yard of the building was enclosed by a sandstone wall and used as seating for the restaurant. In 1985 the building was extensively remodelled. This involved the reconstruction of the ground floor shopfronts to provide an arcade style passage through the building with an internal light well, as well as the removal of the original rear skillions, the construction of a new extension connected to the northern ground floor tenancy and the construction of a new external staircase at the rear to access the first floor tenancy. No plans have been located which show the building in its pre-1985 configuration.  Description  Style: Art Nouveau Motifs; Storeys: Two; Facade: Brick walls; Roof Cladding: Iron; Floor Frame: Timber, Tiled Arcade floor, = Condition = As at 27 April 2001, Archaeology Assessment Condition: Partly disturbed. Assessment Basis: Modern building techniques. Underfloor deposits may remain. = Modifications and dates = In 1920 the three existing shops on the site were demolished and two new shops built with residences above. In 1985, an arcade was constructed into the frontage of this property to allow access to Nurses Walk, creating three shops, two facing George Street and one in Nurses Walk. Maximum use was made of the materials from the existing building in carrying out the work. The upper levels were used as the refurbished and renovated Rocks Push Restaurant.  Heritage listing  Captain Tench Arcade and site are of State heritage significance for their historical and scientific cultural values. The site and building are also of State heritage significance for their contribution to The Rocks area which is of State Heritage significance in its own right. Captain Tench Arcade is part of the earliest business street in Australia. It retains its 1920s fa√ßade, and though the shop front was reconfigured in 1985 to provide an arcade through to Nurses Walk, many of the original elements were reused. It is valued by the regional and tourist community as a retail focus in The Rocks and it continues the traditional retail use of the site. Captain Tench Arcade consists of well- scaled buildings which are good examples of their style and type. They provide a positive contribution to the historic George Street retail precinct in The Rocks, and the reconfiguration of the arcade in 1985 was sympathetically carried out and in no way detracts from the streetscape or the architectural feel of the original buildings. The well-designed street facades are good examples of the Federation Style with Art Nouveau Motifs. The site has significant research potential as an archaeological resource, the underfloor deposits appear to remain undisturbed from the demolition of the 1862 buildings. Evidence may still exist which has the potential to inform about previous developments on the site including the 1862 building and even structures erected or land use before this on the site. Captain Tench Arcade was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Captain Tench Arcade and site are of State heritage significance for their historical and scientific cultural values. The site and building are also of State heritage significance for their contribution to The Rocks area which is of State Heritage significance in its own right. Captain Tench Arcade is part of the earliest business street in Australia and the continuing use of the buildings as shops continues this tradition. This land was part of the first hospital complex serving the early colony. The second brick ward/store was erected on this site. It has historic and social significance by the strong associations with the early grants and subsequent developments on this site and within The Rocks generally. The building provides evidence of endeavours to encourage planned development after The Rocks had been resumed by the Government in the early 20th century. This site is important as a State significant example of the 20th century use of The Rocks as a commercial precinct. The building continues the pattern of use on this site which was established in the 1830s and contributes to the surrounding commercial precinct. The construction of this building in 1920 by the NSW Government after the resumption of The Rocks and its reconstruction in 1985 are indicative of the Government's commitment to enhance The Rocks as an important commercial and recreational precinct. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. This site does not meet the threshold for this criterion. While the site has been named after Captain Watkin Tench, an important figure in early colonial history, this name was not applied to the site until 1985 to commemorate his historic importance however there are no known historical associations between Tench and this site. This site has no other known historical associations with any particular individuals of note. The site is associated with the first hospital complex and gardens which stood here from 1788 to 1815. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Captain Tench arcade are well-scaled buildings and good examples of their style and type. They provide a positive contribution to the historic George St retail precinct in The Rocks. The reconfiguration of the arcade in 1985 was sympathetically carried out and in no way detracts form the streetscape or the architectural feel of the original buildings. The well-designed street facades are good examples of the Federation Style with Art Nouveau Motifs. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Captain Tench Arcade has historic and social significance by the strong associations with early land grants and the subsequent developments on the site and in The Rocks generally. It is valued by the regional and tourist community as a retail focus in The Rocks and it continues the traditional retail use of the site. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The site has significant research potential as an archaeological resource, the underfloor deposits appear to remain undisturbed from the demolition of the 1862 buildings. Evidence may still exist which has the potential to inform about previous developments on the site including the 1862 building and even structures erected or land use before this on the site. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. This building is an uncommon example of a 1920s building in a precinct which is largely 19th century in character. It meets this criterion at a local level. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The place is not considered to meet this criterion as it is typical of small scale commercial buildings constructed throughout Sydney in the 1920s, however it is unusual within the context of The Rocks.

Biography  Matteucci was born in Turin. His father, a worker with a criminal record for theft and receiving stolen goods, abandoned the family the year his son was born. His mother, Maria Pandiscia, left Andrea in custody of her sister Lina, in Foggia. At the age of 5, he moved with his mother to Aosta, in a religious institute where he lived until he was 9 years old. When questioned about his mother, Andrea said: \\"She was a prostitute and she let me attend meetings with her clients. I hate women who get paid to be with men.\\" At age 14, he tried to rob the butcher's shop where he worked at, but a week later he confessed to the act. From 14 to 18 he remained in the community, subsequently leaving to work as a mechanic in Quart.  Murders  The Roman Theatre of Aosta, site of the 30 April 1980 murder On the evening of 30 April 1980, when he left home, Matteucci met the merchant Domenico Raso at the Roman Theatre of Aosta. The man, secretly a homosexual, made sexual advances and to defend himself, Matteucci killed him with a boy scout's knife. Raso had a family, and this led Andrea to believe that he had done the right thing because \\"a man can not do certain things\\": his mental state was altered, believing that those who have family and engage in extramarital sexual acts do not deserve to live. Matteucci was not discovered by the investigators and a few months after the crime he left for military service, during which he asked to enter the Folgore in Livorno. He left in 1983, with the rank of major corporal. In the same year, he got married and settled in Villeneuve, where he found a job as a shop assistant in a grocery store. In 1987, he had his first child and started working as a stonemason, first under various firms and then in his own workshop in Arvier. Meanwhile, his relationship with his wife began to deteriorate. One evening in 1992, Matteucci met Turin prostitute Daniela Zago in Brissogne. The two had a quarrel while having sex, resulting in Andrea shooting her in the head. Zago did not die immediately and asked Matteucci to take her to the hospital; he pretended to accept her plea, before taking her to an isolated location where he shot her in the head again, killing her. He then buried the corpse not far from the crime scene, in Arvier. After a month, fearing that the remains can be discovered, he dug them up and burned them at a landfill. Villeneuve and the bridge over the Dora Baltea from which the ashes of prostitute Clara Omoregbee were thrown In 1994, he met the Nigerian prostitute Clara Omoregbee in Chambave, engaging in sexual intercourse with her near Arnad. Not satisfied with the performance, Matteucci argued with her, hit the woman with his fists and killed her by shooting her twice, once in the head. After this, he had sex with her corpse. Back home, he dissected the corpse with a kitchen knife, after having burnt the remains in Arvier, throwing them into the Dora Baltea river near Villeneuve. On 10 September 1994, while searching for victims in Nus, Matteucci met prostitute Lucy Omon and took her home. After having sex with her, he promised to take her back to Nus by car; instead he took her to Arvier, to his old stonemason's workshop, where he tried to suffocate her with a pillow and a rag. Omon managed to escape from the car. In 1995, he was convicted of car theft. Taking advantage of the benefit that he was not incarcerated, but it was imposed on him that he had an obligation to sign in Saint-Pierre and being forbidden to move outside of the perimeter between Arvier and Aosta. On 12 May 1995 he killed Albanian prostitute Albana Dakovi. After having sexual intercourse with her, Matteucci took her to Arnad, where he killed her by hitting her with a wrench and then stabbing her. He then hid the body in his van, with which he then went to Saint-Pierre to sign the register. Like the previous victims, Dakovi's remains were burned.  Arrest and conviction  Dakovi's pimp sent an anonymous letter to the Pont-Saint- Martin barracks where he claimed to have seen the girl enter into an Iveco Daily van, also writing down the license plate number. On 26 June 1995 Matteucci was arrested in connection with the disappearance, but denied killing Dakovi. The next day, when he was questioned again, he admitted to killing her, immediately confessing to the other murders as well. During the trial, the psychiatric examination to which he was subjected declared Matteucci \\"socially dangerous\\" and partially incapable of understanding and wanting. On 16 April 1996 he was sentenced to 28 years imprisonment and 3 years in a judicial psychiatric hospital by the Court of Assizes of Aosta. He left prison in March 2017 at the age of 55, entering a psychiatric health facility.

The Second Ancient Theatre of Larissa () is an ancient Greek theatre in the city of Larissa in Thessaly, Greece. History The theatre was built in the second half of the 1st century BC, on the southwestern slopes of the Pefkakia hill. Its construction is probably connected to the conversion of the city's original theatre which was converted into an arena for gladiatorial contests and public spectacles after the Roman conquest of Greece. The excavator of the site, Athanasios Tziafalias, suggested in particular a connection with the festival of \\"Eleutheria\\", which featured athletic and horsemanship contests as well as theatrical, musical, and poetry performances. An inscription dedicated to Demeter and the Kore indicates that the site also housed a temple dedicated to them (thesmophorion). The theatre was left in ruins in the Middle Ages, when a Byzantine church dedicated to the Holy Wisdom or to Saint Paraskevi was erected in its place. The church was in turn replaced by the mosque of Hasan Bey was erected on the site during the Ottoman period. The Pefkakia hill was levelled in the 1950s to provide space for housing construction. The theatre was rediscovered in 1978, during digging for the construction of a new apartment building complex. The site was excavated in 1985‚Äì1986. The theatre has been occasionally used for theatrical performances since. Description Only the stage (skene) and the chorus area (orchestra) were completed; the semi-circular seating area (koilon) and the side entrances (parodoi) were left incomplete, apparently due to inability to fund their completion. The koilon is divided by 14 stairs into thirteen tiers, each with two rows of low seats of grey-white marble (edolia); the rest were never completed, and probably wooden seats (ikria) were used instead. The orchestra has a diameter of and is composed of two layers of stamped earth mixed with gravel. The thymele (a small square altar) is located on its right. It is of white marble, decorated with Lesbian-style kymatia (decorative bands). It stood on a stepped pedestal of three steps, of which the two lower ones survive. The marble used in the theatre was not newly quarried, but reused from an older building, probably of circular shape. Some of the blocks feature inscriptions from freedmen dating to the late 3rd century BC.

Erbe (born 1944) is an American oil painter. He is self-taught, and he is best known for his trompe l'oeils. His work has been exhibited at the Canton Museum of Art, the Brinton Museum, the Boca Raton Museum of Art, the Heckscher Museum of Art, the Baum School of Art and the Reading Public Museum. Background Erbe‚Äôs interest in art began at a young age when he became fascinated by the illustrations in his school textbooks. Erbe‚Äôs stepfather, Frank Schaefer, encouraged and supported Erbe‚Äôs interest in art and bought him his first art set. When Erbe was fifteen, his stepfather died and, in the following decade, Erbe produced very little art.Christine I. Oaklander, Ph.D., in Footprints: The Art and Life of Gary Erbe, Youngstown, Ohio: The Butler Institute of American Art, 2016, p.10 At age sixteen, Erbe dropped out of school, and moved into a studio apartment in Weehawken, New Jersey. Shortly after, Erbe met Edny, whom he would marry in 1963. One year later, Edny and Erbe had their first child, Kim, and five years later had their second child, Chantell. To support his family, Erbe worked as an apprentice at an engraving company and painted in his spare time.Christine I. Oaklander, Ph.D., in Footprints: The Art and Life of Gary Erbe, Youngstown, Ohio: The Butler Institute of American Art, 2016, p. 12 Erbe was particularly inspired by artists like William Michael Harnett and John F. Peto, who applied the trompe l'oeil approach to their paintings. Trompe l'oeil translates to ‚Äúfool the eye,‚Äù alluding to the way in which three-dimensional objects are rendered on a two dimensional surface. His work from the sixties involves assemblages of objects which have a thematic relationship with each other. Both the paintings and the assemblages which he paints are Erbe's masterpieces, and the assemblages have been included in his shows.Christine I. Oaklander, Ph.D., in Footprints: The Art and Life of Gary Erbe, Youngstown, Ohio: The Butler Institute of American Art, 2016, pp. 14-15 In 1969, Erbe explored a more contemporary method to trompe l‚Äôoeil called Levitational Realism, in which the objects in his paintings appear to be floating. In the following year, he quit his job as an engraver in hopes of becoming a full-time artist. In 1978, Erbe and Edny split and Erbe moved into his own studio in Union City. Through a mutual friend he met Anna Vedovelli, a local artist who lived nearby. The two married in 1979 but divorced three years later.Christine I. Oaklander, Ph.D., in Footprints: The Art and Life of Gary Erbe, Youngstown, Ohio: The Butler Institute of American Art, 2016, pp. 15-22 By 1996, Erbe was married to Zeny Santos. They lived in his studio in Union City until 2006, moved to a condominium in Hoboken, New Jersey for three years, and now reside in Nutley, New Jersey.Christine I. Oaklander, Ph.D., in Footprints: The Art and Life of Gary Erbe, Youngstown, Ohio: The Butler Institute of American Art, 2016, p. 22-23. Since 1970, Erbe‚Äôs work has been exhibited extensively in group and solo exhibitions. His work is in the permanent collections of various well- regarded institutions.Christine I.

He started his career as an apprentice at the Norfolk Broads Yachting Company upon leaving school in 1907. The company was then managed by his father, Walter Woods. Following the outbreak of World War I, Woods was spared from active service as a result of a chronic neck problem. During this time, he worked in aerodynamics at agricultural machinery maker Ransomes, Sims & Jefferies, based in Ipswich, Suffolk. Woods returned to Norfolk in 1922, after the Norfolk Broads Yachting Company had gone into liquidation. His father, Walter, purchased the premises and enlisted the help of Herbert and his brother to build the family company, Walter Woods & Sons. Boat building In 1926, Woods designed and built a Broads motor cruiser titled the ‚ÄòSpeed of Light‚Äô. The vessel was smaller than existing models, coming in at 34-foot. She would draw in less water than older models and was the first in the fleet to encompass a freshwater tank, supplying the on-board toilet and taps. Herbert Woods took over the company in 1929, naming it the Herbert Woods Boatyard.

It covers the surrounding of the centrally placed subprefecture Nontron. Jules Verne had called the Nontronnais P√©rigord vert (Green P√©rigord) referring to the region's lush vegetation. The term P√©rigord vert is used mainly in tourism, but is not identical with the Nontronnais, which covers a much smaller area. Geography The Nontronnais is situated in the far north of the Dordogne. Administratively it is composed of the Communaut√© de communes du P√©rigord vert nontronnais and the Communaut√© de communes du Haut-P√©rigord, which have fused by now to become the Communaut√© de communes du P√©rigord Nontronnais. It contains 28 communes and was inhabited in 2014 by 15,567 people. The surface area of the Nontronnais is 560.25 square kilometres resulting in a population density of 28 inhabitants per square kilometre ‚Äî a rather low figure. Some authors restrict the Nontronnais only to the Communaut√© de communes du P√©rigord vert nontronnais with its 17 communes. The Nontronnais is surrounded by the following natural regions: in the north by the Pays de la Vienne in the Haute-Vienne d√©partement, in the east by the Pays d'Uzerche and by the Pays de Brive in the Corr√®ze d√©partement, in the south by the P√©rigord central and by the Rib√©racois in the Dordogne d√©partement and in the west by the Pays d'Horte et Tardoire in the Charente d√©partement. Attributed to the Nontronnais can be four more territories: * the surroundings of Bussi√®re-Badil * the surroundings of Thiviers * the surroundings of Jumilhac-le-Grand * the surroundings of Lanouaille. The four touristic regions of the P√©rigord Topographically the Nontronnais covers the northwestern fringe of the French Massif Central and this explains why it is sometimes referred to as P√©rigord limousin. Its relief is taken up by undulating plateaus varying in elevation between 200 and 370 meters. These plateaus dip slightly to the southwest and have been incised by the rivers Auv√©z√®re, Bandiat, Isle, and Loue, the canyons being covered by abundant vegetation. The local climate is under the influence of the Atlantic Ocean with about a 1000 millimetres in yearly precipitation. This rather damp climate causes a very lush vegetation governed by chestnut, oak, spruce, Scots Pine, ferns, heath, gorse and reeds. . The touristic term P√©rigord vert has got a wider definition as it includes besides the Nontronnais also a small part of the northern P√©rigord central and the Rib√©racois, which belong to the P√©rigord blanc. The latter two territories are underlain by Mesozoic limestones and therefore completely differ geologically from the Nontronnais dominated by Variscan basement rocks.  Geology  Plagioclase-rich paragneiss from Nontron The Nontronnais is traversed from southeast to northwest by a very important geological boundary separating basement rocks in the northeast from flat lying sediments of the Aquitaine Basin in the southwest. This boundary is usually marked by an important fault. The crystalline basement rocks consist of high-grade paragneisses in sillimanite facies and granitoids like the Pi√©gut-Pluviers Granodiorite and the Saint- Mathieu Leucogranite. The sediments of the Aquitaine Basin harbour arkoses, dolomites, shales and various limestones. The border fault starts near Saint- Pardoux-la-Rivi√®re, passes near the lower town of Nontron and continues towards Saint-Martin-le-Pin. The fault is mineralized and was mined for lead, zinc and minor silver. As the mining activities aren't economically viable anymore they stopped. History Abbey Notre-Dame-de-la-Nativit√© in Bussi√®re- Badil Up to the French Revolution only a few communes in the north of the actual Dordogne d√©partement belonged to the P√©rigord. The parishes of the Archpriest of Nontron were in fact dependent on the Roman Catholic Diocese of Limoges. The vast majority of these parishes was integrated in 1790 into the newly created Dordogne d√©partement. Amongst those parishes were Ajat (now Abjat-sur-Bandiat), Augignac, Busseroles (now Busserolles), Champniers et Reillac (since 1847 Champniers-et-Reilhac), La Chapelle-Montmoreau, Connezac, Javerlhac, Saint-Robert (since 1823 Javerlhac-et-la-Chapelle-Saint-Robert), Millac (now Milhac-de-Nontron), Nontron, Nontronneau (now Lussas-et- Nontronneau), Pluviers (now Pi√©gut-Pluviers), Quinsac, Romain (now Champs- Romain), Saint-Angel (now Sceau-Saint-Angel), Saint-Barth√©lemy (now Saint- Barth√©lemy-de-Bussi√®re), Saint-Etienne (now Saint-Est√®phe), Saint-Front-de-la- Rivi√®re (now Saint-Front-la-Rivi√®re), Saint-Martial (now Saint-Martial-de- Valette), Saint-Martin-le-Peint (now Saint-Martin-le-Pin), Saint-Pardoux (now Saint-Pardoux-la-Rivi√®re), Saint-Saud (now Saint-Saud-Lacoussi√®re), Teyjac (now Teyjat) and Varaigne (now Varaignes).

Cheney, he spent years studying the social behavior, communication, and cognition of wild primates in their natural habitat, including more than a decade of field work with baboons in the Okavango Delta of Botswana. Seyfarth, a professor of psychology at the University of Pennsylvania until his retirement, is a member of both the United States National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Background and career Robert M. Seyfarth was born on February 16, 1948. He grew up in Chicago, but enjoyed fishing trips with his father to Canada and the Caribbean. During his senior year at Phillips Exeter Academy, he became interested in science after taking a course on Darwin. In 1970, he graduated from the honors program in Biological Anthropology at Harvard College. Fascinated by wild primates, Seyfarth then applied to work at Cambridge University with Robert Hinde, who had been the thesis advisor of Jane Goodall. Having been accepted by Hinde, Seyfarth then spent two years (1972‚Äì1974) in the field studying baboons in Mountain Zebra National Park in South Africa, together with Dorothy Cheney, whom he had recently married. In 1976, Seyfarth received a doctorate from Cambridge. After a four-year postdoc at Rockefeller University, and another four years at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) as assistant professors, Seyfarth and Cheney moved to the University of Pennsylvania in 1985, where Seyfarth joined the Psychology Department. Research Vervet monkey (Kenya)Seyfarth's research and publications were largely based on longterm field studies of primates in the natural habitat, usually in partnership with Cheney. From 1977 to 1988, Seyfarth and Cheney studied the behavior and ecology of vervet monkeys, in Kenya's Amboseli National Park. This research was summarized in their book How Monkeys See the World (1990). They showed that the alarm calls of vervet monkeys have specific semantic content, so that playing back a recording of one type of call makes monkeys look up in the sky for eagles, while playing back a different call makes monkeys scan the bushes for a snake. According to the Newsletter of the Animal Behavior Society, \\"These results were the first strong evidence that non-human vertebrates use signals to refer to things external to themselves, and as such revolutionized our understanding of the cognitive side of animal communication.\\" Female Chacma baboon (Papio ursinus griseipes) with infant (Botswana)From 1992 to 2008, Seyfarth and Cheney studied vocal communication and social structure of chacma baboons, at the Moremi Game Reserve in Botswana. This research was summarized in their book Baboon Metaphysics (2007). Seyfarth and Cheney studied baboon vocalizations, social relationships, and social cognition, with a particular interest in factors that contribute to baboon fitness. Their research showed that baboons are acutely aware of hierarchies and relationships in the group they belong to. Baboon mothers who build good relationships with other adults greatly increase the chance of their offspring's survival. According to Seyfarth, the rules for successful baboons are, \\"like [those] in a Jane Austen novel, be nice to your relatives and get in with the high-ranking relatives\\". The Animal Behavior Society has described Seyfarth and Cheney as \\"pre-eminent leaders not just in primate communication but in the field of animal communication as a whole.\\" Honors Seyfarth was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2012 and to the National Academy of Science in 2017. The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences awarded its 2010 Cozzarelli Prize, for the best article in the area of Behavioral and Social Sciences, to a paper about baboon collaboration coauthored by Cheney and Seyfarth.

The oldest part, a Scottish vernacular L-plan tower house, dates from the early 17th century. From 1660 it was owned by the Gilmour family, who arranged for additions and extensions to the house in the 18th and 19th centuries. It was sold to the then Edinburgh Corporation in 1945. Since then it has been used as a primary school and more recently as a community centre.  Origins and ownership  The word ‚ÄòInch‚Äô derives from the Scots Gaelic ‚Äòinnis‚Äô which can mean either 'island' or a dry area within marshland or a river meadow. This suggests that the land on which it stands was originally dry land in the flood plain of the nearby Braid Burn. The lands of Nether Liberton on which Inch House now stands were granted to the monks of Holyrood Abbey from the mid-15th century. The lands then came into the possession of Alexander Forrester, 6th of Corstorphine, confirmed by King James V in the lands and Barony of Corstorphine, which at that time included Nether Liberton. It is possible that this family built an early tower on the site. The present house was originally built as an L- shaped tower house in the Scottish vernacular style consisting of three floors and an attic. There have been additions at different times in its history. The original house was built for James Winram (d.1632), Keeper of the Great Seal of Scotland who passed it to his son George Winram (Lord Liberton). A supporter of the Covenanters, he died in 1650 from wounds sustained at the Battle of Dunbar where he fought against Oliver Cromwell's army. After the battle the victorious Cromwell took over Inch House. In 1660 the property was bought by Sir John Gilmour of Craigmillar, Lord President of the Court of Session, and it remained in the hands of the Gilmour family until 1945. The last residents were Sir Robert Gordon Gilmour and his wife Lady Susan Gilmour (n√©e Lygon) (1870 ‚Äì 1962). Their son, Sir John Little Gilmour (1899-1977) sold the estate and the house to the then City of Edinburgh Council in 1946. It was then used as a primary school with some of the children moving to the newly built Liberton Primary School in 1956. The remaining pupils were those of St John Vianney Roman Catholic Primary School, and these pupils finally moved to a new school in 1968. The house subsequently became a community centre. Sir John Gilmour bought Inch House in 1660. Inch House, south-west facade. The west wing, modified in 1890-92, is on the right.  17th century  In 1607 James Winram (father of George Winram, Lord Liberton) bought the Nether Liberton lands which included the Inch estate. He commissioned the building of Inch House which was originally an L shaped tower, completed in 1617. The doorway with the date 1617 embossed on the lintel is still present, but due to later alterations, is now entirely internal. New features were added in 1634. A large doorway was built in the internal angle of the ‚ÄòL‚Äô to form a grand entrance leading to a wide spiral staircase. Also in 1634 a two-storey north- east wing was added to the tower.  18th and 19th centuries  Western approach driveway to Inch House Sir John Gilmour of Craigmillar had also bought Craigmillar Castle which he made his home while renting out Inch House. His successors, the Gilmour baronets of Craigmillar, did the same. During the Jacobite rising of 1745 Government forces were stationed in Inch House. A west wing was added late in the 18th century. After the death of Sir Alexander Gilmour, 3rd Baronet in 1792, the house was modernised, and the Gilmour family lived there from 1796. Further modifications took place in 1813 and in 1834, including moving the main entrance to the south side of the building. Sir Robert Gordon Gilmour (1857-1939) inherited the house and in 1889 married Lady Susan Lygon (1870-1962), and they planned a major series of internal and external alterations which took place between 1890 and 1892. They commissioned the leading historical architectural firm MacGibbon and Ross, who had published a major historical survey of Scotland's towers and stately homes entitled The Castellated and Domestic Architecture of Scotland from the twelfth to the eighteenth centuries, They were asked by the Gordon Gilmours to make the entrance to the house grander and more impressive and to make the house more comfortable for late 19th century living. MacGibbon and Ross achieved this while retaining much of the earlier historic character of the building. The modernisation and embellishment included enhancing the main entrance by creating an elaborate pilastered and pedimented porch, above which is inscribed the Gilmour family motto ‚ÄòNil Penna Sed Usus‚Äô ('the practice not the penmanship'). This doorway led to a grand entrance hallway and staircase. A fire destroyed this staircase in 1979, and it was replaced with one in a similar style. There were also external and internal modifications made to the 18th century west wing. The internal modifications included enlarging ground floor and first floor rooms by removing internal walls, enlarging windows, creating west-facing bay windows and stripping the plasterwork in the ground floor room of the tower to make the original stonework a feature. Externally the west wing was made to look grander with the addition of angle turrets and dormer windows. There was further major expansion of the building at this time with the addition of a north wing which resulted in the formation of an inner courtyard. The 1890 modifications also included building a chimney on the original tower building to vent a very large fireplace created in the ground floor.  20th century  Inch House was bought in 1946 by the then Edinburgh Corporation. It was used as a primary school, and the courtyard was roofed over to form a dining room. Some pupils transferred in 1956 to the nearby purpose built Liberton Primary School. The remaining primary school, St John Vianney Roman Catholic Primary school, was transferred to a newly built school of the same name in nearby Ivanhoe Crescent in 1968. The building has since been a community centre. A brutalist-style fire escape was added to the wall of the west wing, ruining the west facade around 1970. The Inch Community Centre uses many of the rooms in the house including general purpose rooms, music rehearsal rooms, areas for arts and crafts, a photography room, a kitchen and an office. The centre runs a variety of activities, classes and clubs. Plan of Inch House showing original tower house and subsequent additions  Description  Inch House is located in the south of Edinburgh, two miles south east of the city centre. The district is now known as The Inch and contains Inch Park and the Inch housing development. Access from the west is by a roadway off Gilmerton Road, through the original west gate of the property. Access from the east is from Old Dalkeith Road by a roadway which skirts the northern boundary of the City of Edinburgh Council's Inch plant nursery and horticultural training centre, formerly the walled garden of Inch House. Originally a tower house, several major additions have been made to the building over the centuries. = The Seventeenth century tower house = The original L-shaped tower dates from 1617. The wide staircase added at the re- entrant angle of the tower in 1634 was an unusual feature in towers of this period. The large doorway, created on the north side of the tower at the same time, is now internal as a result of later additions. The lintel carries the date 1617, the motto \\"Blessed be God\\" above the initials James Winram (IW) and his wife Jean Swinton (JS). The ground floor room, originally a vault or cellar, occupies the entire breadth of the tower. It has a barrel vaulted ceiling, and the original stonework is now revealed as a feature. There are smaller rooms on the second and third floors from where a turret stair leads to a roof area which commands panoramic views. = The north east wing = This three storey extension, added in 1634, connects the tower block to the north wing. On the west external wall above two windows are the initials 'IW' and 'IS' again representing James Winram and Jean Swinton. The date 1634 is inscribed on one of the dormers. = The west wing = The two storey west wing was built in the 1790s and was modified internally and externally in 1891-92. The large room on the ground floor is of a similar size to the equivalent room in the tower house, while the first floor also has a large room of similar size along the length of the wing. Both these rooms have large bay windows added in 1892. Third floor rooms are smaller and feature dormer windows added in 1891-92. = The north wing = Added in 1892 this wing consists of smaller rooms used in the past as residential quarters for staff and later for school staff.

Biography Adolf Friedrich Leschnitzer was born in Posen (as Pozna≈Ñ was known before 1945). He was born into a Jewish merchant family of Polish provenance. Oscar Leschnitzer (1864‚Äì1934), his father, was a pharmacist who moved with his family to Berlin in 1910. Adolf attended the Frederick William Gymnasium (secondary school) in Posen and, then, after the family moved, the Empress Augusta Gymnasium (secondary school) in Berlin- Charlottenburg. He graduated from the school \\"cum laude\\" in 1917. However, the war was raging, and he was now conscripted into the army, serving till 1918. Between 1918 and 1923 he studied Germanistics, History, Philosophy and Pedagogy at Berlin and Heidelberg. It was from Heidelberg University that in 1923 he received his doctorate, with a dissertation on Medieval love songs (\\"Untersuchungen √ºber das Hohelied in Minneliedern\\"). In or before 1926 he passed Levels I and II of the National professional exams for work in teaching. He had by then embarked on a career as a secondary school teacher of German and History in Berlin. He qualified as a \\"student assessor\\" (examiner) in 1927. Leschnitzer gained further promotions as he taught at a succession of Berlin secondary schools till 1933. During this period he was also involved in teacher training acted as a consultant in respect of the teaching of German literary history. After several years during which politics had become ever more polarised and parliament gridlocked, the National Socialists took power in January 1933 and lost little time in transforming Germany into a one-party dictatorship. Public antisemitism, till now chiefly apparent through a succession of populist political slogans, now became a key underpinning of government policy. The so-called Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service (\\"Gesetz zur Wiederherstellung des Berufsbeamtentums\\") passed in April 1933 provided expressly for the immediate dismissal of \\"non-Aryans\\" from a wide range of public-sector jobs. Adolf Leschnitzer was dismissed from his Berlin teaching post during 1933. That same year he accepted an invitation from Leo Baeck, president of the \\"Reichsvertretung der Deutschen Juden\\" (loosely, \\"National representation of German Jews\\"), to work as an organiser of Jewish education. He was given charge of the schools department.Joseph Walk: J√ºdische Schule und Erziehung im Dritten Reich, 1991, pp. 117, 137 This meant he was responsible for the education of approximately 38,000 school children in 130 schools. Critical decisions in respect of languages and education had to be addressed in the teaching schedules. He also found himself at the centre of heated debates on religious instruction, arbitrating between Liberal and Orthodox priorities. Between 1934 and November 1938 Leschnitzer published 29 text booklets for the Jewish schools. He himself authored booklet 10: \\"Das Judentum im Weltbild des Mittelalters\\" (\\"Judaism in the late medieval context\\"), published in 1935. In 1939 Leschnitzer emigrated with his wife, the literature scholar Maria Bratz, and their baby son. They travelled via the Netherlands to their initial destination, which was England, where according to one source Leschnitzer supported himself undertaking library work in Cambridge. They moved on in 1940 to the United States where Leschnitzer immediately set about creating and organising the \\"American Institute of Modern Languages\\" in New York. From 1940 till 1952, with backing vfrom the \\"New World Club\\", he directed what was in effect a private language school for newly arrived immigrants, most of whom were refugees, often from political and/or race-based persecution in Germany and central Europe more generally. Alongside this work, in 1943 he took a teaching position just outside New York City on its southside at Rutgers University‚ÄìNew Brunswick. The United States had entered the war in support of Great Britain and the Soviet Union at the end of 1941. Leschnitzer taught foreign languages, which involved work for the German Section of the Foreign Area and Language Curriculum of the Army Specialized Training Program. He combined the teaching with work as a consultant to the US United States Department of War and to the United States Office of War Information. The war in Europe ended in May 1945. The western two thirds of Germany were now divided into four military occupation zones, with the United States taking on control of most of the southern part of the country. 1945 was also the year in which Leschnitzer authored a memorandum entitled \\"An Immediate Program for the Reconstruction of the German School System\\". He was keen that the next generation of Germans should have a closer understanding of the interplay of German history with Jewish history and culture, as a way to bring \\"the two peoples together\\". In 1946 he took a job as a languages teacher at the City College of New York where he continued to work till his retirement in 1966. Initially he was employed as Professor of Germanistics. In 1958 he took over as head of the department for German and Slavonic Languages. He was a member of various professional associations, serving as president of the \\"New York Society of Teachers of German\\" between 1957 and 1964. In 1955 he joined the executive board (\\"Vorstand\\") at the Leo Baeck Institute in New York, of which he had been a founding member. Starting in 1952 he also taught a succession of summer courses as a guest professor at the US-sponsored Free University of (West) Berlin (FU). Between 1955 and 1972 he combined his responsibilities in New York with an active role as Honorary Professor for the History and Culture of Judaism at the FU's \\"Institute for Jewish Studies\\" (\\"Institut f√ºr Judaistik\\"). The Shoah was still a recent trauma for millions of survivors, and during the 1950s only very few Jews, of whom Adolf Leschnitzer was one, felt able and willing to work regularly - albeit not permanently - in Berlin. Publications (selection) Adolf Leschnitzer also published written contributions to magazines and journals on topics that included German-Jewish history, Anti-Semitism, Heinrich Heine (and other German-Jewish writers) and Goethe. Over the years he also produced one or two more substantial works: Awards and honours (selection)Personal Leschnitzer married Dr. Maria E. Bratz (1909-2005) in 1937. Their son Michael Leschnitzer (later known as Michael Lesch), who became a lawyer, was born in Berlin in 1938.

She featured in the \\"Black Classicists\\" travelling exhibition celebrating the achievements of African Americans working in Classical education.  Early life  Frazelia Campbell was born in Charleston, South Carolina on 18 March 1849 to Frederick and Julia Swartz Campbell.  Education  Campbell studied at Philadelphia's Institute for Colored Youth, graduating in 1867. She was probably taught by Fanny Jackson Coppin, a graduate of Oberlin College and a campaigner for women's education who taught Greek, Latin, and Mathematics at the Institute from 1865 and served as its Principal from 1869-1902. Campbell gave a paper titled \\"The Worth of Books\\" on the school's 1865 commencement program, and another in 1866 called \\"Sic Itur ad Astra.\\" Two years later, in 1868, she presented her essay \\"Virgil and Grey\\" at the school's winter commencement.  Career  After graduation she worked at the Institute, teaching Latin, German, and Spanish, becoming the Principal of the Girls' High School at the Institute in 1876. When the Institute discontinued its academic work in 1902, Campbell moved to a teaching post at Allen University in Columbia, South Carolina, a university founded to support the education of African American people. During her time at the Institute for Colored Youth and at Allen University, she published articles on a range of classical and educational topics in the African Methodist Episcopal Church Review. Campbell taught at Allen University until at least 1912; at some point after this she returned to Philadelphia.  Death  Campbell remained in Philadelphia where she died in her home, 621 N.

Originally set up as al-Barakah Province () to govern ISIL territories in al-Hasakah Governorate, the province shifted south after 2016 due to the territorial losses to the YPG/YPJ. Having been demoted from province to district in 2018, al-Barakah administered a small strip of land along the Euphrates in Deir ez-Zor Governorate until the Battle of Baghuz Fawqani.  History  Seal of al-Barakah during its time as self-proclaimed province After entering the Syrian Civil War in 2013, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant started to call al-Hasakah Governorate \\"al-Barakah\\" (translated \\"the blessing\\" or \\"the blessed\\"). Having captured vast swaths of Iraq and Syria, ISIL reorganized itself as proto-state in 2013/14, creating a government and 18 provinces (\\"wilayah\\") under the authority of the \\"Provincial Council\\" to administer its territories. Al-Barakah Province was founded in early 2014 to govern ISIL-held areas in al-Hasakah Governorate, and essentially claimed the same boundaries as the latter. In a number of battles in course of 2014, most notably the Battle of Markada, ISIL defeated other rebel factions in the governorate and integrated their territories into al- Barakah Province. The province was further expanded during the 2014 Eastern Syria offensive. Nevertheless, the province's actual control remained limited to al-Hasakah Governorate's west and south, while the rest was held by YPG/YPJ and the Syrian Army. After already losing much of its territory in 2015 to a number of YPG-led offensives, al-Barakah was reduced to al-Hasakah Governorate's frontier areas during the al-Shaddadi offensive of early 2016. Much of al-Barakah's regional leadership was also killed by an American airstrike in the latter offensive. By late 2017, al-Barakah consisted just of a few villages and oil wells in al-Hasakah Governorate's east; in response, the ISIL central command transferred some areas which previously belonged to \\"al-Furat [Euphrates] Province\\" to al-Barakah. Around November of that year, the leadership of al-Barakah Province agreed to a month-long ceasefire with the YPG-led Syrian Democratic Forces. On 19 April 2018, much of al-Barakah's leadership, including its governor, general Sharia official, and 30 battalion and sector commanders, were killed by a bombing during a meeting. ISIL reorganized its regional affiliates in Iraq and Syria in July 2018, reducing former provinces like al-Barakah to districts and instead referring to all of Syria as a single province. After the launch of a SDF campaign to evict ISIL from its last Syrian strongholds east of the Euphrates in September 2018, ISIL further reorganized its territorial divisions. Al-Barakah was moved south, into areas that were previously administrated by al-Furat Province. This move was probably due to ISIL losing all remaining territory in al-Hasakah Governorate during the early stages of the campaign. At the same time, a new \\"al-Hasakah\\" branch was set up in the areas which had originally been part of al-Barakah Province, probably to coordinate terrorist attacks there. The territory of al-Barakah district came under increasing pressure during 2018, as the SDF advanced along the Euphrates. By late 2018, al-Barakah's territory witnessed heavy fighting, and al-Baghuz Fawqani, a village under al-Barakah's jurisdiction, became ISIL's last important territorial holding in Syria by February 2019. As the SDF and ISIL battled for Baghuz Fawqani, al-Barakah's media channel released a video declaring that defeat in this battle would not mean defeat in the entire campaign, and urged the ISIL loyalists to continue their resistance. Even as their last pocket in al-Baghuz was reduced to a small tent city and a cave system, ISIL continued to keep its institutions functioning, including its bureaucracy, police, and distribution of food and monetary aid to civilian followers. Even though al-Barakah ceased to exist as coherent territorial entity following the Battle of Baghuz Fawqani, its forces remained active. Militants affiliated with al-Barakah pledged allegiance to ISIL's new caliph Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurashi on 9 November 2019, and reportedly attacked a U.S. base in al-Shaddadah on 26 December.  Organization = Territory = Al-Barakah Province generally claimed all of al-Hasakah Governorate as its territory, though it never fully controlled the region. By early 2016, al-Barakah Province's headquarters was al-Shaddadah, while the province had been reduced to southern al-Hasakah Governorate. Following its demotion to district and move south, the administrative division covered Hajin and the villages of al-Baghuz Fawqani, al-Sayyal and Hasrat (which ISIL calls al-Khayrat) and Mawzan near the Euphrates, all of them part of the Abu Kamal District. Furthermore, the village of al-Bahra near Hajin was already part of al-Barakah since late 2017. Al-Barakah district in its current form is bordered by al-Furat district to its west and al-Khayr district to its northwest. = Leadership = The province's first governor (\\"wali\\") was Abu Osama al-Iraqi who held the position from 2014 to 2015, when he was killed during the Battle of al-Hasakah city by an American airstrike. He had been a member of ISIL's senior leadership, and was considered to be one of the group's \\"military elite leaders\\". At some point, Abu al-Waleed al-Sinawi was appointed wali of al-Barakah. He was killed on 19 April 2018. Another prominent member of al-Barakah's government was the Saudi female jihadist Rima al-Jarish, a co-founder of the al-Khansaa Brigade who \\"led the media machine\\" of al-Barakah from 2014 until her death in 2016 and was responsible for recruiting foreigners. Adam al-Chechani (d. 2016) served as leading military commander in the province by 2016. Two known general Sharia officials for al- Barakah include Sheikh Abu Raghad al-Da'jani, and Abu Raghad al-Da'jani (died 19 April 2018). Furthermore, several sub-commanders and regional leaders of al-Barakah are known: *Abu Abeer al-Iraqi, \\"deputy emir\\" of al-Shaddadah until his death in 2016 *Abu Aicha al-Jazrawi, head of the Sharia Court in al- Shaddadah from an unknown point after May 2015 until his death in 2016 * Abu Hamid, emir for tribal affairs and head of the Sharia Court until his death in 2015 *Awn al-Murad al-Tunisi (\\"Abu Sayyaf al-Tunisi\\"), head of the Diwan al- Rikaz (ministry for the production/acquisition and sale of oil, gas, and antiquities) in al-Barakah and al-Khayr Provinces until his death in a U.S. Delta Force operation in May 2016 *Faysal Ahmad Ali al-Zahrani, ISIL's oil and gas division official for al-Barakah from September 2014. He still held this position by December 2015, and had by then also assumed responsibility for a VBIED production site at al-Shaddadah. *Abu Jihad al-Tunisi, media official for al-Barakah = Politics and governance = ISIL sign in al-Shaddadah which proclaims that \\"Whoever does not judge by what Allah has revealed - then it is those who are the disbelievers\\"; this edict was used as justification for several executions in al-Shaddadah. In governing al-Barakah, ISIL attempted to coopt local Arab tribes and clans. In doing so, it exploited lingering anti- Kurdish sentiment among al-Hasakah Governorate's Arab population. ISIL had originally \\"downplay[ed] accusations of anti-Kurdish racism\\" and presented itself as pan-Sunni organization which regarded ethnicity as unimportant. Consequently, a significant number of Kurds actually joined ISIL in al-Hasakah Governorate. Over time, however, ISIL's relations with the Kurdish population of Syria in general worsened due to the successes of the mostly Kurdish YPG/YPJ. As many Arabs feared Kurdish expansionism, ISIL thus started to present itself as defender of the Arab population and employed anti-Kurdish rhetoric. This tactic had some success, even convincing former Arab critics of ISIL that the jihadists' rule over al-Hasakah Governorate was preferable to the YPG/YPJ. Militant anti-Kurdish members of the Arab Tayy and Jibur tribes sided with ISIL in order to defend al-Barakah Province from the YPG-led Eastern al-Hasakah offensive of 2015. ISIL's governance of al-Barakah occasionally suffered from some internal turmoil: At some point in or after 2016, some local ISIL judges went on strike to protest the impunity with which ISIL security officials (\\"amnis\\") were allowed to act in al-Barakah. By this point, civilians had also voiced opposition to the security agents' behavior. Regardless, higher-ranking ISIL officials ignored the issue. In early 2014, ISIL was preparing to set up a \\"dhimmi pact\\" to deal with Christians living in al-Barakah Province, and ordered them to pay the jizya (a special tax for non- Muslims). At the time, the Jihadists were not yet officially forcing them to convert to Islam. Nevertheless, ISIL militants under al-Barakah's jurisdiction were known to abduct, ransom, persecute, and execute local Christians, sometimes disparagingly referred to as \\"crusaders\\" by ISIL followers. This ran contrary to the group's own portrayal of its policies, as al-Barakah's authorities claimed that they acted mercifully toward Christians while also proselytizing them. Most notably, al-Barakah's media center released a report in March 2015 according to which several Christians from Tell Tamer had voluntarily converted and \\"received the caliphate's blessing\\". A local journalist argued, however, that the converts had probably been threatened with torture or death. Accordingly, ISIL's version of the story was propaganda \\"to attract the sympathy of Muslims worldwide\\".  Media and propaganda  Al-Barakah has its own media channel, simply called \\"Al-Barakah Province\\" or \\"Al-Sham-Al-Barakah Province\\". The material released by this channel is often disseminateed by the Amaq News Agency and the Shumukh Agency. By 2015, al- Barakah was among the ISIL provinces with the highest propaganda output. In its propaganda, ISIL did not just present al-Barakah Province's governance as ideal and fair, but also promoted the beauty of its natural environment. The media output of the province was initially reduced along with its shrinking territory during 2017, but as the Euphrates holdings of ISIL came into focus as the Jihadist organization's last important territory in Syria, al-Barakah regained some prominence. By 2018, the main focus of al-Barakah's media channel was ISIL's resistance against the advancing SDF. = Military = Al- Barakah was part of the \\"Eastern Syria Command\\" of the military of ISIL by 2015. The number of ISIL fighters who served in the province varied over time. By mid-2014, the \\"Army of Hasakah\\" counted around 6,000 men; one its top commanders at the time was Abu Jandal al-Kuwaiti. In contrast, ISIL was only able to gather 4,500 troops for one of its last major offensives to expand al- Barakah in August 2015. Al-Barakah's regional military was known to include a unit of Southeast Asian child soldiers, called the \\"Putera Khilafa\\" (Princes of the Caliphate). ISIL also used a large number of armoured fighting vehicles at the frontlines of al-Hasakah Governorate.

He made his debut in first-class cricket for Ireland against Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in 1956 at Dublin. After his debut, he played a number of minor matches against Sussex in 1956, as well as the touring New Zealanders and Worcestershire, both in 1959. He made a second first-class appearance in 1959, against Leicestershire on Ireland's tour of England. He made two further first-class appearances, both in 1960 against Scotland at Paisley, and the MCC at Dublin. Across his four first-class matches, Neville scored a total of 143 runs at an average of 17.87, with a highest score of 38. Besides cricket, Neville also played several other sports to a high level. He played field hockey at international level for the Ireland national field hockey team, as well as playing football for Drumcondra and Dundalk as a goalkeeper, also winning four caps for the League of Ireland XI. He also played Gaelic football for Parnells in Dublin, however the 'Ban' resulted in Neville being banned from playing by the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA), after the GAA discovered him playing hockey under his mother's maiden name. Outside of sport, Neville worked as a psychiatric nurse. He died unexpectedly at Dublin in July 1977. The Neville Cup, contested annually by hockey clubs based in Leinster, is named after Neville and his brother, John.

He later wrote about business software for Upside.com. In March 2001, he joined TheStreet.com. From 2005 to 2006 he worked as a research analyst for a hedge fund before returning to TheStreet. He resigned in May 2017. Feuerstein accepted a position as a national biotechnology columnist at STAT in June 2017. Feuerstein is known for his style of reporting and his tweets to his large Twitter following. He often shares \\"unabashed\\" views on Biotech stock and the Food and Drug Administration.  Criticism  Feuerstein has been accused of publishing false or embellished stories in an effort to claim relevance as a journalist and bully companies, most recently in a series of attack stories on a company involved in testing the treatment Leronlimab on severe and critical COVID-19 patients. On July 13th, Cytodyn held an investor conference call where the company declared they fulfill all the requirements for Nasdaq uplisting and the application is ready to be submitted. Same day Feuerstein tweeted \\"Cytodyn admitted on Monday‚Äôs call that it doesn‚Äôt meet NASDAQ listing requirements, but announcing things that never happen, like multiple clinical trials and FDA approval submissions, is a deliberate stock- pumping strategy.\\". The tweet caused anger among shareholders who attended the meeting. Two days later Cytodyn filed Nasdaq uplisting application. Feuerstein has repeatedly been accused of lacking credibility when reporting on clinical trial outcomes given his lack of scientific background academically and professionally. Feuerstein is often the subject of criticism from different parties in the biotechnology sector.

De Groene Amsterdammer, 24 juni 2013 Wadland (2014), and Windwerk (2016), engaging with the landscape in an ongoing process of transformation. A hallmark of Spaan's approach is an active engagement with the design question, taking confluence as a starting point. Questioning the physical, social, and historical context in an ongoing process towards innovation of the architectural form.Tugelablokken.

It airs a nightly lineup of entirely Scottish programming. During daytime broadcast hours, the channel broadcasts a simulcast of BBC Two, but may opt out for news and sports events outside of its formal broadcast hours. The channel launched 24 February 2019, replacing the BBC Two Scotland opt-out of BBC Two, but operating as an autonomous channel (displacing BBC Four on Freeview in Scotland).  History  As of 2017, BBC Scotland had operated regional variations of BBC One and BBC Two for the Scottish region, as well as the Gaelic channel BBC Alba. On 22 February 2017, BBC director general Lord Hall announced that the corporation planned to replace BBC Two Scotland with a new, part-time BBC Scotland television channel, focused exclusively on Scottish programming. A feature of the channel would be an hour-long 9:00 p.m. weeknight newscast produced from Scotland, covering national and international headlines from a Scottish perspective. The proposed newscast was compared to the frequent proposals for a Scotland opt-out of the BBC News at Six. Hall also announced that the BBC would increase its overall spending on factual and drama productions in Scotland by ¬£20 million annually. Ofcom granted provisional approval to the new service in April 2018, but showed concerns for its proposal to only dedicate half of its lineup to new programmes (seeing it as removing potential opportunities for independent producers), and directed the BBC to ensure that the channel does not have an undue impact on competing news outlets (including newspapers and other broadcasters, with the former expressing concern that the BBC would poach employees from newspapers to build its expanded Scotland news operation). Ofcom granted final approval to the service in June 2018: the BBC subsequently announced a planned launch for February 2019. The channel will be allocated ¬£32 million in annual funding. In preparation for the launch of the new channel, BBC Two Scotland was discontinued and replaced by the networked version beginning 18 February. BBC Scotland launched 24 February at 7:00 p.m.; it signed on with an introductory video, featuring a performance of \\"Miracle\\" by the Scottish synthpop group Chvrches, accompanied by the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra. Its first programme was a variety special (A Night at the Theatre) hosted by comedian Iain Stirling. Opening night programming also included the broadcast television premiere of the documentary Nae Pasaran, the one-off Burnistoun special Burnistoun Tunes In, and the ninth and final series premiere of Still Game. Viewership peaked at 700,000.  Programming  BBC Scotland's main broadcast hours are 7:00 p.m. to midnight. At least 95% of programming must be of Scottish origin, and the BBC stated that roughly half of its programming would be new. Between noon and 7:00 p.m., the channel simulcasts the BBC Two schedule with BBC Scotland continuity, thereby accommodating the daytime sport and political programming opt-outs which had been displaced following the closure of BBC Two Scotland. The channel airs a 9:00 p.m. newscast, The Nine, presented by Rebecca Curran and Martin Geissler, which features coverage of national and international headlines from a Scottish perspective. On Wednesday nights there is a 15-minute programme aired called The Edit which covers the week's entertainment news. It is presented by Amy Irons and David Farrell. BBC Scotland has traditionally shown Sport on Friday evenings with Scottish Championship and the early rounds of the Scottish Cup matches featuring on Sportscene presented by Leanne Crichton and Steven Thompson from 7.00pm. With football talk show A View From The Terrace, adapted from the cult Terrace Scottish Football Podcast aired later on Friday evenings. AVFTT is produced by Edinburgh-based Studio Something and is presented by Craig Telfer, with analysis from Shaughan McGuigan, and The Scotsman Journalists Craig Fowler and Joel Sked. The first main programme to air on BBC Scotland was the Still Game Season 9 premier on the channel's first day.  Announcers  There are three main continuity announcers on the BBC Scotland channel. George Taylor, Dominic Main and Jennie Cook. * George Taylor from Glasgow worked in marketing for The Sunday Times and The Times Scotland. * Dominic Main from Drongan was a student at the University of the West of Scotland and has studied broadcast production for many years. * Jennie Cook from Kingussie is a former Capital Radio breakfast presenter. All continuity on the channel is performed live and is broadcast from Pacific Quay.

She was involved in the introduction of psychoactive mushrooms to a wide audience in the United States.  Life  Valentina Pavlovna Guercken was born in 1901 in Russia. When she was a baby, her family immigrated to the United States to escape the Russian Revolution. She grew up to become a pediatrician. In 1926, she married R. Gordon Wasson. The couple married in London, England. The couple went to the Catskill Mountains for their honeymoon in 1927. Wasson found edible mushrooms one day, but her new husband refused to eat them. They found that their diverging attitudes towards the plant was well documented in the folkloric traditions of Europe. They hypothesized that the peoples of the world could be separated into ‚Äúmycophiles‚Äù and ‚Äúmycophobes\\" ‚Äî for which they coined the term ‚Äî with the Slavs standing as the clearest example of the former, and the Anglo-Saxons of the latter. This led them to suspect some deep-seated and ancient taboo against the profane use of a religious sacrament, still practiced, as they discovered. The couple described themselves as \\"ethnomycologists\\" ‚Äî one who studies the cultural use of mushrooms and would pursue the study of mushrooms, particularly psychedelic mushrooms, for their 30 plus year career together.  Discovery and popularization of psychedelic mushrooms  In 1952 the poet Robert Graves sent the Wassons an article that mentioned the discovery in 1938. by Richard Evans Schultes, of the survival of the use of intoxicating mushrooms among the Indians in Mexico. Immediately Gordon Wasson telephoned Schultes at Harvard; the confirmation and encouragement he received focused his attention on Mexico. Tina and Gordon Wasson organized yearly research expeditions to the remote mountain villages of the monolingual Mazatec Indians of Oaxaca, Mexico, and in 1955 were the first outsiders in modern times to participate in the midnight rites of the cult of the sacred mushroom. Beginning in 1953, the Wassons travelled to Mexico, in the Mazatec village Huautla de Jim√©nez, to research the traditional use of mushrooms there. They received especially valuable information from an American missionary who had been active there for many years, Eunice V. Pike, member of the Wycliffe Bible Translators. Thanks to her knowledge of the native language and her ministerial association with the inhabitants, Pike had information about the significance of the magic mushrooms that nobody else possessed. During several lengthy sojourns in Huautla and environs, the Wassons were able to study the present use of the mushrooms in detail and compare it with the descriptions in the old chronicles. This showed that the belief in the \\"sacred mushrooms\\" was still prevalent in that region. However, the Indians kept their beliefs a secret from strangers. It took great tact and skill, therefore, to gain the confidence of the indigenous population and to receive insight into this secret domain. They announced their discovery in 1957 in their jointly written book Mushrooms Russia and History. The Wassons' first book, had begun as a cookbook by Wasson and the Wassons' Russian cook, Florence James. Concurrently, a lengthy illustrated article by R. Gordon in Life Magazine, May 13, 1957, on the Mexican mushroom veladas (sessions) with Maria Sabina gave rise to large numbers of individuals searching the wooded mountain regions of Mexico to discover for themselves the mushrooms with visionary powers. Wasson's account of this experience was published in This Week on May 19, 1957, six days after her husband's famous piece was published in Life magazine. In this article, Valentian becomes one of the first to suggest that psychedelic mushrooms might be used as a psychotherapeutic agent. She expressed the opinion that if the active agent could be isolated and a sufficient supply assured, it might become a vital tool in the study of psychic processes. She also stated that as the drug would become better known, medical uses would be found for it, perhaps in the treatment of alcoholism, narcotic addiction, mental disorders, and terminal diseases associated with severe pain. Several years later a team of researchers working in Baltimore independently tested the validity of her unusual vision. Her suggestion that transition to death could be eased by a dosage of LSD was followed by Aldous Huxley. Wasson died of cancer in 1958 at the age of 57. Following Wasson's death, Gordon continued their research, working closely with Roger Heim, a French mycologist and the director of the Museum National d‚ÄôHistoire Naturelle, who had accompanied the Wassons on several expeditions to Mexico  Bibliography  Recordings *Maria Sab√≠na - Mushroom Ceremony Of The Mazatec Indians Of Mexico.

In 1929 the library moved again, to two rooms, inside the IACM Building, then known as the Leal Senado Building. It moved to its Avenida do Conselheiro Ferreira de Almeida site in 1983. It received its current name in 1994, and that site received an interior renovation in the beginning part of 2007. That year, the Macau government announced that a replacement facility would be built. In 2018 the company MAA Marreiros Architectural Atelier Limited, owned by Carlos Marreiros, won the government contract to build the new library. The estimated cost would be 18.68 million patacas. Several publications accused Marreiros of copying the design of the auditorium of Leon, Spain. Marreiros denied the accusation. In 2010 Marreiros's company is to send its final plan for the library to the Macau authorities. Facility The , two storey facility is located on Avenida do Conselheiro Ferreira de Almeida.

The name Ellinthorp presumably comes from the Ellinthorp railway station, which was originally named Dalrymple after Dalrymple Creek, but which was renamed Ellinthorp on 28 January 1916 after the Tasmanian home of pastoralist brothers Charles George Henry Carr Clark and George John Edwin Clark of Talgai.

He is now an Emeritus Professor at Aberystwyth University, having previously taught at the University of the West of England and the University of Sussex. Over the course of his career he has written or co- edited fifteen books. He is known for being one of the pioneers behind the concept of cultural racism, which he termed \\"new racism\\". Barker received an undergraduate degree in philosophy from the University of Liverpool in 1967, after which he lectured in cultural studies at Bristol Polytechnic, later renamed the University of the West of England, from 1969 to 1998. Identifying as a committed socialist and anti-racist, during the 1970s, Barker focused his research on racism, in particular its place in British children's comics. Studying growing hostility to migrants in Britain, he coined the idea of \\"new racism\\"‚Äîlater known as cultural racism‚Äîand promoted this through his 1981 book The New Racism. His argument was that the concept of \\"racism\\", created in the 1930s to describe biological racism, should be extended to take into account prejudices against people on the basis of cultural difference. In 1995 he gained a DPhil from that university. He then worked as reader in media studies at the University of Sussex from 1998 to 2001, before becoming professor of film and television studies at the University of the West of England, where he remained until 2011, when he became professor emeritus. Much of his work in the 1990s and 2000s focused on media audiences, looking in particular at the audiences for fantasy fiction like The Lord of the Rings film trilogy and Game of Thrones. Biography Barker was born on 20 April 1946. He received an undergraduate degree in philosophy from the University of Liverpool in 1967. Barker worked for 29 years at the University of West England, becoming Head of the School of Cultural Studies, before spending 2 years as a reader at the University of Sussex. In January 2001, Barker was appointed as a Professor of Film and Television Studies at Aberystwyth University, where he is now an emeritus professor. Research and publications Barker has described himself as \\"a committed socialist all my adult life\\" and during the 1970s was a member of the International Socialists (IS) group. Committed to anti-racism, he came to believe that the IS's focus on combating the growth of the fascist National Front \\"didn't seem to me to be the heart of the matter\\" and that there was a larger issue at play in British society. Early in his academic career, Barker researched and published work on racism in the UK and children's comics, including Action and 2000 AD. He coined the term \\"new racism\\" in 1981 in the context of racist public discourse about immigration to the UK during the reign of Margaret Thatcher. In the 1980s, Barker became an outspoken critic of the video nasties censorship campaign in the UK, which was led by the Daily Mail and public pressure group the National Viewers' and Listeners' Association, spearheaded by Mary Whitehouse. A later book, Ill Effects: The Media Violence Debate, co-edited with Julian Petley, dismantled theories of ‚Äúmedia effects‚Äù and ‚Äúcopycat violence‚Äù inspired by violent media which were reported often as ‚Äúcommon sense‚Äù in the British press. Later in his career, Barker focused much more on studies of media audiences, drawing upon his background in cultural studies. His co-authored study of audiences of the Sylvester Stallone film, Judge Dredd, was influential in the field of audience studies. In response to the censorship campaign against David Cronenberg‚Äôs Crash, again by the Daily Mail, Barker, along with Jane Arthurs and Ramiswami Harindranath, oversaw and authored a study on the film's reception in the press and conducted an audience study. This was published as The Crash Controversy: Censorship Campaigns and Film Reception by Wallflower Press in 2001. Over the course of these and other audience studies, Barker developed a methodology for studying audiences which to date remains very influential in the field. At Aberystwyth University, Barker was commissioned by British film censors, the BBFC, to produce research on audiences and issues around watching sexual violence on screen. He has recently been an outspoken critic of recent research used by the BBFC to justify implementing tighter censorship. Barker served as director on an ESRC-funded international audience research project on The Lord of the Rings which resulted in Watching Lord of the Rings: Tolkien's World Audiences. A follow-up project was overseen by Barker, studying audience responses to The Hobbit, which involved 145 researchers in 46 countries. It received 36, 109 responses and is the largest audience study ever conducted. He is currently directing the international Game of Thrones audience study. Barker has specialised in the study of media audiences, and is presently overseeing an international audience research project on Game of Thrones.

Early life  Arlene Anderson Skutch was born April 4, 1924 and lived in Fostoria, Ohio with her mother Ruth, father Lorenz, and sister Betty.  Career  Prior to her career as a visual artist, Arlene had a successful career as a singer in several Broadway musicals, most notably for 725 performances in Finian's Rainbow from 1947‚Äì1948 as well as 657 performances of Bloomer Girl 1944‚Äì1946 and a short run of the revival of George and Ira Gershwin's Of Thee I Sing . Her father, Lorenz Anderson, was an accomplished concert violinist and toured much of the mid- west at beginning of the 20th century with his classical trio. Lorenz fostered the love and study of music in his two daughters and urged them to pursue professional acting and singing in New York City in 1945. Arlene moved there with her sister Betty and auditioned as a duet. They were exceptional singers and were constantly employed in the casts of major theatrical productions. Arlene worked with many luminaries of musical theater; Ira Gershwin, Harold Arlen, Burton Lane, Yip Harburg, Michael Kidd, Agnes de Mille, John Raitt, Celeste Holm, Ella Logan, David Wayne and others. Arlene eventually left the theater and married screenwriter, advertising executive, and publisher of A Course in Miracles, Robert Skutch. The couple moved to Westport, Connecticut in 1952 and bought an 1876 saltbox colonial house they restored and painted pink after honeymooning in Cuba where they admired the brightly painted houses on the island. At that time, Arlene also had a brief stint on CBS radio's \\"FBI in Peace and War\\" and television with John Raitt on \\"The Buick Circus Hour.' Arlene had two children, Laura and Andrew but was divorced from Robert in 1965 and remained in the Pink House in Westport. The house had a studio on the property that was designed by the famous postmodern architect Eliot Noyes which she eventually began to use as her art studio. She began to study with local painting instructors Ann Chernow, Gusti Wyman, Charles Reid, and Constance Kiermaier at Silvermine School of Art in New Canaan, CT when her children started school.  Notable achievements  Arlene's most notable achievement aside from producing a vast body of work is mentoring dozens of students over a 42 year teaching career. Her \\"Pink House Painters\\" collective was a tightly knit group of local painters who gathered weekly for instruction in Arlene's studio. The artists of the Pink House Painters exhibited regularly and earned regional recognition and awards. Arlene received a certificate in 1994 as an art teacher who had a \\"most significant influence on the development of a young artist\\" in the 1993‚Äì1994 National Foundation for Advancement in the Arts Talent Search. Arlene was a featured artists in \\"Years in the Making\\" a documentary highlighting the careers of many notable Westport Connecticut artists over the age of 70. (Westport is a hub for the fine arts with many well known accomplished actors, musicians and visual artists making their home in Westport, Connecticut.) In 2012, Arlene was also added, posthumously, to the Westport Arts Awards \\"Heritage Honor Roll\\" which \\"honors local artists who have passed away...[as] significant members of Westport's artistic heritage.\\" Literary giant JD Salinger was also inducted with 8 others alongside Arlene.

Those killed were two policemen, two Pakistani civilians and the three attackers. No Chinese nationals were hurt in the attack. The three attackers were also killed. Attack According to the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) officer Raja Umar Khattab, the attackers shot and killed the two policemen at the first check-post. The attackers then detonated hand grenades and also tried to open the main armored gate of the consulate with the help of C-4 explosives but did not succeed. The heavy firing and hand grenade blasts killed two civilians, and damaged one armored personnel carrier, two police vehicles and six other cars parked outside the consulate, of which three caught fire. Policewoman Suhai Aziz Talpur, a senior superintendent of the Karachi Police, told reporters, \\"Around 9 am, I got the news that there was an attack at the Chinese consulate. I was already on my way to work so we redirected and rushed to the crime scene. I already had my guards with me, senior officers were on their way. In the meantime we gathered the bomb disposal squad and fire brigade as well.\\" She organized and led the two-hour battle to defend the consulate. The battle ended after all three attackers were killed. According to Reuters, \\"Her fast response and actions during the nearly two-hour assault on the diplomatic mission in the southern port city have been praised for saving countless lives.\\" She has been hailed as a hero in both Pakistan and China. =Victims= The policemen killed at the check-post were identified as Assistant Sub Inspector Ashraf Dawood and Constable Muhammad Amir by the Sindh Police. The two civilians killed were a father and son from Quetta, named Niaz Muhammad, 55, and Zahir Shah, 25, respectively; at the time they were waiting to renew their visas at the consulate. A private security guard Muhammad Jumman employed by the consulate was injured in the blast when he tried to stop the attackers from going past the barriers. Investigation A first information report registered by Sindh Police's CTD on behalf of the state through Boat Basin SHO, booked BLA chief Hyrbyair Marri and twelve of his aides, including BLA commander Mian Aslam alias 'Achu' alias Meeraq Baloch, for masterminding and facilitating the attack. Police identified one of the attackers through fingerprints matched with National Database and Registration Authority records as Abdul Razzaq, son of Din Muhammad. On 24 November 2018, Balochistan Home Minister Mir Saleem Ahmed Khoso said that two brothers of Abdul Razzaq were arrested in Kharan. According to AIG Dr Amir Shaikh, the attack was planned in Afghanistan and conducted with the support of India's spy agency Research and Analysis Wing with the aim of sabotaging the China- Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). Perpetrators The Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for the attack in a tweet that included a photo of three men identified as Azal Khan Baloch, Razik Baloch and Rais Baloch. All of them were killed by police during the attack. According to Express News, Aslam alias Achu - a commander of proscribed BLA, the mastermind of the attack on Chinese consulate was receiving medical treatment at the time at Max Hospital in New Delhi, India. Aslam Baloch alias Achu was later killed in a suicide attack in Kandahar on 25 December 2018. BLA spokesman confirmed Aslam Achu and five other BLA commanders' death in Kandahar. Reactions Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan condemned the attack stating, \\"let there be no doubt in anyone's mind that we will crush the terrorists, whatever it takes.\\" He said that \\"the attack was intended to scare Chinese investors and undermine CPEC\\" while adding \\"these terrorists will not succeed.\\" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang during a regular press briefing said that \\"China strongly condemns any violent attacks against diplomatic agencies.\\" He further said that the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor project would proceed despite the attack. The Deputy Chief of Mission at the Chinese embassy, Zhao Lijian, expressed appreciation for the Pakistan Army and police for their \\"timely and proper action\\" in response to the attack. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, India, released an official statement on the day of the attack itself, saying that India strongly condemns the terror attack and that \\"the perpetrators of this heinous attack should be brought to justice expeditiously\\".

It is in the permanent collection of the Pinakothek der Moderne‚ÄîPinakothek of modern art‚Äîin central Munich's Kunstareal. Provenance Galerie Neue Kunst Fides 1926 The Limits of Reason was first exhibited in 1926 in Rudolf Probst's Galerie Neue Kunst Fides in Dresden, along with 99 other tempera/water colors by Klee. German art dealer, art collector, journalist and publisher, Alfred Flechtheim (1878 ‚Äì 1937) acquired it for his private collection in 1928 and displayed it in his gallery in both 1928 and 1929. In 1931, he loaned it to the MoMa in New York. By 1958 the painting, which has an inventory number, 14234 was owned by Theodor and Woty Werner. In 1971, with Erich Steingr√§ber as museum director, through the Werners' legacy,Grenzen des Verstandes, became part of the permanent collection of the Bavarian State Painting Collection‚Äîthe Pinakothek der Moderne‚ÄîPinakothek museum of modern art in Munich. Description The work has been described as emblematic of \\"his most prolific period as a teacher\\" at the Bauhaus. The static nature of the perfect red sphere which appears frozen and floating in space, in the white primed canvas of the upper part of the painting, contrasts with the dynamic complicated filigree linear structure of the lower part of the painting. This work is reminiscent of that of Kasimir Malevich in both color and structure. In her article in The Atlantic, Veronique Greenwood described the gap between the two as a gap between the human capacity of reason and the human desire to fully understand. Background The painting was produced during his \\"most prolific period\\"‚Äîthe years spent at the Bauhaus, a German art school‚Äîwhich was established by Walter Gropius in Weimar in 1919 and closed in 1933, \\"when the Nazis enforced their own definitions of art and its functions\\". Klee, alongside artists such as Gropius, Wassily Kandinsky, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Anni and Josef Albers, was a teacher and resident artist. In his 2009 book, Nicolas Fox Weber The Bauhaus Group: Six Masters of Modernism, Weber wrote that Klee \\"brought the liberating spirit of surrealism to the Bauhaus\\". The 1988 book published by MoMa, entitled, Paul Klee: The Berggruen Klee Collection in The Metropolitan Museum of Art, described Klee as one of the most popular artists in the 20th century and one of \\"the most written about\\".The MoMa holds the largest collection of Klee's work in North America which is featured in a 1988 book published by MoMa, entitled, Paul Klee: The Berggruen Klee Collection in The Metropolitan Museum of Art. The book includes the entire MoMa collection donated by Heinz Berggruen, a leading art dealer and collector form the period following World War II. Klee produced over 9,000 works. Klee was the son of a musicologist and he drew parallels between sound and art.Time (1960) The painting has been described as surrealist. Along with other works by Klee during the Bauhaus period in Dessau, it has also been called interpretative, and later, constructivist. His work has been compared to works by Malevich, Gabo and Tatlin. This painting has similarities to other works by Klee, such his Rope Tilers. Critical analysis In his 1930 publication Paul Klee, Ren√© Crevel contrasted Klee's work with that of romanticism, situating Klee as an artist after The Flood. Crevel described a ladder, or a set of stairs, lost in red ether, as the only means of us to take a leap into the impossible, to jump so high, as if on a trampoline, and to latch onto the moon... \\"cette √©chelle rouge perdue au sein de l‚Äô√©ther tourterelle.

Its classification has changed many times over its history to better reflect the information available at the time. Currently, M. chartarum is known to be an ascomycete surrounded by a gymnothecium composed of ornate spines and releases asexual ascospores. The presence of cellulolytic processes are common in fungi within the family Myxotrichaceae. M. chartarum is one of many Myxotrichum species known to degrade paper and paper products. Evidence of M. chartarum \\"red spot\\" mold formation, especially on old books, can be found globally. As a result, this fungal species and other cellulolytic molds are endangering old works of art and books. Currently, there is no evidence that suggests that species within the family Myxotrichaceae are pathogenic. History and taxonomy Myxotrichum chartarum was discovered by Gustav Kunze in 1823, along with another species in the new genus Myxotrichum, Myxotrichum murorum. There has been much confusion within the genus Myxotrichum due to numerous revisions in classification over the years and the scarcity of isolations. Eventually, the genus, Myxotrichum became associated with ascomycota fungi which are dematiaceous hyphomycetes, commonly known as black yeasts or moulds. At the microscopic level, these fungi have a mesh-like surrounding structures, peridium, with hooked appendages. It was mistakenly placed in the genus Oncidium by Nees, also in 1823, though that name which was already in use for a genus of orchid, giving Myxotrichum priority. In 1838, August Carl Joseph Corda classified M. chartarum as a hyphomycete in the family Sporotrichacheae, as species belonging to this family had ornate appendages resembling deer antlers. In 1854, Corda separated M. chartarum from Myxotrichum into the newly established genus, Actinospira because he believed it to produce conidia rather than ascospores. In 1959, Kuehn, among other investigators, reviewed the status of the family Gymnoascaceae and placed M. chartarum into the ascomycetous genus, Myxotrichum rather than the newly established genus for conidial forms, Myxotrichella. In 1875, Fuckel declared M. chartarum to be the conidial form of Chaetomium kunzeanum. Fries thought M. chartarum was a conidial form of Chaetomium chartarum. His opinion was supported by Boulanger in 1897. Their revelation was founded because of the high resemblance between Chaetomium and Myxotrichum fungal families due to the presence of ornamental hairs. In 1889, Richon thought M. chartarum was the conidial form of Cephalotheca sulfurea, disputing the claim of Fuckel. In 1891, Constantin showed that M. chartarum belonged to the newly established family, ascomycete of the family Gymnoascaceae, for ascomycetes that lacked true cleistothecia or perithecia. In 1892, Rabenhorst classified M. chartarum into the order Gymnoascaceae. This was later supported by Schroter in 1893. Fischer later recognized the existence of ascospores in M. chartarum, but a distinct lack of conidial structures. In 1893, Schroeter reviewed family Gymnoascaceae and placed species with uncinate appendages within the genus, Myxotrichum without regard for other characteristics. Different forms of M. chartarum were isolated by Robak and Udagawa that resembled a phenotypically similar species. The isolate discovered by Robak (1932) of M. carminoparum resembled M. chartarum in every way except in the characteristically flattened apical area. Another isolate was discovered by Udagawa (1963) to have flattened appendages, but the size of the ascomata was smaller, resembling those from M. carminoparum. Later, the species, M. chartarum and M. carminoparum were merged due to the high resemblance between the two species. Growth and morphology Intercalary arthroconidia of Myxotrichum chartarum (UAMH 10244) from colony grown for 36d, photographed in Phase Contrast microscopy. =Growth in its natural environment= The ascospores can also be described as being yellow to orange in colour with a rounded football shape having longitudinal striations and a diameter between 6-8 Œºm on the long side and 5-8 ¬µm on the short side. Asci appear hyaline, globular, and contain the typical quantity of 8 ascospores each, the size of which are 3-5 ¬µm on the long side and 2-3 ¬µm on the short side. When the spores mature, they are released en masse, producing a cloud of brown-coloured dust. Ascocarps appear dark and spherical with short appendages, and when filled with its yellow to orange spores, the ascocarp can appear green or copper. The diameter of the ascocarp is 150-555Œºm. The spore mass fills the ascocarps between one-third and three-fourths of the total volume at peak maturity. The surrounding Gymnothecium has septate appendages that are straight and elongated. Branching points present as uncinate, or curved spines that are wider or flattened at the apices. Commonly found in Myxotrichum species are the secondary and tertiary branching of peridial hyphae. These branches can be identified by the lighter colouring in comparison to the ascocarp of the fungi, or truncation that results from the fragility of such branching. These truncations were previously thought to have been the release of conidiophores, but no evidence was found on initial conidiophore attachment. =Life cycle= There are few records of the asexual or anamorphic stage within the family Gymnascaceae. Descriptions made by Kuehn (1955) and Robak (1932) described oidia and chlamydospores, though rare in occurrence. However, Benjamin (1956) acknowledged that there were indeed arthrospores and aleuriospores present in Gymnascaceae. The anamorphs of M. chartarum may belong to the genera, Malbranchea and Oidiodendron. =Growth in laboratory culture= In culture and grown at 25 ¬∞C, M. chartarum appears yellow and fluffy. Some cultures had areas that were black in appearance, which were due to visible mature ascomata. However, growth was restricted at this temperature, as fungi in the family Myxotrichaceae have a preference for temperatures below 18 ¬∞C. At temperatures of 18 ¬∞C, the fungus grew at 2 cm a month. Optimal growing temperatures were described as being between +5 and +7 ¬∞C. Production of a red-brown pigment when grown on mycelia and on certain culture media, functions to detoxify the surrounding environment. This is due to a reaction produced by the laccases secreted in the presence of polyphenols. The presence of pigmentation occurs early on for polyphenol detection. However, this effect weakens when the fungus is exposed to higher levels of polyphenols, indicating metabolic function inhibition caused by the presence of these compounds. Habitat and ecology M. chartarum is known for its inhabitation of paper and paper products. The specific epithet, chartarum, originated from the Latin word for paper and is in reference to its initial discovery from paper in books, and its ability to decay these materials through the production of cellulose-degrading enzymes (cellulases). It was deemed a ‚Äúmaterial pathogen‚Äù, since it is able to degrade specific materials for a source of nutrition. It has also been recorded to inhabit other materials such as, drywall, straw, decaying leather, cloth, grouse dung, rabbit dung, bat guano, soil, leaves and fruit. Reports of M. chartarum have come from around the world. Known distribution areas are as follows: Germany, Russia, Italy, France, Switzerland, England, Japan, Austria-Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Maine, Massachusetts, Ontario, New York. The endemic region of this fungus is currently unknown. The presence of curved spines allow the fungus to adhere to the fur of animals, allowing the fungus to disperse to other areas. It has been observed by multiple researchers that M. chartarum exhibited slow growth between temperatures of 5-7 ¬∞C, so this fungus is classified as a psychrophilic organism. However, no growth was observed at 37 ¬∞C and since it is unable to grow at the human body temperature, this fungus is not a disease agent or an opportunistic pathogen. As found by Tribe and Weber (2002), optimal growth in culture can be achieved on mineral salt agar with a sheet of Cellophane as the only carbon source. In basements or cellars, M. chartarum has a preference for gypsum board ceilings and building paper on concrete surfaces on the cold side of foundation walls. For optimal growth, it requires a relative humidity of greater than 98%. Salinity and pH preferences are unknown, but it is thought to be halo-tolerant.

If a school is oversubscribed, the distance from applicants' homes to the nodal point can be used for prioritising admissions. This can ensure the school not only serves pupils closest to it but also those living in other areas, for example areas that have more limited access to school places. Nodal points are sometimes known as Admissions Points or Centroid Points. The term nodal point is also sometimes used to define a specific location on school premises to which home- school distance will be measured.  Usage  Nodal admissions points are used by some local authorities to mitigate the effects of the Greenwich Judgement on their statutory duty to provide sufficient school places for local children. They are also used by schools which are not located within, or near the centre of, the area that they are intended to serve, or by schools which have opened at a temporary location, pending a move to a permanent site. Some schools that are intended to serve a wide area, or several dispersed areas, use transport hubs such as train stations as nodal points. Nodal points have also been used to ensure a mixed socio-economic intake, and put forward as a potential means of resolving school access issues in rural areas.
