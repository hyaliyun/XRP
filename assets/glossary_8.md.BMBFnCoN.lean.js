It is a modern retelling of Shakespeare's Macbeth, set in a 1930s American criminal underworld. The film's plot closely follows that of Shakespeare's original play. A similar adaptation, Men of Respect, was released in 1990, starring John Turturro, Rod Steiger and Dennis Farina. Plot Hit man Joe MacBeth goes directly from the assassination of crime boss Duke's second-in-command Tommy to his own wedding, where bride Lily scolds him for being two hours late. Duke rewards him with a mansion by a lake. A fortune teller persuades Lily, however, that Joe's destiny is to be the leader, not a follower. Lily is ruthlessly ambitious. After he personally eliminates Duke's gluttonous rival, Big Dutch, at a restaurant, Lily continues to goad Joe into going after his own boss. After eliminating his crime ally Banky and alienating Banky's son Lennie, an evening at the lakeside mansion ends with Duke inviting the lovely Lily to go for a swim. Once in the water, though, Duke is stabbed in the back by Joe and left to die. Lily dives in to make sure. Although he expresses outrage that someone has murdered their boss, Joe is not believed by Lennie, who suspects the truth. Joe begins to be haunted by nightmares and visions. One night, when he believes Lennie's men have come to kill him, Joe takes a machine gun and opens fire at a moving curtain. Lily falls dead. Joe's own violent end is about to follow.

The line crossed the river Rhine on a bridge between Breisach and Neuf-Brisach. Since that bridge was destroyed in 1945, the line from Freiburg has terminated at Breisach, and this stretch of line is now commonly called the Freiburg‚ÄìBreisach railway, or the Breisacherbahn. The section from Freiburg to Breisach was completed in 1871 and the remainder in 1878. History Proposals were made in the town of Breisach for the construction of a railway from Breisach to Freiburg as early as 1846. A project for a railway from Freiburg to Nancy via Breisach, Colmar, Munster and the Vosges was presented in Colmar in 1860. The Rhine would be crossed at Breisach using a \\"flying bridge\\" (reaction ferry). On the German side, it was planned to extend the line from Freiburg through the H√∂llental through the Black Forest towards Ulm and Lake Constance. The concept of the Colmar‚ÄìFreiburg railway forming part of an international long-distance connection from Paris to Vienna through the Vosges and the Black Forest was never carried out. In 1864, the towns of Breisach and Freiburg decided to participate in a company for the construction of the railway. A railway committee planned to build a line from Freiburg to Breisach via Hugstetten, Oberschaffhausen (B√∂tzingen) and Wasenweiler, but the planning was delayed by, among other things, the Austro- Prussian War of 1866. On 11 February 1868, the Baden government passed the Gesetz zum Bau einer Eisenbahn zwischen Freiburg und Breisach (\\"law on the construction of a railway between Freiburg and Breisach\\") and granted a concession for the line on 21 April 1868. One reason for the construction of the railway was the transport of wood from the Black Forest to the Rhine and coal from the Saarland to Freiburg. In order to finance railway construction Freiburg and Breisach took a loan of 1.2 million Goldmarks at 4.5 % from the Basler Bankierverein (Basel banking association). The route was changed in favour of a shorter and cheaper route from Hugstetten to Wasenweiler via Gottenheim in 1869. Ground was broken on 7 June 1870. The opening of the line was delayed to 14 September 1871 as a result of personnel and material bottlenecks caused by the Franco-Prussian War. The private railway was operated by the Grand Duchy of Baden State Railways from the beginning. = Breisach‚ÄìColmar extension= Volgelsheim station As a result of the Franco- Prussian War, Alsace was part of the German Empire as Alsace-Lorraine from 1871. The war delayed further construction of the railway for several years. Since Breisach was no longer a border station and the originally planned rooms for customs and border control were no longer required, only a temporary station building was opened in 1871. After the signing of a state treaty between the Grand Duchy of Baden and the German Empire in 1874, which set out responsibilities in the extension of the line, construction began in 1875 on the Rhine bridge near Breisach, which was opened to traffic on 5 January 1878. In the license granted in 1875 for the operation of a railway from Altbreisach to Colmar, it was stipulated that the state railway would lease the entire line from the Freiburg-Breisach Railway Company to the middle of the Rhine for an unlimited period of time if the Grand Ducal government did not exercise its right of repurchase. The line to Colmar was completed on 7 January 1878. Trains took about 70 minutes to traverse the Freiburg‚ÄìColmar line. = Operation of the line until the destruction of the Rhine bridge= Since interest rates had dropped massively and the state was able to pay the purchase price of 1,687,100 Goldmarks, the Baden Landtag (state assembly) gave its consent to buy back the line, which was nationalised on 6 December 1881. The Hugstetten rail disaster occurred on 3 September 1882, resulting in 64 dead and 230 seriously injured, the worst rail accident in Germany up to that time. With the construction of the private Kaiserstuhl Railway, the Breisach Railway was connected in Gottenheim to the line to Riegel Ort and Endingen in 1894 and in Breisach to the line to Endingen and Riegel in 1895. In order to ensure the profitability of the Kaiserstuhl Railway, all rail freight running from Colmar and Breisach to the north on the Rhine Valley Railway, no longer ran via Freiburg, but directly via the Kaiserstuhl Railway to Riegel station on the Rhine Valley Railway. An express connection was established between Freiburg and Colmar in 1910. The temporary structure at Breisach station was replaced by the current entrance building in 1914. The line between Breisach and Colmar saw a significant increase in traffic due to military traffic in the First World War. The Neuf-Brisach‚ÄìBantzenheim branch line was built in 1917 at the instigation of the German military. Since Alsace had been returned to France in 1918, Breisach again became a border station and the importance of the Breisach Railway decreased significantly. In the Second World War, the Rhine bridge at Breisach was blown up for the first time in 1939, repaired and then completely destroyed during the German retreat in 1945. The line to Colmar has been interrupted since then. The current road bridge was built on the foundations of the former railway bridge. Two intact bridge parts were transported by barge to Neuenburg on 1 and 26 February 1946 and used to repair the Neuenburg‚ÄìChalamp√© Rhine Bridge on the M√ºllheim‚ÄìMulhouse railway, which was also destroyed in the retreat. Despite repeated discussions, proposals to reconstruct the Breisach bridge have always failed due to the cost of a new bridge. = Since the destruction of the Rhine bridge =  Colmar‚ÄìVolgelsheim line (French section)  The French railway company, SNCF, operated passenger services between Colmar and Volgelsheim after the Second World War, but closed them in 1969. Only two freight trains still run daily from Colmar to the Rhine port near Marckolsheim. In 1982, the Chemin de Fer Touristique du Rhin was founded, which operates a heritage railway service on the French part of the line. This is made possible, among other things, by the Colmar Chamber of Commerce leasing it the Volgelsheim‚ÄìMarckolsheim line free of charge.  Breisach‚ÄìFreiburg line (German section)  Signals and points in Breisach In the summer of 1960, Deutsche Bundesbahn operated 36 passenger trains (including ten multiple units) on Sundays, working days and public holidays, most of them one-class trains. Deutsche Bundesbahn for a time threatened the gradual thinning of services, so that the line could eventually be closed. The line has been in the area managed by the Regio-Verkehrsverbund Freiburg (Freiburg Regional Transport Association, RVF) since 1994. The proposal for the Breisgau S-Bahn (BSB), presented in 1995, envisaged the introduction of an S-Bahn operation with regular traffic and innovative lightweight railcars on the Freiburg‚ÄìBreisach line as a pilot service. Services on the Kaiserstuhl Railway would also be improved and integrated into the proposed network. On 1 June 1997, the management of the Freiburg‚ÄìBreisach railway was taken over by the Breisgau-S-Bahn, which was founded in 1996 as a subsidiary of both the S√ºdwestdeutsche Verkehrs-Aktiengesellschaft (SWEG) and the Freiburger Verkehrs AG (VAG), each holding 50%. Until operations were taken over by the Breisgau S-Bahn, the Freiburg‚ÄìBreisach railway had always been operated by a state Railway, now Deutsche Bahn, which still owns the line. Nine Regio-Shuttle RS1 diesel multiple units (VT 001 to 009) were procured by SWEG from Adtranz in conjunction with Regio-Shuttles of the same design but differently painted also procured by SWEG for the Kaiserstuhl Railway, which were located at the Endingen rolling stock depot. Between 1999 and 2003, traffic increased from 6,000 to 9,000 passengers per working day on a line that was temporarily by closure under Deutsche Bundesbahn for a while. Together with the Elz Valley Railway (Elztalbahn), which was also taken over in 2002, the BSB more than quadrupled its passenger numbers from 1.5 million passengers in 1999 to around 6.5 million passengers by 2006. In freight traffic, the BSB takeover resulted in a shift in traffic flows, since the freight trains that used to run from Breisach via the Kaiserstuhl Railway to Riegel-Malterdingen and the Rhine Valley Railway have since been transferred at the Freiburg G√ºterbahnhof (Freiburg freight yard). Freight traffic has been carried by SWEG on the line to the Freiburg freight yard and to the northern industrial area since 2007 under a partnership between SWEG and DB Cargo. The cooperation agreement between RVF and Nahverkehrsgesellschaft Baden- W√ºrttemberg (\\"Baden-W√ºrttemberg local transport company\\", NVBW) of 11 March 2009 provided for the electrification of the S-Bahn network of the Freiburg region by 2019. In this first stage of the Breisgau-S-Bahn 2020 project, the Freiburg‚ÄìBreisach line was also electrified to allow a connection without changing between Breisach and Villingen, which was also on a non-electrified section of the line between Neustadt and Donaueschingen. Only about two kilometres of the line from Freiburg station to Neue Messe/Universit√§t station were already electrified. The station, which was opened in 2000, was built on the location of Heidenhof junction where one of two curves connected to the Freiburg freight bypass until 1945.  S-Bahn  The line between Freiburg and Gottenheim was electrified from 1 February to the end of November 2019 as part of the Breisgau-S-Bahn 2020 project and went into operation on 15 December 2019. The line from Gottenheim to Breisach followed in February 2020. Mechanical signal boxes of the Einheit class were operated in Gottenheim until January 2019 and in Breisach until December 2019. Signalling at both stations is now remotely controlled from the \\"Breisach\\" work station at the electronic control centre in Freiburg-Wiehre. In the 2020 timetable, services were planned to be coupled or split every half hour in Gottenheim and hourly in Titisee. Due to problems in Gottenheim the point of separation was changed to Endingen a. K. In addition, there is only an hourly train between Titisee and Seebrugg on Sundays. However, trains kept failing, which was not well communicated. Therefore, a modified, less complicated timetable concept has applied to line S1 since 17 February 2020 under which the shuttle service between Gottenheim and Endingen a. K. remains; the coupling or splitting of trains is therefore no longer required in Gottenheim. This is intended to stabilise the timetable and ensure reliable operation. Those responsible want to return to the old timetable concept in June.

Lewis and Clark took three gross of curtain rings with them on their famous expedition to the Pacific coast in 1804, expecting to give them as presents to the natives of the North American interior. In the 19th century, Mr Rees designed a curtain ring which would not catch upon the curtain rail and so would go smoothly around curves and corners. Such rings may be used as improvisations in other ways. For example, they may be used as a wedding ring to solemnise a marriage ceremony; or as a ligature to prevent nocturnal enuresis (bedwetting).

He was born in Bristol, England, in 1819. John Wind designed the Greenwood, Susina, Oak Lawn, Pebble Hill, Eudora and Fair Oaks monumental plantation houses, the Thomas county courthouse and a few in-town cottages. William Warren Rogers writes \\"Some of Wind's work still exists and reveals him as one of the South's most talented but, unfortunately, least known architects.\\" John Wind also worked as an inventor, jeweler, master mechanic and surveyor. He devised a clock that remained wound for one year and was awarded a patent for a cotton thresher and cleaner, Patent Number 5369. He was also the co-recipient of a corn husker and sheller patent in 1860. But it was his work as an architect that made him an enduring figure. His first commission Circa 1838, merchant and planter Jackson J. Mash brought John Wind from New York city to Duncanville, Georgia, to design a large house for his plantation. Later, the area was identified as Mashes on railroad maps and as Susina from 1888 to 1906. It is now Beachton, or on a few maps, Moncrief slightly to the south. No known photographs exist for the Mash work. The house was brick, with four large columns supporting a portico with a small balcony under the portico and over the front door. The Southern Enterprise newspaper described it as a \\"fine mansion, where spacious apartments, gorgeous furniture (are housed).\\" The building cost between $12,000 and $15,000. This house burned in 1876. Traditional Greek Revival The Greek Revival began waning in the United States circa 1840, but not in the South, where it remained a popular form. The Greek Revival style \\"was Wind's idiom and he utilized it to the point of near perfection.\\" This idiom was a large portico supported by large two-story columns with Ionic capitals and a full entablature. The pediment included a decorative carving of a flower rosette. Under the portico was a cantilevered balcony with balusters of wheat and sheaf design. Under the balcony were double doors with sidelights and a fixed transom. Windows were nine over nine lights with triangular pediments. The basic plan is four over four with an enclosed breezeway the full length of the house. A 180 degree curved staircase rises from the right to the left on the second level. This form is common to Greenwood, Susina and Oak Lawn. Wind is known to have overseen construction and carved woodwork for at least some of his commissions. John Wind was commissioned, circa 1838‚Äì1840, by one of the early settlers to Thomas county, Thomas Jones, to design a third house at Greenwood Plantation, just west of Thomasville, Georgia. Local stories often claim Greenwood was \\"completed during a nine-year period from 1835 to 1844.\\" At Greenwood, the portico covers the full facade, producing a rather massive appearance. Sometime c. 1899, the owner Colonel Oliver Hazard Payne, commissioned noted architect Stanford White. White was the architect of Rosecliff and Madison Square Garden II among other notable buildings. White suggested few changes because of the existing \\"perfection\\" of Wind's Greek Revival design. He added two small, symmetric side wings and additional living and kitchen space in the rear. The evening of April 2, 1993, during a celebration of a just completed $2 million restoration, Greenwood caught fire and little except the exterior brick walls and two columns were saved. The exterior has been restored but the interior has not. Greenwood is held by the Greentree Foundation. Circa 1841, James Joseph Blackshear, hired John Wind to design a house for his plantation Cedar Grove in Duncanville. James J. Blackshear married Harriet Jones, the sister of Thomas Jones of Greenwood. At Cedar Grove, the portico spans about 2/3 of the facade. The partial-width portico results in a less massive and perhaps more elegant appearance. The exterior of Cedar Grove is wood clapboard except under the portico where the siding is set flush to resemble stone. The rooms on the right (north) side of the house were not as deep as on the left, and this rear area included a covered porch. In 1887, Dr. John Metcalfe of New York acquired Cedar Grove and renamed it Susina. In 1891, A. Heywood Mason of Philadelphia acquired Susina and added the side porches and modified the rear kitchen wing. At a later date the dining room was increased by enclosing a portion of the south porch, and the rear porch was replaced with added rooms on both levels. The architect of these renovations is unknown, but the additions complement Wind's original vision. Susina Plantation is extant and the only Wind plantation home not touched or destroyed by fire. Circa 1850, Mitchell B. Jones hired John Wind to design Oak Lawn. Mitchell Jones was a brother of Thomas Jones. This was Wind's largest plantation house. Like Greenwood and Susina, Oak Lawn remained true to Greek Revival. It had an octastyle portico that projected from a full-width portico, all supported by eight, two-story fluted columns. Rather than cantilevered, the balcony was supported by six single-story square pillars, similar to those of Fair Oaks. Like the portico, the balcony had a small projection of the center section. It was perhaps the finest of Wind's work. It was destroyed by fire in May 1883. Later styles Also circa 1850, John W. H. Mitchell hired John Wind to design the second house Pebble Hill. This single-story structure was Classical Revival and bore little resemblance to Wind's other designs except in details. The windows in each of the two pediments were identical to the window originally in the pediment of Fair Oaks. The basic plan was H-shaped with eight rooms and a wide hall. Porches with square pillars ran toward the entry door with embellished sidelights and a transom. This house was destroyed by fire in 1934. A replica of the house is located on the SW side of the Pebble Hill property near the Fair Oaks house. The current monumental house, open to the public at Pebble Hill, is not a Wind design. John Spain was the stepson of Thomas Jones brother, Major Francis Jones. Also circa 1850, Spain hired John Wind to design what later was named Eudora Plantation, east of Thomasville in what is now Brooks County. It included a full-facade portico with entablature supported by six two-story, fluted Doric columns made of cypress. The entablature continued around the house and included carved brackets that appear to support the eaves. Unlike Wind's other plantation homes, Eudora did not include a pediment. It did have other Wind signatures, such as siding set flush under the portico to resemble stone and a cantilever balcony over the front door. This door had an ogee- curved arch. While some elements of the house comply with Greek Revival, the ogee and entablature bracket curves depart from the style. However, Wind's talent is revealed in his ability to harmoniously blend these newer-styled features into the Greek Revival. Eudora was destroyed by fire in 1987.Gleason, p. 124 Circa 1856, John Wind began work on Fair Oaks for Colonel Richard Mitchell, a hero of the War of 1812. Like Oak Lawn, the portico and balcony had projecting center sections. However, the pediment had a triangular window rather than a carved rosette. If the rosette was Wind's usual last signature, it could have been replaced with a window, because Wind died in 1863, perhaps before the house was completed. The entablature was complete, but had no dentil, resembling the Tuscan order. Fourteen-inch square pillars rather than fluted round columns were used. The balcony entablature was deeper than that of the portico, and the balcony pillars were attached by curved dropped sections on the entablature, creating an arch effect between the columns. These elements and the triangular window combine to give a somewhat Oriental touch to the appearance, again illustrating Wind's ability to elegantly abandon the Greek Revival with his own unique style. Fair Oaks burned to the ground in 1962. It was reconstructed with an identical exterior, except a carved acorn and oak leaves replaced the pediment window. Other architectural works =Courthouses= In 1855, Wind was commissioned to construct a new courthouse for Thomas county and work was completed by 1858. A charcoal drawing of the original courthouse, perhaps drawn by Wind, a photograph of the courthouse in 1888 when it was renovated in Italianate style and a modern photograph with the columns enclosed are reproduced in a modern invitation to an open house at the courthouse. Wind was also paid $100 to design the adjacent Brooks County Courthouse. =In-town cottages= Another of Wind's idioms was the in-town cottage. It is somewhat less certain which cottages in Thomasville were Wind designs, an example being the Arthur Wright House on Fletcher street. Very probably, the Augustin Hansell house on Hansell street was a Wind design in the late 1850s. It has a -story portico with a double window in the pediment. Brackets under the pediment cornice and entablature run entirely around the house. Six square pillars rise from the porch to support the pediment. These pillars also serve as the newels of the porch railing of square balusters. It has flush siding under the portico, a Wind feature. Also around the late 1850s, Wind designed the Robert Hardaway House. It is two stories with a one-story porch supported by four square, grooved pillars rising from the porch deck, with a fleur-de-lis design above the plinth and below the capitals. These pillars also serve as newels for the railing. The flat-roofed porch has an entablature with an arched connection to the pillars, and the front window has a mitered casing, both similar to Fair Oaks. Like his plantation houses, Haradaway has a double door with sidelights and a fixed transom. This house also has flush siding under the porch. Notable works A number of his works survive and at least six of these are listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. Works include: *Brooks County Courthouse, Courthouse Sq.

Personal Little is known about John Wind's early life. He was born in Bristol, England, in 1819, and was a graduate of Queens College. His diploma allegedly bore the signature of Queen Victoria, and since she ascended to the throne on June 20, 1837, he could not have arrived in Thomasville prior to 1838. While work began on Greenwood c. 1835, John Wind would only have been 16. It seems unlikely that he would have been trained in England, traveled to New York and arrived in Thomasville by 1835. It is more probable that skilled slaves were bought, the timber was cut for extended drying, and brick manufacture began at Greenwood as early as 1835. A probable date for his arrival in the United States is 1838 or 1839. A letter written by his great- grandson, J. E. Wind, mentions that John Wind's father's name was William and that John had two sisters, Mary Anna and perhaps Suzanna. In 1848, John Wind married Sylvania Bethany Donalson. They had Cornelia (1849), Fuller (1852) and Robert (1856). His son Fuller purchased the Cairo Messenger newspaper in 1904, the same year it was formed. The Messenger remains in the Wind family. In the 1850 census, John Wind was recorded as 31 years old with a wife, two children and two slaves. He lived in a U-shaped cottage on Hawkins street. Half of his cottage was extant before the entire structure was lost. Two medallions of oak leaves of cut tin were set in the gable ends of the house. These were salvaged and reside at Thomasville Landmarks. He was a Mason in the Thomasville Lodge from 1854 to 1858. He died May 18, 1863, not particularly wealthy. A later census recorded Sylvania's net worth at $1000 in real estate and $500 personal property.

Australian National Flag Day is not a public holiday.  Observances and traditions  The idea of an annual day specifically celebrating the Australian National Flag dates from 1984. In that year the New South Wales branch of the Australian National Flag Association (ANFA) arranged for 3 September to be observed as \\"Australian National Flag Day\\" at a public ceremony held in Hyde Park, Sydney. The most consistently held and well attended Flag Day ceremonies have also been staged at various locations in Sydney including Tumbalong Park where the Governor of New South Wales, Sir David Martin, delivered a Flag Day address in 1989 which he said: \\"I come here as someone who is proudly Australian, I come here out of respect for a flag which is proudly Australian\\". The official centenary of federation flag raising event held at the national maritime museum in 2001 would attract a crowd of several thousand Flag Day spectators. On Flag Day 1996 an official ceremony took place during the long running event held at Martin Place Amphitheatre in the centre of Sydney. On that occasion David Jull, Minister for Administrative Services, made a commemorative address reading a message from the Prime Minister, John Howard, welcoming the proclamation of 3 September as Australian National Flag Day. He then presented the ANFA with a copy of the proclamation signed by Sir William Deane. Ceremonies are held annually in schools, other capitals and major provincial centres. Past guests of honour at Flag Day events include the Governor-General, state Governors and members of parliament who along with other dignitaries have also made commemorative messages available to mark the occasion.

It is endemic to Florida in the United States, where it is known only from three counties in the Panhandle.USFWS. E. telephioides Five- year Review. March 2008. It is a federally listed threatened species of the United States.USFWS. Threatened status for three Florida plants. Federal Register May 8, 1992. This spurge grows in coastal areas in Bay, Gulf, and Franklin Counties in Florida. It is present at about 38 known locations, with some locations newly discovered and some recently extirpated. The habitat is scrub and forest where it often grows alongside slash (Pinus elliottii) and longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) or oaks. Much of the area is flatwoods habitat. The soil is sandy. The plant can be common to abundant at many locations, but it is short-lived and can disappear from an area quickly. This is a perennial herb growing up to 30 or 40 centimeters in maximum height. The leaves are lance-shaped to oval and green to red in color, measuring up to 6 centimeters long. They are fleshy and succulent, and the roots are tuberous, helping the plant survive in dry seasons and in sandy soils that retain little water. The species is dioecious, with female plants bearing wider leaves and few flowers and male plants having narrower leaves and many clusters of flowers. The flower is a maroon or red and green cyathium. The fruit is explosively dehiscent, releasing silver, gray, or brown seeds.E. telephioides. The Nature Conservancy. This plant is now found in habitat that is fragmented as the region undergoes development. This part of the Gulf Coast is valuable for conversion to residential communities, and with construction of houses comes construction of roads, utilities, and commercial tracts. Other parts of the region have been consumed for silviculture, particularly pine plantations. The area was formerly a center of pulp wood production. Fire suppression is practiced in plantations and in remaining strips of natural habitat. Flatwoods and other local landscapes have historically been maintained by frequent periodic wildfire, which clears large, dense, tall, and woody vegetation and leaf litter. This allows the spurge and many other smaller plant species of the understory to receive sunlight. The spurge does not tolerate shade or increased ground cover. Its abundance is negatively correlated with the density of the flatwoods. Fire also keeps certain invasive species under control, such as titi (Cyrilla racemiflora). Controlled burns are performed in some areas, and they have a positive effect on this species. It also persists in areas of disturbance in the habitat, such as roadsides.

The first time trial was run in 1895 after a ban on road racing was imposed by the National Cyclists' Union. It wasn't until 1939 that the time trial made its world stage debut as an official stage of the Tour de France.Thompson, p. 44 It was originally used as a method of drawing more people to listen to the Grand Tour on the newly available radio broadcast of the 1939 race. The main thing that distinguished the first time-trial from the traditional form of road racing was that the riders started at intervals instead of one large group and they raced against the clock instead of each other.Sidwells, p. 52 Unlike road racing where the a rider can hang in the peloton and draft off of other riders to conserve energy, time trial races put the rider out alone on the course. There are no breaks and no one to draft off, causing a rider to push as hard as they can the entire raceSloane, p.349. Bicycles have also evolved to accommodate this new form of racing, with most of the breakthroughs occurring in the last 40‚Äì50 years with the introduction of triathlons.  Components of the bike  There are several different aspects of a time trial bike that give the bike its wind cheating ability. * Frame * Component group * Cranks * Wheels * Aerobars * Hydration systems * Helmets * Time-trial clothing  Time-trial vs. road bikes  While both road bikes and time-trial originate from the old bikes used in the Grand Tours, these two classes of bikes have evolved in such a way as to cheat the wind and the clock and retained very few similarities. When the first time-trials were introduced into the Tour de France, little consideration was given to the type of machine the riders would use. The bikes they used for all of the group stages worked just as well as anything that existed during the time period, so that is what was used. Road bikes have existed as competition racing machines for almost 100 years before the earliest modern time-trial/triathlon bike made its debut in the cycling world. The traditional road frame, or diamond frame, which is still used on bicycles today, appeared barely a hundred years ago.Cycling Magazines Bicycle Repair, p. 17 At the time, it was considered one of the most technological advancement. Technology and science together have contributed to the development of today's time-trial machines. The average road bike in the hands of a professional cyclist averages speeds between 20‚Äì28 miles per hour depending on the terrain. Standard road bike with Shimano 105 group Time trial bike. Note the smaller frame, and more aggressive riding position Component groups Every bike is made up of a series of components. The drive-train components are what make the bike go. These consist of the bike chain, front and rear derailleurs, crankset, and bottom bracket. The drive-train is the one part of the bike that doesn't change significantly between road bikes and time-trial bikes. The three main companies that produce component groups are Campagnolo, Shimano, and SRAM. Campagnolo is the oldest of the three, founded in 1933.Factory Tours: Passion Aplenty Miracles? No. (2011, May). Road Bike Action Magazine, 5(3), 54. Component groups are fairly universal on road bikes and time trial bikes. Both use the same group-sets and depending on the rider and the venue of the practice or race, the same gearing might also be used. The cranks are the main component difference between road and time-trial bikes. A standard crank, which is found on road bike, has two chain-rings and a gearing of 53√ó39, which means that the large chain-ring has 53 teeth on it and the little ring has 39 teeth. The teeth grab the chain and propel the bike forward. A standard time-trial crank typically has a gearing of 54√ó42 and has solid chain-rings instead of the hollow metal rings found on road cranks. High end time-trial chain-rings are made from solid carbon fiber with the exception of the teeth. Aerobars Traditional road bikes had drop bars that kept the rider in an upright position which created a lot of drag. The new triathlon bikes still had the drop bars, but they incorporated aerobars onto the handlebar. These new bars allowed the riders to get into a wind cheating position. Aerobars come in two different styles: clip-on systems and integrated systems. Clip-on aerobars attach to any handlebars to give the rider the aero advantage on a tri-bike. Integrated systems mean the aerobars and the basebars are all one system and attached to the bike as one whole piece rather than separate components like a clip-on system. There are a few advantages to this; the main one being that an integrated system allows the rider to get into a much lower position and thus be more aerodynamic.http://triathlon.competitor.com/2010/12/gear-tech/tri-bike- basics‚Äîaerobars_10071 On the down side, these types of systems usually only work on tri bikes unless the owner wants to have their road bike completely overhauled into a tri bike. To get the best aero advantage out of the bars, companies spend countless hours in wind tunnels adjusting the aerobars. Wheels Beside the frame, the wheels are one of the most vital parts of the bike when it comes to performance.Ballantine, P.60 When designing wheels, companies take two major factors into consideration: the weight of the wheel and its shape. The shape of the wheels depends on what its primary use is going to be. Most racing wheels are made with carbon fiber rims and have deeper rims, otherwise known as \\"deep dishes.\\" While these wheels have been proven to increase a rider's power up to 30%, they can also affect the stability of the bike, especially with crosswinds. They also affect the turning radius of the bike and the rider comfort.Flynn, M., Long, E., & Whelan-Curtin, W. (2000). A Systematic Technique For Optimal Bicycle Wheel Selection. The UMAP Journal, 22(3), 241-252. These wheels have deeper rims in order to better deflect the air around the wheel. Traditionally wheels come in two sizes, 650c and 700c. The 650c wheels have the advantage of being smaller and lighter which give them a slight advantage on hills but because they do not do as good of a job displacing weight around the bike they are an option for smaller riders. The 700c wheels are the universal size that is used on almost every bike made today. On the rare occasion, a 650c front wheel is paired with a 700c rear wheel to gain better aerodynamics Comeau, B. (n.d.) From the Field: Wheels. UltraCycling Magazine. Date Retrieved April 2, 2011. Some of the top racing wheels are built by companies like HED, Zipp, DT Swiss, Shimano, Easton, and Reynolds among others. These carbon fiber specialty wheels are typically only used by individuals who intend to compete, partially because the price tag on a given wheelset can run from $1,300 (Sram S60) up to $6,000 (Reynolds RZR 92.2) Deterline, M. (2011, Spring). Wheels Buyers Guide. Triathlete's Buyers Guide: Best of 2011, 112‚Äì124. Specialized hydration systems Hydration is a major part of an athlete's daily life. It is essential for their success both during practice and while competing. As bike technology has evolved, so has the technology for re-fueling the athlete. On a traditional road bike, which has a standard triangular frame, there is more than enough room for two large water-bottles. At most, modern time-trial bikes will hold one water bottle within the frame. High-end time-trial bikes do not have attachments for water bottles within the frame. This lack of water bottle attachments and the need to keep the aero-position throughout a race has not surprisingly led to the development of aero-hydration systems. Due to this lack of water-bottle storage, there are two main types of aero-hydration systems; behind the saddle (seat) and between the aero-bars. Rear-mounted hydration systems attach to the rail on the saddle and are positioned to smooth the air flow over the rider. These types of systems can either consist of a simple seat-mounted water bottle holder that typically holds two water bottles, or a seat-mounted bladder with a drinking tube running along the frame up to the rider. Front-mounted hydration systems have aero properties similar to those of a rear-mounted system, to create as little wind resistance as possible. A front-mounted system is almost always tucked between the aerobars. The most commonly used type of front-mounted hydration system is a water bottle that tucks between the aerobars with a straw that extends up to the rider but can be folded out of the way when not in use. Aero savings Time-trial bikes provide a significant aerodynamic advantage over standard road bikes. If a rider averages 75‚Äì80 minutes to complete a 40 km course on a road bike, using a traditional metal frame, shallow rimmed wheels, and standard road bike components, including a down-tube mounted water-bottle, then switching these road components to the aerodynamic counterparts could shave the following times off their total ride. Positioning Pro and elite level cyclists turn to the wind-tunnels to constantly seek refinement and improvements in their individual time trial on-the-bike positioning. Professionally measured, out-on-the-road tested positioning (arms inwards as much as physiologically possible, knees in pedalling, head and body in better alignment in the time trialing, aero position, etc.) will see as much as a 6-minutes improvement in non-aero or former poor aero positioning. Empirical evidence shows that it is far more important to aerodynamically improve a rider's position than to rely solely on technology in order to better one's time trialing results. Aerobars These will bring the rider forward and drop you into an aero tuck with a flatter back and narrow elbows. Time saved: 3‚Äì5 minutes. Better ride Knowing one's physical capabilities and the course will mean one can ride the 40 km in the quickest way possible. Time saved: 1‚Äì3 mins. Aero helmet Smooth airflow reduces drag around a significant object, namely the head. Time saved: up to 1 min. Aero drinking bottle Allows hands- free hydration, reducing drag as there is no arm movement to interfere with airflow. Time saved: 30‚Äì45 secs.

Tri suit Skin-tight Lycra has demonstrated 6% improvements in research. Time saved 30‚Äì45 secs (and quicker transitions). Aero wheels A 50-80 mm deep aero front wheel and disc is the ultimate set-up but it‚Äôs a costly way to get faster. Time saved: 1‚Äì2 mins. Lightweight aero frame Most of the gain is due to the aero position it allows, but the weight loss also helps a little. Time saved: 1‚Äì1:30 mins. High-quality tires These reduce frontal area and rolling resistance, significant for riders with lower power output. Time saved: 2‚Äì4 mins.

Back in his room Benny finds ¬£32 in the wallet, but also a letter from Mannering to Caroline, which makes it clear that he is having an affair with her and that his wife must not find out. He decides to blackmail the couple, and Mannering agrees to pay him as he does not want any scandal as he is trying to get voted onto the Council of the Royal College of Surgeons. Mannering agrees to meet Benny and pay ¬£200 for the letter, but finds that he has been cheated and does not get the letter back. Benny spends some of the money on a watch for Molly, which he says cost him ¬£60. He then rings up Mannering again, this time asking for ¬£300, but as he goes to the meeting he buys a gun. When he meets Mannering they swap the money and the letter, but Benny tells Mannering, falsely, that he took a photo of the letter and has the negative, suggesting that he intends to continue blackmailing Mannering. The latter grabs hold of Benny, but in the ensuing struggle Benny shoots Mannering dead. The police investigation soon leads them first to Caroline, and then George, the barman at the Flamingo, who identifies Benny from police files. They go to Benny's address but he manages to escape and goes to a crook, Rocco, to try and get out of the country. Rocco however wants ¬£400, so Benny decides to ask Molly to give him back the watch so that he can raise the money. By chance however Caroline makes an appointment at the hairdressers where Molly works, and inadvertently Molly makes Caroline realise that it was her with Benny in the Flamingo that evening; she then hears a conversation between Molly and Benny on the phone, arranging a meeting at a railway bridge that evening. She tells the police, who are waiting for Benny when he turns up; he tries to escape by scrambling over the bridge but falls to his death on the tracks below.

Reception The Monthly Film Bulletin said the story \\"has action and movement but is not, as a whole, particularly competent.\\"WIDE BOY Monthly Film Bulletin; London Vol. 19, Iss. 216, (Jan 1, 1952): 82. BFI Screenoline said Hughes \\"displays a keen awareness of class differences and, although opportunities for character development are strictly limited by the film's brief running time, he manages to avoid caricature and sketches a series of contrasting milieus with the authenticity brought by the careful observation of detail. Hughes also takes the trouble to make sure that, while conventional morality is upheld, we retain some shred of sympathy for his wide boy.:Wide Box at BFI Screenonline The Independent wrote that the film \\"rarely features on the official list of 'great British films of 1952' but it does boast a winning performance from Sidney Tafler in the title role amid a bomb- ravaged London of quite amazing shoddiness.\\"FILM: Attack of the B-movie ; Cheap, low-quality, second features were a cinema staple until TV killed them.

Radio The radio play was meant to be broadcast on the BBC in early 1952 but this was delayed due to concerns by the BBC about its subject matter. It was adapted for Australian radio in 1953. The cast included Ray Barrett. There were later productions in 1956. Short Story Rienits adapted the story as a short story. It was published in his novel Assassin for Hire. Remake The story was adapted for Australian TV in the TV play Bodgie (1959), where it was relocated to an Australian setting.\\"Bodgies in Drama\\", Sydney Morning Herald, 10 August 1959 p 13 References External links Wide Boy at Letterbox DVD *Wide Boy at BFI Screenonline *Wide Boy at BFI 1952 films British films British crime films English- language films Films directed by Ken Hughes ","title":"Wide Boy (film)"},{"id":"31261337","title":"Alfaguara Prize"},{"id":"31261355","text":"Sk√∫tusta√∞ahreppur is a rural municipality located in East Iceland, in Northeastern Region.

Design and development Bates developed his first aircraft, a piloted kite in 1898 at the age of 14 at Clear Lake, Iowa. Later as a student of Octave Chanute, he developed his own biplane in 1908 with a similar design as a Curtiss biplane. Bates raced a modified Buick at Daytona with this tricycle gear aircraft. In 1911 he started on an all original design of his own, including a lightweight engine. The monoplane was built using a wooden fuselage, with a fabric covered oval steel tube tail section. Bates developed his own engine for the aircraft that was also used on the Steinhous tandem biplane, and the Charles A. Hibbard monoplane of the same period. Operational history Bates tested and flew his designs at Cicero Field before the airport officially opened. His monoplane demonstrated, and crashed on the same day when the field opened on 4 July 1911. The aircraft was later rebuilt with a 3-cylinder Poyer engine by Heath. In 1912 Bates Aeroplane company was sold to Heath Aircraft Company. An example of a 1912 Bates monoplane is in the EAA Airventure Museum in Oshkosh, Wisconsin It was purchased in 1918 and stored in a barn until its restoration in 1957.

The site is situated on Nuvagapak Point, about northeast of the topographical Demarcation Bay and from the border with Canada. Situated east of Point Barrow, it was the most remote DEW site in Alaska. Demarcation Bay DEW Line Station was closed in 1964, and is not open for public use. History The station was built in 1957 to support the Distant Early Warning Line. Designated BAR-A, it was classified as an \\"Intermediate Site\\". Intermediate sites were small, consisting of usually one or two buildings, and AN/FPS-23 Doppler radar systems, which transmitted CW signals to the adjacent Main or Auxiliary stations. Low flying aircraft trying to penetrate the DEWLine would be detected by a Doppler shift at the adjacent receiving station and thus signal an alarm which indicated an intrusion was in progress. The system was so sensitive that often flocks of birds would trigger false alarms. BAR-A had a permanent 1500‚Äô gravel airstrip for support. In the winter, a 5000‚Äô ice runway was laid out across the bay when the sea ice exceeded 6‚Äô in thickness. The ice runway could accommodate larger aircraft, such as the DC-3, to provide necessary supplies. Demarcation Bay was logistically supported by the Barter Island BAR-MAIN DEW Line Station, but was operated by civilian contract workers. Along with the other intermediate DEW Line Sites, Demarcation Bay Station was closed in 1963 after developments in radar technology rendered it obsolete. It has been abandoned ever since. The radars and other military buildings were removed around 2000, returning the site to a relatively natural condition. The gravel streets and the runway of the former airstrip of the station remain.

The band is currently based in Toronto, Ontario. The band's debut LP Strike Hard, Young Diamond was favourably received by both Exclaim! and Chart.  History  =Formation= Band members Dean Povinsky, Graham Plant and Dwayne Christie are originally from Oshawa, Ontario. Wildlife began as an entity in 2005, when singer/guitarist Povinsky and guitarist Darryl Smith left Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario and moved to Glasgow to form and play in a band. The group, also comprising Scottish drummer Peter Kelly and Canadian Billy Holmes, spent time travelling, writing songs, recording and playing small venues around Glasgow. The dark days, rain, and a general homesickness led the members to abandon the project and return to Canada. Povinsky moved to Toronto with the intention of continuing Wildlife with childhood friend Graham Plant on guitar, drummer Dwayne Christie and Julia Mensink playing synthesizer. The group was rounded out when bassist Derek Bosomworth was procured via a Craigslist advertisement. The band is currently based in Toronto, Ontario. = EP = The group independently released a self-titled EP in November 2008. Copies were sold at shows and on tours of Ontario and eastern Canada. The recording is currently out of print. = Strike Hard, Young Diamond = Wildlife released Strike Hard, Young Diamond 16 November 2010 on the Toronto- based independent label Easy Tiger Music. Recorded and mixed in Hamilton, Ontario, their full-length debut was reviewed positively on the Baeble Music website. Critic Jessica Lewis of Exclaim! wrote, \\"The five songs are bold, full of angst and to the point, but they're also filled with youthful exuberance and affirming righteousness that will be good for a simple pick-me- up.\\" In a favourable review, critic Scott Bryson of Chart suggested that the band's style was like a mix of fellow Canadians Wolf Parade and Born Ruffians. Wildlife's song \\"Sea Dreamer\\" debuted on CBC Radio 3s top 30 charts at No. 28 and rose to No. 4. Wildlife played the Canadian Music Week festival in 2011. In an early leak of the Arcade Fire album The Suburbs, some tracks by Wildlife were released along with the leak, replacing \\"Rococo\\" by Arcade fire with \\"Sea Dreamer\\", among other replacements. Band members cite their musical influences as including Bruce Springsteen, David Bowie, and The Clash. = On the Heart = Wildlife released \\"On the Heart\\" in March 2013 through Wax Records.

History For random matrices with Gaussian distribution of entries (the Ginibre ensembles), the circular law was established in the 1960s by Jean Ginibre. In the 1980s, Vyacheslav Girko introduced an approach which allowed to establish the circular law for more general distributions. Further progress was made by Zhidong Bai, who established the circular law under certain smoothness assumptions on the distribution. The assumptions were further relaxed in the works of Terence Tao and Van H. Vu, Guangming Pan and Wang Zhou, and Friedrich G√∂tze and Alexander Tikhomirov. Finally, in 2010 Tao and Vu proved the circular law under the minimal assumptions stated above. The circular law result was extended in 1988 by Sommers, Crisanti, Sompolinsky and Stein to an elliptical law for ensembles of matrices with arbitrary correlations. The elliptic and circular laws were further generalized by Aceituno, Rogers and Schomerus to the hypotrochoid law which includes higher order correlations.

He undertook several irrigation works which included the masonry dam of Mullaperiyar on the Periyar River.  Early life  Pennycuick was born on 15 January 1841 at Pune, a younger son of Brigadier-General John Pennycuick and his wife Sarah. His father and eldest brother, Alexander, fought and died at the Battle of Chillianwalla in 1849. He was educated at Cheltenham College.  Career  Pennycuick entered the East India Company Military College at Addiscombe, Surrey, in 1857, and was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Madras Engineer Group in December 1858.The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser (1884-1942), 12 April 1911, Page 2 He arrived in India on 11 November 1860. He became a Second Captain on 15 October 1870;London Gazette, 4 November 1870:4734 and a major on 8 December 1876.London Gazette, 29 December 1876:7144 He commanded H company at Zoulla during the Abyssinian campaign of 1868.London Gazette, 30 June 1868:3676 On 10 October 1895 the Queen nominated him a Companion of the Order of the Star of India.London Gazette, 11 October 1895:5585 He served in the Public Works Department till January 1896. During his six years of service in the PWD, Pennycuick served as Chief Engineer in the construction of the Mullaperiyar Dam and was awarded a medal for his participation in Abyssinian Expedition of 1867-68. Pennycuick was nominated to the Madras Legislative Council in November 1893. He was the last president of the Royal Indian Engineering College at Coopers Hill. He also held the position of President of the Sanitary Board and was a faculty in the University of Madras. He received a Telford medal from the Institution of Civil Engineers. The Australian government sought his advice for avoiding damage from flooding of the Brisbane river in 1899. He was also a keen cricketer.  Mullai periyar Dam  Colonel Pennycuick decided to divert the west-flowing Periyar (river)'s culmination in the Arabian Sea towards the East so that it could irrigate lakhs of acres of dry land depending only on Vaigai river. Though Pennycuick and other British Engineers went ahead with the construction, braving the nature's fury and the dangers of poisonous insects and wild animals, the construction works were disrupted by relentless rain. Large number of sand bags kept for the construction of the dam was destroyed due to severe flood. A popular myth is that since he could not get adequate funds from the British government, Pennycuick went to England and sold his family property to mobilise money to fund the project - however, there is no evidence to thisas stated by his grandson himself,https://www.livemint.com/Sundayapp/3PeedgK5bx4Z9uPKEE0KPL/John- Pennycuick-The-man-who-built-the-Mullaiperiyar-dam.html which was completed in 1895. The dam was inaugurated by Lord Wenlock, the then Governor of the Madras Presidency. It resulted in irrigation of 2.23 lakh acres in Theni, Dindigul, Madurai, Sivaganga and Ramanathapuram districts. Pennycuick used lime and surki paste for construction, taking into consideration the gravitational force: this allows the dam to withstand tremors and remain strong. Pennycuick said: \\"I am going to be only once in this earthly world, hence I need to do some good deeds here. This deed should not be prorogue nor ignored since I am not going to be here again\\".'Kumudam' Tamil weekly magazine Death Pennycuick died in Camberley, Surrey, on 9 March 1911. He is buried in the Churchyard of St. Peter's Church in Frimley. The grave has a substantial granite cross and plinth. In 2018 the grave was renovated and a large granite plaque was added in commemoration of his work on the Mullaiperiyar Dam. The plaque is from the States of Tamilnadu and Kerala in recognition of the achievement.  Family  Pennycuick married Grace Georgina Chamier in 1879.

As in the field of cavity quantum electrodynamics, a single photon within a single mode cavity coherently couples to a quantum object (atom). In contrast to cavity QED, the photon is stored in a one-dimensional on-chip resonator and the quantum object is no natural atom but an artificial one. These artificial atoms usually are mesoscopic devices which exhibit an atom-like energy spectrum. The field of circuit QED is a prominent example for quantum information processing and a promising candidate for future quantum computation. In the late 2010s decade, experiments involving cQED in 3 dimensions have demonstrated deterministic gate teleportation and other operations on multiple qubits.  Resonator  The resonant devices used for circuit QED are superconducting coplanar waveguide microwave resonators, which are two-dimensional microwave analogues of the Fabry‚ÄìP√©rot interferometer. Coplanar waveguides consist of a signal carrying centerline flanked by two grounded planes. This planar structure is put on a dielectric substrate by a photolithographic process. Superconducting materials used are mostly aluminium (Al) or niobium (Nb). Dielectrics typically used as substrates are either surface oxidized silicon (Si) or sapphire (Al2O3). The line impedance is given by the geometric properties, which are chosen to match the 50 Omega of the peripheric microwave equipment to avoid partial reflection of the signal. The electric field is basically confined between the center conductor and the ground planes resulting in a very small mode volume V_m which gives rise to very high electric fields per photon E_0 (compared to three-dimensional cavities). Mathematically, the field E_0 can be found as E_0=sqrt{frac{hbaromega_r}{2 varepsilon_0 V_m}}, where hbar is the reduced Planck constant, omega_r is the angular frequency, and varepsilon_0 is the permittivity of free space. One can distinguish between two different types of resonators: lambda/2 and lambda/4 resonators. Half-wavelength resonators are made by breaking the center conductor at two spots with the distance ell. The resulting piece of center conductor is in this way capacitively coupled to the input and output and represents a resonator with E-field antinodes at its ends. Quarter-wavelength resonators are short pieces of a coplanar line, which are shorted to ground on one end and capacitively coupled to a feed line on the other. The resonance frequencies are given by lambda/2: quad u_n=frac{c}{sqrt{varepsilon_{text{eff}}}}frac{n}{2 ell} quad (n=1,2,3,ldots) qquad lambda/4:quad u_n=frac{c}{sqrt{varepsilon_{text{eff}}}}frac{2n+1}{4 ell} quad (n=0,1,2,ldots) with varepsilon_{text{eff}} being the effective dielectric permittivity of the device.  Artificial atoms, Qubits  The first realized artificial atom in circuit QED was the so-called Cooper-pair box, also known as the charge qubit. In this device, a reservoir of Cooper pairs is coupled via Josephson junctions to a gated superconducting island. The state of the Cooper-pair box (qubit) is given by the number of Cooper pairs on the island (N Cooper pairs for the ground state mid g rangle and N+1 for the excited state mid e rangle). By controlling the Coulomb energy (bias voltage) and the Josephson energy (flux bias) the transition frequency omega_a is tuned. Due to the nonlinearity of the Josephson junctions the Cooper-pair box shows an atom like energy spectrum. Other more recent examples for qubits used in circuit QED are so called transmon qubits (more charge noise insensitive compared to the Cooper-pair box) and flux qubits (whose state is given by the direction of a supercurrent in a superconducting loop intersected by Josephson junctions). All of these devices feature very large dipole moments d (up to 103 times that of large n Rydberg atoms), which qualifies them as extremely suitable coupling counterparts for the light field in circuit QED.  Theory  The full quantum description of matter-light interaction is given by the Jaynes‚ÄìCummings model. The three terms of the Jaynes‚ÄìCummings model can be ascribed to a cavity term, which is mimicked by a harmonic oscillator, an atomic term and an interaction term. mathcal{H}_{text{JC}}=underbrace{hbar omega_r left(a^dagger a+frac 12right)}_{text{cavity term}}+underbrace{frac 12 hbar omega_a sigma_z}_{text{atomic term}}+underbrace{hbar g left(sigma_+ a+a^dagger sigma_-right)}_{text{interaction term}} In this formulation omega_r is the resonance frequency of the cavity and a^dagger and a are photon creation and annihilation operators, respectively. The atomic term is given by the Hamiltonian of a spin-¬Ω system with omega_a being the transition frequency and sigma_z the Pauli matrix. The operators sigma_pm are raising and lowering operators (ladder operators) for the atomic states. For the case of zero detuning (omega_r=omega_a) the interaction lifts the degeneracy of the photon number state mid n rangle and the atomic states mid g rangle and mid e rangle and pairs of dressed states are formed. These new states are superpositions of cavity and atom states mid n,pm rangle=frac 1{sqrt 2}left(mid grangle mid n ranglepm mid erangle mid n-1rangleright) and are energetically split by 2gsqrt n. If the detuning is significantly larger than the combined cavity and atomic linewidth the cavity states are merely shifted by pm g^2/Delta (with the detuning Delta=omega_a-omega_r) depending on the atomic state. This provides the possibility to read out the atomic (qubit) state by measuring the transition frequency. The coupling is given by g=E cdot d (for electric dipolar coupling). If the coupling is much larger than the cavity loss rate kappa=frac{omega_r}Q (quality factor Q; the higher Q, the longer the photon remains inside the resonator) as well as the decoherence rate gamma (rate at which the qubit relaxes into modes other than the resonator mode) the strong coupling regime is reached. Due to the high fields and low losses of the coplanar resonators together with the large dipole moments and long decoherence times of the qubits, the strong coupling regime can easily be reached in the field of circuit QED. Combination of the Jaynes‚ÄìCummings model and the coupled cavities leads to the Jaynes‚ÄìCummings‚ÄìHubbard model.

The revolt of the Cruel Fat Thursday ('Crudel zobia grassa' in Venetian used by Gregorio Amaseo, 'Crudel joibe grasse' in modern Friulan) was a revolt (or jacquerie) that broke out on Fat Thursday in 1511 in Friuli in Northeast Italy. Background =The discontent in Friuli near the beginning of the 16th century= After less than a century of Venetian occupation of the land of Friuli the discontent caused by heavy privileges practiced by the clergy and nobility started spreading out among the population; to worsen the situation the noble families were in constant war between themselves, which caused an increase of taxes, devastation of territory, and a necessity to serve in the master's army. By the 16th-century, the Venetian Republic had never granted Friuli the same status as the other mainland domains (domini di terra), but considered the territory important as a buffer against the Ottoman armies. The second class status of the region was reflected in a paucity of investments in the mainly rural region for social and economical development. That led to an isolation of the region in cultural and linguistic terms from Venice, and the absence of any communal governance structures. This exasperated the discontent of the peasant communities in this still mainly feudal rural area. To this situation, the local nobility, deprived of its former power by the government of Venice, tried to maintain its social status by exploiting their remaining rights and demanding services from the peasants. =The first popular uprisings= The first tumults began as early as 1509 when a crowd of armed peasants took possession of the castle in Sterpo, chased out the inhabitants, and set it on fire. That was the last act of a clash that had been dragged on for some time now between the inhabitants of Virco, Flambro, and Sivigliano against the aristocratic Colloredo family, the owners of the castle, accused of usurping the community's pastures and woods for their own advantage. It was the event that raised the public opinion since for various years all the region was shaken by disputes and skirmishes stirred up by the peasants against the nobility, their families, soldiers, servants, or their representatives (clashes occurred with Spilimbergo, Maniago, Valvasone, Portogruaro, Colloredo, Tarcento). In 1510, a group of Friulan noblemen was returning from Venice where they had asked greater protection against the disorders. They were intercepted and chased away by a group of armed peasants at the height of Zompicchia (the ambush of Malazumpicchia). =Coalitions on the eve of Fat Thursday 1511= The Savorgnan, an aristocratic family of Udine, who had been declared Filovenetian, took advantage of the disorders for personal gain. Their politics was based on a patronage system sistema clientelare that tied them directly to the population. They granted within their jurisdictions rights to the peasants or conferred old customs of lands exploitation as such. In case of crop failure, they opened their stores to the starving population, provided loans, listened to the neighborhood vicinie representatives' opinion. This protection system intentionally created a real clan, whose members became known as \\"zamberlani\\", who were identified with the charismatic figure of Antonio Savorgnan, so close the Venetian rulers as to be nominated general commander of the cernide, the armed peasants' militias (called up in case of war). This faction was opposed by the \\"strumieri\\" who took possession of a great part of the old Friulan nobility that could not tolerate the Serenissima members attempts to hold on to their powers; at the head of them were the members of the della Torre family, sworn enemies of the Savorgnan family since 1339. The strumieri gained the support of the anti- Venetian Habsburg Monarchy. Outbreak of Fat Thursday revolt On 27 February 1511, on \\"Fat Thursday\\", Antonio Savorgnan staged an imperial attack on Udine, using the cividalesi soldiers led by his nephew Alvise da Porto, and calling the people to defend the city. In the midst of the chaos caused by the failing attack, Savorgnan instigated the plunder of the della Torre properties. Followed by a wave of a lust for looting, a plunder of those of all the delle dimore udinian nobility (except for the Savorgnan palace, the real headquarters of the revolution). Many members of the della Torre, Colloredo, della Frattina, Soldonieri, Gorgo, Bertolini families and others were murdered, their bodies were stripped and abandoned in the streets of the downtown, or dragged through the mud and then thrown in nearby cemeteries. Then the rebels put on the nobles' clothes, staging a macabre masquerade and imitating the ways of the original owners, actually embodying the spirit of \\"inversion of roles\\" typical of a carnival. The noblemen who escaped retreated to their castles, or way beyond Tagliamento, in the western Friuli. At that point, Antonio Savorgnan's plan concluded, and while he remained officially unlinked to the riots, it had succeeded in eliminating many of his rival family leaders. To avoid a betrayal he murdered two of his armed men who knew of his implications and dumped the bodies, together with that of a third witness, in the Well of St John. Revolt suppressed Only a few days later an armed contingent from Gradisca arrived and managed to restore the public order, but it didn't stop the carnival procession focused on mocking the murdered nobility. Meanwhile, the trail of violence spread over the territories bordering Udine and gradually all over the region. The villages' inhabitants, most of them peasants, armed as if for a war, besieged the castles inhabited by the nobility: Those of Spilimbergo, Valvasone, Cusano, and Salvarolo e Zoppola were taken by force. The 'strumieri' troops reorganized close to the castle di Giulio di Porcia, gaining the support of the men of Venetian ruler of Pordenone, of some Sacilians and of about 800 inhabitants of the Concordia Sagittaria zone. The decisive clash took place close to the river Cellina, were the cavalry (circa 70 horsemen) and the best trained 'strumieri' defeated their enemies. As a warning, Giulio hanged one of the rebels' leaders close to the Castle of Zoppola, forcing prisoners to help with the scene. On 26 March of the same year, a violent earthquake devastated Udine and the entire region, causing a few thousands casualties. Later on the same territories were scourged by the plague: these tragic events were interpreted by contemporaries as a tangible sign of divine justice. Epilogue Piazza Venerio and the church of San Francesco. Ill lit marble indicates the planimetry of the Antonio Savorgnan palace, demolished in 1549 The Venetian government established a special tribunal that condemned to death the main exponents of the revolt, but failed to adjudicate the real author, Antonio Savorgnan who, given the overall negative outcome, paradoxically found shelter among the imperialists' ranks which he had so long opposed to, in Villach, on an Austrian territory. Yet the revenge was not late to come since a strumieri conspiracy organized his assassination that happened on 27 March 1512 at the exit from the Villaco cathedral by Spilimbergo's and Colloredo's noblemen's hand. The governor of Venice confiscated his assets in 1549 and destroyed the Savorgnan palace in Udine leaving its ruins as a warning in what was called place de ruvine (\\"square of the ruin\\" in Friulan language, or \\"piazza della rovina\\" in Italian; now \\"Venerio Square\\", after the Udinese metereologist Gerolamo Venerio). Yet Savorgnan death didn't put an end to both the revenge and the retaliation triggered by the Thursday of abundance's events that lost by now the revolt's collective dimension and acquired the feudalism and the settlement of personal accounts' character. The last duel connected to these events happened in 1567 between a nobleman of Arcano and one of Savorgnan. The great mass of peasants who had participated in the revolt returned to their work in the fields in the same conditions as before, but the governor of Serenissima decided to anticipate possible new revolts made some efforts towards the zamberlans' requests and therefore setting a peasantry organization, compounded of peasants' representatives who could put veto on the proposals of the Parliament.

The team fielded the No. 6 Chevrolet Silverado for Justin Lofton and various other drivers and the No. 8 Chevrolet for Max Gresham. History =ARCA= The team was formed by former driver and crew chief Eddie Sharp in 2005, who had formerly fielded his own ASA team and was the crew chief for Bill Baird during his championship- winning 1999 ARCA season. The team made its debut in 2006 with former Grand-Am driver Michael McDowell running a limited schedule. McDowell and Sharp ran full-time in 2007, running the No. 2 Make-A-Wish Foundation Dodge. McDowell grabbed four wins in his rookie season but finished second in the championship to Frank Kimmel. ESR also fielded the No. 22 Dodge, with Josh Wise and Ken Butler III sharing the ride, with Butler winning at Toledo Speedway. With McDowell moving on to Michael Waltrip Racing, Sharp expanded to three teams and switched to running Toyotas, hiring former Scuderia Toro Rosso Formula 1 driver Scott Speed to drive the No. 2, while retaining Butler for the full season and fielding a third car (No. 93) in a number of races for Canadian NASCAR driver Pierre Bourque. The team soon changed numbers to the No. 20 with Justin Lofton for the rest of the year. ESR dominated the season, with Speed winning four races en route to a second-place finish in the championship and Lofton won at Michigan. With Speed heading to the Sprint Cup Series, ESR gained a reputation of fielding championship-caliber drivers. In 2009, Lofton stayed on with ESR for the full season as the team expanded to a fourth car, the No. 81 for Camping World Series East driver Craig Goess. The No. 2 would be driven by another Grand-Am driver, Tim George Jr., and the No. 20 would be driven by Canadian Steve Arpin on a part-time basis. Lofton won ESR's first ever championship that season, grabbing an impressive four wins, while Goess and Arpin impressed many. Like his predecessors, Lofton moved to Red Horse Racing to run for the Camping World Truck Series title in 2010, while Goess returned for the full season. ESR ran only Goess' 81 for the full season, while continuing to field the 6 for a bevy of drivers, including another former F1 driver, Nelson Piquet, Jr., Blake Koch, Brandon McReynolds (son of Fox broadcaster Larry McReynolds), and others. Goess had a solid season, winning only once at Pocono but finishing second in points to Patrick Sheltra. =NASCAR Truck Series= 2006: Woodard & Sharp Racing ESR made its first foray into NASCAR in 2006, when he partnered with co-owner Rick Woodard to field a full-time Truck Series team that year with former Hendrick Motorsports development driver Boston Reid running full-time in the No. 25. Woodard did not join Sharp's existing ARCA team as a co-owner, and their Truck team was operated separately from it. After the first four races of the season, Sharp left WSR, leaving Woodard as the team's only owner. Reid would be replaced by ARCA driver Damon Lusk as the team's driver with five races to go in the season. Although the team supposedly was preparing to return for at least the Daytona season-opener, Woodard Racing closed down before the start of the 2007 season. 2010: Sharp-Hartman Racing Sharp would not be an owner in the Truck Series again until 2010, where he returned to the series with another co-owner, Carl Hartman, to field a No. 41 Toyota Tundra for Steve Park in two events. 2010‚Äì2013: Eddie Sharp Racing Late in the season, ESR had purchased the assets of Team Gill Racing No. 46 and had intended to run Craig Goess for Rookie of the Year in 2011. After only 9 races, Goess was released from the team and Sharp was reunited with Lofton, who had sponsorship from CollegeComplete.com and a new crew chief in Daniel Bormann. For 2012, Eddie Sharp purchased the spun-off assets of Kevin Harvick Incorporated that were not acquired in the race team's merger with Richard Childress Racing, specifically the 8 and 33 trucks driven by Piquet and Ron Hornaday. Cale Gale drove the 33 in 2012 with sponsorship from Rheem, and a technical alliance with Childress. The 8 truck was driven by Mike Skinner at Daytona, but he wrecked early alongside Gale. In Martinsville, Eddie Sharp sold the No. 8 Truck's owners points to Jennifer Jo Cobb, who swapped manufacturers and numbers (Cobb had the No. 8 as a Dodge, while Chris Lafferty drove the No. 10 Chevrolet). Sharp then gave the owners points to Cobb for the rest of 2012 in order to allow the truck to eventually be used part-time if a third driver was necessary. On May 18, 2012, Justin Lofton won his first race in the No. 6 truck. Gale would win the season finale at Homestead in a photo finish. The team's No. 6 truck in a partnership with Young's Motorsports, driven by Tyler Young, at Rockingham Speedway in 2013 For 2013, Lofton would reduce his schedule to only a few races, while Gale and Rheem departed for Turner Scott Motorsports. Max Gresham would run the full schedule for the team, with Truck Series veteran crew chief Gary Showalter. 2013: Sharp Gallaher Racing In August of that year, Eddie Sharp announced a partnership with California businessman Bill Gallaher, changing the team name to Sharp Gallaher Racing. Soon after this, it was also announced that the team would relocate from Denver, North Carolina to the stock car racing hotbed of Mooresville, North Carolina. On December 17, 2013, reports arose that the team had shut down with immediate effect until later in the day when it was confirmed that the team had shut down with the remaining staff being laid off.

In 2008, a new management structure was established. B√§rbel Dieckmann, who was at that time the mayor of Bonn, became Welthungerhilfe's President in November 2008; her deputy is Joachim von Braun, Director of the Center for Development Research (ZEF) at the University of Bonn. Her predecessor as Chairperson was Ingeborg Sch√§uble, who held the position for twelve years. In organisational terms the registered association is managed by an honorary Supervisory Board of seven members which appoints a three-member executive Board of Directors. Since May 2015, Till Wahnbaeck has been Secretary General.  Funding  Despite a rapid increase in the amount of private donations from the general public (2016: 44.7 million euros), Welthungerhilfe continues to finance the majority of its work from institutional grants (2016: 213.4 million euros). The largest institutional donor organisations are the United Nations' World Food Programme (WFP), the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ), the Deutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ), the EU Commission and the German Federal Foreign Office (AA). In addition to those principal sources, income is received through ‚ÄòFoundation Welthungerhilfe‚Äô (2016: 0.8 million euros) and \\"Interest and other income\\" (2016: 2.2 million euros). In 2016, Welthungerhilfe spent 4.9% of its income on administration, a further 9.7% was spent on advertising and public relations. Activities  As well as direct disaster aid, Welthungerhilfe mainly provides support for people in developing countries in the fields of rural development and food security. Projects to restore basic infrastructure (schools, roads, etc.) to improve social integration and education and to strengthen civil society and health care are also carried out. In Germany and Europe, Welthungerhilfe is working together with other organisations to scrutinize current development policies and to campaign the relevant government bodies. In 2016, 17 projects in Germany helped raise awareness of global problems among the German and European public and political bodies. Together with the children's charity, terre des hommes, Welthungerhilfe regularly publishes the Report on the Reality of Development Aid.[6] Welthungerhilfe is a member of VENRO, the Association of German Development and Humanitarian Aid NGOs. Together with the Alliance2015 network, an association of seven European aid organisations, it carries out political lobbying work at European level. It also promotes the appropriate debate of development politics topics in school lessons by providing teaching material, and offers a range of participative campaigns. Volunteer supporters assist Welthungerhilfe with fundraising events.

It is not open for public use. History The site was built in 1957 to support the Distant Early Warning Line radar station at Point Lay (LIZ-2). The station was logistically supported by the Point Barrow Main DEW Line Station (POW-MAIN). It was operated by civilian contract workers. DEW Line operations ceased in April 1995, and the personnel were relieved from their duties. The radar station was upgraded with new radars and in 1994 was re- designated part of the North Warning System (NWS) as a Short Range Radar Site, A-20, equipped with a minimally attended AN/FPS-124 surveillance radar. In 1998, Pacific Air Forces initiated \\"Operation Clean Sweep\\", in which abandoned Cold War stations in Alaska were remediated and the land restored to its previous state. The site remediation of the radar and support station was carried out by the 611th Civil Engineering Squadron at Elmendorf AFB, and remediation work was completed by 2005. The site was closed in 2007 due to soil erosion and budget concerns. The support airport's status is presently undetermined.

It is located on the B5068 road between Ellesmere and St Martin's and is part of Ellesmere Rural civil parish. The Wales-England border is just to the north. Activities The village has a village hall which hosts regular events such as coffee mornings, open days and other fund raising activities. These are arranged by the Events Committee. There are also regular user groups such as the Women's Institute, senior citizens and bingo as well as card playing groups. There is also a franchised pub called the 'Parish Pump'. The hall possesses facilities for snooker, tennis and crown green bowls, as well as having a football pitch and beautiful allotments which are an asset to the community. The Parish Pump pub and hall have in the past played host to a small country music festival and a village fete. The village has a football team of the same name which plays in Shrewsbury Sunday League. Industry The village consists of a local post office (now situated inside the Parish Hall), and a working men's club, in addition to the Parish Hall. The main source of income in the area is farming which provides jobs for many people of the local area. The reason for the high amount of farming is that the majority of land in the area is taken up by fields and the high clay content in the ground provides minerals for the growth of crops. Others from the community commute to nearby towns such as Ellesmere, Oswestry or Shrewsbury as the village is served by the 53 bus route stopping outside the Parish Hall. Education The village also has a primary school, which has been expanded over the years. Many of its pupils then go on to Lakelands Academy in Ellesmere travelling on the 53 bus. Notable people * The family of Charles de Gaulle, (1890-1970), lived in the village at Gadlas Hall (now a residential care home) during their exile from France in World War II. They rented the house between August 1940 and autumn of 1941, from its owner, judge Francis Taylor, 1st Baron Maenan.The village is named as Criftins. * British showjumper, Nick Skelton, born 1957, owned stables in the area.

Mount Buller Ski Resort The ski area around the town has a network of 22 lifts, capable of moving more than 40,000 people per hour - the highest capacity in Victoria. The highest lifted point is 1780 m at Grimus Chairlift and the base altitude is 1375 m at the Chalet Creek loading station on the Northside Express (formerly Horse Hill) chairlift / gondola. The lifts are owned by Buller Ski Lifts P/L, a part of the Grollo group of companies.The Grollo Group - Property Tourism investment =History= A Mount Buller Post Office opened on 17 February 1958. Before 1984 Mount Buller was serviced by two lift companies that involved the skier needing to purchase two lift tickets to ski the whole mountain. In 1985, the two lift companies merged, allowing skiers to ski the whole mountain with one ticket. Today, Mount Buller is serviced by 22 lifts covering a wide range of terrain. In 1993, with an increasing number of visitors, the ski resort built a new quad chairlift called Wombat Lift on the skiers right of Little Buller spur to relieve the traffic on Federation triple chairlift. 2005 saw the addition of the Emirates quad chairlift to the lift network. A new six-seater chairlift was installed over the 2007/08 summer and is operational for 2008. This addition saw the decommissioning of one of the oldest chairs of the mountain ‚Äî the Abom (previously known as Helicopter), along with Blue Bullet 2. In 2012 a new quad chairlift (Bonza) was built in the area of the old Burnt Hut T-Bar. A new carpet was also built. In December 2018 the construction of a new 6 seat chairlift commenced to replace the ageing Blue Bullet Quad. A new Plata lift to replace the upper rope tow on Chamois is also being installed for the 2019 season. A list of all lifts that have operated at Mount Buller is at the Australian ski lift directory. =Facilities= There are around of groomed trails spread over more than 300 hectares of terrain. 25% is beginner terrain, 45% intermediate and 30% advanced. There are also of cross-country trails accessible from the village. These trails also connect Mount Buller with Mount Stirling. Australia's first resort-wide wireless internet service is available in the village, operated by Whispar. 22 Lifts at Mount Buller include Blue Bullet Express, Boggy Creek, Bonza, Bourke Street Carpet, Bull Run, Canyon Tows, Cattleman's Carpets, Federation, Gliders Carpet, Grimus, Happy Feet Carpet, Mercedes Benz Chair, Howqua, Koflers, Lydia Lassila Chairlift, Northside Express (formerly Horse Hill), Fox-Chairlift, Skyline, South Side, Summit, Tirol, Wombat. =Events= Mount Buller usually hosts two International Ski Federation Aerial Skiing World Cup events every year in September. However, these events were cancelled in 2007 due to lack of sponsorship. Every year Mount Buller also hosts the Victorian Snowsports Championships, which has with over 3000 competitors. The Mount Buller summit and faces are also popular with ice climbers especially in winter. Transportation on the Mt Buller mountain village has previously been provided by Mansfield Mount Buller Bus Lines Pty Ltd; however, a change in supplier from the 2019 snow season has seen TravelSafe Bus Hire Pty Ltd being appointed as the official transit provider for Mt Buller for at least one year which could lead to a 10 year exclusive contract. However, TravelSafe's performance was poor, plagued by technical difficulties and was unable to keep up with the service load. Now TravelSafe and Mansfield Mount Buller Bus Lines co-exist on the mountain with both handling transportation. Snowmaking Snowmaking began on Mount Buller in the 1970s with a pilot system on Enzian Ski Run, which was later moved to Bourke Street. The main snowmaking infrastructure was installed in 1994 at the Snowflake Factory on the top of Baldy. This included the water storage reservoir, air compressors, pump station and distribution pipelines for water and compressed air. The snowmaking system infrastructure and distribution pipelines were designed and built to accommodate future increases in capacity as coverage areas are increased. The Mount Buller snowmaking systems use a combination system of fan and air/water guns. The system is based around a central high level water storage reservoir, pump station and central air compressor station. Large distribution pipelines deliver the water and compressed air to the various ski runs. Water and compressed air delivery hydrants are located down the edge of the runs where the snow guns are coupled using flexible snowmaking hoses.

From Mining and Scientific Press 52 (1886): 237. Arrastra demonstration in Liberty, Washington, 2007 An arrastra (or arastra) is a primitive mill for grinding and pulverizing (typically) gold or silver ore. Its simplest form is two or more flat-bottomed drag stones placed in a circular pit paved with flat stones, and connected to a center post by a long arm. With a horse, mule or human providing power at the other end of the arm, the stones were dragged slowly around in a circle, crushing the ore. Some arrastras were powered by a water wheel; a few were powered by steam or gasoline engines, and even electricity. Arrastras were widely used throughout the Mediterranean region since Phoenician times. The Spanish introduced the arrastra to the New World in the 16th century. The word \\"arrastra\\" comes from the Spanish language arrastrar, meaning to drag along the ground. Arrastras were suitable for use in small or remote mines, since they could be built from local materials and required little investment capital. For gold ore, the gold was typically recovered by amalgamation with quicksilver. The miner would add clean mercury to the ground ore, continue grinding, rinse out the fines, then add more ore and repeat the process. At cleanup, the gold amalgam was carefully recovered from the low places and crevices in the arrastra floor. The amalgam was then heated in a distillation retort to recover the gold, and the mercury was saved for reuse. For silver ore, the patio process, invented in Mexico in 1554, was generally used to recover the silver from ore ground in the arrastra.

Michael Grubbs is also known for his role as \\"Grubbs\\" on One Tree Hill, where the band's music has been featured. They reached critical acclaim with their 2010 release, Almost Everything I Wish I'd Said the Last Time I Saw You which reached No. 1 on the Billboard's Heatseekers Chart. History Michael Grubbs was born and raised in Richmond, Virginia and began his career as a musician at the age of 5, taking lessons from his mother, a long time piano and choir instructor. Earlier influences included the church music he was forced to practice as rudiments, as well as classical composers such as Brahms, Bach, and Beethoven. As a teenager, Michael discovered the song books of the likes of Billy Joel, Elton John, and Led Zeppelin as a more culturally relevant counterbalance to his classical canon. Following a few early ventures into performance, Grubbs spent time with two touring musicals - Brigadoon and Camelot - standing out both for his technical ability as well as his exceptional aesthetic. Grubbs came to New York City in 1998 and soon came to be an understudy of the notable Lach, one of the main proponents and founding fathers of the Anti-folk movement in New York's Lower East Side, from whom he learned to channel energy and inspiration from what he characterized as a repressed background into a style of music that was more accessible to today's audience. As an active member of this movement he came up alongside the likes of Regina Spektor and Moldy Peaches. His greatest musical break came from meeting Mark Schwahn, critically acclaimed head writer and executive producer of The CW drama series, One Tree Hill. After being introduced to Schwahn and playing for him at an open mic in New York City, Grubb's song War Sweater, the title track from his War Sweater EP, was featured on the finale of One Tree Hill's sixth season. Following that placement, Schwahn offered to give Grubbs cameos on the show to promote a new record including performances of his songs Brooklyn, Light Outside, and Almost Everything. Wakey!Wakey! signed with The Family Records, a Manhattan based independent record label, under which they released their full-length debut album Almost Everything I Wish I'd Said the Last Time I Saw You....

Generally classified as a \\"composite romance,\\" that is, a romance that does not fit easily into the standard classification of romances, it is praised for its realism and plot. The poem is preserved in two manuscripts along with a variety of secular and courtly texts, one of which was compiled by the fifteenth-century scribe Robert Thornton. It is notable for its blending of literary material and social reality. The title character, while a perfect knight in many respects, is initially reluctant to love. His life changes when he seeks redress from his neighbour for the killing of his men and damages done to his property. He falls in love with the neighbour's daughter, and after she initially denies him her love, she accepts him. They both convince the overbearing and initially violent father to grant Degrevant his daughter's hand in marriage. Plot The plot of Sir Degrevant revolves around the title character and his neighbour, an earl, whose daughter Myldore falls in love with Sir Degrevant. While there is a \\"perfunctory connection\\" with King Arthur and his court, the romance is devoid of the usual marvels associated with Arthurian literature. Sir Degrevant is the \\"perfect romance hero\\":Sylvester p. 18. intent on hunting and adventures, he is young, handsome, and strong; most importantly to the plot, he is not interested in the love of a woman. While he is on a crusade, his neighbour, an earl, does great damage to Degrevant's property and kills the foresters who oversee his deer park. Degrevant hurries back from Granada, repairs the fences and the other damage done, then addresses a letter to the earl seeking legal redress. When the earl refuses to make reparations, Degrevant avenges himself by attacking the earl's hunting troop and then his castle. During this latter engagement, the earl's daughter, Melydor, watches from the castle walls and Degrevant falls in love with her. Melydor initially rebuffs Degrevant's attempt to declare his love, but later grants it to him. Her father sets up a tournament to promote the chances of another suitor (the Duke of Gerle), but Degrevant defeats him thrice. The lovers meet secretly in her splendidly decorated bedroom (it contains paintings of saints and angels, and such details as glass from Westphalia and \\"curtain cords made of mermaids' hair won by Duke Betyse,\\"Gibbs p. 39. a reference to a duke from a fourteenth-century chanson de geste Les Voeux du paonGibbs p. 156 note to l. 510.), but they remain chaste until marriage. Finally, the earl agrees to his daughter's engagement with Degrevant, convinced by his daughter and his wife's pleas and by Degrevant's obvious chivalry and strength. The couple have seven children and enjoy a happy and prosperous life together. When Melydor dies, Degrevant returns to the crusade and dies in the Holy Land. Characters *Sir Degrevant‚Äîyoung, handsome, and strong, he embodies all the values of knighthood. The beginning of the narrative finds him crusading, where he is fighting for personal fame. He is also a landowner, and as such has legal and economic concerns as well. He is initially referred to as a nephew of King Arthur and Sir Gawain, opening up the possibility that he is Agravain‚Äîhis name possibly being a misreading of the Old French d'Egrivaunt.Gibbs p. 137 note to l. 11. *Melydor‚Äîthe earl's beautiful daughter. While also a beauty in the traditional sense of romance, she is not devoid of practical sense: when Degrevant attempts to seduce her, she responds by saying \\"Thou touchest non swych thing / Or thou wed me with a ryng, / And maryage fulfille.\\"Gibbs p. 157. Her name is possibly influenced by the name of Duke Betyse's lover Ydorus.Gibbs p. 156 notes to l. 510 and l. 511. *Earl‚Äîthe unnamed earl is in many ways the opposite of Degrevant: he takes advantage of his neighbour's absence, and does not act in a chivalrous manner until the end of the story. *Degrevant's squire‚Äîa clever and educated assistant who functions as a messenger to the Earl and a go-between for Degrevant and Melydor *Melydor's maid‚Äîinstrumental, with the squire, in bringing about the encounters between the lovers *Countess‚Äîthe Earl's wife, who pleads with him in vain that he stop harassing his neighbor's land and settle the conflict. Composition The poem is dated in the early fifteenth century. Its verse is tail rhyme, in stanzas of sixteen lines with \\"conventional thematic and verbal formulas.\\" There are no known sources or analogues. The poem survives in two manuscripts from the late fifteenth or early sixteenth century, the Findern Anthology and the Lincoln Thornton MS. The Findern Anthology (Cambridge University Library, MS Ff.1.6) contains a variety of texts (the manuscript itself is a composite, like the poem, according to Davenport) with secular and courtly poetry, including selections from Geoffrey Chaucer (Parlement of Foules and other texts), John Gower (some tales from the Confessio Amantis), and John Lydgate (various shorter poems and other texts). Sir Degrevant is the only full-length romance in the manuscript.Davenport 111-12. The Lincoln Thornton MS (Lincoln, Dean and Chapter Library MS 91) contains seven romances copied by Roberth Thornton, the fifteenth-century landowner, scribe, and manuscript compiler. Critical assessment The romance is praised for its realism. George Kane writes, \\"The love affair, made exciting by the risk with which it is conducted, is very close to life in some of its touches. The effects of this romance, supported by skillful construction, a tone perfectly maintained, characters realistically conceived and developed, and a tolerably incisive narrative, is entirely good and persuasive.\\"Kane p. 90. Other critics agree; Arlyn Diamond notes the \\"lively plot and remarkable density of description.\\" W.A. Davenport analyzes the poet's popular verse form and contrasts it with the broad vocabulary used in the poem, and identifies literary borrowing from \\"alliterative poetry, love-lyric, and court allegory, as well as literary romance\\"; he concludes that the result of the poet's skill in \\"mixing\\" of themes and styles makes for \\"an unusually well-constructed and unified narrative.\\"Davenport p. 129. Themes =Love= As W.A. Davenport noted, the composite nature of the poem also involves extensive debates on love, between Sir Degrevant and his squire, between Degrevant and Melydor, and between Melydor and her maid. Further debate on love takes place when Melydor (in the company of her maid) and Degrevant (with his squire) meet in her orchard, \\"an archetypal, courtly pastoral setting\\", into which Degrevant and his squire have entered, fully armed.Davenport pp. 121-23. According to Davenport, one of the poet's intentions was to express the \\"wonders and restraints of virtuous love.\\" The love of Degrevant and Melydor, though the wooing in presented as classical courtly love, ends in marriage and children‚Äîa deviation from the original formulation of courtly love that grew common in romances of this era.Gervase Mathew, \\"Marriage and Amour Courtois in Late Fourteenth Century England\\", Essays Presented to Charles William edited by C. S. Lewis p 132 =Social issues and conflicts= Scholars have seen in the poem a reflection of fifteenth-century concerns with matchmaking between noble families. The happy ending, which unites two formerly conflicted families through marriage, allows for the peaceful resolution of competing sexual and economic interests.Diamond pp. 83-84. A.C. Gibbs notes that the romance, with all its literary elements (of duels, quests, and love) is also a reminder of the social reality of knighthood. The titular hero is also a landowner, with all the pursuant cares, and is called back from his crusade by the news that his men and his property have been attacked by his unchivalrous neighbour. Realistic elements (as opposed to literary convention) also play a part in the plot‚Äîfor instance, Degrevant ambushes the earl, and uses arrows as an offensive weapon; there is never a formal duel between the two opponents.Gibbs pp. 38-39. =Gender and desire= Since the romance is concerned with household and marriage, it also opens up a space for female desire and for the discussion of the difference between male and female desire. Diamond summarizes: > What women want is a handsome, valiant, wealthy and noble lover, triumph > over fierce paternal opposition, a splendid wardrobe, and a fabulous room of > their own. What men want is a noble reputation, a huge deer park in which to > spend their days hunting, extensive and prosperous estates, triumph over > would-be oppressors, and a beautiful opinionated heiress.Diamond p. 82. With its happy ending, the romance suggests that these different desires can be reconciled. Louise Sylvester, in a study of heterosexuality in medieval romance, argues that the love affair between Melydor and Degrevant develops according to stereotypical masculinist heterosexual Western patterns. Love happens to people and is not an act of will; Degrevant, as a strong knight, is undone by his feelings and loses all interest in other activities, such as hunting; he vehemently denies the suggestion by his squire that he be interested in the daughter because of the earl's wealth; at least the initial encounter between the two lovers is completely dominated by his perspective and his feelings.Sylvester pp. 18-22. Moreover, she notes after a linguistic analysis that even Melydor's very language (which has more slips and meaningless tags than Degrevant's), which Sylvester qualifies as \\"powerless speech,\\" serves to deny her an independent and powerful status.Sylvester pp. 24-25. Publication The romance was edited by Leslie Casson for the Early English Text Society and published in 1949; this edition is generally preferred by scholars.Diamond p. 98 note 1. In 1966, A.C. Gibbs published a selection from the romance in the York Medieval Texts series.

These roles and processes are ones that aid in setting direction, creating alignment and maintaining commitment in groups of people sharing common work. Most organizational leadership research and educational programs have focused on developing individual-based knowledge, skills, and abilities associated with formal leadership roles (human capital) of individuals (Day, 2000). Leader development therefore results by investing in human capital. Developmental theory While there is no specific theory from which leader development derives, developmental theory taps into two aspects of development: learning and change. Development is a form of change and it is impossible for a leader to develop without change occurring (Day & Zacarro, 2004). Learning is defined as the attainment of a permanent change in a person because of practice or experience, which then drives change and development (Day & Zacarro, 2004). Learning stems from two traditions: a permanent change in behavior following experience based on behaviorism, and a change in or creation of new mental models based on Gestalt psychology. Behaviorism allows for performance to be used as an indicator of a leader's behavior. In contrast, Gestalt psychology examines the creation of new mental models that arise from experience, which can help a leader develop their intrapersonal competence. Together, behaviorism and Gestalt traditions are thought to be complementary in the fact that development comes from both changing mental models and creating new behaviors (Hogan and Warrenfeltz, 2003). Differentiating between leader development and leadership development Leader development is described as one aspect of the broader process of leadership development (McCauley et al., 2010). Leadership development is defined as the expansion of a group's capacity to produce direction, alignment, and commitment (McCauley et al.), in contrast to leader development which is the expansion of a one's ability to be effective in leadership roles and processes. Further distinctions between the two can be made by looking at components of each model. Leader development focuses on developing individual knowledge, skills, and abilities (human capital), whereas leadership development focuses on building networked relationships (social capital) among individuals in an organization. Leader development keys in on the assumption that effective leadership occurs through the development of individual leaders, whereas leadership development is a function of the social resources that are rooted in relationships (Day, 2000). In leader development, the focus is on intrapersonal skills of self-awareness, self-regulation, and self- motivation; leadership development focuses on interpersonal skills of social awareness and social skills (Day, 2000). Day (2000) argues that what most organizations term as leadership development should be more accurately labeled as leader development. Organizations cannot choose one or the other approach, but instead a bridge must be anchored on either side of leader and leadership development for effective development to occur (Kegan, 1994). Therefore, it is important to develop the intrapersonal capabilities to serve as a foundation for interpersonal competence and link both leader and leadership development together. Differentiating between leader development and management development Management development and leadership development can often be confused as one. Although they also can overlap, there are key differences between the two that are not to get confused with leader development. Leadership processes allow groups of people to work together, whereas management processes are considered to be position and organization specific (Keys & Wolf, 1988). Management development includes managerial education and training (Latham & Seijts, 1998; Mailick, Stumpf, Grant, Kfir, & Watson, 1998). There is a greater emphasis on gaining specific types of knowledge, skills, and abilities to enhance task performance in management roles (Baldwin & Padgett,1994; Keys & Wolfe, 1988; Wexley & Baldwin, 1986). Also, management development's goal is to apply proven solutions to problems giving it more of a training orientation. Management development focuses more on the formal managerial roles. Leader development model McCauley, Van Veslor, and Ruderman (2010) explain a two-part model for developing leaders. The first part illustrates three elements that combine to make developmental experiences stronger: assessment, challenge and support. Assessment lets leaders know where they stand in areas of strengths, current performance level, and developmental needs. Challenging experiences are ones that stretch a leader's ability to work outside of their comfort zone, develop new skills and abilities, and provide important opportunities to learn. Support, which comes in the form of bosses, co-workers, friends, family, coaches and mentors, enables leaders to handle the struggle of developing. The second part of the leader development model (McCauley et al., 2010) illustrates that the leader development process involves a variety of developmental experiences and the ability to learn from them. These experiences and the ability to learn also affect each other in that a leader with a high ability to learn will search for developmental experiences and through developmental experiences leaders will increase their ability to learn. It is also important to note that the leader development process is rooted in a particular leadership context which includes elements such as age, culture, economic conditions, gender of the population, organizational purpose and mission, and business strategy (McCauley et al.). This environment molds the leader development process. Along with assessment, challenge and support, leadership context are important aspects of the leader development model. YGLP YGLP is an international leadership program for university and high school students aiming to groom young minds into exemplary leaders. YGLP was developed by Human Science Lab, London, with support from several transnational organizations and foundations. The objective behind creation of YGLP was to come up with a path-breaking leadership model that could be used across the globe to create a new generation of leaders who can push the limit of human accomplishments to new frontier. The Four-Step Leadership theory formulated under the HSL Leadership Project at Human Science Lab, London, provides the scientific framework for YGLP. The theory stipulates that \\"the leadership achievement of an individual is proportional to the optimal use of four principal components that makes a leader ‚Äìmotivation, planning, energising and executing\\". YGLP contains four core modules and one non-core module. Each core module is designed to optimise one of the four leadership component enumerated in the Four-Step Leadership Principle i.e. motivating, planning, energising and executing. Intrapersonal competencies There are three types of intrapersonal competencies related to leader development: self-awareness (emotional awareness, self-confidence, and accurate self-image), self-regulation (self-control, trustworthiness, adaptability and personal responsibility), and self-motivation (commitment, initiative, and optimism) (Day, 2000). =Self-awareness= In today's changing environment, the two personal capabilities that allow a leader to learn new skills or competencies are self-awareness (identity) and adaptability (Briscoe & Hall, 1999; Hall, 1986a, 1986b, 2002). Leader development is personal development and involves the process of becoming more aware of one's self (Hall, 2004). Self-awareness is the extent to which people are conscious of various aspects of their identities and the extent to which their self-perceptions are congruent with the way others perceive them (Hall, 2004). Self-awareness has been referred to as \\"the first component of emotional intelligence\\" and discusses how it is \\"the ability to recognize and understand your moods, emotions, and drives, as well as their effects on others\\" (Goleman, 1998, p. 95). This is vital for a leader to be able to evaluate themselves to recognize their impact on their thinking and decisions as well as on other individuals. =Self-regulation= Self-regulation has been conceptualized in proposed models by Tsui and Ashford (1994) as well as Wood and Bandura (1989). The models have some differences but agree on a fundamental sequence where individuals (a) regulate their attention and effort around self-set goals or assigned goals, (b) take action to achieve their goals, (c) obtain their goals or their performance strategy, if necessary, to maintain or enhance their progress toward their goals and (e) recommence the cycle. Tsui and Ashford (1994) describe the procedure as setting the goal, behaving, detecting a discrepancy, and lastly reducing any discrepancy. This process is vital in leader development because it can have both internal and external effects. As Sosik, Potosky, and Jung (2002) stated that, \\"individuals desire congruence between their own and others‚Äô perceptions of their behavior, and, therefore, set and work toward goals to reduce perceptual discrepancies, gain congruence, and improve their effectiveness\\" (p. 212). This is similar to the intrapersonal competence of self-awareness as individuals want their own perception of themselves be congruent with those of others, both outlining importance for leader development. =Self-motivation= Self-motivation involves having higher levels of identification to be motivated to go beyond contracts and exchanges in both their own development and performance (Hall, 2004). Together, the capabilities of self-awareness, self-regulation and self- motivation allow for enhanced individual knowledge, trust, and personal power, which can be seen as fundamental to create in a leader (Zand, 1997). Modes of development Leader development takes place through multiple mechanisms: formal instruction, developmental job assignments, 360-degree feedback, executive coaching, and self-directed learning (Boyce, Zaccaro & Wisecarver, 2009; Day, 2000). These mechanisms may occur independently, but are more effective in combination. =Formal training= Organizations often offer formal training programs to their leaders. Traditional styles provide leaders with required knowledge and skills in a particular area by utilizing coursework, practice, \\"overlearning\\" with rehearsals, and feedback (Kozlowski, 1998). This traditional lecture-based classroom training is useful, however, the limitations include the leader's ability to transfer the information from a training environment to a work setting. =Developmental job assignments= Following formal training organizations should assign leaders to developmental jobs that target the newly acquired skills (Zacarro & Banks, 2004). A job that is developmental is one in which leaders learn, undergo personal change, and gain leadership skills resulting from the roles, responsibilities and tasks involved in that job (McCauley & Brutus, 1998). Developmental job assignments are one of the most effective forms of leader development (Ohlott, 2004). After training a leader should first complete a \\"stamping-in\\" assignment\\". A \\"stamping-in\\" assignment is one in which the leader masters the new skills before moving on to a \\"stretch assignment\\" (Zacarro & Banks). The \\"stretch\\" or developmental assignment challenges the leader's new skills and pushes them out of their comfort zone to operate in a more complex environment involving new elements, problems and dilemmas to resolve (Ohlott, 2004). A truly development assignment doesn‚Äôt depend on existing skills, it challenges the leader to understand his or her current limitations and develop new skills (Zaccaro & Banks). These assignments should be given to leaders who do not possess the skills to succeed at the current assignment, but who have the ability to succeed at higher levels (Zaccarro & Banks). Developmental assignments should be accompanied by appropriate feedback that assesses the leader's strengths and weaknesses in order to be successful (Zaccaro & Banks). =Three hundred and sixty-degree feedback= Three hundred and sixty-degree feedback is a necessary component of leader development which allows leaders to maximize learning opportunities from their current assignment. It systematically provides the leader with perceptions of his or her performance from a full circle of viewpoints including subordinates, peers, superiors (Day, 2000), and the leader's own self-assessment (Zaccaro & Banks, 2004). With many different sources from which to interpret information, the messages may differ and be difficult to interpret. However, when several different sources concur on a similar perspective, whether a strength or weakness, the clarity of the message increases (King & Santana, 2010). For this mechanism to be effective, the leader must accept feedback and be open and willing to make changes. An effective way to facilitate the feedback through open discussion and to help facilitate change is through coaching (Day, 2000). =Executive coaching= The goal of executive coaching focuses on enhancing the leader's effectiveness along with the effectiveness of the team and organization (Frankovelgia & Riddle, 2010). It involves an intense one-on-one relationship designed at learning important lessons through assessment, challenge, and support. Although coaching is sometimes aimed at correcting a fault, it is being used more and more to help already successful leaders move to the next level of increased responsibilities, and new and complex challenges. Coaching must move toward measurable goals that contribute to individual and organizational growth. Day (2000) proposes that leaders should be carefully selected, willing to change, and matched with a compatible coach in order for coaching to be most effective. =Self-directed learning= Self-directed learning is an individual leader's aim in identifying the focus of development, specifying the developmental processes, and identifying the resources (Boyce, Zaccaro, & Wisecarver, 2010). Self-development is the process of not only acquiring new skills but also gaining an understanding of the leader's environment and self through new experiences and activities, such as seeking out mentors or developmental job assignments (Boyce, Zaccaro, & Wisecarver, 2010). Application The Army has been conducting leader development studies since as early as 1971; studies include a review of education and training for Army officers, and professional development of officers, warrant officers, and non-commissioned officers. In 1987, the Army Chief of Staff directed a comprehensive leader development study to be conducted which produced the Army's leader development system, a support system to monitor and adapt to the effects of change on Army leader development, and a leader development action plan (U.S. Army, 1994). The U.S. Army Research Institute's (ARI) research topics include training, leader development, and soldier research and development. One area ARI's leadership development program focuses on is ways to provide accelerated development of Army leaders.

It was completed in 1895 to a design by the landscape architect H. E. Milner. Since 2005, media publicity has been given to reports of a number of dogs either falling or jumping from the bridge, resulting in injury or death upon landing on the rocks some below; the bridge has also been the site of a murder and an attempted suicide. Explanations for these deaths have ranged from claims of ghosts and supernatural causes to natural explanations of dogs being attracted to the scent or sounds of nearby animals in the undergrowth, and consequently losing their balance on the sloping surfaces of the bridge's parapet. History and construction bartizans Lord Overtoun had inherited Overtoun House and its estate in 1891. He purchased the neighbouring Garshake estate to the west of his lands in 1892. Carriages had been unable to gain access to the Overtoun mansion along the old eastern approach road as the incline was too steep; work commenced on constructing a new driveway as soon as Garshake was acquired. Designed by the civil engineer and landscape architect H. E. Milner, the bridge was constructed using rough-faced ashlar and was completed in June 1895. It comprises three arches: a large central arch spanning a deep valley at the bottom of which flows the Overtoun Burn, flanked on each side by lower, smaller pedestrian arches. Unexplained dog deaths The bridge spans a deep ravine. From approximately 2005 onwards, stories of dogs apparently leaping to their deaths from the bridge for unknown reasons have been published online, the first of which ‚Äì according to the Glaswegian organisation Glasgow Skeptics ‚Äì was published in 2005, mentioned in passing in a forum thread about lesser- known attractions and destinations in Glasgow. The story gained prominence in 2006 following a Daily Mail article on the subject, after which reported deaths of dogs being walked on the bridge received international media attention. A number of theories have been proposed as to the behaviour of dogs on the bridge. In 2014, canine psychologist David Sands proposed that the surrounding foliage ‚Äì giving the in-reality extremely steep drop off the side of the bridge the appearance of even ground ‚Äì combined with the residual odour from male mink urine in the area could be culprit for luring dogs to jump off the bridge. This theory was protested by a local hunter and resident for 50 years, John Joyce, who stated that there were \\"no mink [in the area].\\" However, in an investigation by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and Wildlife, RSPB Officer for the Isle of Mull David Sexton found that one end of the bridge reportedly favoured by dogs contained \\"nests of mice, squirrels, and minks.\\" Furthermore, in an experiment in which ten dogs were exposed to canisters filled with mouse, squirrel and mink scent, seven of the dogs \\"all went straight for the mink scent, many of them quite dramatically.\\" Suggestions of paranormal activity have also been claimed as a reason for the unusual behaviour of dogs on the bridge. In 2019, the owners of Overtoun House, Bob and Melissa Hill, said that in 17 years of residing at the House, they had witnessed a number of dogs become agitated, jump up, and fall from the bridge. Bob Hill, originally a pastor from Texas, stated that the scent of mink, pine martens, and other animals agitated the dogs, resulting in their jump onto the bridge wall: > The dogs catch the scent of mink, pine martens or some other mammal and then > they will jump up on the wall of the bridge. And because it‚Äôs tapered, they > will just topple over. Hill also stated, however, his belief that the grounds of the House held a spiritual quality, with experiences of the supernatural being common amongst people living in Scotland. Other events In October 1994, a man threw his two-week-old son to his death from the bridge because he believed that his son was an incarnation of the Devil. He then attempted to commit suicide several times, first by attempting to jump off the bridge, later by slashing his wrists.

Hanley, Encyclopedia of Modern Christian Politics: L-Z, p. 516. and ran an upholstery company in Sloane Street. He was active in the Chelsea Mission, and through that joined the Salvation Army in its early days. In 1884 he moved to the United States to quell a secessionist movement among the Salvationists there, then returned to the UK as the first leader of the Social Wing of the Salvation Army. On the voyage to America he read Henry George's book, Progress and Poverty which introduced him to Georgist ideas. In 1890, he co-wrote In Darkest England and the Way Out with William Booth. However, he left the movement later in the year, to involve himself in the labour movement, founding the Labour Army and Workers' Cry, a newspaper which he edited from two years. In 1892, he became editor of the Weekly Dispatch, holding the post for three years. Smith stood unsuccessfully in Hammersmith at the 1892 general election,The Austen Chamberlain Diary Letters, p. 207. but he was elected to the London County Council, playing a key role on the body until 1913. He became a founding member of the Independent Labour Party (ILP), and was its first parliamentary candidate, at the 1894 Sheffield Attercliffe by-election. A close friend of its leader, Keir Hardie, he drew on some experience in radical journalism to assist with the relaunch of the Labour Leader.Carl Levy, Socialism and the Intelligentsia, 1880‚Äì1914, p. 152. Smith also stood in Glasgow Tradeston at the 1895 general election, in the meantime involving himself in spiritualism and the Brotherhood Movement, emphasising that, for him, socialism was entirely compatible with religion. After the election, he undertook a speaking tour of the United States with Hardie. In 1901, he resigned his council seat and rejoined the Salvation Army, but continued as an active socialist, becoming Secretary of the National Right to Work Council in 1908. The ILP was a founding element of the Labour Party, and Smith stood under this label in many elections: the 1909 Taunton by-election, 1909 Croydon by-election, in Chatham in December 1910, Balham and Tooting in 1918, Birmingham West in 1922 and 1923, and Nuneaton in 1924.

It was made up of members of the Australian Labor Party in the Australian Parliament from 1945 to 1949. Background When Labor Prime Minister John Curtin died towards the end of the Second World War in July 1945, Frank Forde served as Prime Minister from 6‚Äì13 July, before the party elected Ben Chifley as Curtin's successor. In office Following his 1945 election as leader of the Australian Labor Party after the death of John Curtin, Chifley, a former railway engine driver, became Australia's 16th Prime Minister on 13 July 1945.Chifley, Joseph Benedict (Ben) (1885‚Äì1951) Biographical Entry ‚Äì Australian Dictionary of Biography Online The Second World War ended with the defeat of Japan in the Pacific just four weeks later. Chifley served as Prime Minister and Treasurer. To combat inflationary pressures, he proposed a continuation of wartime price and import controls, and rationing of scarce commodities. Chifley went on to win the 1946 election. Labor won 43 House of Representatives seats, with 15 won by the newly formed Liberal Party of Australia led by Robert Menzies, and 11 by their coalition partner, the Country Party (a further 4 seats went to splinter parties). In the Senate, Labor won 16 seats and the Liberal‚ÄìCountry Party coalition won 3 seats.Elections ‚Äì Ben Chifley ‚Äì Australia's PMs ‚Äì Australia's Prime Ministers H V Evatt (left) and Ben Chifley (middle) with Clement Attlee (right) at the Dominion and British Leaders Conference, London, 1946 Labor had sought to secure power over the supply of money and credit ‚Äì amidst opposition from the private banks. The High Court of Australia invalidated part of his government's banking legislation, so in mid-1947 Chifley legislated to require at least local authorities and State governments to bank with the federally owned Commonwealth Bank. The Melbourne City Council successfully appealed against the legislation in the High Court. In response Chifley then proposed the total nationalisation of the banks. The move alarmed conservatives and Menzies said it foretold of a 'coming dictatorship in Australia'. Chifley told parliament the legislation would guard against both depression and inflation. Country Party leader Earle Page described the plan as a 'communist ramp'. The High Court declared the law unconstitutional and an appeal to the Privy Council upheld that ruling. Chifley nevertheless refused to repeal the law, and it remained a controversial issue at the 1949 election. In the pursuit of centralist economic policy, the Chifley Government also confirmed the continuation of the wartime measure under which the Commonwealth was the sole collector of income tax. Major national projects were also instituted, including the Snowy Mountains Scheme and an assisted immigration program. Despite demobilisation of Australian forces following war's end, Australia faced a labour shortage and Minister for Immigration Arthur Calwell launched the post war migration program ‚Äì intended to bring out mainly British migrants to augment the Australian population. In foreign policy, attorney-general and minister for external affairs H V Evatt was active in the formation of the United Nations. Australia played a significant mediatory role in the early years of the United Nations, successfully lobbying for an increased role for smaller and middle-ranking nations, and a stronger commitment to employment rights into the U.N. Charter. Evatt was elected president of the third session of the United Nations General Assembly (September 1948 to May 1949).Evatt, Herbert Vere (Bert) (1894‚Äì1965) Biographical Entry ‚Äì Australian Dictionary of Biography Online Internationally, the rise of Communism was a developing concern for many in Australia. Chifley sought to oppose the re-establishment of Dutch control of Indonesia and refused help to British efforts to quell the developing insurgency in Malaya. The Catholic-based \\"Movement\\" meanwhile campaigned strongly to drive Communists out of leadership positions in trade unions, prefiguring a coming split in the ALP over the growing influence of the Movement. At the conference of the New South Wales Labor Party in June 1949, Chifley sought to define the labour movement as having: With an increasingly uncertain economic outlook, and after his attempt to nationalise the banks, his government's continuation of some wartime controls, and a strike by the Communist-dominated Miners Federation, Chifley lost office at the 1949 federal election to Robert Menzies' Liberal-Country Party Coalition. The Liberal Party won 55 seats and its coalition partner the Country Party 19 in the House of Representatives, as opposed to Labor's 47 seats.

In 1969, he exhibited in the seminal TV as a Creative Medium show (widely regarded as one of the birth pangs of video art) at the Howard Wise Gallery and cofounded the Raindance Foundation with Frank Gillette, Michael Shamberg and Ira Schneider.Paul Ryan in Edge - The third culture While McLuhan depicted World War III in 1970 as a \\"guerrilla information war,\\"Strangelove (2005) p.105Mcluhan (1970) p.66 quote: \\"World War III is a guerrilla information war with no division between military and civilian participation.\\" in the same year Ryan wrote \\"Cybernetic Guerrilla Warfare\\" for Raindance's Radical Software journal, anticipating the subsequent development of guerrilla television in 1971.Shamberg (1971)Greenwald (2007) The Process is in the Streets, pp.174-6Greenwald (2007) The Grassroots Video PioneersRyan (1970) Shortly thereafter, Ryan founded Earthscore, an intentional community in New York's Hudson Valley inspired by Gregory Bateson's writings on cybernetic feedback and the triadic thought of Charles Sanders Peirce; this precipitated the development of the Earthscore semiotic system as initially delineated in the peremptory section of Cybernetics of the Sacred, a collection of essays published in 1974. The resultant \\"Threeing\\"‚Äîa video demonstrating \\"a ‚Äòyoga‚Äô of relationships... in which three people take turns playing three different roles; initiator, respondent and mediator\\"‚Äîpremiered at The Kitchen in 1976. This led to Ryan's conceptual development of the relational circuit, \\"an original topological figure that synthesizes cybernetics and semiotics\\" with applications in such disparate fields as international relations and conflict resolution.http://www.library.utoronto.ca/see/SEED/Vol4-1/Ryan.htm As an artist, Ryan exhibited and performed at The Kitchen, the Rose Art Museum, the Museum of Modern Art, The Cloisters, the Venice Biennial, and the Dancing Theatre in New Paltz, New York. He taught at New York University, the State University of New York at New Paltz, the Savannah College of Art and Design, and The New School, where he was an associate professor of media studies at the time of his death.

He specializes in phenomenology, hermeneutics, contemporary German philosophy, and East-West comparative philosophy. He has worked with continental philosophers such as Martin Heidegger and Hans-Georg Gadamer. He currently teaches at State University of New York. Cho's seminars have traditionally centered on discussions anchored in close textual and hermeneutical readings of works in the phenomenological tradition, including Heidegger's Fundamental Concepts of Metaphysics, Being and Time, and Gadamer's Truth and Method. Education Cho graduated from Seoul National University in South Korea in 1952, and then went to the University of Heidelberg in Germany to pursue a Ph.D., completing it in 1957. Career Cho became a professor at SUNY in 1971, and since then has also served as a visiting professor at a number of institutions including the University of Bochum in Germany and Osaka University in Japan.Curriculum vitae Dr. Cho was awarded the Fulbright Senior Research Professorship Award in 1961, the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation Research Grant in 1989, and 1997.  Philosophy  In his attempt to bring Asian thought to the attention of Western readers, Cho adopted a markedly different approach from that of Japanese philosophers, as Landgrebe pointed out. While most Japanese are used to relying on their own Zen Buddhist tradition as the basis for assimilating Western philosophy, Cho appealed to more original Chinese sources of Taoism and Neo-Confucianism in order to implement a much wider ranging conversation between the two traditions. The most important tool for this cross cultural research, for Cho, is Husserl's phenomenology. It is significant not only for its methodical thrust into the depth dimension of conscious and subconscious experience. Phenomenology provides, as Cho often emphasizes, the purest \\"optical instrument\\" with built- in possibilities for self-correction. If philosophy is in its essence the pursuit of self-knowledge, then the objectives for Asian philosophers are clearly mapped from the beginning. They are called upon to turn to their own traditions and engage their Western colleagues in conversations based on what they can positively contribute to sharing a higher and better level of knowledge.

Origin and application The word \\"eruciform\\" literally means \\"caterpillar-shaped\\" (from Latin \\"eruca\\", a caterpillar ‚Äî confusingly, in Latin \\"Eruca\\" also was used as the name for a rape-like plant, but that has no clear connection to the current context). One should not take the \\"caterpillar-shaped\\" description too seriously; there are many shapes of caterpillars besides the typical silkworm larva, and insect larvae of many shapes, not obviously caterpillar-like, are described as eruciform. Some, for example, are in fact shaped like certain other, straight, eruciform larvae, except that they are curved into a C-shape. These are called \\"scarabaeiform\\" because it is the typical form of the larvae of the Scarabaeidae‚Äîthe scarab beetles and their relatives. In contrast, larvae of the Curculionidae ‚Äî the weevils ‚Äî are also called \\"apodous eruciform\\", (literally meaning legless caterpillar-shaped; unlike scarab larvae, they do not have legs). This seems rather inconsistent, because commonly weevil larvae are almost as C-shaped as scarab larvae. Larva of Oryctes nasicornis, Scarabaeidae Larva typical of the Curculionidae Variations and implications Some larvae, such as those of most beetles in the family Chrysomelidae, are described as eruciform, although they are short, have swollen abdomens, and have no true \\"prolegs\\" such as caterpillars have. Typically they walk freely on leaves and similar surfaces, using the \\"true\\" six legs on the three thoracic segments just behind the head. The abdomen is carried behind as a more or less swollen, hump-backed rear end. In contrast, larvae of the Cerambycidae (Longhorn beetles) are generally straight and could fairly be described as \\"apodous eruciform\\". They live in tunnels, typically in wood, where a distended abdomen would be a liability and legs are not the only option for locomotion. Instead of using legs Cerambycid larvae press fleshy bulges against the walls of their tunnels. Arguably the most typically eruciform larvae, prolegs and all, are to be found among the butterflies and moths (Lepidoptera), caddis larvae (Trichoptera), and sawflies (Symphyta)  References   External links  *Wiktionary *Bugguide.net Insect morphology Larvae ","title":"Eruciform"},{"id":"31262417","text":"This page consists of alternative versions of the Marvel Comics character Rogue a member of the X-Men. Age of Apocalypse In the Age of Apocalypse reality, Rogue is brought to Magneto and his X-Men for education in her powers by Mystique.X-Men Chronicles 01 (1995) Soon after this, Rogue would battle against Apocalypse's son Nemesis (who later became Holocaust) alongside the Scarlet Witch, and would witness the death of the latter. During the next few years, Rogue would express an attraction to both Gambit and the leader of the X-Men, Magneto. She would ultimately become romantically involved with Magneto after he worked out a way for them to touch by surrounding his body in a tight electromagnetic 'sheath' that prevented her from actually making contact with his skin while still feeling as though she was. The two would later conceive a son named Charles, after Charles Xavier, who was slain by Legion whose target had actually been Magneto himself. The Age of Apocalypse universe was later revealed to have been preserved due to the actions of Jean Grey. Rogue and Magneto, along with that reality's X-Men continue their lives.. This reality's version of Rogue had her uncontrollable absorption abilities, and permanently possessed around half of Polaris' magnetic abilities. Unlike her husband Magneto and Polaris herself, Rogue appeared to prefer to use these abilities to fly and augment her physical strength and durability to superhuman levels. Age of X Rogue appears in the Age of X continuity going by the name Legacy (also known as the Reaper). She is not allowed to be in the forefront of battles, but has the sole purpose of using her powers to absorb the memories and powers of dying mutants,X-Men Legacy #245 as well as those of Captain America after he sacrificed himself to save Fortress X from the Hulk.Age of X: Universe #2 She becomes curious when Kitty Pryde is caught getting back into the grounds and finds a camera- which, suspiciously, has several hundreds of blank photos. This results in her questioning everything and figures that she can get answers only from Kitty, who is imprisoned. She goes against orders and infiltrates the prison, coming across Blindfold and, later, Professor Xavier. After absorbing the Professor's powers, she realizes that everything is not what it seems to be.New Mutants #22 However, she cannot control his powers and unleashes a psychic attack on all mutants in the Fortress. Considered as a traitor, she is hunted by Moonstar and her team. She flees to Logan, who dresses her wounds. She confesses that she is puzzled by how she seems to know Charles Xavier but cannot figure out; at the same time, his memories paint a different picture of everything. Moonstar tracks her and she is shot down when fleeing. Gambit rescues her, but Magneto seemingly buries them under a pile of rubble for their \\"traitorous\\" actions.X-men Legacy #246 This was a ruse as Magneto himself was suspicious and was the individual who dispatched Kitty to take photos.New Mutants #23 Following information from Magneto, Rogue and Gambit break into a secret chamber and find that the culprit behind the alternative reality is Moira, an alternate persona of Legion.New Mutants #23 Amalgam Comics In the Amalgam Comics limited run, Rogue is combined with the DC Comics character Gypsy to form the new character Runaway.JLX #1 (April 1996) Exiles In the New Exiles series Rogue is from Earth-1009 and comes from a life of \\"wealth, privilege and sophistication.\\"Portfolio Review (promotion to New Exiles, published in Astonishing X-Men #23, January 2008) Apparently a master thief, she has a different personality from her Earth-616 version. She can absorb others' abilities and memories through her hands, but unlike the original Rogue, the rest of her body can be touched without ill-effects. Moreover, she can keep the borrowed powers and use them at will.New Exiles #16 (February 2009) In addition, she possesses super strength, durability, the ability to fly, the ability to disintegrate matter with a touch, and the ability to heal others wounds. Her bodysuit hides mysterious tattoos.New Exiles #10 (October 2008) House of M The House of M Rogue is an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. and part of the Red Guard, working with Wolverine, Mystique, Toad, Nightcrawler, and Jessica Drew. She plays an important role in the resistance to Magneto. After being contacted by the resistance movement, Rogue briefly touches Layla Miller and appears overwhelmed as the acquired power emanated from her and awakened others in the vicinity to the reality of the House. In the final battle, Rogue, finally able to unleash her powers to their full extent, tackles both Namor and Princess Ororo and absorbs their abilities, causing her to overflow with power. She even absorbed the powers of Genis-Vell. Due to the nature of Genis' genetics and powers, half of Rogue's body transforms into a seemingly window to a cosmic landscape of black void dotted with stars. During the end battle, Quicksilver finds the cosmically powered Rogue waiting up top. Pietro slams into Rogue and is sent flying back. Marvel 1602 A version of Rogue appears in the Marvel 1602 spin off \\"Angela: Witchunter\\". Marvel Noir Rogue appears in X-Men Noir as Anne-Marie Rankin, one of Professor Xavier's students. She has a talent for imitating the personality traits and mannerisms of any person, allowing her to fit into any situation. Professor Xavier considered her a missing link or patient zero in his theories about sociopathy as the next stage of human behavioral evolution.X-Men Noir #1-4 (February‚ÄìMay 2009) Marvel Zombies During the Ultimate Fantastic Four Crossover where the Ultimate universe's Fantastic Four visit the Marvel Zombies universe, Rogue is seen as a zombified hero in one of the panels before the infection spread out.Ultimate Fantastic Four #22 Mutant X In this darker reality, Rogue operates with a smaller X-Team consisting of Magneto, Nightcrawler, Polaris, Quicksilver, Cerebo, and a metallic-looking Mystique. Rogue herself maintains the steel and ridged skin of Colossus, having unintentionally absorbed his power when her glove disintegrated while she was trying to carry him to safety, and wears a version of Ms. Marvel's lightning bolt uniform. Prelude to Deadpool Corps In issue #2 Deadpool visits a world where Rogue and Jean Grey are orphaned kids at an orphanage run by Emma Frost. At a dance where Prof. X and Emma's orphans can have fun, Rogue can be seen calling Kidpool (kid version of Deadpool who attends Prof. X Orphanage for troubled kids) a dork. Professor W‚Äôs X-Men Rogue has defected from the X-Men in this series to join Cyclops' new Brotherhood of Evil Mutants. This drastic change in alliance can be partially attributed to the fact Rogue has fully absorbed the powers and life force of Super-Skrull, gaining his Skrull alien traits, the powers of all the members of the Fantastic Four, as well as Kl'rt's personality and memories. As a result of this absorption, Rogue's own personality has become warped, even regarded by her own teammates as acting villainous.Exiles #42 (April 2004) Ultimate Marvel In the Ultimate Marvel continuity, Rogue is first introduced in the story arc Return to Weapon XUltimate X-Men #7-12 (August 2001 ‚Äì January 2002) as a prisoner of Weapon X and she worked with Juggernaut and Nightcrawler. In this version, her name appears to be Marian Carlyle.Ultimate Comics X-Men #1 Her powers are exploited to steal sensitive information on the location and layout of The Xavier Institute for Gifted Children. Using this information, agents of Weapon X storm the school and capture the X-Men. Rogue is released along with the X-Men, Juggernaut, and Nightcrawler, when a combination of the Brotherhood of Mutant Supremacy and S.H.I.E.L.D rescues them and destroys Weapon X's facility. Though offered a place on the X-Men, she joins the Brotherhood. She later joins the X-Men in the Return of the King arc.Ultimate X-Men #27-33 (March‚ÄìJuly 2003) In the Cry Wolf arc,Ultimate X-Men #50-53 (October 2003 ‚Äì January 2004) the X-Men are attacked by Gambit who kidnaps Rogue and takes her to his employers, Andreas and Andrea von Strucker. They hope to use her powers for \\"corporate espionage\\". In exchange for her help, they promise her they will help her control her powers through a power-dampening material they had developed. She turns them down, feeling that her powers are her penance. Rebuked, they attack Rogue and Gambit. She touches both of them and uses their powers to fend off their guards. The X-Men arrive to take her back, but she turns them down and leaves with Gambit.Ultimate X-Men #53 (January 2004) Rogue does not appear again until Ultimate X-Men Annual #1, in which she and Gambit fight Juggernaut. Gambit sacrifices himself to save Rogue, and she kisses him as he dies at his request. With this kiss, she takes his powers that seemingly overwrite her own, ridding her of her 'death touch' through several of the books (this also affects Rogue's appearance, as she acquires black eyes with red irises). In the subsequent story arc Date Night,Ultimate X-Men #66-69 (March‚ÄìJune 2006) Rogue decides to rekindle her relationship with Iceman after she loses her virginity to him (something possible due to her being able to touch him now).Ultimate X-Men #66 (March 2006) During Ultimate X-Men Annual #2, Rogue speaks to Professor Xavier about her concerns regarding Gambit's powers still remaining. Xavier theorizes this is only a temporary change, and her powers will return within time. Towards the end of the annual, Rogue touches a delusional Nightcrawler and her old powers reemerge, causing her to start teleporting randomly, and she loses Gambit's power, sending her back into the shell of hiding her skin, much to her and Iceman's dismay.Ultimate X-Men Annual #2 During Ultimate X-Men #77, she loses her arm during a fight with Cable. However, after absorbing some of Wolverine's healing power, her arm appears to grow back.Ultimate X-Men #77 In Ultimate X-Men #80, Cyclops disbands the X-Men following Xavier's death. Rogue stays with Iceman at the Xavier Institute as a student. Xavier later returns and reveals himself to be alive. Rogue once again becomes an X-Man. At the end of Ultimate X-Men, a Banshee-enhanced Rogue is seen to be a member of Colossus' team. Her appearance heavily altered, it seems her abilities have been enhanced such that she can call on absorbed abilities, as she has Colossus' armored flesh and Angel's feathered wings extending from her arms. While telling Cyclops the benefits of Banshee she kisses him; when asked why, she replies \\"'Cause I can.\\"Ultimate X-Men #95 In Ultimate X-Men #95, she reveals that when her father got drunk he would molest her. Once when he tried to touch her, she took his life. She also appears to have found out who Vindicator was, but before she could elaborate, Vindicator took her out. Addicted to Banshee, Colossus' X-Men began to acquire more Banshee from the Acolytes. When they were discovered by the others, a battle raged. She absorbed Iceman's power and kissed him to show what Banshee could allow her, but the kiss was broken off by Firestar. Hostilities ceased when Northstar turns up ‚Äî alive, but crippled.Ultimate X-Men #97 After the Ultimatum Wave hits Manhattan, Jean refuses to allow Rogue to join her, as she cannot be trusted. Rogue then attacks Department H, absorbing Sasquatch's power and attacked Jubilee. It is then revealed that Vindicator is in fact John Wraith, whom she blames for ruining her life. She threatens him for help in killing Magneto. They travel to Montreal, where Rogue poses as a stripper to get close to Sabretooth and Juggernaut.Ultimate X-Men #98 (January 2009) The Purifiers soon attack the X-Mansion and Juggernaut dies fighting alongside Rogue. Rogue absorbs his powers just before he dies and now permanently possesses them. She then helps the X-Men in their effort to defeat Magneto and his Brotherhood. They do so, but suffer many casualties. Rogue is one of the few X-Men to survive to battle alongside Jean Grey, Iceman, Shadowcat, Storm, and Colossus. She is last seen helping Jean Grey and Iceman tear down the Xavier Institute and everything on the estate. They bury the remains of the deceased X-Men in its place.Ultimate X-Men: Requiem (September 2009) What If? In \\"What If the X-Men Stayed in Asgard\\", Rogue is one of the X-Men and New Mutants to remain in Asgard when she finds that her powers does not affect the Asgardians. She finally ends up falling in love with and marrying Fandral of the Warriors Three, whose place is subsequently taken by Nightcrawler.What If? vol.2 #12 In \\"What If Rogue possessed the power of Thor?\\", Rogue accidentally permanently absorbed Thor when she and Mystique attempted to break the Brotherhood out of prison, resulting in her killing most of The Avengers and the Brotherhood when she was unable to cope with Thor's power. Although Loki attempted to manipulate her into waging war on Asgard after she was able to lift Thor's hammer, the sight of Odin's genuine sense of loss allowed Thor's remnants to manifest in her subconscious, affirming that he was an ideal as well as a person, allowing Rogue to inherit his power and position as she became the new Thor.What If (vol.2 )#66 In \\"What If Mystique had raised Nightcrawler?\\", Rogue's attempt to free Nightcrawler from the attic where Mystique had kept him to 'protect' him resulted in him being mortally injured by the Brotherhood when they mistook him for an X-Man, Rogue's attempt to use his power to escape resulting in her permanently absorbing Nightcrawler's powers and appearance due to the prolonged contact she maintained.What If (vol.2) #98 In What If? Volume 2 #114, the heroes taken to the Beyonder's battleworld never returned to Earth. In this reality, Rogue is called Carol, implying that the absorbed Ms. Marvel persona is the dominant consciousness. Because Carol is in control, Rogue's absorption powers are under control, and she is married to Captain America. They also have a daughter together named Sarah, who inherited some of her mother's abilities and is known as Crusader. This version of Rogue appears to have her original mutant powers as well as Ms. Marvel's powers. It was also shown that she wears Ms. Marvel's costume into battle. In the What If? story \\"Bullet Points\\", in which a single bullet changed the history of Bruce Banner, Peter Parker, Anthony Stark, and Steven Rogers, Rogue is seen alongside the X-Men of this reality, and appears in her iconic costume. She presumably has the same history as her mainstream counterpart, and possesses both her own mutant abilities and the powers of Ms. Marvel. She later assists her teammates and many other heroes and villains against Galactus, and watches as the Silver Surfer dies to protect the Earth from being devoured. In the \\"What If Xavier's Secret Second Team had Survived Krakoa\\" storyline, Rogue is seen as a member of Vulcan's X-Men. She seems to possess both her own mutant abilities as well as the powers of Ms. Marvel, as she is seen flying and wearing gloves. Her history is presumably the same as her mainstream counterpart, though she wears a blue uniform and yellow gloves rather than her iconic costume. X-Men: The End In an alternative future featured in the series X-Men: The End, Rogue and Gambit are married and have two children named Olivier and Rebecca \\"Becca\\" LeBeau. Rogue has also gained complete control over her abilities in this timeline. This Rogue defeats Shaitan and rescues her children from the Neverland Camp, but was ultimately killed by Mister Sinister when he was disguised as Gambit. X-Men Forever In this reality, Rogue has absorbed Nightcrawler's abilities when he gave her mouth-to-mouth, granting her Nightcrawler's skin and tail as well as exceptional athletic abilities, although this has also left Nightcrawler with Rogue's powers and looking like a normal human. Claremont has kept the plot thread from Fall of the Mutants concerning the X-Men's encounter with Roma intact, and so Rogue is still rendered undetectable to cameras, appearing only as a blur on screen or film. While exploring her new powers, Rogue runs into Spider-Man and spends the night fighting crime alongside him; she suggests that they kiss to see if her original abilities have been affected by her transformation, but they are interrupted by a Sentinel attack before they can actually make contact.X-Men Forever (vol. 2) #3 (September 2010)  Uncanny Avengers  In the Age of Ultron storyline, Rogue and Havok are a married couple, leading the Morlocks. Captain America approaches them in the tunnels with the intent of escorting Caliban for a trial. However, the meeting is interrupted by the Apocalypse Twins who are on a mission to kill Captain America. In the end, they kill Havok (when he defends Captain America) and Rogue (when she retaliates for Havok's death).Uncanny Avengers #8 AU References Fictional characters from parallel universes ","title":"Alternative versions of Rogue"},{"id":"31262483","text":"Schematic of wiring an induction regulator. Power source is connected to R-S-T rotor terminals. Output voltage is N+1-2-3 terminals. Diagram of electrical phasors for an induction regulator An induction regulator is an alternating current electrical machine, somewhat similar to an induction motor, which can provide a continuously variable output voltage. The induction regulator was an early device used to control the voltage of electric networks. Since the 1930s it has been replaced in distribution network applications by the tap transformer. Its usage is now mostly confined to electrical laboratories, electrochemical processes and arc welding. With minor variations, its setup can be used as a phase-shifting power transformer. Construction A single- phase induction regulator has a (primary) excitation winding, connected to the supply voltage, wound on a magnetic core which can be rotated. The stationary secondary winding is connected in series with the circuit to be regulated. As the excitation winding is rotated through 180 degrees, the voltage induced in the series winding changes from adding to the supply voltage to opposing it. By selection of the ratios of the number of turns on the excitation and series windings, the range of voltage can be adjusted, say, plus or minus 20% of the supply voltage, for example. The three phase induction regulator can be regarded as a wound induction motor. The rotor is not allowed to turn freely and it can be mechanically shifted by means of a worm gear. The rest of the regulator's construction follows that of a wound rotor induction motor with a slotted three-phase stator and a wound three-phase rotor. Since the rotor is not allowed to turn more than 180 degrees, mechanically, the rotor leads can be connected by flexible cables to the exterior circuit. If the stator winding is a two-pole winding, moving the rotor through 180 degrees physically will change the phase of the induced voltage by 180 degrees. A four-pole winding only requires 90 degrees of physical movement to produce 180 degrees of phase shift. Since a torque is produced by the interaction of the magnetic fields, the movable element is held by a mechanism such as a worm gear. The rotor may be rotated by a hand wheel attached to the machine, or an electric motor can be used to remotely or automatically adjust the rotor position. Depending on the application, the ratio of number of turns on the rotor and the stator can vary. Working Since the single phase regulator only changes the flux linking the excitation and series windings, it does not introduce a phase shift between the supply voltage and the load voltage. However, the varying position of the movable element in the three-phase regulator does create a phase shift. This may be a concern if the load circuit may be connected to more than one supply, since circulating currents will flow owing to the phase shift. If the rotor terminals are connected to a three-phase electric power network, a rotating magnetic field will be driven into the magnetic core. The resulting flux will produce an emf on the windings of the stator with the particularity that if rotor and stator are physically shifted by an angle Œ±, then the electric phase shifting of both windings is Œ± too. Considering just the fundamental harmonic, and ignoring the shifting, the following equation rules: :frac{U_{stator}}{U_{rotor}}=frac{xi_{stator} N_{stator}}{xi_{rotor} N_{rotor}} Where Œæ is the winding factor, a constant related to the construction of the windings. If the stator winding is connected to the primary phase, the total voltage seen from the neutral (N) will be the sum of the voltages at both windings rotor and stator. Translating this to electric phasors, both phasors are connected. However, there is an angular shifting of Œ± between them. Since Œ± can be freely chosen between [0, œÄ], both phasors can be added or subtracted, so all the values in between are attainable. The primary and secondary are not isolated. Also, the ratio of the magnitudes of voltages between rotor and stator is constant; the resultant voltage varies owing to the angular shifting of the series winding induced voltage. Advantages The output voltage can be continuously regulated within the nominal range. This is a clear benefit against tap transformers where output voltage takes discrete values. Also, the voltage can be easily regulated under working conditions. Drawbacks In comparison to tap transformers, induction regulators are expensive, with lower efficiency, high open circuit currents (due to the airgap) and limited in voltage to less than 20kV. Applications An induction regulator for power networks is usually designed to have a nominal voltage of 14kV and ¬±(10-15)% of regulation, but this use has declined. Nowadays, its main uses are in electrical laboratories and arc welding.

The season concluded after its eighteenth episode on December 15, 2011.  Season overview  Six months after the arrest of Vaughn and the retrieval of the NOC list, Michael has been working with the CIA to capture, imprison, or execute all of the people that worked for the organization that burned him. With only one high-ranking operative remaining, Michael, his boss Raines (Dylan Baker), and partner Max (Grant Show) attempt to extract the final spy, but he commits suicide rather than face the CIA. Having to return to Miami before being reinstated, Michael struggles with civilian life, constantly checking and re- checking inconsistencies in the documents on Management. In the fourth episode of the season \\"No Good Deed\\", Michael and Max work to steal a piece of stolen information and bring it back to the CIA. When Michael shows up to the de- brief, he discovers Max bleeding out on the floor, shot by what is likely the murder weapon beside him. Hearing gunfire, he picks up the weapon and attempts to chase down the murderer, who escapes unidentified. Michael covers his tracks, and the murderer's, before escaping. Michael's suspicions about being framed for the murder are confirmed when Sam discovers a newly opened box of ammunition that matches the murder weapon in the car Michael used to drive to the building. Destroying the weapon, Michael and his team run their own investigation parallel to Agent Dani Pearce (Lauren Stamile), the lead investigator for the CIA. Tracking them through the imposter used to pose as Michael, they find that an extremely complex bomb was prepared to kill him; the intricacies of the bomb lead them to a Romanian war criminal who created the bomb for an old friend, Tavian Korzha (Andrew Howard). Tracking Korzha to his warehouse they catch a glimpse of him but he escapes. Using data from Korzha's computers they locate the source of his funds, which also allows for them to attempt an ambush, which he anticipates and kidnaps Sam, demanding a meet with Michael. While he insists on only that time and place, Jesse's NSA and FBI connections lock down the island for the meet, forcing him to stay. However, Michael, reentering his loft after a CIA extraction mission, encounters Agent Pearce, who has found proof of a Charger leaving the scene of Max's murder, enough proof to convince her that Michael was the killer, arresting him at gunpoint. Sam and Jesse intercept the CIA convoy, convincing Pearce to let Michael meet Korzha. While wearing a wire, Michael gets Korzha to confess to the frame and murder, but Korzha kills himself to avoid further interrogation. Michael is exonerated and debriefed. Upon his return, Michael is kidnapped by Larry Sizemore (Tim Matheson), who has also kidnapped DIA psychiatrist Anson Fullerton (Jere Burns). Using Anson as leverage, Larry forces Michael to help him break into a British consulate and steal information. While Michael's team is able to foil Larry's plot and presumably kill him, the explosives used chain-react with a series of others, inadvertently making Fiona responsible for two other deaths. Her confession was recorded by Fullerton, who is revealed as the final member of the organization that burned Michael. He claims that the organization was started by him and Management and their intentions were initially simple: get burned spies to carry out questionable missions that would never get through the red tape at intelligence agencies. Fullerton uses the information on Fiona as leverage, forcing Michael to work under the organization once again. The reason for Anson's intervention is to assign Michael the task of traveling to Puerto Rico to locate a hacker who had developed a software that will help Anson erase any known information the CIA may have on him and his organization. While Michael does delete the information after obtaining the necessary virus, he tries to find some leverage of his own. The team manage to track Anson to a military-encrypted radio. This leads the team to Benny, Madeline's boyfriend who is also Anson's spy. However Anson is one step ahead and blows up Benny before they can get any useful information. Anson then forces Jesse and Fiona to go to the Cayman Islands and retrieve his money. Through Agent Harris, Sam then manages to get a meeting with the FBI deputy director, planning to take down Anson. But the team needs to use Anson to help Beatriz, which provides Anson the opportunity to stop Sam. He gets the meeting called off and Sam investigated as a possible Russian agent by including him in the report that stopped the Russian spy from murdering Beatriz. This is shortly after Anson reveals to Michael that he had met, and acted as a psychiatrist to Michael's father, and due to his father's suspicions, caused the heart attack that killed Frank Westen. Through files obtained through a Washington, D.C. law firm, Michael discovers a connection to his one time \\"handler\\" Vaughn Anderson, formerly with Anson's organization (and arrested in the Season 4 finale). Through Agent Pearce, Michael arranges a meet with Vaughn in a prison camp, where he discovers the truth behind Fullerton's actions. Michael had hoped that Anson might simply flee the country after wiping out his connections to the organization and retrieving his frozen money. But Vaughn assures Michael: using the infrastructures already in place, Anson is not retiring, but is re-building the organization from the ground up, along with help from the unwilling Michael Westen. When the CIA allows Michael to run an operation with an authorized team, Anson takes the opportunity to force Michael to burn the team and Pearce to provide a front line of operatives for his new organization. While Fiona is not willing to accept her freedom over theirs, Michael is adamant that the situation can be redeemed without compromising Fiona. When Anson's mole on the team is uncovered by Michael, he quickly improvises a plan to extract their target and instructs Jesse to remove the framing evidence. When Michael returns home from the mission, however, he discovers Fiona has left to turn herself in and remove Anson's leverage over Michael. Michael arrives at the Federal Building just as Fiona is being arrested.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building, and is under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. The church stands near the end of a road to the north of Lower Higham, some northwest of Rochester. Early history St Mary's was founded in the Saxon era, and a church was in existence on the site before the Norman Conquest. The present church was rebuilt after the Conquest, and it still contains some Norman features, despite later additions and alterations. During the 12th century a nunnery was founded nearby, and in about 1280 it moved to a site opposite the church. In 1357 the nunnery received a papal indulgence to raise money for repairs. It is thought likely that this was used to build a new south aisle for the church, which is as large as the original nave. The nunnery was closed in 1522. In 1710 the spire was built. The church was repaired and restored in the early part of the 19th century. The south porch was built during the 19th century. In 1863 the church was restored by an architect with the surname of Speechly, and new furniture was installed. The windows were replaced \\"copying what was there before\\". However, by the middle of the century the centre of Higham's population had moved away from the area of St Mary's, and a new church, dedicated to St John, was built nearer to the railway station and the main road in 1862. Architecture =Exterior= The church is constructed in a mixture of flint and ragstone, the flint being arranged to give the appearance of horizontal stripes. A buttress at the southeast corner includes some galletting (where slivers of flint have been pushed into the mortar), and other buttresses have tiles inserted between the stones. The roof is tiled, and the spire is shingled. The plan of the church consists of a nave and a south aisle of almost equal size. At the east end of the nave is the Lady Chapel, which had been the chancel of the original church. The present chancel is at the east end of the south aisle. The nave also contains two small rooms, the larger one acting as the vestry, the other being entered only from the outside of the church. The north wall contains Norman features, a blocked window and the outline of a doorway. =Interior= The church is entered by the 15th-century south door which is finely carved with motifs including roses, lilies and human faces. Between the nave and the aisle is a three-bay arcade. Dividing the nave from the Lady Chapel is a wooden 15th-century rood screen. This is carved and has five arches, the central one forming the doorway. Between the arches are columns, each of which is surmounted by a small spire. The carved wooden pulpit dates from the same era. The font is Norman, and the rest of the furniture dates from the 1863 restoration. The Lady Chapel contains two tombs, one of which is dated 1615, and an aumbry complete with its door. In the south wall of the chancel is a piscina and a medieval tomb. On the wall on each side of the altar are panels inscribed with the Ten Commandments, the Lord's Prayer, and the Creed. The stained glass dates from the 19th and 20th centuries. Recent history and present day Further repairs were carried out to the roof and spire of St Mary's during the 20th century. After the church was declared redundant, it was vested in the Redundant Churches Fund, the forerunner of the Churches Conservation Trust, in 1987. In the same year St Mary's was replaced as the parish church by St John's Church. During the 21st century, further repairs to the stonework of the south aisle, porch and east end have been organised by the Trust. In the wall of the south aisle, the external flintwork has become separated from the core of the wall, and work has been undertaken to pin the two together. In early 2009 a group known as The Friends of St. Mary's Church was founded to work with the Trust, to raise money for the church, and to organise events.

They were built over a 20-year period around the end of the 19th century, when Waterbury was a prosperous, growing industrial center. In 1983 they were recognized as a historic district and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Among the four is a rare Queen Anne Style commercial building, and one of the only three Richardsonian Romanesque commercial buildings in the city. Some of Waterbury's leading architects of the time were among the designers. The four have remained intact even as later, modern development interceded between them and the contemporary buildings elsewhere downtown. Buildings The four buildings and their respective lots occupy an area of a quarter-acre, or a thousand square meters, most of which is covered by their footprints, at 207‚Äì231 Bank Street. This is on the east side of Bank between Grand Street and the Interstate 84 viaduct. The terrain slopes slightly to the south. The neighborhood is densely developed and urban. A large modern commercial block is across the street. Driveways on the north and south give access to parking lots behind the buildings and separate the row from other modern buildings. At the ends of the block small rows of trees buffer both Grand and the interstate. To the northeast is a small park at Grand and South Main Street. The Bank and Grand intersection is the southeast corner of the much larger Downtown Waterbury Historic District, with a concentration of buildings from the same era as the Bank Street buildings. A block to the west are the five public and private buildings, including City Hall, originally designed by Cass Gilbert as the Waterbury Municipal Center Complex. All four buildings are at least four stories high. Three are faced in brick, and one in brownstone, with glass storefronts at street level. Small trees are planted at intervals along with sidewalk. They are all considered contributing properties. =Pritchard Building= The northernmost of the four is at 207‚Äì211 Bank Street. This four- story building is the only one of the four to have its west (front) facade in brownstone, done in a rough surface with granite trim, per its Richardsonian Romanesque styling. A main entrance is centrally located between two storefronts; it is topped by two iron plates with rosettes. All upper levels are fenestrated with two bays of paired windows, quoined at the sides, in modern one-over-one double-hung sash. The first and second stories are set off by heavy brownstone lintels; the third and fourth divided by a checkerboard pattern of small alternating granite and brownstone blocks. The second and third stories also have small terra cotta moldings below. At the fourth story the rounded windows are topped with banded segmental arches. A parapet with two tiers of recessed panels is at the roofline. At either end are small pyramidal towers with crocket finials. The interior has been extensively renovated but some original wainscoting and window trim is left on the third floor. =Whittemore Building= The Whittemore is the next building south of the Pritchard, at 213‚Äì219 Bank Street. The last of the four built, it is a four-story Georgian Revival brick building. At the four-bay facade's street level are two storefronts, with entrances in the middle and at the south. Original cast iron pilasters with a curving, interlaced motif support a modillioned cornice of the same material. Above, all three stories have a similar treatment. The middle two windows are wider than those on the ends. All have molded limestone sills and splayed lintels with prominent keyblocks. They are filled with eight-over-one double-hung sash; the three-part center windows have four-over-one on the sides. A continuous modillioned cornice forms the sill of the fourth-story windows. Raised brickwork at the corners suggests quoins. At the top of the facade is an entablature with a wide dentilled and modillioned frieze below a molded overhanging cornice. Inside, the interiors are continuous with the Pritchard Building. Molded window frames on the upper floors are the only original interior finishes remaining. =Griggs Building= At 221‚Äì227 Bank is the Griggs Building, the largest and most ornate of the four. A steeply pitched hipped roof gives this a fifth story. That feature, its generally irregular juxtapositions of shapes and forms and its heavily decorated facade mark it as a rare commercial application of the Queen Anne Style, much more commonly used for houses during its peak period in the late 19th century. On the ground floor, much of the Griggs' original cast iron storefront remains. Ionic pilasters with fluted necks and intricately carved panels with a foliate motif above the middle support a stone lintel. The northernmost pilaster also includes the monogram of the building's original owner. The entrances themselves are topped by arched transoms with fans carved in the spandrels. A cornice with egg and dart molding above the lintel further sets off the upper stories. The facade has, on the next three stories, a group of three windows on either side of a slightly recessed central bay blind except for a large terra cotta tablet on the second story with the inscription \\"Griggs Building\\". Above it, on the third story, is another tablet with the date of construction, 1884, in a frame topped by a pediment. Corinthian pilasters divide the windows on all three stories, supporting a plain entablature running across all three. Below the third- and fourth-story windows are terra cotta panels with a festoon carving in the middle surrounded by bead and reel, a motif that continues in the pilaster capitals. The lintels have an unusual ogee curve on their lower edge. All upper-story windows are one-over-one sash with stained glass border panes in the upper section. The fourth story's round-arched windows have an otherwise similar treatment with some differences in detailing. The panels below are more detailed than their third story counterparts, with a spiral foliate decoration at the center and owls at the sides. The pilasters are similar, with a stringcourse of dentils at the impost line and hood molds over the arches. These break the main cornice, along with the brick piers at the corners and center bay. The windows themselves have stained glass border panes in the upper section. From large foot scrolls on the arch tops spring the three pilasters that frame the two recessed 16-pane windows in each of the gabled dormers that pierce the roof, finished in fish-scale slate. Similar large stone scrolls form the sides of the dormers. The pilasters support a denticulated cornice, creating a pediment with an elaborate carved vine pattern. Crowning the house are brick chimneys rising above the roof from both ends, continuing the side wall. As with the other buildings, the interior has been heavily renovated over time and most of the original finishes that remain are in the upper stories. Two skylit staircases, with turned balusters and newels and a curved molded handrail rise to the upper story in the front and rear. Off them, the hallways have simple wainscoting. Fireplaces in the front rooms have a mix of classical, Italianate and Eastlake decorative touches. =Republican Building= The southernmost of the group at 229‚Äì231 Bank Street, the Republican is named after one of Waterbury's daily newspapers at the time, one of the papers that merged to form the present-day Republican- American, which used it as an office. It is the shortest of the buildings, faced in brick at three and a half stories tall, four bays wide, in an eclectic mix of styles. Today its ground floor is home to the popular Diorio restaurant. Its modern storefront features fluted and paneled pilasters around the main entrance and a lintel with applied geometric designs. Both stories above it have nine-over-one double-hung sash between granite sills and lintels in all four bays. In the center of the third story is a three-part semicircular window set in a splayed-brick arch, its middle section two-over- two sash. The restrained facade is countered by a decorative peaked parapet above the semicircular window. It starts with a band of terra cotta panels in alternating circular and foliate motifs between sawtooth brick courses. Above them is a corbeled tier, with similar features serving as end brackets. Inside, the building mostly serves as the restaurant and offices. The ground floor has been extensively remodeled to that use. Its pressed-metal ceiling is original, as are the turned balusters on the stairway. History In the 1880s Bank Street south of Grand was undeveloped, a de facto buffer between the industrial areas to the south and the commercial and civic core of downtown to the north. Some of Waterbury's wealthier citizens owned the lots, intending to build large houses. The city's growth made them realize that downtown would continue to expand and that the lots would be better developed as commercial property. They built houses instead in the Hill neighborhood. Henry C. Griggs, cofounder of the Smith and Griggs Manufacturing Company and a two-term member of the Connecticut General Assembly, which made small items like corset fasteners from the brass the city produced in great abundance, sold part of his lot to Republican editor J. Henry Morrow in 1883. Morrow built the building, the first of the four now in the district, to accommodate not only the paper's printing presses and editorial offices but its printing business. Stylistically it reflects different influences of the time. The corbelling and terra cotta panels are typical Victorian decorations, while the fanlight and fenestration anticipate the Colonial Revival style by a few decades. The following year Griggs developed his remaining property. He hired Robert W. Hill, a former student of Henry Austin who was one of Waterbury's most accomplished architects of the time, with many public buildings around Connecticut to his credit. Hill's building for Griggs was a rare use of the Queen Anne style in a commercial building. The varied surfaces, rich decoration and mixture of curved and rectilinear mark it as particularly high in that style. Also in 1884, the Pritchard family developed its lot to the north. They hired Joseph A. Jackson, the son of an Irish immigrant carpenter who had studied under Hill and become another of Waterbury's leading architects. The rough stone facing and round arches are typical of the Romanesque Revival style popular at the time, as interpreted by Henry Hobson Richardson. Griggs had apparently hoped the building would be among the most desirable locations in Waterbury, but he was never able to attract that kind of tenant. Shortly after it opened, the Franklin Hotel moved in from a few blocks away. At the ground level it was home to a piano tuner, photographer's studio and billiards parlor. Next door, the Republican moved out in 1896. Morrow continued to rent the building, and it eventually acquired his name. The Pritchards sold their building in 1901. John Whittemore, the new owner, was another successful Waterbury industrialist who dabbled in real estate. In 1904, he added the south wing, designed by Henry Griggs' son Walter, who by then was also a part-owner of his father's building to the south. He had become one of the city's most accomplished architects, later to build such downtown landmarks as the nearby county courthouse, the Elton Hotel and the Lilley Building, Waterbury's first steel frame commercial structure. The Georgian Revival structure he designed for his neighbor is an exemplary modest commercial effort, with its brick facing, small-pane windows and classically inspired cornice typifying a style he did not usually work in. Later a northern addition, since demolished, was built. The entire building was known and rented as the Pritchard Block. Diorio's Restaurant was established in the Republican/Morrow Building in the early 1920s. During the entire 1980s, it was closed and restored to its original appearance from that time. At the time the district was listed on the Register in the early 1980s, a billboard was on the outside of the fourth floor of the Griggs building; it has since been removed.

Production history The ED4 was designed to accommodate Russia's need for a domestically produced electric train-set. Russia's most widely exploited electric trains, the ER1 and ER2 series, were produced by the Rƒ´gas Vagonb≈´ves R≈´pnƒ´ca (RVR) plant in Latvia before the collapse of the USSR. Design work began in 1996 on the basis of the earlier ED2 series, which were largely equipped with RVR components. Electronic equipment for the new train was manufactured by The Novocherkassk Electric Locomotive Plant, while the drive-train was built in Novosibirsk. ED4 train-cars are nearly identical to those used by both the ER29, and ED2T trains, differing mainly in having notably wider doors. After successfully completing testing, the first train entered service at the Mineralnye Vody Depot of the North Caucasus Railway. Only 5 trains carry the early ED4 identification, as the second variant, ED4M, began exclusive production thereafter. The main difference between the two trains is the equipment and shape of the operator's compartment.

Oilpainting by her husband David Wallin (1876‚Äì1957). Elin Kristina Wallin, born on December 29, 1884 in Gothenburg, died March 25, 1969 in Stockholm, was a Swedish artist and drawer. She was the wife of the Swedish artist David Wallin. Elin Wallin grew up in Ekersgatan 13 in √ñrebro. She was the daughter of an elementary school teacher, Viktor Lundberg, and his wife Anna Lundberg, born Kalling, √ñrebro, and sister to the damask weaver Carl WidlundDamastv√§varen Carl Widlund (The Damask Weaver Carl Widlund) and sister to Hilda Sofia (Hild) Zetterlind-Simonsen. She was the mother of the artist Bianca Wallin (1909‚Äì2006) and of the artist Sigurd Wallin (1916‚Äì1999). Biography Althins m√•larskola (Caleb Althin's school of painting) in Stockholm. Photo from 1903. 4th from the right is Elin Wallin, born Lundberg (1884‚Äì1969). When she had left the girls' school in √ñrebro Elin Wallin went to evening courses at the Technical school in √ñrebro in 1901 and 1902. In 1902 she passed the examination as a needlework mistress at Hulda Lundin's seminary in Stockholm and after that she continued her studies in 1902‚Äì1904 at Althins m√•larskola. Caleb Althin was the founder of Althin's school of painting, a private art school on Grevgatan 26 in √ñstermalm in Stockholm. For several decades the school played an important role in preparing young artists for the Academy of Arts. During the years 1902‚Äì1904 Wallin studied in the evenings at the University College of Arts, Crafts and Design (in Swedish simply known as Konstfack) in Stockholm. Konstfack, sometimes also called Tekniska skolan, was at that time in the block of Beridarebanan in Norrmalm, between Klara kyrka and H√∂torget. During two periods, in 1905‚Äì1906 and 1910‚Äì1911, she studied at the Acad√©mie Colarossi in Paris. The Acad√©mie Colarossi accepted female students and allowed them to draw from the nude male model. Colarossi was as an alternative to the government-sanctioned √âcole des Beaux Arts that had, in the eyes of many promising young artists at the time, become far too conservative. Together with her husband David Wallin she travelled for study to London in 1905, Paris 1905‚Äì1906 and 1910‚Äì1911, Italy 1908‚Äì1910, Germany 1905, 1906 and 1908, Denmark 1908. Most of Elin Wallin's work was created during the years 1902‚Äì1919. She was mainly occupied with portraits in oil, pencil and tempera, as well as drawing and painting flowers and landscapes in oil, watercolor, pencil and charcoal. Wallin's art can, by sheer radiant colors display relations to David Wallin. The landscapes and portraits of her husband, one senses perhaps more reminiscent of French impressionism. Mostly, however, her paintings carries her own mark, especially the children portraits with their bright color touches. In bright memories she tries to cling to elements of their seven children, of whom she lost two in a very early age. There are pictures from a family album, with no claim to universality, but right in the humble plea to heart. Wallin has also appeared with illustrations in magazines. Family and personal life Sankt Nikolai church, √ñrebro. Elin Wallin was only 20 years old when she married David Wallin, 29 years old, on September 14, 1905.

The newly married husband David had an exhibition in √ñrebro in the same week as the wedding. It was one of the first exhibitions that David ever had. After the wedding they went on honeymoon to Paris and London. David painted a couple of small paintings with Elin in the Luxembourg Gardens in Paris. The couple settled in Stockholm and Elin and David became parents of seven children, born in 1906, 1907, 1909, 1912, 1916, 1922 and 1924, five girls and two boys.Vem √§r vem? Stockholmsdelen 1945, page 925, David Wallin and his family. The two oldest girls were born in Sweden, Helena and Hillevi. Their daughter Bianca was born in Rome in Italy in 1909. Their fourth daughter, Dagny, was born in Paris in 1912. In 1908, David Wallin was awarded an Royal Swedish Academy of Arts travel scholarship, which was later extended for another year. The following year he received another award. The awards allowed him to live in Italy, and then in France during the period 1908‚Äì1913 with his whole family. During the years 1908‚Äì1910 the family stayed in Rome at Lehmanns boarding-house, which was owned by Mrs. Lehmann in Via Frattina. During the summers David stayed in Volterra, southwest of Florence, where there was a colony of artists. During the years 1910‚Äì1913 the family stayed in Paris at 43 Rue de l‚ÄôAbb√© Gr√©goireRue de l‚ÄôAbb√© Gr√©goire, Paris in Montparnasse-Luxembourg. During their time in Paris the family Wallin got to know some other Swedish artists including the sculptor Gottfrid Larsson (1875‚Äì1936) with wife Karen Larsson (born Waaler), who were staying in Paris in 1908‚Äì1913, and the artist and photographer Erik Tryggelin (1879‚Äì1962).Erik Tryggelin in Konstn√§rslexikonett AmandaErik Tryggelin in Artnet In the autumn 1913 the family moved back to Sweden and Stockholm. When the fifth child came it was finally a boy, Sigurd, and happiness seemed complete. But, there was heavy grief of the family, two girls, Hillevi and Dagny, died in a drowning accident in the summer of 1919. Of course the family was affected much by this. Elin did not continue to paint. David painted many melancholy motifs of mother and child, deeply influenced by his grief. After a few years the family was extended again with two children, a girl and a boy. From 1913, the family lived in Hj√§rnegatan 10 in Kungsholmen, and in 1928 the family could move into a large apartment in √ñstermalm, Karlav√§gen 43, overlooking Humleg√•rden. Now David was close to his artist work-rooms, located just across the Humleg√•rden. The atelier, his studio with workroom, was on the upper top floor and had sloping roof windows on Humleg√•rdsgatan 23 in Stockholm with a view over the (National Library of Sweden), Kungliga biblioteket, KB. The atelier, he had it already in autumn of 1904, was rented out during the years when the family lived in Rome and Paris, and it was his workplace for over 50 years.

The acronym WORHP is sometimes spelled out as \\"We Optimize Really Huge Problems\\", its primary intended application. WORHP is a hybrid Fortran and C implementation and can be used from C/C++ and Fortran programs using different interfaces of varying complexity and flexibility. In addition interfaces for the modelling environments MATLAB, CasADi and AMPL exist.  Problem formulation  WORHP is designed to solve problems of the form ::: min_{x in R^n} f(x) :subject to ::: L leq begin{pmatrix} x  g(x) end{pmatrix} leq U with sufficiently smooth functions f:R^n to R (objective) and g:R^n to R^m (constraints) that may be nonlinear, and need not necessarily be convex. Even problems with large dimensions n and m can be solved efficiently, if the problem is sufficiently sparse. Cases where objective and constraints cannot be evaluated separately, or where constraints can be evaluated element-wise can be exploited by WORHP to increase the computational efficiency. = Derivatives = WORHP requires the first derivative (Gradient) of f and of g (Jacobian) and second derivatives (Hessian matrix) of the Lagrange function; in a modelling environment like AMPL, these are provided by automatic differentiation methods, but need to be provided by the caller in other environments. First and second derivatives can be approximated by WORHP using finite differences. To reduce the otherwise prohibitively high number of necessary function evaluations in large scale sparse problems, graph colouring theory is used to group first and second partial derivatives. Second derivatives may also be approximated using variations of the classic BFGS method, including block- diagonal or sparse BFGS matrices.  Structure  The NLP level of WORHP is based on SQP, while the quadratic subproblems are solved using an interior point method. This approach was chosen to benefit from the robustness of SQP methods and the reliable runtime complexity of IP methods, since traditional active set methods may be unsuitable for large-scale problems.  Development  Development of WORHP started in 2006 with funding from DLR and was continued under the eNLP label after 2008 with support by ESA / ESTEC together with the Interior-Point solver ipfilter (whose inclusion in eNLP was discontinued after 2010) to develop a European NLP solver for use in trajectory optimisation, mission analysis and aerospace applications in general. The development of WORHP is led by the Steinbeis-Forschungszentrum Optimierung, Steuerung und Regelung and scientists of the Optimization and Optimal Control Group at the University of Bremen, and at the Bundeswehr University of Munich. The developers stress that WORHP, despite its academic roots, is intended as industrial-grade tool rather than an academic research platform.  Applications  WORHP has been integrated into trajectory analysis tools such as LOTNAV and ASTOS, and is being used at ESOC and ESTEC. It can be used as optimiser in CasADi (since version 1.5.0beta) and as local optimiser in SVAGO MDO tool developed at University of Bremen and Politecnico di Milano on Multidisciplinary design optimization through the ESA PRESTIGE program.

She was also a fervent supporter of voting reform and the Equal Rights Amendment. Life and career Born in Des Moines, Iowa, to David Clinton Kellems and Amanda Louise (n√©e Flint), Kellems received a BA from the University of Oregon in 1918, where she became the only woman on the debate team. She went on to earn a master's degree in economics, and worked towards a PhD at Columbia University and the University of Edinburgh.

Tax resistance In 1948, Kellems refused to collect withholding taxes from her employees on behalf of the government, stating, \\"If they wanted me to be their agent, they'd have to pay me, and I want a badge.\\" She was interviewed about her tax opposition on \\"Meet the Press\\" on September 26, 1948, at a time when women rarely appeared on the show. She has described herself in her book Toil, Taxes and Trouble.On the Kellems case, see Vivien Kellems, Toil, Taxes and Trouble (New York: E. P.

Archived from https://mises.org/ She surrendered her case when her continued pursuit of it threatened to bankrupt her company. She continued to challenge that and other aspects of the income tax for the rest of her life, saying in a 1975 Los Angeles Times interview, \\"Our tax law is a 1,598-page hydra-headed monster and I'm going to attack and attack and attack until I have ironed out every fault in it.\\" From 1965 until her death, Kellems reportedly sent only blank returns to the Internal Revenue Service. Her stands against the income tax system have made Kellems an admired figure in the tax protester movement.Gross, David (ed.) We Won't Pay!: A Tax Resistance Reader pp. 419-428. In April 1951, the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut ruled that Kellems was entitled to a refund of income taxes assessed against her employees for which the government had been overpaid (that is, the tax had been collected from both the employees and Kellems).Kellems v. United States, 97 F. Supp. 681 (D. Conn. 1951). The Court also ruled that Kellems and her co-plaintiff David Kellems were not entitled to a refund of penalties they had paid on account of their refusal to withhold taxes, as the Kellems were unable to show that their refusal was with reasonable cause under the law.Id.

It was constructed by Buck Owens, and was opened in 1996. Primarily it is a performance venue for country western music, although other music genres have been heard there. It is also the home of the Buck Owens Museum, which contains items related to his career (some of the items are also available for viewing online).Museum . Buck Owens Crystal Palace. Accessed: 03-22-2011. Although it is classified in this article as a music hall, it is also a nightclub, bar, restaurant, and museum. The Crystal Palace is designed in the Western Revival style, a style that resembles buildings from the 19th-century American Old West. The interior resembles an American western town from that same period. The museum is located in display cases around the first floor, which resemble the windows to the building. History The idea for the Buck Owens Crystal Palace originated in the mid-1980s. Buck spent most of his early career performing in small, smoke-filled bars and ‚Äúhonky-tonks‚Äù around the country. He wanted a high-class place for country-western music to be performed. Buck also wanted a place where he could be himself.Roland, Tom. Buck Owens' Legacy Continues at Crystal Palace. CMT. September 14, 2007. Accessed: 03-22-2011. Construction started in the mid-1990s. Buck was closely involved with the project. He approved 135 change orders, several costing over $100,000. He also did not visualize from plans as well as seeing the actual construction. According to Jim Shaw (Buck Owens's right-hand man), on some occasions, he would see something constructed, and have it reconstructed larger and moved to a different location. The cost of the project would eventually reach $7.4 million. Also, the large number of change orders would delay the opening over a year. The Crystal Palace was opened in 1996, and shortly became a Bakersfield landmark.

Course  The Steinhuder Meerbach is the natural tailstream of Lake Steinhude. Its channel flow significantly exceeds the inflow of above-ground headstreams of the lake. It leaves the lake at its northwestern end and then flows west through the Meerbruch nature reserve and the village of Rehburg. It then swings northwards and empties, after , into the Weser at Nienburg. The Steinhuder Meerbach is canalised along almost its entire length.

History For almost a year, the group performed ambiguously under the names \\"Celli\\" and \\"Cellodarity\\" and eventually, exclusively \\"The Portland Cello Project.\\" Originally started by Tony Rogers, the first rehearsal took place at the Musicians Union in Portland, Oregon on August 16, 2006. Present at the rehearsal were Tony Rogers, Gideon Freudmann, Zoe Keating, Douglas Jenkins, and Jenette Mackie. Also invited to that first rehearsal were Justin Kagan, Todd Bayles, Skip vonKuske, Adam Hurst, and Noah Seitz.Wise, Brian, Strad Magazine, \\"Play that Funky Music\\", November 2009 The first performance of the group was at The Doug Fir Lounge in Portland, Oregon on Sunday October 15, 2006. The management and artistic direction responsibilities of the group were split between cellists Tony Rogers and Douglas Jenkins, until mid-2007 when Rogers left Portland for West Virginia. July 1, 2007 was Rogers last official show with the group at The Doug Fir Lounge. At this performance, the group surprised Rogers by dedicating to him a cover of John Denver's \\"Take Me Home Country Roads\\" with special guest Holcombe Waller singing. After Rogers' departure, Jenkins became the exclusive general manager and artistic director of the group. Jenkins also produced all of the recordings the group has released. In 2009 the group signed to a one-record deal with Kill Rock Stars, becoming the first and only cello ensemble on the record label.Dovey, Rachel, Paste Magazine, \\"Kill Rock Stars Signs Portland Cello Project\\", February 25, 2009 From 2009‚Äì10 the group had external management from Ingrid Renan and Slim Moon of Shotclock Management. In 2009 the group was added to the roster of The Billions Booking Agency, under Mary Brabec, who continues to work with them today. In 2012, the group recorded and released the songs from Beck's project, Song Reader, with guest singers. Philosophy While the goals of the group have evolved over the years, the group's current philosophy as stated on their website is: #\\"To bring the cello to places you wouldn't normally hear it.\\" #\\"To play music on the cello you wouldn't normally hear played on the instrument.\\" #\\"To build bridges across all musical communities by bringing a diverse assortment of musical collaborators on stage with them.\\" Touring The group's first tour was as main support for Buckethead on his west coast USA tour in December 2008.Campbell, Brett, Eugene Weekly, December 27, 2008 In spring 2009, the group toured as main support for Alexi Murdoch, also on the west coast.VanDragt, Braden, Seattle Weekly, \\"Alexi Murdoch at The Vera Project\\", April 5, 2009 The group's first national US and Canadian tour was with Thao with the Get Down Stay Down in fall 2009.

He was the father of the artist Charlotte Salomon, who was murdered in Auschwitz concentration camp during the Holocaust. Breast pathology In 1913, Salomon performed a study on 3,000 mastectomies. In the study, Salomon compared X-rays of the breasts to the actual removed tissue, observing specifically microcalcifications. By doing so, he was able to establish the difference as seen on an X-ray image between cancerous and non-cancerous tumors in the breast. Salomon's mammographs provided substantial information about the spread of tumors and their borders. In the midst of the study, Salomon also discovered that there are multiple types of breast cancer. Salomon was unable to use this technique in practice because he did not work with breast cancer patients, and although he published his findings in 1913, mammography did not become a common practice until years later. Later life Salomon was dismissed from the University of Berlin in 1933 after Adolf Hitler came to power. He was later imprisoned in Sachsenhausen concentration camp. He was released in 1939 and left for the Netherlands. From there he was deported to the Westerbork transit camp in (Drente) Holland, from where he escaped in 1943 and went into hiding in the Netherlands until 1945. After World War II ended, he moved to Amsterdam, where he worked as a professor.

Biography Giuliano Briganti was born in Rome. His father, Aldo Briganti, was an art dealer. Aldo studied under Igino Benvenuto Supino, graduated from the University of Bologna in 1914 with a thesis on Raphaelism, and was subsequently a student of Adolfo Venturi at the Advanced School of art history, part of the Faculty of Arts at the Sapienza University of Rome. Briganti's mother was named Clelia Urbinati. In 1936 Giuliano Briganti graduated from Ennio Quirino Visconti High School in Rome. In 1940 he received a degree in history of medieval and modern art from Sapienza university, disputing his thesis with Pietro Toesca on the cinquecento Bolognese painter Tibaldi. The thesis later took the form of a monograph, Mannerism and Pellegrino Tibaldi, published in 1945. Briganti‚Äôs first writings on art date to 1937, in the monthly ‚ÄúLa Ruota‚Äù. In 1940 he sat on the editorial committee of the magazine, together with Mario Alicata, Antonello Trombadori, Guglielmo Petroni and Carlo Muscetta, contributing various pieces until 1941. In 1938 he began to publish essays and reviews in ‚ÄúLa Critics d‚ÄôArte‚Äù, the art magazine founded by Carlo Ludovico Ragghianti and Ranuccio Bianchi Bandinelli. Between 1944 and 1945 he was editor of ‚ÄúCosmopolita‚Äù, a magazine founded by Alessandro Morandotti in June 1944 during the liberation of Rome. This weekly, a precursor of ‚ÄúL‚ÄôEspresso‚Äù, published work by many of twentieth century Italy‚Äôs foremost intellectuals: as well as Briganti himself these included Carlo Lizzani, Michelangelo Antonioni, Enzo Forcella, Giorgio Bassani, Renato Guttuso, Roberto Longhi, Anna Banti, Guido Carli, Arrigo Benedetti and Gastone Manacorda. From 1965 to 1968 he wrote a weekly art column for L'espresso, a position formerly held by Lionello Venturi and Carlo Ludovico Ragghianti. He was an art critic for la Repubblica from 1976, the year the newspaper was founded, until he died. In both cases he had been chosen as critic by Eugenio Scalfari, first for the weekly and then for the daily edition. Giuliano Briganti expressly named two men as his masters: Carlo Ludovico Ragghianti and Roberto Longhi. He was the latter‚Äôs secretary from 1941 to 1943, at his study in Via Benedetto Fortini 30, Florence. From 1950, with Francesco Arcangeli, Ferdinando Bologna and Federico Zeri, he was on the editorial board of the new magazine Paragone Arte, founded by Roberto Longhi, which until 1961 published important essays by Briganti on seventeenth century Italian painting. He left the editorial board definitively ten years later, in 1971. In 1949 he qualified as a university teacher and beginning from 1972 taught the history of modern and contemporary art at the University of Siena. In 1974 he married Luisa Laureati. In 1983 he moved to Rome where he held the chair of modern art history for a decade at what was then the Magistero and today is the Third University of Rome. Giuliano Briganti‚Äôs library and photo library, today owned by the Municipality of Siena, are housed in Palazzo Squarcialupi, Siena, which is part of the Santa Maria della Scala complex.

Gorlov (March 23, 1931 ‚Äì June 10, 2016) was a Russian mechanical engineer who was Professor Emeritus and Director of Hydro-Pneumatic Power Laboratory at Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts.  Early life  Alexander M. Gorlov was born into the family of a prosperous lawyer. His father was arrested and died in prison during Joseph Stalin's purges. His mother also spent a number of years in concentration camps in Russia, which forced young Alexander Gorlov to spend some of his childhood years in the orphanage in a remote Russian Urals area. Gorlov received his Doctorate in engineering and had a successful scientific career in Moscow for a number of years during the relatively liberal period of the so-called Khrushchev Thaw. He was granted the Gold and two Bronze Medals for Achievements of the USSR National Economy. In 1975 because of his friendship with Alexander Solzhenitsyn, the Nobel Prize winner and outspoken critic of the communist system, Gorlov was forced to break with his Soviet life and emigrate, eventually establishing a new home in the United States.  Career  Since 1976 Gorlov has been teaching Mechanical Engineering in the Northeastern University combining it with extensive research work in the area of harnessing renewable energy from water flows and wind. In the pursuit of his lifelong dream of creating inexpensive, environmentally friendly hydro-power, Gorlov has developed helical turbines for use in the river, tidal, and open ocean currents. His innovation has led to a series of patents for the Gorlov Helical Turbine which shows great promise for alleviating the worldwide crisis in energy use. This invention was named one of Popular Science's top 100 innovations of 2001. One of the other Gorlov's inventions - \\"Terrorist Truck- Bomb Protection System\\" - is certified by four US patents and is placed on the US Department of State list of certified equipment. That allows the system to be used for protection of vital Government installations such as nuclear power plants, military bases around the world, embassies, bridges and tunnels as well as other potential strategic targets from terrorist attacks. Gorlov has over 100 technical publications, including books, and 25 US and international patents in such fields as renewable energy, structural analysis & design, theoretical mechanics and the design of bridges and tunnels.

The stratigraphy is detected by radio- echo sounding. The Raymond effect arises from the unusual flow properties of ice. It is of importance because it provides field evidence for the flow properties of ice . In addition, it permits dating of changes in ice flow and the establishment of changes in ice thickness. The effect was first predicted by Charles F. Raymond. Ice viscosity is stress-dependent, and in zones where the (deviatoric) stresses are low, the viscosity becomes very high. Near the base of ice-sheets, stress is proportional to the surface slope, at least when averaged over a suitable horizontal distance. At the flow divide, the surface slope is zero, and calculations show that the viscosity increases. This diverts ice flow laterally, and is the cause of the characteristic anticlines, which are in effect draped over the high viscosity area.

Takoradi Market Circle is the commercial and economic hub of Ghana's Western Region. The market got its name due to the large circle in which it is situated; the stores of the market were built to form the shape. History The market was planned and built by city engineers to form the nucleus of trading for the new Takoradi city. The city became bustling after the building of the Takoradi Harbour, which served as a major export centre because of high export activity, many people migrated to the city for employment and this increase warranted the setting up the market. It was to be built at a site that was to be easily accessible. Accessibility The market's site makes it probably the most accessible point in the whole of the Takoradi metropolis. Major road lead to it. The John Mensah Sarbah road links the market from the South West and from the North East. The Liberation road linking it from the South East through the market to the North West. Other roads that access the market are the Ashanti Road and the Ahanata road. Major Activities All kinds of economic activities go on in and around the market. They include: *Banking *Trading of goods *Sale of food produce Most of the major banks in the country have branches around the market area. They include: *Ecobank *UniBank *Zenith Bank *Ghana Commercial Bank *AmalBank * CAL Bank * Fidelity Bank * Stanbic Bank *Access Bank *Societe General Bank *Guaranty Trust Bank *Opportunity Bank Hawkers Not all people who come to circle go through it for their groceries etc. Some prefer to buy from the outside of the circle due to convenience. As such many people who do not have stalls in the market rather prefer to sell their goods through hawking. These hawkers take over all the pedestrian walkways, parking spaces and built wooden sheds and warehouses, making the market circle untidy, dirty and congested. This is generally prohibited as it makes the regulation of market activities difficult as well as increase vehicular and human traffic. At occasions when the City guards, who serve as market law enforcement officials relax in the duty due to several reasons, these hawkers take to the streets and spaces around to market. Evicting these people once they have started their illegal activities becomes expensive and time-consuming. Eviction exercises make pedestrian movement easier, faster and convenient. Market Expansion The market became congested in the late 1980s. The problem became worse in the early 1990s when the city authorities could no longer allocate space for individuals who had requested for stores, stalls etc. As such a new market was planned and built at Apremodo. Apremodo is a suburb of Takoradi and about 10 kilometres from the Market Circle. Since its completion, traders have refused to move there always citing the long distance as a reason. Though the Apremdo market had been provided with water, electricity, security and warehouse facilities to make trading activities safe, conducive and disease free but the traders and shop owners have persistently refused to use it. The Apremdo Market still remains empty whiles traders are willing to sell close to refuse dumps, open drains and places of convenience. Sanitation A major problem of the market is that of filth. Due to the size of the market as well as the number of people who use it daily, there is always need to keep the market clean. In February 2011, the Sekondi-Takoradi Metropolitant Assembly (STMA), the government agency that has among its responsibilities market sanitation, engaged Zoomlion, a waste management company to keep the market clean. With their services available, the market is generally expected to be cleaner. The market is bordered all around by large underground gutters. These drain liquid waste from the market. Sometimes, these gutters get chocked by solid waste too. When these are not cleared, the causes flooding around the market sometimes making it impossible for vehicles to drive around it. As a way to get the gutters free, the market authorities in conjunction with the Ghana National Fire Service clean then up by using large diameter water hoses to pump water at great force through the gutters. This moves the solid waste that may have clogged up the gutter away to point where they can be collected thereby clearing the gutters up. Fires at the Market Like many big markets in Ghana, fires cause the most destruction to markets. The market has had a lot of fire outbreaks with most destroying properties running in several hundreds of thousands of Cedis. The most recent one was on the 16th of March, 2007http://news.myjoyonline.com/news/200703/2571.asp when properties worth millions of cedis were lost when fire swept through portions of the market. It burnt quantities of goods to ashes. The fire started around 1830 hours, was finally brought under control around 2300 hours. No casualties were recorded. After starting at one point, the fire quickly spread to other parts of the market destroying cooking oil, palm oil, cooking utensils, rubber products, foodstuffs and cloths, fowls, animals, shoes, bags and cereals, among others. In situations like this it take the intervention of fire personnel situated close to the market to bring the fires down.

The market is one of the largest in the city and consists of three sections: one for clothing, one for furniture and one for foodstuffs, mostly selling to lower income customers. The market is surrounded by small stores and street vendors, many specializing in furniture and dresses and other needs for formal occasions. On Sundays, the number of street vendors grows significantly, a weekly ‚Äútianguis‚Äù market called a baratillo which traditionally sells used items. One section of this baratillo has developed into a market for antiques, which has attracted higher income customers and even famous ones such as Carlos Monsiv√°is. Main market La Lagunilla is one of Mexico City's largest markets, and the term usually refers to both the fixed buildings of the market proper and its associated tianguis or street market. This tianguis is officially on Sunday, but in reality, there are street vendors around this market all week, who extend and merge into the neighboring Tepito tianguis. The market straddles a major east west road called Eje 1 North, also called Ray√≥n, in Colonia Morelos, about ten blocks north of the Zocalo, just outside the historic center of the city. The market is located in the La Lagunilla barrio (informal neighborhood), next to the Santa Catarina Church. The plaza of this church was the site of area's main outdoor market or tianguis, through the colonial period to the late 19th century. Other landmarks nearby include the Guelatao Sports Center, and Plaza Garibaldi just to the west, known for its mariachis. The area is a lower socioeconomic one and most of the market's clientele are from this and similar areas. This market is always very crowded and very lively, especially those areas that sell food, clothing and other everyday items. The neighborhood has a dangerous reputation, but the market area is considered to be safe enough if visitors take basic precautions. About 2,000 families depend on this market directly or indirectly, but it faces pressure from commercial plazas and pressure from imports from Asia and other mass-produced items. Many of the vendors are third generation at the market, but many have been forced to change the merchandise they sell or complement their traditional wares in order to stay in business. Window of a bridal shop in La Lagunilla Essentially, the entire Lagunilla neighborhood is commercial, and has been since Aztec times. It and neighboring Tepito have been the focus of a number of films, televisions series and other artistic creations as it is considered to be iconic of Mexico City's lower classes. One feature film focused on this area was ‚ÄúLagunilla, mi barrio‚Äù and a telenovela called Lagunilla was in production in the 1990s. Eugenio Derbez is a television producer who specializes in creating series based on the real life of ordinary Mexicans. He has sent actors and actresses to do ‚Äúfield study‚Äù in Lagunilla and other markets to learn how to imitate correctly the vocabulary and accents of the people they will portray. The market area was the subject of a late 1990s exhibition of black and white photographs taken by Manuel Alvarez B. Martinez in the 1960s and 1970s. La Lagunilla is one of the city's loudest areas. The sound level in the market can be deafening, with the sounds of street vendors arguing police sirens, honking cars and blaring music from many of the stalls selling music and DVDs. In 2006, the city passed a law to impose decibel limits, but most residents felt it was futile. The fixed market proper consists of three buildings, two larger ones on the south side of Eje 1 Norte and one smaller one on the north side. Building One has one thousand stands, and mostly focuses on new clothing and fashion. However, this area is greatly expanded by street vendors on Sundays, which add other items such as vintage clothing to the offerings. Building Two has 579 stands, 120 vendors and is dedicated to furniture and home d√©cor. Furniture sold includes bedroom sets, bathroom appliances, kitchen cabinets, desks, dining sets, cribs, and much more. Much of the offering is rustic or minimalist ins style, with some modern designs. Much of the furniture sold at the market is made by the vendors themselves. On the streets surrounding this building, such as Allende, Ecuador, Paraguay and Honduras, there are a number of furniture stores as well as street vendors, which usually sell unfinished or rustic furniture and home items. It has had famous customers such as Antonio Aguilar, Sr., Yuri and Irma Serrano, as well as legislators and government officials as clients. However, the furniture market is better known to older generations than younger, with many preferring to buy furniture at upscale stores, even though prices are up to seventy percent higher. The furniture building contains various types of furniture from rustic to minimalist to modern. To help preserve and promote the furniture market, there is a Feria de Mueble (Furniture Fair) held each year in May. The fair features the local merchants but outside craftsmen are also invited. The fair includes exhibits by young furniture designers who are known for minimalist and modern designs as well as traditional ones. The fair is partially sponsored by the Autoridad y el Fideicomiso del Centro Hist√≥rico as part of conservation efforts. Building three is in a smaller building on the north side of Eje 1 Norte. It has 319 stands and mostly sells produce and other food items. Another attraction of the market is that it is surrounded by a number of small specialty shops and many street vendors. Most of the specialty shops are furniture stores or those related to items for formal occasions, such as weddings and quincea√±eras. Most sell women's dresses in fantasy and princess styles for these events, as well as baptisms, presentations and many more, but there are also shops dedicated to elaborate decorations and party favors (either made or supplies to be made) along with some related services such as photography. Most of these stores are located on Honduras, Allende and Chile Streets with some in Building 2 on the south side. Street vendors crowd Eje 1 North and the side streets on either side in both the La Lagunilla and Tepito neighborhoods. Those closest to the fixed market buildings often sell items similar to that which is inside, and those located near the formal occasion shops emulate these as well. This informal market has grown such that vendors with stalls and vehicles now routinely block several of the main avenue's six lanes. The problem begins from Comonfort Street, two blocks from Paseo de la Reforma. Here, vendors have taken over the lane dedicated to buses, with stands selling clothing, food, unlicensed CDs and DVDs and more. In some side streets, traffic is cut in half and in the smallest, there is no passage of vehicular traffic at all on weekends. In total, there are eleven city blocks severely affected by this. Cuauht√©moc borough authorities state that they do not have enough personnel to effect an eviction of the vendors. Earlier attempts to do this have resulted in threats to administration officials. Another issue is that many roving vendors sell beer and customers in the market proper can be seen drinking their purchases as they walk through the aisles. The most popular form of buying beer here is a ‚Äúmichelada‚Äù with a large bottle of beer (940ml) called a caguama emptied into a large cup and mixed with lime juice, salt and sometimes chili pepper and Worcestershire sauce. These vendors do not ask for proof of age. This informal market has made La Lagunilla one of the main centers for the production and sale of bootlegged CDs and DVDs. Sunday tianguis View of the Sunday antiques market at La Lagunilla Although the fixed market is surrounded by street vendors everyday, on Sunday street vendors are more crowded and extend over the more blocks of the neighborhood. This event is called the tianguis day or mercado de pulgas (flea market), because it is based on the tradition of selling secondhand items, which is called ‚Äúbaratillo‚Äù (little cheap one). There are thousands of baratillo markets in Mexico City but the best known are Tepito, Santa Cruz Meyehualco, Santa Martha Acatitla and San Felipe de Jes√∫s along with La Lagunilla. There is a popular saying in Mexico City that these markets ‚Äúone can gather the pieces needed to build a helicopter.‚Äù These markets consist of a multitude of vendors selling parts of automobiles, televisions, bicycles, radios, computers, refrigerators, toys, stoves, clothes, shoes, chips, hens, turkeys, fighting cocks in various colors and more. Shopping on this day begin very early as this is when there is the best selection. However, not all of the vendors on Sunday sell second hand items. Building One, the clothing section, is expanded by vendors who also sell clothes. While there is a notable presence of vintage clothing sellers on this day, most sell new and current fashions, many knock-offs of major designers. Stalls change merchandise frequently and currents modes of fashion can easily be seen from these stalls. One example was the proliferation of Indian style clothing which was popular in the mid 2000s in the city. There are also vendors selling other things related to fashion, such as henna tattoos and custom fingernail work. The main distinction between the La Lagunila baratillo and others is that a section of it has developed into an antiques market. This section is centered on Comonfort Street and attracts collectors and tourists from both Mexico and abroad. It is the best known of a number of antiques markets including Mercardo Cuauhtemoc, Mercado de Alvaro Obregon and Plaza del Angel in Mexico City along with Callej√≥n del Sapo in Puebla and El Baratillo in Guadalajara. The antiques market is one of the most traditional in Mexico City as interaction between seller and buyer is intense and personal. Good bargainers can get discounts of as much as thirty percent. As part of selling, many vendors will relate stories about the pieces, which may or may not be true. The market has attracted some foreign buyers and sellers and with the Internet and other sources of information, most sellers are more aware of the prices their items can fetch. In the past, this antiques market was known as cheap, but that is not true anymore. Some of the collectibles sold at the market The types of antiques and collectibles sold is vast, but some of the most common include books, magazines, coins, toys, handcrafts and furniture. However, other finds include silverware, movie posters, jewelry, photographs, LP records, watches, cameras, 19th century brass beds, appliances and musical instruments. (mood163-164) While they can still be found today, one of the objects more often sold in the past in the market was pre Hispanic artifacts, especially in the 1940s. These objects have included those from the Mezcala, Colima, Nayarit, Chalco and Totonaca cultures, ranging from the pre Classic to the post Classic periods. One of the objects in greatest demand today is toys made of tin, which can sell in the United States for up to 1,000 dollars. Antiques merchants here have found that economic downturns do not affect their businesses very much. They also commented that knowledgeable American and Japanese collectors pay significantly more for many items, especially for items such as comic books and toys. During the 20th century, this antiques market developed a following among many of Mexico City's wealthier residents and has boasted of a number of famous frequent customers. One was writer Juan Jos√© Arreola, who bought old books, sometimes as he sipped whisky from a glass. Another was engineer Guillermo Gonz√°lez Camarena, who invented color television. He reputedly bought the components to build his first video camera here in 1934. Other shoppers in the antiques market have included Dr. Adam Corder, Jacobo Zabludovsky, Jes√∫s Reyes Ferreira, Manuel Contreras, Eduardo Manzao and Ava Vargas. Mar√≠a F√©lix and Irma Serrano (La Tigresa) were known to buy and collect dolls here. Some of the markets most notable collector clients have included bookseller Carlos Ibarra, who amassed a collection of about 30,000 postcards, architect Jorge Zavala, noted for his restoration of historic monuments, bought books, masks, bottles, ceramics and crafts from the 19th and early 20th centuries. His collection of Mexican masks was amassed over twenty five years. Ava Vargas collected old photographs. German engineer Ernesto Richheimer was called the ‚ÄúSe√±or de las Cucharas‚Äù (Lord of the Spoons) because of is ‚Äúincurable‚Äù affection for these utensils. He collected spoons over fifty years from markets all over the world. His collection of 2,300 pieces was displayed at the Museo Nacional de Historia and included samples from ancient times to the present and from all over the world. One other major collector who was also famous was Carlos Monsiv√°is, who considered La Lagunilla one of his most important sources for his collections. During his first visit to La Lagunilla in 1968, Carlos Monsiv√°is found an old copy of La familia Burr√≥n when no one thought this series by Gabriel Vargas was collectible. He was regularly found here and other markets in the city adding to his collection which eventually filled his house in the Portales neighborhood to overflowing. This collection was amassed over forty years and included stamps, postcards, scorecards, handcrafts by artisans such as Teresa Nava, Susana and Teodoro Torres, and Roberto Ruiz, photographs, popular toys, albums, calendars, comics, newspapers, notebooks and cookbooks. The Museo del Estanquillo, founded in 2006 to house his collection, contains about 20,000 objects acquired over thirty years. The market has also had famous sellers, such as Ignacio Contreras (better known as ‚ÄúEl Chacharitas‚Äù) who was noted among collectors as able to obtain all kinds of valuable objects at elevated prices. However, those who knew how to bargain could obtain significant discounts. El Chacharitas states that the sale of antiques was a very good business in the past but less so now. Much of the reason is the degradation of the neighborhood and the invasion of those selling mass-produced, unlicensed and counterfeit merchandise. The antiques market also has been hurt by Mexico City mayor Marcelos Ebrard's decision to close roads in and around the historic center as well as Paseo de la Reforma to vehicular traffic on Sundays, the day this market operates. For some vendors, business is down by as much as sixty percent, as many upper class residents will not use public transportation to get to this market. History The La Lagunilla market was established and named after the La Lagunilla neighborhood, just outside the historic center of Mexico City. In the pre Hispanic era, this land was a small lagoon, which connected to the larger Lake Texcoco. This lagoon was important as docks for barges bringing merchandise into the Tlatelolco market. The activities of ancient Aztec markets were commented upon by Bernal D√≠az del Castillo and other conquistadors who marveled at their size and variety of merchandise. However, all Aztec markets were outdoors, consisting of stands set up by the vendors themselves and taken down at the end of the day. During the colonial period, the lagoon dried along with the rest of Lake Texcoco and only the name serves as a reminder of the area's former geography as ‚Äúla lagunilla‚Äù means ‚Äúthe small lake.‚Äù The neighborhood of La Lagunilla was built over this dried lagoon. Originally, the neighborhood was filled with mansions for the upper classes. Many still remain, as they have never been replaced by more modern constructions. As the area's economy has been strongly linked to commerce since the Aztec era, evolution of the area into a lower-class neighborhood brought in large scale commerce. The area had an important market in colonial times which was located at the plaza of the Santa Catarina Church. This church was founded in 1586. In 1640, it was converted from a monastery to a parish church. The current building on the site dates from 1740. The market held on its plaza was third in importance after the El Par√≠an and El Volador during the colonial period. In 1833, a cholera outbreak spurred the abandonment of the area by wealthier residents and the area become lower class. The plaza remained crowded and important because of its proximity to the Royal Tobacco Factory. La Lagunilla is the descendant of a type of market called the ‚Äúbaratillo‚Äù (lit. little cheap one), which specialized in handcrafts, secondhand items and foodstuffs for the poor. It is from this tradition of secondhand items that the antiques market evolved. The first market of this type was El Baratillo in the Zocalo in the 16th century. However, in 1609, the viceroy of New Spain banned this type of merchandise from the plaza, citing health and public security concerns. These vendors then went to other markets such as those in Tepito and La Lagunilla, where they remain to this day. The area was reorganized into formal neighborhoods called ‚Äúcolonias‚Äù as Mexico City grew outside of its traditional confines in the latter 19th century. The new colonias were Santa Mar√≠a la Redonda, Guerrero and Santa Mar√≠a de la Ribera. The La Lagunilla market was created to replace the Santa Catarina tianguis, on lands next to it related to Callej√≥n del Basilisco, the Plazuiela del Tequiesquite, Callej√≥n de los Papas and 2a Calle de la Amargura. This first market was built between 1912 and 1913 as a series of wooden stalls with roofs by engineers Miguel √Ångel de Quevedo and Ernesto Canseco. Initially, it was dedicated to the sale of produce, eggs and grains, with sections for domestic fowl and fish. During the 20th century, the market absorbed merchants from the closure of markets located in and near the Z√≥calo, the main square of Mexico City. In addition to the vendors on the square itself, merchants came from the closing of the tianguis at the Plazuela del Factor (today the site of the House of the Legislative Assembly), the Plaza Villamil (today the site of the Blanquita Theatre) and the Mercado del Volador (today the site of the Supreme Court) . This caused overcrowding and chaos in the area, with most of the area impassable to traffic by the 1950s. The government decided to replace the wooden stalls with new, modern warehouse-type constructions consisting of three sections built by architect Pedro Ram√≠rez V√°zquez. Like other traditional public markets in Mexico, La Laguinilla has struggled to remain solvent in the face of competition from chain stores and other more modern selling venues. However, it has withstood this competition better than many others of its kind in the city. In the late 2000s, the city has worked to renovate areas in and around Plaza Garibaldi, which includes some areas around the market. The focus of this project is to promote tourism to the area.

His works enjoyed a wide-ranging, popular appeal in the United States, and he was probably one of the most recognizable cover illustrators of the day. Early life Charles Archibald MacLellan, son of Charles and Augusta (Clute) McLellan, was born June 22, 1885, in Trenton, Ontario, Canada. His father, Dr. Charles McLellan was born in Scotland in 1844. He was an orphaned and subsequently brought to Canada by his uncle in 1852. Dr. McLellan received his M.D. at the University of Toronto, and practiced there until 1892 when, by way of the Grand Trunk Railway, he moved to Chicago. After graduating from high school and having completed his preparatory work, young Charles intended to enroll at the University of Chicago. However, he opted to begin formal studies at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago instead, where several well-known artists such as Dunn, Shrader, and Hoskins were at that time. MacLellan spent about two and a half years at the Institute before he accepted a position at an engraving house in Chicago, ultimately concluding his studies under the tutelage of the legendary Howard Pyle. Soon afterward, he leased a studio of his own, in the Auditorium Tower. While in Chicago, Charles A. MacLellan illustrated several magazine covers, designs for stained glass windows, advertisement posters for Marshall Field & Company, and a myriad of newspaper sketches for the Chicago Examiner. Career 23 Aug 1924 cover of The Saturday Evening Post by MacLellan. In 1909, \\"Mac,\\" as he was referred to by his friends, relocated to a studio that was built by Howard Pyle at 1305 North Franklin Street, Wilmington, Delaware. At that time, MacLellan began painting calendars for Rand McNally & Co., establishing a highly successful illustration career that lasted through the first half of the twentieth century. MacLellan is best known by virtue of his many illustrations featured on the cover of The Saturday Evening Post. Between 1913 and 1936, MacLellan's work appeared on forty-four Saturday Evening Post covers, making him one of the most prolific Post cover illustrators of his day. MacLellan specialized in the female form, and nearly all of his cover illustrations feature a woman as the central, and often only, subject. During the early 1930s, Charles A. MacLellan feared that he would lose his eyesight and that he would be unable to continue working as an artist. Not surprisingly, he decided to travel west, in all probability, to find a new direction in life. Fortunately, he didn't lose his eyesight, and returned to Wilmington to concentrate on teaching and portrait painting. Awards Throughout his career, MacLellan received numerous awards and accolades, including those from the Wilmington Society of the Fine Arts, the Pasadena Art Institute, the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, the Terry Art Institute, and the Delaware Art Museum, which owns three of his oil paintings; \\"A Young Singer,\\" \\"Tinker Bell,\\" and \\"Attic Finery.\\" The Studio Group in Wilmington owns one of his studies for a portrait, \\"Head of a Girl,\\" and the Brandywine River Museum in Chadds Ford Township, Pennsylvania, owns a commissioned landscape by MacLellan as well. Other Interests Charles A. MacLellan's hobbies included gardening, golfing, and occasionally acquiring antique furniture on behalf of the Winterthur Museum in Winterthur, Delaware. In fact, in 1926, he was chairman of an exhibition presented by the Wilmington Society of the Fine Arts entitled \\"Early American Furniture.\\" MacLellan was also a member of the Accessions Committee at the Wilmington Society of the Fine Arts from 1943 until 1958, and he taught at the Studio Group, located at Howard Pyle's old studio, from 1943 until his death in 1961. After his death, a memorial exhibition was held at 1305 North Franklin Street, from December 3 through December 17, 1961. Thirty-three works of art were displayed, including items on loan from the Delaware Art Museum, as well as items from the collection of Mr. and Mrs. Caesar Grasselli, Mr. and Mrs. David Stockwell, Mr. and Mrs. Lammot du Pont Copeland, Mr. and Mrs. Alfred Bissell, Mr. and Mrs. Wm. A. Worth, and Mr. and Mrs. George Bissell. Notes References *Butterfield, Roger. The Saturday Evening Post Treasury. Simon & Schuster, 1970. *Clay, H.

It occurs in Europe and builds simple nests in rock crevices. Description This species has the typical ant body pattern of head, mesosoma and metasoma, with the first two segments of the metasoma forming a distinct waist. It is light brown and has a few short pale coloured hairs. The antennae are elbowed and there are a pair of compound eyes and three ocelli. Biology View of head from above Temnothorax albipennis workers performing a tandem run As with other ants, there is a single, relatively large queen that lays eggs in the nest and a large number of workers. These are all non-breeding females and leave the nest to forage and collect building materials for its construction and repair. T. albipennis builds simple nests in cracks in rocks, enclosed by walls built from tiny pebbles and grains of sand. In an experiment where two sizes of sand grain were offered to ants that were foraging for building materials, the ants always chose the smaller grains although this was wasteful in terms of building efficiency.Building behaviour in Temnothorax albipennis T. albipennis scouts show behavioural lateralization when exploring unknown nest sites, showing a population-level bias to prefer left turns. One possible reason for this is that its environment is partly maze-like and consistently turning in one direction is a good way to search and exit mazes without getting lost. This turning bias is correlated with slight asymmetries in the ants' compound eyes (differential ommatidia count). Another experiment examined the division of labour in ant colonies and found that there tended to be a few high performance workers in small colonies which performed tasks considerably more efficiently than the other workers. This was not the case in larger colonies, and in both cases, there were a high proportion of inactive workers.Larger colonies do not have more specialized workers in the ant Temnothorax albipennis Ants are one of the most successful insects on the planet and there is a long-held view that this is because of the division of labour and the way certain workers specialise in certain tasks. An experiment was carried out to examine whether these specialist ants actually performed the task better than other workers. The ants were marked with drops of paint and then were videotaped while they performed such tasks as foraging, transporting the brood and nest building. The conclusions were that, though some ants performed a range of jobs and others specialised in a single task, the latter were found not to be any more efficient at their selected tasks than were the generalists. However the specialists did put in more time on the job than the other ants so the colony overall benefited from their specialisation. Research tracking T. albipennis movements found that they move in similar ways both outside and inside the nest, suggesting that workers are principally generalists equipped to do multiple tasks. The duration of each new ant movement appears to be predetermined to some degree (this is known as motor planning), which may make navigating their complex society easier. However, a reanalysis of the same data reached a different conclusion, suggesting that the previous conclusions need further justification. Another behaviour exhibited by colonies of this species is the ability to react to predator attacks as a single unit. It has been shown that colonies will respond differentially to predation events dependent on their location within the colony, and workers will withdraw or disperse appropriately to enable effective mitigation of mortality. Ants of this species have been observed teaching each other through a process known as tandem running. An experienced forager leads a na√Øve nest-mate to a newly discovered resource such as food or an empty nest site. The follower obtains knowledge of the route by following in the footsteps of the tutor, maintaining contact with its antennae. Both leader and follower are aware of the progress made by the other with the leader slowing when the follower lags and speeding up when the follower gets too close. Depending on how far away a new resource is, colonies will modulate the number of tandem runs that they perform, with a greater number of tandem runs occurring when the desired resource is more distant. Furthermore, the relative contribution that workers make to this process differs widely among individuals, with certain ants attempting many more tandem runs than others.

History The community was named by Marie F. Pollock, who began selling lots in the development in 1935. Tierra del mar is Spanish for \\"land by the sea\\". One of the streets in the community is named after Pollock. In 1990, author Ralph Friedman described Tierra del Mar as a \\"growing toss of houses\\". =Projected location of Facebook submarine cable= Beginning in 2019, Tierra del Mar residents voiced opposition to Facebook subsidiary Edge Cable Holdings, USA's planned transpacific cable crossing to Asia, known as the JUPITER Cable System. Tillamook County approved the plan in January 2020. According to Facebook, Tierra del Mar is a likely site for a new branch of a fibre optic undersea telecommunications cable. Facebook's data center in Prineville, Oregon, could be connected more easily with Japan and the Philippines with the cable. The cable is to be wholly owned by Facebook and will split off from the 60 Tbps JUPITER cable that has its main branch ashore in Hermosa Beach, California and is owned by telecommunication firms in the Philippines (PLDT), Hong Kong (PCCW Global), and Japan (NTT, which is building the JUPITER cable system) as well as SoftBank Telecommunications, Amazon, and Facebook. Edge Cable Holdings, USA, purchased a beachfront property about the size of 10 tennis courts for $495,000 from former University of Oregon football player Joey Harrington in 2018. From Tierra del Mar, the submarine cable, once ashore, could connect underground with another cable in Pacific City. On 28 April 2020, the drill hit an unexpected area of hard rock. The drill bit seized and the drill pipe snapped 50 feet below the seafloor. The crew was able to recover some of the equipment, but left the rest in the hole. Some of pipe, the drill head, and of drilling fluid remain in the hole. Facebook has no plans to retrieve the equipment.

Design and development The D-8 was conceived by Coward as an easy-to-build and inexpensive all-aluminium glider with good performance, that could be flown with or without a canopy. Later flight testing of a completed D-8 showed that the hoped-for performance was not achieved as the glide ratio was measured at just 17:1 with no canopy fitted. Coward designed the D-8 and sold plans, but never built a prototype. The first D-8 was built by Klaus Hill and Bruno Hauffe who purchased plans in 1963. Virl Kimber made the first flight of the aircraft in May 1964. Early aircraft built showed that the ailerons and rudder were too small and that the wing was set at too high an angle of incidence for safety and most were subsequently modified. The plans were changed to incorporate larger ailerons. The all-metal wing is a one piece unit in span and in weight, that proved a challenge to design a trailer to carry. At least five were completed, including one built by members of the Lockhaven Glider Club in Pennsylvania. That same aircraft was used for extensive flight testing by a subsequent owner to accurately measure its performance. One was built as a powered motor glider.

He was one of the most renowned French designers of the 1950s. Early years Mat√©got was born on 4 April 1910 at T√°pi√≥-Sully, a village about from Budapest in Hungary. He studied at the school of fine arts and architecture in Budapest between 1925 and 1929. He created sets for the National Theater. He then traveled in Italy and the United States before settling in France in 1931. There he took jobs that included making sets for the Folies Berg√®re, window dressing at the Galeries Lafayette, designing women's dresses and, in the late 1930s, creating tapestries. In 1933 he started to create his first examples of rattan furniture mounted on metal frames. Mat√©got volunteered for the French army at the start of World War II (1939‚Äì45) and was taken prisoner, being freed in 1944. As a prisoner, he worked in a plant manufacturing mechanical accessories, where he learned the techniques and potential of sheet metal. After being released he became naturalized as a French citizen. Furniture designer Following the war, Mat√©got established a workshop for making handcrafted furniture using a variety of materials such as metal, rattan, glass, formica, and perforated sheet metal. The workshop made chairs, tables, sideboards, desks and other objects that he had designed. At first based in Paris, the workshop later moved to Casablanca. All the furniture and other objects had clever, practical and amusing designs. Distributed to decoration shops in editions of 200, his work was extremely successful. Mat√©got designed the three-legged \\"Nagasaki\\" chair in 1954 and the \\"Copacabana\\" armchair (1955/1956), both made of steel tube and perforated sheet metal, characteristic materials whose use Mat√©got pioneered. The Nagasaki chair is now held in the design collection at the Mus√©e des Arts D√©coratifs, Paris. The Copacabana armchair is in the design collection at the Centre Georges Pompidou, Beaubourg, Paris. Mat√©got furnished or decorated buildings such as the Hotel de France in Conakry, Guinea, the Drugstrore Publicis in Paris and the Maison de l'ORTF in Paris (1962). Return to tapestry Mat√©got continued to work on tapestry while engaged in other design activities, and a 1962 book La Demeure et les √âditions des deux mondes pr√©sentent les tapisseries de Mathieu Mat√©got documented some of his more important works to that date. In early 1960s, Mat√©got left furniture design to devote himself full-time to tapestry work, becoming one of leaders of the modern movement in French tapestry. His tapestries today hang in many major buildings. For example, three of his works are in the National Library of Australia. When the building was opened, the \\"three remarkable tapestries [were] glowing like jewels in the marble-clad foyer\\". He was a friend of Jean Lur√ßat. His work used a restrained range of colors in rigorously abstract designs. Mathieu Mat√©got died at Angers, France in February 2001.

Below left: Stadthagen The Schaumburg Forest () is a wooded region, about with an area of around 40 km¬≤, in the district of Schaumburg in the German federal state of Lower Saxony.  Location  The Schaumburg Forest lies immediately east of the Lower Saxony's state border with North Rhine- Westphalia in the northwestern part of the district of Schaumburg not far east of the River Weser, south of the Rehburg Hills and northwest of the Mittelland Canal. It extends from W√∂lpinghausen in the north, to Pollhagen and Meerbeck in the east (on the far side and east of the county town of Stadthagen and the town of Obernkirchen), to B√ºckeburg in the south, to the town of Minden in the southwest and the town of Petershagen and municipality of Wiedensahl in the west. To the north it almost borders, with the Rehburg Hills, on the district of Nienburg. The Schaumburg Forest, which is 19.5 km long and up to 4 km wide, lies on the North German Plain at between about 45 and ; its highest point is west of the L 371 state road (Landesstra√üe) from W√∂lpinghausen in the north to Pollhagen in the south. The boundary of Minden-L√ºbbecke district which lies in North Rhine-Westphalia, runs almost exactly along the northwest border of the forest. That said, several tongues of wood project into Westphalian territory, (e.g. south of Petershagen-Borstel). In addition the numerous nearby copses in the vicinity of the town of Petershagen may be counted as part of the Schaumburg Forest in a broader sense, so that Minden-L√ºbbecke can claim part of the forest for itself. A wide track called the Landwehrallee runs through the eastern areas of the central part of the Schaumburg Forest roughly parallel to the Mittelland Canal and close to the edge of the forest. The track runs from Mittelbrink-Landwehr (part of Niedernw√∂hren) in the northeast to Rusbend (part of B√ºckeburg) in the southeast.  History  In earlier times, the Schaumburg Forest was a border area between the Principality of Schaumburg-Lippe and Prussia; today parts of its western perimeter form part of the border with North Rhine-Westphalia. A boundary embankment, the Schaumburger Landwehr, runs for about 25 km through the Schaumburg Forest. It once extended as far as Lake Steinhude and, in the Middle Ages, marked the border of Schaumburg-Lippe with Westphalia. The Schaumburg Forest is the western remnant of the historic D√ºlwald forest that once extended from Minden to Lake Steinhude and was a border forest of the old Saxon districts or Gaue. In the middle of the forest, on the road connecting Petershagen to B√ºckeburg, is the Baum Hunting Lodge and a small mausoleum, the final resting place of the Schaumburg count, William and his family. There is another mausoleum in the southern part of the Schaumburg Forest about 1 km north of the road connecting Meinsen and Cammer (both part of B√ºckeburg). It contains the coffins of the founder of Bad Eilsen, Princess Juliana of Schaumburg-Lippe (1761-1799), and her mother. Juliana had become a widow early and the grave of her secret lover, the Prince's senior forester, Clemens August von Kaas (1760-1832), is very well hidden in the forest east of Baum Castle. Schaumburg Forest became of cultural and historical significance because the artist, Wilhelm Busch, often drew and painted at sites along its forest edges and in its glades. His birthplace, Wiedensahl, where he later often stayed, was close to the western edge of the forest.  Flora and fauna  Schaumburg Forest forms about half of the timber forest in B√ºckeburg belonging to Alexander, Prince of Schaumburg-Lippe. The other half of the forest, that is, the entire woodland area north of the L 372 road from Wiedensahl to Niedernw√∂hren, is owned by the state of Lower Saxony. Schaumburg Forest is a mixed forest, predominantly of oak and beech with remnants of old oak wood pasture. Since time immemorial, the great oaks were the most important economic factor in the Schaumburg Forest. The forest is very popular with cyclists because of its spacious and shady woodland trails that on flat terrain that often stretch for miles. There are also two tourist-oriented cycleways through the Schaumburg Forest with thematic information by the trackside, route maps and directions: the \\"Wilhelm Busch Route\\" and the \\"Prince's Route\\" (F√ºrstenroute), which cross almost the whole length of the Schaumburg Forest from Spie√üingshol in the north to Rusbend in the south. Refreshments are available in Hiddenserborn (by Mittelland Canal on the edge of the forest), in Mittelbrink (in the middle of the forest) and in Wiedensahl close by the forest. Of the forest's natural wildlife, the large stags and herds of wild boar are particularly noteworthy. In addition, the forest is also home to fallow deer and roe deer.

Often called RMD Hawaii for short, the chapter has branches on Oahu, Kauai, Maui and the Big Island of Hawaii in Kohala and Waimea. The headquarters for the Hawaii chapter is on Oahu.  History  Ryukyukoku Matsuri Daiko Hawaii was founded by Akemi Martin in 1996. The first performance in Hawaii was at the Kuakini Senior Center on June 20, 1997. On March 10, 2000 the club celebrated its third anniversary with a Nabiraki performance at the Ala Moana Hotel. Performers from the club headquarters in Okinawa as well as the Okinawan singer and songwriter Hidekatsu Kamei came to participate. The Kauai branch was founded in 2002 and the Maui branch in 2003. On April 1, 2007 the club celebrated its tenth anniversary with a recital at the Magic of Polynesia theater in Waikiki. Once again, performers from Okinawa and Hidekatsu Kamei came to participate. The first Big Island branch was established in Kohala in 2008, and a branch in Waimea was established in December 2009. The Waimea group first performed in 2010. The club celebrated its fifteenth anniversary on June 19, 2011 with a recital at the Blaisdell Concert Hall in Honolulu. Performers from RMD Okinawa, Nakasone Dance Academy ‚Äì Hoogei Kai, Polynesian Cultural Center, as well as singers Hidekatsu Kamei and Shinsaku Ikeda performed with the Hawaii chapter. In 2013 the Kauai Branch held a recital at the Kauai Community College Performing Arts Center. Once again Hidekatsu Kamei came from Okinawa to perform, as well as members of the celebrated Okinawan Eisa group Requios.  Activities  Ryukyukoku Matsuri Daiko Hawaii performs around the islands at public events as well as for private parties. The feature performance of the year is at the Hawaii United Okinawa Association's Okinawan Festival at Kapiolani Park in Honolulu each Labor Day weekend. Members from all the island branches come to perform together for this event. Other notable events the group performs at include the Japanese Cultural Center of Hawaii's Ohana New Years Festival at Moili'ili Park in Honolulu, the Hui Alu Kauai Okinawan Dance Festival on Kauai and the Waimea Cherry Blossom Festival in Waimea on the Big Island. Each branch of the club also conducts beginner classes. On Oahu the classes are arranged through the Honolulu Department of Parks and Recreation.  Style and choreography  All of the club's choreography is created in Okinawa by the members of the headquarters chapter. The club's style of eisƒÅ taiko is called \\"sosaku daiko\\" or creative taiko. It uses elements of traditional Okinawan Eisa and Karate in the choreography. The music ranges from traditional Okinawan and Japanese folk music to modern rock, and occasionally a blend of both. This style of taiko was created in Okinawa in 1982 by Ryukyukoku Matsuri Daiko. Three types of drums are used by RMD performers. Unlike other forms of taiko, RMD's Okinawan Eisa taiko drummers all carry their own drum, usually using only one bachi (drumstick) to dance and drum. Some drummers use the o-daiko (a large drum carried on a purple sash over the left shoulder). Others play hand drums, either the shime-daiko (a double sided, knotted or tied drum) or the paranku (a single sided drum).  Symbols  The logo for all Ryukyukoku Matsuri Daiko chapters around the world is a stylized version of the Japanese kanji for heart imposed over a circle in red and white. The logo symbolizes the spirit of Okinawan eisa taiko and friendship spreading around the world, a theme often promoted by the club. Performers wear a black and white uniform styled on a Chinese costume called mumunchinhata. The uniform includes a red and gold obi and hachimaki or sagi for members in high school and older. Younger performers wear pink. Adult performers who use only the paranku wear purple. There are a variety of other colored uniforms including purple, red and green worn by performers who are dancing special parts.

Marbury, Cheshire, present day He was born at Marbury, Cheshire, son of Thomas Merbury. The Talbot family who gained the title Earl of Shrewsbury were Lords of the Manor of Marbury. Laurence was always a staunch supporter of the Talbots in politics. Laurence served as High Sheriff of Cheshire in 1412. He appears to have enjoyed royal favour as early as 1399, being described as a \\"retainer for life \\" of the English Crown. He was granted an annuity from the customs of Drogheda.Ball, F. Elrington The Judges in Ireland 1221-1921 John Murray London 1926 He is first heard of in Ireland in 1402 when he was serving as Treasurer. From 1403 to 1410 he acted frequently as Deputy to the Lord Chancellor, Thomas Cranley who was often unable through old age, ill health or other duties to act as Chancellor. He acted as Deputy again in 1417, and was Treasurer in 1412-1413. O'Flanagan suggests that his record as Deputy was subject to criticism: when Cranley was asked to present a memorial to the Crown on the state of Government in Ireland, Merbury caused controversy by refusing to affix the Great Seal of Ireland to it, apparently on the ground that some of the complaints were directed against him personally.O'Flanagan J. Roderick \\"Lives of the Lord Chancellors and Keepers of the Great Seal of Ireland\\" 2 Volumes London 1870 Cranley was opposed by the \\"Patriotic Party\\", led by the powerful 4th Earl of Ormond. Several of its supporters were indicted by Talbot. In the meantime Sir Laurence Merbury refused to take the Memorandum of Complaints to London. As acting Chancellor of Ireland, Sir Laurence held the Great Seal, with the attendant authority.E.Wylie, \\"Henry V\\" (London 1938); H.Talbot, \\"Life of John Talbot\\" (1982.) Cranley always supported the English Viceroy. In 1420 Merbury witnessed the charter by which King Henry V guaranteed the liberties of the citizens of Dublin.Lucas, Charles The Great Charter of the Libertes of the City of Dublin Dublin 139 p.33 Otway-RuthvenOtway-Ruthven, A.J. A History of Medieval Ireland Barnes and Noble 1993 p.359 suggests that he was a victim of the Butler‚ÄìTalbot feud which dominated Irish politics for almost thirty years. The feud resulted in virtually all Irish public figures supporting either the Butler family, headed by James Butler, 4th Earl of Ormond, or the Talbot family, headed by John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury and his brother Richard Talbot, Archbishop of Dublin. Merbury was a supporter of the Talbots, naturally enough since he grew up on a Talbot manor, and as such was strongly attacked by the Ormond faction, including James Cornwalsh, the Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer, whom Merbury accused of grossly slandering him before the English Privy Council. Cornwalsh was suspended from office for a time but the fact that Merbury left Ireland soon after suggests that he was unable to withstand the attacks on his integrity.

In October 1907 Smith paid a visit to Ruskin College on behalf of a group of some of his university colleagues. He broached the idea of bringing Ruskin closer to the University, suggesting that this would involve the University providing funds for the College, and allowing Ruskin College students to join the University. Although this was warmly received by a couple of students, the bulk asked him what the University wanted in return. When he was unable to give a clear reply, the bulk of the students ‚Äì drawing on their experience as trade union negotiators ‚Äì became suspicious that the proposal would lead to the erosion of the college's independence. These concerns were vindicated when following a visit from Lord Curzon where the proposal was repeated and Dennis Hird, a lecturer in Sociology and Logic responded informing Curzon that as far as the students were concerned Ruskin College was irrevocably part of the Labour movement, which they envisaged making great changes in society presently. It subsequently transpired that certain members of the Ruskin College had been planning to sack Hird and to alter the curriculum by replacing Sociology and Logic with literature and temperance. Smith was important in developing history teaching.A. L. Smith archive, Balliol College, Oxford, UK. He was a close friend of the pomologist Ronald Hatton. Personal life In 1879, Smith married Mary Smith, with whom he had nine children. They first lived at 7 Crick Road in North Oxford until 1893. Their daughter Miriam married the diplomat Sir Reader Bullard. Smith's daughter Rosalind married Oxford historian Edward Murray Wrong. His youngest daughter Barbara married Sir Hugh Cairns the first Nuffield Professor of Surgery.

It contains a single species, Sinosaurosphargis yunguiensis. Life reconstruction of Sinosaurophargis yunguiensis Discovery Saurosphargis is known from several individuals, all of which were collected from Member II of the Guanling Formation, dating to the Pelsonian substage of the latest Anisian stage of the early Middle Triassic, about 243 million years ago. The holotype IVPP V 17040 and paratype IVPP V 16076 are housed at the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology in Beijing, and represent a nearly complete articulated skeleton and skull, and a partial disarticulated postcranial skeleton including dorsal vertebra, ribs, with osteoderms and gastral rib fragments, respectively. ZMNH M 8797, an incomplete postcranial skeleton showing a very well preserved right forelimb housed at the Zhejiang Museum of Nature History of Hangzhou, was also referred to Saurosphargis in its original description. The holotype and ZMNH M 8797 were collected at Yangmazhai of Luoping County, Yunnan Province, while the paratype came from Yangjian of Pan County, Guizhou Province. Additional uncatalogued LPV specimen was also referred to S. yunguiensis. These specimens all came from the Lagerst√§tte discovered during a 2007 geological mapping project with a diverse record of marine life called Luoping Biota, that yielded, apart from Sinosaurosphargis, various invertebrates, fish, basal ichthyosaurs, Atopodentatus, the basal saurosphargid Largocephalosaurus, and several species of eosauropterygian, including both pachypleurosaurs and nothosaurids. Etymology Sinosaurosphargis was first described and named by Chun Li, Olivier Rieppel, Xiao-Chun Wu, Li-Jun Zhao and Li-Ting Wang in 2011 and the type species is Sinosaurosphargis yunguiensis. The generic name is derived from Greek sino, meaning \\"China\\", sauros, meaning \\"lizard\\", and sphargis, the old genus name for the leatherback turtle, (in reference to the many similarities Sinosaurosphargis shares with Saurosphargis, a taxon whose holotype was lost and was thus considered a mystery), following the pattern of Sinosauropteryx. Like the name of Saurosphargis itself, it also refers to Sinosaurosphargis' dorsal osteoderm \\"body armor\\" and broadened ribs forming a closed chest rib basket - traits which are seemingly transitional between turtles and other reptiles. The specific name yunguiensis is derived from the names of the neighboring Yunnan and Guizhou Provinces, where the fossils were found. Description Sinosaurosphargis is a basal marine reptile, closely related to Saurosphargis from the Lower Muschelkalk of southwestern Poland and eastern Netherlands. Sinosaurosphargis possesses retracted external nostrils, and shows closed upper temporal fenestrae, and a ventrally open cheek. Its trunk region is short and rounded, and covered by a shield composed of small osteoderms, just like its neck and the proximal portions of all four limbs. Its back vertebrae show elongated, distally expanded transverse projections. The chest ribs are broadened and flat, contacting one another along their length, and forming a closed chest rib basket. Li et al. (2014) found some of these traits to be shared with all saurosphargids, while others are exclusive to Saurosphargis and Sinosaurosphargis. These genera have broader and flatter rib baskets than basal saurosphargids like Largocephalosaurus, and also transverse projections of back vertebrae and proximal portions of chest ribs that are much more robust, being much wider than the spacing between them. Phylogeny The following cladogram is simplified after the phylogenetic analysis of Li et al. (2011) and shows the placement of Sinosaurosphargis within Sauria. Ichthyopterygia was removed from the tree, as it caused a less resolved topology. Saurosphargis was coded solely based on the holotype, as the Netherlands material remains unprepared. Li et al. (2014) presented an updated version of the analysis above, showing interrelationships of all known Saurosphargidae species. The removal / inclusion of Ichthyopterygia was found to affect the topology the most - switching the positions of the Eusaurosphargis+Helveticosaurus and Thalattosauriformes clades, and altering the positions of several taxa within Eosauropterygia, which are not shown.

It is often used in contexts that promote advocacy on behalf of individual and consumer privacy rights in digital spheres, and is typically used in opposition to the business practices of many e-marketers/businesses/companies to collect and use such information and data. We are told our data is exposed and that we lack complete privacy. While our data is exposed through digital mediums, such as social media, we also more sensitized to privacy issues. The evolution between 2005 and 2011 of the level of disclosure for different profile items on Facebook shows that over the years, people want to keep more information private. Social networks have done the opposite: if we share more information, we expose more and Facebook can sell more to advertisers. Every 8 or 10 months, some social networks face privacy incidents which lead users to regroup and contest, however the networks usually apologize and continue on with the same information-mining tactics. When we share information with friends, their data are exposed and privacy decreases. This is a consequence of bridging social capital: as we create new and diverse ties on social networks, data becomes linked. This decrease of privacy continues until bundling appears (when the ties become strong and the network more homogenous). Privacy then increases through stagnation, creating a community where privacy can be reattained through mass. However, Facebook and other social media outlets find other ways for us to share information, for instance through games, top 10, quiz, etc. It makes what we can call \\"cycles of privacy\\".  Privacy Types  = Information Privacy = In the context of digital privacy, information privacy is the notion that individuals should have the freedom, or right, to determine how their digital information, mainly that pertaining to personally identifiable information, is collected and used. The EU has various laws that dictate how information may be collected and used by companies. Some of those laws are written to give agency to the preferences of individuals/consumers in how their data is used. In other places, like in the United States, privacy law is argued by some to be less developed in this regard. By example, some legislation, or lack of, allows companies to self-regulate their collection and dissemination practices of consumer information. = Communication Privacy = In the context of digital privacy, communication privacy is the notion that individuals should have the freedom, or right, to communicate information digitally with the expectation that their communications are secure; meaning that messages and communications will only be accessible to the sender's original intended recipient. However, communications can be intercepted or delivered to other recipients without the sender's knowledge, in a multitude of ways. Communications can be intercepted directly through various hacking methods, such as the man-in-the-middle attack(MITM). Communications can also be delivered to recipients unbeknownst to the sender due to false assumptions made regarding the platform or medium which was used to send information. An example of this is failure to read a company's privacy policy regarding communications on their platform could lead one to assume their communication is protected when it is in fact not. Additionally, companies frequently have been known to lack transparency in how they use information, this can be both intentional and unintentional. Discussion of communication privacy necessarily requires consideration of technological methods of protecting information/communication in digital mediums, the effectiveness and ineffectiveness of such methods/systems, and the development/advancement of new and current technologies. = Individual Privacy = In the context of digital privacy, individual privacy is the notion that individuals have a right to exist freely on the internet, in that they can choose what types of information they are exposed to, and more importantly that unwanted information should not interrupt them. An example of a digital breach of individual privacy would be an internet user receiving unwanted ads and emails/spam, or a computer virus that forces the user to take actions they otherwise wouldn't. In such cases the individual, during that moment, doesn't exist digitally without interruption from unwanted information; thus their individual privacy has been infringed upon.  Individual Privacy  Some internet users proactively work to ensure that their information can not be collected, this is the practice of attempting to remain anonymous. = Information Anonymity = The following examples are systems that allow a user to remain anonymous when accessing the web, and by extension the use of which better ensures the protection of their personally identifiable information. Onion Routing was originally developed by the U.S. Naval Research Lab and was intended to anonymize web traffic. The system created a path to any TCP/IP server by creating a pathway of onion routers. Once a pathway has been established, all information that is sent through it is anonymously delivered. When the user has finished utilizing the pathway it was essentially deleted which freed the resources to be used for a new pathway within Onion Routing. The Onion Routing project developed into what is today known as Tor, a completely open-sourced and free software. Unlike its predecessor, Onion Routing, Tor is able to protect both the anonymity of individuals as well as web providers. This allows people to set up anonymous web servers which in effect provides a censorship-resistant publishing service. = Communication Anonymity = The previously mentioned information anonymity systems can also potentially protect the contents of communications between two people, but there are other systems that directly function to guarantee a communication remains between only two people; they function to accomplish that only the intended recipient of a communication will receive it.Edman, M. and Yener, B. 2009. On anonymity in an electronic society: A survey of anonymous communication systems. ACM Comput. Surv. 42, 1, Article 5 (December 2009), 35 pages. DOI = 10.1145/1592451.1592456, http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1592451.1592456 One of these systems, PGP (which is an acronym for Pretty Good Privacy), has existed in various forms for many years. It functions to protect email messages by encrypting and decrypting them. It originally existed as a command-line-only program, but in recent years it has evolved to have its own full interface and a multitude of email providers offer built-in PGP support. Users can also install PGP-compatible software and manually configure it to encrypt emails on nearly any platform.Zimmermann, Philip R. (1999). \\"Why I Wrote PGP\\". Essays on PGP. Philip Zimmermann. SSL (acronym for Secure Sockets Layer) and TLS (acronym for Transport Layer Security) are measures to secure payments online. While these systems are not immune from breaches or failure, many users benefit greatly from their use as every major browser program has support for it built in. = Additional Services = There are additional methods that work to provide anonymity and by extension protect their data. Amongst these include services like IP address changers, in which an internet user typically pays a fee to utilize. Since IP addresses can frequently be traced back to a specific physical location, and likewise by extension can identify someone, the service helps users remain anonymous by providing access to a multitude of servers in various geographic locations around the world which allows the user to appear as if they are physically located in a selected area, even when they are not. This is an example of a method/service that works to allow for information and communication anonymity. The Virtual Private Network (VPN) is also a specific example. It is a technology that provides users secured connection over a non- secure public network such as the Internet through several VPN tunneling protocols, handling, and encapsulating traffic at different levels to ensure communication security. VPN is also effective in securing data and privacy over the cloud and data-center environments because it is capable of protecting IPs from exposure to different kinds of attacks. This technology can be categorized into SSL VPN and IPSec VPN, which are methods of data communication from a user device to a VPN gateway using a secure tunnel. There is also the case of the VHSP mechanism, which protects the exposure of an IP address by assigning a temporal IP for the VPN gateway and its services. The use of Network Address Translation or NAT allows users to hide connections passing through a gateway behind the gateway through the use of a sensible hiding IP address that is routable to the issuing gateway. = The (no) harm principle = One rule emitted by John Stuart Mill is the (no) harm principle. It explains that private references must be respected: one can do whatever he/she wants as long as the others don't suffer from the consequences of it. In our private space, alone, we are free to do whatever we want. Since media came up with photojournalism, the invasion of celebrities‚Äô private lives started and the right to privacy arose. In 1890, Samuel Warren & Louis Brandeis named it ‚Äúthe right to be left alone‚Äù.Today's ‚Äúprivacy incidents‚Äù don't exclusively concern celebrities and politicians since most of us are connected and share data: we are not online to be left alone. = The economic value of data = According to Alessandro Acquisti, Curtins Taylor and Liad Wagman in The Economics of Privacy, the individual data can be seen having two different types of value: a commercial value and a private value. The fact that data are collected can have both positive and negative effects: indeed, it can cause a violation of privacy and a monetary cost. Still according to those three researchers, the data analysis is becoming increasingly efficient, that is why there are more and more concerns about the progress of collecting data. Regulations are appearing, such as the EU data protection directive or the US children's online privacy protection act, but the industry is always evolving, so that it seems important to continue keeping an eye on the economics of privacy.  Privacy and Information Breaches  Methods can be purposely crafted to obtain one's personal information illegally. These directed attacks are commonly referred to as hacking, though that term refers to the general practice and doesn't address specific hacking methods and implementation. Various hacking methods as it pertains to the invasion of one's digital privacy are outlined below. As it pertains to intent, within hacking there are two categories of invasion: 1) Directed attacks against someone individually, and 2) Directed attacks against groups. With the latter category, however, a hacker could effectively obtain a specified/particular individual's information through first targeting a larger group. An example of this possibility could be as follows: If a hacker, named individual-A, wishes to obtain a particular person's information, individual-B, he/she could first target a platform or group that has individual-B's information already, such as a credit agency, or they could likewise target a group that individual-B has previously relinquished/provided their data to, like a social media network or a cloud based data service. Through targeting one of those groups, individual-A could effectively obtain individual-B's information by first hacking all data the group has, including the data of other individuals. Once obtained, the hacker could simply identify individual-B's information within the data and disregard the rest. = Example of an Individual Attack: Phishing = Phishing is a common method of obtaining someone's private information. This generally consists of an individual (often referred in this context as a hacker), developing a website that looks similar to other major websites that a target person commonly uses. The phishing website may look identical to the legitimate site, but its URL could be a variation in spelling or a different domain such as .org instead of .com. The target person can be directed to the site through a link in a 'fake' email that is designed to look like it came from the website he/she commonly uses. The user then clicks on the URL, proceeds to sign in, or provide other personal information, and as opposed to the information being submitted to the website that the user thought they were on, it is actually sent directly to the hacker. Phishing attacks commonly obtain bank and financial data as well as social networking website information. There are tools that can help users protect their information from phishing attacks and these include the Web browser extensions, which are capable of flagging suspicious websites and links.  Development and Controversy  Digital privacy is a trending social concern. For example, over the past decade, the usage of the phrase \\"digital privacy\\" has increased by more than fivefold in published books. https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=digital+privacy&year;_start=2009&year;_end=2019&corpus;=26&smoothing;=2 The TED talk by Eric Berlow and Sean Gourley subsequent to the 2013 mass surveillance disclosures cast a shadow over the privacy of cloud storage and social media. While digital privacy is concerned with the privacy of digital information in general, in many contexts it specifically refers to information concerning personal identity shared over public networks. Before the Edward Snowden disclosures concerning the extent of the NSA PRISM program were revealed in 2013, the public debate on digital privacy mainly centered on privacy concerns with social networking services, as viewed from within these services. Even after 2013, scandals related to social media privacy issues have continued to attract public attention. The most notable of these is the coverage of the Facebook‚ÄìCambridge Analytica data scandal in 2018, which led to a 66% decrease in public trust of Facebook. Trust in Facebook has dropped by 66 percent since the Cambridge Analytica scandal As the secrecy of the American Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act becomes widely disclosed, digital privacy is increasingly recognized as an issue in the context of mass surveillance. The use of cryptographic software to evade prosecution and harassment while sending and receiving information over computer networks is associated with crypto-anarchism, a movement intending to protect individuals from mass surveillance by the government.

Based on Angry Birds, Angry Birds Rio was released for devices using Apple's iOS and Mac OS X, as well as Google's Android in March 2011. The game was released as a marketing tie-in with the 20th Century Fox and Blue Sky Studios animated films Rio and Rio 2, and was promoted with those movies. While utilizing the same basic gameplay as the original game, Angry Birds Rio added a number of new elements, most notably the first use of boss levels. Gameplay In Rio, the Angry Birds have been kidnapped and taken to Rio. Just as in the original Angry Birds, players use a slingshot to launch birds at nearby structures, with the intent of hitting targets located on or within them. Instead of the pigs that have stolen eggs, players must now rescue caged exotic birds or defeat Nigel's marmosets, depending on the level being played. Because of the game's setting, several characters from Rio make appearances. Blu and Jewel both feature as types of bird exclusive to this game, along with all the existing birds from the series. The game also includes the first boss fights to appear in the series, when the player uses the birds to defeat Nigel, the main antagonist from the film, as well as Mauro, the leader of the marmosets. In other levels, Luiz helps defeat the marmosets and destroys materials and blocks to get the player extra points, as well as hidden items to collect as the player progresses through the game. Release Angry Birds Rio initially included two chapters, \\"Smugglers' Den\\" and \\"Jungle Escape\\", each with 30 levels. Since then, the game has been expanded with three additional 30-level chapters called \\"Beach Volley\\" (released in May 2011), \\"Carnival Upheaval\\" (released in June 2011), and \\"Airfield Chase\\" (released in August 2011) along with a 15-level chapter, \\"Golden Beachball\\", which is unlocked by finding a hidden item in \\"Beach Volley\\" (iOS, Android) or by entering a redeem code from Rio DVD (PC, Mac). A final chapter named \\"Smugglers' Plane\\" (released in November 2011) was released with initially with 15 levels, with the final 15 levels released later (January 2012). Each chapter has a special fruit that may be rarely found as gold. \\"Smugglers' Den\\" has pineapples, \\"Jungle Escape\\" has bananas, \\"Beach Volley\\" has watermelons, \\"Carnival Upheaval\\" has papayas, \\"Airfield Chase\\" has apples, \\"Smugglers' Plane\\" has mangoes, \\"Market Mayhem\\" has strawberries, and \\"Rocket Rumble\\" has golden rockets. In July 2013, the \\"Golden Beachball\\" episode received 15 more levels, golden cherries, a new background, and this episode is now available from the start of the game. In March 2012, the Trophy Room update was released, with 12 new levels that are each unlocked when a player finishes a chapter or collects all 15 of a certain golden fruit. This update was first released in the Android (Amazon Appstore ad-free) version before making its way to iOS. On December 18, 2012, a new update landed for iOS and Android adding 24 new levels. This levels are earned by getting from 30 to 70 stars on each episode or by earning 10 Mighty Eagles' Feathers on each episode (4 extra levels on each episode). This episode also added Power-Ups. The Power-Ups were Super Seeds and Sling Scope from the Angry Birds original app and 2 new power-ups (Samba Burst and TNT Drop, which this has been seen on a previous Angry Birds Friends Christmas Tournament). On March 11, 2013, another update was released, adding a \\"Market Mayhem\\" episode with 34 levels (3 stars levels and 1 Mighty Eagle level). On July 25, 2013, AB Rio's app icon was updated and Golden Beachball added a golden fruit and 15 new levels. In addition, The trophy room levels were combined into the episode they were earned from. Four Angry Birds Rio episodes ‚Äî all visually tied to Rio 2 was released from December 2013 to July 2014 and these episodes featured refreshed graphics. The Timber Tumble episode adds a hint feature that tells where to sling the bird. In the July 2015, a game update added bird coins that allow players to unlock levels that were previously locked. =Ports= At the 2012 Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles, California, Rovio and distribution partner Activision announced plans to bring Angry Birds Rio and two other games, the original Angry Birds and Angry Birds Seasons, to the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Nintendo 3DS systems. Bundled together as Angry Birds Trilogy, the games will be built specifically for their respectively angry bird consoles, taking advantage of their unique features, such as support for PlayStation Move, Kinect, high-definition displays, and glasses- free 3D visuals. It is also available for Wii and Wii U as part of Angry Birds Trilogy. Reception The game has received generally favorable reviews, with a Metacritic score of 87/100 based on 18 reviews. Ryan Rigney of GamePro saying the iOS version \\"boasts some notable improvements on its predecessors\\" and Levi Buchanan of IGN, in his review of the Android version, calling the game \\"a smart, snappy new chapter for the series\\". Jim Squires of Gamezebo complimented the game's attempts to add new material and mechanics, saying \\"some evolution needs to happen if it wants to have the long term staying power of a Mario or a Pac-Man.\\" However, Squires did take issue with the new boss battles, calling them \\"a little anti-climactic\\". Tracy Erickson of Pocket Gamer noted that \\"what Angry Birds Rio lacks in new ideas and freshness, it makes up in quality gameplay and good value\\". Since release, Angry Birds Rio has been downloaded more than 10 million times, and it has been one of the top downloaded games at both the Apple App Store and Google Play.

Georg Fein (1803‚Äì1869) was a German democratic journalist, an early German socialist and a liberal nationalist. He was a prominent publicist during the Vorm√§rz period that preceded the Revolution of 1848. Early life Georg Fein was born on 8 June 1803 in Helmstedt, into a wealthy middle-class family. His brother was the legal scholar Eduard Fein. Like his brother, Georg studied jurisprudence at the universities of G√∂ttingen, Heidelberg, Berlin and Munich, beginning in 1822. As a student he became involved in a radical fraternity that promoted democracy and unification of the German states. Fein was soon in trouble with the authorities and did not complete his law studies. In 1831 he became an editor of the liberal Deutsche Trib√ºne (German Tribune). Before it was outlawed in 1832, this was an influential liberal journal. In the early 1830s, Fein participated in several oppositional banquetsSince overt political demonstrations were illegal in most of Europe, a common tactic, adopted by oppositional forces in France, Germany and elsewhere, was to banquets, at which political speeches were disguised as toasts. He also helped organise workers' educational associations and wrote poems and song lyrics addressed to workers. Fein was soon under police surveillance and was arrested several times. In April 1833, a group of republican conspirators (including the labour leader Karl Schapper) carried out an unsuccessful uprising in Frankfurt, in which Fein was implicated. Facing arrest, he escaped to Switzerland. Exile In Zurich, Fein became an editor at the Neue Z√ºrcher Zeitung but was forced to resign because his articles were deemed too radical. In 1835 he joined 'Young Germany', a secret society modelled on Mazzini's 'Young Italy' and propagating a similar ideology of democracy, nationalism and social reform. Fein became a member of the Central Committee of Young Germany. In 1836, Fein was expelled from Switzerland and went to Paris, where he joined the utopian communist 'League of the Banned', founded by Wilhelm Weitling. On its behalf, Fein published the journal Der Ge√§chtete (The Banned). The League was subsequently renamed 'League of the Just' and later, under the influence of Karl Marx, the 'Communist League'. In France, Fein also befriended the exiled poets Heinrich Heine and Georg B√ºchner. In 1837, Fein was arrested and expelled from France. For the next seven years, Fein travelled widely across Europe, using a variety of aliases. He went first to London, where he organised a German-language reading circle for workers; subsequently he went to Oslo, Paris, Strasbourg and Switzerland. An inheritance had made Fein independently wealthy. He maintained good contacts with German oppositional figures, and published abroad several writings that had been banned by censors in Germany. Among these was an essay Hoffmann von Fallersleben had intended as an introduction to his Political Poems, together with a lengthy afterword by Fein. Johann Jacoby, a prominent German democrat, is thought to have provided Fein with a copy of the liberal essay Whence and Whither by Theodor von Sch√∂n, a former minister in Prussia, which Fein also published with a lengthy afterword. Deportation to the USA In 1844, Fein was back in Switzerland, participating in radical democratic circles. That year and in 1845, a group of Swiss liberals carried out armed invasions of the conservative canton of Lucerne. Fein participated on the side of the liberals but was captured and imprisoned in Lucerne. The liberal canton of Basel made him an honorary citizen, but his friends could not obtain his release. The authorities in Lucerne deported him to Austria, but the Habsburg government did not want him on its territory. After Norway and the state of Brunsvik both refused to take him, the Austrian chancellor, Metternich, decreed that Fein be deported to the United States of America. Fein arrived in the USA in 1846. In 1847, he held lectures in Philadelphia and Cincinnati on the history of the democratic movement in Germany since 1830. In Baltimore he founded the democratic club Concordia. Return to Europe The Revolution of 1848 brought Fein back to Germany, where he arrived in September. He became a member of the Democratic Association of Bremen and a delegate to the second Democratic Congress in Berlin in October 1848. On the initiative of Hermann Kriege, Fein was elected president of the congress but soon resigned that position. He remained a member of the organisational commission of the congress. In October 1848, Fein became engaged to Ernestine von K√∂nig, whom he married in 1849. As the Revolution wound down, Fein and his wife emigrated to Switzerland, where he spent the rest of his life. He mostly devoted himself to organising workers' educational associations. In 1859 he joined the German National Association, a party that united moderate democrats and liberal nationalists and advocated the formation of a liberal 'small Germany' under Prussian leadership (rather than a 'great Germany' under Austrian leadership). He became the party's representative in Switzerland. The German National Association split in 1866, with the left wing protesting against the party's increasingly conservative nationalism. The right wing was eventually absorbed into the National Liberal party. Fein's wife Ernestine died in 1862. Fein relocated from Liestal to Diessenhofen, Switzerland. There he wrote poetry and worked on his memoirs, which he had not completed when he died of a heart disease. Georg Fein died in Diessenhofen on 26 January 1869. Fein's literary remains were discovered in the State Archive of Lower Saxony in the 1980s. Sources *Lent, D., 'Fein, Georg.' In: Jarck, H.R., and G.

History West Brighton, Staten Island On May 8, 1902, the Actors Fund opened a home for retired entertainers on Staten Island, a borough of New York City, New York. In 1928, the New York City government took the property using eminent domain to enlarge an adjacent city park. That year, the residents were moved to the former mansion of American businesswoman Hetty Green in Englewood. The mansion was razed in 1959, and a modern facility was erected in 1961. In 1975, the facility was merged with the Percy Williams Home on Long Island, New York. The facilities were expanded in 1988 with a 50-bed nursing home. In the same year, the Edwin Forrest wing was created at the nursing home after a merger with the Edwin Forrest Home in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In 1993, a wing was named in honor of actress Natalie Schafer, notable for her role as Eunice \\"Lovey\\" Wentworth Howell on the television sitcom Gilligan's Island (1964-1967), who left $1.5 million to the Actors Fund after her death.

The Turkish Army used 40,000 troops to pursue 450 Kurdish guerillas led by Murat Karayƒ±lan. Turkish forces however failed to kill or capture Karayƒ±lan after they cornered him in Kulp, Diyarbakir, in May. During the first three days of the operation, there were clashes in Diyarbakir, Bing√∂l, Mu≈ü and Bitlis. Within Diyarbakir province, the clashes were concentrated around Kulp, Lice and Hani and in Bing√∂l Province, they were centered on Gen√ß. The military declared they killed 58 militants, captured 3 militants and lost 3 security forces during the first three days.

The church was constructed in 1970 but fell into disuse at the turn of the 21st century. History There had been a school chapel in Little Albany Street since 1857, replaced in 1938 by a new church in Seaton Place. The redevelopment of the area in the 1960s included provision for a new church on the corner of Laxton Place and Longford Street. Cardinal Heenan laid the foundation stone on 30 May 1970 and the church opened later that year. The UK's small Chaldean community started worshipping in the church in 1991 under the Right Rev Andreas Abouna. Worship continued until at least 2003, but the church had closed by 2011. Architecture The church was designed by Scott and Jaques. It has curving walls of dark brick, broken up by 17 tall windows. Trusses of prestressed concrete support a copper roof. The altar is stone, but the rest of the furnishings are wooden. Future In 2011, the Roman Catholic Church proposed that St Anne's be used as the principal church of the Personal Ordinariate of Our Lady of Walsingham for former Anglicans. Damian Thompson, the religious affairs commentator for The Daily Telegraph and a prominent supporter of the ordinariate, has rejected this proposal and has described St Anne's as a \\"cross between a public lavatory and a Christian Science Reading Room\\".

Clients include institutional investors, companies, financial institutions, (semi)public institutions, foundations, and high-net-worth individuals. It has been part of Dutch private bank Van Lanschot since 2007. History Kempen & Co was established in 1903 in Amsterdam by Arines Johannes Kempen with his companion Martinus Dirk de Lange as an independent stockbroker. The commodities exchange, the Beurs van Berlage had opened only a month before, and it was this exchange that was used by Kempen & Co for its trading. The company began by specialising in the trade of listed companies that operated in the Dutch East Indies. In 1952 Piet Harms, who had been with the firm since 1936, is promoted to co-head of the firm. After the departure of De Lange jr in 1968, Harms continues as sole head of the firm and is responsible for a period of significant growth. The customers at this time were mainly private investors. In 1972 the bank was sold to the British bank Slater Walker and then became the British bank's international division. After problems at Slater Walker two years later, the bank was sold to the Belgium firm Peterbroeck, Van Campenhout & Cie (Petercam N.V.). The bank continued to grow and got an exchange listing in 1983. The bank had by then built a strong reputation in investment banking, and in 1993 Joop Krant was made managing director. He directed the bank to European expansion with a focus on research and corporate finance activities. =Under ownership of Dexia= In 2001 the company was purchased by Belgian bank Dexia and delisted from the exchange. Dexia's ambition was to use Kempen & Co as its base for developing a strong presence in securities and capital markets in Europe. It was merged with Bank Labouchere which Dexia had acquired earlier. This gave the combined bank 1,250 employees. However, due to the differences in culture between the two banks and the Labourcher share-affair, the merger was quickly undone and by 2003 Kempen & Co was operating as an independent entity again within the Dexia group. A year later Kempen & Co becomes a separate company again after a management buyout of the company with the support of HAL Investments, Friesland Bank and NPM Capital. =Acquisition by Van Lanschot= In 2007 Dutch investment bank Van Lanschot acquired the company for ‚Ç¨300 million which saw the end of the independent Kempen & Co. HAL investments was also a major investor in Van Lanschot, and so helped arrange the deal in which it made approx ‚Ç¨46 million. Van Lanschot continued to use the Kempen & Co name but integrated the securities and asset management business into its own operations. Kempen & Co is a subsidiary of F. Van Lanschot Bankiers N.V. (Van Lanschot). As banks, Van Lanschot and Kempen & Co are subject to the supervision of De Nederlandsche Bank and have been issued licenses on the basis of Article 2.11 of the Dutch Financial Supervision Act (Wft).

Works Before working for Punch, Henning first contributed drawings to The Town. This was a paper known for reporting on scandals that was owned by Renton Nicholson and was published from 1837 to 1840. The Town frequently featured Henning‚Äôs drawings of notorious London residents on its front page. He often visited locations that were known for drawing lower class patrons and used what he saw there in his drawings, often depicting people who lived a Demimonde lifestyle. Henning later became one of the first employees of Punch in 1841. He continued working there until the summer of 1842. Henning contributed eleven drawings to the first volume and several more to the second. He also wrote for Punch, notably contributing several humorous valentines messages. In addition to his work on Punch, he also contributed drawings for several other publications and painted for the Post Office as well. In 1843 a magazine that employed Henning claimed that Punch had plagiarised some of his recently published work. He also produced artwork for one of Nicholson's later venture, the Garrick‚Äôs Head and Town Hotel. Henning painted portraits on the exterior of the hotel which portrayed London celebrities attending events inside. He also drew a large frieze to Apsley House in Hyde Park. Family Henning was the third son of the sculptor John Henning. Though his father was very punctual and focused on classical art, Archibald was known for his relaxed manner. He often focused his work on unrefined humour in the bohemian style. His brother in law Joseph Kenny Meadows was also an artist who contributed to Punch.

It was designed by Oscar Niemeyer in the Modern architectural style. Construction began on July 30, 1960, and the building was completed in 1966. Built in the shape of a truncated pyramid, it is the largest building in Brasilia designed by Niemeyer specifically for the arts. The building was closed for renovation in 1976, and was reopened on April 21, 1981. The National Theater is operated by Secretary of Culture of the Federal District and is home to three venues; the 60-seat Alberto Nepomuceno theater, the 407-seat Martins Pena theater, and the 1,407 seat Villa-Lobos theater. The complex also includes an exhibition gallery that is accessible to the public. The Theater has been under renovation for more than two years and remains closed to the public. History Construction of the theater was started on July 30, 1960. The building was structurally complete by January 30, 1961, but construction was then interrupted until early 1966. The Martins-Pena theater was opened on April 21, 1966, and was used for ten years until it was closed on September 4, 1976 during completion of the complex. Construction was completed by March 1979, and the Villa-Lobos theatre was opened with a concert conducted by Cl√°udio Santoro. The Martins-Pena theater was reopened on March 7, and the Alberto Nepomuceno theatre was opened on March 8. On December 1, 1979, the entire complex was closed again to complete renovations, and construction began on an annex which would include offices, rehearsal rooms, and galleries. The complex was reopened on April 21, 1981, and an annex was opened on June 24, 1981. The theatre was renamed Claudio Santoro National Theater on September 1, 1989, in honor of the Brazilian composer and violinist.  Renovation, closure to the public and other problems  Since January 2014, the National Theater began a long renovation process, not yet completed because of budgetary constraints and the lack of governmental prioritization concerning the matter. Also, due to the low stream of people in the immediate vicinity of the Theater and to the absence of security and surveillance, the external part of the building has become a spot for drug use.

In 1997, he joined Ken McCulloch, boutique chain operator for the Malmaison Group as general manager of the newly acquired Newcastle site. Shortly after that, he became Operations Director for the group. In 2000, he left Malmaison to work with McCulloch on the Columbus Hotel in Monte Carlo, a project in conjunction with Formula One racing driver David Coulthard. In 2004, Cook returned to Malmaison as chief executive officer. Marylebone Warwick Balfour, the group's owners, then purchased the Hotel du Vin collection of boutique hotels.

Skiers and snowboarders should be practiced in tree skiing and aware of the dangers involved, and comfortable on experts-only mogul skiing runs such as Steeplechase before attempting. Location Temerity encompasses all the terrain between the Steeplechase runs and the Highlands Bowl - that is, between Kessler's and the Y-Zones. Temerity is serviced by the Loge Peak and Deep Temerity lifts. From the top of these head south (further up the mountain), either along the Dorksacker traverse through the trees or along the ridge that defines the top of the mountain. Drop in anywhere in the forest, and you are skiing in Temerity. Entering from the ridge affords the opportunity of skiing the area above the traverse, which is often wonderfully untracked. The ridge can be hiked, but a complimentary snowcat also runs along it to the edge of the Temerity forest. The snowcat picks up only a hundred yards from the top of Loge Peak lift and picks up every twenty minutes from 10:30am until 2:30pm, weather and conditions permitting.http://www.aspensnowmass.com/images/dyn/trailmaps/jpg- High/highlands.html. The Runs Temerity is remarkable for the sheer length and constantly steep pitch of its gladed runs. The shortest runs drop about 1690 vertical feet. The terrain includes glades of varying density, former avalanche chutes, and steep open clearings. The main runs are - in order from North to South - Lucky Find, South Castle, Mushroom, Canopy Cruiser, and Hyde Park. History The Temerity area has been inside the Aspen Highlands permit area boundary since that permit was first granted in 1958, and even back then it was clear that the forest near Loge Peak would make for excellent steep tree skiing if it could be done safely. The principal issue was the safety of the dangerous avalanche chutes cutting through the forest, which would have to be controlled before commercial skiers could traffic the area. Also, the forest is in many places too dense for most skiers and would have to be thinned out. Hope came for the actualization of opening Temerity in the 77-78 season, when the natural avalanche chutes of Steeplechase opened. Steeplechase was made safe by a bootpacking program whereby hikers were paid to march up and down the slopes, mashing down the early-season snow so it would hold throughout the season. Constant skier traffic effectively mashed down the subsequent layers of snow so that avalanche conditions would never be reached. However, due to the expense associated with opening it, Temerity was not to be opened for another eighteen years. The tree removal was an expensive process, as the trees had to be removed by helicopter so as not to damage rest of the forest. Finally, before the 95-96 season the bootpacking and tree removal were accomplished, and Temerity was open. Initially, however, the runs were much shorter than they are now because no lift serviced the area. A long catwalk called the OK traverse brought skiers back to Steeplechase's Grand Traverse, which brought them back to the bottom of Loge Peak lift. That unfortunate arrangement changed in the 05-06 season with the opening of the Deep Temerity lift, which approximately doubled the length of the Temerity and Steeplechase runs, allowing skiers to ski much more terrain and traverse much less. Deep Temerity, a triple chair that rises ., also makes much more of the Highlands Bowl accessible. The opening of Deep Temerity was a landmark event for the Aspen Skiing Company because it opened up so much experts-only terrain, and it hoped to establish Aspen as a center for extreme skiing. Posters were issued with the slogan, \\"Aspen Goes Deep.\\" Naming Temerity was named by highlands ski patroller Alan Schmidt, who did much of the research work involved in opening it. The area was named for the outrageousness of opening avalanche chutes to the public. Temerity: Boldness, to the point of being foolish. Environmental Impact The opening of Temerity has disrupted the natural functioning of the avalanche chutes that cut through the forest. Powerful avalanches would rip through the chutes periodically, destroying trees on the edges of the chutes and at the bottom. Now that the avalanches have stopped, trees have begun to grow closer into the chutes.

He was a pioneer of the German labour movement and a figure in early German socialism. Moll was an early associate of Karl Marx. Early life Joseph Maximilian Moll was born in Cologne on October 14, 1813. He was born into a poor working-class family and was apprenticed as a watchmaker. After his apprenticeship Moll travelled widely across Europe in search of work, as was customary for tradesmen at the time. On these travels he made contact with a number of German workers' associations, which exposed him to radical political and economic ideas. Young Germany In 1834 he joined the secret society 'Young Germany' in Switzerland. Modelled on Mazzini's 'Young Italy', it advocated a similar mixture of democratic democracy, nationalism and social reform. His friendship with the labour organiser and revolutionary Karl Schapper dated from that period. In 1836, Moll was expelled from Switzerland and went to Paris, where he joined the 'League of the Just', then under the influence of the utopian communist Wilhelm Weitling. Schapper was also a member. The League of the Just In 1839, the League participated in an insurrection carried out by the 'Society of the Seasons', led by Armand Barb√®s and Auguste Blanqui. The insurrection was suppressed and Moll escaped to Britain. In 1840 he was one of the founders of the German Workers' Educational Association in London. In 1846 he became a member of the Central Committee of the League of the Just (which had been relocated to London). Under the influence of Karl Marx, who replaced Weitling as the ideological leader of the group, the League was re-organised as the 'Communist League'. Moll was again elected to its Central Committee. Revolution and death When the Revolution of 1848 broke out in Europe, Moll returned to Germany. He went to Cologne, where he became president of the Workers' Association and helped propagate Marxist ideas among its members. In September 1848 he was implicated in an uprising; to escape arrest, he fled to London, but later returned illegally to Germany. In May 1848, he participated in the democratic revolution in Baden and took an active part in the fighting. On June 28, 1849, he was killed in Rotenfels, near Murg. Significance Moll was an important figure in the early German labour movement, playing a role in organising several workers' associations. He was an early associate of Karl Marx and a figure in the transition from the early artisan communism of Wilhelm Weitling and the insurrectionary tactics of Auguste Blanqui and Marxism. A street in Berlin (Mollstra√üe) is named after him. Sources *Beloussowa, N., 'Joseph Moll'. In: Marx und Engels und die ersten proletarischen Revolution√§re.

At the age of 11 years old, she made history as the first female quarterback in the 56th Annual Pop Warner Super Bowl (Junior Pee Wee division); however, her team, the Harvey Colts, lost in the semifinals. The 2008 film The Longshots is adapted from her experience, with her being portrayed by Keke Palmer.  Football  In spring 2001, 8 year old Jasmine started playing tackle football with others in her neighborhood. Her mother, Cassandra Johnson, learned of this when Jasmine severely injured her knee while playing, requiring 23 stitches. A few weeks later, Jasmine returned to playing football in the neighborhood park. Her uncle, Fred Johnson, noticed Jasmine's ability to throw a football with a tight spiral and quite a bit of velocity. After difficult negotiations with her mother, Fred enrolled Jasmine into the Pop Warner program. After spending her first year on the bench, Jasmine was taken by her uncle to the Mighty Mite division (7-to-9-year-olds) Harvey Colts, the team he was coaching, and made her the starting quarterback. Upon her arrival, her teammates did not welcome her but they quickly change their minds when they started winning games. As the team continued to win under the leadership of Jasmine, coach Johnson decided to play her as a linebacker because she was fast and strong for her age and size (she was 4-foot-9 and 90 pounds at the time). The Colts finished the regular season with a perfect record before losing in the regionals. The next year, Jasmine moved to the Harvey Colts of the Junior Pee Wee division. Now coached by Jim Stovall, Jasmine and the Harvey Colts won 8 of 9 games of the regular season and won their regional playoffs to earn a trip to the Pop Warner Super Bowl in December 2003. Despite losing the final 13-2 against the Southeast Apaches (Texas), the Colts won their consolation match against Hawaii's Kailua Mustangs with a score of 14-0. Jasmine both threw and ran for a touchdown in the win. Jasmine left Pop Warner football after five years.  Today  After football, Jasmine played on the women's basketball team of Joliet West High School in the position of point guard. She hopes to one day become a professional basketball or football player.

Carone is an estate vineyard/winery and distillery owned by Anthony Carone and Sarah Hoodspith. The winery focuses on planting vitis vinifera and European crossed red grape vines. The winery has won international medals for their red wines and most recently released the first ever 100% Quebec grown Pinot noir wine. In August 2019, the winery expanded to craft distillation focusing on spirits produced exclusively from its grapes for a farm-to-flask approach. Anthony Carone Anthony Carone (born 1 August 1965) is the owner and winemaker of Vignoble Carone Wines. Born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada to Italian immigrant parents, Anthony was introduced to winemaking at a young age. He started making wine at the age of 5 and in his late 20s Anthony began studying winemaking with the Amateur Winemakers of Ontario (AWO) in the mid-1990s.http://www.littlefatwino.com/quebecwinetasting.html In the end of the 1990s Anthony, alongside his parents, began converting land they owned from fruits and vegetables to a vineyard. Based on his successful grape growing and winemaking, in 2000, Anthony was asked by LittleFatWino, Larry Paterson to present data on various cold climate grape varieties to a group of Ontario winemakers. While planting a vineyard Anthony continued to make wine. In 2003, Anthony won his first winemaking medal at the Ontario club level and proceeded to win regional, provincial and national medals for winemaking at the amateur level. In 2005, Anthony became the first Quebec resident ever to have won a medal at the AWO provincial level  it was a medal for a Pinot Noir red wine.http://www.littlefatwino.com/awc2005results.html After having made a name for himself amongst the Ontario winemaking community, Anthony looked closer to home and with two other avid amateur winemakers, he founded the Association des Vinificateurs Amateur du Qu√©bec (AVAQ - Amateur winemakers of Quebec) chapter of the Amateur Winemakers of Canada where he remains the Vice-President. In 2005, Anthony's dream of owning a winery became a reality as Vignoble Carone Wines received its winemaking permit. Today Anthony is known best as the first winemaker to have won international medals for 100% Quebec grown red wines.

Pope Benedict XVI's visit to the United States took place from April 15, 2008 to April 20, 2008. It was his only visit to the United States. It was officially titled the \\"Apostolic Visit to the United States of America and to the Seat of the United Nations\\". It was the sixth official papal visit to the United States since the U.S. established full diplomatic relations with the Holy See in 1984. In addition to his 1979 visit, Pope John Paul II visited the United States in 1987, 1993, 1995, and 1999. Pope Francis visited the United States in 2015. The Pope's visit included meetings with President George W. Bush, an address to the United Nations General Assembly in New York City, a visit to Ground Zero, and Masses at Nationals Park in Washington, D.C. and Yankee Stadium in New York City, among other activities. Preparation The visit was announced on November 12, 2007 by Archbishop Pietro Sambi to the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops.

The crowd sang \\"Happy Birthday\\" to the Pope, who turned 81 years old that day. The Pope addressed the crowd in English, saying he had \\"great respect for this vast pluralistic society\\" and ended by saying \\"God bless America\\". In his speech, Bush said the visit was a reminder to Americans to \\"distinguish between simple right and wrong\\", saying, \\"We need your message to reject this dictatorship of relativism and embrace a culture of justice and truth.\\" He told the Pope that in America, \\"you'll find a nation that welcomes the role of religion in the public square...[I]n a world where some evoke the name of God to justify acts of terror and murder and hate, we need your message that God is love. And embracing this love is the surest way to save man from falling prey to the teaching of fanaticism and terrorism.\\" After the ceremony, Bush and the Pope met in the Oval Office, where Bush presented him with a birthday cake. During their private meeting in the Oval Office, the Pope expressed his concerns to Bush about the Iraq War and illegal immigration in the country.

Women were not allowed to participate in the elections. Women campaigned for the right to participate in the official elections and planned to create parallel municipal councils. Background Municipal elections were originally planned to be held on 31 October 2009 in Saudi Arabia. The elections were not held in 2009. Governmental authorities stated that the delay was caused by the need to \\"expand the electorate and study the possibility of allowing women to vote.\\" Associated Press described the announcement that an election would be held in 2011 as having \\"coincided with rumblings of dissent in Saudi Arabia stemming from the wave of political unrest in the Arab world.\\" On 22‚Äì23 March 2011, officials of the Ministry of Municipal and Rural affairs announced that the elections would be held on 22 September 2011. Half of the local council seats were to be decided in the election and the other half were to be appointed. The councils have \\"little power\\". Electoral process Voter registration took place from 23 April to 19 MayEarly reports stated 23 April as the election date. or 28 July. Candidate registration took place from 28 May to 2 June. The period of electoral campaigning was to be decided after candidate registration had closed. The municipal councils were to be created in October, following the election, for a term of 6 years. Electoral commission The Ministry of Municipal and Rural affairs set up an 11-member electoral commission, headed by Abdul-Rahman al-Dahmash and an executive committee that \\"will facilitate the operations of the special electoral commission, and [will] take all the necessary measures to ensure the success of the municipal elections.\\" Women's participation In late March, the Ministry of Municipal and Rural affairs stated that women would not vote in the 2011 elections \\"because of the kingdom's social customs\\". King Saud University history lecturer and human rights activist Hatoon al-Fassi involved in campaigning for women's participation in elections stated that women had decided to create their own municipal councils in parallel to the men-only elections. Al-Fassi stated that women creating their own municipal councils or participating in \\"real elections\\" were both legal under Saudi law and electoral commission head al- Dahmash agreed with her. Saudi Arabian women organised through the \\"Baladi\\" (My Country) and Saudi Women's Revolution to campaign for women's participation in the election. From 23‚Äì25 April, women in Jeddah, Riyadh and Dammam tried to register as electors. The Gulf News said that \\"strong public opinion ... supporting women's participation in the election process\\" followed local newspapers' publication of photos of women waiting in queues to register for the election. Fawzia Al Hani, chair of the \\"Baladi\\" Facebook campaign, said that Saudi Arabian law states that women have the right to vote and to stand as candidates. One of the women whose registration had been rejected, Samar Badawi, filed a lawsuit in the Grievances Board, a non-Sharia court, against the Ministry of Municipal and Rural affairs, claiming that there was no law banning women as voters or candidates and that the refusal was illegal. She cited Articles 3 and 24 of the Arab Charter on Human Rights, which refer to general and election-specific anti-discrimination, respectively. Badawi requested the Grievances Board to suspend the electoral procedures pending the Board's decision and to order the electoral authorities to register her as a voter and as eligible to be a candidate. On 27 April 2011, the Grievances Board accepted to hear her case at a later date. The Board's final decision was that Badawi's case was \\"premature\\". According to the United States Department of State, Badawi was the first person to file a lawsuit for women's suffrage in Saudi Arabia. Badawi also applied to the Municipal Elections Appeal Committee to reverse the refusal of her registration. Her application was refused on the grounds that appeals against registration refusals must take place within three days of the refusal. In an annual speech on 25 September 2011 before the Shura Council, King Abdullah stated that Saudi women would be able to run and cast ballots in the 2015 municipal elections.Saudi king: Women can vote in local elections USA Today. 25 September 2011.

Though no PDPs have been formally and openly adopted by any governmental entity, there is significant work being done by scientists and nongovernmental organizations to develop cohesive plans of action to utilize in the event of detection. The most popular and well known of these is the ‚ÄúDeclaration of Principles Concerning Activities Following the Detection of Extraterrestrial Intelligence\\", which was developed by the International Academy of Astronautics (IAA), with the support of the International Institute of Space Law.Billingham, John et al. 1999. Social Implications of the Detection of an Extraterrestrial Civilization (SETI Press, Mountain View, CA). The theories of PDPs constitute a distinct area of research but draw heavily from the fields of SETI (the Search for Extra- Terrestrial Intelligence), METI (Messaging to Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence), and CETI (Communication with Extraterrestrial Intelligence). Scientist Zbigniew Paptrotny has argued that the formulation of post-detection protocols can be guided by three factors: terrestrial society's readiness to accept the news of ET detection, how the news of detection is released, and the comprehensibility of the message in the signal. These three broad areas and their related subsidiaries comprise the bulk of the content and discourse surrounding PDPs. Issues =Significance of transmission= There are two proposed scales for quantifying the significance of transmissions between Earth and potential extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI). The Rio Scale, ranging from 0 to 10, was proposed in 2000 as a means of quantifying the significance of a SETI detection. The scale was designed by Iv√°n Alm√°r and Jill Tarter to help policy-makers formulate an initial judgment on a detection's potential consequences. The scale borrows heavily from the Torino Scale, which is used to categorize the hazard of impact of near-earth objects (NEOs). The IAA SETI Permanent Study Group officially adopted this scale both as a means of bringing perspective to claims of ETI detection and as an acknowledgement that even false ETI detections could have disastrous consequences, which should be mitigated.IAA SETI Permanent Study Group: Rio Scale. Setileague.org (2006-09-29). Retrieved on 2011-04-09. A closely related metric is the San Marino Scale for quantifying potential hazard of deliberate transmissions from Earth. While the Rio Scale rests on the relatively well- accepted science of the search for extraterrestrial signals (SETI), the San Marino scale seeks to bring objectivity to the reciprocal enterprise ‚Äì that of human civilization sending transmissions that could be found by extraterrestrial civilizations (METI). The San Marino Scale was first proposed in 2005 and was adopted by the IAA SETI Permanent Study Group in September 2007.IAA SETI Permanent Study Group: San Marino Scale. Setileague.org. Retrieved on 2011-04-09. =Nature of detection= Despite widespread belief, there is no empirical knowledge concerning extraterrestrial life forms and civilizations. The implications of a detection of extraterrestrial life would vary greatly depending on the nature of that life, its location, and how human society reacts. Because of this lack of certainty, PDPs consider a variety of scenarios and the appropriate reactions. The formulation of a cohesive plan for a response to the detection of ETI would involve the development of scenario-contingent strategies for managing the discovery and its consequences. Some scenarios have received more attention than have others. For example, while a sizable amount of work has been done to predict the consequences of a radio telescope detection of ETI elsewhere in our galaxy, very little such effort has been used to identify the consequences of discovering single-celled life forms elsewhere in the Solar System. Confirmation of such fossilized or living organisms on a nearby planet or moon could still have acute effects on individuals‚Äô world-views and raise many ethical and practical issues.Dick, Steven K. ‚ÄúResponse to the Discovery of Extraterrestrial Life.‚Äù (1999). Workshop on the Societal Implications of Astrobiology: Final Report. Ames Research Center: NASA Technical Memorandum (Final Report revised on January 20, 2001). =Cultural and political considerations= Regardless of the nature of a confirmed detection, PDPs also place considerable emphasis on the range of likely reactions from different constituencies, including the press, various religious groups, political leaders, and the general public. The differences in reactions across the range of cultural and religious boundaries would be substantial. One possible strategy for development of more comprehensive PDPs is to undertake carefully planned cross-cultural polls and other empirical studies based on analogues in the humanities and history, the social and behavioral sciences, and even science fiction to determine likely reactions. Shortly after a confirmed detection, the timely application of relevant interdisciplinary data is likely to prove invaluable in implementing the appropriate policy as well as in the delivery of educational and public relations initiatives particular to the situation at hand.Vakoch, Douglas A. ‚ÄúPredicting Reactions to the Detection of Life beyond Earth.‚Äù (1999). Workshop on the Societal Implications of Astrobiology: Final Report. Ames Research Center: NASA Technical Memorandum (Final Report revised on January 20, 2001). Another potential strategy is to explore the capacity of religion as a ‚Äúresource to absorb the impact of discovery and to maintain beneficial relations with ETI.‚ÄùHarrison, Albert A., and Kathleen Connell (Eds.) (1999). Workshop on the Societal Implications of Astrobiology: Final Report. Ames Research Center: NASA Technical Memorandum (Final Report revised on January 20, 2001). PDPs also attempt to take into account the political aftermath of a detection and the ways in which both governmental and nongovernmental entities might use information. As Michael Michaud states, ‚ÄúWe cannot assume that SETI is immune from the ancient motivations of egoism, power, and greed. Decisions that could affect the welfare of the human species might be made by small, non-representative elites.‚Äù Once detection becomes public, decision-makers would exert influence by the way they evaluate the importance and handle the publicity of the discovery. It is possible that such actors would emphasize or minimize its importance to extract political advantage. The contact could be framed as a positive development that will benefit the nation and humankind. Likewise, it could be used to warn of potential dangers and provoke public anxieties. Each course of action would have profound effects on how the press and the general public react. Michaud posits that the more decipherable the information received from contact with ETI, the higher a chance there is for political reaction against alien cultural influences. Extremist groups, both religious and secular, could weigh in, attacking information from ETI as evil or immoral. It is possible that this would spark attempts to terminate communication by interfering with the signal or targeting the detecting technology with attacks. Albert Harrison has written that it would be ‚Äúfoolish and negligent‚Äù to fail to anticipate such reactions in the formulation of policies and plans.Albert A. Harrison, ‚ÄúRethinking our Place in the Universe: Exploring the Societal Implications of NASA‚Äôs Astrobiology Program,‚Äù Space Times, January‚ÄìFebruary 2002, 4‚Äì9, 6. =Information sharing= Following a confirmed detection, another important variable considered in a PDP is the speed with which the facts of the discovery would become public knowledge. For instance, should a signal of ET origin be sufficiently ambiguous or otherwise difficult to interpret, the detecting party may perceive a need to withhold information about the discovery to prevent unintended reactions from the general public or other political entities. Likewise, the detecting party could choose to limit information release in a bid to exploit the contact for personal gain. At the international level, the PDP of a national government entity would have the force of law to prevent, delay, or limit the release of information ‚Äì especially if the detection is made by persons working for that agency or under government contract. This sort of information restriction scenario is more likely under circumstances in which the detecting party was the only holder of the technological capabilities required to communicate. The subsequent disclosure of those decisions could provoke international distrust, encouraging other nations to act unilaterally in their communication with ETI. =Signal comprehensibility and content= Depending on the nature of the first detection, policy- or decision-makers might have the opportunity to make a conscious decision about composing and sending a message. The ambiguity and content of signals sent both to and from Earth would have profound implications for what actions needed to be taken. A PDP that did not take signal comprehensibility into account would not be flexible enough to inform appropriate action. The area of SETI research known as CETI (Communication with Extraterrestrial Intelligence), is concerned with how humankind should carry out this communication and, to some extent, representation problems such as whether a response should be with one collective voice or if anyone with access to a transmitter should have the right to communicate. The purpose and content of a response is also an issue that PDPs seek to make explicit. There is considerable disagreement as to how to effectively communicate meaning and intent across what would likely be formidable language barriers. The message would need to be crafted in such a way that its content and delivery were unambiguous to receivers that may not even use written or verbal communication. Several mathematic, pictorial, algorithmic, and \\"natural\\" language theories have been developed and applied to the problem of CETI. A specific purpose or goal of outgoing transmissions may be covered by a PDP as well. Several possible functions exist, including: a description of our species and planet, a request for information, and/or the proposition of some course of action. However, in the absence of an intergovernmental agreement or structures for building consensus on the subject, nations, groups, businesses and individuals are free to act autonomously. It is precisely because the process of sculpting a collective message would be slow and laborious (but intensely important), that most scientists recommend having a PDP with some prescribed action laid out before contact is made. =Relative technological capabilities= In considering post-detection courses of action, it is also useful to consider the relative technological capabilities both in relation to signal relay time and in relation to whether or not the ETI is thought to pose a militaristic threat. If the ETI in question is transmitting from outside the Solar System, there will be a significant lag in time between transmission and receipt by either party. The relative sophistication of the communication technology available to each party would play heavily into the feasibility of certain types and content of messaging. In a similar vein, the potential disparities in sophistication of weapons technology hold grave implications for how humankind should react to ETI. Due to the perceived risk of revealing the precise location of the Earth to alien civilizations, METI has been heavily criticized as irresponsible considering the lack of information available about any real or potential ETI threat. Even in the likely scenario that accurate locational coordinates of Earth were available, there is question as to whether humankind should reveal anything more about itself that could be a boon to hostile ETI. Notable among the critics of METI were the (late) British theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking and includes science fiction author David Brin. Adopted and Proposed PDPs =The Brookings Report= \\"Proposed Studies on the Implications of Peaceful Space Activities for Human Affairs,\\" often referred to as \\"the Brookings Report,\\" was a 1960 report commissioned by NASA and created by the Brookings Institution in collaboration with NASA's Committee on Long-Range Studies. In a section titled, \\"The implications of a discovery of extraterrestrial life,\\" the report considers possible post-detection scenarios and gives recommendations. Aimed at the political leadership that would be in a decision-making role immediately following a confirmed detection, it describes, among other things, the circumstances under which it may or may not be advisable to withhold such information from the public. The significance of this relatively small section of the report is a matter of controversy. As more of an analysis of fallout and pertinent considerations than an explicit PDP, the report does not specifically recommend a cover-up of evidence of extraterrestrial life. This possibility, however, is the context in which the Brookings report is often cited by ufologists and conspiracy theorists. =IAA SETI Declaration of Principles= The IAA, in an attempt to draw up universal guidelines on the immediate steps to be taken by the group or individual that makes a discovery, drafted the \\"Declaration of Principles Concerning Activities Following the Detection of Extraterrestrial Intelligence\\".\\"Declaration of Principles Concerning Activities Following the Detection of Extraterrestrial Intelligence\\" ar setileague.org. The document has been endorsed by six international professional space societies and also constitutes an informal agreement among most of those carrying out SETI. The declaration proposes a set of nine post-detection protocols, listed below. > #International consultations should be initiated to consider the question of > sending communications to extraterrestrial civilizations. #Consultations on > whether a message should be sent, and its content, should take place within > the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space of the United Nations and > within other governmental and non-governmental organizations, and should > accommodate participation by qualified, interested groups that can > contribute constructively to these consultations. #These consultations > should be open to participation by all interested States and should be > intended to lead to recommendations reflecting a consensus. #The United > Nations General Assembly should consider making the decision on whether or > not to send a message to extraterrestrial intelligence, and on what the > content of that message should be, based on recommendations from the > Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space and from governmental and non- > governmental organizations. #If a decision is made to send a message to > extraterrestrial intelligence, it should be sent on behalf of all Humankind, > rather than from individual States. #The content of such a message should > reflect a careful concern for the broad interests and wellbeing of Humanity, > and should be made available to the public in advance of transmission. #As > the sending of a communication to extraterrestrial intelligence could lead > to an exchange of communications separated by many years, consideration > should be given to a long-term institutional framework for such > communications. #No communication to extraterrestrial intelligence should be > sent by any State until appropriate international consultations have taken > place.

He is known for his work with experimental and alternative rock bands including 1990s UK acts Delicatessen and Lodger, and more recently with bands and collaborations including Vedette, Shoosh, 5 Little Elephants, Me Me the Moth, Chicanery, and Three on a Match. His lyrics reflect the influence of DaDa and James Joyce, and his voice has a unique, multifaceted, \\"strangely alluring\\" character.\\"cd reviews\\" Reverb Magazine Issue 19 February 2008 page 22 Carlill founded the group Delicatessen in Leicester, England in 1993, and joined the British supergroup Lodger in 1998. Both groups charted in the UK, with Lodger's single, I'm Leaving, charting in the top 40. Lodger disbanded after one album, 1998's A Walk in the Park. Delicatessen, having released three critically acclaimed albums, broke up in late 2002. During the late 1990s, Carlill also contributed to TV Mania, a side project of Duran Duran members Nick Rhodes and Warren Cuccurullo. Having relocated to the United States in 2000, Neil Carlill temporarily slowed his musical output until, in 2004, he resumed working with Warren Cuccurullo, this time on the eponymous debut album from the project titled Chicanery. During this period he also founded the bands Vedette, Shoosh, 5 Little Elephants, Me Me the Moth, and Three on a Match through collaborations with numerous musicians in the US and Europe. He has also developed a solo project dubbed Airport Studies, and performs live under the pseudonym Harvey Mapcase. As Airport Studies, Carlill contributed a song for the Fire Records James Joyce Tribute album, Chamber Music (James Joyce). Under his own name Carlill was a featured vocalist on Lost-Wax (2008 Plush) by Lena and the Floating Roots Orchestra. Some of Neil Carlill's written work was also published in 2007 in Galleon (Volume 1, Number 1), a literary journal that features adventurous short fiction. Delicatessen Delicatessen was formed by Neil Carlill (vocals, guitar, keyboards), Craig Bown (guitar, flute), Pete Capewell (bass) and Stuart Dayman (drums), taking their moniker from the 1991 French film. They started in Leicester, England in 1993 and while playing shows in London they were spotted by manager Tony Beard, and soon started to garner support from the Melody Maker and much of the UK music press. After signing to Starfish Records, the Indie offshoot of Jazz Summers' Big Life Publishing, their debut single Inviting Both Sisters Out To Dinner was released in October 1994, followed by the single C.F. Kane in April 1995. In a Melody Maker review of C.F. Kane, the reviewer placed Delicatessen in the class of bands that were \\"influenced by good books or good films, rather than just their late-Sixties record collections.\\"Taylor Parkes ‚ÄúSingles‚Äù review of CF Kane \\"Melody Maker\\" 1 April 1995 page 34 top left Subsequently, their single, I'm Just Alive charted.the Zobbel website click on \\"Chart Log UK\\" at \\"CLUK 1994‚Äì2008 Artist Index\\" click on ‚ÄúD‚Äù and scroll to \\"Delicatessen\\" Delicatessen also created the soundtrack to the Independent short film George and Ramona (starring Emily Dux and Gary Lydon, written by David Hill and Mika Kallwass) that was released in 1995. The first album, Skin Touching Water, was released to stellar reviews in May 1995. Melody Maker called the band \\"The salvation of pop music\\".\\"Melody Maker\\" May 1995 Early in 1995, bassist Pete Capewell left and was replaced by the multi-instrumentalist Will Foster. That summer saw Delicatessen headlining the 3rd stage at Reading Festival, and the addition of Jonny Wood on keyboards, percussion, backing vocals, and violin. With their live band complete, they toured in the Netherlands, Germany and France, and were featured at the Phoenix Festival in 1995. The second album Hustle into Bed, characterised as a darker, more orchestral work, was issued in 1996, produced by longtime Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds and The Birthday Party producer/engineer Tony Cohen. After a great deal more touring there was a brief hiatus in which the Lodger 'supergroup' came about, and then Delicatessen reappeared in early 1998 with a new label, Viper Records, and a third album, There's No Confusing Some People. Carlill and Foster then continued with the Lodger project for the rest of 1998. Following Lodger's split, Carlill emigrated to the US, and despite attempts by him, Bown, and Dayman to keep recording, Delicatessen finally called it quits late in 2002. Delicatessen recorded two sessions for John Peel's BBC Radio 1 show, both in 1995. The first was a four track studio session and the second six tracks recorded at the Reading Festival. Delicatessen at the BBC's Keeping It Peel site Lodger After the completion of Delicatessen's second album, Neil Carlill and Will Foster joined forces with Pearl Lowe, who had fronted the Britpop band Powder, and Danny Goffey of Supergrass to form one of the most noteworthy of Britpop superbands, Lodger.Owen Guthrie-Jones Review of \\"A Walk in the Park\\" The All Music Guide \\"A Walk in the Park\\" Review para 1 Signed to Island Records, Lodger released a 3 track single in 1997.

Vedette Vedette began life in Los Angeles at the end of the Chicanery recordings, during which Carlill made the acquaintance of electronic artist Manuel Stagars. The pair conceived an album of bizarre musical sketches derived from ambient recordings of Stagars, which were cut to song length with Carlill adding inspired vocal concoctions laced with surrealist touches and evocatively weird lyrics. Warren Cuccurullo also contributed his singular guitar stylings to several tracks, and Carlill played ukulele and keyboards on select songs. Vedette's self-titled debut album was released on the Stilll label (Belgium) in 2007. jayrope joined Vedette in 2008 for a series of concerts in Germany which culminated in an appearance at the Donau Musical Festival in Austria. More European shows followed in 2009 with the highlight being their talked-about performance at the Klangbad Festival in Scheer, Germany, with the pared-down line-up of Carlill and jayrope.List of performers at the 2009 Klangbad Festival Recording of the second album is in progress. 5 Little Elephants Carlill teamed up with French musician Charles-Eric Charrier for two albums recorded in 2007 and 2009. The first album is a collection of voice, percussion and noise using acoustic guitar to produce an otherworldly collection of folk abstraction. The second album is one forty-seven-minute song, featuring an epic narrative written and sung by Carlill. 5 Little Elephants' music has been referred to as unconventional hybrid pop with an intimate and beautiful mature, poetic scope.\\"Chronique\\" Liability webzine (French language) Both albums are being prepared for release.

An independent Music Magazine From Scotland 12 March 2009 Chicanery The history of Chicanery extends back to the late 1990s in London, England. During his long stint as guitarist for Duran Duran, Warren Cuccurullo conceived a side project called TV Mania with bandmate Nick Rhodes. The duo were searching for a lead vocalist to front the endeavour when, while working in the studio, they heard the voice of Neil Carlill, lead singer of the group Delicatessen, emanating from the television, on which one of that band's music videos was being broadcast. Cuccurullo found Carlill through the group's record label, and invited him to record with them at the studio.Salvo Zuppardo \\"duranasty.com interviews Chicanery\\" \\"duranasty.com\\" response to 1st question TV Mania was not commercially released at that time, but that meeting marked the beginning of a long-standing and currently active collaboration between Neil and Warren. When Cuccurullo relocated to Los Angeles after his time with Duran Duran ended in 2001, he reestablished contact with Carlill and exchanged with him demos of their latest music. With each deriving great inspiration from the other's work, and seeing the potential for a brilliant album, the two men met up in LA for the sessions that would result in Chicanery, the album. The bulk of the tracks on the debut album were cut in Los Angeles' Red Rum Studios in 2005, while some of the music was done back in Massachusetts. A portion of the material Cuccurullo had recorded with Ustad Sultan Khan back in 1998 was used on one track, Cut Me from the Mirror.Salvo Zuppardo \\"duranasty.com interviews Chicanery\\" \\"duranasty.com\\" response to 7th question Often, tracks would be recorded at respective home studios and conveyed to producer Simone Sello, before moving on to yet another, larger studio for post-recording and mixing to perfect the finished product.Andrew Greenaway \\"Interview with Chicanery Wines and Old, Old Questions\\" \\"The Idiot Bastard Son of T'Mershi Duween\\" 23 April 2010 response to 5th questionSalvo Zuppardo \\"duranasty.com interviews Chicanery\\" \\"duranasty.com\\" response to 5th question Chicanery, an energetic, diverse and somewhat genre-busting collection of avant-garde pop tunes, was released 11 May 2010.

Me Me the Moth This project is a collaboration between Carlill and musician/artist Marcelo Radulovich, who previously worked with David J and Mike Keneally, among others. Their self-produced debut album The Weirding Valley contains fourteen songs constructed via the internet, with tracks recorded by Neil in Salem, MA, and by Marcelo in Cardiff, CA. The process involved the exchanging of sound files, which were subsequently united at Radulovich's home studio.Jay Allen Sanford \\"Music by Skype\\" San Diego Reader 14 July 2010 para 3 Taking inspiration from the best of the Fluxus movement, The Weirding Valley is described as a tapestry woven of DADA-esque sensibilities.

Four videos were made by Radulovich for the songs The Red Radio, Hounds Are Sleepy, In the Air Blind and the album's title track The Weirding Valley. Airport Studies and Harvey Mapcase Carlill used the name Airport Studies for his track on the Fire Records James Joyce tribute album Chamber Music (James Joyce) in 2008. The tribute album draws upon James Joyce's collection of poems titled Chamber Music, and sets all thirty six poems to music. Carlill selected Poem XI for his contribution and explained, \\"When I was asked to contribute to the Chamber Music album for Fire Records I was immediately drawn to Poem XI. The sexual conquest of a virgin is suggested in a bygone language of an earlier era that romantically evades the real facts of the matter.

It is a subset of supply chain security and is focused on the management of cyber security requirements for information technology systems, software and networks, which are driven by threats such as cyber- terrorism, malware, data theft and the advanced persistent threat (APT). Typical supply chain cyber security activities for minimizing risks include buying only from trusted vendors, disconnecting critical machines from outside networks, and educating users on the threats and protective measures they can take. The acting deputy undersecretary for the National Protection and Programs Directorate for the United States Department of Homeland Security, Greg Schaffer, said at a hearing that he is aware that there are instances where malware has been found on imported electronic and computer devices sold within the United States.  Examples of supply chain cyber security threats  *Network or computer hardware that is delivered with malware installed on it already. *Malware that is inserted into software or hardware (by various means) * Vulnerabilities in software applications and networks within the supply chain that are discovered by malicious hackers * Counterfeit computer hardware  Related U.S. government efforts  * Comprehensive National Cyber Initiative * Defense Procurement Regulations: Noted in section 806 of the National Defense Authorization Act * International Strategy for Cyberspace: White House lays out for the first time the U.S.‚Äôs vision for a secure and open Internet. The strategy outlines three main themes: diplomacy, development and defense. :* Diplomacy: The strategy sets out to ‚Äúpromote an open, interoperable, secure and reliable information and communication infrastructure‚Äù by establishing norms of acceptable state behavior built through consensus among nations. :* Development: Through this strategy the government seeks to ‚Äúfacilitate cybersecurity capacity-building abroad, bilaterally and through multilateral organizations.‚Äù The objective is to protect the global IT infrastructure and to build closer international partnerships to sustain open and secure networks. :* Defense: The strategy calls out that the government ‚Äúwill ensure that the risks associated with attacking or exploiting our networks vastly outweigh the potential benefits‚Äù and calls for all nations to investigate, apprehend and prosecute criminals and non-state actors who intrude and disrupt network systems.  Related government efforts around the world  * Russia: Russia has had non-disclosed functionality certification requirements for several years and has recently initiated the National Software Platform effort based on open-source software. This reflects the apparent desire for national autonomy, reducing dependence on foreign suppliers. * India: Recognition of supply chain risk in its draft National Cybersecurity Strategy. Rather than targeting specific products for exclusion, it is considering Indigenous Innovation policies, giving preferences to domestic ITC suppliers in order to create a robust, globally competitive national presence in the sector. * China: Deriving from goals in the 11th Five Year Plan (2006‚Äì2010), China introduced and pursued a mix of security-focused and aggressive Indigenous Innovation policies. China is requiring an indigenous innovation product catalog be used for its government procurement and implementing a Multi-level Protection Scheme (MLPS) which requires (among other things) product developers and manufacturers to be Chinese citizens or legal persons, and product core technology and key components must have independent Chinese or indigenous intellectual property rights.

He painted portraits, still lifes and landscapes of his native Dalmatia. A member of the Group of Three, Group of Four, and the Independent Group of Artists. In addition to being an exhibiting artist, Jerolim Mi≈°e taught and encouraged other artists for over 60 years, wrote articles and critiqued visual arts. As both a painter and a critic, he made an enormous contribution to modern art in Croatia.  Biography  Jerolim Mi≈°e was born on 25 September 1890 in Split. He began to study painting at the craft school in Split, then attended the Academy of Fine Arts, Zagreb, but moved to Rome, and finally Florence where he completed his formal training at the Accademia Internazionale. The move to Rome came after an incident where he published criticism of his teacher Menci Clement Crnƒçiƒá in the paper Zvono. During his time in Italy (1891‚Äì1914), he wrote critiques and reviews of the Italian contemporary arts scene for newspapers and journals back home. He continued to write and publish stimulating articles about the visual arts scene right though his life built up a reputation as an articulate and well informed critic. On the eve of the First World War, Mi≈°e returned to Split. During the war he was conscripted, and afterwards spent a number of years (1917‚Äì1937) teaching in schools in Krapina, Slavonski Brod and Zagreb. His first solo exhibition was held in 1914 in Split, and from 1917 he participated in the exhibitions of the Spring Salon in Zagreb. During the period 1921-1927 he exhibited with the Independent Group of Artists (Grupa nezavisnih umjetnika) whose other members were Ljubo Babiƒá, Vladimir Beciƒá, Jozo Kljakoviƒá, Frano Kr≈°iniƒá, Ivan Me≈°troviƒá, Marin Studin, Zlatko ≈†ulentiƒá and Vladimir Varlaj. In 1928, he was part of the Group of Four (Grupa ƒçetvorice) with (Ljubo Babiƒá, Vladimir Beciƒá and Maksimilijan Vanka) and from 1929 the Group of Three (Grupa Trojice) which consisted of himself, Ljubo Babiƒá and Vladimir Beciƒá. He exhibited abroad in group exhibits in Paris (1919) and London (1930). In 1922 he undertook a study tour of Munich, Berlin and Dresden, where he got to know the work of the old masters, and C√©zanne. He visited Paris in 1925 and 1929, events that were crucial in forming his mature artistic style. He painted many portraits, self-portraits and still lifes. He immortalized the landscape of Braƒç, ≈†olta, Krk, Korƒçula and the Dubrovnik region. In 1937, he went to teach at the Academy of Art in Belgrade, until 1943 when he moved to the Academy of Fine Arts, Zagreb where he worked until his retirement in 1961. Jerolim Mi≈°e died on 14 September 1970 in Split.  Legacy  While studying in Rome and Florence, Mi≈°e was more interested in art theory than practice, spending time with the Rome avant-garde circle, questioning issues such as Viennese secession as opposed to Italian futurism and post-cubist trends. There, he also spent time with fellow Split native Ivan Me≈°troviƒá. However, Mi≈°e‚Äôs painting from that period do not show the influence of art nouveau secessionist linearism nor heroic mythology. His motifs are simple, the content minimalist. Mi≈°e's early work consisted mainly of portraits, but he later developed into a landscape painter, and finally began to paint everything he saw: views, landscapes, portraits, still lifes, animals. His later landscapes of his native Dalmatia capture an experience of the colour and atmosphere. Mi≈°e went to Paris for the first time in 1925, and according to the painter himself, that is when his ‚Äúreorientation‚Äù started. For his retrospective exhibition in 1955 at the Modern Gallery, Zagreb, he wrote: \\"I started with the Secession and I was already thirty-two when I came into contact with van Gogh, Renoir and C√©zanne\\". In 1928, for the first time he spent a long period in Supetar on the island of Braƒç where he painted a series of views of the town with its empty streets in the summer heat and a number of landscapes and seascapes that are expressive colourist works reminiscent of C√©zanne‚Äôs and Renoir‚Äôs painting styles. In his work can be identified contacts with contemporary German and French art styles. The art historian and curator, Igor Zidiƒá summarized the conflicting styles in Mi≈°e's work \\"...the struggle between the hard, clear volumes of secessionist art, and the vibrating surfaces of impressionism... he is wrestling between the (German) fascination with the subject and the (French) obsession with light.\\" Works * Self-portrait (Autoportret), 1916 * Portrait of a Bride (Portret zaruƒçnice) * Girl with Melon (Djevojku s dinjom) * Portrait of Ivo Tartaglia (Portret Ive Tartaglie), 1919 * Seascape, Supetar (Primorsku vedutu, Supetar) * Noon in Supetar, (Podne u Supetaru) 1928 * Portrait of the Painter Raƒçki (Portret slikara Raƒçkog), 1929 * Red House (Crvene kuƒáe), 1930 * Noon in Koloƒçep (Podne u Koloƒçepu), 1931 * Young Girl (Djevojƒçica), 1932 * Grouper (≈†karpina), 1934 * May Morning on Lopud (Majsko jutro na Lopudu) * Still life with brushes (Mrtva priroda s kistovima), 1961 Exhibitions =Solo shows= During his lifetime, Mi≈°e held solo exhibits in Split, Slavonski Brod, Rijeka, Zadar, Zagreb and Belgrade.

It was developed by Jacob Bekenstein and Mordehai Milgrom in their 1984 paper, \\"Does the missing mass problem signal the breakdown of Newtonian gravity?\\". \\"AQUAL\\" stands for \\"A QUAdratic Lagrangian\\". The gravitational force law obtained from MOND, :m mu left (frac{a}{a_0} right) a = frac{GMm}{r^2}, has a serious defect: it violates Newton's third law of motion, and therefore fails to conserve momentum and energy. To see this, consider two objects with m eq M; then we have: :mu left (frac{a_m}{a_0} right) m a_m = frac{GMm}{r^2} = frac{GMm}{r^2} = mu left (frac{a_M}{a_0} right) M a_M but the third law gives m a_m = M a_M, so we would get :mu left (frac{a_m}{a_0} right)=mu left (frac{a_M}{a_0} right) even though a_m eq a_M, and mu would therefore be constant, contrary to the MOND assumption that it is linear for small arguments. This problem can be rectified by deriving the force law from a Lagrangian, at the cost of possibly modifying the general form of the force law. Then conservation laws could then be derived from the Lagrangian by the usual means. The AQUAL Lagrangian is: :rho Phi + frac{1}{8 pi G} a_0^2 F left (frac{ ablaPhi^2}{a_0^2} right); this leads to a modified Poisson equation: : abla cdot left (mu left (frac{ ablaPhi}{a_0} right ) ablaPhi right ) = 4 pi G rho, qquad text{with } quad mu(x) = frac{dF(x^2)}{dx}. where the predicted acceleration is - ablaPhi = a. These equations reduce to the MOND equations in the spherically symmetric case, although they differ somewhat in the disc case needed for modelling spiral or lenticular galaxies. However, the difference is only 10‚Äì15%, so does not seriously impact the results. According to Sanders and McGaugh, one problem with AQUAL (or any scalar‚Äìtensor theory in which the scalar field enters as a conformal factor multiplying Einstein's metric) is AQUAL's failure to predict the amount of gravitational lensing actually observed in rich clusters of galaxies.

They serve more than 300 credit unions in California and Nevada with more than 10 million members and more than $208 billion in assets. The two Leagues joined in 1996 and became known as the California and Nevada Credit Union Leagues. The Leagues are the largest state- level credit union trade association in the United States. The Leagues are geographically divided into 20 chapters (18 in California, 2 in Nevada). Each League has its own chairman and board of directors elected by member credit unions in the respective states. Within the three-tier credit union system, the Leagues maintain a mutual partnership with the Credit Union National Association (CUNA).http://www.ccul.org/> Brief history of the California Credit Union League In 1933, less than 10 years after the founding of the first credit union in California, the California Credit Union League was organized by a group of approximately 25 credit unions at a meeting in Fresno. By 1940, League membership had grown to 246 credit unions. The San Francisco Credit Union Digest (eventually renamed as Credit Union Digest) was adopted as the official flagship publication of the League in 1941. The League shared its first headquarters with East Bay Postal Credit Union on the second floor of the Oakland Post Office. Founded in 1927, East Bay Postal Credit Union merged with and into Pacific Postal Credit Union July 1, 2012, continuing consolidation within the industry. Throughout the years, the League's headquarters moved from the Bay Area to Pomona to Rancho Cucamonga to its current location in Ontario, California. The Leagues also currently operate offices in Sacramento, California and Washington, D.C. The League has launched a number of credit union service organizations, including Western Bridge Corporate Federal Credit Union in 1977 (which was formerly known as the California Central Federal Credit Union and then as Western Corporate Federal Credit Union, and consolidated into Catalyst Corporate FCU in July 2012); CO- OP Financial Services (formerly known as CU-ATM Cooperatives, Inc.) in 1981; CU Direct Corporation in 1994 in partnership with The Golden 1 Credit Union; and CU West Mortgage, Inc. in 2003, in partnership with SchoolsFirst Federal Credit Union (formerly Orange County Teachers FCU).The Splendid Gift: The California Credit Union League in the 20th Century, Laura Porter, 2001 In 1992, the League founded the Shapiro Group to cooperatively pool the resources of the credit union community to help small credit unions operate efficiently and effectively.

Darrel R. Daines was elected as the League's first president and the first board of directors was formed. Later that year, Glen A. Reese assumed the role as the League's managing director and the Maryland Parkway League offices opened. The League's first annual meeting was held in 1970; the same year the first issue of its flagship publication, Nevada Nuggets, was published. In 1975, the League celebrated the passage of the state's credit union law. The first state- chartered credit union was Nevada Central CU. Between the years of 1976 through 1990, the League became fully self-supporting, CU Plaza became its new headquarters, a credit union division was formed within the state's Department of Commerce, membership in Nevada credit unions increased, and the Nevada CU Political Action Committee was formed.http://www.ccul.org/02media/aboutleague.cfm The leagues join forces In September 1995, the California Credit Union League board of directors approved a management services agreement with the Nevada Credit Union League which allowed the two leagues to remain separate entities, with the California League providing a range of services to Nevada credit unions. In October 1995, the 15 credit union members of the Nevada League voted unanimously to support the agreement, which went into effect January 1, 1996. At the time, then- California League President and CEO David L. Chatfield became president and CEO of both leagues, while Nevada League President and CEO Glen Reese stayed on as a consultant.http://www.ccul.org/02media/aboutleague.cfm Services The Leagues provide an array of services to its member credit unions within a framework of innovation and cooperation in the following areas: =Advocacy= This division includes Federal Government Affairs, State Government Affairs, Regulatory Advocacy, and Political Action Committee (PAC). =Member Solutions= This division includes Membership, Communications and Marketing; Education & Training; Research & Collaboration; and Credit Union Solutions.

The 300 acre estate is also the site of Ranton Abbey, one of many Augustinian abbeys founded across England from the 1140s to the 1160s. Today, only the imposing 15th-century church tower survives. The Ranton Estate was purchased c 1819 by Viscount Anson, who was created the First Earl of Lichfield in the coronation honours of King William IV in 1831. He spent large sums of money improving the estate and the house, which was used as a centre for sporting hospitality hosting great shooting parties, for distinguished guests including, Sir Francis Grant (who was to become President of the Royal Academy), Lord Melbourne, then Prime Minister, Lord Sefton and the Earl of Uxbridge.The Ranton Estate, Staffordshire, Savills of Telford & London and Knight Frank of Birmingham The house has been a mere shell since being gutted by fire in 1942 when the bodyguard of Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands were stationed there. The estate was sold to the Wedgwood porcelain company in the 1950s but bought back by Patrick Lichfield, the 5th Earl, in 1987 with a view to restoring the house or building a replacement. Realisation of these plans was delayed for many years due to objections from English Heritage. Permission was finally granted in December 2005, only a month after Lichfield died.

Bintley incorporates elements of the 14th century satire Roman de Fauvel with the character of Edward, replacing that of the ass Fauvel, Piers Gaveston as the Fool, and Queen Isabella as the Virgin. As such, the narrative depicts the self-obsessed sexual relationships of the three main characters with the increasing civil unrest in the country as a backdrop.

Thompson, 563 U.S. 51 (2011), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court considered whether a prosecutor's office can be held liable for a single Brady violation by one of its members on the theory that the office provided inadequate training.. In 1984, John Thompson, a 22-year-old African American father of two, was charged along with another man for killing a prominent New Orleans businessman. After his picture was published in the newspaper because of the arrest, victims of an unsolved attempted armed robbery identified Thompson as the person involved. Handling both cases, district attorney of the Parish of Orleans, Harry Connick Sr., chose to first bring to trial the armed robbery against Thompson in hopes that a conviction would help with the murder case. Based solely on the identification by the three victims, Thompson was found guilty of attempted armed robbery and sentenced to 50 years in prison. Then during the murder trial, Thompson was effectively precluded from testifying in his own defense because the prosecution would have impeached his testimony by referring to his armed robbery conviction. His codefendant was able to testify that he saw Thompson commit the murder without rebuttal testimony from Thompson. Thompson was convicted of the murder and sentenced to death. However, Connick suppressed a critical blood sample test. A blood splatter on the victim from the perpetrator of the robbery showed that the perpetrator had a different blood type than Thompson. This meant that Thompson was wrongfully convicted of the robbery - a conviction that prohibited him from defending himself vigorously in the murder case. His murder case was vacated in 2002 and he was retried with his defense providing evidence that another man had committed the murder. After nearly two decades of wrongfully being imprisoned, Thompson was found not guilty in the retrial. Thompson sued Connick and several of his assistant district attorneys for suppression of evidence and won a verdict of $14 million. The Supreme Court overturned the $14 million award by a lower court in a 5‚Äì4 decision split along ideological lines.\\"Supreme Court rules against exonerated death row inmate who sued prosecutors\\" By Robert Barnes, Tuesday, March 29, 10:51 PM The Washington Post The minority dissent observes that, as a matter of fact, Thompson was the victim of much more pervasive misconduct by the District Attorney's office than a single Brady violation. The Supreme Court found for the appellant, Harry Connick, Sr., and ruled that the prosecutor's office is not liable. Opinion of the Court Justice Thomas wrote for the Court: \\"Petitioner the Orleans Parish District Attorney‚Äôs Office concedes that, in prosecuting respondent Thompson for attempted armed robbery, prosecutors violated Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83, by failing to disclose a crime lab report. Because of his robbery conviction, Thompson elected not to testify at his later murder trial and was convicted. A month before his scheduled execution, the lab report was discovered. A reviewing court vacated both convictions, and Thompson was found not guilty in a retrial on the murder charge. He then filed suit against the district attorney‚Äôs office under 42 U. S. C. ¬ß1983, alleging, inter alia, that the Brady violation was caused by the office‚Äôs deliberate indifference to an obvious need to train prosecutors to avoid such constitutional violations. The district court held that, to prove deliberate indifference, Thompson did not need to show a pattern of similar Brady violations when he could demonstrate that the need for training was obvious. The jury found the district attorney‚Äôs office liable for failure to train and awarded Thompson damages. The Fifth Circuit affirmed by an equally divided court. Held: A district attorney‚Äôs office may not be held liable under ¬ß1983 for failure to train its prosecutors based on a single Brady violation.\\" \\"(a) Plaintiffs seeking to impose ¬ß1983 liability on local governments must prove that their injury was caused by ‚Äúaction pursuant to official municipal policy,‚Äù which includes the decisions of a government's lawmakers, the acts of its policy making officials, and practices so persistent and widespread as to practically have the force of law. Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Servs., 436 U. S. 658, 691. A local government's decision not to train certain employees about their legal duty to avoid violating citizens‚Äô rights may rise to the level of an official government policy for ¬ß1983 purposes, but the failure to train must amount to ‚Äúdeliberate indifference to the rights of persons with whom the [untrained employees] come into contact.‚Äù Canton v. Harris, 489 U. S. 378, 388. Deliberate indifference in this context requires proof that city policymakers disregarded the ‚Äúknown or obvious consequence‚Äù that a particular omission in their training program would cause city employees to violate citizens‚Äô constitutional rights. Board of Comm‚Äôrs of Bryan Cty. v. Brown, 520 U. S. 397, 410.\\" \\"(b) A pattern of similar constitutional violations by untrained employees is ‚Äúordinarily necessary‚Äù to demonstrate deliberate indifference. Bryan Cty., supra, at 409. Without notice that a course of training is deficient, decision makers can hardly be said to have deliberately chosen a training program that will cause violations of constitutional rights. Thompson does not contend that he proved a pattern of similar Brady violations, and four reversals by Louisiana courts for dissimilar Brady violations in the 10 years before the robbery trial could not have put the district attorney's office on notice of the need for specific training.\\" \\"(c) Thompson mistakenly relies on the ‚Äúsingle-incident‚Äù liability hypothesized in Canton, contending that the Brady violation in his case was the ‚Äúobvious‚Äù consequence of failing to provide specific Brady training and that this ‚Äúobviousness‚Äù showing can substitute for the pattern of violations ordinarily necessary to establish municipal culpability. In Canton, the Court theorized that if a city armed its police force and deployed them into the public to capture fleeing felons without training the officers in the constitutional limitation on the use of deadly force, the failure to train could reflect the city's deliberate indifference to the highly predictable consequence, namely, violations of constitutional rights. Failure to train prosecutors in their Brady obligations does not fall within the narrow range of Canton's hypothesized single-incident liability. The obvious need for specific legal training present in Canton's scenario‚Äîpolice academy applicants are unlikely to be familiar with constitutional constraints on deadly force and, absent training, cannot obtain that knowledge‚Äîis absent here. Attorneys are trained in the law and equipped with the tools to interpret and apply legal principles, understand constitutional limits, and exercise legal judgment. They receive training before entering the profession, must usually satisfy continuing education requirements, often train on the job with more experienced attorneys, and must satisfy licensing standards and ongoing ethical obligations. Prosecutors not only are equipped but are ethically bound to know what Brady entails and to perform legal research when they are uncertain. Thus, recurring constitutional violations are not the ‚Äúobvious consequence‚Äù of failing to provide prosecutors with formal in-house training. The nuance of the allegedly necessary training also distinguishes the case from the example in Canton. Here, the prosecutors were familiar with the general Brady rule. Thus, Thompson cannot rely on the lack of an ability to cope with constitutional situations that underlies the Canton hypothetical, but must assert that prosecutors were not trained about particular Brady evidence or the specific scenario related to the violation in his case. That sort of nuance simply cannot support an inference of deliberate indifference here.

New Mexico, 564 U.S. 647 (2011), is a significant 6th Amendment Confrontation Clause case decided by the United States Supreme Court. On June 23, 2011, the Supreme Court considered the issue whether a defendant's Confrontation Clause rights extend to a non-testifying laboratory analyst whose supervisor testifies as to test results that the analyst transcribed from a machine. In a five to four decision authored by Justice Ginsburg, the Court held that the second surrogate analyst could not testify about the testimonial statements in the forensic report of the certifying analyst under the Confrontation Clause.. The case follows a line of decisions, including Crawford v. Washington (2004) and Davis v. Washington (2006), that altered the Court's interpretation of the Confrontation Clause guarantee and clarified its application only to \\"testimonial\\" statements. Background Donald Bullcoming of New Mexico was arrested on suspicion of driving while intoxicated. He was sentenced to two years in prison for a felony aggravated DWI/DUI. At the trial, the State used a blood alcohol test that was taken under a search warrant after Bullcoming refused to take a breathalyzer test. At his trial, the prosecution presented a lab report indicating that his blood-alcohol levels were elevated. But rather than calling the technician who had prepared and signed the report, prosecutors called a colleague who had not observed or reviewed the analysis. Issue Whether the Confrontation Clause permits the prosecution to introduce testimonial statements of a nontestifying forensic analyst through the in-court testimony of a supervisor or other person who did not perform or observe the laboratory analysis described in the statements. Procedural History On February 12, 2010, the New Mexico Supreme Court issued its written decision, cited at 147 N.M. 487, 226 P.3d 1. On March 2, 2011, the oral argument before the United States Supreme Court took place, during which Jeffrey L. Fisher argued on behalf of the Petitioner and Gary King argued on behalf of the Respondent. The United States Supreme Court issued its written decision on June 23, 2011. Decision of the Supreme Court In a 5 to 4 decision in favor of Bullcoming, Justice Ginsburg wrote the majority opinion for the Court. The US Supreme Court ruled that the Sixth Amendment gives a criminal defendant the right ‚Äúto be confronted with the witnesses against him,‚Äù and that ‚Äúsurrogate testimony‚Äù is not good enough.https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/24/us/24scotus.html?_r=0 See also *Melendez-Diaz v.

He most recently played for the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League (CFL). He is a four-time East Division All-Star and has also played for the Montreal Alouettes and Hamilton Tiger-Cats. Bomben played CIS football for the Guelph Gryphons. Professional career He was originally drafted 31st overall by the Montreal Alouettes in the 2010 CFL Draft. In 2011 and 2012 with the Alouettes, he dressed in all 36 games as a back-up offensive lineman. He scored his first professional touchdown on October 28, 2012 on a five-yard reception and record five receptions for 33 yards in 2012 as a tight end. In 2013, he became a regular starter at offensive guard, starting 15 regular season games while dressing in all 18. He started all 18 regular season games in 2014 as well as starting both playoff games that year. Bomben was obtained by the Hamilton Tiger-Cats prior to the start of the 2015 CFL Draft, in exchange for their first-round pick (eighth overall, used to select Jacob Ruby, OL, Richmond) and third-round pick (24th overall, used to select James Bodanis, OL, Michigan State). He played in 12 games for the Tiger-Cats in 2015, starting in 11 at right guard, before suffering a season-ending injury on October 23, 2015 against the BC Lions. He had signed a three-year contract extension with Hamilton on October 15, 2015. He was named an East Division All-Star that year which was the first of his career. He continued his strong play in 2016, starting all 18 regular season games at right guard while being named the Tiger-Cats' Most Outstanding Offensive Lineman and another East Division All-Star award. In 2017, he once again started all 18 regular season games and was named an East Division All- Star. On May 2, 2018, he was traded along with Hamilton‚Äôs second overall selection in the 2018 CFL Draft, wide receiver Jamal Robinson, a fourth round pick (34th overall) in 2018, a seventh round pick (56th overall) in 2018, and rights to an undisclosed negotiation list player, for Montreal's first overall pick in 2018, a fourth round pick (31st overall) in 2018, a sixth round pick (44th overall) in 2018, and a second round pick (would become 10th overall) in 2019. He played and started in six games for the Alouettes in his return to Montreal. However, the reunion was short-lived as the Alouettes traded Bomben and a 2020 fifth-round pick to the Toronto Argonauts in exchange for T.J. Heath and a 2020 third-round pick on July 29, 2018. He dressed in 12 games for the Argonauts, starting 11, and was once again named an East Division All-Star for his combined play with the Alouettes and Argonauts.

It is commonly desired and implemented, but for many years, the various ways in which it could be implemented with available technologies all had drawbacks..appendTo: Solving the Holy Grail Layout Because of this, finding an optimal implementation was likened to searching for the elusive Holy Grail. The limitations of CSS and HTML, the desirability of semantically meaningful pages that rank well in search engines, and the deficiencies of various browsers combined historically to create a situation in which there was no way to create this type of layout that would be considered totally correct. As the underlying technologies did not provide a proper solution, web designers found various ways to work around the limitations. Common workarounds included changes in page structure, the addition of graphics, scripting, and the creative use of CSS. These methods were imperfect, inconvenient, and considered by some to be abuse of the web standards and their intent. More recent web standards have provided much more complete and robust solutions for implementing this layout. In particular, the CSS Flexible Box Layout and CSS Grid Layout modules have both provided full solutions.  The problem  Many web pages require a layout with multiple (often three) columns, with the main page content in one column (often the center), and supplementary content such as menus and advertisements in the other columns (sidebars). These columns commonly require separate backgrounds, with borders between them, and should appear to be the same height no matter which column has the tallest content. A common requirement is that the sidebars have a fixed width, with the center column adjusting in size to fill the window (fluid or liquid layout). Another common requirement is that, when a page does not contain enough content to fill the screen, the footer should drop to the bottom of the browser window instead of leaving blank space underneath. CSS Layout with floated columns and cleared footer, without holy grail featuresThere were many obstacles to accomplishing this: * CSS, although quite useful for styling, had limited capabilities for page layout. * The height of block elements (such as div elements) is normally determined by their content. So two divisions, side by side, with different amounts of content, will have different heights unless their height is somehow set to an appropriate value. * HTML is meant to be used semantically; HTML elements should be chosen which accurately describe their content. The appearance of a web page as rendered by a user agent should be determined independently by style rules. Many implementations misuse HTML by using tables for non-tabular data, or nesting multiple div elements without semantic purpose. Non-semantic use of HTML confuses users or user agents who are trying to discern the structure of the page content, and is an accessibility issue.W3C: HTML5/Elements/Semantics * As search engines may consider content in the beginning of a web page's source code to be more relevant, and content is read in source code order when viewed by some user agents such as screen readers, web designers desire the ability to place the content in the page source in an arbitrary order, without affecting the appearance of the page. * Because of incorrect rendering of content by different browsers, a method that works in a standards-compliant browser may not work in one that does not implement CSS correctly.  Known workarounds  = Tables = Before the widespread implementation of CSS, designers commonly used tables to lay out pages. Sometimes they achieved their desired layout by nesting several tables inside each other. Although placing the columns inside table cells easily achieves the desired visual appearance, using a table is semantically incorrect, although the \\"role\\" WAI-ARIA HTML attribute can be set to \\"presentation\\" to regain semantic context. There is also no way to control the order of the columns in the page source. = Divisions with display:table = It is possible to make columns equal height using the CSS \`display\` property.Build Internet: Four Methods to Create Equal Height Columns This requires nested container divisions that are set to \`display: table\` and \`display: table-row\`, and columns that are set to \`display: table-cell\`. This is semantically correct, as only the display is affected. However, this method lacks the ability to control the order of the source code. It will also not work with some older, unsupported browsers, such as Internet Explorer 7. = Faux columns = This method uses a background image which provides the background colors and vertical borders of all three columns.A List Apart: Faux Columns The content of each column is enclosed in a division, and positioned over its background using techniques such as floats, negative margins, and relative positioning. The background is normally only a few pixels high, and is made to cover the page using the \\"repeat-y\\" attribute. This works fine for fixed-width layouts, and can be adapted for percentage-based variable-width pages, but cannot be used for fluid center pages. = JavaScript = In this method, after the page is loaded, a script measures the height of each of the columns, and sets the height of each column to the greater value. This will not work in browsers that do not support JavaScript, or have JavaScript disabled. = Fixed or absolute positioning = In this method, the corners of the column divisions are locked in a specific place on the page.W3C: Tableless Layout HOWTO This may be acceptable or even desired, but does not solve the holy grail problem as it is a significantly different layout. The consequences of this method may include having content appearing below the columns (such as a footer) fixed at the screen bottom, blank space under the column content, and requiring scrollbars for each column to view all the content. = Nested divisions = A division with its background will grow in height to contain its content. This behavior is used to solve the problem by creating three divisions nested inside each other which provide the three backgrounds. These divisions are placed in their proper location using positioning techniques, and the three content divisions are placed inside the innermost background division, positioned over their respective backgrounds. The background divisions then become as tall as the tallest content division. The drawbacks of this method include the three non-semantic divisions, and the difficulty of positioning the elements of this complex layout.Matthew James Taylor: Equal Height Columns with Cross-Browser CSS = Border color = A simpler version of the nested division method entails using a single container division. The background properties of this division provides the background of the center column, and the left and right borders, which are given widths equal to the side column widths, provide the background colors of the sidebars. The content of each column is positioned over its background. This method still uses one non-semantic division, and makes it difficult to apply background images and borders to the sidebars.A List Apart: Articles: Multi-Column Layouts Climb Out of the Box = Bottom padding = By placing a large amount of padding at the bottom of the column container, the background will extend far below the column content. A corresponding negative margin will bring content below the columns back into its proper position. Positioning is simple in this method, as the container of a column's content also contains its background. A padding value of 32767px is the largest that will be recognized by all modern browsers. If the difference in column heights is greater than this, the background of the shorter column will not fully fill the column.Position is Everything: Equal Height Columns - revisited - In search of the One True Layout  Current solutions  The CSS3 standards contain modules which are intended for layout of page elements. Two of these fully solve the holy grail problem..appendTo: Solving the Holy Grail LayoutHoly Grail Layout -- Solved By Flexbox -- Cleaner, hack-free CSS Support for these modules is lacking or otherwise deficient in older browsers. Many designers will implement these modules while providing compatible styling for older browsers, which will be overridden in modern browsers by the new syntax. Support for older browsers became less important in 2020, when extended support for Windows 7 ended, and use of Internet Explorer became less common. = CSS Flexible Box Layout (Flexbox)= The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has approached the layout issue through various proposals. The most mature proposal is the Flexible Box Layout Module (A.K.A. Flexbox), which is in Candidate Recommendation status as of November 2018.W3C: CSS Flexible Box Layout Module Setting an element's display property to \`display: flex\` or \`display: inline-flex\` causes the element to become a new type of container (similar to a block or inline block, respectively), with new methods of positioning child objects. Content can flow in any direction, and be displayed in any order. The W3C proposal contains an example which achieves the holy grail column layout using four simple CSS rules, and makes the layout responsive with a simple media query rule. The module can also be used to address many other layout issues. The Flexible Box Layout Module is supported in all of the modern browsers, although Internet Explorer's implementation has issues. = CSS Grid Layout = The Grid Layout Module similarly allows a designer to create a container for layout, which contains rows and columns of fixed or variable size into which elements can be placed. It is in Candidate Recommendation status as of August 2020.W3C: CSS Grid Layout It is supported in all modern browsers, however Internet Explorer's implementation has issues.Can I use: CSS Grid Layout This module is a continuation of previous work done as the Grid Positioning Module, Template Layout Module, and Advanced Layout Module.W3C: CSS Template Layout Module One aspect of this module is the ability to create grid slots in a container semi- graphically, in a manner that has been described as \\"ASCII art\\", as in the superseded Template Layout module. Although the Flexible Box module is capable of performing 2-dimensional page layout, its intended purpose is to position elements primarily along a single axis. Grid Layout is preferred for laying out complex pages, and pages whose layout varies greatly in a responsive design.Why Flexboxes Aren't Good for Page Layout  History  The first three-column flanking design that used pure CSS was developed by Rob Chandanais of BlueRobotBlueRobot: Three Column Flanking Layout for the site wrongwaygoback.com in 2001. At that point Neale Talbot was using JavaScript to determine the positioning of the right-hand column. Chandanais came up with an elegant solution for the positioning using pure CSS instead and soon after dubbed The Holy Grail by Eric Costello of Glish.com.

California Historic Landmarks, Riverside, NO. 749 SAAHATPA, www.parks.ca.gov accessed, 2/1/2011 History Juan Antonio's Mountain Cahuilla were settled in Politana in 1845, to protect the herds of horses and cattle of the Rancho San Bernardino from the raids of bandits and the native tribes from the nearby mountains, the Mojave Desert and Utah. They remained there until 1851 when the Rancho was attacked by the Irving Gang, a band of Americans, claiming to avenge the killing of three Americans in the Cajon Pass, by two men of the Lugo family. As they had done many times before against other bandits, under the authority of the local justice of the peace, Juan Antonio and his men chased all but one of the gang into San Timoteo Canyon, cornered them in a box canyon, surrounded and killed them with arrows. Word of the incident was mistakenly seen by many of the local Americans as an Indian uprising against them. A militia force from San Diego County was sent to quell this supposed uprising, led by Joshua Bean. Judge Hayes held a hearing and subsequently found their actions had legal justification. However the resentment of local Americans at the killing of fellow Americans led Juan Antonio to move his people away from white settlements in the valley to Saahatpa. There Juan Antonio and his people remained until the winter of 1862‚Äì1863, when a smallpox epidemic swept through Southern California killing many, especially the Native American population who had little immunity to the disease. The victims included Juan Antonio and many of his Cahuilla people, reducing their numbers so they were reduced from a majority to a minority in their own land.According to California registered landmark #749, Cahuilla tradition asserts that the U.S. government sent army blankets that were contaminated with smallpox. After this disaster, Juan Antonio was buried there and Saahatpa was abandoned. In 1956 an archeological expedition discovered Juan Antonio's body at Saahatpa, identified by his epaulets. He was reburied with military honors.Carole A. Barrett and Harvey Markowitz, Editors, American Indian Biographies, Revised Edition, Salem Press, Pasadena, 2005, , p. 13, Marker Marker on the site reads: *NO. 749 SAAHATPA - Chief Juan Antonio and his band of Cahuilla Indians helped white settlers in the San Bernardino area defend their property and livestock against outlaws during the 1840s and 1850s. In late 1851, Juan Antonio, his warriors and their families, settled at nearby Saahatpa. During the winter of 1862-63, a smallpox epidemic swept through Southern California killing many Native Americans, including Juan Antonio. Cahuilla tradition asserts that the U.S. Government sent Army blankets that were contaminated with smallpox. After this disaster, Saahatpa was abandoned.californiahistoricallandmarks.com 749 The marker has been inaccessible since about 2005. The Brookside Rest Area, where the marker is located, was closed because the well that had provided a water source ran dry and the water table became inadequate due to a long-running drought. Budget problems several years later contributed to the problem of finding a new water source; in addition, the area has become urbanized since the rest area was built, making its necessity questionable.https://www.pe.com/2015/07/26/on-the- road-why-have-i-10-rest-stops-been-closed-so-long/  See also *California Historical Landmarks in Riverside County, California References California Historical Landmarks Former settlements in Riverside County, California 1851 establishments in California ","title":"Saahatpa, California"},{"id":"31267706","text":"England Head Coach: Clive Woodward # Garath Archer # Neil Back # Iain Balshaw # Mike Catt # Ben Cohen # Martin Corry # Lawrence Dallaglio # Matt Dawson (c.) # Darren Garforth # Andy Gomarsall # Phil Greening # Austin Healey # Richard Hill # Alex King # Jason Leonard # Neil McCarthy # Matt Perry # Simon Shaw # Mike Tindall # Phil Vickery # Jonny Wilkinson # Trevor Woodman # Joe Worsley France Head Coach: Bernard Laporte # Franck Belot # Abdelatif Benazzi # Philippe Bernat-Salles # Serge Betsen # David Bory # Olivier Brouzet # Christian Califano # Thomas Castaign√®de # S√©bastien Chabal # Arnaud Costes # Marc Dal Maso # Jean Daude # Pieter de Villiers # C√©dric Desbrosse # Christophe Dominici # Richard Dourthe # Jean-Baptiste √âlissalde # Fabien Galthie # St√©phane Glas # C√©dric Heymans # Aubin Hueber # Rapha√´l Iba√±ez # Christophe Lamaison # Christophe Laussucq # Thomas Li√®vremont # Thomas Lombard # Olivier Magne # Lionel Mallier # Legi Matiu # Gerald Merceron # Hugues Miorin # √âmile Ntamack # Fabien Pelous (c.) # Alain Penaud # Franck Tournaire # David Venditti Ireland Head Coach: Warren Gatland # Justin Bishop # Trevor Brennan # Bob Casey # Peter Clohessy # Jeremy Davidson # Kieron Dawson # Girvan Dempsey # Guy Easterby # Simon Easterby # Eric Elwood # Justin Fitzpatrick # Anthony Foley # Mick Galwey # John Hayes # Rob Henderson # Denis Hickie # Shane Horgan # David Humphreys # Paddy Johns # Kevin Maggs # Michael Mullins # Dion O'Cuinneagain # Brian O'Driscoll # Ronan O'Gara # Malcolm O'Kelly # Conor O'Shea # Frankie Sheahan # Peter Stringer # Tom Tierney # Paul Wallace # Andy Ward # Keith Wood (c.)

It is endemic to Colorado in the United States, where it is known only from a small strip of unique mountain habitat measuring 40 kilometers long.Eutrema penlandii. The Nature Conservancy. It is threatened by mining and associated environmental changes in this part of the Continental Divide in central Colorado. The plant was federally listed as a threatened species of the US in 1993.USFWS. The plant Eutrema penlandii (Penland alpine fen mustard) determined to be a threatened species. Federal Register July 28, 1993.  Distribution  This plant is the only Eutrema in the lower 48 states and only one of two that occur in North America; its nearest close relative is Eutrema edwardii, a plant of the Arctic. E. penlandii is a small alpine climate species, possibly a relict from the last ice age which persists in the high, cold fens of the Rocky Mountains. Today the plant only occurs in the Mosquito Range, a ridge of mountains in the Rockies.Mohlenbrock, R. H. This land: a guide to central national forests. University of California Press. 2006. page 47. It was first collected by the botanist C. William Penland in 1935 on Hoosier Ridge in the Mosquito Range, and it is one of several rare alpine plants native to the area, such as the globe gilia (Gilia globularis).  Description  This plant is a perennial herb growing about six inches tall and bearing clusters of cream-white flowers in the summer. The alpine habitat of the plant is a wet tundra kept constantly fed with ample water by the surrounding snowfields. Wind melts the snow which runs into the tundra and turns it to a fen, a wetland on limestone substrates. The plant grows in rocky nooks that shelter it from the wind and keep the mossy peat soil saturated, but not flooded. The elevation is at least 3700 meters. The habitat is within a section of the Continental Divide that trends east-west in opposition to the general north-south direction of most of the ranges, and the plants grow on south- and east-facing slopes. There are about eleven occurrences, with populations at Hoosier Ridge, Mount Silverheels, the Mosquito Pass, the Hilltop Mine, Mount Evans, and Loveland Mountain. The total area occupied by the plant is probably around .  Status  = Threats = Mining is a common industry in the high mountain peaks occupied by the plant, and mining companies and stakeholders did not agree with federal protection plans for the species and its habitat. Active claims for gold and trace metals are still in place, though mining activity is currently low because of the status of the market. Activities associated with mining, such as ditching, diking, and trail maintenance, alter the hydrology of the landscape, and this is a major threat to the habitat that the plant depends on. There is a specific water balance maintained by the snowmelt from the high ridges which keeps the soil quite wet but not flooded, and changing the path of flowing water could disrupt it. The plant almost always grows within half a meter of actively flowing meltwater. Mining activity could also lower the pH of the normally alkaline soils. Other threats include recreational activity including hiking, mountain biking, and the use of off-road vehicles, horses, and burros.

Gainey, Sami Gayle, Mark Valley and Josh Lucas. It was released in the United States on September 14, 2012. Plot In New Orleans, Will Montgomery (Nicolas Cage) and Vincent Kinsey (Josh Lucas) are preparing for a heist, aided by Riley (Malin √Ökerman), their getaway driver, and Hoyt (M.C. Gainey), a computer security expert. They are watched by FBI agent Tim Harland (Danny Huston), who knows that Will and Vincent have been casing a jewelry store for several weeks and plans to arrest them mid-crime. Will and Vincent break into the neighboring toy store, blowing the adjacent wall. Harland gives them a few minutes before sending his agents into the jewelry store, but Will and Vincent are not there, having instead used the jewelry store to gain access to a bank. In the vault, Will collects $10 million in wrapped bills and drags away Vincent, who had been eyeing a stack of gold bars. They come across a janitor in a back alley. Vincent attempts to kill the man, but Will stops him, and Vincent accidentally shoots himself in the leg. As their escape van pulls up, Vincent gets in and tells the others to drive off, leaving Will stranded with the money and the FBI closing fast. After a car chase, Will is cornered in an abandoned building. Agents arrest him but find no evidence of the money. Eight years later, Will is released from prison. He is taken back to New Orleans by Harland, believing that Will stashed the money before his arrest. He warns that he will be watching Will closely. Will returns to his daughter Alison (Sami Gayle), finding that she is struggling with abandonment issues. She refuses to let him talk to her, instead handing over a package addressed to him that was left there that morning. She goes off in a taxi, which is shown to have been trailing Will since his release. Will goes to a nearby bar where Riley is working. As they talk, the package starts to ring. Will finds a cell phone inside, and the caller reveals himself as Vincent, the driver of the taxi, who has now kidnapped Alison, and he demands the $10 million from the heist within 12 hours. Vincent says he will be tracking Will via the phone and will make regular calls that Will must answer or Alison will die. Vincent drugs Alison and locks her in the taxi's trunk (killing a motorcycle cop in the process). Will, aware that Harland's men are also following him, uses the Fat Tuesday celebration to escape. He purchases a second cell phone to redirect calls from the first, then plants the first phone on a leaving train to throw Vincent's tracking off. Will explains the situation to Harland, vowing that he burnt the $10 million just before he was arrested, and asks for help. Harland rejects this, showing that Vincent was reported dead a year prior, a burnt body identified by DNA. Will is forced to steal FBI credentials to find the current address of Hoyt, who is revealed to be working with Vincent and helping to track the phone. They have a brief standoff (in which Hoyt reveals Vincent lost his leg, which effected his sense of touch due to the gunshot he received) before the FBI agents arrive and kill Hoyt before he can fire on them. Will escapes, then talks to the taxi dispatcher, where they help identify Vincent's taxi and current location. In a celebration parade, Will finds that the taxi belongs to another driver, and that Vincent has masked the taxi number and stashed his cab's GPS system in the car. Will is captured again by Harland's men, but when they do not let him answer Vincent's call, Will escapes after crashing the vehicle. On the call, Will tries to explain the money is gone, but Vincent doesn't believe it at first, then states Will must come up with a way to replace Vincent's lost share, reminding him of the deadline. Will gets an idea. With Riley's help, they tunnel up below the bank where the gold was stashed and use a thermal lance to melt enough of the gold before their actions are detected. Riley drives off to distract Harland. Will takes the gold to Vincent at an abandoned amusement park, but Vincent lights the taxi on fire with Alison still inside. Will and Vincent fight, and Will takes a gunshot. He still manages to douse Vincent in gasoline and set him ablaze, giving him time to drive the taxi, first straight into Vincent, then into a nearby pond. As he races to free Alison from the submerging vehicle, Will is attacked by a now disfigured Vincent, (who due to his nerve damage doesn't feel his injuries) but impales him on a crowbar. Will rescues Alison, while locking a dying Vincent into said trunk of his sinking taxi, before collapsing on dry land just as Harland arrives in a helicopter. Harland assures Alison that Will will be okay, convinced now of Vincent's guilt, and Will is taken to get medical attention. Sometime later, Will, Riley, and Alison are enjoying an afternoon barbecue, still being watched by Harland from a distance because some of the bank gold is still missing. Will finds a chunk of the melted gold in Riley's truck‚Äîthe missing amount‚Äîand he and Riley debate whether to keep it or throw it away, the latter clearing Will of any wrongdoing. After a thought, Will throws the gold into a bayou, leaving Harland without any evidence, so he ends his monitoring. Unknown to Harland, Will threw away a decoy, and leaves the nugget on the table as the three go to enjoy lunch.

Thompson, was marked by increasing relaxation into less stringent manifestations of doctrine and practice amongst all branches of Presbyterianism.Thompson, Robert Ellis. A History of the Presbyterian Churches in the United States. New York: The Christian Literature Co., 1895. His career crossed paths with many prominent ministers and he was involved in numerous ecclesiastical courts at pivotal moments in the history of the Reformed Presbyterian Church. Amongst Reformed Presbyterians, he was an \\"Old Light,\\" and amongst \\"Old Lights,\\" he would lay claim to be an \\"Original Covenanter.\\" He was descended from a long line of Scotch-Irish. The Lusks were people of Scottish descent who, due to both civil and religious persecution, fled Scotland to the northern counties of Ireland.Stiles, Henry R.

Vol. 2 New York: Grafton Press, 1904. They were Ulster Protestants of the Presbyterian persuasion, a persuasion characterized by fastidious religious observance mixed with an aversion to authoritative persecution. Many of these Lusks settled in America prior to the American Revolutionary War. Early life and education Robert Lusk was born near the city of Derry, Ireland, to William Lusk and Elizabeth Holliday, on March 8, 1781. He was the youngest of five children. He emigrated to America, in 1792, with his parents, shortly before the Irish Rebellion of 1798. They settled in Cumberland County, Pennsylvania. In 1804, he began to attend the Academy of Greensburgh, Pennsylvania, which prepared him for his course of study. After this, he entered Jefferson College, located in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania. The choice seemed quite natural for someone reared in a dissenting Presbyterian tradition. The College boasted an impressive number of graduates occupying ministerial connections in dissenting bodies, including Reformed Presbyterians, James R. Willson and James Milligan.Smith, Joseph.

He had earned the degree of A.B. Advanced theological training and licensure to the ministry =Attending the Theological Seminary of the Reformed Presbyterian Church= By all accounts, he was endowed with superior intellect and displayed a thirst for knowledge. He was noted for his proficiency in both sciences and medicine. But it was in his theological studies that he displayed his endowments most signally. He studied theology in the Philadelphia Seminary (a Reformed Presbyterian school long since defunct) under the tutelage of Samuel B. Wylie. The Constitution of the Theological Seminary had restricted entrants to those \\"who had previously graduated some college or university,\\" with allowances for rare exceptions.Extracts from the Minutes of the Proceedings of the Judicatories of the Reformed Presbyterian Church in the United States. New York: Abraham Paul, 1816. Lusk needed no exception; his course of study commenced immediately following his graduation from Jefferson College. Prof. Samuel B. Wylie reports to Synod, in 1812, that Lusk had already attended his studies for two years. Furthermore, he had completed the \\"proper literature of the institution, and was prepared to enter the third class; agreeably to the constitution of the seminary.\\" The said Constitution had provided that the first class would consist in Biblical Literature, in order to qualify the student to understand \\"the sacred text.\\" The second class would consist in Pulpit Eloquence, in order to qualify the student to expound \\"in a persuasive manner the oracles of God.\\" The third class would consist in Systematic and Polemic Theology. This was designed to establish the student in the \\"analogy of faith\\" pursuant to the Testimony of the Reformed Presbyterian Church and a studious eye to the Confessions of the Reformed Churches. It was a course of study designed to encompass four years. The first \\"class\\" occupied the first year; the second \\"class\\" occupied the second year; the third \\"class\\" occupied the third and fourth years.Copeland, Robert M. Spare No Exertions: 175 Years of the Reformed Presbyterian Theological Seminary. Pittsburgh: Published by the Seminary, 1986. =Ministerial trials and licensing to preach= In 1814, Lusk, along with three other classmates, Jonathan Gill, Samuel Robinson and Robert Wallace, was requested by Synod to deliver a discourse, \\"in relation to systematic and polemical theology.\\" Additionally, each received a theological examination with respect to \\"the analogy of faith, pursuing the plan laid down in the testimony of the Church.\\" Prior to rendering its final verdict, the four were removed from the chamber, in order that observations might be freely made and judgments formed. When doubts were raised concerning Wallace, Wylie stated that \\"Wallace must be a proficient in Greek, as he had studied under the great Young.\\" Additionally, it was stated, \\"That Lusk had more science than all in the class; but he was too proud‚Äîhe must be humbled.\\" The Synod's examining board was satisfied with the results and declared that Lusk had honourably passed. Whereby, he was duly and fully certified by the Synod. At which point, Synod referred him to the Middle Presbytery for trial, \\"with a view to licensure, and if found duly qualified,\\" to be licensed to preach the gospel as a minister of the Reformed Presbyterian Church. This was on May 7. Two days later, he was licensed by the Middle Presbytery, on May 9, 1814.Steele, David. \\"Memoir of the Rev. Robert Lusk.\\" Contending Witness 3.5 (March 1846) ed. David Steele. Xenia, Ohio: J.H. Purdy. On May 12, Middle Presbytery reported their action licensing Lusk to preach and delivered him back up to Synod for disposal. Synod instructed Lusk to move expeditiously to the Northern Presbytery. In 1815, while still a licentiate, Lusk first visited the societies associated with the Elk (named for the Elk River), later re- christened Hephzibah, Reformed Presbyterian congregation, near Fayetteville, Tennessee, because they were without the benefit of a regular ministry. On September 26, 1815, the Board of Trustees of Jefferson College met, at that meeting Dr. McMillan and his colleagues conferred several A.M. degrees. Among the honored was \\"Robert Lusk, of Cumberland county.\\" Lusk's post-graduate studies were recognized by his alma mater. Ordination and first ministerial charge in the Reformed Presbyterian Church He was ordained to the office of the ministry and installed pastor of the Conococheague congregation, Chambersburgh, Franklin County, Pennsylvania, on August 12, 1816. Conococheague had been a hive of Covenanter activity predating the erecting of the Reformed Presbytery, in 1798. That same year, he was married to Miss Margaret Thompson, of Conococheague, Pennsylvania, with whom he had two daughters, Hannah Anne (1819‚Äì1869) and Mary Jane (ca. 1820‚Äì1901). Margaret was the daughter of John Thomson, who, along with John Renfrew, John Steele and John Scouller, was one of the four ruling elders of the congregation at this time. Shortly after Lusk's installation, a log meeting house was erected in Greenwood, Pennsylvania. =Moderator of Synod, 1817= Evidently, his esteem amongst his ministerial colleagues increased. He served as Moderator of the Synod, which met in Coldenham, New York, in 1817. Although it was common for moderators, at that time, to sit for portraits, Lusk is not represented in the commonality; there are no known images of this moderator, except those conjured up by words. At this meeting of Synod, Lusk was part of a committee, which also included Alexander McLeod and fellow Jefferson College alumnus James Milligan. In 1807, the Reformed Presbytery had proposed a plan to \\"exhibit their principles to the world,\\" which, they explained, would embrace three parts. The first part was to be Historical and exhibit the Church in her visible society in covenant with God, at various points in history, particularly that situation which holds forth the Reformed Presbyterian Church as a distinct part of the Catholic Church. The second part was Declaratory, exhibiting \\"the truths which they embrace as a Church, and the errors which they reject.\\" The third part was to be Argumentative and was to consist in full and critical investigations of the \\"various ecclesiastical systems which are known in the United States.\\"Reformation Principles Exhibited, by the Reformed Presbyterian Church in the United States of America. New York: Hopkins and Seymour, 1807. The committee was appointed to inquire into the \\"propriety of redeeming\\" the decade old pledge of Synod to complete the argumentative defence \\"for truth and against errors and immoral practices.\\" This was to form the third part of the testimony of the Church. The committee sat, deliberated, and bore fruit. In 1818, Synod began making assignments for drafting articles for this part of the Testimony. Although he was absent from Synod that year,Extracts from the Minutes of the Synod of the Reformed Presbyterian Church, Session VII-1818. Lusk was given the assignment to write critically on the \\"ecclesiastical system\\" of Methodism. Sometime, in 1818, the Roxbury society was added to Shippensburg. Additionally, his time was divided ministering to Covenanter societies, in Newville, Walnut Bottom, Shippensburg, Green Township, Lurgan, and Waynesboro, small Pennsylvania towns scattered from some distance from his regular charge (mainly along what is today, Pennsylvania Route 997). However, he remained the stated, regular pastor of the Conococheague congregation until he tendered his resignation. Increasing participation in ecclesiastical governance =Activities on behalf of Synod= On December 15, 1818, he, along with Revs. Alexander McLeod and William Gibson, participated in the regular organization of the Baltimore, Maryland, Reformed Presbyterian congregation and the installation of John Gibson as its pastor. On August 10, 1819, the Synod of the Reformed Presbyterian Church met in Conococheague, John Cannon (who would again, in 1833, preside over the split into \\"Old Light\\" and \\"New Light\\" factions) presided, as moderator. At the beginning of this Synod, Lusk arose to read some of the minutes of the committee of Middle Presbytery relating to John Gibson's ordination and installation at Baltimore, after which Gibson was requested to be seated in Synod.Extracts from the Minutes of the Synod of the Reformed Presbyterian Church, Session VIII-1819. At the close of Synod, he was requested to preach the opening sermon, on the substitutionary nature of Christ's sufferings, at the next meeting of Synod, to be held in 1821 at Samuel B. Wylie's church in Philadelphia. On December 19, 1819, Lusk was once again in Baltimore, Maryland, where he and Alexander McLeod would help administer the sacrament of the Lord's supper for the first time in that congregation. In 1821, Lusk opened the Synod with a sermon preached on Isaiah 53:5, \\"But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities, the chastisement of our peace was upon him: and with his stripes we are healed.\\"Extracts from the Minutes of the Synod of the Reformed Presbyterian Church, Session IX-1821. It must have been a pleasing performance; Synod requested he revise and submit a copy of the sermon to them, presumably for future publication. John Gibson was selected to be moderator and Lusk drew an assignment on the committee for Presbyterial reports. At this Synod, a resolution passed that members of Freemason Lodges could not be admitted into communicant membership in the Reformed Presbyterian Church. Synod's confidence in Lusk's competence in increasingly complex ecclesiastical matters is evidenced, when he, along with John Cannon, Samuel Wylie and James R. Willson, was chosen for the committee to reorganize and assist the Southern Presbytery. This Lusk and Cannon accomplished in the Spring of 1822. The success of the commission is attested by Cannon: :April 3, 1822. I went by the appointment of Synod, on a commission to South Carolina, where I met with Mr. Lusk, my fellow commissioner. There, in five weeks, Christ, by us, settled all disputes in that part of our church, rectified disorders, ordained Messrs. Maddan and H. M'Millan, administered the Lord's supper, and organized the Southern Presbytery. By God's blessing, I arrived safely at home on June 8.\\"Memoir of the Rev.

Spalding. =Beginning of controversies= In the midst of the Synodic meeting, the Philadelphia Presbytery presented a reference and documents which, then, were referred to the committee on Order and Discipline. It was a case carried up from the session of Conococheague. The next day, October 23, after review, Synod found no warrant for interference in the case. Nonetheless, they did find it advisable to inform the Philadelphia Presbytery that the moderator of any session has a duty to put forth any motion regularly submitted for sessional consideration. This, they instructed, was a matter of Presbyterian order. If the moderator had any reason to object, he may do so by appeal to a superior church court. Lusk being the moderator of the Conococheague session, this is the first indication of the trouble that was to erupt. The monetary root of the personal turmoil Lusk had been pastor in Conococheague since 1816. As such, he had been promised a set salary for his labors. Over the course of several years, the congregation had failed to pay all the monies owed. Lusk had kept an \\"account\\" against the congregation. According to Lusk, he sold the \\"account\\" (i.e., the debt) for the best advantage he could obtain because the Synod had acted to defraud him of \\"upwards of $2000.\\" Furthermore, he claimed that, contrary to his critics, \\"To sell the account was as proper as to sell his horse.\\" His father-in-law, Thompson (or Thomson), together with John Renfrew, had brought the matter of Lusk selling the debt and the suit that followed before the Philadelphia Presbytery. Through the Presbytery, Samuel B. Wylie preferred charges against Lusk of \\"suing the congregation and disobeying the presbytery.\\" Lusk claimed the court docket, in the civil transaction, for the case against the congregation showed that the counsel (i.e., lawyer) for the purchaser of the debt was also in the employ of Samuel B. Wylie. Additionally, Wylie and his nephew, Samuel Wylie Crawford, held a mortgage, for $10,000, against John Thompson, who was also one of the ruling elders of the Conococheague congregation. In 1821, as the moderator pro tem, Samuel B. Wylie also had the opportunity to nominate the committee that would be commissioned to report on the charges against Lusk. The \\"jury law\\" and the ecclesiastical turmoil In addition, there was the continued agitation of opposition to the standing testimony of the Church. According to Lusk, at the Synod of 1821, Alexander McLeod \\"reported to Synod: 'That no connection with the laws, the officers, or the order of the State, is prohibited by the church, except what truly involves immorality.'\\" This met with staunch opposition.Lusk, Robert. \\"Characteristics of the Witnessing Church.\\" Contending Witness (serialized 1841‚Äì1843) ed. David Steele. Xenia, Ohio: J.H. Purdy. A few days after, on the morning of October 23. Samuel B. Wylie tactically \\"requested an extrajudicial meeting of members at his house when they would adjourn at noon.\\" They met, and two questions were put to each of the several members. The first asked whether or not a new edition of Reformation Principles Exhibited, the Testimony of the church, be published. All were in agreement respecting its desideratum. The second question asked whether the earlier Acts of the church which prohibited swearing oaths before magistrates and sitting on juries ought to be left out of the new edition. These questions were beginning to agitate amongst those in the ministry and the Church was of two minds on these matters. At Wylie's house, no reasons were admitted in answer to the query. Only Gilbert McMaster, James Milligan and Lusk opposed the measure. When Synod reconvened, later that afternoon, the motion was put forward to omit the Acts from the Testimony and place them in a \\"digest.\\" It was carried immediately, only finding opposition in Lusk, Gilbert McMaster, and James Milligan. Lusk was beginning to question the motives and methods his colleagues were utilizing to amend the Testimony of the church. Over twenty years later, when relating this account, he compliments the \\"projectors\\" for their craft and laments the trickery he perceived on their part which effectively hid the law of the church from generations following. The matter was sufficiently unclear that it arose again, in the next Synod, and had to be referred to a committee. Wylie would use this tactic again, in 1832, after he and his \\"New Light\\" friends were unable to carry their point during the session of the meeting of the Eastern Subordinate Synod. In 1806, The Reformed Presbytery had resolved that, \\"it appears to this Court that serving on juries in the civil courts of judicature in the United States or in any one of the States, is inconsistent with the Testimony of the Reformed Presbyterian Church.\\"Minutes of the Reformed Presbytery of America from 1798 to 1809. And Digest of the Acts of the Synod of the Reformed Presbyterian Church, in North America, from 1809 to 1888. With Appendix. Philadelphia: Jas. B. Rodgers Printing Co., 1888. Indeed, in Reformation Principles Exhibited, published in 1807, the Reformed Presbytery had declared that, \\"Jurors are executive officers created by the constitution.\\" Additionally, they noted, \\"The juror voluntarily places himself upon oath, under the direction of a law which is immoral.\\" They concluded, \\"The Reformed Presbytery declare this practice inconsistent with their Testimony, and warn Church-members against serving on juries under the direction off the constituted courts of law.\\" Indeed, \\"Narrative\\" portion of Reformation Principles Exhibited stated that, \\"The act of Presbytery [in 1806] respecting serving on juries, is absolutely prohibitory.\\" This assertion becomes of greater interest, when it is realized that the same Presbytery, meeting in 1806, passed both the act concerning juries and, on May 15 instant, \\"unanimously\\" approved adoption and publication of the \\"Narrative\\" portion of Reformation Principles Exhibited. Included in the \\"unanimous\\" vote were ministers who were now trying to undermine the \\"law\\" embodied in that act. =\\"Occasional hearing\\" and discipline in the local congregation= During his Conococheague pastorate, in 1821, Lusk, and his session, were called to hear several cases relating to the practice of \\"occasional hearing.\\" At this time, both Covenanters and Seceders were very strict in their enforcement of the rule against \\"occasional hearing.\\" In at least two of the cases, two women, members of the Reformed Presbyterian Church, who had been citied for attending a Methodist camp-meeting, in Shippensburg. In the Reformed Presbyterian Church, admonition is the lowest degree of censure consisting \\"in warning the offender of his guilt, and in exhorting him to walk circumspectly for the future.\\"Book of Government of the Reformed Presbyterian Church. Albany: J. Munsell, 1842. The rule against \\"occasional hearing\\" was enforced and, perhaps, Methodism being a subject somewhat familiar to Lusk, the women were \\"severely admonished.\\" (emphasis added) Dissolving the pastoral relationship with Conococheague and accepting a new call =Growing dissatisfaction in Pennsylvania= Again, in October, 1822, Lusk visited the Elk Reformed Presbyterian congregation, near Fayetteville, Tennessee. They were still without regular ministry and, in the course of ministering to the people, Lusk administered the Lord's supper in a grove. Such was the life of an itinerating minister, in those days, serving the scattered societies of Covenanters. According to Glasgow, in his History, Lusk's ministry, at this time, \\"was neither a happy nor a prosperous one,\\" and when combined with attendant monetary difficulties, he resigned and was regularly released from the charge, on October 15, 1823. The unhappiness of Lusk's charge in Conococheague might have stemmed, in part, from the circuit riding required by the scattered Covenanter societies. It certainly was not relieved by his wife's death, sometime in 1823, shortly prior to his departure from Pennsylvania.Stevens, Warder William.

Indianapolis: B.F. Bowen, 1916. After all, this left him a widower with two young daughters and responsibilities that required a lot of travel away from home. This, exasperated by \\"monetary difficulties,\\" led to tensions within the congregation. These tensions are apparent at the opening of the Synod, in 1823. John Steele, a ruling elder, from the Conococheague congregation presented himself and desired to be seated. Lusk questioned the legality of his certificate, which was issued by the local session and signed by its clerk, ruling elder John Thomson. It was required for being a delegate to Synod. Lusk noted that the certificate lacked a copy of the protest against John Steele being sent as a delegate which was lodged by the moderator of the session. Since it was the usual role for the pastor to assume the position of moderator in the local session, Lusk is complaining that the congregation has sent John Steele as a delegate over his clearly stated objections. Lusk then presented his protest to the court of Synod and was overturned. John Steele, as a ruling elder, was seated.Extracts from the Minutes of the Synod of the Reformed Presbyterian Church, Session X-1823. =Two ministerial opportunities arise= As Synod proceeded, Lusk was assigned to the committee on the Signs of the Times, a committee entrusted with drafting causes of fasting and causes of thanksgiving. This was followed by a call for papers. At this time, two papers were presented from two societies related to the Elk Reformed Presbyterian congregation, near Fayetteville, Tennessee. Immediately following, Lusk petitioned Synod for a disjunction from the Conococheague congregation. On the following day, August 6, 1823, Synod granted Lusk's request. On August 7, the committee on Presbyterial Reports, upon examining the written documents pertaining to the \\"protests\\" in the Lusk case, in the Conococheague session books and papers of the Philadelphia Presbytery, recommended obliterating all minutes mentioning the controversies, saving only those minutes pertaining to his actual removal. Furthermore, they confirmed granting the disjunction. The same day, the Synod received a second call for Lusk from the Walnut Ridge congregation, Washington County, Indiana. This was referred to the committee handling the papers from Elk congregation. The morning session ended that day with Lusk requesting his protest against the decision of the court (recommending the destruction of minutes and, presumably, all official records of the controversy) be duly noted. He said he was obliged to \\"protest\\" and would furnish his reasons later. On August 11, Synod enjoined Lusk to deliberate quickly and indicate which, if either, of the calls he would accept. On the last day of Synod, August 12, Lusk informed Synod of his intention to accept the call from Walnut Ridge. Whereupon, Synod instructed the Philadelphia Presbytery to issue a certificate of honourable dismission to the Western Presbytery. The Western Presbytery was, in turn, instructed to make no delay installing Lusk as pastor of Walnut Ridge. If Lusk was considered the instigator of the controversy that preceded his departure from Conococheague, it seems highly unlikely that two diverse regional societies of Covenanters would have tendered him a call to the ministry. The conclusion seems borne out by the fact that Synod, at no point, indicates an inclination to censure, or in any way discipline, Lusk for the controversy. In fact, it is hard to imagine Synod enjoining a candidate of dubious morals or practice to make a timely decision relative to future pastoral settlement. Additionally, they \\"instructed\\" lower church courts to dismiss Lusk honourably and receive him readily. Yet, there clearly was a controversy. It was a controversy that issued in the call for the destruction of minutes by a committee of Synod and a solemn protest on the part of Lusk. In fact, it appears that the controversy surrounded protests made by Lusk to the Philadelphia Presbytery. It appears that these \\"protests\\" lodged with Presbytery, which became part of the referral to Synod, fueled his desire to leave Conococheague. Apparently, Presbytery and Synod blunted the intended discipline of his \\"protests.\\" =Synod and \\"occasional hearing\\"= Lusk found himself involved in one other controversial matter at Synod that year. The Bethel, Illinois congregation petitioned the Synod for guidance in some matters of discipline. It was a question concerning \\"occasional hearing.\\" Synod opted not to enter into the merits of the question. Instead they rehearse a general concern for discipline amongst the congregations but leave it entirely to the \\"discretion of the local authorities,\\" which might be construed as allowing cases of \\"occasional hearing.\\" Yet, they eschewed Synodical interference by enjoining a strict adherence to the \\"good old way.\\" An amendment was proposed to address the specific concern of the petition. A motion was made to insert the words, \\"to apply the principles of the church, to cases as they occurred,\\" before the phrase \\"local authorities.\\" By \\"local authorities,\\" the petition meant sessions. Lusk was one of four supporting the insertion. Without that clause, according to Lusk, \\"news carried that the Synod had done away [with] occasional hearing.\\" Relocation to Indiana and second charge In 1823, Lusk removed to Indiana, along with his two young daughters, travelling by flatboat along the Ohio river. His journey was as an itinerant minister and, in time, he arrived at Walnut Ridge. Over the course of two weeks, he preached from house to house amongst the faithful adherents of the Reformed Presbyterian Church. After this, he was installed pastor of the congregation of Walnut Ridge, Washington County, on October 7, 1824.History Of Lawrence, Orange, And Washington Counties, Indiana: From The Earliest Time To The Present: Together With Interesting Biographical Sketches, Reminiscences, Notes, Etc. Chicago: Goodspeed Bros. & Co., 1884. His ministry was successful and the congregation grew, eventually erecting a log meeting house. =New domestic relations= Around this time, he also married his second wife, Miss Mary Reid, of Walnut Ridge, Indiana, in 1824. With her, he had an additional nine children, Margaret Holliday (1825‚Äì1857), Samuel Adams (1827‚Äì1880), Elizabeth (1829‚Äì1857), Grizzel (1831‚Äì1911), William Reid (1833‚Äì1916), Robert (1836‚Äì1857), Isaiah Reid (1838‚Äì1862), Isabella Maria (1841‚Äì1933), and the youngest was a son, named David Steele Lusk (1844‚Äì1916; clearly named after his fellow \\"controversialist\\" and ministerial colleague). Somewhat unusual for that time, all eleven children survived him. Additionally, five of his children lived into the 20th century. Upon arriving in Walnut Ridge, Lusk entered two eighty acre tracts of land from the government, thus acquiring a homestead. Lusk spent his time in Walnut Ridge farming extensively and ministering to the Covenanters in the area. This property was later conveyed to his son William Reid. Being widely regarded as an educated man, in a place, at that time destitute of many educational opportunities, his influence grew. His home became a seminary of study, as young men came from afar to borrow his books and to receive his tutelage. =The genesis of the charges brought against Lusk= After Lusk's arrival, he learned of the existence of a Masonic Lodge, in the neighboring town of Salem, Indiana. \\"Mr. Lusk, 'as a minister and a witness,' among other social sins, had borne public testimony against Freemasonry.\\"Steele, David. Reminiscences. Historical and Biographical of a Ministry in the Ref'd Presbyterian Church, During Fifty-Three years. Philadelphia: William Syckelmoore, 1883. Shortly, after Lusk's installation as pastor, his medical skills and hospitality became the occasion for the charges that would lead to his first expulsion from the ministry by the Reformed Presbyterian Church of North America. A member of the Walnut Ridge congregation had fallen ill. Lusk took him into his house, tended to his illness, thus offering room and board together with medical care, during the man's protracted illness. After his recovery, in seeming gratitude and recompense, the man engaged in the clearing of some of Lusk's farm. Afterward, this man being, in the words of David Steele, \\"inveigled into the lodge,\\" he ceased to be a member of the Walnut Ridge congregation. Upon becoming a Freemason, whether for personal revenge for being cast out of the church, or at the instigation of the Lodge, he stepped forward and accused Lusk, his former pastor and benefactor, of defrauding him of his services in clearing the land. Lusk, when confronted, \\"made oath\\" that he did not owe the amount of the prosecutor's claim. From this arose the fama clamosa that formed the basis of the charges brought before the next Synod. Clashes with synodical authority =The Synod of 1825 and deposition from the ministry of the Reformed Presbyterian Church= The Synod of 1825 convened in New York City, on August 2. James R. Willson preached the opening sermon. Lusk and Samuel Wylie [not Samuel B. Wylie] were the only two ministers from the Western Presbytery.Extracts from the Minutes of the Synod of the Reformed Presbyterian Church, Session XI-1825. On August 5, papers were recorded from Walnut Ridge, Princeton, Indiana, and South Carolina. These were referred to the committee on Discipline and pertained to the question of the \\"jury law.\\" The \\"jury law\\" was again before the Synod. Any harmony on this question had disappeared years before, now the factions were forming. On August 8, the Synod reported and attempted to quell the \\"misunderstanding\\" by passing a resolution that stated that Synod never intended to contravene \\"the old common law of our church on that subject.\\" It was further resolved that this be made known in the Southern Presbytery. Glasgow has noted the \\"discord\\" present in that Synod, particularly with regard to ministers and members involvement in matters of \\"civil government\\" (e.g., the \\"jury law\\"). Two prevailing parties were forming. This double-mindedness would lead to the rupture and division into \\"Old Lights\\" and \\"New Lights,\\" in the Synod of 1833. Presbyterial incompetence discovered by Synod On the morning of August 9, the special committee assigned to review the Presbyterial charges against Lusk was called to give report. In the meanwhile, Lusk observing he had communications to make, \\"presented two papers to the Moderator,\\" James Milligan, \\"intimating verbally his purpose of withdrawing from our connexion, and bidding the Moderator farewell, he left the house.\\" As is apparent from what follows, Lusk regarded not only the charges sustained by the Western Presbytery as baseless, he also must have raised some question as to ability to receive a fair trial under that jurisdiction. Immediately before addressing his case, the special committee expressed its \\"decided disapproval\\" of the conduct of the Western Presbytery in its handling of another disciplinary matter. Their disapproval was with regard to the Western Presbytery's admission and incorporation of \\"foreign and libellous matter\\" in their report. In other words, they had sustained charges without ample witnesses and augmented these charges with matter that might have been pejorative but certainly was immaterial to the matter at hand. This committee, consisting of Alexander McLeod, James R. Willson and Hugh McMillan, then began to address the case of Lusk. They began with the resolution that \\"the Rev. Robert Lusk be disannexed from the Western Presbytery, and that he be attached to the Presbytery of Pittsburgh. Indicating that the committee lacked confidence in the Western Presbytery with regard to this matter. Lusk's \\"protest\\" and \\"declinature\\" With this resolution before the court, Synod moved that the papers Lusk deposited with the moderator be examined. The committee was instructed to suspend any further comment until the general import of Lusk's papers could be determined. Some years later, Lusk noted that he left because he had concluded that the Synod was null in its organization and, therefore, its acts were all void. For example, he noted, the Presbytery of Philadelphia had supplied six members in their delegation to Synod, but none of them were certified by the Presbytery. Furthermore, by standing statute, at that time, the Philadelphia Presbytery was only entitled to send four delegates. He was concerned it was a packed court and so, \\"neither a lawful meeting nor a free court.\\" This, in some measure, was what he told them in his papers‚Äîthe first, his \\"protest;\\" the second, his \\"declinature.\\" The minutes state that upon \\"examining Mr. Lusk's papers, which were almost illegibly written, it was found that they contained a 'protest' and 'declinature,' and declared the authority of this court a nullity.\\" Thus, Lusk departed what he believed to be an unlawful meeting and \\"disregarded its charges.\\" The court of Synod responded by issuing a summons for Lusk to return, appear and \\"answer such questions as might be proposed to him, and to read his own papers.\\" The citation was delivered to him, at his place of lodging, attended with witnesses. Lusk refused to answer and did not appear. A second time he was summoned, this time James Milligan accompanied the citation. Lusk made Milligan to understand that he had no intention of returning to appear before Synod. After all, he deemed it unlawful and its acts void. The following morning, August 10, Lusk was summoned a third time, to appear at 9 am before Synod, but he could not be found. His concern that the court was packed, undoubtedly arose from his increasing distrust of those presbyters who openly, or secretly, were espousing what would later be denominated \\"New Light\\" views. The ministers from the Philadelphia Presbytery, Samuel B. Wylie, John Gibson and Samuel W. Crawford, would all go out in the split, in 1833. Their sympathies were already becoming known. Additionally, in 1828, the Synod adopted a series of Rules for Directing the Proceedings of Synod in which Lusk's concern about members being certified is addressed. Rule No. 2 stated unqualifiedly, \\"The members of the Court shall be ascertained‚Äîthe Clerk calling for, and publicly reading their certificates of appointment, from their respective Presbyteries.\\"Extracts from the Minutes of the Synod of the Reformed Presbyterian Church, Session XIII-1828. It was also reported that, in the Synod of 1831, there was no little controversy surrounding the attempt of the Philadelphia Presbytery to pack the court. They showed up displaying total disregard for the delegate system established and proceeded to try to get all of their members seated in Synod. After much heated exchange, they failed to accomplish their designs.\\"Sessions of the Synod of the Reformed Presbyterian Church, in August, 1831, Philadelphia.\\" The Albany Quarterly. 1.2 (1832) ed. James R. Willson & Samuel M. Willson. Albany, New York: Hosford and Wait. From the standpoint of Presbyterian procedure, the Synod had admitted that Lusk was right to raise his concerns. From the standpoint of Presbyterian law, the Synod of 1825 had violated the trust of the delegate system established by the Presbyteries and its organization was, therefore, at best, questionable; at worst, Lusk was right, it was a nullity. Suspension and deposition On August 10, 1825, the final day of the Synod, the matter concerning Lusk was again taken up. At this point, the court declared that Lusk had been \\"notorious\\" in his pursuit of \\"a disorderly course, in violation of the obligations by which he was bound to promote the edification and unity of this church, which has issued in his renouncing the authority of this Court, in contradiction to his ordination vows.\\" Lusk, when he had been ordained, had among other things, vowed to be in subjection \\"to the superior Judicatories of this Church in the Lord, and engage to follow no divisive courses from the doctrine and order which the Church has solemnly recognized and adopted.\\" Upon this finding, Synod declared Lusk suspended from the exercise of his ministry, and from church fellowship. Additionally, the pastoral relationship was declared dissolved and the pulpit of the Walnut Ridge congregation was declared vacated by authority of Synod. Samuel Wylie was asked to preach a sermon to the congregation clearing the matter, or if not in his power, his substitute was to be Gavin McMillan. In this connection, Glasgow mentions the charge of defrauding his neighbor, which, although not expressly mentioned, was certainly that which gave occasion to all that followed. Lusk perceived a difference between subjection to his ministerial brethren and subjection in the Lord to his brethren. He chose the later course. At the Synod of 1827, it was enquired of Samuel Wylie, whether or not he had carried out the orders of Synod by declaring, in the bounds of the congregation of Walnut Ridge, the dissolution of the pastoral relationship and Lusk's suspension and deposition. He replied that he had attempted to carry out the wishes of Synod, but had been \\"prevented by the congregation.\\" His alternate, Gavin McMillan, reported he had managed to carry into execution the orders of Synod.Extracts from the Minutes of the Synod of the Reformed Presbyterian Church, Session XII-1827. =Re-application, review and restoration to the ministry of the Reformed Presbyterian Church= \\"Wilderness\\" obscurity Lusk remained in the vicinity of Walnut Ridge, on his farm, and he continued to preach. Some years later, upon making application to be restored to the Reformed Presbyterian Church, we find one complaint to be addressed, that he did for some time, continue to exercise the duties of the ministerial office, as though no censure had been inflicted, thereby leading one of our congregations into an act of rebellion.\\"Minutes of the General Synod of the Reformed Presbyterian Church, Session Seventeenth, Met in the City of Pittsburgh, October, 1834.

Clearly, someone did not appreciate his refusal to acquiesce in what he deemed the void act of an unlawful meeting. The fact that the Walnut Ridge congregation also resisted Synodic authority and the people, in some measure,Reformed Presbyterian Church of Walnut Ridge (Salem, Ind.). An abstract of the proceedings of the Reformed Presbyterian Congregation of Walnut Ridge: of the Reformed Synod and Western Presbytery; with the reasons for separating themselves from said courts ... Louisville: S. Penn, 1826. 16pp. still attended his preaching, was a sore memory. Walnut Ridge reports having no minister between Lusk's suspension and restoration. According to David Steele, there he \\"lived for some years in comparative obscurity in an almost literal wilderness in the southern part of Indiana, and under an act of suspension by General Synod in New York city in 1825, for his faithfulness.\\" However, his interest in ecclesiastical matters did not wane, for he kept abreast of the happenings in the Reformed Presbyterian Church and read the publications of her ministers. =Making application to the proper Church court= In 1833, the Synod, which had been in turmoil for some years, finally split into \\"Old Lights\\" and \\"New Lights.\\" This event proved to be the catalyst to move Lusk to seek rapprochement. Steele, who had been clerk at that eventful Synod of 1833, relates, \\"After our division in Philadelphia, 1833, Mr. Lusk charitably hoped that we who were known as \\"Old Lights\\" were purged from preceding error and disorder. Having read our Minutes, and seeing my name as Clerk, he addressed me by letter, in which he said, 'These are the first honest Minutes of Synod, and the only ones that can be legally used as testimony.' He also expressed his desire for restoration to our fellowship. In reply, I encouraged him to make regular application to the Ohio Presbytery.\\" Petitioning the Synod On October 14, 1834, Synod received a petition signed \\"R. Lusk.\\" It was read and referred to a special committee to consist of three members. The moderator, Robert Gibson, in turn, referred appointment of persons to Synod. This may have been because he was the brother of John Gibson and sought to avoid any charges of partiality. After all, his brother had been one of those whose integrity and honesty Lusk had questioned in his \\"protest,\\" in 1825. Nonetheless, the court appointed him, along with Charles B. McKee and Thomas Gemmil, a ruling elder. Samuel M. Willson, brother of James R. Willson, and John Houston, another ruling elder, were added, and the committee granted power \\"to call for persons and papers.\\" At 3 pm, that same day, Robert Lusk appeared before the committee and was heard, but further consideration was deferred. On the following afternoon, October 15, his petition was taken up for farther consideration and was reviewed, article by article. Lusk was \\"interrogated\\" as to his sorrow for the course he had pursued. His expressions the court found \\"highly satisfactory.\\" Lusk, for his part, expressed his \\"entire submission to the court in the Lord.\\" (emphasis added) Which is to say, he pledged his submission to the court as long as they acted in accordance with Scripture and the received discipline of the Reformed Presbyterian Church. It was, as events would prove, in 1840, not intended to be an unqualified submission. =First resolution= The first resolution of Synod was somewhat hampered by lack of documents. They acknowledge their inability to review the \\"merits\\" of Lusk's case due to lacunae of evidence. They, therefore, assume the correctness of the previous decision of the Synod of 1825. After all, they note, it was predicated upon Mr. Lusk's \\"declinature.\\" This assumption would change by the end of the investigation. During the Synod of 1834, someone, who had been present at the Synod of 1825, had openly charged, that the act of Synod, held in New York, in 1825, resulting in the suspension of Lusk, \\"passed, through the influence of malice.\\" Thus, according to one present, in 1825, were the \\"merits.\\" Lusk records, this was conceded by the reply: \\"That all [emphasis in the original] the members were not under the influence of malice.\\" To which Lusk remarks, \\"the leaders were.\\" Lusk continues, \\"The same speaker [who had attended the Synod of 1825], also asserted, that the moderator [James R. Willson] of synod, 1823, had ordered the clerk (John Black) more than once, to furnish the documents to Lusk, for which he had so often called,--and added:--that Lusk had been deprived of the liberty of speech in the Synod.\\" =Second resolution= The second resolution spoke to the fact that Lusk did not demit the ministry when suspended, in 1825. It calls for a Synodical rebuke before Lusk be restored to his former standing in the Reformed Presbyterian Church. It also makes mention, as an aggravation, that he led a whole congregation into rebellion. =Third resolution= The third resolution called for Lusk to be relieved of his suspension, upon submitting to the rebuke of Synod. Which, after enumerating their resolutions, they instructed James R. Willson to administer. To this, they add a caveat. Though they were restoring him to office, yet he was to forebear the exercise of the office until directed by the Presbytery of Ohio. From this, Glasgow concludes, these charges were thoroughly investigated by a Commission of Synod, and he was restored to his ministerial exercise, October 15, 1834. On October 15, he was restored to the office not the exercise of the ministry. =Fourth resolution= The fourth resolution addressed the fama clamosa. The Ohio Presbytery was directed to investigate the charge, nearly a decade old, as soon as possible. Based on their findings, they were instructed to \\"deal with Mr. Lusk according to the laws of the house of God.\\" This they would do, but not without some difficulty. The Ohio Presbytery investigates the fama clamosa =Two Commissions, two conclusions= Lusk made his application, in person, to the Ohio Presbytery, \\"earnestly\\" desiring them to send a commission and investigate the local fama clamosa. His petition was granted, and Charles B. McKee and John B. Johnston, with two ruling elders, including S. Hyndman, were deputed to investigate the charges of \\"fraud and perjury.\\" They were sent to Walnut Ridge, \\"to take testimony and report to Presbytery.\\" They collected what they said was \\"all [emphasis in the original] the testimony in the case,\\" and submitted the report to the next Presbytery, in 1835, Lusk also being present. Lusk, upon hearing the report read, complained of the partiality of the commission, especially the ministers. Apparently, McKee, the chairman of the commission, made an appointment to preach to the Presbyterians in Salem, Indiana, on his way to Walnut Ridge. The engagement made impossible completing the commission's duties. Lusk complained that \\"the Commission finally adjourned while two of his witnesses were standing on the floor!\\" In other words, they had not, as they had claimed collected all the testimony. Lusk requested another commission be appointed by Presbytery and his request was granted. This commission consisted of John Wallace, son of his former seminary classmate, and David Steele, along with William Ramsay and Robert Craig, ruling elders. Their assignment was to investigate the charge of partiality and, if found true, to gather the remaining testimony. The charge of partiality they found proved, \\"not only by the two witnesses who had been left 'standing on the floor,' but by other members.\\" The two reports of the two commissions were in conflict. The documentary evidence of the first commission had been demonstrated to be incomplete. After protracted discussion, the Presbytery referred the case to the Western Subordinate Synod for adjudication. =The Western Subordinate Synod adjudicates= When the Western Subordinate Synod met, Lusk was again present, and he was called upon to make his defense. John B. Johnston \\"argued and strenuously insisted\\" denying \\"the legality [emphasis in the original] of hearing the defendant at all!\\" Furthermore, he asserted, the court must rest their decision \\"solely on the written [emphasis in the original] testimony,\\" the very \\"documentary evidence\\" which was in dispute. At this point, James Blackwood, later moderator of the Synod of 1838, arose and administered a \\"stinging rebuke,\\" asking, \\"Moderator, shall this court be insulted by refusing to hear a culprit at your bar?\\" A motion followed immediately, without taking or asking for additional testimony, requesting Lusk to declare before Synod \\"his sorrow for having been the cause of so much trouble to the church.\\" As David Steele, who was present and a participant, notes, Lusk was not being asked to express sorrow for having committed the facts charged. Lusk, in tears, visibly shaken by the motion, replied, \\"Moderator, I cannot make that acknowledgement and be an honest man.\\" An amendment was offered. A member of the Subordinate Synod moved that the \\"for the word cause be substituted the word occasion. Mr. Lusk, understanding \\"the import and force of language,\\" and thus the difference, immediately assented. He was then \\"restored,\\" or as Steele expressed it, \\"rather recognized as in full possession of all the rights of a brother in the ministry.\\" After his restoration to the ministry he was appointed stated supply to the Princeton congregation, in Gibson County, Indiana. He was re-installed pastor of Walnut Ridge, on May 9, 1835. In both these connections he continued until the disruption of 1840. During this period of time, he rode to and from both Illinois and Pennsylvania, preaching to the faithful as opportunity presented itself. Exercising his ministry in subsequent ecclesiastical courts =Synod of 1836= \\"Possessing all the rights of a brother in the ministry,\\" a member of the Ohio Presbytery, Lusk appears again in the Synod of 1836.Minutes of the General Synod of the Reformed Presbyterian Church, Session Eighteenth, Met in the City of Pittsburgh, October, 1836.

Early in the day, on October 7, Lusk was assigned to the committee on the Signs of the Times, a committee designed to call attention to the current state of religion in both church and society. Later that same day, Synod notes the \\"happy issue\\" in his case and his restoration \\"to the exercise [emphasis added] of his office,\\" as reported by the Western Subordinate Synod. On October 9, he was appointed to a committee set to consider the \\"draught of a book of government.\\" On the last day of Synod, October 13, Lusk was appointed to the committee on the Signs for the Times to report at the next Synod, in 1838. The Brush Creek Memorial on \\"voluntary associations\\" At this Synod, the Brush Creek, Ohio congregation, pastored by David Steele, had memorialized concerning the involvement of various congregations in \\"voluntary associations,\\" particularly the American Colonization Society. The intention of the memorial, according to Steele was, not merely to address defects in the American Colonization Society, but to raise the issue of \\"voluntary associations\\" under whatever guise. Lusk would later confess that \\"he had not duly considered nor clearly perceived the corrupting and ruinous influence of existing voluntary associations, until Providence\\" had brought him into acquaintance with Steele. In this cause, it seems, Steele was first; however, they would find each other mutually instructive over the coming years. Synod ignored the broader issue and chose simply to \\"withdraw the approbation given to the colonization society, and transfer our approbation and patronage to the cause of abolition.\\" Steele, together with Lusk, James Faris, and several others dissented from the resolution of Synod and they requested their dissent be noted. The Armour McFarland case, the Ohio Presbytery and the action of the Western Subordinate Synod Prior to the meeting of Synod, in 1836, Armour McFarland, a probationer, a licentiate from Ireland, had received and accepted a call from the congregation in Utica, Licking County, Ohio. In June instant, David Steele was appointed to lead the commission of the Ohio Presbytery to ordain and install McFarland as pastor. When McFarland was called upon to deliver a lecture and a trial sermon, prior to his ordination. The lecture was well received. However, apparently, he taught in his sermon that repentance precedes faith, a tenet, not of Calvinism, but of Arminianism. According to Steele, he took down in writing the following from McFarland's sermon, \\"Some degree of true repentance necessarily precedes believing the gospel for salvation.\\" A sentiment the majority of the commission believed to be unsound. However, John B. Johnston thought otherwise. Accordingly, the commission sustained the lecture but not the sermon.Steele, David. \\"Foreign Correspondence.\\" London Scottish-Reformed Presbyterian Magazine. for 1866‚Äì1869. 3.2 (July, 1868) ed. John Cunningham. London: Judd and Glass, Phoenix Works, etc. The matter was referred back to Presbytery. When the court met, September 28, 1836, Lusk was present, and heard of this case for the first time. Steele relates that Lusk, as first, made light of it. \\"The young man had not sufficiently studied the subject,\\" he said. Additionally, Lusk told the Presbytery, \\"he thought in a brief interview he could easily convince him [McFarland] of his error.\\" Presbytery appointed another commission, this time led by Lusk to confer with McFarland. The consensus of the brethren in Presbytery was that Lusk was the fittest member to undertake the task. After the recess, allowing for the conference, the court was called to order and the result was asked of Lusk. \\"Moderator,\\" he replied, \\"your committee can report no otherwise than as reported by your Commission.\\" McFarland was suspended. The case was referred to the Western Subordinate Synod. Ohio Presbytery and preparation for the next Synod, 1837 In 1837, the first meeting of the Ohio Presbytery was held April 26, in Utica. The chairman of the standing committee [David Steele], appointed by the Presbytery, \\"to transact any business growing out of the case of Mr. Armour McFarland\\" reported. Although all six members of the committee had been notified of the intention to meet, three members were absent, including John B. Johnston. Without a quorum, the committee declined to meet. Since the time the McFarland case had been referred to the Western Subordinate Synod, John B. Johnston had been circulating letters throughout the Ohio Presbytery casting his fellow presbyters in an unflattering light. He had been so successful that another minister, Samuel McKinney along with several elders, made it clear that they intended to do something about it. It was rumored that they intended to ordain McFarland at the next meeting of Presbytery, in September, 1837. With this rumor circulating, and McFarland's attendant refusal to answer the court, the Presbytery held in April passed a resolution declaring the forfeiture of McFarland's licensure previously issued by the court. When Presbytery met, in September, 1837, near Brush Creek, Ohio, Johnston had, by letters, managed to assemble opposition. On motion from McKinney, it was resolved that steps be taken to secure McFarland's ordination as early as the following Monday. Steele and Lusk viewed this as high-handed subversion of the order of the Church. They protested and appealed to the Western Subordinate Synod. By vote, the elders present at the Presbytery appointed a committee to answer the reasons given in the protest. Johnston and McKinney were included in that committee. No answers were given, no investigation pursued; only plans to ordain McFarland without removing his suspension. The Western Subordinate Synod seeks compromise with both parties A few weeks later, the Western Subordinate Synod was set to meet, in Brush Creek, Ohio, in October 1837. The McFarland case had been sent up for review. The Ohio Presbytery was divided over McFarland's suspension, although a majority had acted to suspend him. The Western Subordinate Synod, being composed principally of the Ohio and Pittsburgh Presbyteries (the Western Presbytery being, at that time, small by comparison), the outcome would be determined by the strength of support McFarland could garner in the Pittsburgh Presbytery. Prior to its meeting, according to Steele, John B. Johnston's campaign of writing letters had worked to bias \\"the minds of the ministers of the Pittsburg Presbytery in favor of Mr. McFarland.\\" In fact, Steele commented, \\"It was known to all concerned, that for error and contumacy, Mr. McFarland had been laid under suspension by the Ohio Presbytery.\\" When the case was raised, the result was the appeal was sustained; however, the Western Subordinate Synod, divided the Ohio Presbytery in two, established the Lakes Presbytery, and the Lakes Presbytery, under the direction of John B. Johnston, ordained McFarland, October 5, 1837. This they proceeded to do without even bothering to vacate the suspension of the Ohio Presbytery. The Western Subordinate Synod was the creature of the Synod of 1831. Without dispute, the Synod had the power to \\"unmake\\" its creature‚Äîthe Subordinate Synod. However, the Synod, first erected in 1809, was the creature of the Presbyteries. As such, Synod possesses no power to \\"unmake\\" Presbyteries. In fact, the Western Subordinate Synod was two degrees removed from its source of authority (i.e., from Presbyteries to Synod to Subordinate Synod). The right of one Presbytery (i.e., the Pittsburgh), through its delegates, at Synod, not only to overthrow the judicial sentence of, but to divide, another Presbytery (i.e., the Ohio), is contrary to Presbyterian polity and order. \\"The power of the synod is not destructive of the power of subordinate courts.\\"McLeod, Alexander.The Ecclesiastical Catechism; Being a Series of Questions, Relative to the Christian Church, Stated and Answered, with the Scripture Proofs. New York: Hopkins & Seymour, 1806. The complicity of the Western Subordinate Synod, in this \\"illegal act,\\" did not go unnoticed by Steele or Lusk. =Synod of 1838= The Synod of 1838 was held in October, in New York. \\"The Synod was asked, in 1838, most respectfully, formally, and explicitly, to review and rectify some cases of high-handed tyranny, chiefly through the influence of that party who caused the lamentable breach in 1833; as some of the subjects of that tyranny were yet writhing under a sense of accumulated wrongs.\\"The Reformed Presbytery.

Willson, and William Cowan, Sr., a ruling elder. Upon motion, David Steele was added. The content remains unmentioned in the minutes, but its contents are not wholly unknown. Lusk states that he had requested a copy of the minutes of the sub-commission sent to Walnut Ridge, in 1835. In 1850, David Steele made public the specific nature of the contents of the letter: > Some thought it dutiful to call Synod's attention to these matters, and a > petition was laid before them, from Rev.

The report was \\"accepted, amended and adopted.\\" Lusk had identified what he, and others, believed to be the source of so much controversy over the preceding years. The defect, he believed, had led to the phenomena of \\"two people\\" in the womb of one mother‚Äîthe Reformed Presbyterian Church. Later he would give vent that the minutes styled his \\"petition\\" a \\"letter.\\" Writing on this matter, in 1886, David Steele would, again, identify this moment as one of great significance in the direction the Reformed Presbyterian Church was going. He relates, \\"A member was directed merely to answer the 'LETTER.' So the petition was deceptively called on the Minutes.\\" Describing the unruly nature of the Synod of 1838, he continued, \\"At that meeting a licentiate [Francis Gailey] and some adherents publicly declined the authority of Synod, amid tumult and personal violence too disgraceful for detail. They had previously entered into a Safety League.\\"Steele, David, Sr. CIRCULAR No.3.

Intended for those who need, and especially for those who desire such information. Philadelphia: N.P., 1886. The gathering issues and the definitive moment Years between Synods were proving to be fertile times for sowing more seeds of dissention. The period between the Synods of 1838 and 1840 would be no different. =Ohio Presbytery, the 1839 memorial and the 1840 choice of delegates= \\"Voluntary associations\\" The issue of \\"voluntary associations\\" was still live. At the Fall meeting of Presbytery, October 28, 1839, the committee appointed to study the \\"Brush Creek memorial\\" regarding \\"voluntary associations\\" was called to report. They began by noting, \\"the Church of Christ in regarding her own doctrines and order, is to be instrumental in the hand of her blessed Lord to effect moral reform and bless the earth with peace ; and that all confederacies, separate from her in organization, affecting to perform her exclusive work and obtain her appropriate object, are unauthorized by her glorious Head, form no part of the profession of her faith, nor exemplify the sanctified exercise of the constitutional powers of her members, and immoral, as a way or means, however otherwise desirable the object.\\" Then, they proposed the following resolutions be adopted by the Presbytery: :1. That members of the Reformed Presbyterian Church, unnecessarily familiar, confederate, or holding visible communion with the infidel or the heretic, is a violation of plighted faith and solemn covenant engagements. :2. That such confederacy is contrary to the authority and word of God. :3. That it is opposed to the approved practice of the Church; and‚Äî :4. That it does not manifest the intelligent and sanctified activity of the sensibilities or affections of the heart and the powers of the mind ;‚Äîall the active principles of the rational and accountable creature. The committee was composed of Lusk and Robert Wallace, his former seminary classmate. Presbytery asked that these resolutions be inserted in the Reformed Presbyterian magazine, but Moses Roney, the editor, did not comply. Flaws in the delegate system reappear In 1840, the Ohio Presbytery met shortly before the meeting of Synod held in June. The four constituent members of the Presbytery were Robert Wallace and his son John Wallace, together with Lusk, Steele and ruling elders. The rules of Synod provided that only three of four ministers in any Presbytery could be delegated to be accompanied by an equal number of ruling elders. The elder Wallace, who presided as moderator of Presbytery, and Steele were chosen to be delegates and elected without opposition. Lusk and the younger Wallace were nominated. Upon standing for election, each candidate received an equal number of votes. In Presbyterian courts, the moderator has no vote, unless there is a tie. In this case, the father cast the deciding vote for his son. Afterward, it was made clear that an additional elder had been recently ordained to effect this outcome. As Steele relates, \\"It had been well known for years preceding that the ministers were equally divided in judgment and practice on matters of grave interest to the whole church. To secure two of the three ministers as delegates to the supreme judicatory, and so help to carry popular measures, was the declared object of ordaining the new elder. So Mr. Robert Ardery, one of Robert Wallace's elders, distinctly understood. He was a man of intelligence and probity in the estimation of his brethren.\\" As Lusk and Steele saw it, the delegate system was allowing the court to be packed to \\"reach carnal ends by the votes of a majority.\\" When this account was challenged, in 1867, by Thomas Sproull, in the pages of the Reformed Presbyterian and Covenanter,Sproull, Thomas. \\"Facts Versus Misstatements.\\" Reformed Presbyterian and Covenanter. 5.1 (January, 1867) ed. Thomas Sproull. Pittsburgh: Bakewell and Marthens, 1867. Steele responded with the information needed to verify. Sproull published the response but remained unsatisfied with the imputation of motives.Sproull, Thomas. \\"Notice.\\" Reformed Presbyterian and Covenanter. 5.3 (March, 1867) ed. Thomas Sproull. Pittsburgh: Bakewell and Marthens, 1867. Whatever the motive, Lusk would not be a delegate, but he would be present for the confrontation. =Synod of 1840= The Synod of 1840 met in Allegheny, Pennsylvania, in June. The delegation from the Ohio Presbytery consisted in Robert Wallace, John Wallace and David Steele, ministers; and William McKinley, John Jamison and William Wylie, ruling elders. On motion, Lusk was added as a consultavive member.\\"Minutes of the Synod of the Reformed Presbyterian Church of North America, Session XX\\" The Reformed Presbyterian. 4.6 (August 1840) ed. Moses Roney. Newburgh, New York: J.D. Spalding. As Steele notes, \\"By a rule in all ecclesiastical courts, such a member has no vote, nor can he make or second a motion; but he is allowed to participate in the discussions.\\" The report of the Eastern Subordinate Synod concluded with, among other admonitions, a warning concerning \\"occasional hearing.\\" There was a strong statement in response to a letter from Dr. John T. Pressley, of the Associate Reformed Church, warning the Synod and her members against \\"occasional communion.\\" Additionally, much time was taken up concerning church government, particularly with respect to the office of deacon. Lusk was able to observe and converse, but he was unable to direct or enforce the matters to be discussed. He was as active as these restrictions allowed. The end of delegates and subordinate synods Late on the first day of Synod, the committee on Synodical Reports, consisting of James Blackwood, Robert Wallace and John Z. Willson, ruling elder, was given instructions. They were to determine the \\"propriety of abolishing the Sub. Synods and Delegated form of General Synod.\\" On motion from Blackwood, David Steele was added. On the afternoon of June 25, the committee reported. Blackwood reported with very little \\"preamble\\" that \\"the Sub. Synods be directed to adjourn sine die, at the close of their next sessions, and that the delegation system be abolished after the present sessions of General Synod, and the Synod be constituted as it was previously to the year 1825.\\" According to Steele, Blackwood insisted Steele write the report himself. He complied and, with the seeming consent of the chairman, he recommended \\"abolishing the delegation form of the General Synod, by an orderly action of the presbyteries, from which it had derived its existence.\\" He knew what he had penned, but had no knowledge of whether or not others on the committee had been consulted. He expressed surprise and chagrin when Blackwood, on the following day, \\"offered the astounding and unpresbyterial motion\\" which called for the abolition of both the delegation form and the two Subordinate Synods. However, for Lusk and Steele, the defining controversy played out over the course of the duration of Synod. \\"Voluntary associations\\" and paper #30 The afternoon of the first day of Synod, June 16, a petition was received from the Walnut Ridge congregation asking Synod to take action on the pressing matter of \\"voluntary associations.\\" This paper was marked No. 6 and, on motion, referred to the committee of the Signs of the Times. This committee was composed of James R. Willson, John Crozier, and John Jamison, ruling elder. On the morning of June 18, upon \\"enquiry being made,\\" with respect to this petition marked \\"6,\\" \\"the answers were deemed satisfactory.\\" Apparently, not all found the situation with paper No. 6 satisfactory. On the afternoon of June 24, David Steele presented a \\"preamble and resolutions\\" in relation to \\"voluntary associations.\\" This was promptly marked No. 30 and, on motion, was laid on the table awaiting the report from the committee on the Signs of the Times on that subject. Paper No. 30 contained the following \\"Preamble and Resolutions\\": On the morning of June 25, the definitive moment arrived. The committee on the Signs of the Times reported \\"in part,\\" on paper No. 6, the Walnut Ridge petition on \\"voluntary associations.\\" \\"On motion, the report was accepted, and for the present, laid on the table.\\" Immediately after this, on motion, paper No. 30, containing the \\"preamble and resolutions,\\" was \\"taken up.\\" And then, on motion, from Thomas Sproull, the partial report on paper No. 6 and paper No. 30 \\"was postponed till the next meeting of Synod, with a view to early attention at said meeting.\\" In a published letter to Steele, after the Synod, Thomas Sproull admits that his motion was \\"not strictly in order to move to dispose of a paper lying on the table before a motion had passed to take it up.\\"Sproull, Thomas. \\"Letter to Rev. D. Steele.\\" The Reformed Presbyterian. 4.7 (September 1840) ed. Moses Roney. Newburgh, New York: J.D. Spalding. This led Steele to ask, \\"Why, then, did he violate known order?\\" He concluded, \\"No doubt he feared and hated the paper, as he described it in print as a 'firebrand,' for the instruction of those who had not seen it, and whom Mr. Sproull did not wish to see it.\\" As Steele and Lusk both understood it by now, presbyterial order was not the only thing that mattered; in fact, if the cause was deemed just, too many of their fellow presbyters appeared to them to have little regard for behaving as Presbyterians. The next Synod would meet in October, 1841, but Steele and Lusk would be absent, the course now clear in their eyes. The reconstituted Reformed Presbytery and remaining years =The generation work begins= On June 26, Synod adjourned with prayer and the singing of Psalm 133: > Behold, how good a thing it is, and how becoming well, Together such as > brethren are in unity to dwell!The Psalms of David in Metre: with > Annotations, Explaining the Sense, and Animating the Devotion by John Brown. > Pittsburgh: United Presbyterian Board of Publication, 1867. After the close of Synod, which Steele describes as, \\"public, irregular and unpresbyterial transactions,\\" several of those in the minority gathered together. After a \\"free exchange of views,\\" it was concluded that they should together constitute an independent presbytery. Accordingly, on June 27, 1840, Lusk, as the senior minister, together with David Steele, and three ruling elders, William McKinley, William Wylie and Nathan Johnston, constituted the Reformed Presbytery. On September 18, 1840, both he and Steele were stricken from the roll by the Ohio Presbytery, thus terminating his pastoral relationship with the Walnut Ridge congregation.\\"Proceedings of the Ohio Presbytery, with Remarks.\\" The Reformed Presbyterian. 4.10 (December 1840) ed. Moses Roney. Newburgh, New York: J.D. Spalding. =The freedom of ministry in the Reformed Presbytery= During the next five years, he ministered in and around the vicinity of Walnut Ridge to scattered adherents and participated in the courts of the Presbytery he helped erect. Presbytery 1840 Presbytery met and was constituted with prayer, on September 8, Brush Creek, Ohio. Presbytery resolved to appoint a committee to report on the \\"Deed of Constitution.\\" David Steele and Matthew Mitchell, ruling elder, were appointed to that committee. Lusk was added by vote.Minutes of Proceedings of the Reformed Presbytery, at Brush Creek, Adams County, Ohio, 1840. Xenia, Ohio: Free Press Office, 1841. Mr. Francis Gailey presented himself to the court as a representative of the \\"Safety League.\\" His credentials were sustained by the court. =The \\"Safety League\\"= On the afternoon of September 9, a committee consisting of Steele, Lusk and Mitchell received two documents. The first was a letter from William Wylie explaining his inability to be in attendance as a representative. Wylie had been an elder in the Baltimore, Maryland congregation of the Reformed Presbyterian Church, a congregation Lusk had helped organize, in 1818. In 1837, he had been ordained and, earlier in the year, his support in erecting the Reformed Presbytery was manifest when his name appeared affixed to the \\"Deed of Constitution.\\" His interest in being present was related to Mr. Francis Gailey. Since the resignation of the regular pastor, of the Baltimore congregation, in 1837, Gailey had often visited to preach. After Gailey had declined the authority of Synod, in 1838, many of the members of the congregation followed him and he continued to minister to them. Wylie's part in erecting the Presbytery was for a different end than the others, as began to appear in the second paper. The second was a petition from the elders in the \\"Safety League.\\" It was accompanied with documents and requested an ordination. Gailey was ministering as an unordained licentiate. As such, he was not supposed to administer sacraments. Those in the \\"Safety League\\" were eager to have that corrected. When the committee reported, September 10, they acknowledged the concerns expressed by the \\"Safety League\\" for a faithful testimony to be legitimate. Furthermore, they were aware of the great desire of the people in the Baltimore to have a regular minister. However, \\"judgment should not give place to feeling, so as in any measure to infringe upon presbyterial order.\\" They went on to recommend \\"farther interchange of views with the petitioners.\\" In short, they recommended patience. =The \\"Deed of Constitution\\"= On September 14, the committee for the \\"Deed of Constitution\\" reported. It began by chronicling the defections of the Reformed Presbyterian Church, since 1806, in matters of doctrine. First was the matter of the term \\"Testimony,\\" it was not \\"identical in its import with its former ecclesiastical use.\\" This led to a denial of the \\"historical\\" part as an article of faith (i.e., it was not a term of communion). From this error, the report asserts, came the \\"twofold view\\" taken of \\"occasional hearing\\" and \\"serving on juries.\\" It traces these effects through Synods of the Church, pointing out how this diversity had tainted the courts and, finally, made it impossible for the Church to address the issue of \\"voluntary associations.\\" In matters of worship, the report attacks two innovations in the practice of the Church. First, introducing devotional exercises into the meetings of Synod. The second, condemned the growing practice of \\"continuous singing\\" in both congregations and judicatories of the Church. Psalm singing in Synod was an innovation. To this innovation they added the second. In matters of government, the report raises the \\"deacon question.\\" Additionally, it points to the presbyterial problems incurred by the action of 1840 dissolving Subordinate Synods and abolishing the delegate system without the consent of Presbyteries. In matters of discipline, the mishandling of several cases, including that of Lusk and Gailey, are held out. The report is signed by Steele, as chairman. Nonetheless, many of the details from Synod, prior to 1830, and the majority of the issues addressed, indicate that Lusk was heavily involved in supplying matter for the report. On September 16, the court again considered the report and amended it paragraph by paragraph. Each review brought more amendments. Each amendment implied a desire on the part of the Presbytery to correct the errors of the past and act more faithfully in the future. Lusk, the precise ecclesiastic and the strict disciplinarian, found the new Presbytery a rarefied atmosphere in which to exercise his office. Presbytery 1841 Presbytery met next, according to adjournment, in Massie's Creek, Greene County, Ohio, on June 2. At this meeting Lusk was appointed moderator, a position he would occupy often for his last few years.\\"Minutes of the Reformed Presbytery. Greene County, Ohio.\\" Contending Witness 1.2 (June 1841) ed. David Steele. Xenia, Ohio: J.H. Purdy, 1841. =Ecclesiastical relations considered= At this meeting, Lusk and ruling elders Nathan Johnston and Thomas Steele were appointed to form a committee to report on \\"our ecclesiastical relations.\\" On June 3, the initial report was read and commented upon. On June 4, the amended report was adopted. It offers some introductory remarks regarding the Church. She should be \\"distinct from all other communities in organization.\\" It proceeds to acknowledge the presence of hypocrites in the true Church and their deleterious effect upon her organization. Then follows the first rule for recognizing enemies within the Church. \\"Opposition in profession, to any part of revealed truth is evidence of the ascendency of the carnal heat; and the relinquishment of acknowledged doctrine carries with it additional guilt, being a violation of voluntary engagements; and obstinacy in such defection must eventuate in the reprobation of the community.\\" Enemies from within could prevail over a particular community and claim to be an organization of the Church. In such cases, love of truth must move the sincere believer to \\"reprobate\\" that community. Next, follows a survey of the existing conditions of the Reformed Presbyterian Church in America, Scotland and Ireland. Each is subjected to scrutiny based on opposition to and relinquishing of the truth. The report concludes by denying the possibility of maintaining \\"communion judicially, ministerially, or in the dispensation of word and sacraments, with any of the aforesaid communities.\\" Lusk, as chairman, signed the report. The cause of division must first be removed. There would be no \\"occasional communion\\" with those who evidence they hold another faith. =Doctrinal queries reviewed and resolved= After the resolution of the matter of ecclesiastical relations, and a short recess, the court took up a some doctrinal questions, all related. Another committee was formed. This committee consisted of Lusk, David Steele, and Thomas Steele. Again, Lusk was appointed as chairman. The questions were moved by elder Nathan Johnston. They all revolved around the relation of fear, especially of hell, to believers. When Presbytery met the following evening, June 7, the matter was resolved. Among other observations, the committee stated, \\"'fear of hell' is 'inconsistent with saving faith.'\\" In other words, fear is in opposition to faith; and, therefore, \\"fear of hell,\\" which considers God, \\"in his judicial character,\\" can never provide a gospel \\"motive to obedience.\\" The Presbytery was strict in matters of discipline, but it maintained its theological Calvinism. All obedience, even the highest Presbytery or Scripture could require, could only be yielded by the grace of God. Presbytery 1842 The time intervening had seen the rift with the \\"Safety League\\" widen. Elder William Wylie made no more pretensions to belong to the Presbytery and members of the Presbytery had written of concerns with the organization. There were others seeking the Presbytery's help and they would receive attention. =April, 1842, and the petition to organize a congregation= When Presbytery met, on April 11, 1842, in Brush Creek, Ohio, Lusk was continued as moderator.\\"Proceedings of the Reformed Presbytery.\\" Contending Witness 2.2 (June 1842) ed. David Steele. Xenia, Ohio: J.H. Purdy, 1842. A petition was presented from William Thompson and others, Mercer County, Pennsylvania. In it, they express grief that \\"a majority\\" of the members of the \\"Reformed Presbyterian Covenanted Church\\" had made defection from the truth and abandoned covenanted attainments, as well as changing the \\"terms of communion.\\" They were seeking ministry and hoped to be organized into a congregation. A committee, composed of Lusk, Nathan Johnston and Matthew Mitchell, was appointed to report on the petition. On motion, a committee was then appointed to report on the \\"terms of Ecclesiastical communion adopted by the Reformed Presbytery in the United States in 1807.\\" As moderator, Lusk appointed David Steele, Nathan Johnston, and William McKinley. After deliberation, the following day, April 12, the committee chaired by Lusk to report on the petition of Thompson et al. recommended \\"a minister and ruling elder be appointed to repair to these people.\\" Presbytery would proceed with an optimistic caution. =October, 1842, and the report on holding court in Mercer= Presbytery met again in the Fall. This time in Massie's Creek. Again, Lusk was continued as moderator when Presbytery was constituted by prayer, on October 5.\\"Proceedings of the Reformed Presbytery.\\" Contending Witness 2.4 (October 1842) ed. David Steele. Xenia, Ohio: J.H. Purdy, 1842. The committee assigned to report on the petition from Mercer County, Pennsylvania reported that they had met in the town of Mercer, on May 19, 1842. Whilst there, Lusk and one of the ruling elders had constituted a session. Then, they began to review those applying for membership. Some were received without much controversy; others came under the shadow of ecclesiastical censure. They proceeded to hold court and re-examine evidence and, sometimes, witnesses. They report reversing the censures imposed by other communities and admitting into fellowship several who were deemed wrongfully charged. Lusk, who thought he understood being charged for \\"being faithful,\\" was setting about to right the wrongs he believed church courts had inflicted. The Presbytery was fulfilling its purpose. Presbytery 1843 =History as a term of communion= In October, 1843, the Presbytery met in Greenfield, Harrison County, Ohio, on the 9th. Lusk was continued moderator.\\"Minutes of Proceedings of the Reformed Presbytery; at Greenfield, Harrison County, Ohio, 1843.\\" Contending Witness 3.1 (June 1844) ed. David Steele. Xenia, Ohio: T.H. Blaker, 1844. The first paper that came before the Presbytery was a \\"petition and memorial.\\" It was submitted on behalf of the Miami, Logan County, Ohio, session and congregation. It sought to have the term \\"Testimony\\" \\"restored to its former use in the church.\\" That was intended, among other uses, to facilitate \\"renewal of the covenants as soon as practicable.\\" It was given to a committee and Lusk was appointed chairman. On the morning of October 10, the committee, with Lusk as chair, reported. After rehearsing the nature of the problem, the committee resolved, \\"That the term testimony, as limited in the preface to R[eformation] P[rinciples] Exhibited, be restored to its former use.\\" Lusk asserted in the report, that by restoring its use, the \\"distinctive practical traits of the church, as stated in the history,--such as occasional hearing, serving on juries, although doctrines, are thereby rendered void in their application,\\" if the Testimony of the church fails to encompass its historical application. Restoring the term testimony required restoring history as a term of communion. =Not lording over the LORD's people= Afterward, the \\"Overture\\" terms of communion, were brought forward. Because any change in terms of communion would affect everyone in communion with the Presbytery, they had to be finalized and submitted to every congregation for approval. Thus, it was merely \\"Overture\\" terms. On motion, the document containing them was referred to a committee. Lusk was chairman of this committee, too. When they reported, later that same afternoon, they began by acknowledging the voice of the people under their care with regard to the matter. They begin, \\"Inasmuch as some of our people have expressed a desire that the terms should remain numerically the same as heretofore; this can be easily effected,\\" etc. There would remain six terms of communion. Mindful of the problems created in the past by trying to impose changes without the consent of the people, the Reformed Presbytery sought to avoid that mistake. Certainly, Lusk's long experience had made him cautious in legislating. Presbytery 1844 During Lusk's life, 1844 would be the most active year for Presbytery. There was much work to accomplish restoring the Reformed Presbytery to its original basis. =May, 1844, and \\"historical testimony\\"= The first meeting of Presbytery, in 1844, was in Brush Creek, Ohio, May 6. Lusk was, again, continued as moderator.\\"Minutes of Proceedings of the Reformed Presbytery; at Brush Creek, Ohio, May 6, 1844.\\" Contending Witness 3.1 (June 1844) ed. David Steele. Xenia, Ohio: T.H. Blaker, 1844. The papers being read, Lusk, and ruling elders, Thomas Ralston and Thomas Steele were appointed to a committee to report on the first paper. It was a request that Presbytery formally acknowledge the \\"Historical part of the Testimony.\\" It was signed by Thomas Ralston and James Williams, Sr., elders at Brush Creek. On May 7, Presbytery met and constituted by prayer in the Associate Reformed Presbyterian meeting house, at Georgescreek. The committee on paper No. 1 reported. The committee warned about the effects \\"from innovations made on former habits of thought and of action.\\" This is especially true when it \\"affects the thoughts and the actions of the witnesses of Christ.\\" How can the faithful remain faithful in the face of these changing habits? They point to the fact that \\"the testimony of the Church of Christ has embraced declaration of doctrine, argument and history, each in its kind.\\" Embodying this testimony, the Church has been \\"a witnessing community, and her children,-- Witnesses.\\" Reformation Principles Exhibited had \\"despoiled\\" the \\"testamentary character\\" of \\"history and argument.\\" Consequently, the committee asserted, \\"from habit of thought and of practice, individual opinion in the community, was directly opposed to their public profession.\\" Therefore, they conclude, \\"the historical part of the book\\" [i.e., Reformation Principles Exhibited] be formally approved, and \\"be recognized in the formula of the terms of communion.\\" The Presbytery was approving the \\"Historical part,\\" but \\"only so far as it accorded with other standards of the church.\\" This qualified approval would fade, as Presbytery discovered more and more conflicts between Reformation Principles Exhibited, in America, in 1806, and the Act, Declaration and Testimony, emitted in North Britain, in 1761. For Lusk, the original Covenanters were to be preferred. The old paths were safer. On the last day of Presbytery, May 8, Lusk was appointed with John French, a ruling elder, to prepare causes of fasting and thanksgiving for the next meeting. They had many causes to fast, but the causes for thanksgiving were, from their perspective, increasing with each meeting of Presbytery. =October, 1844, and observing the times= When Presbytery met, October 23, in Logan County, Ohio, Lusk was continued as moderator. This time a reason was assigned. David Steele was indisposed. He was present, but unable to moderate the meeting.\\"Minutes of Proceedings of the Reformed Presbytery.\\" Contending Witness 3.2 (February 1845) ed. David Steele. Xenia, Ohio: T.H. Blaker, 1845. The morning of the following day, October 24, Lusk's committee on causes of fasting and thanksgiving was called to report. In began with the solemn reminder that everyone \\"should constantly bear in mind his accountability for the deeds done in the body; that after death the judgment.\\" The actions of men carry eternal consequences. More to the point, \\"from the concurrence of prophecy and providential developments, in the times wherein we live,\\" it had become apparent that comparatively few \\"of the professors of religion, are redeemed from the earth of anti-christianism.\\" Then, there follows an enumeration of the sins of the day. However, there were also causes for rendering thanksgiving to God. God's judgments are being poured out and the hope is expressed that the \\"period of Zion's sojourning in the wilderness\\" is drawing closer to its end. Hopeful signs are indicated. Lusk, as the chairman of that committee, had provided a voice for Presbytery. The duty of original Covenanters was to tremble at the thought and sight of sinful defections and backslidings; but, also, to rejoice in confidence that God's time would come. \\"When the LORD shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his glory.\\" Ps. 102:16. Their duty was to keep the testimony, to this, they believed, was a great and eternal promise annexed. The last matter of business for Presbytery was to appoint Lusk to moderate in a call, in the Miami congregation. He was also requested to administer the Lord's supper \\"in the same.\\" The court, then, on motion, adjourned, with the plan to meet within the bounds of the Miami congregation, merely ten days later. =November, 1844, and a ministerial call for Lusk= Presbytery met and was constituted by prayer, the afternoon of November 4, in Richland, Logan County, Ohio. Lusk was continued as moderator. At this meeting, Lusk laid before the court a call, \\"duly attested, as having been moderated by him, in the Miami congregation.\\" After examination, the court presented it to Lusk, \\"for acceptance or rejection.\\" The call had been unanimous and Lusk signified his intent to accept. Lusk, however, noted that his acceptance was contingent upon his being able \\"to make domestic arrangements\\" which would enable \\"him to fix his residence in the congregation.\\" Until these arrangements could be made, he requested the call remain in the hands of the Presbytery. They were to take it up, at their next meeting. Obviously, Lusk had to set his estate in order for a relocation. Presbytery 1845 Lusk was continued moderator at the last meeting of Presbytery he would attend. On June 2, at the Brush Creek meeting house, Presbytery met according to adjournment and was constituted by prayer.\\"Minutes of Proceedings of the Reformed Presbytery, at Brush Creek meeting house, Adams, O., June 2, 1845.\\" Contending Witness 3.4 (June 1845) ed. David Steele. Xenia, Ohio: T.H. Blaker, 1845. On June 3, David Steele assumed the moderator's chair. The business before the court centered on the increasing concern about the \\"sentiments in the American Testimony [i.e., Reformation Principles Exhibited] contrary to other standards of the church.\\" On June 4, the session was spent dissecting the \\"American Testimony.\\" The exercise ended emphaszing \\"that the application of the doctrines of the church is still binding.\\" Furthermore, they declare, \\"That no member of the church, without contracting guilt, in the present state of society, can take the oath of allegiance to the government of these United States, hold office, exercise the elective franchise, act as a juror, or hold communion in other bodies, by what is commonly styled \\"occasional hearing.\\" Presbytery did not intend to allow their indecision with respect to the \\"American Testimony\\" to allow a relaxing of the original Covenanter testimony. Lusk would participate in no repeat of the confusion wrought by the Synod of 1821 in their handling of the \\"jury act.\\" The last item Presbytery addressed was the call from the Miami congregation. As there was \\"no representation\\" from their congregation, it was ordered the call be continued on Presbytery's table. They adjourned with the plan to meet at Xenia, Ohio, the last Monday of May, 1846. They intended to take up the matter of Lusk's call then, but Lusk would not be there and the call would be mooted. =Death and legacy= Lusk's gravestone at Walnut Ridge Lusk's death came somewhat unexpectedly, on December 14, 1845, of erysipelas, more commonly called \\"holy fire.\\" He was 64 years of age. It was rendered all the more unexpected because, as David Steele recalled, \\"It was observed by his friends at the meeting of Presbytery last June, that he appeared to be in the enjoyment of better health than usual.\\" He left behind his second wife, Mary, and numerous offspring. His death dissolved the Reformed Presbytery until 1854. During his last five years, in connection with the Reformed Presbytery, as Steele recalled, \\"he was instrumental in framing the counsels and measures adopted.\\" It has been said that he was not considered a pleasing speaker, yet he was acknowledged to be an instructive preacher and gifted in prayer. His pulpit mannerisms were noted for being peculiarly his own. Steele later noted, \\"We have many a time heard from him expositions of obscure portions of the Bible, which carried their own evidence, although in opposition to the whole current of commentators.\\" =What's in a name?= Many years after Lusk's death, Steele would reminisce about the \\"many expressions of compassion\\" he received for being \\"misled by Lusk.\\"Steele, David. \\"Foreign Correspondence.\\" London Scottish-Reformed Presbyterian Magazine. for 1866‚Äì1869. 2.1 (January, 1867) ed.

In 1843, he published \\"Characteristics of the Witnessing Church,\\" and \\"Characteristics of Surrounding Communities,\\" in the Contending Witness, a magazine edited for the Presbytery by David Steele. He also published An Abstract of Grievances, &c.;, published in New York, in 1825, likely immediately after his \\"declinature\\" and may be the \\"communications\\" he said he had to make, when departing Synod, the morning of August 9, 1825. There was also printed, sometime around 1825, in Salem, Indiana, a publication entitled, Lusk's Prospectus, which also has bearing on his early clashes with Synod.

Description It has been suggested to mean bracken-land or come from the old plural for fairy; feren, who were said to be sacred to the ancient Cornish. Fernacre is one of the biggest stone circles in Cornwall. It is slightly flattened in a northwest to southeast direction, measuring by The circle contains some 68 or 69 stones with a further 3 displaced within, 38 or 39 remain standing upright. They are deeply sunk into the soil with the tallest stone measuring high and the longest fallen stone . Fernacre is a marker for the start of a medieval drove road from Rough Tor to Garrow. Archaeology The ruins of what was called Fernacre farm were first recorded in 1327 AD. Numerous hut circles dot the landscape nearby and it has been suggested that the dating for Fernacre is contemporary with these. No bones or remains were found in these hut circles, only a few flaked flints gave clues to its occupation. The Fernacre settlement covered 164 acres, of which 84 show signs of having been farmed. The dating of the sites is uncertain although it has been suggested to have been constructed either in the Neolithic or Bronze Age. There are signs that the circle had a retaining bank of earth on its southeast. Alignments Fernacre carries a pivotal location between Rough Tor located due north and Brown Willy located due east. Garrow Tor also lies to the east and Louden Hill to the west- southwest. It is only 100 ft from being in a direct line in an easterly direction between Stannon and Brown Willy Cairns, another small erect stone stands in this line eastwards on the way to Brown Willy which has been suggested to mark the equinox sunrise.

It branches in the Stuttgart district of Rohr from the G√§u Railway (G√§ubahn) and runs via Oberaichen, Leinfelden, Echterdingen and Stuttgart Airport to Bernhausen, a district of Filderstadt. It is now part of the Stuttgart S-Bahn. History  The Rohr‚ÄìEchterdingen section was built as an unemployment relief project in 1920 by the Deutsche Reichsbahn (DR) to connect with the Stuttgart- M√∂hringen‚ÄìNeuhausen auf den Fildern railway, that had been built by the private Filder Railway Company (Filderbahn-Gesellschaft) to create a better link with the DR network. The line was opened on 1 October 1920, with services running through to Neuhausen. This allowed passenger trains to run through without changing in Degerloch. Services from Echterdingen to Filderstadt were operated by Stuttgart Tramways (Stuttgarter Stra√üenbahnen, SSB) from 1920 and the Tramways took over the ownership of the line in 1934. In 1928 a branch line was opened from Leinfelden to Waldenbuch called the Siebenm√ºhlentalbahn (Siebenm√ºhlen Valley Railway). A track was laid in 1934 between Echterdingen and Bernhausen for the construction of the A8 and Stuttgart Airport. It was extended towards Denkendorf to take construction material along the autobahn as it was built and it also supplied construction materials and goods for the construction of the airport, which was completed in 1939. The route of the line was diverted to the east of Echterdingen station to Bernhausen in 1937 to run south of the airport area. The current S-Bahn route, however, largely follows the former construction siding. In 1955, passenger services on the Stuttgart-Rohr‚ÄìEchterdingen (‚ÄìNeuhausen) line and on the Siebenm√ºhlen Valley line were replaced by bus services; the line was now only used for freight traffic. The supplying of fuel and other goods to the airport by rail was abandoned by the end of the 1960s. At the same time the proposed Echterdingen link road was abandoned during the planning of the new Federal Highway 27 and the proposed use of the southern part of the military airport by the U.S. Army did not materialise due to community opposition. On 28 May 1983, freight traffic on the Leinfelden‚ÄìNeuhausen section was closed and the tracks on the SSB-owned route from Echterdingen to Neuhausen were soon removed. The tracks on the Deutsche Bahn section from Leinfelden to Echterdingen were closed for rebuilding in preparation for the S-Bahn a few years later. The last train to run on the original line before the reopening for the S-Bahn was an Uerdingen railbus from Echterdingenran in September 1985 during a special trip for the inauguration of the S-Bahn to Stuttgart-Vaihingen. The remaining Rohr‚ÄìLeinfelden section was still used occasionally for shunting freight until the early 1990s. It was used mainly to serve Leinfelden-based companies, but also for the transport of construction materials for the S-Bahn. The line was reconstructed for the S-Bahn from the mid-1980s, with the installation of double track, electrification and the partial undergrounding of the track. Curves were also straightened. A new line was created between Echterdingen and the airport. The preliminary plan for the Stuttgart S-Bahn included a Filder- Schnellbahn (Filder fast railway) between Stuttgart-Vaihingen and the Airport with a calculated construction costs of DM 47 million (1966 prices). Doubling of the track, an extension to the airport and electrification from Stuttgart- Rohr was planned. The project was to be realised in two phases from 1976 to 1978.  Current use  An exemption granted by Deutsche Bundesbahn in 1988 allows a particularly low contact wire height in the tunnel areas in Echterdingen and at the airport. The Stuttgart S-Bahn ran to Oberaichen from 27 May 1989 and it was extended to the airport on 18 April 1993. A total of DM 356.7 million was invested for the upgrade of the line to the airport. Of this amount, DM 260 million was covered by funds for the establishment of the S-Bahn. On 29 March 1993, it was decided to extend the S-Bahn to Filderstadt- Bernhausen. On 16 August 1993, the sixth contract for establishing the S-Bahn was signed. In 1994 and 1995, during construction work at the airport, an approximately 400-metre-long tunnel section was built as cut and cover. Subsequently, the remaining 2.2 kilometres were bored from 1998. The bored tunnel cost DM 129.5 million and the adjoining railway station cost DM 47.53 million. The town of Filderstadt provided funds of DM 31.8 million. The town spent an additional DM 22.5 million on further measures, such as commuter parking and the renovation of the old station building, Overall, the S-Bahn extension thus cost DM 199.4 million. A single-track extension was opened to Filderstadt-Bernhausen on 29 September 2001. The new station is underground but part of the roof consists of windows. Although freight traffic was originally planned between Rohr and Leinfelden, no freight traffic now operates over the line. A bridge in Leinfelden, which was built in 1993, was intended for a siding, but it was never used for this purpose; it has been used for Stadtbahn operations since October 2015. The line‚Äôs signal technology was improved in 2007 and 2008. As a result of this upgrade, which cost approximately ‚Ç¨1.7 million, S-Bahn services on the line can now operate at five-minute intervals. These measures became necessary because passenger traffic increases to two to three times as many as usual were counted on days with public exhibitions. Projects =Stuttgart 21 = The Stuttgart 21 project will mean that, in addition to the 148 S-Bahn trains per day that run on the Stuttgart-Rohr‚ÄìFilderstadt line today, 62 mainline and regional trains will be added to the line (in both cases the sum of both directions). The line will be used for the section between Stuttgart-Rohr and Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof instead of the G√§u Railway. Under the Stuttgart 21 project, the planned Rohr curve is planned to connect the line in Stuttgart-Rohr to the G√§u Railway running south. The exemption necessary for long-distance and regional services to run through the airport tunnel is controversial. At the eastern end of the airport station, a two-track connection is to be established to the new Stuttgart‚ÄìWendlingen high-speed railway towards Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof via the airport curve (Flughafenkurve). Planning approval for section 1.3 of the Stuttgart 21 project, which also covered the new construction and upgraded infrastructure on the Rohr‚ÄìFilderstadt railway, was sought in October 2002. Planning approval for some works in the later stages of the project is still pending. Between 25,200 and 36,100 passengers are expected daily between the Rohr curve and the airport, depending on the section of the line (sum of both directions) in 2025. This represents an increase of 6,400 to 10,600 passengers compared to 2010. The section between the airport and Filderstadt is expected to drop by 200 to 8,100 passengers. The extension of the line to Neuhausen is not included in the forecast. = Extension to Neuhausen = There are plans to extend the S-Bahn line to Neuhausen. The two-track line will include an approximately 3.9 kilometre-long section of new construction and new stations in Filderstadt-Sielmingen (in a cutting) and Neuhausen (above ground), each with 210 metres-long and 96 centimetre-high platforms. A storage facility for four S-Bahn sets will be provided in Neuhausen. The line extension is expected to run on the route of the old Filder Railway. In Bernhausen a tunnel is provided to the outskirts of Filderstadt/Bernhausen. Commissioning is scheduled for May 2019 (as of August 2013).

Of Flemish background,Morgan, T. Valley of Death: The Tragedy at Dien Bien Phu That Led America Into the Vietnam War. New York: Random House, 2010. p 249. Grauwin served as a surgeon during the Second World War. During the course of the First Indochina War, the French had established a base at Dien Bien Phu in late 1953. Dr. Grauwin, holding the rank of major, arrived in February 1954 to take charge of the 42-bed hospital unit there, conducting triage for evacuation and operating when necessary. After the Viet Minh siege began in early March, Dr. Grauwin was kept busy with large numbers of casualties that flooded his surgical bunker. While the airstrip at the base was still in use, he evacuated many of the injured back to Hanoi. Grauwin soon found his facilities overwhelmed with casualties who had to be put in the halls. In one night, he and another surgeon amputated twenty-three limbs, plastered fifteen fractures, and repaired numerous other wounds: ten abdominal, ten chest, and two cranial. At other times, shelling killed those waiting for medical attention. By the end of March Grauwin's hospital consisted of six shelters with 250 beds. Supplies dropped from the air included the contents of a United States field hospital with pajamas, sheets, cots, and vials of antibiotics. He also received two new aides, a Private Fleury and Genevi√®ve de Galard In the last week of April, with the airstrip no longer usable, Grauwin's hospital contained more than one thousand wounded, and he had begun using some of the women from the base's brothels as medical orderlies. By the end of the battle in May, Grauwin had more than 1,300 wounded in the makeshift wards of his hospital, and deprived by the shelling of electricity, was forced to operate by candlelight. With the fall of the base on May 7, he was taken into captivity by the Viet Minh. Grauwin remained in captivity until June 1, when he and other French medical officers were exchanged for several hundred Vietnamese prisoners. In 1954, Grauwin published a memoir entitled J'√©tais m√©decin √† Di√™n Bi√™n Phu, which was translated into English in 1955 with the title Doctor at Dien Bien Phu.

It has a tuft of between four and eight leaves at the base and up to three mostly yellow flowers with a few light- coloured marks. It is classed as \\"endangered\\" in Victoria. Description Diuris protena is a tuberous, perennial herb with between four and eight linear leaves long and wide in a loose tussock. Up to three flowers wide are borne on a flowering stem tall. The flowers are pale yellow with a few light brown markings at the base of the dorsal sepal and labellum. The dorsal sepal is held more or less horizontally and is egg-shaped, long and wide. The lateral sepals are narrow linear to lance-shaped with the narrower end towards the base, long, wide, turned downwards and parallel to each other. The petals are directed forwards with a more or less egg-shaped blade long and wide on a greenish-brown stalk long. The labellum is long and has three lobes. The centre lobe is egg-shaped, long, wide and the side lobes are oblong to wedge- shaped, long and about wide. There are two broad, pimply calli in the mid-line of the base of the labellum. Flowering occurs in August and September. Taxonomy and naming Diuris protena was first formally described in 2006 by David Jones from a specimen collected in the Terrick Terrick National Park in 2004. The specific epithet (protena) is a Latin word meaning \\"before\\" or \\"forward\\", referring to the early flowering of this orchid. Distribution and habitat The orchid is known from sites in northern and north-western Victoria between Donald, Terrick Terrick and Elmore. It is found in remnants of Victoria‚Äôs native grassland and grassy woodland habitats. The largest population, of some 400 plants, was discovered at Bush Heritage Australia‚Äôs Nardoo Hills Reserves, 60 km south-west of Terrick Terrick, in yellow box woodland on the slopes of Mount Kerang. A likely pollinator of the orchid is a native bee that also pollinates bulbine lilies, similar in colour and size to the orchid, that are found in the same habitat. Conservation Almost all of the orchid‚Äôs habitat has been cleared for farming, with remaining sites threatened by weed infestation. In 2007 the population was estimated to comprise several hundred plants. The species is listed as endangered under Victoria‚Äôs Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988.

The first two of the four planned volumes were released in 1858 to largely unfavourable reviews. Though a few friends of Percy Shelley enjoyed the book, many critics attacked the book for being poorly edited and for portraying Shelley negatively. Though more volumes were planned, they were never published because of the Shelley family's objections to Hogg's treatment of him. Origin Portrait of Percy Bysshe Shelley in 1819 Hogg had previously published Shelley at Oxford in The New Monthly Magazine. This was a well-received account of the time they spent together at University College, Oxford. After he published this account, Mary Shelley suggested to him that he write a full biography of Percy Shelley. Hogg did not begin work on a biography for years, however, and Mary Shelley died before it was completed. He finally began the project after Percy Shelley's son Percy Florence Shelley also asked him to write a full account of his father's life. Hogg commenced work on the project in 1855. Unlike the previous article Hogg wrote, this book covered periods of Shelley's life that Hogg had only learned about secondhand. The Shelley family helped him by providing Percy Shelley's papers to him for use in his research. Percy Shelley's sisters Helen and Margaret also contributed accounts of childhood memories involving their brother. Hogg was known for the strength and clarity of his memory, and was able to recall minor details from the time that he spent with Percy Shelley. The initial plan was to release a four-volume work and the first two volumes of the book were published in 1858 by Edward Moxon. The text of Shelley at Oxford was included in the work, and comprised roughly one sixth of the final document. Themes The book primarily discusses the activities and correspondence shared between Hogg and Shelley. It includes 44 letters that were exchanged between Hogg and Shelley in 1810 and 1811. The text of many of the letters was changed by Hogg before the book's publication. He made most of the changes to cover up his own youthful radicalism and his romantic pursuit of Percy's sister Elizabeth. The original text of many of the letters shows that Hogg was often unstable and relied on Percy Shelley for guidance. The changes that were made often misled future biographers, although Hogg did preserve the originals as well. Hogg did not express much admiration for Shelley's poetry in the book. Many readers inferred from his description of Shelley that Hogg viewed him as a lady's man who was often irresponsible. Another irritation to many was that Hogg often boasted about himself in the book. He attempted to present himself as a sober and serious friend to an often foolish Percy Shelley. The book contained many descriptions of Shelley breaking appointments, borrowing money that he could not repay, and fabricating odd stories. Hogg did not mention the atheism that he shared with Percy Shelley, fearing the effect that this disclosure could have on his reputation. He went to great lengths in the book to portray himself as conservative and loyal to the traditions of England. Hogg was careful not to divulge potentially embarrassing information about Shelley's living friends, however. He also failed to mention his own passion for Harriet Shelley, Percy Shelley's first wife. Harriet was portrayed very favourably in the book, although Hogg did discuss her preoccupation with suicide. Percy's father Timothy Shelley was portrayed very negatively, and the book characterized Percy Shelley as often disdainful towards his parents. Sketch of Thomas Jefferson Hogg in 1857 Reception Soon after it was released, the book was panned by critics. One of the frequently mentioned problems with the book was that it lacked the extensive editing that his previous article about Shelley had been given. Critics viewed his larger work as often digressive and full of tangents, and some lamented the significant amount of space that Hogg devoted to describing the meals that they ate together. Others pointed out that the book did not contain the novel insights about Shelley and his poetry that Shelley at Oxford had delivered. Shelley's family was surprised to read the depictions of the young Percy Shelley and some of the accounts greatly upset them. A few of Mary Shelley's friends and relatives believed that felt that the positive description of Harriet caused Mary to look bad for drawing Percy Shelley away from her. Leigh Hunt was particularly critical of the book, but some have suggested that his critical tone may have been because of his portrayal in the book. Edward John Trelawny, however, spoke very positively of the book. Thomas Love Peacock also enjoyed the book, but thought it should have been described as Hogg's autobiography. Some other commentators have noted that the book does portray Shelley as a very likeable person. After reading the first two volumes, the Shelley family asked Hogg to provide them with his next volumes for pre-release editing. Hogg declined, however, and they revoked the documents about Percy Shelley that they granted to him for his research. Though Hogg had already started writing a third volume, it is generally believed that he never completed the work. Some have speculated that a manuscript of the last two volumes was completed but never discovered.

There are also smaller gold initials on red and blue grounds, smaller gold initials with purple foliate pen flourishes and smaller blue initials with red foliate pen flourishes. Provenance The manuscript may have been made for John Litton (d.1326), whose arms appear on folios 47r and 55v. It was also owned by Theodore of Malinton, Baron of Wemme (d. 1408). An inscription on folio 117r notes his death on May 7, 1408. The manuscript was owned by the antiquary Lord William Howard (d. 1640), the younger son of Thomas Howard (d. 1572), 4th duke of Norfolk. William Howard probably first bound it with the De Lisle Psalter. The manuscript was bequeathed to his William Howard's nephew Thomas Howard (d. 1646), 2nd Earl of Arundel, 4th Earl of Surrey, and 1st Earl of Norfolk, and then inherited by Henry Howard (d. 1684), 6th duke of Norfolk who presented the volume, along with the other manuscripts in the Earl of Arundel's collection to the Royal Society in 1667. In 1883 the British Library purchased the Arundel manuscripts from the Royal Society. De Lisle Psalter Bound with the Howard Psalter is part of what was once the De Lisle Psalter (Arundel MS 83 II), consisting of a calendar and the Speculum theologiae, a collection of diagrams attributed to John of Metz, a 13th century Franciscan friar working in Paris. The illuminations have been attributed to the Madonna Master, named after the facing miniatures of the Virgin and the Crucifixion (ff. 131v-132r), who may also have been responsible for paintings on the oak sedilia at Westminster Abbey (1307‚Äì8).

The film was originally produced for CBS Network but due to its popularity, steamy scenes were expanded and the film was given a PG-13 rating and re- released on DVD as Raw Heat by Lion's Gate/Artisan Home Video in September 2003. The movie was shot on location in Malibu, California. Plot Therapist Tess Parker (JoBeth Williams) meets Paul Tomlinson (Pierce Brosnan), an English professor she's wacky over, and he's also a guy that is too good to be true. Her patient Carla (Virginia Madsen), comes to Tess to tell her about her former lover who wanted to marry her but needed some time after his wife's death, even though they started going out when he was still married. But after a year he left and never came back, only to tell her that he was with someone else. Tess tries to comfort Carla after she thought Carla was going to jump off the edge of a building. The descriptions Carla gives Tess of her former lover seem somewhat familiar, but not until the time Carla shows Tess book written by her former lover, that Tess realizes Carla is talking about Paul. Tess eventually confronts Paul about this and he says that he knew her as a librarian, and the time Tess saw him hug her was to thank her for getting a 'hard to find' book for him. He says he had no relationship with her at all except sending her flowers to thank her for all her help with the book, and that he was not sleeping with her. Tess, believes him and they have a lovely, little snog. Carla shouts at Tess and drives away. Paul tells Carla to let her go. The next day, Tess goes to Carla's apartment, finding the door open and Carla gone. Tess searches Carla's apartment finding an explicit love letter to Carla signed by Paul, which she takes. In the morning she is confronted at home by Carla who warns Tess that Paul killed his wife, and that he'd kill again. Tess asks Paul about the letter and he says it is a missing letter he wrote to his wife. Tess asks Paul how his wife died, and Paul says she died in a hiking accident in the mountains. They had just had an argument and he went back to the cabin, so he wasn't there. The rangers said it looked like she slipped. Tess tell Paul that Carla said he killed his wife. He said they weren't the perfect couple by any means, but he loved her. They go to Carla's place and find it in disarray, with blood in the kitchen. Paul send Tess away, while he calls the police. At Paul's place, while he is showering, Tess is locked in a room with a burning chair. After Paul rescues Tess, the police find and question Carla, but lacking evidence they release her. Tess and Paul go to Paul's mountain cabin where it is snowing there. Paul puts a ring on her finger. It is the same ring as Carla said Paul had made especially for her. This was enough to start Tess believing that it is Paul who is lying, and that it is Carla all along who spoke the truth. While Paul is in another room, Tess sneaks out of the cabin, running into Carla who says she came to save Tess, and that they would have escape on foot because the roads were covered with ice. When Paul realises Tess is gone, he goes in search of her, following the footprints in the snow. When Paul catches up to Tess and Carla there is a confrontation, in which it is revealed the ring Carla has from Paul is actually the ring worn by Paul's deceased wife. The only way for Carla to have it, is for Carla to have taken it from her when Carla killed her. There is a fight in which Carla falls to her death. The next day Paul and Tess are leaving the mountain cabin. Tess gets into the car first, and looking for a map, she finds two identical rings, the same as she had been given from Paul and the same as his wife had been given from him. We see her shocked. The film ends with the camera zooming out on Paul getting into the car.

Established in 1977 by Paul Wisby in O'Bryonville as a bar, the Blue Wisp quickly became well known for its jazz music. Marjean Wisby continued the club's tradition after her husband's death in 1984, later moving the club to the basement space at 19 Garfield Place, to a location on East 8th street as of in 2002, and to 700 Race St. in 2012. The venue hosted the best local, national and international jazz for Cincinnati, and from the late 1970s to the early 2000s was considered the premier jazz venue in Cincinnati. The famous Blue Wisp neon sign was a signature of the venue. The marquee was once much larger and displayed the acts until city ordinance demanded the size be reduced. Marjean Wisby died of respiratory failure in 2006, leaving behind debts the estate could not pay. The club was sold and the new owners were not able to maintain the venue's appeal or its concept.

The book was released on January 10, 2012 by Grand Central Publishing. The book centers around Gideon Crew and is a sequel to Gideon's Sword. The plot focuses on a nuclear scare, the federal reaction, and Gideon's attempts to unravel the mystery. Synopsis The book begins immediately after the conclusion of Gideon's Sword. Eli Glinn does not seem displeased by Gideon's previous actions, and recruits Gideon to help calm down a colleague of Gideon's at Los Alamos National Laboratory, Reed Chalker, who has gone insane and has taken a family hostage. Chalker is spouting ravings that he has been irradiated by some conspiracy. In an event similar to the death of Gideon's father, Chalker is gunned down. During a search of his apartment, it is discovered that he is highly radioactive. It is determined that the cause of this was a botched attempt at assembling a dirty bomb. Chalker's hideout seems to have most of the tools necessary to create a nuclear bomb. It also has a map of DC, and a calendar indicating the bomb will detonate in ten day's time. Glinn assigns Gideon to help track down the bomb, and Gideon works with an FBI Agent named Stone Fordyce. The pair of them go out west to Los Alamos, and try to check into Chalker's past. They interview Reed's ex-wife, now a member of a radical cult, his favorite novelist, Simon Blaine, and the members of Chalker's mosque. On their way to Chalker's writers workshop in California, the plane Fordyce is flying suffers a malfunction in both engines, forcing them to crashland. Fordyce comments how unlikely this is to happen by accident, and concludes it was the result of sabotage. Gideon is framed for being a terrorist- incriminating emails are placed on his work computer, and he is forced into hiding. His reluctant accomplice in this is Alida Blaine, Simon's daughter. Gideon eventually comes to the conclusion that Simon is in on the conspiracy. Fordyce, convinced that Bill Novak‚Äîthe Los Alamos Security Director‚Äîis corrupt, assists Gideon in breaking into Simon's computer as the two of them drive to DC. They discover that Blaine's true plan is to steal a vial of smallpox, with most of the security busy searching for an imaginary bomb. Gideon manages to save the vial, but Fordyce dies in the process, and Alida is horribly distraught. Gideon then confirms that he has only a year to live, as Glinn mentioned in the first book. Reception Reception for Gideon's Corpse was mixed to positive. Kirkus Reviews wrote that the book was initially slow starting, but that the book eventually \\"zigzags like an out-of- control rocket toward a double-deceptive conclusion\\". Publishers Weekly panned Gideon's Corpse, saying that it fell \\"well short of the authors‚Äô usual high standard\\".

Background  Little is known about Wang Gong's early years, and it is not known when he was born. The first historical reference to him was in 887, when his father Wang Chongying was serving as the military governor of Shanguo Circuit (ÈôùËô¢, i.e., the same circuit that would later be known as Baoyi) and his uncle Wang Chongrong was serving as the military governor of Huguo Circuit (Ë≠∑Âúã, headquartered in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi), which lay across the Yellow River from Shanguo. That year, Wang Chongrong was assassinated by his officer Chang Xingru (). Shortly after the assassination, then-reigning Emperor Xizong made Wang Chongying the military governor of Huguo and Wang Gong the acting military governor of Shanguo, keeping both circuits in the hands of the Wang family.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 257.  As military governor of Baoyi  Wang Chongying died in 895. Wang Gong, who was referred to by that point as the military governor of Baoyi (as Shanguo had been renamed to Baoyi), coveted Huguo. However, the Huguo soldiers supported his cousin Wang Ke ‚Äî a biological son of his uncle Wang Chongjian () who had been adopted as a son by Wang Chongrong ‚Äî to succeed Wang Chongying. Both Wang Gong and his brother Wang Yao () the prefect of Jiang Prefecture (Áµ≥Â∑û, in modern Yuncheng) objected and attacked Wang Ke. They also wrote the major warlord Zhu Quanzhong the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (ÂÆ£Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan), claiming that Wang Ke was not actually biologically a member of the Wang family, while Wang Ke's father-in-law Li Keyong the military governor of Hedong Circuit (Ê≤≥Êù±, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi), who was the main rival to Zhu, supported Wang Ke.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 260. Then-reigning Emperor Zhaozong (Emperor Xizong's brother and successor) tried to send imperial eunuchs to mediate, but the mediation was not successful. Wang Gong and Wang Yao, unable to prevail over Wang Ke, then requested that Emperor Zhaozong send an alternative military governor for Huguo, and Emperor Zhaozong initially commissioned the chancellor Cui Yin to be the military governor of Huguo. However, at Li Keyong's insistence, Emperor Zhaozong then commissioned Wang Ke as military governor of Huguo. When Wang Gong subsequently sent gifts to and persuaded three other warlords ‚Äî Wang Xingyu the military governor of Jingnan Circuit (ÈùúÈõ£, headquartered in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi), Li Maozhen the military governor of Fengxiang Circuit (È≥≥Áøî, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi), and Han Jian the military governor of Zhenguo Circuit (ÈéÆÂúã, headquartered in modern Weinan, Shaanxi) ‚Äî to propose an alternative, that Wang Gong be given Huguo and Wang Ke be given Baoyi instead, Emperor Zhaozong rejected the proposal based on the fact that he had already granted Li Keyong's request. Subsequently, Wang Xingyu, Li Maozhen, and Han, embarrassed that their request was rejected, marched on to the capital Chang'an to threaten Emperor Zhaozong, and while they were there, they executed two former chancellors whom they perceived to be against them, Wei Zhaodu and Li Xi. Under duress, Emperor Zhaozong was forced to issue an edict making Wang Gong the military governor of Huguo, Wang Xingyu's brother Wang Xingyue () the military governor of Baoyi, and Wang Ke the military governor of Kuangguo Circuit (Âå°Âúã, also in modern Weinan, which Wang Xingyue had governed). The three warlords' actions drew a serious reaction from Li Keyong, who marched south from Hedong and prepared to attack them. When Li Keyong reached Jiang Prefecture, Wang Yao resisted him. Li Keyong quickly defeated and executed Wang Yao, and then marched on to the capital, eventually defeating Wang Xingyu, who fled but was killed in flight, and forcing Li Maozhen and Han into (temporary) submission to Emperor Zhaozong. In the aftermaths of this war, Wang Gong appeared to escape major repercussions, but was also unable to achieve his goal of taking over Huguo; rather, he remained at Baoyi. In 897, Wang Gong launched another attack on Huguo, and this time he had the assistance from Zhu's generals Zhang Cunjing () and Yang Shihou. They initially defeated Wang Ke just south of Yishi (ÁåóÊ∞è, in modern Yuncheng), but Li Keyong's nephew Li Sizhao then defeated them, forcing them to stop the siege against Huguo. In 898, Baoyi and Xuanwu forces against attacked Huguo, and Li Keyong again sent Li Sizhao to help Wang Ke repel the attack.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 261. Meanwhile, Wang Gong's rule of Baoyi was said to be violent, and imperial officials who went through Baoyi and who managed to offend him somehow where often arrested and killed.New Book of Tang, vol. 187. For example, in 898, when Emperor Zhaozong summoned the retired official Wang Zhu () to Chang'an, it was commonly speculated that Wang Zhu would next be made a chancellor. When Wang Zhu went through Baoyi on his way to Chang'an, Wang Gong initially accorded him great honor and wanted to meet him under ceremony that would make Wang Gong be like a son or nephew to him. When Wang Zhu refused, Wang Gong, in anger, killed Wang Zhu and his families and threw their bodies into the Yellow River, and then claimed to the imperial government that they had drowned when their ship capsized. The seriously weakened imperial government did not dare to investigate. By 899, it was said that Wang Gong had become so violent and paranoid that not even his wife and children could be secure that they could escape his wrath. Thereafter, he was killed in a mutiny, and the soldiers supported the officer Li Fan () to succeed him. Several months later, Li Fan was himself killed in a mutiny, and the officer Zhu Jian took over.

History =WVSU- AM= The origins of Crescent City Radio and student-run radio at Loyola University begin with WVSU-AM, meaning the Voice of the Student Union, broadcasting from the balcony in Marquette Theater of Marquette Hall around 1959 according to The Wolf (yearbook). The station was managed and operated by the Department of Communications as part of the student media group, Loyola Student Media, which today manages The Maroon, Wolf Magazine, and The Maroon Online. =WOLF-AM= At the end of the 1965-66 school year in Spring 1966, WVSU-AM changed its call letters to WOLF-AM to reflect the university's mascot, the Wolf Pack. The station moved to the basement of the Danna Student Center beneath the Orleans Room's kitchen. The station continued as an AM carrier-current station transmitting on 640 kHz. to all of Loyola University's and Dominican College's residential halls. =WLDC-AM= At the start of the 1968-69 school year in fall 1968, WOLF-AM changed its call letters to WLDC-AM naming it after the Loyola Department of Communications. The call letters were changed from orders of the Federal Communications Commission because a commercial station was using the WOLF-AM call letters. The station would broadcast within the residential halls at the campuses of Loyola University and Dominican College, currently Loyola's Broadway campus. WLDC-AM would become affiliated with the American Contemporary Radio Network and air ABC Contemporary News broadcasts five minutes before the hour, with sports and features. Local news was aired 25 minutes past the hour. During the late 1960s, the radio program \\"Pulse\\" aired from 9:00 p.m. to midnight on Sundays which included popular music and interviews on local and campus-wide news. On November 28, 1971, WLDC-AM returns on the air under the moniker \\"Renaissance Radio\\" with double its previous reception power and a new format that included Top 40, jazz, soul, progressive, and classical. News was previously taken from wire services, but with the relaunch, there were now four daily newscasts with on campus news and sports along with local news. All news content was gathered and written by station staff. The station also played throughout the Danna Center daily from 11:30 a.m. - 1:30 p.m. and from 4:30 p.m. - 6:00 p.m. In February 1972, Renaissance Radio WLDC-AM, began broadcasting evening re-runs of radio serials including The Adventures of Superman, The Weird Circle, The Shadow, Buck Rogers, The Strange Dr. Weird, The Whistler, and I Love a Mystery. Other programs that aired starting in 1972 were Howard Cosell and the WLDC interview program Sessions on Sundays at 9:00 p.m. In February 1972, WLDC-AM begins broadcasting to a third college in the New Orleans area, Xavier University of Louisiana for which the station began to play more music from black artists. WLDC-AM went the air in 1977. On February 4, 1980, WLDC-AM came back on the air. WLDC-AM aired a progressive radio format with news bulletins from ABC Radio Network's American Contemporary Network service from the American Information Network along with cultural news bulletins produced by WLDC-AM's news operation. In 1986, the university's new Communications/Music Complex is dedicated and WLDC-AM and WLDC-TV move to its new studios on the 4th floor. The entire floor is equipped with several professional studios for the television station, editing rooms, a newsroom, control rooms and recording booths for WLDC-AM. This would be the third place to house the radio station. By 1993, closed-circuit WLDC-TV Channel 8 was no longer broadcasting the audio of WLDC-AM and Marriott Corporation, which managed the Danna Center, did not allow for WLDC-AM to broadcast over its PA system. During the 1990s, student interest was drastically lower and the future was uncertain. In 1996, WLDC-AM, still under the School of Mass Communication, goes off the air for the final time. WLDC-AM throughout its existence continuously received criticism for its limited and poor quality reception. A listenable signal was available to only certain locations at Loyola University, notably in the dormitories, and it was criticized for its never being able to become a broadcast station through a license with the Federal Communications Commission which would have allowed for WLDC-AM to be heard within a broadcasting radius over the air instead of through carrier-current. Since Loyola also owned WWL-AM and FM until 1989, this would have run up against the fact that it was then against FCC regulations for one owner to have two or more broadcast radio stations on the same band in the same market. (This rule was subsequently rescinded; station owners in many markets now own several stations on both AM and FM bands.) Near the final demise of WLDC-AM, the lack of audience because of its limited transmission and its failed attempts to solicit a radio license because of an already crowded radio market in New Orleans caused a lack of interest between the student body and the communications department. =Crescent City Radio= In 2005, Loyola's Music Industry Studies program presented a proposal to the University Communications Committee to approve the creation of a college radio station at Loyola University New Orleans as an internet radio station. The following year, the approved proposal was given a final approval by the university president, Rev. Kevin Wildes, S.J. and Crescent City Radio went online in spring 2008, broadcasting from WLDC-AM's former studios in the Communications/Music Complex. Crescent City Radio, the new student-run commercial radio station, would not be part of Loyola Student Media or the School of Mass Communication, but rather the Music Industry Studies program in the College of Music and Fine Arts. =Loyola-operated stations= The following is a history of radio and television broadcasting assets of Loyola University New Orleans. =WWL= Crescent City Radio and broadcasting at Loyola University New Orleans has its origins with WWL by first broadcasting on 833 kc. in 1922 from Marquette Hall on Loyola University New Orleans's main campus. The station then changed frequencies to 1070 kc. in 1924, 1090 kc. in 1925, 1220 kc. in 1927, and then at 850 kc. in 1929 when a 5,000 watt transmitter was installed in Bobet Hall. The station became affiliated with the CBS Radio Network on November 1, 1935. In 1937, the station increased its transmission power to 50,000 watts. The station settled at 870 kc. in 1946. At this time, WWL broadcast from the Roosevelt Hotel in downtown New Orleans. WWL-TV On September 7, 1957, Loyola University New Orleans establishes WWL-TV, the fourth oldest television station in New Orleans, as the area's CBS affiliate. History of Television Operations from the university WWL-FM By 1960, the first WWL-FM by the university at 101.9 MHz began broadcasting a beautiful music radio format until the early 1970s from a transmitter in northern Kenner, Louisiana close to the shores of Lake Pontchartrain. WWL-FM would switch to a Top 40 radio format but revert to beautiful music by May 1976. On December 26, 1980, WWL-FM became WAJY JOY 102 and then became KLMG Magic 102, both airing an adult contemporary radio format. By 1995, KLMG now owned by Entercom Communications, would rebrand itself as Magic 101.9. WWL-FM currently also owned by Entercom Communications would return to the airwaves at 105.3 MHz in April 2006 simulcasting WWL's signal after previously doing so on August 29, 2005 when then WKZN's transmitter was damaged because of Hurricane Katrina. Shortly after the storm, the station switched to WKBU as Bayou 105.3 airing a classic rock radio format. In October 2005, both WKBU and WTKL Kool 95.7 would swap frequencies. WKBU would change from transmitting from Kenner to New Orleans and 105.3 MHz would become WTKL Kool 105.3. Then in April 2006, WTKL was moved to an Internet webcast and WWL-FM would return to the airwaves on 105.3 MHz simulcasting WWL's signal in an effort to increase listenership within office buildings or other places where AM broadcasting could not penetrate. Shortly after, The Delta a blues radio format would begin to broadcast on 105.3 HD-2. KATC-TV During the 1970s, Loyola University New Orleans owned KATC-TV in Lafayette, Louisiana as the area's ABC affiliate and WWL-TV's sister station. News operation Crescent City Radio does not run a news operation and focuses on airing music content. Any news content is independently created by individual shows at their discretion. In agreement with Loyola Student Media, podcasts from The Maroon, Loyola University New Orleans's weekly newspaper aired several times a day with The Maroon's latest print headlines and updated weekly. The recordings were available as podcasts on The Maroon Online. Podcasting from each section in The Maroon began on Monday, November 27, 2006 for distribution only on The Maroon Online. Eventually, a single weekly podcast was produced by The Maroon's webmaster and aired on Crescent City Radio during the entire week. The podcast consisted of readings from several sections of the latest Maroon. As of May 2010, The Maroon stopped recording podcasts. Previously when the station was WLDC-AM and part of Loyola Student Media and the School of Mass Communication, the station ran a news department in which regular local news bulletins were written and aired by news staff. When the station began using the WLDC-AM call letters, the station was affiliated to ABC Radio‚Äôs American Contemporary Network for news bulletins, newscasts, and content. From about 1969-70, a radio program called \\"Pulse\\" aired on WLDC-AM that included current hit music along with interviews and discussions relating current campus news stories and issues along with news reports from ABC News Radio. Television operations =Television studios= Studio C in the Communications/Music Complex at the university, along with Crescent City Radio are managed by the Music Industry Studies Program from the College of Music and Fine Arts. \\"Pack News\\" from Loyola Student Media shoots its weekly news updates in this studio. The Music Industry Studies Program also shoots interviews, in-studio sessions, and holds classes in the studio. University public affairs also uses the studio for interviews. Pack News \\"Pack News\\" is an online video-based news service produced by the university's student charter of the RTDNA and hosted by Loyola Student Media, shoots its weekly news updates with entertainment and commentary in Studio C. \\"Pack News\\" is hosted on Loyola Student Media's web site, The Maroon Online and on YouTube. \\"Pack News\\" has returned the production of video-based news to the university since the broadcasting program was eliminated in 2007 with university-wide Pathways elimination plan. The \\"Pack News\\" newsroom is also a classroom computer-lab across the hall from Studio C is also the former newsroom for WLDC-TV. Music News In 2010 to 2011, the Music Industry Studies Program taped \\"Music News\\", a news update on the music industry in Studio C. The news update was previously called \\"Loyola Music News\\" and also produced an update in Spanish under the same title. =History of Loyola-operated stations= Stations that were assets of Loyola University New Orleans. =WWL-TV= Before 1989, when WWL was owned by Loyola University New Orleans, the university operated WWL-TV Channel 4 beginning on September 7, 1957 from the current Rampart Street studios, previously a 7-Up bottling plant in the French Quarter. After 1989, channel 4 was run by Rampart Broadcasting until it was sold to Belo Corp in 1994. =KATC-TV= During the 1970s, KATC-TV, Channel 3 in Lafayette, Louisiana was owned by Loyola University New Orleans and was WWL-TV's sister station. Previously, the station was owned by the Acadian Television Company since the station first launched on September 19, 1962. In 1984, the university sold the station to Merrill Lynch. Channel 3 was then sold in 1998 to Cordillera Communications, the television unit of the Evening Post Publishing Company. =History of Loyola internal stations= Stations that were once operated by the School of Mass Communication of Loyola University New Orleans and aired for within the university. =WLDC-TV Channel 2 and 8= WLDC-TV began broadcasting from its studios in the basement of the Danna Student Center beneath the kitchen of the Orleans Room dining room, as part of the Loyola Student Media cluster in the School of Mass Communication. Therefore, the call letters are named after the \\"Loyola Department of Communications\\". Broadcasting began on March 26, 1973 at noon broadcasting a 15-minute newscast only to five monitors on channel 2 in the Danna Center dining hall known as the A la Carte, with an additional monitor added later to the contract dining hall, also known as the Orleans and St. Charles Rooms respectively through closed-circuit television. Programming began airing Monday through Friday from 12:00 p.m. - 12:30 p.m. The creation of the television station was part of the originals aims of the communications department since it was established in the spring of 1967. The station manager for WLDC-TV and AM was Mike Hadley. On the following semester on October 22, 1973 at 10:30 a.m., the station signed on again and could be watched on closed-circuit television in the Danna Center. The channel began broadcasting only on weekdays from 10:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. Daily programming began with a 15-minute preview followed by Star Trek at 10:45 a.m. followed by 15 minutes of news analysis and commentary. On Mondays, a sports update would air covering local college and Loyola games. On Tuesdays, the \\"Music and Drama Show\\" would air with cultural and entertainment news along with student performances. Student Government Association activities would air on Thursdays. The news analysis show, \\"Take Two\\" would air on the last 15 minutes of every broadcasting day. The station's news operation covered campus and local news with national and international news from the Associated Press. The founding faculty advisor was Norman C. Stein, an assistant professor of communications at the time. At its founding, between 50 and 75 students accounted for the production of content on WLDC-TV. Throughout the station's history, channel would focus on producing news content. Like The Maroon, the university weekly newspaper, WLDC-TV produced a weekly newscast that would air within the university on closed-circuit cable channel 2. In 1986, WLDC-AM and WLDC-TV moved to their new studios in the Communication/Music Complex on the fourth floor with several professional television studios for WLDC-TV, a newsroom, control rooms, and recording booths, for WLDC-AM. In 1996, WLDC-AM goes off the air due to lack of interest and funding, while in 2006, institutional eliminations in the Pathways program eliminated the broadcast sequences from the School of Mass Communication and thus ending WLDC-TV in 2007. Pathways eliminations WLDC-TV and the broadcasting sequence from the School of Mass Communication were eliminated along with the broadcasting faculty during the Pathways program after Hurricane Katrina in 2005 when the university cut funding for many programs and fired faculty, many before their tenure, due to the university's assumption that enrollment would go down after Hurricane Katrina, which displaced students for half an academic year. Many former faculty sued the university. In June 2011, the American Association of University Professors officially removed the university from its censure list after a solicitation from the university's chapter in May 2011. =LSCN Channel 8= In Fall 2006, campus-wide (except Broadway Campus) television channel LSCN Channel 8, would then become operated by the Office of Residential Life, replacing WLDC-TV as a 24-hour movie channel, airing pre- selected movies and educational material which broadcast from the Danna Student Center basement. The same package of movies would air for an entire month and replaced the following month with a new line-up of movies. It was typical for the Office of Residential Life to send out polls via e-mail to all its residents in all dormitories (except Cabra Hall) asking which movies should air the following month. LSCN Channel 8 went dark in 2010. =MtvU= As of Fall 2012, MtvU began broadcasting its national feed on the campus-wide television channel 8. The Office of Residential Life, under the Office of Co- Curricular Activities of Loyola University New Orleans had signed a contract with Viacom since the start of 2012 in order to receive and broadcast MtvU's signal. Channel 8 is operated by the Office of Co-Curricular for the use of the Office of Residential Life. Programing Programs are produced at Crescent City Radio and most are broadcast live. Primetime during the week consists mostly of urban formatted music programs. Music rotations with different genres air every hour between shows. Most programming hours are aired in English with some programming only in Spanish. Some programs may change air day and time every four months (three times) in a year. Talent and program directors do not need to be affiliated with Loyola University New Orleans and are free to decide the content of their programming. =Musical influences= As a Freeform radio station, Crescent City Radio airs programs that range from Urban radio formats like urban contemporary, mainstream urban, and gospel, varying adult contemporary radio formats, several New Orleans music genres, and specific Louisiana roots music and dance southern region genres like swamp pop. Other radio formats that air on programs include, Latin Top 40 pop, Rock en Espa√±ol, K-pop, and J-pop. Music rotations air classical, reggae, and unsolicited music submissions from artists. =Station image= Crescent City Radio identifies itself with the Crescent City of New Orleans, hence the station's name. Stingers aired on the station include, \\"You're rolling down the river with Crescent City Radio dot com\\", which is related to the Mississippi River, which runs through New Orleans, \\"Get your fill of musical gumbo on Crescent City Radio dot com\\" relates to Louisiana's typical stew of gumbo, and another stinger aired is, \\"You're listening to Crescent City Radio, its music for your mind\\", which includes the station's motto. In Spanish, the station's stinger is \\"Estas escuchando Crescent City Radio, es m√∫sica para tus o√≠dos\\". The station's motto, \\"Music for your mind\\" could possibly relate to the station's Freeform format. =Live performance= With a bi-directional audio link with the nearby recording studio facilities, the station is able to feature high quality live performances. Musical acts frequently perform live, on the air and are recorded by station and university staff by using a digital audio workstation software, a multi-channel recording format. Recordings are provided to the artists for use as demo recordings or for archival purposes. The radio station has a public lounge area overlooking St. Charles Avenue where visitors may see on-air talent live inside the studio through a soundproof glass barrier. Speakers were once in the lounge which allowed visitors to experience the station as it aired live worldwide. The speakers were removed under the decision by the station Ààs faculty advisor. Personnel Although, the station's faculty advisor must be affiliated with the university as a faculty member, Crescent City Radio allows all positions to be held by members of the general public. =Notable former station staff= * LeBron \\"LBJ\\" Joseph - on-air personality (1980; now at WGNO-TV as co-anchor of News with a Twist and co-host on The Hometeam Morning Show on KMEZ 106.7) * Mike Ross - general manager (1979 - 1980; now at KTUU-TV as anchor and managing editor) References  External links  Media Industry Studies - College of Music and Fine Arts - Loyola University New Orleans College radio stations in Louisiana Spanish-language radio stations in Louisiana Internet radio stations in the United States Radio stations established in 1959 Loyola University New Orleans Freeform radio stations 1959 establishments in Louisiana ","title":"Crescent City Radio"},{"id":"31269497","text":"Luk√°≈° Dlouh√Ω and Leander Paes were the defending champions, but chose not to participate together.

It was directed by Paul Vernon and Clive Bowden.  Plot  Simon Kelly who on visiting the Isle of Wight, meets Rachel Burton, someone he briefly knew many years before. When he approaches her, she claims not to remember him. He asks her if she is Rachel Burton, and she confirms she is. Later, when he tells Phil Harrison, he also remembers the name. When Phil, who owns a local newspaper, looks up Rachel on various databases, he finds that she actually died in 1986. The film starts just before a party in the summer of 1984, in a country lane, where a drug dealer is preparing to set off for a village hall party. At the party, Simon Kelly meets Rachel Burton, who has only gone to the party to buy drugs, and ends up back at her house. During the course of their conversations, Rachel tells him she will be dead by the time she's 25, adding that she believes life is pointless. After spending the night with her, Simon meets one of his friends from the party, who laughs when he finds out where Simon has been. Simon then throws Rachel's telephone number into the sea. The film then cuts to the present day. Phil Harrison arrives to visit Simon, and finds him hungover and surrounded by empty wine bottles and lager cans. Simon tells him about his visit to the Isle of Wight, and his meeting with Rachel Burton. When Phil realizes Rachel Burton died in 1986, this raises the question, how did Simon have a conversation with someone who's dead ? Phil doesn't believe in anything that isn't tangible, but one of his employees at the newspaper runs a sideline publication called Actual Reality, which features interviews with people who claim to have accidentally found doors through time. Phil tells Simon of a charity dinner he‚Äôd been to with his employee, Chris Hampton, and the argument he‚Äôd witnessed between Chris and a vicar who had strongly discouraged Chris from taking any further interest in the suggestion of the existence of time doors. The argument had almost developed into a fight, as the vicar told him not to interfere with things he knew nothing about, and that if he did, no good would come of it. The film raises as many questions as it answers as Phil gets Simon to describe his daytrip in detail. Through this they work out that Simon must have accidentally gone back in time before he met Rachel, and he must also have come back to the present day before he came home. Simon has told Phil he climbed over the wall from a church yard into a park, as a shortcut, and that he took the same route later when he came back. Phil is convinced this must be where the time door is, on the basis that it is the only place he passed once in each direction. Phil does some more research and finds out Rachel Burton had committed suicide in 1986 due to depression, after the death of her mother in a car accident. Simon admits he feels partly to blame because he feels that he used Rachel, and never went back to see her again. Phil comments that they are both probably to blame and confesses that it was he who sold her the drugs at the party where Simon met her. They know from Phil‚Äôs research, the date of the accident in which Rachel‚Äôs mother died, and go back to 1984 on the night before it is due to happen. They set fire to her mother‚Äôs car so she cannot drive it and have the accident. The film concludes when a week later, Phil takes Simon to the railway station and Rachel Burton walks by. Phil, who has an up-to-date photograph of her, ushers Simon in her direction, they have a conversation and this time she remembers him. As they are sitting in Phil‚Äôs car afterwards, watching the Isle of Wight ferry leave Portsmouth, Simon says he‚Äôs barely able to believe the events of the last week. Phil then reveals that the reason Rachel recognized Simon is that the day after the car fire, he had returned to the island on his own, and visited Rachel Burton‚Äôs home, to check if her mother was still alive. As an optional extra he had told Rachel to meet him in a caf√© in Ryde on the following Saturday. Obviously he had failed to show up as he‚Äôd gone back to his own time by then. But he knew Simon had gone over there on that date as it was his birthday, and he‚Äôd told Phil which caf√© he had been in.

Welwyn Garden City, anxious to develop the town with home industries, had initially approached A.E Bundy, who had bought British Instructional Films, from Sir Oswald Stoll. Bundy was offered the site on favourable terms and thousands of girders left over after Stoll had enlarged his Surbiton Studios, further reduced the construction cost. H. Bruce Woolfe, producer of significant First World War documentaries, was the major figure at the studios. Welwyn was one of the pioneer studios in Britain - it produced one of the first British sound films, claimed to use the first back-projection shot - in Battles of the Coronel and Falkland Islands - , and was important in the production of British educational films. Woolfe made the popular Secrets of Nature series and war films, the afore-mentioned Battles of the Coronel and Falkland Islands and Tell England. Tell England, a story concerned with the Gallipoli landings, was directed by Anthony Asquith for British Instructional Films, and he was an artist who had been given his first chance at Welwyn studios. Later films made at Welwyn included The Night Has Eyes (1942) with James Mason, Queen of Spades (1949), Quiet Weekend (1946), and Cairo Road (1950), with Eric Portman, No Place For Jennifer (1950) with Leo Genn. The studios were apparently not ideal for talkies and noises easily penetrated and made shooting difficult - the 5pm hooter from the nearby Nabisco Shredded wheat factory and the adjacent main-line railway were amongst the distractions. Of the 194 employees in 1950, 46 transferred to Associated British Picture Corporation's studios at Elstree.Picturegoer, October 21, 1950 pp.8-9 The three-studio complex was sold in 1951 to a tobacco company.

Biography George E. Roberts was born in Colesburg, Iowa on August 19, 1857, the son of David and Mary (Harvey) Roberts.Profile from Biographical Dictionary of Iowa He was raised in Dubuque County, Iowa, Manchester, Iowa, and Fort Dodge, Iowa. At age, Roberts began a career in the newspaper industry by working as a printer's apprentice at the Fort Dodge Times, and later the Fort Dodge Messenger. He was briefly city editor of the Sioux City Journal. In 1878, he purchased the Fort Dodge Messenger and served as its editor. Roberts was active in the Republican Party of Iowa and, in 1883, was elected State Printer of Iowa, holding this office until 1889. In 1902, he and a partner purchased the Iowa State Register and the Des Moines Leader, which they merged to form the Des Moines Register and Leader. As a newspaper editor, Roberts was particularly interested in economic and monetary policy. He was an opponent of free silver. In 1894, he published a response to William Hope Harvey's Coin's Financial School (1893), entitled Coin at School in Finance. He followed this up with Money, Wages and Prices (1895) and Iowa and the Silver Question (1896). Both of these works were important parts of the campaign that defeated William Jennings Bryan in the 1896 U.S. presidential election. In 1902, Roberts authored the Iowa Republican Party's platform on tariffs, which criticized protectionism and supported reciprocity. In 1898, United States Secretary of the Treasury Lyman J. Gage recommended that President of the United States William McKinley appoint Roberts Director of the United States Mint, and Roberts held that office from February 1898 to July 1907. He then became president of the Commercial National Bank in Chicago. In 1910, President William Howard Taft appointed Roberts to a third term as Director of the U.S. Mint, with Roberts holding office from July 1910 to November 1914. Upon leaving government service in 1914, Roberts became assistant to the president of the National City Bank in New York City. In 1916 he was elected as a Fellow of the American Statistical Association.List of ASA Fellows, retrieved 2016-07-16. He became a vice president of the bank in 1919, a position he held until 1931, when he became one of the bank's economic advisers, a position he held until his death. From 1914 to 1940, Roberts edited the bank's Monthly Economic Letter, an investment bulletin dealing with world events, economic affairs, and national and international finances. In 1929, he headed a delegation of financiers to Panama to study that country's finances. He was a member of the Gold Delegation of the Financial Committee of the League of Nations from 1930 to 1932.

Barbosa was born in Ituverava, where he lived with his parents on a farm until 13 years old. He learned to read at the age of five, and had his secondary education at schools in Ribeir√£o Preto. Oct√°vio Barbosa graduated from the Universidade Federal de Ouro Preto (UFOP) in civil engineering and Mining. He worked in ancient Geological and Mineralogical Survey of Brazil (SGM), in the early 1930s, which in 1936 renamed itself the National Department of Mineral Production DNPM. He married Beatriz de Lima Vieira, on April 19, 1933 in Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil. His second wife, Vera Rita de Castro Dias, geographer, formed by the USP, collaborated on many of the geomorphological works. He has a son and four grandchildren. From his first marriage, until August 1954, had five children, 10 grandchildren and six great-grandchildren. At 1932, he joined the Polytechnic School of S√£o Paulo, where he taught for 16 years. With 48 years went to work for Prospec in Petropolis, where he developed consulting activities. In 1977, he joined the CPRM, currently Geological Survey of Brazil. It was a professional versatility. He has published over 200 scientific papers and trained hundreds of engineers and geologists. Oct√°vio Barbosa attended the first board of Brazilian Geological Society, serving as vice president alongside Luciano Jacques de Moraes. He made many works of field geology and mineral prospecting and had appreciation for the indigenous terms, which you also were useful in physiographic descriptions and interpretations in Brazil. Oct√°vio Barbosa was in the Geological Survey, for six years, research assistant to Luciano Jacques de Moraes, with whom he published some works in co-authorship. Very young, he was appointed Director of Current Development Division of Mineral Production, where he remained until 1940. In those years he studied the phonolite of Lages, Santa Catarina (1933) described the rocks and geology of the former Federal District, covering the Rio de Janeiro. Studied deposits of nickel (1935), iron (especially in Santa Catarina) and manganese, and devoted some time to studies on groundwater, particularly in Minas Gerais (1938‚Äì1940), was also interested by the pre- Devonian formations ( 1936). Published in 1938, work on deposits of aquamarine, bismuth and tantalum. Wrote about gold in general, and particularly on the Gold Caet√© (1939) and outlined preliminary ideas about the geology of the Reconcavo Baiano, also in 1939. In 1938 he criticized, in a famous controversy in the Brazilian Academy of Sciences, the theory of protognaisse \\"Alberto Ribeiro Lamego. His versatility and his scientific curiosity, excited by the issues of greatest interest to Brazil, are witnessed by publication of the decade running from 1930 to 1940. In 1940 published a work on hygiene of mines that forerun the Environmental Geology, indicates unfavorable conditions prevailing at the Morro Velho Mine, anticipating the current concepts. That same year he studied the glacial striations of Permo- Carboniferous Paran√° Basin. In 1940 he was invited to occupy the Chair of geology of Polytechnic School of USP. He stayed 16 years as a Professor in this University. Published in 1949, co-authored with his assistant, Fernando Fl√°vio Marques de Almeida, work on the Tubar√£o and Ribeira. Studied, from 1941 to 1943, the mine magnesite of Serra das √âguas, in the Bahia. He was a consultant Perus Cement Factory, where he supervised the mining of limestone, clay, and also of magnesite. In 1953 he specialized in granitization. In 1954 he wrote a note on geology for tunnels and dams. In 1956 he left the Polytechnic School of S√£o Paulo and was hired as a consultant for the company Prospec in Petr√≥polis. Then had the opportunity to attend various congresses and symposia, national and international. Participated in various projects of geological mapping and economic geology. The first work in which he engaged was the \\"Project Araguaia\\" photogeological survey, between the rivers Tocantins, Araguaia and Xingu. The literature reports studies on the coal basin of the Tocantins and descriptions of volcanic events in Brazil, Peru and Mexico (both 1957). That same year he published an essay on the chimney alkaline and carbonatite. His interest in this subject comes from 1934 and 1936, commented on the chimney of Po√ßos de Caldas (and also in 1948). He published several papers on geomorphology, which is in the field, one of their first looks. The versatility of curious Oct√°vio Barbosa is that, from 1952 to 1958, he published some work on paleobotany, setting the age of Gondwana floras and weaving observations (in 1957) on theParatoxopitys Americana, a fossil wood of Irati Formation. Had the opportunity to spend some time on his passion: the diamonds. Since 1938, when he studied the diamond \\"Minas Gerais\\", by Coromandel, it remained latent interest to academics, studying, still in Prospec, diamonds in western Minas Gerais. In 1977, after 21 years of stay in Prospec, has joined the cadre of the CPRM, where it remained, as consultant. He made geological surveys and mineral registry panel to the west of S√£o Francisco River and eastern Tocantins River. Surveys conducted in Goi√°s Minas Gerais and current Distrito Federal. Studied the tin ores of Rio Palma and the nickel Barro Alto, where calculating 120 million tons of ore weathering. Studied deposits of gold in the basin of the Ribeira south of S√£o Paulo. He researched the covers of the Brazilian Northeast. In recent years engaged in research in platinum in the states of Pernambuco Bahia, S√£o Paulo Resources and Goi√°s. Oct√°vio Barbosa received numerous accolades, awards and honors. In 1974 he received the Medal of Merit Mineral. The Brazilian Geological Society (SBG) in 1968, awarded him the highest honor of geologists from Brazil, the Gold Medal \\"Jos√© Bonif√°cio. Brazilian Geological Society - List Gold Medal \\"Jose Bonifacio\\"\\" He stated several times that the professional to feel happy to follow their desires and meet up with their aspirations and their work. Feeling comfortable in improvisations Mandatory field work and having used all means of transport that can be imagined as jeep, airplane, little planes, helicopter, mule, truck, boat and how many types of locomotion may exist, Oct√°vio Barbosa always preached to the young:'Love life of the field and like to travel, by any possible means of locomotion'. His love of geology made him declare often that will live with a hammer in his hand until the last day of his life. \\" Much remains to be done, geology and mining in Brazil. Although the current labor market and demand for services to geology are still very scarce, I believe (says Oct√°vio Barbosa) that this situation will change because in large countries such as South Africa, Canada, the United States, Russia and others, where the geology was well developed, still discover new things. In spite of all that is known, is a world to discover . The Amazon, for example, which is unknown, is a true Canadian. Therefore, I believe there will, therefore, an incentive for the present, even the new geologists, come here to toil in their specialties\\"' \\"‚Äì Oct√°vio Barbosa. Oct√°vio Barbosa died on January 31, 1997 in Petr√≥polis, RJ. He left a vast legacy of geological knowledge recorded in hundreds of papers published as reports, books and journal articles which are incorporated in the Library of CPRM, Geological Survey of Brazil in Rio de Janeiro. The Library was named Library Oct√°vio Barbosa whose works are available for free access. It incorporates a specialized collection in Geosciences, listing papers, books, national and international journals, and technical reports, maps, aerial photographs and various photocartographic documents that are available to the community.

It documents the story of Kamila Sidiqi, a young female entrepreneur working during the years of Taliban rule in Afghanistan, a time when the rights of women were severely restricted. Dressmaker is the first book by Lemmon, who serves as deputy director of the Council on Foreign Relations' Women and Foreign Policy program. Her work has appeared in the New York Times, the Financial Times, and The Christian Science Monitor, amongst other publications. The Dressmaker of Khair Khana is a New York Times Bestseller. The book was edited by Julia Cheiffetz and was acquired by Lisa Sharkey.  Origins  In the winter of 2005, Lemmon traveled to Afghanistan as part of a case study she was completing for her MBA at Harvard University. She was studying women entrepreneurs, particularly those in conflict zones. She sought to change the narrative from ‚Äúvictim‚Äù to ‚Äúsurvivor.‚Äù Given the tone of caution in Afghanistan, it was at first difficult to locate a viable subject. However, a contact referred Lemmon to Kamila Sidiqi and her family. Lemmon met with them and their associates over several subsequent trips to Afghanistan.  Plot summary  The story begins in 1996 on the day that Kamila graduates with her teaching certificate, and the day the Taliban first arrive in Kabul, capital of Afghanistan and home to the Sidiqi family. Inspired by the sharia law of Islam, it would become the doctrine of the Taliban to completely isolate women from society. Women were not permitted to work, attend school, or even leave the house without a male relative, or mahram. Kamila‚Äôs father and brothers do not escape persecution either, and are soon forced to flee the city. Unable to teach and desperate to support her family, Kamila masters the art of dressmaking and passes on the skills to her younger sisters. In order to find work for the budding business, Kamila frequently makes the dangerous trek to the market and meets with the owners of local dress shops. Soon the business is growing, and Kamila sees an opportunity to help other women in her community. With the help of her sisters, she opens a tailoring school in their home to teach women how to sew and to give them work once they completed their training. At a time of almost insurmountable poverty, she is able to employ nearly one hundred of her friends and neighbors, all the while escaping the scrutiny of the Taliban. Critical reception The Dressmaker of Khair Khana has been reviewed by magazines, journals, and blogs including the Huffington Post, Christian Science Monitor, and the Los Angeles Times. People Magazine has called Dressmaker \\"a fascinating window on Afghan life under the Taliban and a celebration of women the world over who support their loved ones with tenacity, inventiveness, and sheer guts.\\" The Huffington Post noted, \\"The Dressmaker of Khair Khana is a book to be shared across genders and generations, a truly uplifting and very true story of how one woman set out to start a business and ended up preserving the dignity of so many women.\\" Angelina Jolie, Greg Mortenson, Mohamed El-Erian, and Daily Beast Editor-in- Chief Tina Brown wrote the reviews for Dressmaker's book sleeve.

Kellyville Station opened 26 May 2019.Sydney Metro City & Southwest Project Overview Sydney Metro June 2015  History  Kellyville, on Sydney's rural fringes, was not considered suitable for new suburban development until 1988, when then Planning Minister Bob Carr abandoned the state's long-standing policy of concentrating new development along existing rail corridors. Instead, the government green-lit development in the area on the proviso that a corridor be preserved for mass transit to be built in future. This corridor, which runs beside Old Windsor Road, was announced as the alignment for the North West T-way, a new bus rapid transit line 10 years later and construction began in 2004. Kellyville's three T-way stations ‚Äì known as Riley, Burns and Balmoral ‚Äì opened in March 2007, providing commuters with fast bus access from Kellyville to the Parramatta CBD.

A Burns Road Station remained government policy even when the NWRL was dumped in favour of the North West Metro proposal in 2008. The 2009 version of plan featured two stations, one at Burns Road, called Kellyville, and a second at Samantha Riley Drive.  Design and construction  The Australian Labor Party was heavily defeated at the 2011 state election in part because of its tendency to announce, cancel and re-announce transport projects. The incoming Liberal/Nationals government, led by Barry O'Farrell, had put a promise to build the NWRL at the centre of their election platform. During consultation and detailed design, it was decided that Burns Road would be replaced with two stations: , on the edge of the giant Norwest Business Park, and Kellyville. Kellyville Station would be built on a new railway viaduct (dubbed the \\"skytrain\\") above the existing Riley T-way station. As part of the project's public‚Äìprivate partnership delivery model, a consortium was chosen to operate the stations and trains. To ensure that the stations were designed to be maintainable and with customer service in mind, the operator would also be responsible for designing and building the station buildings. (An Italian joint venture, Impregilo-Salini, was chosen to build the viaduct as part of a separate $340 million contract.)

Closure The Innes Siding to Morganville section closed on 1 November 1960 and from Wallaville to Innes closed on 1 May 1964. It must be assumed that they were not viable. The remaining section from Goondoon to Wallaville closed from 15 June 1964. It was sold to the Wallaville sugar mill, which converted the majority to a two foot gauge sugar cane tramway.

She received the section patrol number SP-130 during World War I. The troopship was the former German ocean liner Amerika. She was assigned the U.S. Navy ID number 3006 during World War I. A Section Patrol Craft was a civilian vessel registered by the United States Navy for potential wartime service before, during, and shortly after World War I. The SP/ID registration system In 1916, with World War I raging abroad, the U.S. Navy began a registry of privately owned pleasure craft and yachts that were available for patrol service in the event the United States was drawn into the conflict, which it eventually entered on 6 April 1917. \\"Section Patrol\\" (\\"SP\\") numbers were assigned in a series beginning with SP-1 and ultimately extending to well over 4000. As the registration process continued, other types of ships and craft (such as cargo ships, tankers, and passenger ships) were included which were not suited or intended for patrol duty and for which the \\"Section Patrol\\" designation was clearly inappropriate, and these were generally given \\"Identification\\" (\\"ID\\") numbers in the same series as the \\"SP\\" numbers. In addition, some vessels that were numbered with an \\"SP\\" prefix before 1918 later had that prefix changed to \\"ID\\". Many of the ships and craft assigned SP or ID numbers had no Navy service, while others that were acquired and employed by the Navy received no numbers. The registry, and the SP/ID number series, was continued at least into the early 1920s, with new numbers being assigned to ships completed or examined after World War I ended on 11 November 1918. The latter category included some ships that served in the Navy without SP or ID numbers between 1917 and 1919. SP/ID numbers and U.S. Navy hull numbers The SP and ID registry numbers were not U.S. Navy \\"hull numbers,\\" which would not be formally adopted until 17 July 1920. However, like hull numbers, the SP and ID numbers were used for record-keeping purposes and were often painted on the exterior of vessels (especially patrol types) to facilitate identification. They can therefore be considered precursors of the U.S. Navy hull number system instituted in July 1920 and still in use today.

Education and career Born in Trinidad, Pawan was educated at Saint Mary's College in Port of Spain and won an Island Scholarship in 1907. He then went on to the University of Edinburgh, where he graduated in 1912 with bachelor's degrees in medicine and surgery. After studying at the Pasteur Institute in France he returned to Trinidad in 1913, first as an Assistant Surgeon at the Colonial Hospital in Port of Spain, and later as the District Medical Officer in Tobago and Cedros, in southwestern Trinidad. In 1923 he was appointed as the sole bacteriologist to the government of Trinidad and Tobago. In 1925 there was an outbreak of rabies in cattle in Trinidad, which was first diagnosed as botulism. Humans began contracting rabies in 1929, first diagnosed as poliomyelitis. The outbreak continued until 1937, by which time 89 human fatalities were recorded.Greenhall (1963), p. 15. Pawan found the first infected vampire bat in March 1932. He then soon proved that various species of bat, including fruit-eating bats and particularly the common vampire bat (Desmodus rotundus), with or without artificial infection or the external symptoms of rabies, are capable of transmitting rabies for an extended period of time. \\"Perhaps, the most heretical disclosure was that vampire bats could recover from the furious stage of the disease and were capable of spreading the disease up to five and one half months.\\" It was later shown that fruit bats of the genus Artibeus demonstrate the same abilities. During this asymptomatic stage the bats continue to behave normally and breed. At first, his basic findings that bats transmitted rabies to people and animals were thought fantastic and ridiculed.Greenhall (1963), p. 15. Pawan died on 3 November 1957. He was sometimes referred to as John Lennox Pawan by Arthur Greenhall, who was a close friend and associate.Greenhall (1963), p. 14. It is not certain whether he was ever called \\"John,\\" or whether the references are misprints. > Dr Pawan‚Äôs interests were many and varied. He was the author of numerous > papers and studied such subjects as the water supplies of Trinidad; the > histology of Aedes and Anophole (sic = Anopheles) mosquitos; sickle-cell > anaemia; and the mosquito transmission of Venezuelan Equine > Encephalomeyelitis Virus in Trinidad. But he will best be remembered in the > annals of medical history along with Louis Pasteur for his contributions to > the study of rabies.

The unit was also briefly identified as the 1st Arkansas Infantry Battalion. The unit was most often referred to as the 3rd Confederate Infantry Regiment. The designation \\"Confederate Infantry Regiment\\" was intended to convey the difference between Provisional Confederate Army units and Regular Confederate Army Units, with Provisional units being those regiments who received a state designation such as \\"XX Arkansas Infantry Regiment\\". In practice, the designation was most often utilized when Regiments were assembled utilizing companies from more than one confederate state. The \\"3rd Confederate Infantry Regiment\\" is occasionally misidentified as the 3rd Arkansas Infantry Regiment commanded by Colonel Van H. Manning. Organization The 18th Arkansas Infantry started out as 7 of 22 companies which comprised the so-called \\"Hindman Legion.\\" Col. Thomas C. Hindman had recruited ten companies at his own expense for the 2nd Arkansas Infantry Regiment, and then an additional seven companies at his own expense which, along with four cavalry companies and an artillery battery, became known as the Hindman Legion. The \\"Legion\\" was not approved as an organization, and, after being mustered into the Confederate service on July 27, 1861, reverted to a regiment (the 2nd Arkansas Infantry Regiment), an infantry battalion (the 1st Arkansas Infantry Battalion) and a cavalry battalion (the 6th Arkansas Cavalry Battalion). Capt. John S. Marmaduke was assigned as commander of the 1st Arkansas Infantry Battalion and promoted to lieutenant-colonel on August 1, 1861. A company from the 15th Tennessee Infantry was transferred to the 1st Arkansas Battalion, and two additional companies were added on December 18, 1861, which brought the battalion up to ten companies. On January 1, 1862, the unit was formally designated as a regiment, the 18th Arkansas Infantry, and Marmaduke was promoted to colonel. On January 31, 1862, the regiment was redesignated as the 3rd Confederate Infantry because it contained units from multiple states. Capt. John S.

The regiment and it colors were captured, along with much of Govan's Brigade at the Battle of Jonesboro, Georgia, on Sept. 1, 1864. Due to a special cartel between Union General Sherman and Confederate General John B. Hood, the unit was quickly paroled and exchanged for Union prisoner held at Andersonville Prison. The regiment re-entered service approximately a month later. The 3rd Arkansas and the rest of Govan's Brigade were released and exchanged just in time to participate in General John B. Hood's disastrous Franklin-Nashville Campaign. Brigade effective strength was approximately 550, plus or minus a dozen or so, so each battalion fielded around 100-110 rifles.

It aired on March 21, 2011. Plot The team takes up the case of a homeless man who was accidentally burned by a miniature rocket launched by two boys in a local park. The patient's most striking symptom is confusing various smells (e.g. body odor for peppermint). He also hides his real name and other information, saying that he does not want his abusive father to be drawn into the case. Now that he can fight back, he is afraid that he might kill his father, who apparently abused him as a child by putting out cigarettes on his body. Masters shows sympathy towards the patient due to his desire to do penance for his past deeds and his aspirations of becoming a doctor. Meanwhile, House rides a Segway through the hospital with Dominika Petrova (Karolina Wydra), whom he introduces as his fianc√©e. Confronted by Wilson, House reveals that he is marrying her so she can get her green card; in exchange, she will take care of his specific needs. House later marries her in his apartment, with the rest of the team, Wilson, and Cuddy present as witnesses. Cuddy breaks down when House recites his vows. Afterward, Dominika confides to House that, although the marriage is one of convenience, she really does like him. His response is that he likes her too, but he does not sleep with married women which leaves her shocked. As the team explores various diagnoses, the patient's health begins to deteriorate rapidly. One test reveals 13 bone fragments in his colon, which he says are the result of eating leftovers given to him by a cook at an Italian restaurant. House eventually determines that the patient has been eating a primarily vegetarian diet at the hospital, which in conjunction with Refsum disease has been causing his symptoms. Later, Masters visits the patient's room only to find the rest of the team watching from the hall as FBI agents and SWAT team officers search it for evidence. A DNA sample sent to the lab led to the patient being identified as a cannibalistic serial killer who is wanted in 10 states for a string of 13 murders which leaves Masters completely stunned.

It was established in 1877 by Martynas ≈†ernius (Martin Szernus) and Heinrich Holz in Klaipƒóda (Memel) and continued to be published until September 30, 1940. Initially it promoted pro-Lithuanian ideas and invited writers from Lithuania Major. Its early contributors included Jonas Basanaviƒçius, Jonas ≈†li≈´pas, Georg Sauerwein. The newspaper published news from the region, Germany and Lithuania, until 1918 part of Russia. It also included articles on Lithuanian history, culture, language, and patriotic poems, including Lietuvininkai we are born by Sauerwein and works by Antanas Baranauskas. After Au≈°ra, the first newspaper with contributors from both Prussian and Russian Lithuania, appeared in 1883, Lietuwi√üka Ceitunga became more pro-German and largely abandoned patriotic topics, leaving only articles concerning general news and religious matters. The shift in political attitude was also influenced by threats and economic pressure from German authorities. To counter this, a new more pro- Lithuanian newspaper, Nauja Lietuwi√üka Ceitunga, was published in Tilsit in 1890‚Äì1923. ≈†ernius was editor-in-chief of Lietuwi√üka Ceitunga until it was acquired in June 1905 by the Siebert Press, publishers of vehemently pro- German Memeler Dampfboot. After the Klaipƒóda Region was attached to Lithuania in 1923, Lietuwi√üka Ceitunga was a highly conservative pro-German newspaper. Reportedly, it was not profitable and was funded by Berlin. In later years contributors included Pastor Martin Keturakaitis, Jonas Kikilius, Endrikis Rad≈æi≈´nas, Kristupas Lokys, Ieva Simonaitytƒó. Lietuwi√üka Ceitunga published various supplements, including German-language Beilage zu der Lietuviszka ceitunga and supplements for farmers (Laukinink≈≥ prietelis in 1896‚Äì1900, Lietuvos ≈´kininkas in 1900, Laukininkas in 1929‚Äì1939). It also published free booklets to its subscribers, including shortened The Jewish War by Josephus in 1881 and Nusidavimai apie senuosius pr≈´sus (on history of Old Prussia) by Nikodemas Jaunius in 1906. The newspaper used traditional German blackletter script and Lithuanian language heavily influenced by German vocabulary and style. For example, the word ceitunga is a Lithuanianized version of German Zeitung (newspaper). Lietuwi√üka Ceitunga also capitalized all nouns in the German fashion and used Fraktur letters, including letters w and √ü that do not exist in today's Lithuanian alphabet. Initially it was published once a week, then bi-weekly (1900‚Äì1913), three times a week (1913‚Äì1932), and daily (1932‚Äì1940).

Mosly ‚Äî Clothworker, Lord Mayor of the City of London 1599 Sir Nicholas Mosley (ca. 1527 ‚Äì 12 December 1612), also spelt Mosly and Moseley, was a manufacturer of woolen cloth, who subsequently became lord of the manor of Manchester, and a Lord Mayor of London for the year 1599 to 1600. Nicholas Mosley was born in or near Manchester in c. 1527, supposedly the eldest son of Edward Moseley and his wife Margaret Moseley (n√©e Elcock). With his younger brothers, Oswald (1534-1621), Francis (1535-1570), and Anthonie (1537-1607), he appears to have initiated what became a highly successful business as a woolen manufacturer and merchant. By the early 1550s, Mosley had moved from Manchester to London as a step in the expansion of the business. Mosley went on to become a city of London merchant and a member of the Worshipful Company of Clothworkers. In London (on 20 February 1553) Mosley married Margery Whitbroke at All Hallows, Honey Lane, in the City of London. They were to have a total of nine known children, of whom the youngest, Edward, became a highly successful barrister, was knighted by King James I in 1614; was appointed a justice of the peace and Attorney-General for the Duchy of Lancaster; was elected as an MP for Preston in 1614, 1620-2, and 1624-5; and was the Mosley who first acquired the estates at Rolleston on Dove, in Staffordshire, held by the Mosley family for 400 years from the early 1600s until the 20th Century (see below). Between the early 1560s and the mid to late 1570s, Mosley returned to the Manchester area (where five of his children were baptized at St James' Chapel, Didsbury, between 1562 and 1568). However, after the death of his brother Francis in c. 1570-71, Mosley returned to London to manage the commercial end of the family business. In 1589 Mosley was elected an alderman of the City of London for Aldersgate ward. In 1591 he was a Sheriff of London. In 1592 (following the death of his first wife) he married the widow Elizabeth Hendley (n√©e Rookes) at All Hallows, Bread Street in the City of London. He moved to become alderman for Langbourn ward in 1594, remaining until 1602. In 1596, he bought the manor of Manchester and the same year began to build Hough End Hall at Chorlton-cum-Hardy, Withington. In 1599, he was elected Lord Mayor of London. His mayoralty was notable for the fact that there was a significant threat of Spanish invasion during that year, and Mosley was required to raise funds and forces for the defense of London. He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth I between 15 March ‚Äì 2 July 1600. He was High Sheriff of Lancashire from 1609 to 1610. Mosley was responsible for formalizing the spelling of the family name as \\"Mosley\\" when, in 1592, he sought and obtained \\"the grant of a crest to be borne with his paternal arms, the same being duly entered and then enrolled in the Heralds' College.\\" The text further states that, \\"It became a fashionable practice in the reign of Queen Elizabeth [I] to assume some motto bearing a quaint allusion to the family name, and in conformity with [this fashion], as well as out of compliment to his youngest son, Edward, who was just then rising to eminence in his profession as a barrister, Sir Nicholas adopted the Latin words, 'Mos legem regit' ('Custom, or precedent, rules the law').\\" Mosley died in 1612 and was buried in the Church of St James, Didsbury, where a monument shows him kneeling, \\"dressed in the robes of the Lord Mayor of London\\". In his will, he left ¬£100 to employ a schoolmaster at a salary of ¬£5 a year for 20 years after his death.

Mesenchymal stem cells have the capacity to become any type of fully developed cell, which can contribute to replacing muscle tissues or internal organs. To help discover the therapeutic uses of these stem cells they are grown in laboratories or by using medication to stimulate new cell growth within the human body. In MSC therapy the cells are extracted from the adult patient‚Äôs bone marrow via a procedure called bone marrow aspiration. This usually involves inserting a needle into the back of the patients hip bone and removing the sample from there. These cells are then grown under controlled in vitro conditions in a lab, so that they can multiply and same time mature( also referred to as differentiated. This process may take two to three weeks. The kind of mature, fully differentiated cell phenotype and the number of those cells created though this can be influenced in three ways. Firstly by varying the initial seed density in the culture medium, secondly through changing the conditions of the medium during expansion, and lastly through the addition of additives such as proteins or growth hormones to the culture medium. They are then harvested and put back into the patient through local delivery or systemic infusion.  Therapeutic properties  MSCs possess many properties that are ideal for the treatment of inflammatory and degenerative diseases. They can differentiate into many cell types including bone, fat, and muscle which allow them to treat a large range of disorders. They possess natural abilities to detect changes in their environment, such as inflammation. They can then induce the release of bioactive agents and the formation of progenitor cells in response to these changes. MSCs have also been shown to travel to sites of inflammation far from the injection site. MSCs can be easily extracted through well-established procedures such as bone marrow aspiration. Also, transplanted MSCs pose little risk for rejection as they are derived from the patients own tissue, so are genetically identical, however graft versus host disease is a possibility, where the cells change enough while outside the patient's body that the immune system recognizes them as foreign and can attempt to reject them. This can lead to symptoms such as itchiness, sensitive/raw skin and shedding or dry skin. .  Advantages over embryonic stem cells  Several different forms of stem cells have been identified and studied in the field of regenerative medicine. One of the most extensively studied stem cell types are embryonic stem cells (ESCs). ESCs possess many of the same therapeutic properties as MSCs, including the ability to self-regenerate and differentiate into a number of cell lineages. Their therapeutic abilities have been demonstrated in a number of studies of autoimmunity and neurodegeneration in animal models. However, their therapeutic potential has been largely limited by several key factors. Injected ESCs have been shown to increase the risk for tumor formation in the host patient. Also, the host‚Äôs immune system may reject injected ESCs and thus eliminate their therapeutic effects1. Finally, research has been largely limited due to the ethical issues that surround their controversial procurement from fertilized embryos.  Treated disorders  MSCs have been used to treat a variety of disorders including cardiovascular diseases, spinal cord injury, bone and cartilage repair, and autoimmune diseases. = Treatment for multiple sclerosis = A vast amount research has been conducted in recent years for the use of MSCs to treat multiple sclerosis (MS). This form of treatment for the disease has been tested in many studies of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, the animal model of MS, and several published and on-going phase I and phase II human trials.  Treatment requirements  Current treatments are unable to prevent the accumulation of irreversible damage to the central nervous system (CNS). MS patients experience two major forms of damage, damage resulting from on-going autoimmune induced processes and damage to natural pair mechanisms. Therefore, an ideal treatment must possess both immunomodulating properties to control irregular autoimmune responses to prevent further damage and regenerative properties to stimulate natural repair mechanisms and replace damaged cells.  Therapeutic mechanisms  The exact therapeutic mechanisms of MSCs in the treatment of MS are still very much up to debate among stem cell researchers. Some of the suggested mechanisms are immunomodulation, neuroprotection, and neuroregeneration. * Immunomodulation :MSCs exhibit immunmodulatory properties through the release of bioactive agents such as cytokines that can inhibit autoimmune responses. In patients with MS, autoreactive lymphocytes such as T and B cells cause damage to the CNS by attacking myelin proteins. Myelin proteins make up the myelin sheath that functions in protecting nerve axons, maintaining structural integrity, and enabling the efficient transmission of nerve impulses. By suppressing the unregulated proliferation of T and B cells, MSCs can potentially minimize and control on-going damage to the CNS. :MSCs can also produce an immunomodulating effect by stimulating the maturation of antigen presenting cells. Antigen presenting cells trigger the immune system to produce antibodies that can destroy potentially harmful material. This property allows MSCs to actively contribute to neutralizing harmful autoreactive by-products of MS. * Neuroprotection :MSCs can promote neuroprotection in the CNS of patients with MS which may prevent the progression of the disease to chronic disability. MSCs contribute to neuroprotection through several different mechanisms. These mechanisms include inhibiting apoptosis which will prevent the death of healthy cells and prevent gliosis which will prevent the formation of a glial scar. They can also stimulate local progenitor cells to produce replacement cells that can assist in rebuilding the myelin sheath. * Neuroregeneration :The CNS‚Äôs regenerative abilities are greatly decreased in adults, impairing its ability to regenerate axons following injury. In addition to this natural limitation, MS patients exhibit even greater decreases in neuroregeneration coinciding with increases in neurodegeneration. In particular, MS patients experience a significant decrease in the number of neural stem cells which are responsible for producing large numbers of progenitor cells that are necessary for normal maintenance and function. Decreases in the neural stem cells results in severe damage to the CNS‚Äôs ability to repair itself. This process results in the amplified neurodegeneration exhibited in MS patients. :MSCs have the ability to stimulate neuroregeneration by contributing to cell replacement through differentiating into neural stem cells in response to inflammation. The neural stem cells can then promote the repair of damaged axons and create replacement cells for the damaged tissue. :Regeneration and repair of damaged axons has been shown to occur naturally and spontaneously in the CNS. This shows that it is an environment capable of unassisted, natural healing. naturally possesses an environment that is susceptible to regeneration. MSCs contribute to this regenerative environment by releasing bioactive agents that inhibit apoptosis and thus create an ideal regenerative environment.

Skube has also served as a manager and coach in minor league baseball. During his MLB career, he compiled a .250 batting average with seven hits, one double, one triples, and nine runs batted in (RBIs) in 16 games played. Defensively in the majors, Skube played five games in center field, four games in right field, three games as a designated hitter, and one game at first base. Skube attended Simi Valley High School, and the University of Southern California before turning professional. During the 1979 Major League Baseball draft, the Milwaukee Brewers selected Skube in the 13 round. He made his professional debut that season in the minor leagues with the Class-A Stockton Ports and the Class-A Burlington Bees. Over his minor league career, Skube batted .276 with 634 hits, 140 doubles, 24 triples, and 80 home runs. In 2005, Skube began his coaching career with the Class-A Bakersfield Blaze of the California League. During the next season, he was made manager of the Arizona League Rangers of the rookie-level Arizona League. Since then, Skube has served as the hitting coach for the Class-A Fort Wayne Wizards of the Midwest League (2007), the rookie-level Arizona League Padres of the Arizona League (2008‚Äì09), and the Class-A Lake Elsinore Storm of the California League (2010). Skube currently serves as the Triple-A Tucson Padres hitting coach. Early life Skube was born on October 8, 1957 in Northridge, California. He attended Simi Valley High School in Simi Valley, California. In 1975, while attending Simi Valley High, he was drafted in the fifth round of that year's Major League Baseball (MLB) draft by the Atlanta Braves, but did not sign. Skube then enrolled at the University of Southern California (USC). In 1978, as a member of the USC Trojans baseball team, he was drafted in the 18 round of that year's MLB draft, but did not sign. Later that year, he was a member of the United States collegiate national baseball team, which played the Japanese collegiate national baseball team in Tokyo. In 1979, Skube was named the USC Trojans baseball \\"most improved player\\". That year, he was drafted in the 13 round of the MLB draft by the Milwaukee Brewers. Playing career Skube made his professional baseball career debut in 1979 with the Class-A Burlington Bees in the Milwaukee Brewers minor league organization. In 54 games that season with the Bees, he batted .294 with 26 runs scored, 57 hits, 14 doubles, one triple, nine home runs, 45 runs batted in (RBIs), and 16 stolen bases. Defensively with Burlington, Skube played 43 games in the outfield, and four games at first base, committing eight combined errors. Late in the season, Skube was assigned to the Class-A Stockton Ports of the California League. In one regular season game, he got one hit in five at-bats. He also played with the Ports during the playoffs. In 1980, Skube spent the entire season with the Class-A Stockton Ports. He batted .291 with 132 hits, 26 doubles, seven triples, and 19 home runs in 135 games played. He was fourth in the league in doubles, tied for fifth in home runs, and was seventh in triples. In the field, he played outfield and first base. After the season, Skube won the Eddie Mulligan Award, which is bestowed to the top rookie in the California League. During the 1981 season, Skube was promoted to the Double-A level. He spent the entire year with the El Paso Diablos of the Texas League. In 114 games played, he batted .284 with 89 runs scored, 113 hits, 23 doubles, five triples, 18 home runs, and 59 RBIs. Skube played all of his 114 games with the Diablos in the outfield, committing nine errors, and 170 putouts. At the end of the season, the Milwaukee Brewers purchased Skube's contract, adding him to their 40-man roster. In February 1982, Skube was re-signed by the Milwaukee Brewers. He attended spring training with the Milwaukee Brewers in 1982, and was said to be the leading candidate for the back-up outfielder position on the major league roster. However, Skube started the regular season in the minor leagues with the Triple-A Vancouver Canadians of the Pacific Coast League. In late-August, there were rumors that the Brewers had traded Skube to the Houston Astros in a deal for Don Sutton. However, the Brewers later sent Frank DiPino, and Mike Madden to the Astros to complete the deal. On the season, he batted .279 with 55 runs scored, 121 hits, 26 doubles, two triples, 13 home runs, 61 RBIs, and 13 stolen bases in 130 games played with the Canadians. On September 7, the Brewers called-up Skube to the major leagues. He made his MLB debut against the New York Yankees on September 17, pinch-hitting for designated hitter Roy Howell in the eighth inning. In one at-bat, he got a hit, the first of his major league career. In the major leagues that season, Skube got two hits in three at-bats. Defensively, he played one game in center field. He was also the designated hitter in one contest. Skube started the 1983 season with the Milwaukee Brewers in the majors. He made his season debut on April 10, against the Kansas City Royals, getting no hits, one run scored, and one RBI in two at-bats. In June, Skube was optioned to the minor leagues. Skube's last game of the year in the majors came on May 28, against the Seattle Mariners. It would later prove to be the last game of his MLB career. On the season with the Brewers, he played in 12 games, batting .200 with two runs scored, five hits, one double, one triple, and nine RBIs. Defensively, Skube played four games in center field, four games in right field, and one game at first base. He was also the designated hitter for two games. After the demotion, Skube threatened to quit baseball. However, he eventually accepted the assignment. In the minors, he played with the Triple-A Vancouver Canadians of the Pacific Coast League. His season ended after just 40 games, as he needed surgery on both of his knees. In those games with Vancouver, Skube batted .209 with 15 runs scored, 27 hits, three triples, three home runs, and eight RBIs. In the field, he played 34 games in the outfield, and one game at first base; committing one combined error. In October 1983, the Brewers outrighted Skube to the minor leagues, dropping him from their 40-man roster. During spring training in 1984, Skube was assigned to minor league camp. Skube commented that during the off-season, he had trained harder than ever before, and hoped to make the major league roster. However, he started the season at the Double-A level, with the El Paso Diablos. With El Paso, he batted .312 with 63 hits, 17 doubles, two triples, and six home runs in 56 games played. In late-June, Skube was promoted to the Triple-A Vancouver Canadians, where in 61 games he batted .267 with 56 hits, 13 doubles, four triples, and nine home runs. Between the two teams, Skube played first base and the outfield. The final season of Skube's pro-baseball playing career came in 1985. At the start of the season, he was assigned to Triple-A Vancouver. In 89 games played, he batted .232 with 64 hits, 18 doubles, three triples, and three home runs. Coaching career In 2003, Skube was involved in a baseball camp for the Milwaukee Brewers, which included former players Ken Sanders, Moose Haas, Rob Deer, Del Crandall, Bill Schroeder, Dale Sveum, and Lou Klimchock. In 2005, Skube was hired as the hitting coach for the Class-A Bakersfield Blaze of the California League. That season, the Blaze, who were a Texas Rangers affiliate, went 68‚Äì72. Skube was hired as the manager of the rookie-level Arizona League Rangers in 2006. At the helm, Skube led the Rangers to a 19‚Äì37 record. In 2007, Skube was hired as the hitting coach for the Class-A Fort Wayne Wizards of the Midwest League. The Wizards, who affiliated with the MLB San Diego Padres, had a 55‚Äì84 record that season. Skube returned as a coach in the Padres organization in 2008, getting a position with the rookie-level Arizona League Padres. The Arizona League Padres had a 33‚Äì23 record that season.

In A Certain Beginning a woman is hopelessly trapped between social expectations of money and relationships. Set in the United States, protagonist Yun-ja agrees to marry Chong-il so that he can get a green card.

While both Yun- ja and Chong-il seem open to this possibility at first, Chong-il comes to see his arrangement as the purchase of an aging prostitute. Women are portrayed as having only their bodies as assets and although Yun-ja makes a brave statement of independence at the end of the book, it seems an empty statement given her feelings of vulnerability related to her previous marriage, age, and physical condition.New Voices, Review by Sara Dorow (Fall 1998 issue) Kim's story Almaden is similar.

Marriage does not necessarily involve love between the partners. Christian views on marriage involve love as being central to the marriage relationship, just as Christianity views love as central to human life and human relationship to God (as illustration, the statement from the New Testament that \\"...God is love.\\"). The Christian expectation is that the physical act of making love in marriage will be integrated into a complete love between the two partners. The Catholic Church, like the Orthodox Church, views marriage as a sacrament. The Catechism of the Catholic Church devotes a section to the topic of \\"conjugal love\\" (paragraphs 1643-1654). The first paragraph of that section states, \\"Conjugal love involves a totality, in which all the elements of the person enter - appeal of the body and instinct, power of feeling and affectivity, aspiration of the spirit and of will. It aims at a deeply personal unity, a unity that, beyond union in one flesh, leads to forming one heart and soul; it demands indissolubility and faithfulness in definitive mutual giving; and it is open to fertility. In a word it is a question of the normal characteristics of all natural conjugal love, but with a new significance which not only purifies and strengthens them, but raises them to the extent of making them the expression of specifically Christian values.\\" In the Old Testament book \\"The Song of Songs\\", a physical love affair between a man and a woman is described; Christians have generally taken this book as showing a picture of the love from God to people, and their responding love for God. This interpretation implies there is a strong connection between physical love in a marriage and the love between God and human beings.

Hacking also wrote the script for the film, and it was the director's first feature-length film. It received a limited theatrical release in the UK, taking ¬£121 on its opening weekend from five screens. It was released direct to DVD in the United States. Film critics gave it mostly negative reviews, and the film received a score of 19% on Rotten Tomatoes. Plot After his wife is killed in a car accident, chef Rob Haley (Dougray Scott) is left grief-stricken. A bad review causes him to lose customers at his once successful restaurant, so after talking to his friend Gordon Ramsay (himself), Haley relocates to the countryside with his daughter and some loyal members of his staff to turn a local pub into a gastropub. On the opening day of the restaurant, American food critic Kate Templeton (Claire Forlani) arrives, resulting in an argument with Rob, but the two go on to fall in love and buy a dog. Some of the locals are content with the visitors that the restaurant is bringing to the area, whilst others want it closed down. Rob cooks a special dish with duck that is a hit with the populace. Kate sees to it that Guy Witherspoon (Simon Callow), a renowned food critic, visits the restaurant which results in an excellent report and ongoing success for the restaurant under Haley and Templeton.

The character of Kate Templeton was a play on words based on the fact that the pub it was based on was a local for Kate Middleton, later Duchess of Cambridge. The script was written by James Hacking, who went on to direct the film, marking it as his first full-length feature. Hacking also provided funding for the film himself. Dougray Scott and Claire Forlani were cast opposite each other, although in real life they were husband and wife.https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/2007/06/09/Claire-Forlani-and- Dougray-Scott-wed/27411181407559/ Hacking pursued Gordon Ramsay for a role in the film for some time, but decided not to go through his agents and approached him directly. Ramsay agreed to appear at his own expense. Ramsay's name was misspelt in the closing credits as \\"Ramsey\\". Scenes from the film were shot on site at Elstree Studios. One scene features Michelle Ryan driving an Alfa Romeo. Production on the film was completed in March 2009. Release Love's Kitchen was entered in the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival. The film made its debut showing in the UK at the Kingussie Food on Film Festival in February 2011 under its original name of No Ordinary Trifle. The only actor from the film to make an appearance was Lee Boardman. It took ¬£121 on its opening weekend (on 5 screens) in the UK after release on 24 June 2011, comparing poorly with the same weekend's biggest opening film, Bridesmaids, which took ¬£3.44 million (on 482 screens), including previews of ¬£1.03m. Due to the appearance by Ramsay in the film, the low levels of takings was highlighted by the press who sought to get a response by the chef, but he refused to comment except to state that he wished to have no involvement in the promotion of the film. DVD release in the United States preceded the UK cinema release, with the film going straight to DVD on 7 June. It was also presented at the 2011 Dances With Films independent film festival, where it opened the event, but not entered in the competition. The film was released in the UK on DVD less than three weeks after its cinema release, coming out on 11 July. =Critical reception= Following the release of the trailer for the film, critics began to criticise it as they thought they could guess the entire plot straight away, while Digital Spy's Simon Reynolds predicted that it would be a candidate for the worst film of the year. Following release, the film garnered a 19% approval rating from 16 critics on the review-aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes. The film was heavily criticised upon release by the British media. David Edwards for The Daily Mirror suggested that people should see it \\"for a masterclass in how not to make a film. The effect is like smashing plates over your head while suffering from violent diarrhoea.\\" However, the newspaper also listed the film as a \\"nicely staged British rom- com\\". The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw described the film as \\"abysmal\\", and in particular thought that Gordon Ramsay was \\"excruciating\\". Henry Fitzherbert at the Daily Express described it as \\"astonishingly amateur and awful\\", while Sky Movies critic Tim Evans described it as a \\"veritable banquet of awfulness\\". Empire gave the film a score of two out of five. Total Film thought better of the film, with Emma Dibden describing it as having a \\"sharp script\\" while praising both Dougray Scott and Simon Callow, and giving the film a score of four out of five.

Life The son of George Gardiner (abt 1509 - abt 1536) and Margaret Neville (abt 1515 - 15 October 1559), was born at Berwick-on-Tweed in 1537. He was a scholar of Christ's College, Cambridge, where he proceeded B.A. in 1554. He took the M.A. degree in 1558, having in the meantime become a fellow of Queens' College, Cambridge, an appointment of which he was deprived on 6 August 1561 for his continued absence from Cambridge. In December 1560, supported by Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester who was always a firm friend, he was presented by the queen to the living of Chatton, Northumberland. In or about 1562 he became a minor canon of Norwich Cathedral, and was appointed minister to the church of St. Andrew in the city. He was promoted to be prebendary in 1565, and in 1570 was one of those who entered the choir of the cathedral and, among other acts, broke down the organ. In the previous year, at a metropolitan visitation, articles had been lodged against him charging him with having been ‚Äòa man very unquiet, troublesome, and dissenting, setting debate between man and man.‚Äô It was also said that in Queen Mary's time he had persecuted persons supposed to favour the gospel at the universities. In 1571 Gardiner gave up his Norwich living on being instituted by the Merchant Taylors' Company to the rectory of St Martin Outwich, London, which he resigned in 1574, and in the same year he was collated to the living of Morley, Norfolk. In 1575 he became archdeacon of Norwich. He had represented to Leicester that the appointment had lapsed to the crown in consequence of a prolonged lawsuit between two candidates. The Bishop of Norwich, John Parkhurst, whose own candidate was one of the disputants, refused to recognise Gardiner as archdeacon; but in October 1573 the bishop promised to support him for the deanery, then vacant, if he would give up the archdeaconry. But Gardiner had already had resort to Leicester and Lord Burghley, and was nominated dean unconditionally, in spite of his bishop's opposition. Both Leicester and the queen ordered the bishop to desist, and ultimately Parkhurst and Gardiner were on good terms. Gardiner erected a monument to Parkhurst's memory in the cathedral. In 1573 Gardiner was also appointed chaplain to the queen, and in the following year he was in attendance at court. In the same year he was on a commission of oyer and terminer for the county of Norfolk to examine into offences against the Act of Uniformity. In 1578 he was vicar-general of Norwich, apparently for only a short period. In 1575 he obtained the vicarage of Swaffham by gift of the queen, in 1579 the rectory of Haylesden, in 1580 that of Blofield, in 1583 that of Ashill, and in 1584 that of Forncett, all in Norfolk. He held also the rectory of West Stow, Suffolk. Gardiner had duties too in London, and in February 1587 a formal complaint was made against him, among others, for neglecting to preach at St Paul's Cross according to a monition. As dean of Norwich he improved the revenues of the cathedral. Part of the church lands had been annexed by Sir Thomas Shirley and others, on various pretexts. Gardiner, by dint of his influence at court and many lawsuits, finally, in 1588, obtained a royal warrant ordering the patentees to surrender the church lands, for some compensation. In the later years of his life Gardiner was much invalided by gout. He died about June 1589, and was buried in the south aisle of his cathedral, where was his tomb, with a Latin inscription. A number of his letter are printed in John Strype's Annals. Gardiner was married to Dorothy Constable (abt 1536 - abt 1589) around the year 1564. He had at least two children with her: Sir Thomas Gardiner (abt 1565 - abt 1635) who married Elizabeth White and had issue. Lionel Gardiner (abt 1573 - abt 1610) who married Elizabeth Woodhouse and had issue.

He relocated to New York in 2008. In 2010 hamansutra joined forces with StudioSeidel on the project \\"2010 Amateur World Cup\\". The project, set to music by Gomma Records, presented a fashion collection oriented to the World Cup teams and matches and prominently featuring elements of the aesthetics of pornography, as a satire on the predominant interests of our consumption-driven world. hamansutra is currently working on a line of accessories scheduled for launch at the end of 2011.  Career as graphic designer  Haman Alimardani's work with Jung von Matt in Hamburg gave rise to graphic projects for Benson & Hedges, Audi and Deutsche Bahn in 1998 and 1999. In 2002 Alimardani worked with Nike on the Scorpion K.O. project, realized in partnership with the US media agency Wieden+Kennedy and the Berlin-based creative agency Less Rain. In the same year he was booked by the French fashion house KENZO as a character designer for the \\"KENZO KIDS\\" collection.  Organizational culture  Alimardani's affinity with music is constantly reflected in his design. The hamansutra brand presents clothing as art objects, focusing on a holistic view of external changes which in turn necessitate the alignment of designs in keeping. The slogan \\"A thousand moves in the game of fashion\\" is intended to express this conceptual approach.  Exhibitions  * 2010: hamansutra's CAZAL Sunglasses Project ‚ÄúHomage to Cari Zalloni‚Äù.

Life He was third son of Edward Pellew, 1st Viscount Exmouth and his wife Susan Pellew (nee Frowde) and was born at Flushing, Cornwall, in April 1793. He was educated at Eton College from 1808 to 1811, and admitted as gentleman-commoner at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, on 20 March 1812, graduating B.A. 1815, M.A. 1818, and B.D. and D.D. in November 1828. In 1817 he was ordained in the Church of England. With family connections, his church preferment was rapid. In February 1819 he became, by the gift of the lord chancellor, vicar of Nazeing, Essex. In November 1820 he was advanced by the same patron to the vicarage of Sutton-in-the-Forest, or Sutton Galtries, Yorkshire. He subsequently was appointed seventh canon in Canterbury Cathedral (14 November 1822 to 1828), rector of St. George-the- Martyr, Canterbury (1827‚Äì8), prebendary of Osbaldwick at York Cathedral (15 February 1824 to September 1828), and prebendary of Wistow there (18 September 1828 to 1852). He became rector of St Dionis Backchurch, London (October 1828 to 1852), dean of Norwich 1828, and rector of Great Chart, Kent, 1852; and he held the last two preferments until his death. As Dean of Norwich he had a seat in convocation, where he took an active part in the debates, as a moderate. Pellew died at the rectory, Great Chart, on 13 October 1866, and the east window of the church was afterwards filled with stained glass in his memory. Works Pellew printed sermons and tracts, including a ‚ÄòLetter to Sir Robert Peel on the means of rendering Cathedral Churches most conducive to the Efficiency of the Established Church.‚Äô Many of his sermons were included in two volumes printed in 1848, and entitled ‚ÄòSermons on many of the leading Doctrines and Duties taught by the Church of England.‚Äô In 1847 he published ‚ÄòThe Life and Correspondence of Addington, first Viscount Sidmouth,‚Äô his father-in-law. Family He married, on 20 June 1820, Frances, second daughter of Henry Addington, Prime Minister and first Viscount Sidmouth, and left one son Henry Pellew (who inherited but chose not to assume the title Viscount Exmouth in 1922), and three daughters. His widow died at Speen Hill House, Newbury, Berkshire, on 27 February 1870.

The Firefly platform allows teachers, students and parents to publish and access information from anywhere with an internet connection. Background Firefly Learning was started in 2000 by Joe Mathewson and Simon Hay, two 15-year-old students, at St. Paul‚Äôs School in London, who developed it during school holidays, after they became frustrated with the school‚Äôs antiquated internet system. They developed the concept during lunch breaks at the physics labs and teachers at St. Paul's began using the system. Soon afterward, Forest School expressed interest in the new system. In 2010, students at Wellington College stranded due to ash cloud grounding thousands of flights were able to continue with their lessons via an e-learning platform provided by Firefly Learning. In 2012 BETT nominated Firefly for an Innovation in ICT award for its development of the Student Planner iPad app that automatically updated students' planners with assignments assigned by the teacher. Firefly has been named a BETT finalist every year since, and in 2014 won an innovation award in London. In November 2016, Firefly raised $5.6 million (¬£4.5 million) Series A funding round from BGF Ventures and Beringea. By that time, Firefly learning was used by 480 schools in 32 countries.  Services  The cloud-based support platform used by Firefly allows teachers to set homework assignments, track students' progress, provide feedback and share learning resources, on it. The platform has desktop and mobile apps, it also has its own API for education software providers allowing the users to plug in their content.  Issues  On 23rd March 2020, high demand from schools and pupils working remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a severe Firefly overload, with many users experiencing slowdowns or complete outages.

Among his published works are Theories of Truth (his most-cited work, published by MIT Press in 1992), \\"Does the Gettier Problem Rest on a Mistake?\\" Mind (1984. Vol. 93, No. 372),Online version: and \\"On Paradoxes and a Surprise Exam\\" Philosophia (1991).http://philpapers.org/s/Richard%20L.%20Kirkham Kirkham graduated from Cornell College in 1977 and received his Ph.D. from the University of Notre Dame in 1983. Philosophical work Kirkham is probably best known for his work on analytic theories of truth. His 1992 book, Theories of Truth: A Critical Introduction, was received positively upon release.For examples, see Carlin Romano, If there are philosopher-kings, why not philosopher-journalists? Boston Sunday Globe, 12/5/1993, p. B21 (Boston, MA): \\"excellent new book\\" and Frederick F Schmidt, Truth: A Primer, Westview Press: 1995. In the book, Kirkham proposes that the various theories of truth proposed through the centuries are really not all in competition with one another after all, because they are often intended to answer distinct questions about truth. For example, some have been intended only to provide the extensional necessary and sufficient conditions for truth, while others have been intended to provide a definition of truth, and still others are intended only to explain the linguistic and non-linguistic purposes of statements that predicate truth or falsity. According to MIT Press, this book is their all-time best-selling work in analytic philosophy and nearly half of all English-reading professional philosophers in the world own a personal copy of the book. It has been used as a text in graduate seminars on every inhabited continent and translated into Portuguese. He is also the author of four articles in the Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Routledge, 1998).
