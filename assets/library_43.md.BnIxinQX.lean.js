Founded in 2011, it ceased publication in December 2019. The publication focused on history, photography, art, and design, but also included articles on architecture, fashion, science, DIY, adventure, and literature. The magazine's title is derived from the traditional artisans and craftsmen ‚Äì such as wordsmiths or blacksmiths ‚Äì who embody the down-to-earth quality the magazine attempted to emulate. It was designed to attract readers interested in \\"real people doing real things, guys that are making stuff, creative thinkers, adventurers, whatever.\\" Smith Journal was published by Frankie Press, creators of popular Australian magazine frankie. History and profile Smith Journal was founded by frankie press editors-at-large Rick Bannister and Louise Bannister as a men‚Äôs magazine in the same vein as frankie. The magazine was lauded for sharing the same \\"inquisitive nature, intelligent copy and compelling stories\\" as frankie. Frankie Press editor-at- Large Louise Bannister stated that frankie and Smith Journal were \\"from the same family ‚Äì lots of white space‚Ä¶but the treatment of pictures and text is a little different.\\" Smith Journal was initially designed by frankie magazine's Creative Director, Lara Burke, with additional input from frankie's editor, Jo Walker and Senior Contributor, Benjamin Walker. However, Bannister was quick to point out that despite the similarities, \\"Smith is its own thing.\\" When the magazine launched in September 2011, men's magazines were declining significantly in sales and reader numbers. For example, FHM had posted a 20% drop from 2010 to 2011 to reach a record low of 40,000 circulated copies in Australia, and Zoo Weekly had dropped 18% to 83,000 circulated copies. Other men's titles such as Alpha, Sport & Style, and Ralph all folded in the same span of time. In response to the decision to launch a new men's magazine when a large number of others were closing, then editorial director Louise Bannister suggested Smith Journal was not intended to appeal to a mass audience, but instead to a smaller group of people interested in \\"something they can't get on the internet.\\" The first issue of Smith Journal was published on 5 September 2011. Frankie Press circulated 20,000 copies of the first issue which contained 140 pages. Similarly to frankie, the magazine was printed on premium matte paper stock, and marketed as a \\"bespoke\\" title suitable as both a casual read and coffee table magazine. The magazine was initially published biannually, but adopted a quarterly publishing schedule following its positive reception. Smith Journal's publisher Morrison Media moved production of its titles to Melbourne in February 2014 when it closed its Queensland-based offices. In November that year, Morrison Media was acquired by Pacific Star Network for . Closure In September 2018, Smith Journal publisher Morrison Media was purchased by Australian magazine publisher Nextmedia from Pacific Star Network, as part of a deal to acquire the magazine's sister publication frankie. Smith Journal continued publication for another year before it was closed down. \\"It wasn‚Äôt a problem with readership, it was a problem with advertising revenue,\\" editor Chris Harrigan said in 2019. \\"How you can model your business to provide people with the stories that they want: I mean, that sounds like it should be easy enough to do, but for whatever reason‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs no surprise to anyone that publishing is not the healthiest it‚Äôs ever been, and it hasn‚Äôt been in a decade.\\" Content The magazine's niche content and minimalistic design were a direct response to the salacious, populist \\"lad mags\\" such as FHM and Zoo Weekly that dominated the men's magazine market at the time of Smith Journal's launch. Other magazines targeted to men had either a very broad audience such as Men's Health, or were hobby-specific titles dedicated to a single topic. Instead of attempting to engage as many readers as possible through glossy pages filled with current-events topics, the editors of Smith Journal felt that there was a \\"gap in the market for guys who felt that their magazines hadn't grown or changed with them.\\" According to founding editor Nadia Saccardo, Smith Journal was not created specifically for men, but was instead focused on \\"unexpected, accessible storytelling coupled with great photography and illustration.\\" \\"People [have] unique pursuits that become quite singular, and tend to consume them in ways, and I felt our job was to take these very niche fields and explain them to people who wouldn‚Äôt otherwise rub up against them,\\" editor Chris Harrigan said in 2019. The magazine used plentiful white space and full- page photography and illustration. The front section, 'Smith Stuff', compiled \\"short tit bits of weird, wonderful and why\\". Each issue also included a tear- out poster of an illustration or diagram. For example, Volume 25 featured an illustrated diagram of the 2018 lunar calendar, and Volume 18 included a twenty-sided icosahedron globe. Thematically, Smith Journal \\"moves where it will and that really is anywhere; columns from aging rock-stars, photo essays, features on primitive skills practitioners and investigations into international (bee) hive heists.\\" For instance, Volume 25 profiled photographer Daniel George, whose portfolio consists of household items used for target practice; an article discussing the cultural re-evaluation of 1980s hair metal music; and an interview with former NASA scientist Robert Lang who now designs origami. Previous issues included interviews with American musician Henry Rollins, and professional safe-cracker Jeff Sitar, an historical article on Soviet rocket architect Galina Balashova, and Brazil's illegal hot air balloon subculture. Designer Christopher Roosen, a loyal reader who owned all 33 issues, eulogised Smith Journal in 2019: \\"Unashamedly thick and full of long-form articles sandwiched between heavy card covers, it covered an eclectic range of topics from the past, present and future, inclusive of all types of people, places, things and ideas.\\"  Readership  Smith Journal's readers were predominantly male; however in 2018, 30% of its readers were female. The magazine's 2018 media kit stated that 58% of its readers were aged between 25 and 44, and that 70% were university educated or were currently studying. Former editor Nadia Saccardo described the magazine's reader as curious and open-minded and that the content was designed to attract readers \\"who feel like they have been ignored, or would not traditionally pick up magazines.\\" Editor-at-Large Rick Bannister elaborated on this statement by describing the magazine's average reader as someone who is creative and interested in reviving old traditions such as \\"brewing, or making furniture, or restoring bikes.\\" Besides the quarterly issue, the magazine also published content on its website smithjournal.com.au. The website published selected articles from the print magazine, plus weekly blog posts that covered a wider range of subjects and topics than the magazine. In 2018 the website received a six-month average of 19,900 unique visitors, and 41,150+ average pageviews per month. Back issues and digital editions of Smith Journal were also sold in Frankie Press's online shop. At the time of its closure in December 2019, Smith Journal had a readership of 32,000 print distribution, 13,000 e-newsletter subscribers, over 30,000 monthly average pageviews, 15,000 unique users, and 66,800 social media fans.

Jacopo Dal Verme (1350 - 12 February 1409) was an Italian condottiero. Biography Born at Verona, he was the son of condottiero Luchino Dal Verme and Jacopa di Bonetto de' Malvesini. He began his military career in 1366, first under Alberico da Barbiano and then Cansignorio della Scala, lord of Verona, for whom in 1368 he fought against the Bonacolsi of Mantua. In 1370 he was hired by the Visconti of Milan to recover the Val Tidone. In 1378 Dal Verme was again fighting for the Scaligers of Verona, this time against Bernab√≤ Visconti, but the following year he returned to Milan as councellor for Gian Galeazzo Visconti, and as general commander in the campaign against John III of Montferrat. In 1385 he took part in the capture of Bernab√≤ Visconti. In 1387, taking advantage of the struggles between the Republic of Venice and the commune of Padua, Dal Verme obtained the latter's surrender. In 1391, again under the Visconti's aegis, he defeated the French invasion troops under Jean III of Armagnac at the Battle of Alessandria. In 1397, in the war between the Viscontis and the Gonzaga of Mantua, he occupied Borgoforte and Governolo, but was later defeated by Carlo Malatesta. Dal Verme was anyway instrumental in the signature of a peace between Francesco I Gonzaga and the Viscontis. The latter then turned to the conquest of Bologna, then ruled by Giovanni Bentivoglio. Dal Verme and the other commander Alberico da Barbiano won the battle of Casalecchio (26 June 1402), after which Bologna fell and Bentivoglio was killed. However, after Gian Galeazzo Visconti's death the following year, Dal Verme was forced to cede Bologna. Dal Verme also served under Gian Galeazzo's successor, Giovanni Maria Visconti, in particular defeating the other condottiero Facino Cane in the battle of Binasco. However, in 1407 his relationships with Giovanni Maria fell and Dal Verme switched to the Republic of Venice. He died there in 1409. He was buried next to his father in the family mausoleum inside the church of Sant'Eufemia at Verona. His son Luigi dal Verme was also a condottiero.

Luchino Dal Verme (c. 1320 - early 1367) was an Italian condottiero. Biography He was a member of a noble family of Verona, and his father was a supporter of Cangrande I della Scala. In 1341 he defended Lucca first for Mastino I della Scala, then for the Republic of Florence. His friendship with poet Francesco Petrarca is documented for the first time in 1350, when he was likely at the service of the Visconti of Milan. In 1352 he fought in Toscana for the Visconti. In 1354 he had to flee from Verona due to his support to Fregnano della Scala's failed coup against Cangrande II della Scala. The same year he defended Bologna for Giovanni Visconti, and, the following year, he was governor in Genoa. After the split of the Visconti lands between Bernab√≤ and Galeazzo II Visconti, Dal Verme sided for the former. In 1359 he commanded the siege of the rebel Pavia. Two years later, he sided for Galeazzo, who named him as captain-general of Piedmont, where Dal Verme fought against the Marquisate of Montferrat and the English troops that were routing the area at the time. After advice from Petrarca, in 1364 he accepted from the Republic of Venice the task of suppressing the Revolt of Saint Titus, a rebellion that had broken out in Crete. On May 7, Dal Verme landed in the island with 800 horse and 2,000 infantry troops. His success there granted Dal Verme the title of Venetian noble. After this period, there are little sources about Dal Verme's life: for sure it is known, in particular from Petrarca's letters, that he was in Terra Santa. His exact date and place of death are unknown, however he likely died early in 1369 around Constantinople. His son Jacopo Dal Verme was also a condottiero.

Biography  First of all, Cantor turned his attention towards the interpretation of ancient music by the ensembles Ensemble Cl√©ment Janequin, Huelgas Ensemble, and Ensemble Organum. His soloist career began with the ensemble Les Arts Florissants of William Christie, of which he was one of the pillars during the 1980s, along with Agn√®s Mellon, Guillemette Laurens, Jill Feldman, Monique Zanetti, Dominique Visse, √âtienne Lestringant, Michel Lapl√©nie, Gregory Reinhart, Fran√ßois Fauch√©, and Antoine Sicot. He also sang the baroque repertoire under the direction of Jean-Claude Malgoire, Sigiswald Kuijken, Ren√© Jacobs, Christophe Coin, David Stern, Jean-Christophe Frisch and Gilbert Bezzina with whom he made several recordings. In 1992, he won the Concours de Rennes for his interpretation of Golaud's role (Pell√©as et M√©lisande - Debussy) and approached the roles of the 19th and 20th century repertoire, until the creation of contemporary works by Antoine Duhamel, Pierre Jansen, Jacques Veyrier, Jean-Claude Wolff (who composed several cycles of melodies for him); Maurice Ohana, Henri Dutilleux, Philippe Forget conducted by Jean- Marc Cochereau (Orchestre R√©gion-centre), Robert Martignoni (Orchestre de Bretagne), Philippe Bender (Orchestre R√©gional Provence-C√¥te d'Azur), Jean- Louis Forestier (Ensemble Musique vivante), Jacques Mercier (Orchestre national d'√éle-de-France), Christian Zacharias (Orchestre de Chambre de Lausanne), and Ensemble 2e2m. Today, he divides his activities between Baroque music (with the conducted by Gilbert Bezzina; the ensemble Fuoce E Cenere - Jay Bernfeld; La Compagnie F√™tes Galantes - B√©atrice Massin); oratorios; recitals (with pianists Sophie Rives, Mara Dobresco, Jean-Fran√ßois Ballevre, Didier Puntos, Laurent Wagschal; chamber music (with the vocal ensemble \\"Les Solistes de Lyon\\" led by Bernard Tetu, accompanied by Philippe Cassard, No√´l Lee, Jean-Claude Pennetier) and the stage where he was particularly noticed in the roles of Pimpinone (Telemann), Don Alfonso (Mozart: Cosi fan Tutte), Leporello (Mozart: Don Giovanni), Mamma Agata (Donizetti), Golaud (Debussy): Pell√©as and M√©lisande), The Celebrant (Bernstein: Mass), Macbeth (Philippe Forget: Macbeth) to the musical Sweeney Todd (Sondheim).

H. Lawrence novel The Rainbow (1915). Outline Ursula Brangwen is the eldest child of Will Brangwen, a farmer, and his wife Anna. She has a fascination with rainbows and one day she runs away from home looking for the pot of gold at the end of one. As a teenager, Ursula has a crush on Winifred Inger, her gym mistress at the girls' high school, and she also has romantic feelings for Anton Skrebensky, who is at the boys' high school. They spend a lot of time together, including hill walking. Ursula agrees to become a nude model for a local artist, but she walks out after he makes a pass at her. She is jealous when Winifred gets engaged to her Uncle Henry. Ursula and Anton leave school. He joins the army and goes to fight in the Second Boer War, while she moves to London and gets a job as a schoolteacher at an elementary school in the East End of London, where she has to fend off unwanted advances from the headmaster of the school. A year later, in the spring of 1901, Ursula returns to the farm and meets Anton, just home from the war, and they begin an affair. Ursula also starts to work for the Derbyshire miners union. When she thinks she is pregnant, Anton wants to marry her, but she turns him down, and he goes away. After fighting off an attempted rape by two miners, Ursula gets a telegram from Anton to say he has married someone else and has been posted to British India. During a rainstorm, a rainbow appears, and Ursula packs a suitcase and again runs away from home, chasing the rainbow. Her story is continued in D. H. Lawrence's novel Women in Love.

Many parts of Scotland are protected in accordance with a number of national and international designations because of their environmental, historical or cultural value. Protected areas can be divided according to the type of resource which each seeks to protect. NatureScot has various roles in the delivery of many environmental designations in Scotland, i.e. those aimed at protecting flora and fauna, scenic qualities and geological features. Historic Environment Scotland is responsible for designations that protect sites of historic and cultural importance. Some international designations, such as World Heritage Sites, can cover both categories of site. The various designations overlap considerably with many protected areas being covered by multiple designations with different boundaries. National environmental designations=National parks= Map of the national parks of Scotland The national parks of Scotland are managed areas of outstanding landscape where some forms of development are restricted to preserve the landscape and natural environment. At present, Scotland has two national parks: Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park, created in 2002, and the Cairngorms National Park, created in 2003. Unlike the national parks of many other countries, the national parks of Scotland are not areas of uninhabited land owned by the state. The majority of the land is in the ownership of private landowners (including conservation bodies such as the National Trust for Scotland), and people continue to live and work in the parks. Although the landscapes often appear \\"wild\\" in character, the land is not wilderness, as it has been worked by humans for thousands of years. Like their English and Welsh counterparts the national parks of Scotland are effectively \\"managed landscapes\\", and are classified as IUCN Category V Protected Landscapes because of this. =National nature reserves= National nature reserves (NNRs) are areas of land or water designated under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 to contain habitats and species of national importance. NNRs can be owned by public, private, community or voluntary organisations but must be managed to conserve their important habitats and species, as well as providing opportunities for the public to enjoy and engage with nature. There are currently 43 NNRs in Scotland, which cover less than 1.5% of the land area of Scotland. NatureScot is responsible for declaring NNRs in Scotland, having taken advice from the NNR Partnership comprising representatives of the NNR managing and community and land-owning organisations. The majority of NNRs are directly managed by NatureScot; however, some are managed by, or in co-operation with other bodies such as Forestry and Land Scotland, the National Trust for Scotland and RSPB Scotland. Most NNRs in Scotland overlap Sites of Special Scientific Interest; many are also Special Areas of Conservation and/or Special Protection Areas. =National scenic areas= Glen Affric is designated as both a NSA and NNR. There are 40 national scenic areas (NSAs) in Scotland, covering 13% of the land area of Scotland. The 40 NSAs were originally identified by the Countryside Commission for Scotland in 1978 as areas of \\"national scenic significance... of unsurpassed attractiveness which must be conserved as part of our national heritage\\". =Sites of Special Scientific Interest= Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) are the basic building block of site-based nature conservation legislation in the United Kingdom (Areas of Special Scientific Interest in Northern Ireland), and most other legal nature/geological conservation designations in Great Britain, including national nature reserves, Ramsar sites, Special Protection Areas, and Special Areas of Conservation, are based upon them. Sites notified for their biological interest are known as Biological SSSIs, and those notified for geological or physiographic interest are Geological SSSIs. Many SSSIs are notified for both biological and geological interest. =Marine protected areas= Scotland's network of Marine protected areas (MPAs) consists of more than 230 designated areas, covered by various designations including Special Areas of Conservation, Special Protection Areas and Sites of Special Scientific Interest. In order to strengthen the protection of marine areas seventeen Nature Conservation Marine Protected Areas (NCMPAs) were designated within Scotland's territorial waters (i.e. within ). A further thirteen protected areas are beyond the 12 mile limit and are therefore designated by the Joint Nature Conservation Committee rather than NatureScot. National designations for historic and cultural sites=Scheduled ancient monuments= A scheduled monument is a \\"nationally important\\" archaeological site or historic building, given protection against unauthorised change. The protection provided to scheduled monuments is given under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979, which is a different law from that used for listed buildings (see below). According to the 1979 Act, a monument cannot be a structure which is occupied as a dwelling, used as a place of worship or protected under the Protection of Wrecks Act 1973. As a rule of thumb, a protected historic asset that is occupied would be designated as a listed building. =Listed buildings= The Forth Bridge is designated as both a Category A listed building and a World Heritage Site A listed building or listed structure is one that has been placed on the statutory list maintained by Historic Environment Scotland. A listed building may not be demolished, extended, or altered without special permission from the local planning authority, which typically consults the relevant central government agency, particularly for significant alterations to the more notable listed buildings. The degree of protection depends on whether a building is classified as Category A, B or C, Category A denoting the highest level of protection. There are about 47,400 listed buildings in Scotland. Of these, around 8 percent (some 3,800) are Category A, and 50 percent are Category B, with the rest listed at Category C. =Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland= The Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland is a listing of gardens and designed landscapes of national artistic and/or historical significance, in Scotland. The inventory was originally compiled in 1987, and now covers sites dating from the medieval period through to the 20th century. From 1991 the inventory, which is a continually evolving list, was maintained by Historic Scotland and Scottish Natural Heritage, and it is now updated by a dedicated team within Historic Environment Scotland. As of 2019 the inventory included over 300 sites across Scotland, ranging in size from one hectare to well over 1000 hectares. =Inventory of Historic Battlefields= The Inventory of Historic Battlefields in Scotland lists nationally significant battlefields. It was first published for consultation in December 2010 by Historic Scotland, and formally launched in May 2011. the inventory, which is now maintained by Historic Environment Scotland (successor body to Historic Scotland), lists 40 battlefields on the inventory, the most recent addition being the Battle of Sark which was listed in 2016. International designations=World Heritage Sites= World Heritage Sites are locations that have been included in the UNESCO World Heritage Programme list of sites of outstanding cultural or natural importance to the common heritage of humankind. Historic Environment Scotland is responsible for cultural sites, whilst the Scottish Government's Environment & Forestry Directorate is responsible for natural sites. As of 2018 there are 6 sites in the country, with a further 2 undergoing a process of formal evaluation. =Ramsar sites= Ramsar sites are internationally recognised wetland sites, protected under the terms of the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, which was developed and adopted by participating nations at a meeting in Ramsar, Iran, on 2 February 1971. At the end of 2010, 160 states were contracting parties to the Convention, and the worldwide total of sites was 1,920. The United Kingdom was one of 18 original signatories to the Convention, and has since designated 168 Ramsar sites. 51 of these sites are within Scotland, including one site, the Upper Solway Flats and Marshes, which covers parts of both Scotland and England in the Solway Firth. The total area of all Ramsar sites in Scotland is approximately . All of Scotland's Ramsar sites form part of the European Natura 2000 network as either Special Protection Areas or Special Areas of Conservation, and many sites are further protected as Sites of Special Scientific Interest. =Natura 2000= Natura 2000 is a network of nature protection areas in the territory of the European Union. It is made up of Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) and Special Protection Areas (SPAs) designated under the Habitats Directive and Birds Directive respectively. The network includes both terrestrial and marine sites (Marine Protected Areas (MPAs)). Special Areas of Conservation A Special Area of Conservation (SAC) is defined in the European Union's Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC), also known as the Directive on the Conservation of Natural Habitats and of Wild Fauna and Flora. They are to protect the 220 habitats and approximately 1000 species listed in annex I and II of the directive which are considered to be of European interest following criteria given in the directive. They must be chosen from the Sites of Community Importance by the State Members and designated SAC by an act assuring the conservation measures of the natural habitat. Special Protection Areas A Special Protection Area (SPA) is a designation under the European Union Directive on the Conservation of Wild Birds. Under the Directive, Member States of the European Union (EU) have a duty to safeguard the habitats of migratory birds and certain particularly threatened birds. Local designations=Local nature reserves= Local nature reserves, of which there are 74, are designated by local authorities, and are usually close to towns and cities. The land is usually owned or leased by the local authority: where another person or body is the owner, the owner must formally agree to the designation. =Conservation areas= A conservation area is an area considered worthy of preservation or enhancement because of its special architectural or historic interest. In conservation areas, it is the protection of the quality and special interest of the neighbourhood or area as a whole that is intended, rather than specific buildings, which are protected by having listed status. Conservation areas are used to protect features such as groups of buildings, open spaces, street patterns, trees, and historic gardens. Scotland has around 600 conservation areas, which are controlled by local authorities. =Regional parks= Regional parks are defined to co-ordinate the management of areas of attractive countryside that are of importance for recreation due to their proximity to population centres. The parks have been defined and are managed by local authorities. Currently Scotland has three regional parks: *Clyde Muirshiel Regional Park *Lomond Hills Regional Park *Pentland Hills Regional Park Non-statutory protected areas In addition to statutory designations, many areas are protected by virtue of being owned by a conservation organisation. Such areas may also have legal protection, however there are many areas that are protected despite having no statutory designation. Examples of bodies owning land and property for conservation purposes in Scotland include: *John Muir Trust *National Trust for Scotland *Scottish Wildlife Trust *Royal Society for the Protection of Birds =Forest parks= Forest parks are areas of forest managed by Forestry and Land Scotland (FLS) that are managed for multiple benefits, with an emphasis on recreation facilities for visitors. There are currently six forest parks in Scotland.

The fort was renovated several times, first during the era of the ruler Hammuda Pasha in the mid-17th century, which added a moat leading to the bottom area of the medina quarter, and watchtowers, walls, and other fortifications. These structures were repaired in 1806 by the hand of the Dutch engineer known as Humbolt, also adding new towers on the northern side. The kasbah also contains a space surrounded by rooms, a mosque, ammo, and basin for collecting rainwater. Today, the building is a tourist spot as well as often used as a venue for festivals.

Its founding members were professors Mariano Artigas, Juan Luis Lorda, Antonio Pardo, Carlos Perez, Francisco Gallardo and Santiago Collado. Since its inception, in addition to other teachers from the University of Navarra, the group has incorporated prestigious intellectuals and experts on the topics of interest as collaborating members: Evandro Agazzi, William Shea, Juan Arana and Tito Arecchi are some of the present collaborators. Professor Artigas was appointed the first director of the group, a position he held until his death. The contribution of his intellectual output, which the group has inherited as his legacy, could be summarized as having contributed to unify and highlight the relationship between science and religion. In this endeavor, it is important not to reduce thought to mere scientific rationality, where science is understood as empirical or experimental science. The name of the group expresses this conviction: science, reason and faith. The CRYF is currently considered one of the centers that has contributed most to explore the common ground shared by science, philosophy and theology in southern Europe. The CRYF has received funding from the Templeton Foundation twice. In 2006, for the project entitled \\"The Human Singularity: The Origin, Nature, and Destiny of the Human Being\\" and in 2011, in order to set up the \\"Mariano Artigas Memorial Lectures\\".Jos√© M. Gimenez-Amaya - Santiago Collado (2011-2014). ¬´Mariano Artigas Memorial Lecture (MAML)¬ª. The Mariano Artigas Lectures are held every two years in October and have a two-fold purpose: to honor the figure of Professor Artigas and to recognize the work done by the invited lecturer in the field of the relations between science and religion. Previous speakers have been William Shea in 2011, Karl Giberson in 2013 and Giuseppe Tanzella-Nitti in 2015. In 2017, the Lecture was entrusted to Spanish philosopher Juan Arana. At the beginning of 2007, after the death of Mariano Artigas, the professor of Physics, H√©ctor Mancini replaced him as head of the group until the beginning of 2010. During the period 2010-2016 the director was the neuroscientist, philosopher and priest Jos√© Manuel Gim√©nez Amaya. Since the beginning of 2016, this position is held by the physicist, theologian and priest Javier S√°nchez Ca√±izares. Interests and objectives Broadly speaking, the CRYF group is interested in discussing the big issues from the perspective of the dialogue between science, reason and faith. Specifically, the main topics of interest are the following: * Origin of man, origin of life and origin of the universe * Nature and causes of evolution * Mind-brain relationship * Relations between science and truth * Relations between science and religion * Order, complexity and purpose * Classic science-faith debates (Galileo case) and current ones (creationism and evolutionism) More specific goals of the group are: to promote among its members research and publications on the topics of interest; to develop lessons and teaching materials for intra- and extra-mural education; to make available, through the Internet, an archive of documents on the areas of interest that could be useful as teaching material and for outreach activities; and to promote the organization of activities, collaborations and scientific meetings that can help achieve the goals of the group. Activities and some outcomes The CRYF group organizes monthly open seminars with invited speakers, followed by a discussion in which academics from various areas of expertise (such as theology, physics, medicine, philosophy and biology) exchange ideas and opinions. These seminars may also have the format of a round table or a workshop, and they are uploaded to the YouTube channel of the University of Navarra. One activity that deserves special mention was the workshop organized by the CRYF in collaboration with the \\"Thomas More Institute\\" of London in 2009, to study the contributions of Mariano Artigas. The presentations of that meeting were later collected and published in the book \\"Science and Faith Within Reason\\". In collaboration with the Nicolaus Copernicus University of Torun (Poland), the CRYF group publishes the interdisciplinary scientific journal \\"Scientia et Fides\\" twice a year. This peer-reviewed open-access magazine publishes original articles addressing in a rigorous way the relationships between science and religion from different perspectives. The second issue of 2016 was a special number commemorating the tenth anniversary of the death of Mariano Artigas. With regard to teaching, the CRYF group teaches three courses on issues related to science and religion at the University of Navarra. It also collaborates regularly with the Higher Institute of Religious Sciences of the same University. The members of the CRYF are available to give seminars or conferences on the topics of interest to any institution requesting it. Several schools, cultural foundations and universities across Spain, Europe and Latin America have already benefited from this collaboration.

The Military Physics Institute was established in 1940 by the Swedish National Committee for Physics (Svenska nationalkommitten f√∂r fysik) and the year after state funding for the operation was applied. Research within the Military Physics Institute focused on the development of new weapons of defense. These include surveys of the military use of infrared radiation as well as the problems of shaped charge. An area in S√∂dert√∂rn near Grindsj√∂n was donated by Olof Arrhenius, at which the institute built a test station for the operations.

It is set in Porto Alegre and follows a young gay man called Pedro (Shico Menegat) who performs on video chat using body paint as his trademark. The film was screened at the 68th Berlin International Film Festival, winning the Teddy Award for the best LGBTQ feature film of the festival. Directors Filipe Matzembacher (left) and Marcio Reolon (right)  Plot  The film centres on Pedro (Shico Menegat), a shy young man who works as a performer on a gay-oriented video chat website. His trademark is to dance while smearing neon body paint over his body; the film's central conflict is set in motion when he learns that another chatroom performer (Boy25) is imitating him. Pedro arranges to meet Boy25 (Leo played by Bruno Fernandes) and they become lovers, but it is hard for Pedro to trust anyone. He has previously been pushed to breaking point by bullies and whilst his sister knows him well, he has to lie to his grandmother about how he makes money. His mother is dead and his father is not around. Pedro leads a double life in which he is introverted until he goes online and assumes his alternative identity NeonBoy. A real-life sexual encounter goes wrong but then despite losing Leo (who is following his dreams and moving to Europe), at the end of the film Pedro is dancing and open to new beginnings.  Cast  * Shico Menegat as Pedro * Bruno Fernandes as Leo * Guega Peixoto as Luiza (Pedro's sister) * Sandra Dani as Av√≥ (Pedro's grandmother) * Frederico Vasques as Beto  Themes  Hard Paint explores the theme of isolation, since Pedro performs online from a studio in his bedroom and withdraws from the wider world. He has difficult relationships with his family and the other people he meets. This depiction of Pedro then creates a picture of a fragmented world in which people are alienated from each other. This feeling of loneliness can also be applied to the city of Porto Alegre, from which many young people move away (like Pedro's sister) leaving the people who remain with only memories.  Critical response  Internationally, Hard Paint was a critical success. Variety praised the \\"picture of a fragmented society barely able to foster empathetic connections\\". Sight & Sound suggested the film was a \\"potential LGBTQ breakout hit\\" and whilst cautioning that it was a looser film than other recent crossover successes such as God‚Äôs Own Country and A Fantastic Woman, called it \\"entertainingly unpredictable\\". Screen Daily enjoyed the \\"fluid cinematography\\" of Glauco Firpo saying it caught \\"the quasi-fairytale quality of a boy who lives on the outside of his life, looking in\\". Mature Times called the film a \\"poignant character study\\". The Hollywood Reporter remarked that Hard Paint \\"at times recalls Moonlight, not just structurally, in its separately titled three-part breakdown, but also in its moving observation of a vulnerable gay male protagonist in an unaccommodating environment\\". Australian Cinematographer, the magazine of the Australian Cinematographers Society, called the film \\"stunning\\" and \\"beautiful\\".  Accolades  * Hard Paint was screened in the Panorama section at the 68th Berlin International Film Festival, where it won the Teddy Award as the best LGBTQ-themed feature film of the festival. It also won the Art Cinema Award. *Best Fiction Film, Best Actor (Shico Menegat), Best Supporting Actor (Bruno Fernandes), Best Script at Rio de Janeiro International Film Festival. * Premio Maguey for Best Feature Film at the 2018 Guadalajara International Film Festival. *Best International Narrative award at Outfest 2018. * Special Mention at the 2018 Chicago International Film Festival. * Special Mention at Kyiv International Film Festival \\"Molodist\\".

In his review of Landscapes of Power and Identity for The Hispanic American Historical Review, David Block argues that \\"By narrating the interrelationship between humans and their natural surroundings, [Radding] challenges her readers to examine our understanding of the different ways that new societies formed on American frontiers and of the nature of boundaries themselves\\" and states that her \\"most important contribution ... is her thoughtful commentary on the nature of boundaries\\".David Block, review of Landscapes of Power and Identity in Hispanic American Historical Review, vol. 87, no. 1 (2007), pp. 211‚Äì212.

This protein expression technology is also used for off-target profiling of biologics during safety assessment in drug development. Research and development The human cell microarray tool developed by Retrogenix utilises a library of expression vectors containing open reading frames (ORFs) encoding full-length human plasma membrane proteins, as well as a green fluorescent protein (GFP). Each vector is combined with a lipid and the complexes are spotted in precise locations on specialized slides. Reverse transfection of human cells which are grown on the microarray slides results in over-expression of each membrane protein located over its respective vector spot. Expression of GFP acts as a control to ensure transfection efficiency as well as confirming positioning of the spot co-ordinates. Putative receptor targets are identified by assessing gain-of-binding when a test ligand is applied to the cell microarrays. Further tests determine whether the receptor ‚Äòhit‚Äô is reproducible and to confirm specificity to the test ligand. Currently, more than 4,500 proteins are simultaneously expressed in the cell microarray system for individual screening. The human expression system allows for correct folding and localisation at the surface of the cell and there are documented cases of biological interactions that are mediated by post-translational modifications being detected using the technology. Applications in medical research The cell microarray technology identifies targets and receptors that are important in the understanding of normal biological and disease processes. Diverse ligands can be screened using the technology which has led to the discovery of key receptors for malaria proteins and targets that mediate virus binding to human cells. Target deconvolution Cell microarray screening identifies the receptors for biologic molecules that have been selected through phenotypic screening. Notably, in studies led by Medimmune, the technology identified disease-relevant cell surface antigens of promising phenotypic molecules including the identification of TNFR2 as a potential target for cancer immunotherapy. Off-target profiling Cell microarray off-target profiling assesses the specificity of ligands, either prior to clinical testing or to uncover the mechanism of action for an observed adverse event or an unexpected pharmacokinetic profile.

Biography Louise McNair was born in 1869 in St. Louis, the daughter of Charles A. McNair and Louise Donohoe (d. March 10, 1903), of Glasgow, Missouri. Charles A. McNair (1831-1907) was engaged in the iron business in St. Louis; his children were: Elizabeth McNair (1856-1857), Edwin Alonzo McNair (1858-1914), Emma Belle McNair, Louise McNair. The musician, McNair Ilgenfritz, was Louise McNair's nephew. McNair was a student of Mary Institute, and after graduating there she taught three years in Hosmer Hall, and then attended Wellesley College, class of 1896. At Wellesley she was schoolmate with Sarah Chamberlin Weed and Elizabeth B. Hardee, who killed themselves in a suicide pact at the Laurens' School, the fashionable boarding school for girls they founded in the Fenway district of Boston. Returning to school after her course at Wellesley McNair again taught Mathematics at Hosmer until the death of Martha Matthews, when she accepted the position of principal in 1903. McNair was appointed to be the headmistress of Hosmer Hall where she had previously taught. The school was founded in 1884 by Clara G. Shepard and Martha H. Matthews, and, at a later date, was incorporated under the laws of Missouri. In 1896 Matthews assumed control of the school when it moved to its location at Washington and Pendleton Avenues. Upon the death of Matthews in 1907, the management was transferred to Louise McNair, who was closely identified with the school. Hosmer Hall was founded a few months after Miss Cuthbert's School closed, which was one of the early schools for young girls. The aim of Hosmer Hall was to fit girls for the responsibilities and opportunities of later life and to develop the highest type of American womanhood. Founded at a time when college education for women was in its initial stage, Hosmer Hall laid stress upon fitting its pupils to enter the leading women's colleges. McNair was often asked why should a girl spend time in learning mathematics and Latin in college, studies which they rarely ever put to practical uses. She believed very strongly that those subjects were of value because they gave a fine mental training. McNair believed that school work should be difficult, also that the knowledge gained from mathematics could be obtained in no other way. She believed that a girl could make a better loaf of bread by knowing Latin and mathematics. McNair said that we could start children with was a trained mind then they were prepared for whatever must be done. She believed that children should, in school, have enough work to keep them busy; that while they were attending school their business was to go to school; that if their spare time were spent, as it was before, in learning the lessons of domestic life she could feel different about engrossing most of their time; but when their spare time was spent in going downtown to matinees and picture shows she protested very vigorously. The important thing she wished to do was to train the girls' minds, but let them do their own thinking. She wanted the girls whom she taught to turn out the kind of women who were going to do something with their lives, and that was true of the majority of the alumnae of this school. There were many who were successful ‚Äî Sara Teasdale, Caroline Risque, Zoe Akins, Berenice Wyer ‚Äî were among the notable women in St. Louis. The instructors in Hosmer Hall were all graduates of the leading colleges to meet the standards demanded by the college entrance requirements. It was the policy of Hosmer Hall always to have among the instructors one or two recent graduates from college to keep a diverse range of staff ages. Grace Burnham was the assistant principal, with a degree of Bachelor of Arts from Washington University; Cora L. Swift, French; Alice M. Miller, Latin; H. Carolyn Percy, English, and Florence Elizabeth Lange, German, represented the teachers of languages. Alice M. Hasey, science; E.

This type of fever usually occurs during the course of an infectious disease. Diagnosis of intermittent fever is frequently based on the clinical history but some biological tests like complete blood count and blood culture are also used. In addition radiological investigations like chest X-ray, abdominal ultrasonography can also be used in establishing diagnosis.  Types  Malaria is a common example of intermittent fever and it has following types. = Quotidian fever = Bouts of fever occurs daily (24-hour periodicity) for few hours, typical of Plasmodium knowlesi. = Tertian fever = Fever occurs after an interval of two days (48-hour periodicity), typical of Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium ovale. = Quartan fever = Fever occurs after an interval of three days (72-hour periodicity), typical of Plasmodium malariae.

Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., the Court ruled that the birth control mandate in employee funded health plans was unconstitutional. The case set a precedent for evaluating legal questions relating to religious liberty. Since 2015, ADF has played a role in five victories at the Supreme Court. ADF was founded in 1993 with the stated goal of advocating, training, and funding legal cases on the issues of \\"religious freedom, sanctity of life, and marriage and family.\\"Issues, Alliance Defense Fund In 2012 the organization shifted its mission of funding allied attorneys to direct representation of clients though litigation.

These three inmates‚Äîall cisgender women‚Äîhad complained that being housed with transgender women was \\"cruel and unusual punishment.\\" (ADF dropped the lawsuit in 2019 because these clients were no longer incarcerated, and because they wished to wait for the outcome of other Supreme Court cases about transgender rights.) =2018= *Masterpiece Cakeshop v.

Cochran was fired by Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed, a judge declared inconstitutional the city's preclearance rules on what employees could do on their own time outside work. Atlanta ended up agreeing to pay $1.2 million to Cochran. * Brush & Nib v. City of Phoenix. Two Christian artists who owned a stationery store did not want to make custom wedding invitations for same-sex couples on religious grounds, and wished therefore to have an exemption from a Phoenix, Arizona anti-discrimination ordinance. The artists were represented by ADF. Lower court rulings upheld the city ordinance, but the Arizona Supreme Court ruled in September 2019 that, based on the Arizona Constitution, the ordinance violated the free-speech rights of the artists. The ruling was on narrow factual grounds and pertained only to custom wedding invitations and the artists' right to free speech, and was neither granted them a blanket exemption from the ordinance, nor was it a ruling on whether the law was constitutional. Other businesses which wished to be exempt from the law would need to seek their own court order.

History The first church which stood on the site was built in 1473, and it was enlarged in 1500. It was rebuilt between 1658 and 1688. The present configuration of the building dates back to the 19th century. The church was given to the Carmelites on 12 December 1912, and it became a parish church on 4 September 1918. It is located adjacent to a friary and a school. Ch√¢teau Lonz The church became too small to cater for the town's growing population by the mid-20th century, so a storeroom in Ch√¢teau Lonz began to be used as a temporary church in 1947, and a new parish church began to be built in 1954. The old church remained the parish church until 3 December 1989, while the new church building was still incomplete. In 2017, when some paintings were removed to be sent for restoration, Baroque and Rococo frescoes believed to date back to the 17th century were discovered on the walls.

Construction of the church began on 19 April 1956, to Romanesque Revival designs of ƒ†u≈º√® Damato. After excavation works, the roofing and the balcony were completed by June 1967.

A separate community was established in 1980, and the incomplete building became the parish church on 3 December 1989. The church's interior After Damato's death, the architect Louis A. Naudi was commissioned to continue works, and he was later joined by Godwin Aquilina. The original plan with five altars was deemed unsuitable due to the Second Vatican Council, so it was redesigned by ƒ†u≈ºeppi Galea. The foundation stone was laid on 6 October 1990. Works progressed more rapidly, and the building was opened and blessed by Archbishop Joseph Mercieca on 17 July 2005.

It was one of the first synthetic dyes. The name was a combination of \\"azure\\" and \\"aniline\\". A variant of the name was \\"Azurine\\". The word was introduced as a colour term about the same time as \\"mauve\\" and \\"magenta\\", but it has not survived in the English language. The dye is made from phenol, first oxidising it with oxalic acid and sulfuric acid to make a red substance called rosolic acid. By treating this with ammonia, a dye called red coralline or p√©onine was made. When reacted with aniline, the blue azuline was produced. This was invented by Jules Persoz in Paris. A company in Lyon called Guinon, Marnas & Bonnet bought the process and established a patent. In 1862 azuline was selling for 450 francs per kilogram. Originally in American Dyestuff Reporter vol 81 no 11 Chemists at first did not know the structure of the molecules in the coal tar dyes including azuline. Use of azuline was superseded by aniline blue. Properties As a solid, azuline has a metallic appearance with a copper red colour. It hardly dissolves in water, but does dissolve in alcohol. In alcohol it has a strong blue colour, but still has a red tinge. The dye is colourfast, resisting fading by light. Sulfuric acid solution gives a red solution. Iodine destroys the substance.

Its chief geographical features are mountain streams, waterfalls and a spring well. Aghnacollia is traversed by the R200 road (Ireland), minor public roads and rural lanes. The townland covers 323 statute acres. The local pronunciation is Ahnacarrilla. History In earlier times the townland was probably uninhabited as it consists mainly of bog and poor clay soils. It was not seized by the English during the Plantation of Ulster in 1610 or in the Cromwellian Settlement of the 1660s so some dispossessed Irish families moved there and began to clear and farm the land. The earliest reference to the townland is on a map dated 1813 where it is called Aughnacurralia. In the 19th century the landlord was Lord John Beresford, the Protestant Archbishop of Armagh.

The break of three years instead of two will become a practice, starting from the 2002 edition: the choice is due to the desire not to thicken the calendar too much, allowing the organizers to have more time to prepare the event, now more and more articulated, and to various Christian groups, parishes and associations worldwide to have more summers available.

In the early 1980s, Gianola extended best linear unbiased prediction to the non-linear domain for analysis of categorical traits (fertility, survival, resistance to diseases), using the classical threshold model of Sewall Wright. Subsequently, he pioneered the use of Bayesian methodologies and Monte Carlo Markov chain methods in quantitative genetics. He also revived early work by Sewall Wright on structural equation models and cast their application in the context of modern quantitative genetics and statistical methodology. His group in Wisconsin was the first in the world applying non-parametric methods, such as reproducing Kernel Hilbert spaces regression and Bayesian neural networks, to genome-enabled selection in animal breeding, agriculture and whole-genome (i.e., using a massive number of DNA markers) prediction of complex traits or diseases. Gianola published extensively on thresholds models, Bayesian theory, prediction of complex traits using mixed model methodology, hierarchical Bayesian regression procedures and machine learning techniques. Gianola has been also involved in whole-genome prediction of skin and bladder cancer in humans. He has taught extensively in more than twenty countries including recurrent visiting professorships at the Universidad Politecnica de Valencia (Spain), the Norwegian University of Life Sciences (Norway), Aarhus University (Denmark), Georg-August University (Germany) and the Technical University of Munich (Germany). He has been an Honorary Researcher at the Pasteur Institut de Montevideo since 2016. In an Editorial contained in a volume published in Gianola's honor in the Journal of Animal Breeding and Genetics (2017), it was stated that \\"He is probably the one lecturer in animal breeding and genetics, who has the biggest impact on the largest number of followers in the numerous classes and courses he has taught with never-ending energy all across the world.\\" Education Gianola studied agricultural engineering (Ing. Agr.) at the Universidad de la Republica where he graduated in 1970. He received the MS (1973) and Ph.D. (1975) degrees from the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. C. R. Henderson, developer of mixed linear model methodology and Daniel Gianola, Urbana, 1986. Biography Gianola was born in Montevideo on 16 May 1947. His father, Gorgias Gianola, was an MIT graduate in mechanical engineering as well as a musician; his mother, Alondra Barberia (known as Alondra Alzua), was a producer of television and radio programs in Uruguay. Gianola spent long periods at the family farm in Melo, Uruguay, and his grandfather (Antonio Gianola, the first livestock auctioneer in Uruguay) was influential in his choice of agricultural science as a career. After graduating in agricultural engineering from Universidad de la Republica at 23 years of age, Gianola moved to the USA to pursue postgraduate studies (MS and Ph.D degrees at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1973 and 1975, working with Professors W. J. Tyler and A. B. Chapman, respectively). He also studied for one year at Cornell University, where he was taught by Professors Charles Henderson, L. D. Van Vleck and S. R. Searle. In 1975-1977 he worked for the World Bank as a population and livestock specialist. From 1978 to 1991 he worked as Assistant Professor, Associate Professor (1981) and Professor (1987) in the Department of Animal Sciences at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Gianola became Professor (1991) in the Department of Animal Sciences and Department of Dairy Science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison where he is now Sewall Wright Emeritus Professor of Animal Breeding and Genetics. He was also affiliated with the Department of Biostatistics and Medical Informatics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

S. Amudhan and produced by S. Sashikanth. A sequel to the successful Thamizh Padam (2010), the film stars Shiva, Iswarya Menon, Sathish, and Disha Pandey. The music was composed by Kannan with cinematography by Gopi Amarnath and editing by T. S. Suresh. The film released on 13 July 2018.  Plot  Shiva, the universal cop, has left the police department and has returned to his hometown of Cinemapatti(Shiva's village). He is brought back in to resolve a crisis. Once the situation is handled, he is asked to join the department by Police Commissioner Yezhusaamy, but he refuses and walks away. P, a dreaded don who poses a threat to society, kills Shiva's wife Priya by using a cell phone bomb. Shiva is forced to rejoin the police department. Meanwhile, Shiva is finding a girl to marry on his grandmother's request. His conditions for a girl are that he wants a loosu ponnu (a bubbly but crazy girl). He sees Ramya and assumes that she is crazy since she went into a mental hospital van. With the help of his friends, he proposes to her, and she agrees his love. Shiva learns that P has fixed a bomb somewhere by the clues which were given by P's henchman Wasim Khan. Shiva finds that P has fixed a bomb in a bus. He comes to know that P has fixed the bomb such that if the bus is driven less or more than five kilometers per hour, it will explode. However, Shiva saves the people inside the bus. Wasim is killed by Ritika, P's henchwoman. Shiva then discovers that there was someone in the department who is informing P about their ideas. He discovers and kills Inbashekhar, the mole, and is seemingly suspended. Shiva realizes that Ramya is not crazy but a psychiatrist, and breaks up with her. His friends advise him that he needs to reunite with her. He decides to, but Ramya has left for America. Shiva also goes there to find her, and they reunite in Central Park. Then, it is revealed that Shiva went on a mission in America so that he could catch P, and that he was not suspended. When the mission is in progress, Ramya is kidnapped and killed by P. Back in Chennai, Shiva is very sad about Ramya's death. His grandmother asks him to take her to the cemetery. She took some promises which were to kill P, marry a beautiful girl than Ramya(the girl he loved and which died), and to give her a grandson. Shiva sketches a plan to catch P by demonetising 500 and 1000 rupee notes with the help of the government. He goes to a temple to attend his friend Bharath's marriage. There, he meets Gayathri, a lookalike of Ramya, and gets shocked. He proposes to her in the next two minutes when he sees her. The demonetisation forces P to stand at an ATM queue because he had a lakh crores of 1000 rupee notes. Shiva executes his plan perfectly, but P escapes. Shiva catches him at his Kovalam beach resort. He kills him, but P comes alive and becomes the CM of Tamil Nadu. Bodhi, a saint, calls Shiva and says that P is immortal. The enmity between P and Shiva is for 76 generations. In 300 BC, King Adhiyamaan was ruling Kovai. He appointed Piyaar as the dance teacher of the kingdom, but his dance was demonic. Bharathamuni, another dancer whose dance was divine, wanted to do a dance-off with Piyaar. Adhiyamaan also said that the winner will get a jackfruit, which will give immortality to the one who eats it, and also his daughter Khaleesi will marry him, but Piyaar's henchmen kill Bharathamuni and his grandmother. As a result, Piyaar gets the jackfruit and becomes immortal. Now, Shiva needs to go to 1492 BC to win the dance-off with Piyaar. He gets a time travel watch from a watch mechanic. He goes to 1492 BC, wins the dance-off, Khaleesi, and the jackfruit. He then comes back to 2018, and meets P, who kidnapped Gayathri. He reveals that he ate the jackfruit, and P is no longer immortal. He fights with his henchmen while Gayathri sings. Irritated by her singing, P kills her. Shiva also kills P and is arrested. In the post-credits scene, Shiva is released from prison after 25 years, but his grandmother kills him, showing her villainous \\"D\\" nature, albeit being acquitted in the first film.

During the rendezvous, the captive crew of the British collier North Wales, sunk by Dresden a day earlier, was transferred to Rhakotis.Fayle 1920, pp. 340‚Äì41. On 14 December, Rhakotis arrived at Callao, Peru, where she landed the British crew.Hurd 1921, p. 146. Rhakotis was subsequently interned at Callao, her internment continuing for the next 3 1/2 years. = Seizure and transfer to U.S. control, June 1918 ‚Äì April 1919 = SS Eten in a lock of the Panama Canal, shortly before her conversion to a troopship in 1919 In September 1917, acting on information that the German ships interned in Peruvian waters, including Rhakotis, were being sabotaged by their crews to prevent their possible use by Allied forces, the Peruvian military placed the ships under armed guard, though too late to completely prevent the sabotage.Martin 1925, pp. 403‚Äì06. Peru and Germany severed diplomatic ties a few days later.Martin 1925, pp. 400‚Äì01. By this time, the worldwide wartime shipping shortage had deprived Peru of the tonnage needed to maintain its coastal and international commerce, and in 1918 the Peruvian government decided to seize and utilize the German ships interned in Peruvian ports as a stopgap measure. Lacking both the facilities and the capital to repair the ships, the Peruvian government proposed to charter them to the United States. Under the proposal the U.S. would repair the ships, with the cost of repairs deducted from the charter fee, after which a small percentage of the tonnage would be returned to Peru for its own use, while the US would operate the remaining ships with any resulting profits split on a 50/50 basis. This proposal was accepted by the U.S., and in September 1918 the agreement was effected on a bareboat charter basis,United States War Dept. 1920, p. 4976. with Rhakotis and five other German ships seized by the Peruvians coming under control of the United States Shipping Board (USSB).Martin 1925, pp. 406‚Äì07. On the same day the charter agreement was signed, Rhakotis, along with another ship formerly belonging to the Kosmos Line, Sierra de Cordoba, were taken in tow at Callao by the American tug Culebra for transfer to the American settlement of Balboa, Panama Canal Zone, where the repairs would be effected; three more ex-Kosmos Line ships would later join them. At Balboa, damage to the machinery of the five ships was assessed as serious but not irreparable, with the main and auxiliary engine cylinders and valves having been broken, and the boilers damaged by \\"dry firing\\".Annual Report of the Governor of the Panama Canal 1919, p. 125. Repairs to the five ships took some months, by which time the war was over. However, with the foreign contingent of the American Cruiser and Transport Force having withdrawn at the close of the war, the United States now needed additional ships to repatriate its victorious armies from France, and Rhakotis‚Äîrenamed Eten by the USSB‚Äîbecame one of 56 ships selected for conversion to troop transports.United States War Dept. 1920, pp. 4974‚Äì76. In April, she departed Balboa for conversion work in New York.The Panama Canal Record, p. 488. = U.S. Navy troop transport, April‚ÄìAugust 1919 = Eten was converted to a troop transport at Hoboken, New Jersey, by W. & A. Fletcher Co. between 29 April and 28 May 1919, at a cost of $144,000. On 1 May, while work on the vessel was still in progress, Eten was formally transferred from USSB to Navy control and commissioned the same day as USS Eten (ID-4041), with Lt. Commander O. A. Lustie, USNRF, placed in command. After conversion, USS Eten had a crew complement of 21 officers and 168 men, and a troop carrying capacity of 80 officers and 1,761 enlisted men. Assigned to the Cruiser and Transport Force, USS Eten departed New Jersey the day after the completion of conversion work, 29 May, for St. Nazaire, France, where she embarked U.S. troops. After returning to the United States, a second voyage to France was made, returning 31 July to Newport News, Virginia. A total of 3,296 troops, including 46 sick or wounded, were returned by Eten to the United States on these two round trips. From Newport News, USS Eten departed for Norfolk on 5 May. There on 19 August she was decommissioned and returned to USSB control. = U.S. merchant service, 1919‚Äì21 = Following decommission, SS Eten departed Virginia for New York, arriving 9 September 1919. The vessel was then chartered from the USSB by the United States & Australia Line,United States Shipping Board 1920, p. 128. which intended to use the ship to \\"test the passenger and freight service between South Africa and the Atlantic ports of the United States.\\" After minor repairs, Eten commenced her first voyage for the company, from New York to South Africa, on 9 October. At least three round trips between New York and South Africa were completed by Eten to June 1920, the third of which was to Cape Town. In April of the same year, Australia's Daily Commercial News and Shipping List described Eten as \\"a fine type of the combined passenger and cargo boat. She is very comfortably fitted in all respects. The cabins are spacious, while the drawing, smoking and other lounge rooms suggest that the vessel was originally designed for trade in the tropics.\\" The paper reports that while Eten operators were readily filling the ship's 80 passenger berths, making the South African experiment \\"successful enough to warrant continuance\\", cargoes in both directions had been light, prompting the USSB to consider expanding Eten passenger accommodations from 80 to 360. One factor discouraging such work, however, was the ship's speed of \\"only a little above the old twelve knots an hour.\\" The USSB was also said to be considering purchasing the vessel from the Peruvian government. It is not known whether Eten passenger accommodations were ever expanded as proposed, but Eten was not purchased by the USSB and continued to operate under the Peruvian flag. In November 1920, while returning to New York via South America, a powerful radio \\"of the telephone type\\", capable of transmitting over a one-thousand-mile radius, was discovered hidden in a water tank in cabin 28 of Eten passenger berths. As the Peruvian military had disabled the ship's original radio when first interning the vessel, the discovery led to \\"the obvious conclusion\\" that the German crew may have continued communicating \\"with German sea raiders\\" during the ship's long wartime internment; the U.S. Navy was said to be preparing an investigation into the matter. Eten is known to have been operating on the South Africa‚ÄîNew York route as late as February 1921, but the following year she was returned by the USSB to the Peruvian government. = Peruvian service, 1922‚Äì59 = After taking delivery of Eten from the USSB in 1922, the Peruvian government placed the steamer, renamed SS Rimac, into merchant service with Cia Peruana de Vapores y Dique del Callao, also known as the Peruvian Line. In January 1926, during a period of poor relations between Peru and Chile, a group of 36 Peruvian citizens arriving aboard Rimac at Tacna, Peru‚Äîthen under Chilean control‚Äî were attacked by a Chilean mob. Many of the Peruvians were injured in the resulting mel√©e. On 28 February 1931, Rimac and another steamer, Apurimac, were used to transport troops loyal to Provisional President Luis Miguel S√°nchez Cerro from Lima, Peru, to Mollendo, with the goal of defeating a contingent of rebel troops which had taken control of Arequipa. The loyal troops, led by Lieutenant Colonel Gustavo Jimenez and consisting of a machinegun battalion, a regiment each of cavalry, artillery and infantry and a police battalion, were given an enthusiastic send-off as they entrained at Lima by thousands of locals loyal to the regime. Before the troops were able to reach Arequipa however, Cerro was deposed in a coup on 1 March and the steamers were forced to return to Callao where the soldiers disembarked before marching on Lima and restoring Cerro to power on the 6th. In 1934, Rimac was transferred to the Peruvian Navy for use as a transport. In January 1936, Rimac responded to an SOS from the Chilean steamer Cautin, which had run aground at Lobos de Tierra. By the time Rimac arrived, however, most of Cautins passengers and crew had already been transferred to the American steamer Chimu. On 18 February 1939, Peruvian President Oscar R. Benavides departed Callao in Rimac, bound for a vacation in Pisca. Shortly after, General Antonio Rodriguez, Perus Minister of Interior and a leader of the fascist Uni√≥n Revolucionaria party, attempted with a small group of supporters to seize the Government Palace, declaring himself President in the process. Rimac was quickly ordered to return to Callao, with President Benavides sending a message from the ship denouncing the \\"cowards\\" involved in the coup attempt. Unknown to Benavides, the coup had already been crushed by troops loyal to the government, with five persons including Rodriguez himself having been shot and killed and several others wounded in skirmishing. In the aftermath of the attempted coup, remaining leaders of Uni√≥n Revolucionaria and other suspects were rounded up and jailed pending further investigation. Rimac remained in Navy service until 1948, when she was returned to the government. In 1950, she was transferred to the Peruvian Ministry of Marine.Bonsor 1979, p. 947. She was broken up by Miyachi Salvage KK, Sakai, Japan, on 20 August 1959.

The ship later went into merchant service as a freighter, and during World War II took part in a number of transatlantic convoys. Built in 1918, Santa Olivia was acquired by the Navy on completion, and during the war made two voyages to France as a cargo ship. After the war, she was converted into a troop transport, and repatriated almost 7,500 U.S. troops in four round trips in 1919. A teenage Humphrey Bogart served aboard Santa Olivia in this period. Decommissioned from the Navy, Santa Olivia entered merchant service for W. R. Grace & Co. in late 1919 as the freighter SS Santa Olivia, operating between the United States and South America. In 1922, the vessel was transferred to the Pacific Mail Steamship Company and used in United States intercoastal service. In 1925, Santa Olivia was sold to the American Hawaiian Steamship Company. Renamed SS Kansan, the ship remained in intercoastal service into the 1930s. During World War II, Kansan transported aircraft, explosives and other vital supplies in convoy to the United Kingdom during the Battle of the Atlantic. After the war, Kansan was sold to a Panamanian company and renamed SS Jackstar. Jackstar survived bombardment by Arab forces while unloading cargoes at Tel Aviv, Israel during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The ship was sold for scrap in 1954.

Service history = U.S. Navy service = On 1 July 1918, Santa Olivia was acquired by the Navy and commissioned at Philadelphia as USS Santa Olivia (SP-3125), with Lieutenant Commander George H. Miles, USNRF, placed in command. The return of U.S. troops aboard Santa Olivia was front page news in the Altoona Tribune, 15 May 1919 Santa Olivia was assigned to the Naval Overseas Transportation Service (NOTS) upon commissioning. Departing from Philadelphia on 15 July 1918 for New York, the ship made two round-trip voyages to Europe before the war's end on 11 November 1918. Sailing from New York each time, she carried a total of 10,773 tons of general cargo to Marseilles. With the war over, the foreign contingent of the American Cruiser and Transport Force withdrew, obliging the U.S. Navy to undertake a rapid expansion of its fleet of troop transports in order to quickly repatriate U.S. forces from France. A total of 56 ships were selected for conversion to troopships,United States Department of War 1920. pp. 4974-75. including Santa Olivia. Santa Olivia was detached from NOTS on 20 December 1918 and recommissioned as a troop transport the same day.United States Department of War 1920. p. 4978. Between 26 December 1918 and 14 February 1919, Santa Olivia was converted to a troop transport by the W. & A. Fletcher Company of Hoboken, New Jersey, at a cost of $150,778. After conversion, the ship had a troop capacity of 32 officers and 1,825 enlisted men, and a crew complement of 21 officers and 168 enlisted men.United States Department of Commerce 1920. p. 492. Reassigned to the Cruiser and Transport Force, Atlantic Fleet, Santa Olivia embarked on the first of four troop transport missions between the U.S. and France on 16 February 1919, departing New York for Brest, the return voyage being made from 18 to 30 March. Her second such voyage to France returned to Philadelphia on 12 May, with 30 officers and 1,825 men of the 110th Infantry Regiment and three officers of the 178th Machinegun Detachment. The 110th Infantry was described as \\"the hardest hit of the National Guard regiments\\", having lost 500 killed and 3,000 wounded in the war. Returning to France, Santa Olivia sailed from Bordeaux on May 30 with 1,891 troops, including 16 officers and 429 men of C and D companies, 303rd Engineers, 78th Division, arriving New York 10 June. Santa Olivias final round trip to France for the navy began with a departure from New York on 15 June. At Bordeaux, Santa Olivia embarked another 45 officers and 1,814 men, returning them to New York on 9 July. During this voyage, the ship experienced some rough weather causing a planned onboard Fourth of July celebration to be postponed until the 6th, while two soldiers and one sailor were confined after showing \\"signs of insanity\\"; the three men were later transferred to a military hospital for observation. Santa Olivia was the last U.S. troopship to depart from Bordeaux, the port subsequently being abandoned as a U.S Navy embarkation point in favor of Brest. In her four troop repatriation missions, Santa Olivia returned a total of 7,491 officers and men to the United States, including 14 sick or wounded.Gleaves 1921. pp. 260-61. On 21 July, Santa Olivia was decommissioned at the Grace Line Pier, Brooklyn, and returned the same day to her owner, W. R. Grace & Co. A teenage Humphrey Bogart served on USS Santa Olivia in 1919 as a coxswain. After being transferred from in February, Bogart missed an April sailing of Santa Olivia, but avoided being listed as a deserter by reporting for duty within hours. He was given three days' solitary confinement on bread and water for going AWOL, but the incident did not affect his service record. After returning to the ship, he was honorably discharged on 18 June 1919 with high marks for proficiency and sobriety.Meyers 1997. Chapter 1. Santa Olivias commander during her naval service, George H. Miles, would later run afoul of the law. In 1922, while captain of SS President Van Buren, Miles was charged with murder for beating a deranged pantryman, who died the following day. Convicted of \\"inhumane treatment\\", Miles was sentenced to 18 months jail over the incident and lost his masters licence. In February 1923, while out on bail pending an appeal of his conviction, Miles was arrested for alleged bootlegging. In 1930, Miles was again arrested by police, for attempted burglary. = Merchant service = 1920s‚Äì1930s  After her naval decommission, Santa Olivia entered merchant service on or before September 1919 as a cargo ship for W. R. Grace & Co., under the name SS Santa Olivia. For the next few years, the ship operated between New York and various ports in South America, including Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Valparaiso, Chile; and Callao, Peru. In August 1920, Santa Olivia collided with and sank a tug at Callao, with the freighter suffering minor damage. In July‚ÄìAugust 1922, Santa Olivia delivered 3,500 tons of grain to Reval (modern day Tallinn), Estonia, as part of a relief mission to famine-stricken regions of Russia. In October 1922, the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, a subsidiary of W. R. Grace, announced the formation of a new freight-and-passenger service to run between the East and West coasts of the United States. The service, which operated on a ten-day schedule, was provided by a fleet of seven ships including Santa Olivia. Ports of call eventually added to the service on the West Coast included Tacoma, Washington and Oakland and San Francisco, California, while those on the East Coast included New York, Philadelphia and Baltimore and Norfolk, Virginia. Santa Olivia was to remain in intercoastal service with Pacific Mail for some 2 1/2 years. During this time, her cargoes outbound from New York were miscellaneous; on a November 1922 passage to San Francisco, for example, the ship carried cement, rope, ink, lime juice, dates, canned corn and drugs. Return cargoes included copper and lumber. Due to falling demand, Pacific Mail reduced its intercoastal schedule in October 1924 from one sailing every ten days to one every two weeks. On 11 June 1925, W. R. Grace & Co. sold the six freighters of the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, including Santa Olivia, to the American-Hawaiian Steamship Company. Pacific Mails other ships were sold to the Dollar Line, and the formers remaining assets purchased by Grace. The deal brought to a formal end the existence of Pacific Mail, one of Americas oldest and best known steamship lines, established in 1848. Acquisition of the Pacific Mail freighters allowed American-Hawaiian to expand its intercoastal service, and Santa Olivia was thus retained on her existing route; with the change of ownership, however, the ship was renamed SS Kansan. By late 1925, Kansan was shipping auto parts and general goods from the East to the West Coasts. Return cargoes included dried fruit and canned goods. On 25 June 1926, Kansan grounded on a mudbank at Oakland, but was hauled off with no apparent damage by a tug. By 1930, the ship was engaged in the transport of cotton and wool from New York to European ports such as Bremen, Germany and Liverpool, England. In July 1938, Kansan was engaged in a mercy dash to San Diego after one of her crew was taken sick; during this trip, the ship recorded a speed in one 24-hour period of , completing the passage from Guatemala in 9 days 54 minutes, just short of the record.  World War II  During World War II, Kansan remained under the ownership of American- Hawaiian. After Americas entry into the war in December 1941, Kansan joined the convoy system, making several transatlantic trips from the U.S. to Great Britain during the Battle of the Atlantic. (Enter \\"Kansan\\" (without quotes) in ship search field for an interactive list of convoys which included the ship.) Kansans movements in the early part of the war are uncertain, but the ship is known to have voyaged from Hampton Roads, Virginia to Trinidad in mid-1942. On 14 March 1943, Kansan departed New York for various destinations including Bandar Abbas, Iran, and Bombay, India, before returning to New York 9 October; her cargoes in this period are not known. On 13 November 1943, Kansan departed New York with a cargo of explosives and general goods bound for Liverpool, England, with convoy HX266, arriving Liverpool on the 27th. Returning to New York with convoy ON215 on 28 December, Kansan departed New York for Liverpool a second time on 22 January 1944 with convoy HX276, this time with a cargo of general goods and aircraft, arriving 7 February. After returning to New York with convoy ON226 between 29 February and 15 March, Kansan travelled to Boston, Massachusetts and Halifax, Nova Scotia, to pick up general cargoes bound for England before returning to New York 11 April. Kansan departed for her third and final wartime transatlantic crossing from New York to Liverpool with convoy HX287 on 14 April, arriving on the 26th. After returning to New York with ON236 from 12 to 27 May, Kansan relocated over the next few weeks from New York to Guantanamo, Cuba, and Cristobal, Panama. Her subsequent wartime movements are not known.  Postwar service  In 1946, Kansan was sold to the Star Line of Panama and renamed SS Jackstar. On 12 July 1948, Jackstar arrived off Tel Aviv in the fledgling state of Israel during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. Jackstar spent the next six days unloading her cargo of flour in spite of intermittent bombardment by Arab forces. Jackstar was undamaged during the operation. The ship made a second voyage to Israel, from New York to Haifa, with eight passengers and general cargoes in February 1950. Jackstar was scrapped at La Spezia, Italy, In December 1954.

As a two-year-old she was one of the best fillies of her generation in England when she won five of her eight races. In the following year she finished third in the 1000 Guineas before going on to win the Epsom Oaks, Coronation Stakes and Nassau Stakes, as well as three other races. She earned more money than any other horse in Britain in 1924 and was retired after winning eight of her sister races. Straitlace was exported to France in 1925 and became a very successful and influential broodmare. Background Straitlace was a small, but \\"beautifully proportioned\\" bay mare with a white star bred at the Sledmere Stud in East Yorkshire by Lady Sykes. As a yearling she was offered for sale and bought for 2,100 guineas by the newspaper proprietor Edward Hulton. The filly was sent into training with Dawson Waugh (trainer of Tagalie) at his Somerville Lodge stable at Newmarket, Suffolk. She was sired by Son-in-Law, a top-class stayer, whose wins included the Goodwood Cup, Jockey Club Cup and Cesarewitch. Straitlace's dam Stolen Kiss was a very successful sprinter who won nineteen races including the Portland Handicap in 1911. Her other foals included Kiss Again, a mare whose female-line descendants have included Henbit, Dancing Brave, Jolypha, Delta Blues and Lucky Debonair. Racing career=1923: two-year-old season= Straitlace ran consistently against good competition as a two-year-old in 1923,recording five wins, two seconds and one third place from eight starts. After finishing second to Mumtaz Mahal (also bred at Sledmere) at Newmarket Racecourse in May she won the Stud Produce Stakes at Sandown Park, the Great Surrey Foal Plate at Epsom Racecourse, the Exeter Stakes at Newmarket, a Rous Memorial Stakes at Goodwood and the Autumn Breeders' Foal Plate at Manchester. At Newmarket in October she finished second to Chronometer in the Cheveley Park Stakes. On her only other appearance she finished third to Eatonwick and Heverswool in a Rous Memorial Stakes at Newmarket. By the end of the year she had earned at least ¬£6,175 in prize money. =1924: three-year-old season= On 9 May 1924, Straitlace was one of sixteen fillies to contest the Rowley Mile course at Newmarket Racecourse and finished third behind Plack and Mumtaz Mahal, beaten two lengths by the winner. At Epsom on 6 of June, Straitlace faced a rematch with Plack in the 146th running of the Oaks Stakes. Thecontest was run in fine weather but attracted a smaller than usual crown, with many racegoers reportedly being discouraged by the appalling conditions which had prevailed for the Epsom Derby two days earlier. Ridden by Frank O'Neill, she started at odds of 100/30 second favourite in a twelve-runner field. Straitlace tracked Plack in the early stages before overtaking her rival approaching the straight and then opening up a clear advantage. She won by one and a half lengths from Plack with the fast-finishing Mink a head away in third place. At Royal Ascot in June Straitlace was brought back in distance for the Coronation Stakes over one mile in which he was ridden by Charlie Elliott and won at odds of 3/1, \\"in the style of a really good filly\\". At Goodwood, with Elliott again in the saddle she started 4/9 favourite and won the Nassau Stakes over ten furlongs. The runner-up on this occasion was the Aga Khan's four-year-old Charley's Mount, who went on to win the Cesarewitch later that year. She won three other races in 1924 and was retired at the end of the season having earned ¬£17,965, making her the most financially successful horse in Britain that year. Assessment and honours In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Straitlace an \\"average\\" winner of the Oaks. Breeding record Straitlace was retired from racing to become a broodmare. After Edward Hulton's death in 1925 the mare was sold for 17,000 guineas by Edward Esmond. She was exported to France where she spent the rest of her life. Her foals included: *Necklace, a bay filly, foaled in 1926, sired by Lemberg. Won Prix Morny.

He works as an associate professor at the American University in Cairo and Mansoura University. Sallam led the discovery and description of Mansourasaurus shahinae, a species of sauropod dinosaur from Egypt, which has improved understanding of the prehistory of Africa during the latest Cretaceous period. His work has helped popularize paleontology in Egypt. Biography Hesham Sallam was born in 1975 in Sharkia, Egypt. He received a bachelor's degree in geology from Mansoura University in 1997. He was a visiting scholar at Stony Brook University from 2008 to 2010, during which time he began planning what would become the MUVP. He received his Ph.D. from the University of Oxford in 2010, which made him the first Egyptian to have earned a doctorate in vertebrate paleontology in several decades. After completing his Ph.D., he returned to Egypt, where he became a professor at Mansoura University and founded the MUVP. Sallam is an associate professor at the American University in Cairo and Mansoura University. Voice of America report about the discovery of Mansourasaurus, with interview of Sallam In December 2013, Sallam and several graduate students found the partial skeleton of a dinosaur at the Dakhla Oasis in the Western Desert of Egypt. In February 2014 they returned to the site to excavate the specimen, which took 21 days. Sallam led a team of Egyptian and American paleontologists in describing the specimen, which was announced as belonging to a new species of sauropod, Mansourasaurus shahinae, in January 2018. The holotype specimen of Mansourasaurus is the most complete fossil of a terrestrial animal from the post-Cenomanian Cretaceous in mainland Africa, a period of nearly 30 million years which otherwise has a poorly-known fossil record in Africa. Mansourasaurus is closely related to European species, providing evidence that Africa was not entirely geographically isolated during the Late Cretaceous. The discovery attracted considerable media attention and has helped popularize paleontology in Egypt. Sallam has been described as one of the most significant paleontologists in the Middle East. The MUVP is the first Middle Eastern research program dedicated to vertebrate paleontology. While fossils have been found in Egypt for over a century, prior to Sallam's founding of the MUVP, vertebrate paleontology research in Egypt was primarily conducted by foreigners. Sallam hopes to change that, using the MUVP both for public outreach and training the next generation of Egyptian vertebrate paleontologists. One of Sallam's students, Sanaa El-Sayed, is the first woman from the Middle East to have been the lead author on an internationally- published vertebrate paleontology research paper.

It lies in the Roman Catholic parish of Corlough and barony of Tullyhaw.Altachullion Lower Looking north from the R200 road. Geography Altachullion Lower is bounded on the north by Altbrean townland, on the south by Altachullion Upper townland, on the west by Legnaderk and Aghnacollia townlands and on the east by Altinure townland. Its chief geographical features are forestry plantations, mountain streams and waterfalls. Altachullion Lower is traversed by the R200 road (Ireland), the L1019 public road and rural lanes. The townland covers 276 statute acres. History In earlier times the townland was probably uninhabited as it consists mainly of bog and poor clay soils. It was not seized by the English during the Plantation of Ulster in 1610 or in the Cromwellian Settlement of the 1660s so some dispossessed Irish families moved there and began to clear and farm the land. The earliest reference to the townland is on a map dated 1813 where it is called Altaghullen. In the 19th century the landlord was Lord John Beresford, the Protestant Archbishop of Armagh. The muddled land history of the area prior to this is described in the 1838 Exchequer case, \\"Attorney General of Ireland v The Lord Primate\\". The maps used in the case are viewable online at- The Tithe Applotment Books for 1826 list eight tithepayers in the townland.Tithe Applotment Books 1826 The Ordnance Survey Name Books for 1836 give the following description of the townland- The soil is light being intermixed with sandstone and the general produce are oats, rye, potatoes & flax. This townland pays no cess as it is considered a track of mountain. The Altachullion Lower Valuation Office Field books are available for August 1839. In 1841 the population of the townland was 40, being 22 males and 18 females. There were five houses in the townland, all of which were inhabited. In 1851 the population of the townland was 53, being 27 males and 26 females. There were ten houses in the townland and all were inhabited. Griffith's Valuation of 1857 lists twenty landholders in the townland.  Griffith's Valuation In 1861 the population of the townland was 57, being 29 males and 28 females. There were ten houses in the townland and one was uninhabited. In 1871 the population of the townland was 31, being 14 males and 17 females. There were seven houses in the townland, all were inhabited. In 1881 the population of the townland was 52, being 30 males and 22 females. There were eleven houses in the townland, of which one was uninhabited. In 1891 the population of the townland was 53, being 28 males and 25 females. There were nine houses in the townland, all were inhabited. In the 1901 census of Ireland, there are ten families listed in the townland.Census of Ireland 1901 In the 1911 census of Ireland, there are eleven families listed in the townland.Census of Ireland 1911 Antiquities The chief structures of historical interest in the townland are # Maguire‚Äôs Chair situate at Blackrocks Cross. The book Bawnboy and Templeport by Chris Maguire states- Maguire's Chair is the name given to a great rock formation along the road which leads from Bawnboy to Glangevlin. It is in the townland of Altachullion about four perch from where the road from Swanlinbar joins the main road. There's an old tradition about how it got its name. This is the story. Once when there was a war on between the Magauran and Maguire Clans, Maguire marched with his men along the mountains and called a halt at this place. The army had lunch there, the clansmen sitting on the rocks all around while the Maguire Chief sat on the large rock. Hence the name Maguire's Chair. Cavan Museum states- About 4 miles from Glangevlin stands a large glacial erratic known as ‚ÄòMaguire‚Äôs Chair‚Äô. Various stories are told about its name; one story claims that the stone was where the chief of the Maguire clan was inaugurated in medieval times. Another tale tells of a time also during the medieval period when Maguire sat in judgement here in a dispute between the McGoverns and the O‚ÄôRourkes of Leitrim. During the Penal Laws, the spot was used as a lookout point to warn priests saying mass. It was also a popular spot for dancing and games playing on the last Sunday of July or the first Sunday of August, called Donagh Sunday, Bilberry Sunday or the Festival of Lughnasadh. # The site of an old school near Barney Reilly's.

The incident is one of Australia's most controversial shootings by police.  Death  On the morning of 28 June 1997, Roni Levi was surrounded by six NSW Police Officers after being found walking at Bondi Beach with a knife. Levi, who had been diagnosed as mentally ill, spent the previous evening at St Vincent‚Äôs Hospital, after suffering a delusional episode. After a 25-minute standoff two of the police officers, Constable Rodney Podesta and Senior Constable Anthony Dilorenzo, shot Roni Levi four times. Levi, who died from his wounds soon after, was 33 years old. In statements given on the day of the shooting, Podesta and Dilorenzo reported that Levi had lunged at them with the knife, and was a potential threat to spectators on the promenade. At the time of the shooting, both Podesta and Dilorenzo were the subject of covert internal affairs investigations; one concerning Podesta's suspected sale of drugs, and another concerning Dilorenzo's associations with known drug suppliers. Neither Podesta or Dilorenzo were subjected to drug or alcohol testing after the shooting.  Photographs of Levi's death  Photographs showing the moments leading up to, and directly after, the shooting were captured by a passing professional photographer, Jean Pierre Bratanoff-Firgoff. The photographs, which showed Levi standing at some distance from police officers, appeared to contradict the statements made by Podesta and Dilorenzo; specifically that Levi had threatened police by lunging at them. Both police officers were unaware the photographs were taken at time of giving their statements. The next day, Jean Pierre Bratanoff-Firgoff's photographs of the incident were published in the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper, and were subsequently distributed internationally.  Aftermath  The death of Roni Levi was the subject of a highly publicised coronial inquiry. In his March 1998 report, the State Coroner, Derick Hand, recommended changes in police procedure, and that police involved in shootings should be subject to immediate, and mandatory drug and alcohol testing. In June 1998, the Department of Public Prosecutions concluded that there was no reasonable prospect of conviction of either officer, Podesta or Dilorenzo. After a public campaign, lead by Levi‚Äôs estranged widow, the case was reopened. Three Police Integrity Commission hearings were held over eighteen months, in which Jean Pierre Bratanoff-Firgoff's photographs of the incident were used as evidence. While both officers continued to deny any wrongdoing, Podesta resigned in March 1998 and the following year was found guilty of supplying cocaine. Dilorenzo was later sacked from the NSW Police Service in June 1999 as a result of his involvement with known drug dealers. Bratanoff-Firgoff's photographs of the incident have become iconic, and have been described as \\"culturally emblematic signifiers\\" of critical incidents between police and the mentally ill. In 2007, the State Library of New South Wales purchased the photographs, on behalf of the people of New South Wales.

It runs in a south-north direction between Kurf√ºrstenplatz and Petuelpark, where it merges into Knorrstra√üe. The street was named after the Serbian capital Belgrade.  Today's appearance  The southern part of Belgradstra√üe is characterized by Neo-Renaissance and Art Nouveau buildings from around 1900. Overall, the Bavarian State Office for Monument Protection lists seventeen historical buildings on the Belgradstra√üe, from Kaiserstra√üe to the Unertlstra√üe the road runs along the protected building complex, Nordschwabing (E-1-62-000-42). The northern part of Belgradstra√üe, starting from the Scheidplatz, is dominated in the west by Luitpoldpark and Bad Georgenschwaige. At the corner of Belgradstra√üe to Parzivalstra√üe is the \\"ladies club on Luitpoldpark\\", founded in 1862 by King Maximilian II of Bavaria, which moved in 1956 from the bombed Dragon Castle to the current premises. The northern end of Belgradstra√üe is formed by the Nymphenburg- Biedersteiner Canal and the Petuelpark.  Traffic  Since 1959 the Munich tram has been operating on Belgradstra√üe, from Kurf√ºrstenplatz to Scheidplatz, and from 1963 to 1993 the northern part of Belgradstra√üe was also used by the tram, connecting to the settlement Am Hart. There is still evidence of the route today, a green strip can be seen where the tracks separate between Scheidplatz and Petuelpark.  History  The course of Belgradstra√üe follows the northern part of the T√ºrkengraben, built in 1702-1704 as a connecting channel from the Nymphenburg-Biedersteiner canal to Munich Residenz and was refilled in 1811 again. In 1764, the Schwaige St. Georgenschwaige (1568 St. Georgen, 1620 at St. Georgen) was first named at the junction of the Turkish moat and canal. In 1826, an open-air swimming pool was opened here and a restaurant was built in the former bleach house, the so-called \\"Dutch bleach\\". In 1850, it was renamed by the owner and became the \\"Bad Georgenschwaige\\". In 1850, it was announced in Munich Tagblatt that a license was granted to a Lohnkutscher for passenger trips by horsebusses to Georgenschweige. Until the incorporation of the district of Schwabing, in 1890, to Munich, the city limit boundary was around Munich, at the height of the later Kurf√ºrstenplatz. In the plan of the royal capital and residence city of Munich from 1858/59, the Belgradstra√üe is marked as \\"leading to Georgenschwaig\\" and apart from a few buildings on the later Kurf√ºrstenplatz, still completely undeveloped. The city of Munich wrote out a competition for the expansion of the city and in 1892 began a construction boom according to a development plan by Theodor Fischer. In the first third of the 20th century, the then Belgradstra√üe 57 (1903-1936), with the \\"Pension F√ºrmann\\" was also a culmination of the Schwabinger Boh√®me. After 1936, the house number was changed to 61. The Swiss Heinrich F√ºrmann (* 1870, ‚Ä† 1936), operated the pension together with his wife Luise (Lulu), in a converted horse stable. Guests often stayed more than a year, often rent was deferred, food and drink costed almost nothing. As such, the pension attracted artists from all over the world. Ren√© Pr√©vot lived for some time in the popular guesthouse, and in his room Ricarda Huch previously lived there. Ernst Zeno Ichenh√§user grew up in the house of the pension F√ºrmann. Stefan George lived with his most important son, Friedrich Gundolf, in the gable room of a gardener's house belonging to pension F√ºrmann, from March 1903 and there he was visited by Maximilian Kronberger. Else Lasker-Sch√ºler and also Franz Jung with his wife Margot were there. Friedrich Georg J√ºnger followed his resident friend Alexander Mitscherlich, who in turn got to know the two-year-old medical student Melitta Behr there. The latter was later known as Melitta Mitscherlich. Ernst Moritz Engert was a regular guest there, as well as Gustav Wyneken, who lived there with Elisabeth Salomon (later known as Elisabeth Gundolf). The Munich Police Directorate wrote in 1914 about the \\"famous because of their free intercourse pension\\", that their owners are \\"aware of the polices' sharp observation.\\" Karl Wolfskehl, on the other hand, dedicated his poem to F√ºrmann,\\"Vater der Fahrenden\\". The often assigned to the George- Kreis, \\"Schwabinger scandal Countess\\" Fanny zu Reventlow moved in 1901 temporarily into Belgradstra√üe.

He is the recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship and a New York Foundation for the Arts Grant.  Education and work  Wiener attended Brown University and the University of California, Berkeley (B.A. 1977) as well as the Whitney Museum Independent Study Program (1982-1983). Since the early 1980s Wiener has been known for his multicolored, multi-textured sculptures that straddle the abstract and the representational. Blake Gopnik remarked that, \\"Wiener‚Äôs work escapes being just another instance of formalist abstraction. It seems deeply immersed in real-world materials and forms, as works linked to 'low' craft often do.\\".Blake Gopnik. A Mess of Art, Daniel Wiener makes epoxy wonders. The Daily Beast. March 24, 2011. Early on in his career Wiener showed a deftness for texture, for example making hard elements appear soft, or vice versa, which in turn played with the viewers' tactile responses to the work.Alan Artner. Construction Carries These Kitschy Works. The Chicago Tribune. January 24, 1992. Early forms, though not quite representational, were neither fully abstract. An early review by David Pagel in Artforum describes, \\"A loopy parade of pre-oedipal playthings surrounded the visitor to Daniel Wiener‚Äôs jam-packed exhibition of unnameable sculptural objects.\\"David Pagel. Daniel Wiener. Artforum. January 1993. Over the years, Wiener's amorphic objects inched towards becoming more 'nameable' ones, as they began adopting more anthropomorphic or utilitarian qualities. Of this shift Kathleen Whitney noted, \\"The small, almost figurative details in his current imagery represent an evolution from his previous work, which was always referential, psychological, and biomorphic in nature.\\"Kathleen Whitney. Daniel Wiener: Trojan Horses. Sculpture Magazine. June 2015. Such consistent qualities have also drawn comparisons to the work of Claes Oldenburg,Douglas Manson. Reviews: Daniel Weiner. Art in America. August 2011. Jean DubuffetRoberta Smith. Daniel Wiener: ‚ÄòKooks and Villains‚Äô. The New York Times. May 30, 2015. and Mike Kelley. Wiener's primary material is Apoxie- Sculpt, a resin that, that sets into a claylike texture and preserves the saturated, wet look of acrylic paint. In a 2015 review in The New York Times of his exhibition Kooks and Villains at Lesley Heller Gallery, critic Roberta Smith stated that, \\"This veteran sculptor excels at manipulating [the] malleable material.\\" Made up of both freestanding furniture-referencing objects and wall reliefs faces, the works in the exhibition showed Wiener's ability to generate a great variety of forms from the same material starting point. In addition to sculpture, Wiener's practice also includes ink drawings, watercolors, and animations. His works on paper- which possess many of the color qualities found in his sculptures- address how color may dictate shape, prompting one critic to state that, \\"Daniel Wiener is in essence a painter‚Äôs sculptor.\\"Alexander Ross. Daniel Weiner. Bomb Magazine. Spring 2012.  Exhibitions  Wiener has exhibited nationally and internationally with solo exhibitions at Lesley Heller Gallery, New York, NY; Acme Gallery, Santa Monica, CA; Holly Solomon Gallery, New York, NY; Germans Van Eck Gallery, New York, NY; The McKinney Avenue Contemporary, Dallas, TX; Feigen Gallery, Chicago, IL; Vadstrup & Bie, Copenhagen, Denmark; and Barbara Farber, Amsterdam, Holland; among others.

Based in the town of Selby, its remit covered the Selby District of North Yorkshire in England, with a population of 83,449 at the 2011 Census. Selby and District DIAL was founded on 1 July 1988 and opened after volunteer training around May 1989. Its registered charity number was 1058185. Initially the charity was run entirely by volunteers. Later, with the aid of lottery, council and other funding, it was able to move into larger premises, take on more volunteers, employ paid staff, and expand its services. Due to a lack of funding, DIAL had to close its offices at the end of March 2018, and the trustees began the task of officially winding up the charity which was completed on 5 March 2019. History Originally named Selby and District Disability Information and Advice Line (D.I.A.L.), the charity at first operated as a part-time telephone helpline, staffed entirely by volunteers. On 16 November 2001, Selby and District DIAL received ¬£219,273 in funding from the National Lottery's Community Fund. This three-year award made it possible for DIAL to move in 2002 into larger premises at 12 Park Street, Selby where they set up a \\"one stop shop\\" for people with disabilities, and a display area for aids and equipment. In September 2010 ‚Äì after a major funding crisis ‚Äì the charity received a further major five-year funding boost of ¬£344,445 from the Big Lottery Fund. This funding enabled Selby and District DIAL to take on paid staff and expand its services to include welfare rights advice, form-filling, benefit checks, representation at tribunal, home visits, outreach sessions, activity and support groups, signposting to other agencies, information, and short-term wheelchair hire. In April 2015, an application for a grant of ¬£12,661.77 from Selby Town Council ‚Äì seeking continued funding for a specialist disability welfare rights advisor ‚Äì reported that \\"The funding of this post during 2014 enabled ¬£2,121,108.98 of previously unclaimed benefits to be secured for disabled people in Selby District and in excess of ¬£1,000,000 of this was secured for people within Selby Town area.\\" In January 2018, two years after their Big Lottery money ran out, it was announced that due to a lack of funding, Selby and District DIAL would have to close by the end of March 2018. The service would instead become a project of Age UK Selby District, operating a part-time telephone help line, with form-filling being carried out over the phone and through home visits. Due to Age UK's constitution, the service would also only be able to help clients aged fifty years or over, and others would be signposted to organisations such as Citizens Advice which would be able to help. The future of its Disability Awareness project, which it ran in local schools and would require a new home, was uncertain at this point. Selby and District DIAL has now been officially wound-up and was removed from the Charity Commission's register on 5 March 2019 as it had ceased to exist.

Recorded and released in 1984, it included the novelty single \\"88 Lines About 44 Women,\\" which entered the Billboard Dance Club Songs chart, and placed at number 208 on the US Pop Albums Sales chart. It is retrospectively held in high regard by critics. Background and release In 1984, The Nails signed with RCA for their major-label debut album. The album was recorded the same year at three New York studios: the Boogie Hotel, Electric Lady, and Skyline Studios. The album followed the group's independently-released EP, Hotel for Women, released in early 1981 and featuring three versions of the group's breakout single, \\"88 Lines About 44 Women,\\" which was again included on Mood Swing in a slightly altered form. The album was produced by Greg Winter. The group was shown in a December 1984 issue of Billboard, \\"putting the finishing touches\\" on the album. The album was originally released in late 1984, by RCA Records. In 2007, a re-mastered edition of the album was released by CD Baby, and in 2012, another re-release was issued by CityBeat. These versions included two additional tracks: extended remixes of \\"88 Lines About 44 Women\\" and \\"Let It All Hang Out.\\" Reception=Critical= In a retrospective review for AllMusic, critic Richard Foss deemed Mood Swing an \\"album pick\\" of the group's discography. He awarded it 4 and a half stars out of 5 and went on to praise it as \\"a remarkably consistent and confident debut,\\" comparing the music to that of The Damned, Jim Carroll, and Stan Ridgway and praising the lyrics' irony. =Commercial= Upon its release, the album attained modest commercial success. In March 1985, it appeared on Billboard Magazine's list of \\"Bubbling Under\\" albums, at number 208. The album failed to enter the Billboard Hot 200 album sales chart; however, they later managed to with their next record, Dangerous Dreams, in 1986. \\"88 Lines of 44 Women,\\" originally featured on Hotel for Women but re-recorded for Mood Swing, became a hit on MTV and peaked at number 46 on the Billboard Dance Club Songs chart in April 1985.

The standard is recognized globally by the cosmetic industry. By adhering to specific guidelines, cosmetics marketers can use COSMOS signatures, which are registered trademarks, on packaging to confirm the products meet minimum industry requirements to be considered organic or natural. History In 2002 five European organisations responsible for setting organic and natural cosmetics standards met at a trade show to share ideas for broader standards to be used globally. These five COSMOS members are: * BDIH (Germany) * Cosmebio (France) * Ecocert Greenlife SAS (France) * ICEA (Italy) * Soil Association (Great Britain) Over 1,600 manufacturers who sell over 25,000 products across over 45 countries follow the standard, according to Cosmos-standard.org. About 85% of the certified cosmetics industry uses COSMOS signatures on its products. Although the five members differed on certain standards separately, they were able to smooth out differences to create a harmonised international standard that was first published in 2010. At this time the five members formed a non-profit international association overseeing the standard. In June 2010 the COSMOS- standard AISBL was awarded Royal Assent from Belgian authorities. The documents published with the standard include: * The Control Manual: describes how the control systems works * The Labeling Rules: explains how to use COSMOS labels * The Technical Guide: additional information Certification and Labeling Process There are four main certification signatures that comprise the COSMOS-standard, which are for ORGANIC, NATURAL, COSMOS CERTIFIED and COSMOS APPROVED products. Here are six steps to gaining approval of product labeling within the certification process: # The authorized COSMOS-standard certification body must first approve of the product specification. # # The applicant must submit their proposed product labeling to the certification body and await approval. Generic label designs for certain single-ingredient product are acceptable if the design is consistent for all products. # # In the event the product specification is not approved first, the labeling can only get provisional approval. # # Only after full approval of the labeling is granted by the certification body can the manufacturer print the labelling. The certification process must be completed before the labels can be used commercially. # # If the manufacturer needs to make changes to the product or labeling after gaining certification, they must notify the certification body and wait for written approval or a certificate update. Further approval from the certification body will be needed if the manufacturer makes changes to the organic percentage of the ingredients. The vendor will also have to make an amendment to the ingredients. # # Before the product can be launched, the labeling must be approved by the certification body and the product must be listed on the COSMOS-standard certificate. Printing labels without first getting approval can lead to certification withdrawal if the certification body determines the products and labels are non-compliant. Basic Labeling Requirements Manufacturers and marketers are only allowed to use COSMOS terms and signatures for products authorized by the certification body. The certification body must be identified on product labels if it is not clearly mentioned anywhere else on the product. In cases in which the label size restricts product labeling, the certification body may allow flexibility as long as the product maintains the general principles of the Labeling Guide. The firm must at least mention the nature of the certification (such as organic or natural) and the identity of the certification body. Product Identification Marketers are allowed to use the COSMOS terms and signatures on company letterhead and websites under certain conditions. All the products of a brand must be certified organic in order for the company to make the claim they are \\"COSMOS ORGANIC certified.\\" Otherwise, the firm must be clear that only specific products have been certified organic. In other words, the use of the terms and signatures must not be misleading to the consumer. Essentially, the labelling must clearly and accurately describe the product, which must comply with the standard. The marketer must avoid listing ingredients or naming the product in a way that implies it contains certain ingredients that are not present. Any use or branding of the term \\"organic,\\" for example, must comply with the organic standard and not be confusing to the consumer. The labeling must not confuse the terms \\"organic\\" and \\"natural,\\" which have separate definitions and certifications based on the way the products and ingredients are processed. If a brand sells several organic products and a few natural products, they must make it clear in their labeling and marketing the differences. The firm must also be clear if some of its products have no certification at all. In other words, in order for a company to promote itself as \\"COSMOS ORGANIC certified,\\" its entire range of products must meet the organic standard and be certified. Companies are not allowed to use logos or seals that may mislead customers into believing the products are COSMOS certified.

He began painting when he was 85 years old (he lived to age 94). Many of his paintings now reside in the Smithsonian American Art Museum's permanent collection and have been put on public display as part of various Smithsonian art exhibitions. Early life David Courlander was born in Bay City, Michigan on September 10, 1866. The Courlander family soon moved to Detroit, where they lived on Gratiot Avenue (which Courlander described as a mud road with wooden sidewalks). As a young man, Courlander worked in a general merchandise store in Frankfort Station, Illinois, and subsequently worked in Kansas City and other Midwestern cities as a window dresser. He had a men's tailoring establishment of his own in Indianapolis and during World War I, moved (with his wife, the former Tillie Oppenheim, and their three children) to Detroit. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, after the death of his wife, he lived with his daughter, Adelaide, and her family on a farm near Romeo, Michigan. =Family= David Courlander was the son of Aaron Jacob Courlander (born in Mitau, Courland) and Adelaide Hirsch (born in Barweiler, Germany). David Courlander had four sisters: Anna, Etta, Bertha, and Julia; one brother, Eli; and one known half-brother, Israel Harris Courlander. David married Tillie Oppenheim in 1895 and they had two daughters, Adelaide Courlander (became Frane) and Berthe Courlander (became Langer, then Nichols); and one son, Harold Courlander. Painting career Courlander began painting in 1952 when he was 85 years old and continued until a few months prior to his death in 1961. Courlander began to exhibit his paintings (both oils and watercolors) at various community centers in the Detroit area, and in 1953 had a one-man show at the Associated American Artists gallery in New York. Reeves Lewenthal, director of the gallery, said that it was the first time in the gallery's history that the works of an untutored artist had qualified for such a show. Said Lewenthal, \\"[Courlander] is a fantastic primitive who paints completely from memory. He has an inventive spirit uniquely his own. He is on the same level as Grandma Moses. He is definitely a rare find in the art world.\\" In fact, Courlander was affectionately dubbed \\"Grandpa Moses\\" by the Detroit press; other times he was referred to as \\"Grandpa Courlander of Michigan.\\" Courlander's paintings included landscapes, still lifes, country scenes, and historical and religious occasions. Courlander's specific subject matter varied widely, ranging from village and farm scenes of the 1870s to St. Patrick Day parades, circus themes, the backwoods and hills of Michigan and Indiana, fishing scenes, horseracing, and scenes of pre-1900 Chicago. Following his successful first show, Courlander attracted considerable attention and his paintings were exhibited at other galleries in New York, New Jersey, and Michigan. In 1958, several of his paintings were selected for the Smithsonian Institution's national touring exhibition of American Primitive Artists. Eight paintings by David Courlander are currently in the Smithsonian Institution's permanent art collection, and his paintings have been displayed by the Smithsonian American Art Museum and by the National Museum of American History.

She was also the co-founder of the Free Mumia Abu-Jamal Coalition (NYC), the Jericho Movement for U.S. Political Prisoners and Prisoners of War, and was the vice president of the Republic of New Afrika.  Early life  She was born in The Bronx in 1950, one of ten children in a \\"devoutly Christian, middle-class family.\\" She planned on becoming a doctor and attended New York City Community College as a premed student, pledging at the college's only integrated sorority. Bukhari's political awakening did not happen until college. On a sorority trip, she encountered a Black Panther member selling newspapers who asked if she and her friends wanted to volunteer with the Free Breakfast for Children program.  Black Panther Party and Black Liberation Army  Along with some of her sorority sisters, Bukhari began volunteering with the Free Breakfast program. She discovered that the police were spreading rumors that the Panthers were feeding the children poisoned food. Bukhari noted, \\"They didn't have a breakfast program in the schools themselves, they were not making an effort to feed the children, but they didn't want us to feed the children.\\" In 1969, she witnessed an officer harassing a Panther who was selling papers in Times Square. When she told the officer the Panther had a right to disseminate political literature, she was arrested. According to her, those incidents led to her officially joining the Black Panther Party. She worked out of the Party's Harlem office, becoming in charge of Information and Communications for the East Coast Panthers. Bukhari was critical of the Party's treatment of female Panthers. In 1969, she gave birth to a daughter, Wonda Jones, whose father Robert Webb was killed during the Party's split. In 1971, she converted to Islam. After being subpoenaed to testify about the Black Liberation Army (BLA) in April 1974, she went \\"underground\\" with the BLA to avoid testifying.  Arrest and incarceration  On January 25, 1975, Bukhari was captured after a shooting in Norfolk, VA that left a fellow BLA member dead and another shot in the face. Even though she had a license to open carry in public, she was charged with illegal possession of a weapon, felony murder, and attempted robbery. At her arraignment, her own lawyer threatened to have her bound and gagged. The jury selection, trial and sentencing all happened in one day, and she was not allowed in court during her trial. She was sentenced to 40 years. Bukhari was sent to Virginia Correctional Center for Women. She was considered the \\"most dangerous inmate\\" there. She needed surgery but was denied treatment by prison personnel. On New Year's Eve 1976, Bukhari attempted to escape, after one month of frequent hemorrhaging for which she was not allowed to see a doctor. She was captured two months later and returned to Virginia. While imprisoned, Bukhari and fellow inmates founded a program called Mothers Inside Loving Kids (MILK) to prevent the separation of children from incarcerated mothers. Bukhari also filed a lawsuit against the Virginia prison system for US$1.45 million in 1979, alleging that her segregation in prison was unconstitutional and amounted to cruel and unusual punishment, as well as deprivation of equal protection and due process of law. In August 1983, she was released on parole, with the condition of never associating with BLA or the Panthers again.  Later life  In 1984, Bukhari married anarchist Ashanti Alston. She worked as a social worker at the Legal Aid Society. Bukhari continued to be politically active after she was paroled. In 1992, she helped form the New York chapter of the Free Mumia Abu-Jamal Coalition. In 1998, she helped coordinate the Jericho March and Rally for U.S. Political Prisoners and Prisoners of War in Washington, D.C. Jericho became, as she described it, \\"a movement with a defined goal of getting recognition that political prisoners exist inside the prisons of the United States, despite the government's denial.\\" Bukhari was also involved in the Malcolm X Grassroots Movement. She co-hosted the radio show \\"Where We Live\\" with Sally O'Brien on WBAI, focusing on prison-related issues. Bukhari was the vice president of the Republic of New Afrika, a provisional government working to form a Black nation composed of South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana, \\"states built on the backs of enslaved Africans.\\" On August 24, 2003, Bukhari died of heart failure at North Shore University Hospital in Queens, NY. After her death, Abu-Jamal said from prison that she \\"was a true revolutionary. Patient, constant, disciplined, and determined ... [who, like Che] Guevara, was 'motivated by great feeling of love.'\\" Her papers were published posthumously after her daughter Wonda Jones asked Laura Whitehorn to help her collect, edit and publish them. Her papers became The War Before: The True Life Story of Becoming a Black Panther, Keeping the Faith in Prison and Fighting for Those Left Behind, published in 2010 by The Feminist Press.

The Craigends Yew (NS4199566134) is an ancient European layering yew (Taxus baccata) growing next to the River Gryffe in what were the grounds of the Craigends Estate, Houston in Renfrewshire, Scotland. Estimates put its age at around 500 to 700 years old and it is one of the largest and oldest examples of a heritage layering yew in Scotland.Rodger, Page 171 The tree The tree trunk and layering branches. The Ancient Tree Inventory records the Craigends Yew as tree number 31486. Layering yews differ from the standard growth form in that their branches grow in a pendulous fashion and upon contacting the soil level they root, a process called 'layering' and they may also send up new vertical stems. The central trunk will eventually die and the clones will continue to grow resulting in an increasing circumference and eventually a hollow centre. As layering is not a process involving sexual reproduction the new plants are clones of the parent tree and all of the new individuals formed have identical DNA with each other and the parent. Estimates for the tree's age are for 600 to 700 years. The clonal grove has achieved a second row of branch layering and the crown has reached a circumference of 328ft or 100m. The parent tree has a girth of 27ft or 8.86m at 30cm.Rodger, Page 171 The tree has a number of epiphytes such as ferns, ivy, liverworts, lichens and mosses that are encouraged by the high humidity maintained by the leaf cover of this evergreen species, supplemented by occasional flooding by the river. The condition of the tree is that it has a hollowing trunk, many water pockets in the branch angles, holes in the main trunk, decaying branches in the crown and rotting wood on the ground. A number of dormant buds on the horizontal branches are producing vertical growth of branches of varying sizes. The tree lies just off a public footpath and it can also be viewed from the path through the park on the opposite side of the River Gryffe. It has been subjected to a degree of vandalism in the past, but in 2018 a conservation programme removed several trees from within the grove to reduce shading and cleared much of the surrounding scrub vegetation to improve access. The tree grove is in good health and has space to expand further on two sides as a housing estate fence confines it to the east and the River Gryffe does so to the north. It is possible to enter as a path has been cut through with only minor damage to the grove itself. =Growth forms of yew trees= File:Ancient Yew - geograph.org.uk - 726972.jpgThe common growth form of yew trees.

A very rare growth form is where the original parent tree forms a grove through the roots, rather than the stems, throw up clonal trees as suckers as with the Clan Fraser tree at Stratherrick near Fort Augustus.Rodger, Page 228 History Coat of arms of the Cuninghames of Craigends. In 1479 the lands of Craigends were granted to William Cuninghame (d. 1520), the second son of Alexander Cuninghame, the first Earl of Glencairn and this cadet branch established themselves at Craigends until the 20th century.Robertson, Page 97 The first fortified manor house was built by William. John Charles Cuninghame, the 17th and final laird died in 1917 and the estate passed to Alison Cuninghame, his widow. Alison died in 1958 and the estate then was inherited a nephew who sold the estate to the developers Taylor Woodrow. In 1971 the mansion house was demolished and by 1973, Taylor Woodrow had started construction on the first of what would be many housing estates within the grounds. In 1818 the estate is recorded as being ..adorned with pleasant orchards and gardens, the seat of the ancient familyRobertson, Page 97 and it may be that the Craigends Yew was amongst the first plantings on the estate by the Cuninghames in who held these lands from at least the time of Alexander Cuninghame (1426‚Äì1488), father of William, the first laird.Metcalfe, Page 418 In 2016 the Craigends Yew was shortlisted for Scotland's Tree of the Year by the Woodland Trust.

They also made several notable windjammers including the stunning five-masted K√∏benhavn. History The company was formed in May 1877 in the outer harbour area of the Water of Leith on the west side of the Shore in Leith, backing onto the then relatively new Victoria Dock. Ships were launched into the Water of Leith, greatly limiting the maximum size of ship capable of launch. Production moved from iron to steel in 1880 and major expansions were made in 1892. The company quickly gained a reputation for creating luxury steam yachts for the rich and famous. They also made tramp steamers and various mid-sized vessels for East India service.https://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Ramage_and_Ferguson The \\"Ferguson\\" of Ramage & Ferguson is elusive and appears to have been a silent (and anonymous) partner. Probably the funder of the venture, there is some indication that Ferguson may have been Robert McNair Ferguson or connected to him in some way. In the First World War the company made two hospital ships for the Admiralty. In 1918 their yard manager, Henry Robb, left to form his own rival shipbuilding company. Ramage & Ferguson got into financial difficulty in 1934 and was bought over by Henry Robb & Sons, an existing shipbuilder in Leith, as a secondary yard. The yard was used up until the 1970s and cleared of buildings in 1985. The slipway remained intact until around 1995 when it was built over to form a section of the Water of Leith Walkway. The position is still visible from the eastern bank. Richard Ramage He was born on 28 June 1834 in or near Glasgow. He was apprenticed to William Denny and Brothers in Dumbarton around 1848, where he learnt his skills as a shipbuilder. In 1877 he moved to Edinburgh and founded Ramage & Ferguson.

In 1900 he was living at The Hawthorns, 212 Ferry Road in Leith.Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1900 By this time he had retired and passed the business to his son, Alexander Gulliland Ramage.

Alexander Gulliland Ramage He is thought to have been born in or near Glasgow around 1870. He was the son of Richard Ramage and his wife, Elizabeth Ogilvie Gulliland (b.1836). He took over from his father Richard Ramage as partner and managing director of Ramage & Ferguson around 1895. In 1899 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.

Early life  She was born and raised in Raleigh, North Carolina on November 13, 1867. She was the oldest of nine children born to William and Anne Cannon Shanks Simpson. Her mother, Anne Cannon Shanks, had moved from Glasgow, Scotland to Raleigh. Jane grew up in a house of strong Christian beliefs. When she was 19, she married 40-year-old Charles McKimmon, a local business owner. Together, they had four children. Jane Simpson attended public school for four years and spent another five years at the Peace Institute in Raleigh. She devoted one year to studying art and graduated from Peace at 16. At age 60, McKimmon obtained a B.S. degree from State College in 1926 and an M.S. degree in 1929. She received an honorary LL.D. in 1934 from the University of North Carolina, which recognized her contributions to education.  Career  In the early 1900s, McKimmon trained home demonstration agents to work with farm women. While farmers were learning new principles of scientific agriculture to improve their crop production, McKimmon and her home demonstration agents were striving to create new ways to increase female participation in agricultural life. When she took over the program in 1911, it consisted of 416 farm girls in 14 countries. Thirty years later, membership reached 70,000 across 100 countries. She traveled across the state of North Carolina recruiting farm girls to join tomato clubs. She also advocated for African-American women to be permanently hired as home demonstration agents. In 1917, she was appointed by Governor Thomas W. Bickett to help direct the food conservation program established during World War I. During World War II, Governor J. Melville Broughton appointed her to the State Council for National Defense. In 1945, University of North Carolina Press published her book, When We're Green We Grow, about home demonstration work in North Carolina.

During this time, they approximately had 700 to 800 people. They were a highly maritime culture dependent on the land and water sources around them. However, their tribe changed rapidly as European settlers came to the land, and they disappeared as a tribe in result of this by 1780.  Etymology  The original meaning of Weapemeoc could be \\"People of the First Light,\\" or \\"People of the Dawn Land,\\" similar to Wabanaki or Wampanoag. The tribe was also commonly referred to as Yeopim as a shortened alternative. It is predicted that this alternative name was the outcome of settlers attempting to pronounce the tribes name. There were also many subdivisions of the tribe each with their own individual names. Pre-Colonial History The first recording of the Weapemeoc Indians was in 1585. During this time, they were said to have approximately 700 to 800 people. Throughout their existence, they migrated across various North Carolinian counties such as Currituck, Pasquotank and Perquimans and Chowan. Despite their existence only first being noted in 1585, accounts shared by members of the Weapemeoc tribe have enabled historians to reconstruct their history. In 1550, the Weapemeoc Indian tribes were at peace with surroundings tribes and alliances were common. From 1585 to1586, a map of the Weapemeoc nation was established. Their land focused along the coastline and rivers. In 1607, the James River area became the battleground between the Weapemeoc Nation, the Powhatan Confederacy and tributary nations. In 1622, battles continued between neighboring tribes and English Settlers. This eventually became known as the Indian Massacre of 1622. Three years later in 1625, a smallpox and measles outbreak killed many Native Indians who did not have natural immunity to such illnesses. In 1650, European presence increased as more and more settlers arrived in North Carolina. With such large numbers of men arriving, the male to female ratio in the Albemarle region of North Carolina was close to 8 to 1. In 1670, marriages between British settlers and Indian women started to occur. This encouraged the exchange of cultures and prompted negotiations to end the constant battles.: During negotiations the battles continued and as a result the tribe's population dramatically decrease. By 1700, it is believed that the Weapemeoc tribe only had a population of around 200 people. In 1704, a reservation of 10,240 acres along the North River was established for the tribe. However, they were completely surrounded by European settlers and peace did not continue. Many members of the tribe left their reservation and moved to Indiantown.  Colonization  The Weapemeoc Indians were located in what is northeastern North Carolina today. In the early 1580s they experienced a dramatic cultural shift with the arrival of European colonizers. The English established a short two year settlement from 1584 to 1586 and subsequent settlements were established by Spanish, Portuguese and French explorers. The initial interactions between Weapemeoc and settlers remained minimal and were limited to the shoreline. However these interactions eventually resulted in conflict with European efforts to displace the tribe from their traditional maritime way of life. While some of the subdivisions of the tribe formed alliances with the settlers, others remained loyal to their traditional roots. Those who regularly interacted with the settlers exchanged their cultural ways of living. With the ever growing encroachment of the settlers, a reservation of 10,240 acres was granted to the tribe by the Executive Council of the colonial government. However by 1780, the Weapemeoc lived in such a similar fashion to their European neighbors that distinguishable archaeological records could no longer be made. The loss of the traditional culture of the tribe was paired with their disappearance as a distinct group of people. Due to little documentation, it is not clear when the last Weapemeoc member passed away. Today there are no known remaining Weapemeoc Indians and are believed to be an extinct tribe. Culture The Weapemeoc Indians almost certainly spoke an Algonquian language. The Weapemeoc Indians were very skilled hunters and farmers. As they lived close to banks and rivers, the tribe had access to freshwater fish, clams, and mussels year round. Their various fishing instruments ranged from spears, hooks and nets, demonstrating their excellent maritime skills. Their diets also consisted of seasonal elements such as corn and any animals which they managed to hunt using a bow and arrow. Due to the importance of water in their daily lives, many religious rituals and superstitions revolved around maritime activities. For example in the event of violent waters or potential signs of a storm, the Weapemeoc Indians would throw tobacco and other herbs into the water in hopes of a resolution. However, this maritime culture began to fade as the European settlers began to colonize in their area. Consequently, the members of the tribe began to lose much of their cultural practices and tradition. The Weapemeoc Indians, over the course of almost 300 years, went from being a traditional maritime culture to a culture that was highly influenced by European settlement.

Flood (born September 13, 1932) is a former educator and administrator in the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction and was instrumental in desegregating North Carolina schools.  Early life  Dudley E. Flood, an African American, was born on September 13, 1932 in Winton, North Carolina. He received his bachelor's degree from North Carolina Central University in 1954. Flood taught from 1955-1967 and was a principal at a Pitt County School from 1968-1970. Early in his teaching career, Flood taught Eighth Grade English, Math, and Science. Prior to serving as principal, he was a high school social studies teacher as well as a varsity football and basketball coach. Flood said, \\"I always knew I would be a teacher. I didn't know where, how or when, but I always knew I would be a teacher.\\" After being a principal Flood went on to work for the State Department of Public Instruction from 1970-1973.  Desegregation attempts  While working for the Department of Public Instruction, Flood, along with Gene Causby, was tasked with helping local communities desegregate their schools. The two men traveled across the state meeting with elected officials, community activists, and parents in order to ensure desegregation. One of the toughest challenges they faced was in Hyde County, NC. In Hyde County, there had been a school boycott that had lasted almost a full year and Flood and Causby were given the task to get children back to school. They held a contentious community wide discussion where ‚Äú... everyone from students, parents and teachers to the Black Panthers and Ku Klux Klan was expected to show up‚Äù. The result of the meeting; a decision to reopen the schools as one integrated school. This was just one example of the efforts undertaken by Flood during this time.  Further education  Flood earned a bachelor's degree from North Carolina Central University. Later, he earned his master's degree in education administration from East Carolina University in 1970 and his Doctorate in Education from Duke University in 1980. He studied further at Elizabeth City State University, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Hampton University.  Personal and current life  Dudley Flood was married to the late Barbara Thomas Flood for 54 years. He currently serves on several boards and committees including the N.C. Minority Cancer Awareness Action Team, Public School Forum of North Carolina Board, Wake Education Partnership Leadership Council, and the UNC Press Advancement Council; as well as many others. Additionally, Flood served on the University of North Carolina Board of Governors, as the Executive Director of North Carolina Association of School Administrators in form of Vice Chairman of North Carolina Central University.

After criticizing the organization's all white leadership roles, Johnson joined the Young Men's Christian Association. After the organization sent Johnson to France to observe during World War I, Johnson published a book about her findings called, Two Colored Women with the American Expeditionary Forces (1920). This book was written with Addie Waites Hunton. The rest of Johnson's life was dedicated to spreading African American activism across the states through book selling to help in the campaign for civil rights.  Early life  Kathryn Magnolia was born on December 15 of 1878 in Darke County, Ohio. Johnson's parents were Walter and Lucinda Jane McCown Johnson. Johnson went to high school in New Paris, Ohio and graduated in 1895. Johnson received a bachelor's degree and a teaching certificate after she attended Wilberforce University in Wilberforce Ohio. Johnson also studied at the University of North Dakota in 1908.  Teaching career and activism  Johnson's career began as a teacher in Ohio, North Carolina and Kansas City. Johnson taught at the State Normal School for Negroes in North Carolina and then was also the Dean of Women at Shorter College in Little Rock, Ark. in 1906. While teaching in a high school, Johnson joined the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People as one of the first members when it was first formed in 1909. During her time in the association, Johnson was a sales representative for the NAACP's journal, The Crisis. As a branch organizer in the association, she was also responsible for helping dozens of branches of the association throughout the south. However, Johnson began to criticize that the NAACP failed to have any colored people as leaders so Johnson left the association in 1916. Johnson joined the Young Men's Christian Association. In the YMCA, Johnson worked amongst African Americans. The YMCA ended up sending Johnson and her coworker, Addie Waites Hunton, to France. In France, they were responsible for examining the treatment of black soldiers during World War I. Once they returned home, the two of them wrote the book Two Colored Women with the American Expeditionary Forces (1920). The book described the poor treatment black soldiers observed in the cultural climate of France during the war.  Later life and legacy  Johnson's mission after returning from France was to spread activism against racial oppression by promoting literacy. Johnson began a nationwide campaign to help improve the civil rights through promoting literacy. This included selling books from black authors called \\"A Two Foot Shelf of Negro Literature\\" and selecting and circulating literature by Carter G, Woodson, W. E. B. Du Bois, Benjamin Brawley and James Weldon Johnson. By being a bookseller, Johnson hoped to promote reading among African Americans in order for them to learn more about their historical contributions and hopefully to then inspire them to take action in fight against racial oppression. Over the years, Johnson had traveled over \\"9,000 miles and sold 15,000 books.\\" Johnson's work also helped showed the possibilities as well as restrictions that African American women had during this time period. During her old age, Kathryn Magnolia Johnson lived in Ezella Mathias Carter Home for Colored Working Women in Chicago. Johnson died on November 13, 1954.

Jarrett had a primary focus on mental health and chronic illnesses. From writing books to making scientific breakthroughs within post-traumatic stress disorder studies, Jarrett brought attention to these overlooked subjects of her time.  Early life and education  Mary Cromwell Jarrett was born in Baltimore, Maryland on June 21, 1877 to Frank Asbury Jarrett and Caroline Watkins Cromwell Jarrett. Jarrett‚Äôs father not only worked as a bookkeeper and partner in a tailoring business, but also was a reporter in his later life, while her mother was a homemaker. When Jarrett was fifteen her father died. Jarrett graduated from Western High School and furthered her education by attending Women‚Äôs College of Baltimore in 1895, where she received her Bachelor of Arts in English. Jarrett focused on improving her writing skills through editing the Kalends, the college publication. Jarrett graduated in 1900.  Career  After college in 1903, Mary Cromwell Jarrett was offered a job working as a welfare worker at Boston Children‚Äôs Aid Society. It is there, where she truly learned about the social work casework method. In 1913, Jarrett was promoted to be the head of the casework department at Boston Children‚Äôs Aid Society, where Jarrett was able to direct and oversee the program. In this position, Jarrett developed a new method of working with patients in all social classes. In 1919, Jarrett became the associate director of a new graduate program at Smith College, which focused on psychiatric social work. This was the first session of the Smith College Training School of Psychiatric Social Work, which became the Smith College School for Social Work. Its immediate success led the Board of Trustees to make it a permanent program, and in 1919 Stuart Chapin was appointed Director. Jarrett was named Associate Director, and served in that capacity until 1923. During this time she was able to write and publish the book The Mental Hygiene of Industry, which emphasised how mental health has an impact on productivity. In 1920, Jarrett organized the Psychiatric Social Workers' Club, which later became the Psychiatric Section of the National Association of Social Workers. Shortly after, Jarrett focused on ingraining social work into Boston Psychopathic Hospital, which inspired her to co-author her second book in 1922 The Kingdom of Evil‚Äôs: 100 Case Histories. In 1923, Jarrett joined the U.S. Public Health Service as a policy analyst where she focused on chronic illness. Jarrett later moved to New York City to join the Welfare Council of New York City where she was on the Research Bureau, then was the secretary of the committee of Chronic Illness, and later transitioned to the secretary of the Health Division. While on the Committee of Chronic Illness, in 1933 Jarrett wrote a book called Chronic Illness in New York City. After working 16 years at the Welfare Council of New York City, Jarrett retired in 1949 after a few years of conducting her own studies, surveys and consultations at the municipal, state and national level, specializing in old age, chronic illness and the importance of social work in helping communities and individuals to cope with these conditions.  Death  She died in New York City on August 4, 1961.  Legacy  Jarrett was known for her role in developing the concept of \\"psychiatric social work\\", an outgrowth of the larger mental hygiene movement which swept the nation in the early part of the twentieth century. In Jarrett's words, as psychiatrists learned more about the nature of mental disorders, \\"the social problem of public mental health...increased from a matter of providing hospitals for the sick to an endeavor to promote mental development and prevent mental disease.\\" Jarrett was initially interested in how the properly trained social worker might facilitate the work of the psychiatrist, first by obtaining a detailed history from the patient's community (as an aid to correct diagnosis) and later by helping to bring about changes in the patient's environment necessary to his or her mental well-being. However, although social workers had long been versed in assisting people with physical, mental and emotional impairments to function on a basic level, Jarrett believed that social work was destined to become \\"a professional art in its own right, based upon a body of sociological theory\\" and incorporating basic psychiatric principles. Jarrett also was one of the founders of the Smith College School of Social Work, and she created a curriculum plan called ‚Äúblock plan,‚Äù which allowed students to have internships to complement their academic curriculum. Jarrett also created a program to help soldiers dealing with post-war trauma and helped them transition back into society. Through her hard work and dedication to social work, Jarrett helped this field evolve into a valued and respected profession.

After the war she worked as a physicist at Moscow State University and studied cosmic rays. She received numerous high state awards in her career and was awarded the title Honored Scientist of the Russian SFSR in 1990. She co-authored a book with Natalya Meklin-Kravtsova, an aviator from the regiment, titled We Were Called Night Witches about their experiences in the war, as their nickname given by their German opponents, Nachthexen, meant \\"night witches\\".  Early life  Rakobolskaya was born in 1919 in the city of Dankov to a family of physics teachers; her father had graduated from Moscow State University with a degree in astronomy in 1910. After graduating secondary school in 1938 she enrolled in the MSU School of Physics.  Military career  Rakobolskaya joined the military in October 1941 after the start of the Second World War; seventeen other students from the university also joined the 588th Night Bomber Regiment and trained at the Engels Military Aviation School, including Yevdokiya Pasko, Yekaterina Ryabova, and Yevgeniya Rudneva, who were awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union during the war. After finishing training in 1942 she was soon appointed as the regiment's chief of staff. She had accompanied a total of 15 sorties as a navigator by the time she was demobilized with the rank of major in 1946.  Later life and contributions to science  In 1946 she was demobilized from the military and finished her fourth year at the university and graduated in 1949, after defending her thesis on muons, developed under the guidance of Georgy Zatsepin and Vladimir Veksler. From 1950 to 1963 she worked as a class assistant, and from 1963 to 1977 as an assistant professor. In 1977 she became a professor in the Department of Cosmic Rays at the Physics Department of Moscow State University. In 1968, in conjunction with Georgy Zatsepin, Rakobolskaya dedicated a laboratory to the study of cosmic radiation at the Institute of Nuclear Physics in Moscow State University and was in charge of it until 1991. In 1968, she ordered the installation of X-ray emulsion chambers 60 meters below ground inside the Moscow Metro for research of the zenith angular distribution of muons. Their research studied the unusual phenomenon of coplanar expansion of secondary particles; the energy threshold and dependence of the phenomenon was established. Since 1971 she was the Deputy Head of the Department of Cosmic Rays and Space Physics at MSU and taught courses on cosmic rays and nuclear physics.

The expression 'Eastern European Jewry' has two meanings. The first meaning refers to the current political spheres of the Eastern European countries and the second refers to the Jewish kibbutzim in Russia and Poland. The phrase 'Eastern European Jews' or 'Jews of the East' (from German: Ostjuden) was established during the 19th century in the German Empire and in the western provinces of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, aiming to distinguish the integrating Jews in Central Europe from those in the East. This feature deals with the second meaning of the concept of Eastern European Jewry- the Jewish groups that lived in Poland, Ukraine, Belarus, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Russia, Romania, Hungary and modern Moldova in collective settlement (from Hebrew: Kibbutz- ◊ß◊ô◊ë◊ï◊•). Many of whom spoke Yiddish. At the beginning of the 20th century, over 6 million Jews lived in Eastern Europe. They were organized in large and small communities, living in big cities such as Warsaw (with a population of about 300,000 Jews) and in small towns with only tens or hundreds of Jews.  From the beginning of the Jewish settlement to the 18th century  Polish Jews in typical clothing - 17th century (top), 18th century (bottom) The first Jewish settlement in Eastern Europe began in a colony on the shores of the Black Sea during the 1st century. The settlement, which was located in the north of the Black Sea, was the only Jewish settlement in Eastern Europe until the 7th century. During that period, Jews began to immigrate to the east, towards the Khazar state. The immigrants Jews came from Byzantium and from Islamic countries, there, they received, like the Christians and the Muslims, full Religious and legal rights. At the end of the 10th century the Khazar state collapsed and the center of Jewish gravity in Eastern Europe moved to the Kiev principality. Kiev was the political and cultural center of the southern Russian duchies. The Jews played a significant role in the foreign trade of the city until the end of the 11th century and then, from the 12th century along with the rest of Central Europe. The Jews of Kiev are the submitters and receivers of the transaction of messages found amongst in the Cairo Geniza. From the end of the 12th century and the beginning of the 13th century, organized Jewish communities in Eastern Europe began to form. The growth of their population stemmed mainly from large migration from Central Europe in large numbers. Even non-Ashkenazi Jews settled in Eastern Europe, but their number was relatively small, and their influence on the socio-cultural character of Jews in Eastern Europe was marginal. At the beginning of the 16th century, the number of Jews in Eastern Europe was estimated at between 10,000 and 30,000. Some of their communities spoke Leshon Knaan and held various of other Non-Ashkenazi traditions and customs.Israel Bartal, \\"The Eastern European Jews Prior to the Arrival of the Ashkenazim\\", The Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities, May 29th, 2016. In parts of Eastern Europe, before the arrival of the Ashkenazi Jews from Central, some non-Ashkenazi Jews were present who spoke Leshon Knaan and held various of other Non-Ashkenazi traditions and customs. As early as the beginning of the 17th century, it was known that there were Jews living in cities of Lithuania, whose language was \\"Russiany\\" (from Hebrew: ◊®◊ï◊°◊ô◊™◊ê) and did not know the \\"Ashkenaz tongue\\", i.e. German-Yiddish. In 1966, the historian Cecil Roth questioned the inclusion of all Yiddish speaking Jews as Ashkenazim in descent, suggesting that upon the arrival of Ashkenazi Jews from central Europe to Eastern Europe, from the Middle Ages to the 16th century, there were a substantial number of Jews already there who later abandoned their original culture in favor of the Ashkenazi one.Cecil Roth, \\"The World History of the Jewish People. Vol. XI (11): The Dark Ages. Jews in Christian Europe 711-1096 [Second Series: Medieval Period. Vol. Two: The Dark Ages\\", Rutgers University Press, 1966. Pp. 302-303. Edgar C. Polom√©, Werner Winter, Reconstructing Languages and Cultures, Walter de Gruyter, 2011-06-24, . However, according to more recent research mass migrations of Yiddish-speaking Ashkenazi Jews occurred to Eastern Europe from the west who increased due to high birth rates and absorbed and/or largely replaced the preceding non- Ashkenazi Jewish groups of Eastern Europe (the latter groups's numbers are estimated, by the demographer Sergio DellaPergola to have been small). In the mid-18th century, the number of Jews increased to about 750,000. During this period only one-third of East European Jews lived in areas with a predominantly Polish population. The rest of the Jews lived among other peoples, mainly in the Ukrainian and Russian-Lithuanian environments. The numerical increase was due to mass migration of Yiddish-speaking Ashkenazi Jews from Central Europe to Eastern Europe beginning from the Middle Ages to the 16th century, as well as a high birth rate among these immigrants.Sergio DellaPergola, Some Fundamentals of Jewish Demographic History, in \\"Papers in Jewish Demography 1997\\", Jerusalem, The Hebrew University, 2001. Genetic evidence also indicates that Yiddish-speaking Eastern European Jews largely descended from Ashkenazi Jews who migrated from central Europe and subsequently experienced high birthrates and genetic isolation. In the mid-18th century, two-thirds of the Jewish population in Eastern Europe lived in cities or towns, and a third lived in villages - a unique phenomenon that hardly existed in Western Europe. In every village where Jews lived, there were only two Jewish families on average, and no more than ten Jews. In most of the urban localities in which they lived, the Jewish population was on average half the number of residents. It follows that in many towns there was a Jewish majority. This reality has been intensified over the years, with the percentage of Jews in cities and towns increasing, and thus the \\"shtetl\\" phenomenon was created - the \\"Jewish town\\", a large part of which was Jewish, and whose Jewish cultural character was prominent. = Economics and commerce = The Jews engaged in trade and various crafts, such as tailoring, weaving, leather processing and even agriculture. The economic activity of Eastern European Jewry was different from that of Central and Western European Jews: in Eastern Europe, the Jews developed specializations in trade, leasing, and crafts, which were hardly found in Western Europe. The Eastern European Jewry also had a great deal of involvement in economic matters that Jews in Central and Western Europe did not deal with at all. Until the mid-17th century with the 1648 Cossack riots on Jewish population, eastern European Jews lived in a relatively comfortable environment that enabled them to thrive. The Jews, for the most part, enjoyed extensive economic, personal and religious freedom. Thus, for example, deportations, foreclosure of Jewish property, and the removal of financial debts of non-Jews to Jews, which were common in Western Europe, hardly existed in the East. Despite the privileges, there were also hatred expressions towards the Jews. This phenomenon was described by a Jewish sage named Shlomo Maimon: = Traditional life = The amount of Torah study among Eastern European Jews at the beginning of their settlement was little. As a result, many halakhic (from Hebrew: ◊î◊ú◊õ◊™◊ô◊ï◊™) questions and problems were addressed to rabbis and Torah scholars in Germany and Bohemia which were close to them. From the 16th century, luxurious study centers were established in Eastern Europe, where the Hassidic movement also began to develop. = Social Structure = The Jewish social structure in Eastern Europe was built of communities and from the mid-16th century to 1764, central institutions, including communal ones, of self-leadership in Eastern Europe were running. The two main institutions were the Four-State Committee and the Lithuanian State Council. The committees' role was to collect taxes from the Jewish communities and deliver them to the authorities. Later they took it upon themselves to represent the Jewish community to the foreign rulers of those countries. In addition, the committee had judicial authority over internal laws and Halachot (from Hebrew: ◊î◊ú◊õ◊ï◊™) within the Jewish communities. The Council of Four Lands was the highest institution among the committees. The committee was composed out of seven rabbinic judges when the head of them was always a representative of the Lublin community. The other members of the committee were representatives of the cities of Poznan, Krakow and Lvov. Historical documents bearing the Committee's signature indicate that in certain periods the committee was expanded to represent all the important communities in the kingdom, and then the number of representatives was close to thirty. At first, the committee met in Lublin, giving the city the status of a top-notch Jewish center. The conference, which lasted about two weeks, was held once a year during the winter, when the city's largest trade fair was coordinated. In a later period, the conference was held twice a year: a winter gathering in Lublin and a summer conference in the city of Yaroslav in Galicia.  From the late 18th century to the beginning of the 20th century  In the late 18th century, the Jews of Eastern Europe were divided into two major geographic regions: a settlement controlled by the Russian Empire, and a Galicia under the control of the Austria-Hungarian Empire. = The settlement = The three divisions of Poland (first in 1772, then in 1793, and finally in 1795) left the Aryan part of the Polish Jewry under the authority of the Russian Empire. The Russian government turned out to be less tolerant towards Jews, and more restrictions were imposed on Jews than the rest of the Polish people. In 1791 Czarina Yekaterina the Great established the region of the Settlement (the 'Moshav') in the western fringes of the empire, where only Jews were allowed to live. The Moshav included most of the former territories of Poland and Lithuania, which were populated by concentrations of Jews. Limiting those boundaries led to the uprooting and deportation of Moscow and St. Petersburg Jews to the eastern border of the country which was one of the main goals of the authorities). Later, the Jews of Kiev were also forbidden to live in their own city, even though Kiev itself was included in the \\"region of the Settlement.\\" At the beginning of the 20th century, more than five million Jews lived in Czarist Russia, with 90% of them concentrated in the region of the Settlement and about three million Jews lived in the former borders of Poland. According to various estimates, Eastern European Jewry at the beginning of the 20th century constituted 80% of world Jewry. = Galicia = Another large Jewish community in Eastern Europe was Galicia, the territory that was given to Austria in the partition of Poland. Towards the end of the 19th century, Emperor Franz Joseph intended to \\"acculturate\\" the Jews by establishing a network of schools for general studies. Some Jews supported this goal, but most of them opposed it. Further resistance arose when an attempt was made to settle the Jews on the land. The Jews in Galicia were known for their religious piety, and they fought hard against the Enlightenment and against attempts to \\"assimilate\\" them culturally. There was also a sharp confrontation between supporters of Hasidism and those opposed to it. Eventually Hasidism won and became the dominant movement among the Jews of Galicia. In 1867, the Jews of Galicia were granted full equality of rights, and thus were the first among the Jews of Eastern Europe to be emancipated. The Zionist movement flourished in Galicia. During the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, before World War I the Jewish community flourished in Galicia. A large number of books and poems were published there, many Torah sages were engaged in it and Zionism and Yiddish culture also emerged. At the beginning of the 20th century, the number of Jews in Galicia reached more than 800,000.

She was also one of the first American academics to forge links with mainland Chinese academic institutions after the formalisation of Sino-US relations. Early life Cheng was born to journalist Cheng Shewo and Hsiao Tsung-jang (Ëï≠ÂÆóËÆì) in Hong Kong during the Second Sino-Japanese War. As a result of her father's job, Cheng moved frequently with her family during her youth to Guilin, Chongqing, and Beiping. After the end of the war, the family returned to Hong Kong, though Cheng's older brother later returned to People's Republic of China to help with the socialist movement. In 1952, the family moved Cheng and her elder sister Catherine Chia-lin Cheng (ÊàêÂòâÁé≤Ôºâto Taiwan. Education Cheng attended the prestigious Taipei First Girls' High School, before joining the Department for Foreign Languages at National Taiwan University. In her second year, Cheng studied abroad in the Music Department of University of Hawaii, despite her father's objections. During her stay, Cheng worked as a babysitter for a wealthy American family; the experience piqued her interest in class stratification. She then went on to obtain an MA in Sociology from the university and an MA in library studies at the University of Chicago, before completing her PhD at the University of Hawaii in 1970. Career=USA= Cheng became assistant professor of sociology at UCLA in 1970. Due to her engagements with politics and student movements, she became director of UCLA's Asian American Studies Center; the first permanent director since the center was founded in 1969. Cheng developed and expanded the centre, employing some of its major scholars, like Valerie Matsumoto, Robert A. Nakamura, and Russell Leong. Under Cheng, the center was run according to socialist principles, with students and teachers rejecting hierarchical structures considered typical in capitalist America. In 1978, alongside the Chinese Historical Society of Southern California, Cheng organised the 'Southern California Chinese American Oral History Project'. The project focussed on oral testimonies of history by grassroots Chinese Americans, encouraging them to engage with cultural struggles both in China and America. After the normalisation of Sino-US relations in 1979, Cheng visited a Chinese university with other members of UCLA, becoming one of the first academic parties to visit the mainland. Cheng had, however, visited the Chinese mainland throughout the 1970s in a person capacity, searching for her brother and sister on her father's behalf. During one visit, she met with Zhou Enlai, who informed her that her father was no longer considered an enemy by the Communist Part. In 1985, Cheng founded the Center of Pacific Rim Studies at UCLA, for research on regions typically on the borders of other studies. =Taiwan= Cheng assumed management of her father's Taiwan-based paper, the Li pao (), in 1991 and continued to support leftist perspectives. She then divided her time between the United States and Taiwan, teaching at Shih Hsin University, before becoming a professor there in 1993, when she founded a course on gender and development.

A former researcher and lecturer at the universities of Copenhagen and Aarhus, she has also been active in politics and women's rights, most recently in connection with the PISA approach to student assessment. As editor of the socialist journal Naturkampen in the 1980s, she covered subjects as varied as the management of cancer research and the European Union's approach to agriculture in the third world. Biography Born on 14 April 1941 in the Frederiksberg district of Copenhagen, Inge Biehl Henningsen was the daughter of the haberdasher Sven Aage Henningsen (1990‚Äì91) and the correspondent Elisabeth Braunstein (1911‚Äì96). After matriculating from Holte Gymnasium in 1959, she read statistics at Copenhagen University, graduating in 1966. Career On graduating, Henningsen joined the university's Institut for Matematisk Statistik where she taught and carried out research until 2007, becoming an associate professor in 1974. Her interest in politics started when as an undergraduate she joined the socialist Studentersamfundet (student society). From its establishment in 1967, she was active in the Left Socialists party ( Venstresocialisterne), together with her partner Steen Folke, becoming a member of the board and, from the late 1960s, editor of the party's journal Politisk Revy. While on a study trip to the United States (1969‚Äì70), she became involved in the emerging New Women's Movement. On her return to Denmark, she promoted the new women's activities for the Left Socialists in the 1970s. From 1980 to 1991, she was editor of Naturkampen, the socialist organ for women who were critically involved in topics such as science and technology, participating in articles on cancer research, technology risk assessment, third world agriculture and AIDS. Both in her professional life and in her extramural activities, Henningsen became an effective communicator, interpreting statistical information for non- specialists, frequently criticizing how statistics were being misused. She became particularly active in the educational sphere, demonstrating, for example, how statistics revealed more limited choices for girls than for boys in regard to the applied sciences. She has also collaborated with women researchers in sociology, politics and psychology, revealing how women did not enjoy the same opportunities as men in higher education and research. In this connection, in 1998 she became a member of the Gender Equality Research Foundation under the Ministry of Research. More recently, on the basis of statistics, she has published articles on the extent to which girls are disadvantaged in Denmark's educational environment, but she also points out that a fair proportion of boys are increasingly considered to be \\"losers\\" in the absence of effective vocational programmes and internships. Other topics she has examined with a statistics viewpoint include bullying in the classroom (2009 & 2013), gender and educational choices (2008), and a critical examination of the results of the PISA reports (2008 & 2017).

She allegedly helped her husband, Henry Berry Lowrie, flee after he and his gang killed many white people in attempt to avenge his father and brother's deaths.  Early life  Rhoda Strong Lowry was born in Robeson County, North Carolina in 1849. Nicknamed \\"Queen of Scuffletown\\" due to her beauty, Rhoda was a legendary figure in Southern history for more than a century. Rhoda is thought to have grown up living in Robeson County with her father, who is believed to be a white man who changed his name from \\"Gorman\\" to \\"Strong\\" after fleeing murder charges in the state of Virginia. Rhoda's mother died when she was young, so Rhoda was often tasked with looking after her father. During this time the Lumbee Indians suffered from a state law that forbid them from voting or owning guns, making farming their only way of obtaining food.  Marriage and activism  Rhoda and her cousin Henry Berry Lowry started dating and not long after they made plans to wed. On December 7, 1865, the two were legally married in Robeson County, North Carolina. Rhoda was sixteen years old at the time, while Henry was 20. When Henry escaped from jail, sources claim he not only wanted to return to Rhoda, but that she helped him escape. According to legend, Rhoda walked eighty miles from Scuffletown to Wilmington, North Carolina to set her husband free. Rhoda brought food to Henry's jail and seduced the jailer with her good looks. She refused the jailer's initial advances, but promised she would return. The next evening Rhoda repeated her visit and entered the jailer's apartment with him, where she pretended to accept his advances. The jailer removed his coat, gun belt, and key ring. When he bent down to remove his shoes, Rhoda pulled a heavy lead pipe from under her skirt and knocked the jailer unconscious. She then ran to the jail to free her husband with her newly stolen keys. Once Henry escaped, the pair paddled upstream in the Cape Fear River until they reached Scuffletown. Later Henry was charged with killing a man and was imprisoned. He was moved to another prison due to feelings that his previous prison was not secure enough. He escaped the second prison and was placed on the most wanted list. Because the police could not find Henry, they changed strategies and started to arrest the wives of several band members and used them as bait. This ended up in a letter from Henry to the police saying that if they did not release their wives soon it would end up in a bloodbath. Rhoda's husband disappeared in 1872, after only 6 years of marriage, leaving her behind with their three children. His disappearance was a mystery to which she gave no clues and he was never found. She has a reputation for protecting her husband which made her very popular within her community, especially since her husband was thought of as a hero. She is often seen as in modern times as a symbol of resistance to oppression because she withstood intimidation and refused to disclose the whereabouts of her husband.

It aims to make an intellectual and moral case for free trade and sees Brexit as \\"an opportunity to revitalise the world trading system\\". The IFT was founded by Daniel Hannan, MEP for South East England, in September 2017. It is the United Kingdom's first, and currently only, think tank specialising exclusively in trade policy and the economics of trade. IFT works closely with, though independently of, the UK‚Äôs Department for International Trade.  Aims  IFT‚Äôs official aims are to ‚Äúrecapture the moral case for open commerce‚Äù and promote free trade. It aims to achieve this through educating civil society; bringing together businesses to assess the impact of trade barriers and their removal; and encouraging policymakers and lawmakers to support trade liberalisation. As well as holding events with high-profile speakers, IFT produces and distributes research aimed at specific audiences. These range from short explainer videos to long academic reports. While founded by a Conservative MEP, the IFT aims to be a non-partisan organisation and has supporters across the political spectrum. For example, Labour MP Graham Stringer wrote the foreword for 'The Left-Wing Case for Free Trade'. However, as it supports the UK leaving the EU in order to pursue an independent trade policy, it has drawn ire from politician's who supported Remain in the EU Referendum. Chuka Umunna described the think-tank as \\"fanatical hard Brexit-supporting ideologues\\",Boris Johnson under fire for waiving ¬£6,000 fee for hard Brexit event at Foreign Office.

IFT aims to fill the corresponding gap in UK-based research and expertise on trade issues, to help contribute to a more informed government, legislature, business community and general public. The initiative was launched in the Map Room at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office by Boris Johnson, the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, and Liam Fox, Secretary of State for International Trade, in September 2017. The IFT was not charged for the use of the room as the event was deemed to be in support of the Government's objectives on free trade. The IFT was initially named Institute for Free Trade, but changed to Initiative for Free Trade after it emerged that permission to use the title \\"Institute\\", which is protected by law, had not been granted by Companies House and the Business Secretary. In October 2017 IFT hosted its first event‚Äîthe Global Trade Summit (London)‚Äîand has supported and participated in the Conservatives International conferences in Miami and Kampala in 2017, as well as La Convenci√≥n Azul in Buenos Aires. In September 2018, it launched 'An ‚ÄúIdeal‚Äù US-UK Free Trade Arrangement‚Äô in conjunction with the Cato Institute and nine other free-market British and American think-tanks. Acted as a proposed template for a future trade agreement between the US and the UK, the paper attracted significant media attention.

The Keyauwee village was surrounded by palisades and cornfields about thirty miles northeast of the Yadkin River, near present day High Point, North Carolina. The Keyauwee village was vulnerable to attack, so the Keyauwee constantly joined with other tribes for better protection. They joined with the Tutelo, Sappony, Occaneechi, and the Shakori tribes, moving to the Albemarle Sound with the last two for a settlement that would later be foiled. The Keyauwee would move further southward along with the Cheraw and Peedee tribes, close along the border of the two Carolinas, where they conducted deerskin trade with Charleston traders and allied with the Indian neighbors in the Yamassee War. Eventually, their tribe name vanished from historical records, and with time, they were absorbed by the Catawba tribe.  History = European Discovery = In 1701, English explorer John Lawson, on a expedition over 1,000 miles, discovered the Keyauwee tribe, a small group which numbered about 500 people. Lawson discovered the tribe in Caraway Creek (now known as the Caraway mountains), about fourteen miles south of High Point, North Carolina. Lawson‚Äôs vivid account of his visit describes the village surrounded by high wooden walls, large cornfields, a large cave where about 100 people could have been able to dine in, all situated by very high mountains. These geographical features of their village are what made the Keyauwee vulnerable to attack. = Language and Ties to Other Tribes = The language and name of the Keyauwee Indian Tribe was derived from that of the Siouan family with whom they merged. Tribal merging in North Carolina was inhibited by relationships built on exchange and alliance, and circular rounds of war, peace, and trade. The Keyauwees were motivated to merge with the surrounding North Carolina tribes due to threats of warfare with other tribal nations. Although the merge with the Tutelos and Sapponys was successful, continuous attacks were still experienced by the Keyauwees and their newly combined tribe. Later, the Keyauwees moved towards the Albermarle Sound region, situated on the northeastern coast of North Carolina, to form settlements with the Occaneechi and Shakori tribes. Ultimately, the Keyauwee moved southward from here, moving to the Pee Dee region of South Carolina to merge with the Cheraw tribe, and potentially the Eno and Shakori tribes. It is here where the Keyauwee engaged in deerskin trade along with Charleston traders. According to the Jefferys Atlas of 1761, the Keyauwee settlements appear to be on the North Carolina/South Carolina border, along the Pee Dee River. After fighting along with their Indian allies in the Yamassee War against South Carolina colonists, it is believed that the Keyauwee merged with the Catawba tribe. The Keyauwee tribe merged with local tribes throughout their time due to factors like geographic proximity and Siouan language.

As a result it makes investigation of large biological samples with microscopy easier and faster. The method was published in 2014 by Etsuo A. Susaki and Hiroki R. Ueda, primarily for use in neurobiology research of brains from model organisms like rodents or small primates. But in upcoming years there were other works published, using CUBIC method on other tissues like lymph nodes or mammary glands. CUBIC can be also combined with CLARITY-based tissue clearing methods.  Used chemicals and performing of method  The opacity of brain tissue is given mainly by light scattering on interfaces between environments with various refractive indexes, mainly between lipids and other tissue compounds. Therefore, partial delipidating and refractive index matching of tissue and surrounding medium is straightforward way to make tissue less opaque and therefore transparent ‚Äì cleared. Development of CUBIC pipeline was inspired by previously published clearing protocol named Scale (mixture of glycerol, urea and detergent), because it¬¥s simplicity and optimal compatibility with fluorescent proteins. Authors of CUBIC screened 40 chemicals corresponding to those used in Scale with aim to conserve compatibility with fluorescent reporters but achieve better and faster clearing of the tissue. They found that basic amino alcohols are ideally suited for this purpose, probably because amino groups effectively solvate phospholipids and basicity helps to preserve fluorescence signal. Amino alcohols have also beneficial effect when used for clearing of other tissues, which are mostly highly vascularized, and their opacity is given by absorption of light by hemoglobin on top of light scattering. Amino alcohols reduce pigmentation of those tissues very effectively by eluting the hem from hemoglobin. The original protocol is two- step incubation of fixed tissue in two different aqueous based clearing solutions, altogether taking one to two weeks. First solution, referred as ScaleCUBIC-1, CUBIC-1 or just reagent-1, is composed of N,N,N‚Äô,N‚Äô-tetrakis(2-hydroxypropyl)ethylenediamine (commercially under name Quadrol), urea and Triton X-100 in water. Second solution, referred as ScaleCUBIC-2, CUBIC-2 or just reagent-2, is composed of urea and sucrose in water. This original protocol is slightly modified in different applications, namely in concentrations, incubation times or some components of solutions. The CUBIC protocol can be also combined with perfusion and provide whole organ and whole body clearing of rodents. Besides its use as standalone protocol for clearing, CUBIC-based composition of reagents can be used as refractive index matching solution for CLARITY. This than improve clearing abilities of CLARITY on tissues which stay opaque because of their pigmentation by hemoglobin. The improvement of CUBIC reagents has progressed and been reported.Animal Tissue- Clearing Reagents, TCI  Applications of method  The CUBIC method is very powerful, due to amino alcohols and consequent ability to clear almost any organ or even whole body of mice. One disadvantage is incompatibility with lipid dyes, due to high concretion of detergent used during clearing. Despite organic solvents, reagents used in CUBIC are not toxic or aggressive to optics of microscopes, on the other hand the handling with them can be also tricky due to their high viscosity. Also, in comparison with solvent based methods like 3DISCO the CUBIC as method based on simple diffusion is still take slightly longer times for clearing same tissue. Because of high concentration of detergent, the CUBIC ca also partially diminishes the fluorescence or disturb ultrastructure of the tissue. CUBIC was optimized and used for wide spread of applications and tissues. In the mouse the method was used for mapping the brain activity, analysis of interactions between immune cells in lymph node, description of mammary stem cells behaving or for capturing 3D anatomy of liver, kidneys, lungs and heart. CUBIC was also modified and used for clearing of chicken embryos or marmoset brains. The method was also optimized for clearing and examination of tumors and development of metastases from whole body perspective to single-cell resolution in mouse model. In recent study was also shown few variants of basic CUBIC pipeline, in this case used for diagnostic of human pathologies both on native and formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissues.

In 2001 she was appointed moderator of ministers and deacons at the Protestant Church of Geneva. The position dates back to 1541 when it was created by John Calvin, but Graessl√©, after 460 years, was the first woman to occupy it. In 2004 she was appointed the first director of the International Reformation Museum which opened the next year in Geneva, but she resigned the post in 2016. It was indicated that her departure followed disagreement about levels of funding.  Life  Isabelle Graessl√© was born in Strasbourg. She was her parents' only child. On successful completion of her school studies she went on to undertake the \\"Grandes √âcoles\\" preparation course. She studied Philology at Strasbourg, and then Theology at both Geneva and the United Theological Seminary in Dayton, Ohio from where she obtained a Master of Divinity qualification. Her doctorate, from the Protestant Theology Faculty at Strasbourg followed in 1988. She was supervised for her dissertation by Gilbert Vincent. Her topic was \\"Elements for a Rhetoric of Preaching: Readings of Athanase Josu√© Coquerel\\" (\\"√âl√©ments pour une rh√©torique de la pr√©dication: Lectures d'Athanase Coquerel\\"). Her habilitation, obtained from the University of Bern in 2004, opened the way, potentially, to a lifelong university professorial career. Meanwhile, in 1987 Graessl√© became a part-time pastor at the Protestant chaplaincy to the University of Geneva and director of the Centre for Protestant Studies. Between 1995 and 2002, within the curriculum at the Centre she taught Gender Studies at Geneva and, on the north shore, at Lausanne. The course she taught was entitled simply \\"Women and Religion\\" which enabled her to address a range of religious traditions that varied over the years, but always from the same starting points: discerning an ambivalent relationship between women and religion, the balance of tensions created within religious institutions by the new challenges presented by women's emancipation, and finally the preconception of a specific link between female sexuality and the prohibition on priesthood. It is apparent that there were some at the university who viewed Graessl√©'s approach with disfavour. In 1998 she became vice-president of the \\"college\\" of ministers and deacons at the Protestant Church of Geneva. Three years later, in August 2001, she was elected moderator - effectively leader - of the institution. Her electors were aware that \\"Business as usual\\" was not on her the agenda. In an interview with the Tribune de Gen√®ve she explained: \\"I told them clearly that I was not going to be their Am√©lie Poulain. I was determined to separate myself from this idea of the maternal woman, which was still embedded in the collective spirit. I was there to take a lead, support, encourage and indeed admonish all these ministers. Be assured that this task has not always been so simple\\".Jan-Hess Denayrouse, ¬´ Isabelle Graessl√© ¬ª, Tribune de Gen√®ve, 8 mars 2014, p. 26 After finishing her three years duty as moderator, she accepted the position as director of the new International Reformation Museum. The offer was timely, coming soon after her habilitation, and six months after her application for a full professorship with the Theology Faculty at the University of Geneva, where she taught, had been turned down. Twenty years as a pastor and university teacher had provided an excellent apprenticeship for the important museum job. She resigned unexpectedly, after ten years, in February 2016.  Marie Denti√®re  Graessl√© is also known for having demonstrated the key contribution of Marie Denti√®re to the Reformation in Geneva. It was in response to Graessl√©'s advocacy that Denti√®re's name was added to those of the men commemorated on the Reformation Wall monument in the grounds of the University, built into the old city walls.

The history of rail in Dedham, Massachusetts begins with the introduction of the first rail line in 1836 and runs to the present day. Multiple railroads have serviced the Dedham since then, and current service is provided by the MBTA. The station in Dedham Square built in 1881 out of Dedham Granite was demolished in 1951 and the stones were used to put an addition on the Town's library. There are two active stations today, and multiple others in close proximity. Dedham Branch service to Dedham Square The Dedham Train Station was located in Dedham Square where the parking lot now is. When Norfolk County was formed in 1793 Dedham was named as the shire town and \\"an influx of lawyers, politicians, and people on county business forced the town to abandon its traditional insularity and its habitual distrust of newcomers.\\" Turnpikes, including those linking Boston and Providence and Dedham and Hartford, were laid through town during the first few years of the 19th century. Inns and taverns sprung up along the new roads as more than 600 coaches would pass through Dedham each day on their way to Boston or Providence. Within a few decades of the turnpikes' arrival, railroad beds were laid through Dedham. The railroad was at first \\"considered dangerous. It was new fangled. People didn‚Äôt trust it, so they wouldn‚Äôt ride it. Only a very few brave souls in those opening years\\" ever boarded one. This fear was short lived, however as the first rail line came in 1836 and by 1842 locomotives had put the stagecoach lines out of business. The first line was a branch connecting Dedham station to the main Boston-Providence line at Readville, making stops at Stone Haven and East Dedham stations, all of which closed at the same on April 21, 1967. In 1881, the Boston and Providence Railroad company built a station in Dedham Square out of Dedham Granite. There were more than 60 trains a day running to it in its heyday, but it was demolished in 1951 and the stones were used to build the main branch of the Dedham Public Library. In 1886 the railroad built a new bridge over High Street and placed a granite plaque there to commemorate both the new bridge and the 250th anniversary of the town's incorporation. The plaque was removed sometime thereafter and ended up in the woods near railroad tracks in Sharon. It has since been returned to Dedham. =The Dedham and West Roxbury Branches= The Boston and Providence Railroad (B&P;) had opened from downtown Boston to south of Readville on June 4, 1834, and to Canton on September 12 of that year, but initially had no branch lines. It did, however, provide stagecoach connections for Dedham Center, starting on July 28, 1834. Direct train service between Boston and Dedham Center began on February 5, 1835, with the opening of the first railroad branch line service from Readville to Dedham Center. For the first several years of the Dedham Branch's existence, service to Dedham changed often between \\"Dedham Specials\\" (through trains from Boston to Dedham and vice versa, using the Boston and Providence main line and the Dedham Branch between Readville and Dedham) and horse-drawn cars cut out of mainline trains at Readville. Dedham Specials became permanent in June 1842, giving Dedham Center reliable direct train service to Boston and making it possible for the first time to commute by train for those living in the areas served by the northern portion of the Boston and Providence Railroad. This pattern of service persisted for the next eight years, until the West Roxbury Branch from Tollgate to Dedham via West Roxbury opened in June 1850. After this point, commuter service to Dedham ran via West Roxbury rather than Readville, although trains continued to run on the old Dedham Branch on non-commuter schedules. Commuter service to Dedham via Readville resumed in 1858, but was always lighter than commuter service via West Roxbury. Some of these trains were horse-drawn shuttle cars to East Dedham, rather than through Boston trains and they were not entirely replaced with through Boston trains until 1875. =The Norfolk County / New York and New England Railroad at Dedham= The Walpole Railroad was chartered on April 16, 1846, to build a railroad from Dedham to Walpole, but construction had not yet started when it was absorbed by the Norfolk County Railroad in July 1847. The Norfolk County, which had been chartered just three months prior to build from Walpole to Blackstone station, began passenger service between Dedham and Walpole in April 1849. Through Boston-Blackstone service via Dedham was instituted the next month. In December 1853, the Norfolk County merged with two other railroads to form the Boston and New York Central Railroad (B&NYC;). One of the two other railroads had been the Midland Railroad, chartered in May 1850 to build a new Boston entrance for the Norfolk County, branching off the original route at West Dedham. This new route opened at the beginning of 1855, replacing the original, but ran for only six and a half months before it was shut down by court order following a lawsuit against the B&NYC; concerning the new route's grade crossings in Dorchester. Service along the original route from Dedham to Blackstone resumed on August 6, 1855, and ran until March 1857, when the entire B&NYC; route from Boston to Mechanicsville, Connecticut reopened for a year under lease to the East Thompson Railroad. After the East Thompson shut down in March 1858, service from Dedham to Blackstone (as well as to Medway via the Medway Branch) resumed, being operated by trustees for the old Norfolk County. It was the only service along any of the former B&NYC; lines until February 1867, when the entire B&NYC; route was reopened by the Boston, Hartford and Erie Railroad (BH&E; the successor to the B&NYC;). From 1867 onwards, the track from Dedham to Islington was little used by the BH&E; or its successor, the New York and New England Railroad (NY&NE;), and was torn up in 1883. In 1881, the NY&NE; opened a new Dedham route, branching off the NY&NE; mainline at Dedham Junction in southern Dedham and running north to Dedham station. This route was unable to compete with the B&P;'s Dedham and West Roxbury branches, and service ended in 1884. It reopened in 1888 due to technicalities in the NY&NE;'s charter, but closed again in 1899. The original Norfolk County Dedham route was rebuilt by the NY&NE; in 1890 to provide a Boston entry for the Old Colony Railroad's Wrentham Branch (the NY&NE; rebuilt the line to prevent the Old Colony from seizing its right-of-way). Wrentham Branch trains were rerouted along the NY&NE; mainline from Islington to Readville in 1899; an intermittently-operating shuttle between Dedham and Islington was run until 1904, using a self-propelled steam railcar. After this point, the two ex-NY&NE; Dedham lines saw only freight service. In 1864, Moses Boyd was the \\"well-known and gentlemanly\\" conductor of the Dedham branch of the Providence Railroad. At a party for his 25th wedding anniversary, his passengers presented him with gifts of cash that totaled between $600 and $700. In addition to the passengers from Dedham, West Roxbury, and Jamaica Plain, the President and Superintendent of the railroad attended the party at his home and presented him with a silver plate. =Late 19th and early 20th centuries= The Old Colony Railroad leased the B&P; in April 1888, and was itself leased to the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad (NYNH&H; or New Haven) in March 1893, while the NY&NE; (which became the New England Railroad in September 1895) was leased to the NYNH&H; in July 1898 and merged into the NYNH&H; in 1908. Dedham service reached an all-time peak around the turn of the 20th century, as with the entire Boston-area commuter rail system. In July 1898, Dedham was served by 36 inbound passenger trains each weekday (two- thirds of which ran via West Roxbury), including six Wrentham Branch trains, and Dedham service via Readville increased in 1901 to an all-time maximum of 17 inbound trains per weekday. The 1906 opening of the Needham Cutoff, connecting the West Roxbury Branch to the ex-NY&NE; Needham Branch, was to have a detrimental effect on Dedham service. Although Needham trains using the West Roxbury Branch did not initially make any stops on the branch (sometimes with the exception of West Roxbury itself), they began to serve local stops between West Roxbury and Forest Hills in 1912, forcing reductions in West Roxbury-Dedham service. During World War I, passenger service on all U.S. railroads was cut drastically to free up rolling stock and schedule time for military use, and the NYNH&H; was no exception. The original Dedham Branch was one of the hardest hit lines, being reduced to just ten inbound weekday trains. From 1926 to 1938, Dedham service was provided by trains looping via the West Roxbury Branch outbound and the Dedham Branch inbound, or vice versa. At some point between the discontinuance of loop service in 1938 and the partial abandonment in 1940 of the West Roxbury Branch, Dedham service via Readville was discontinued entirely. Readville-Dedham service was reinstated in 1940, after the West Roxbury-Dedham section of the West Roxbury Branch was abandoned (the Forest Hills-West Roxbury segment continued to see service from Needham and West Medway Branch trains), but was massively reduced from peak levels, comprising just one Boston-Dedham and one Readville-Dedham round trip plus a second Boston-Dedham outbound train. Dedham service was further reduced in July 1959, this time to just a single Boston-Dedham round trip. The MBTA era=Dedham Branch= The former site of Dedham station, seen here in November 2015; the station was located just in front of the overpass at far center, while the grassy field in the foreground was the site of the Dedham rail yard. The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) was formed in 1964 by expanding Boston's Metropolitan Transportation Authority (which was responsible for Boston-area bus, trolley, and rapid transit operations), largely in order to save Boston's collapsing commuter rail system. In April 1966, the MBTA started paying subsidies to the NYNH&H; for continued operations on four lines, including the Dedham Branch (service on the NYNH&H;'s two other commuter rail lines continued without a subsidy, as the NYNH&H; did not have Interstate Commerce Commission permission to discontinue those trains). Despite this, Dedham Branch service was discontinued in April 1967, a victim of poor ridership. The NYNH&H; was absorbed by Penn Central at the end of 1968. Penn Central went bankrupt less than two years later, in June 1970. To prevent the possible loss of control over rights-of-way used by (or possibly seeing future use by) its commuter rail services should Penn Central undergo liquidation, the MBTA bought a large quantity of Penn Central rights- of-way in January 1973, including both of the original B&P; Dedham routes; the Dedham Branch was still intact at this point, while the Dedham segment of the West Roxbury Branch had been completely abandoned, having been reduced to an empty right-of-way. =Franklin Line= The Franklin Line (the NY&NE;'s main line for much of its existence) passes through southeastern Dedham and, although it passes much further from the center of town than the Dedham Branch did, still serves a considerable portion of Dedham. On the segment of the Franklin Line located within Dedham, stations have existed at four locations: Dedham Corporate Center (signed as Dedham Corporate Center/128; formerly Rustcraft), Dedham Junction just to the east, Endicott, and Ashcroft. Of these four, only Dedham Corporate Center and Endicott are currently active. Just to the south in Westwood is Islington (also currently active), while Ellis station formerly stood further to the south, in far northern Norwood. Dedham Junction and Dedham Corporate=Dedham Junction= The Norfolk County Railroad completed their Midland Division from Islington to Boston in January 1855. No station was originally located at the modern location, which was in the middle of a swamp until the middle of the 20th century. The line passed through several operators and finally to the New York and New England Railroad in 1875. In 1881, the NY&NE; built a branch from Dedham Junction (near the modern station site) to Dedham to replace the Norfolk County's original route to Dedham. This allowed the railroad to (unsuccessfully) compete with the Boston and Providence Railroad's Dedham Loop for Boston-Dedham commuter traffic. The branch was closed in 1884, but reopened in 1888 by state commission order. In 1890 a short leg allowing Dedham-Islington travel for the Old Colony Railroad's Wrentham Branch was opened; trains using this route skipped Dedham Junction station. By 1898, the New Haven Railroad had acquired the Old Colony, NY&NE;, and the Boston & Providence. With the New Haven having no need for four routes to the small town of Dedham, the southern branch was soon abandoned. Service via Dedham Junction ended in 1899 and via Islington in 1904. =Rust Craft= On May 2, 1955, the New Haven Railroad opened Rust Craft station off Rustcraft Road, just east of the modern station location. The station, which served the Rust Craft greeting card plant, was the first reverse commute-focused station on the MBTA system and was \\"hailed as the start of a new era\\". Rust Craft station was closed in 1977 due to low ridership. =Dedham Corporate= The 2014-built kiss-and-ride lane in 2015 During the 1980s, the Dedham Corporate Center office park was built nearby due to convenient access to Route 128 and Route 1. On January 15, 1990, Dedham Corporate Center station was opened just off exit 14 of Interstate 95/Route 128, near the old Dedham Junction and Rustcraft stations. As well as providing access to the office park, the station provides nearly 500 parking spaces for commuters riding to Boston, as well as access to the office park for workers coming from both directions on the line. The station consists of two platforms (each a long low asphalt platform with a short high-level platform for handicapped accessibility) serving the Franklin Line's two tracks. Original plans called for a much larger \\"transportation center\\" on the site, including a 1,000 car garage on Rustcraft Road, but town officials were opposed. In late 2014, a kiss and ride dropoff lane was built on the north side of the station off Rustcraft Road. Dedham Corporate Center is the only stop between Back Bay and Foxboro on special game day service for New England Patriots home games at Gillette Stadium. Endicott The Endicott station on the Franklin Line is located off Grant Avenue near East Street. The Norfolk County Railroad opened its Boston Extension (the Midland Branch) from Islington to Boston on January 1, 1855 to end its dependence on the Boston and Providence Railroad for access to downtown Boston. East Street (later known as Endicott) was among the original stops on the extension. The line was closed from July 14, 1855 until late 1856 due to a lawsuit but has been continuously open since 1867, with service via the Midland Branch until 1898 and thereafter mostly via the B&P; mainline. =Nearby stations= Readville, located at the intersection of the NY&NE; main line with the B&P; main line (now the Providence Branch of the Providence/Stoughton Line and the Dedham Branch, is located in far southern Hyde Park, just to the east of the Dedham town line. It serves the Franklin Line and the Fairmount Line (the proximal portion of the former NY&NE; main line), but not the Providence/Stoughton Line (Providence and Stoughton trains pass through the station, but do not stop there except during service disruptions). Also in Hyde Park are Hyde Park station, somewhat to the north, which serves primarily Providence/Stoughton Line trains, as well as, formerly, Glenwood Avenue station on what is now the Fairmount Line. South of Readville, the Providence/Stoughton Line passes through far southeastern Dedham en route to Route 128 station. Although Route 128 straddles the border between Dedham and Westwood, it is located in an unpopulated area, and mostly serves park- and-riders; however, it is also the only Amtrak station located even partially in Dedham. Although both the original Norfolk County main line and, later, the West Roxbury Branch passed through Dedham, neither had any stops in Dedham apart from Dedham Square. The old Norfolk County (later NY&NE;) mainline had no stops between Islington and Dedham Center, a situation also true for the 1881-opened NY&NE; Dedham branch, while the West Roxbury Branch did have one stop between Dedham and its namesake West Roxbury station‚Äîthis was Spring Street, also located in West Roxbury, slightly to the south of West Roxbury station. The only other rail line to pass through any part of Dedham was the Needham Cutoff (running from West Roxbury to a junction with the Charles River Branch), opened in 1906 and now part of the Needham Line (as well as, prior to 1967, the Millis Branch), which briefly crosses the northern tip of Dedham en route to Needham. There have only ever been two stations on the Cutoff (both of which are still active): Hersey (formerly Bird's Hill) and Needham Junction. Although neither is located on the segment of the Needham Cutoff passing through Dedham, both are quite close to northwestern Dedham; further north, though still close, is Needham Center, located on the segment of the Needham Line which was originally part of the Charles River Branch. Accidents An 86-year-old man was killed at the station when hit by a train in 1908. A 30-year-old woman suffered severe lacerations to her left leg when she got off the wrong side of the train and was struck by a train in 1994. In 1993, a 17-year-old boy was struck by a train, but he may have already been dead before the train hit him. A 13-year-old boy was killed on the tracks in 2013, and man was killed on the tracks near the Endicott station in 2017. Special events The cornerstone of the St. Mary's Church was laid at 3:00 on October 17, 1880 by Archbishop John Williams. A crowd of between 4,000 and 5,000 people attended, and special trains were run from Boston and Norwood to accommodate all those who wished to attend. It was one of the largest gatherings in Dedham's history. In 1999, a special \\"Salute to WWII Veterans\\" saw 2,500 veterans board trains in Dedham, and then travel to South Station where the scene of their arrival home after the war was recreated. In 2015, Black Lives Matter protesters stood in front of the train running to Foxboro for a New England Patriots game to denounce racism. Proposed Orange Line extension Dedham is located in a densely-populated inner suburb of Boston just nine and a half miles from downtown, making Dedham Square a strong candidate for rapid transit service rather than either low-frequency commuter rail service (as was the case until 1967) or no service at all (as has been the case since then). The first such proposal appeared long before commuter rail service ceased, with the 1945 Metropolitan Transit Recess Commission recommending an extension of the Main Line Elevated (now the Orange Line) from Forest Hills to Dedham via West Roxbury, with five stations (Roslindale, Bellevue, Highland, and West Roxbury). Two years later, the 1947 Coolidge Commission Report recommended two extensions of the Main Line Elevated: one from Forest Hills to East Dedham via West Roxbury and Dedham, plus another from Forest Hills to Readville, as well as a possible westward relocation of the Main Line Elevated between Essex Street and Forest Hills (only the last of these ever came to pass, as part of the Southwest Corridor project).

During this time, the building had a modest structure. It was restored during the rule of Ziyadat Allah I in 821, who ordered a major expansion of the fort. During the restoration, two floors, basement and battlements were added, as well as thirty rooms for guards to live complete with bathroom and toilet. A mosque was also established on the terrace where used by the citizens of Sousse especially during the Eid al-Fitr or Eid al-Adha. It is considered among the first mosques built in the city, including the Great Mosque of Sousse. The ribat is also equipped with a water basin which collects rainwater for the use of drinking and washing. The basin was first built by Ibrahim the Great, which was expanded later by Ziyadullah. The ribat was built less than 10 years later than the Ribat of Monastir, which was first-built in 796.

It is located in the south of the village of Dion, Pieria and is often used during the summer for performances of the Olympus Festival. Location The theatre is located approximately 180 meters south of the entrance to the archaeological park. Method of construction An event of the Olympus Festival at the ancient theatre The form of the theatre corresponds to the typical theatre of Greek antiquity. It is an open-air structure that was built in a northeastern direction on the slope of a low, natural (partially heaped) hill. The orchestra was built on mashed soil and was surrounded by a drainage construction, to drain the rainwater. The drainage is uncovered, over two bridges it could be crossed by the actors. The orchestra has a diameter of about 26 meters. The stage was probably made of wood and was a bit higher than the current stage. Underneath the orchestra was an underground corridor, connecting two rooms. Unique to Hellenistic theatres was the type of seats of the auditorium, the theatron; The semicircular rows of seats were covered with 50 by 50 by 7 centimeters of mud bricks, the seats were a half brick width high. Before the beginning of the Roman period, the seats were covered with marble. The current form of the theater is the result of a modern reconstruction on the antique foundations. The seats in the spectator area are now covered with wooden boards. The gable of the theater building was adorned with a Doric entablature; the roof was covered with tiles in the Laconic style. History The Hellenistic theatre of Dion King Archelaos held a nine- day festival in honor of the nine Pieric Muses, which also included theatre competitions. He invited Euripides to Dion, who wrote the plays of Archelaos and the Bacchae. Both plays were probably also performed in Dion.Diodorus XVII,16, 3‚Äì4 The current theatre was built during the Hellenistic period, presumably during the reign of King Philip V. An earlier theatre occupied the same site, presumably destroyed during the assault of the Aetolian League, around 220 BC. Philip V immediately rebuilt the city of Dion, the shrines and the theatre. Within the structure was found a large quantity of coins depicting Philip V. In Roman times (from 168 BC) were removed useful building materials of the theatre and built a Roman theater near the sanctuary of Zeus. After completion of renovation work, the theatre has been regularly hosting performances of the Olympus Festival since 1991. Excavation history The theatre was discovered in 1806 by the English explorer William M. Leake. In 1855 the find was confirmed by the French archaeologist L√©on Heuzey.L. Heuzey et H. Daumet, Mission Archeologique de Macedoine (1876) The first test excavations were carried out in 1970 under the direction of Professor G. Bakalakis. The regular excavation work began in 1973 under the direction of Professor Pandermalis. After the works rested for two years, they were resumed in 1977 by the architect and archaeologist Professor G. Karadedos. Since the building in the Roman period, was not paid any further attention, its basic structure remained unchanged. The excavations were carried out very carefully; thus, valuable information was obtained to allow conclusions about the original condition of the complex. The orchestra, the stage, the drainage, parts of the theater building and the main part of the Cavea were found. After the excavations were completed in 1988, Karadedos implemented a study for the ‚ÄúConservation, Promotion and Temporary Re-operation of the Hellenistic Theatre of Dion‚Äù.

It refers to the ways in which makers and consumers of technology talk about and make decisions regarding technology and also the influence that technology has on discourse. Studies of the rhetoric of technology are interdisciplinary. Scholars in communication, media ecology, and science studies research the rhetoric of technology. Technical communication scholars are also concerned with the rhetoric of technology. The phrase \\"rhetoric of technology\\" gained prominence with rhetoricians in the 1970s, and the study developed in conjunction with interest in the rhetoric of science. However, scholars have worked to maintain a distinction between the two fields. Rhetoric of technology criticism addresses several issues related to technology and employs many concepts, including several from the canon of classical rhetoric, for example ethos, but the field has also adopted contemporary approaches, such as new materialism.  Definition  While the definition and scope of rhetoric is contested, scholars in the discipline, or rhetoricians, study the capacity of symbols to create change and influence perspectives. Often, rhetoricians study discourse and texts, but they also study objects. Technology is both techniques and objects that embody and enact techniques. Thus, rhetoric of technology scholars may look at texts and discourse associated with technology or techniques and technological objects. Concerns of rhetoric of technology include the influence of technology on public deliberation, conceptions of the self, and how new technologies come to be developed and adopted. Scholars who study rhetoric of technology have argued that it should be treated as distinct from the rhetoric of science. Charles Bazerman offers three distinctions between rhetoric of technology and rhetoric of science. First, unlike science, technology has always been intertwined with other clearly rhetorical endeavors, such as commerce and finance. Second, while the discourse of science often works towards specialization, the discourse of technology is pervasive. We may not all conduct experiments, but we all interact with and operate technology. Lastly, the products of technology are mostly material while the products of science are mostly symbols. Carolyn Miller argues that rhetoric of science must be treated as distinct from rhetoric of technology because technology and science differ in motivation, criteria of judgment, and values.  History  Scholars started to suggest the importance of studying rhetoric of technology in the 1970s alongside a growing interest in rhetoric of science. Thomas W. Benson and Gerard A. Hauser referred to the \\"rhetoric of technology\\" in a book review published in 1973 and noted the shared concern of rhetoric and technology with technique. In 1978 Carolyn Miller wrote ‚ÄúTechnology as a Form of Consciousness: A Study of Contemporary Ethos.‚Äù In addition to explaining why rhetoric of technology should be treated separately from science, Miller argues that technology gives rise to a particular ethos, or personal character, because it generates particular actions and a particular consciousness. She concludes that technological consciousness assumes an objective perspective that erodes ethos. Within technological consciousness, actions are right or wrong regardless of cultural possibilities because assessments are assumed to be objective. In a series of oral histories collected by the Association for the Rhetoric of Science, Technology, and Medicine, scholars familiar with both fields recognized that there has been more research addressing the rhetoric of science than comparable work on technology. Carolyn Miller suggested that one reason for the relative lack of rhetoric of technology scholarship is that it is harder to find relevant texts to analyze. Miller noted that many of the primary texts dealing with technology are private company documents.  Concepts = Materialism and New Materialism = In 1980 Langdon Winner wrote the article ‚ÄúDo Artifacts Have Politics?‚Äù Winner suggests that objects reflect and enact ideological perspectives. Winner's idea shares much in common with a materialist approach to rhetoric of technology. Materialist approaches to rhetoric of technology are related to materialism and treat technological objects the same as they may treat a text by critiquing how objects persuade and influence. Jeremy Packer and Stephen B. Wiley provide an overview of new materialist approaches to rhetoric in their book Communication Matters: Materialist Approaches to Media. Packer and Wiley conceptualize materiality as a ‚Äúcorrective‚Äù to the concept of communication as intangible. They suggest that the corrective is in response to a ‚Äúpoststructuralist impasse‚Äù in the field of communication, rhetoric, and media studies. They outline two approaches to materiality: 1) to equate materiality with physicality and approach infrastructure, body, space, and technology as fields of communication and 2) to analyze the materiality of communication itself, the physiological, mechanical, or digital media of communication. Packer and Wiley also identify key themes that are explored in materialist approaches: economy, discourse, technology, space, and bodies. = Ethos = In her 1978 article ‚ÄúTechnology as a Form of Consciousness: A Study of Contemporary Ethos,‚Äù Carolyn Miller argued that technology was fundamentally changing how individuals judge personal character. She suggested that the ultimate result of a technological consciousness would be to erode a concern with ethos as technology would prevail in presenting actions and decision as objectively right or wrong. If all decisions are objective, then there is no longer a need for judgments of character. In a 1992 article, Steven B. Katz employed Miller's \\"technological consciousness\\" to help explain the rhetoric used by members of the Nazi regime to enact the Holocaust. In 2004, Miller revisited the relationship between ethos and technology in an exploration of the impact of human-computer interaction. She explores two modes of human-computer interaction: expert systems versus intelligent agents. She argues that in both modes of interaction subjectivity blurs between the human-user and the computer, creating a hybrid (borrowing from Bruno Latour) or cyborg (borrowing from Donna Haraway). Expert systems are designed to mimic human experts; they typically draw from a deep database of information. Intelligent agent computer systems, in contrast, learn from interacting with an environment. The merger between human and computer destabilizes ethos according to Miller. As the intelligent agent model of computing has grown in popularity, Miller suggests that there has been a shift from a logos-centric to a pathos-centric ethos. Neither, she contends, provide ethics, or arete, which is a gap that rhetoric should fill. = Invention = As invention is important to the development of new technology, invention is also important to rhetoric. Along with arrangement, delivery, style, and memory, invention is one of the five canons of rhetoric, or the five key elements of a competent speech according to classic rhetorical theory. Therefore, some rhetoricians argue that the development of new technology is fundamentally rhetorical. John A. Lynch and William J. Kinsella describe how both technology and rhetoric are both concerned with creating something new from available resources and know- how. = Kairos = Kairos is an ancient Greek word that captures the idea that there is a right time for action. Carolyn Miller has suggested that the \\"right time\\" is also a central concern for technology. She uses the Japanese \\"Fifth Generation\\" computer project as a case study. Miller contends that within technological discourse kairos is both a powerful theme and useful tool of analysis. She supports her claim with an analysis of technological forecasting, which was a central feature of the Japanese computer project, and concludes that technologists employ kairos to justify investment in particular technologies.

Biography Lucille Erskine was born in St. Louis in 1879, the daughter of Samuel Erskine, Esq., a lawyer and famous orator, prosecutor attorney in St. Louis, and Marie Erskine-Robinson. Samuel Erskine addressed large audiences at Cooper's Union, New York, on the Irish questions. He was a son of Stuart Erskine, of Edinburgh, attended Beloit College, Wisconsin, and taught English at night in the German Institute of St. Louis before studying law, and later was called upon for the important work of revising its charter. He died at the early age of 42 years when Lucille Erskine was four years old. Her mother later remarried and became a teacher at the Bellefontaine Farms. Her literary education, in particular, was undertaken by her mother. Erskine graduated from Washington University in 1901, summa cum laude. She taught at the Irving School in 1902 and the following year she joined the Central High School. In 1903 the summer was spent in New England, visiting the homes and places associated with Hawthorne, Emerson and Washington Irving. The summers of '04 and '05 were passed in the University of Chicago in post-graduate work in English. In 1907 she received a degree as Master of Arts from Washington University. Her thesis on Edgar Allan Poe as a critic was published in The St. Louis Mirror, and quoted in Current Literature, New York, on the poet's centenary. Erskine travelled several successive summers in Europe doing foreign correspondence for St. Louis newspapers and the New York World. One entire summer she lived in Dublin writing weekly letters on The New Ireland. In 1909 her first story was published in The St. Louis Mirror, and commented on by the New York Dramatic Mirror; they said it was a tale of surpassing art. The story was entitled The Crystal. In 1911 she went to New York to do syndicate journalistic work for the Publishers' Press syndicate. This consisted mostly of interviews with women in new lines of endeavor which were published in papers throughout the country. She also contributed to the New York World, The Times, and the Theatre Magazine, her sketches of some of the leading women being most unusual, because of their brilliant style of delineation. However, she preferred to give up this work when she realized that she could never make it commercial and she devoted herself for six months to writing The Crossbreed; or. An Irish Story. Erskine returned to teaching in 1913 as instructor of Latin and English literature in the Central High School. She previously taught at the McKinley High School for several years. In the 1920s she moved to Hollywood to work as screenwriter. In the late 1920s she was working as press-agent. In 1929 she was the public representative of Jack Cunningham. In the 1940s census she was living in Los Angeles, as a lodger of Florence McCleary, with McCleary's mother, Anna Reynolds, and children, William G. McCleary and Rose Anne McCleary. Other lodgers include: Juanita Hicks, Yvonne Minnette, Anne L. Fritz and Thelma Lang.

His intellectual work addressed different knowledge areas, especially about the development of philosophy in Brazil, \\"aiming to establish connections between thinking and the country's social, political and economic reality throughout its history. Essay writer, critic, sociologist, biographer, besides being philosopher, which showed the diversity of his knowledge. He would spread it by teaching and via articles written in simple language and published at the most important newspapers of his time: O Estado de S. Paulo, Folha de S.Paulo (formerly called Folha da Manh√£), Jornal de S√£o Paulo, Minerva de Buenos Aires and Jornadas do M√©xico. Member of the Paulista Writers Association, also of the Biology Society (at Instituto Hist√≥rico e Geogr√°fico de S√£o Paulo) and of the Ideas History Society of Mexico\\". Cruz Costa was forced to early retire by the military dictatorship in 1965, later dying in 1978.  Life  Born in 1904, S√£o Paulo, Brazil; son of a Portuguese father and mother that descended from Italians, Jo√£o da Cruz Costa wanted to become a doctor. His interest on medicine probably came from the fact that his father, Jos√© da Cruz Costa, died young in 1922, 49 years old, by the crisis derived from syphilis, which had first shown its setbacks since 1920. Jos√© was republican and had run away from Portugal after having beaten up a monarchist adversary, having thought to have killed him. Jos√© da Cruz Costa was a successful retailer, born in the village of Palheira at the outskirts of Coimbra, Portugal, and founded the furniture store called \\"O Grande Oriente\\" (The Great Orient) in S√£o Paulo, Brazil. After his father's death, Jo√£o Cruz Costa studied medicine for two years at Faculdade de Medicina da USP (USP Medicine Faculty), intending to become a psychiatrist. Without finishing the course, Cruz Costa decided to travel to France in 1923 to study psychology and later there decided to focus his studies in philosophy. > [...] I began studying medicine, thus revealing a practical interest for the > human being, if not for him, for his health. I had done some vague studies > of philosophy with my longtime friend, prof. Henrique Geenen, to meet the > demands of the preparatory meetings. To enter the Faculty of Medicine we > were obliged to take a psychology and logic exam, which my friend and > professor of the Faculty of Medicine, Professor Guilherme Bastos Milward, > called illogical psychology. I then went to France in 1923 and entered the > preparatory course of the Medical School of Paris. One day, in a group of > Brazilians, I met Prof. Georges Dumas, who was a good friend of Brazil, who > asked me what specialization I would do in medicine. My answer was: > psychiatry. Old Dumas, who was a doctor and agr√©g√© of Philosophy, then > advised me to study philosophy and invited me to attend his amusing classes > on Sundays at the Asyle de St'Anne. I enrolled as a listener in the courses > at Sorbonne, attending classes of profs. Brunschvicg, Lalande, as well as > those of Pierre Janet in the Coll√®ge de France (Costa, 1974. pp. 87-8). According to his own words in an interview for Trans / Form / Action Magazine in 1975, Cruz Costa considered that he was influenced by what he read: > \\"In 1920 I was still not thinking autonomously, I was under the influence of > what I was reading. I think most of my generation was suffering from the > same. I read all of E√ßa de Queiroz, all of Anatole France, a lot of Balzac, > Camilo, Fialho, Machado de Assis. It was my trip to Europe that opened my > eyes to other realities ... 1930, be what it may, was a turning point for > Brazilian culture and I was, among many others of my generation, at this > crossroad. Some of them went to the right, others to the left, but all this > was confusing for one and another ... The critical spirit that Philosophy > study provides or improves, was not then the most accurate among those young > people. Thus the confusion, falacies, misunderstandings, desillusions. I > don't believe that Philosophy as an academic discipline teaches much. > However, as the Dominican Maydieu wrote, although the \\"philosopher > acquisition may seem poor, it nevertheless allows to coordinate many > wealths.\\" I thought it was worth worth paying attention to the richness of > our reality. Hence my work since then. > However, I consider my position to be an aging, outdated position. Today > there is a more universal view of human problems. Fortunately, Mario de > Andrade said, in a letter to Manuel Bandeira, that we would become more > Brazilians as we become more universal. If speculative philosophy and > practice lead us to this, they will succeed on what we had expected from > them.\\" Returning to Brazil, Jo√£o Cruz Costa (later known only by his surname, Cruz Costa) became the first student of the then recently created Faculty of Philosophy of the University of S√£o Paulo (USP), achieving the doctor's degree in 1942 and being the main responsible for the creation of the Department of Philosophy at USP. In 1951, he finally achieved the highest academic rank, becoming a professor at the same university. In 1958, he faced the outrages of the then Governor of S√£o Paulo, J√¢nio Quadros: in January of that same year, Professor Cruz Costa received a reprimand for having granted an interview to Di√°rios Associados (Brazilian newspaper), in which he had stated that the governor words were frivolous when he made reference to the then Director of FFLC Eur√≠pedes Sim√µes de Paula. This episode had strong repercussion at the press, being front cover of Folha da Manh√£ on January 3, 1958. Cruz Costa was forced to defend himself and brought the case to the STF (Brazilian Supreme Court), which granted his request on September 3, 1958, canceling his punishment . In January 1959, J√¢nio Quadros accepted the decision and the Professor Cruz Costa ironically commented in Folha da Manh√£: \\"It was always the habit of the governor to be brief, as it can be asserted by his famous notes. This time, however, he had to extend long excuses to the decision of the notable Supreme Court, which unanimously compelled him to cancel the act that had led me to appeal to that high Court of Justice.\\" On January 20, 1964, Professor Cruz Costa was obliged to testify at DOPS (Department of Order and Social Politics in Portuguese, an official governamental office to control and investigate social movements) about a manifesto supporting the registration of the Brazilian Communist Party, created in September 1961, and allegedly signed by several intellectuals, among them Cruz Costa, Caio Prado Jr., Florestan Fernandes, student leaders, lawyers, trade unionists, among others. Naturally, he declared that \\"some of the signatories have a political or philosophical position different from communists, which is, by the way, what the declarant believes in. In any case, he believes that it would be more beneficial the Communist Party to be legally accepted than being on the underground, as happens in Italy, France, England and other truly democratic countries.\\" In 1965, Cruz Costa left his teaching activities, arbitrarily removed by the supporters of the 1964 military coup. He was denounced by his more conservative university colleagues and had to take refuge in France for six months in 1964, where he taught classes. The military regime established police-military investigations (IPM, acronym in Portuguese) accusing USP students, teachers and employees, which had begun at the second semester of that year, without sparing Professor Cruz Costa: > At the Faculty of Philosophy, IPM was installed in a climate of great > hostility by students and teachers. M√°rio Schenberg, Cruz Costa and > Florestan Fernandes were questioned. Fernando Henrique Cardoso, also > accused, had already accepted the invitation to teach abroad and left the > country. During the investigation, Professor Florestan was arrested because > of a letter of protest that he handed to the colonel responsible and which > was only a defense of the dignity of being a teacher. The wave of protests > provoked by this prison seemed to have contributed to stop the IPM > questionings. On September 3, 1965, the Permanent Council of Justice of the 2nd Military Region decided by Cruz Costa pre-trial detention, as shown in his DOPS file, filed in the Public Archive of the State of S√£o Paulo. In this file, he is falsely accused as \\"communist greatly related to Russia\\". His most important contribution was Contribution to the History of Ideas in Brazil, published in 1956 and later edited and translated into several languages. In his book, Cruz Costa defended a critic and more Brazilian-oriented thinking, not necessarily rejecting foreign authors (European and American) or uncritically accepting them. His aim was for creating something new, original and Brazilian.  Work  * 1938 - Alguns aspectos da filosofia no Brasil.

Taxonomy and etymology It was first described by American zoologist Gerrit Smith Miller in 1900. Miller initially placed it into the genus Promops. The holotype for the species was collected in Chiriqu√≠ Province in Panama; it was sent to Miller by British zoologist Oldfield Thomas. Thomas had received the specimen from HJ Watson, who was the owner of extensive plantations in Panama. When Miller described a new genus of bat in 1906, Eumops, he placed Promops nanus in the new genus, renaming it Eumops nanus. Its taxonomy has been revised several times, however, with some authors considering it a subspecies of the dwarf bonneted bat. E. nanus was consistently maintained as a subspecies of the dwarf bonneted bat from 1932 until 2007, when Eger et al. recommended that it should be elevated to a species once more. Its species name nanus is from Latin meaning \\"dwarf.\\" Miller stated that the species reminded him of a miniature Wagner's bonneted bat. Description It is the smallest member of its genus, weighing . Miller characterized it as \\"essentially a miniature of Promops glaucinus.\\" Its forearm is approximately long. Its fur is reddish-brown or dark brown. Its lips are wrinkled. The ears are large and rounded, extending slightly over the forehead with their inner edges touching each other. Its tragus is large and rounded. Its calcar has a pronounced keel. Its tail extends beyond the edge of the uropatagium. Its dental formula is for a total of 30 teeth. Biology It is nocturnal, roosting in sheltered places during the day. The holotype was collected under the roof of a house where it was roosting. It is also known to roost in tree cavities. It is insectivorous, consuming moths, beetles, true bugs, and other insects. It will forage for prey over bodies of water. In one population in Mexico, late June is the most popular time for parturition. The female nurses the young, called a pup, for 6‚Äì8 weeks. Range and habitat Its range extends from southern Mexico to northern Colombia and Venezuela, with documented occurrence in Belize, Colombia, Guyana, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru, and Venezuela. Its occurs in areas of tropical thorn forests, tropical humid forests, and forest edge habitat. Conservation It is currently evaluated as least concern by the IUCN--its lowest conservation priority. It meets the criteria for this designation because it has a large range, it occurs in several protected areas, and its population is unlikely to be declining at a rapid rate. Nonetheless, it is a rarely-encountered species.

He is best known as the co-founder of Vine and the co-founder and CEO of HQ Trivia, a daily, appointment-based trivia game that was broadcast live to mobile phones.  Early life and education  Yusupov was born in Dushanbe, Tajik SSR, Soviet Union (present-day Dushanbe, Tajikistan), in 1984 to a Bukharan Jewish family. After the Revolutions of 1989 the family moved to New York, where Yusupov grew up and graduated from LaGuardia High School of Music and Art and the School of Visual Arts (SVA) with a BFA in Graphic Design.  Career = Early career = Yusupov began his career as a digital product designer at firms including Razorfish and R/GA, where he worked on projects including as the lead designer on the first version of Hulu.com in 2007. In 2008, he founded Big Human, a design and engineering studio based in New York City. Big Human's clients include Time.com, Urban Dictionary, Jetsetter, Time Warner and Fortune, among others. = Vine = In June 2012, Yusupov co- founded Vine, a looping, short-form video service. Vine was sold to Twitter in October 2012 for a reported $30 million, shortly before the service's official launch. In 2013, Vine hit number one on the App store for free downloads and become the most used video sharing application in the market at the time. Yusupov left Twitter in late 2015 after Vine was deprioritized by Twitter. Yusupov later tweeted, \\"Don't sell your company!\\" = Intermedia Labs = After leaving Twitter, Yusupov co-founded Intermedia Labs, an app studio, in 2015. The first app developed by Intermedia Labs was Hype, a platform wherein users had the ability to share a variety of multimedia content into a live broadcast. Subsequent apps developed by Intermedia Labs include Bounce, an app that allows users to \\"remix\\" videos, and HQ Trivia, an appointment-based trivia game that is broadcast live to mobile phones. = HQ Trivia = HQ Trivia, Intermedia's most successful app to-date, was released in August 2017. The game averaged 700,000-1,000,000 viewers for each broadcast. HQ was available worldwide on the iOS App Store and Google Play, with live shows targeted to North American, Australian, and UK audiences. The app took the form of a live game show, played at 9 PM Eastern Time every day, and occasionally at various other times for special themed programs (focused on specific topics such as sports, music, or word-puzzles). The host of the show asked a series of (usually) twelve multiple choice questions, each with three possible answers. Those players who answered the questions correctly within the 10-second limit moved on, and the rest were eliminated. The players that correctly answered the final question split the prize money. This prize was most recently $5,000 for most games, but it had been as high as $400,000 on one occasion. According to a 2017 Daily Beast article, Yusupov threatened to fire HQ host Scott Rogowsky if the website chose to run a profile on Rogowsky's rise to fame via HQ. Yusupov later claimed the accusations were false. HQ shut down on February 14, 2020 after its primary investors had stopped funding the company and a potential sale of HQ to an \\"established business\\" fell through. Six weeks later, on March 29, 2020, Yusupov tweeted that HQ Trivia was returning that evening.  Industry awards and recognition  Yusupov has received industry recognitions including a Tribeca Disruptive Innovation Award (2013), Variety Magazine Breakthrough of the Year Award (2014), PGA Digital VIP Award (2014), UJA Lydia Vareljan Leadership Award (2015) and the Webby Award's Webby 50 (2015). HQ Trivia won the A-Train Award for Best Mobile Game at the New York Game Awards 2018. It was also nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Interactive Program in 2019. Intermedia Labs is one of Fast Company's World's Most Innovative Companies in 2018. HQ Trivia became a finalist in the Apps and Games category for Fast Company's 2018 Innovation By Design Award.

The 10 Chaplains, from various religious faiths were sworn in at the Yaphank Correctional Facility. According to the Suffolk County Sheriff's Office, the purpose of the Sheriff‚Äôs Chaplaincy Program is to provide interfaith emotional and spiritual counsel to Sheriff‚Äôs Office employees and their families during times of need and heightened stress. The Volunteer Chaplains Program assists the Members of the Suffolk County Sheriff‚Äôs Office by providing the following services: * Render spiritual guidance, aid in fostering personal growth, and offer moral support in crisis situations, in an atmosphere of understanding and confidentiality. * Counsel and support sworn officers, civilian employees, and their family members, in personal matters and family difficulties, and provide referral resources when applicable. * Visits to sick or injured officers in the hospital or at home when requested. * Assist Sheriff‚Äôs Office personnel in making notifications to the families of officers who have been seriously injured, or upon the death of a member of the Sheriff‚Äôs Office. * Participate in religious services for deceased members and offer support to the families of the deceased. * Attend and offer prayers at official Sheriff‚Äôs Office functions: i.e. Memorial Services, graduations, and award ceremonies, etc. All requests shall be coordinated through the Director of the Chaplains Program. * When requested, assist Sheriff‚Äôs Office personnel (and Crisis Intervention Team) in emergency situations; e.g. multi-casualty incidents, officer shot or seriously injured, major disasters. * In ‚Äúemergency‚Äù situations an available \\"On Call\\" Chaplain can be reached (24 hours) by phone, through the Radio Office Supervisor.

Senior Citizen Program POD  The Suffolk County Sheriff‚Äôs Office has started a program that tries to fill the needs of older men jailed at the county correctional facility. The Senior Rehabilitation Pod Program is believed to be the first in the nation to segregate male inmates 50 and older from younger inmates to better concentrate on services more suited to the older inmates' needs. The program offers a wide range of services ‚Äî everything from 12-step programs to employment counseling to mental health services ‚Äî dedicated to improving the quality of older inmates‚Äô lives while they are in jail and when they are released.  Paws of War  The Suffolk County Sheriff‚Äôs Office partnered with Paws of War to have a Veteran Inmate work to train a rescue dog from Southampton Animal Shelter named Rocky. After 8 weeks of training, Rocky would be given to a Veteran ‚Äúon the outside‚Äù who suffers from PTSD.  Project Lifesaver  Project Lifesaver provides radio bracelets to people with cognitive impairments so that Sheriff's deputies and officers can locate them. According to Project Lifesaver International, \\"the primary mission of Project Lifesaver is to provide timely response to save lives and reduce potential injury for adults and children with the propensity to wander due to a cognitive condition.\\" The Suffolk County Sheriff's Office has dedicated Sheriff's Deputies who have been specially trained to use the high tech equipment to quickly locate lost individuals and bring them home safely  G.R.E.A.T. (Gang Resistance Education and Training)  The Suffolk County Sheriff's Office teaches local students in Gang Resistance Education And Training (G.R.E.A.T.), a national program aimed at preventing bullying, drug use, violence and gangs in schools. GREAT has reached more than 60,000 students in Suffolk since 2007. It is in 9 district and 51 Suffolk schools, including a few middle schools, which have a different, longer curriculum than in elementary schools. The instruction of life skills is the foundation of the program. In accordance with a study by Dr. Esbensen in 2000, delinquency often serves as a precursor to gang involvement, the GREAT program the focuses on providing life skills to students to help them avoid delinquent behavior and resorting to violence to solve problems. Communities need not have a gang problem in order to benefit from the program as its primary objective is prevention and is intended as an immunization against delinquency, youth violence, and gang membership.  Y.E.S. (Youth Enlightenment Seminar) Tours  In 1979 the Youth Enlightenment Seminar (YES) Tours were established at the Riverhead Correctional Facility. The Community Relations Unit of the Suffolk County Sheriff's Office, conducts the Y.E.S. Tours. Although the Sheriff's Office is interested in raising the consciousness of all Suffolk County youth regarding the realities of criminal behavior and imprisonment, the main target population is composed of those adolescents who are on the verge of becoming involved or becoming more deeply involved in criminal activity and criminal association. As part of the program, the students receive a tour of the correctional facility and engage in a dialogue with a select group of inmates who have been involved in the system and are willing to share their experiences with the visiting youth. According to the Community Relations Unit of the Suffolk County Sheriff's Office, the goals of the YES Tours are to help adolescents realize how easily antisocial criminal behavior can lead to prison, to offer support to parents, churches, and all those who are attempting to work with these adolescents, and to foster an awareness that only through work and education can life's most meaningful goals be accomplished. In November 2018, The Yaphank Correctional Facility opened its doors to student tours for the first time in a Youth Enlightenment Seminar (YES) tour. The students toured the facility and had the opportunity speak with inmates about making good choices.  Choose to Thrive  In December 2018, Toulon unveiled his Choose To Thrive Female Program Pod in the Yaphank Correctional Facility. The program uses a holistic approach to helping women behind bars get back into mainstream society. From trauma counseling to assistance for the inmates' children, the women are in a structured program where they can choose the courses or services they want. This is the first program pod offered to the female general population. Female inmates who were asked about programs in jail thought they were very helpful. They said that programs in prison showed them a better way of life.  Deconstructing the Prison Pipeline  In May 2019, Toulon and Assemblywoman Kimberly Jean-Pierre hosted a public hearing at Touro Law Center entitled ‚ÄúA Holistic Approach to Deconstructing the Prison Pipeline‚Äù. Speakers at this public hearing discussed the impact of parents' and family members' incarceration on children and siblings, how race and poverty feed the prison pipeline, childhood trauma and how it relates to delinquency in youth, and effective interventions. Acting Supreme Court Justice Fernando Camacho was present at this hearing, and made the case for \\"safe spaces\\" for children to receive \\"wraparound\\" services with job training, counseling, and recreational activities to help keep these kids from offending. Many children who enter \\"the pipeline\\" are victims of poverty, abuse, or neglect. They often act out in school and are suspended due to \\"zero tolerance\\" policies. After being suspended, they end up being \\"pushed out\\" of the education system and end up in the correctional system, all stemming from a small in-school infraction, such as bringing nail clippers or scissors to school. Deconstructing the Prison Pipeline believes that students should be educated, not incarcerated. Sheriff Toulon spoke to Greater Bay Shore about the task force. ‚ÄúDeconstructing the prison pipeline is about mobilizing all facets of the community to prevent juvenile delinquency and crime,‚Äù said Toulon. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about implementing practical prevention and intervention solutions that will improve people‚Äôs lives and make our communities safer.‚Äù Inmates who were at the Deconstructing the Prison Pipeline conference spoke positively of their experiences in jail, saying that the programs they were involved in while incarcerated showed them a better way of life. but they also said that had there been some kind of intervention earlier while they were in school they could have altered the path that led to their incarceration in the first place.

History  EASPD was founded in 1996 with 5 partners. As the organisation began to grow, it held its first conference in 1999 in Dublin, Ireland, the topic being ‚ÄúPartnership‚Äî the key to quality services‚Äù. By 2001, EASPD represented 5,000 services, and had become a member of European NGOs Social Platform and ECAS (Euro Citizen Advice Service), and had signed cooperation agreements with IASSID and Inclusion Europe. Over the next 10 years, EASPD continued to grow, and until now has built a network that currently represents over 17.000 support services for persons with disabilities and their families all over Europe. The services represented cover the entire life cycle of the individual and include early intervention, education, employment, housing, leisure, culture, day-care, elder and residential support services. In 2011 EASPD, together with Eurodiaconia, Workability Europe, EPR, Solidar, FEANTSA, CEDAG, Caritas (joined later), and the Red Cross (joined later) launched Social Services Europe, a European platform for not for profit providers of health and social services. In 2013 EASPD was accredited as NGO to the Conference of States Parties to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and launched its first \\"Employment for All\\" Award. By 2015, EASPD represented over 12,000 service providers, became a member of EDF, and entered into a partnership with the Zero Project. In 2016 EASPD moved its headquarters to Rue du Commerce, Handelsstraat in Brussels and elected its current president, James Crowe.

The survey was created in order to understand the demographics of land ownership within the Appalachian mountain region. This survey spanned the area across 420 different counties from Georgia to Maine. The main focus of the survey was to identify patterns within land ownership, specifically absentee owners and the effects on regional development in the areas. It is mandatory for agricultural land owners in the United States to participate in these surveys to account for their production, financing and inputs within each state.  Absentee ownership  Absentee owners are considered to be private companies within the coal, timber, petroleum industries as well as some National and State parks. Private companies came to the Appalachian mountains to invest in the land with hopes to profit off of the resources. For example, 93 percent of the land owners in West Virginia were absentee owners by the year 1810. As of 1981, absentee owners in the Appalachian mountain regions own a total of 51 percent of the land. In 80 counties throughout Appalachia, these private companies own land in almost half of the surface area; 43 percent of the land is owned by private companies and 8 percent is owned by the Government.  Natural resource mining  The Appalachian region is well known for its abundance of coal, natural gas, and many other natural resources that have led to the extraction of these resources. In the mid 1800s, the demand for coal grew, which caused an abundance of coal companies to set up mine sites throughout the Appalachian Mountains. During this time, the Appalachian region was the top producer of coal for the United States. Up until 1990, Appalachia was producing most of the counties coal with West Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Kentucky being the top production states. West Virginia alone produces nearly half of the regions coal and holds the highest rate of coal employment.Hodge, Dan (March 2016). \\"Appalachian Coal Industry, Power Generation and Supply Chain\\" (PDF). Appalachian Regional Commission.  Taxation system failure  Corporations normally have large deductions on their taxes in comparison to the average land owner, so the land under possession of absentee owners is taxed significantly less. Companies mining in the Appalachians take up a large portion of land, which leaves a significantly smaller amount of tax revenue than if the majority was owned by locals. Property taxes are a primary source for government supported projects managing everything from roads and education to welfare. Property values have gone up over 300 percent since 1977, dramatically increasing the cost of property taxes. Due to the low taxes the natural wealth of the area, there is a lack of monetary support for civil services.  Economic growth  The dramatic rise of coal brought many private companies into rural Appalachia. These private companies came to the Appalachia region with hope to invest in and profit from the beautiful, yet valuable resources. Railroad companies, steel mills, textiles factories, and steam boats were the biggest users of coal during the Industrial Revolution.  Cultural effects  In a study done by Dr. David Rouse in 1995, he concluded that the large amount of corporate land ownership in the Appalachians restricted the public access to land, allowed corporations to have more political influence, and decreased civic engagement within the area. Although the Appalachian mountains are filled with an abundance of resources, these areas are often notoriously poor. In 1981 it was found that absentee owners and corporations held up to 43% of the land in the Appalachian mountain region. While these corporations were benefitting from the land, proportionally they were putting very little back into the area in terms of taxes paid. Corporations take up a very large portion of flat land which would be useful to build houses on, and pay a far smaller percentage of tax on that land than the average homeowner would. Many Appalachian Mountain Communities cannot expand their population due to the lack of space to build homes and an inability to create new infrastructure with less tax revenue.

Biography  Yuste's interest in neuroscience arose early, inspired by books like Santiago Ram√≥n y Cajal's Los T√≥nicos de la Voluntad: Reglas y consejos sobre investigaci√≥n cient√≠fica and supported by his parents. He studied medicine at the Universidad Aut√≥noma de Madrid and its Fundaci√≥n Jim√©nez D√≠az Hospital (1982-1987). Finding the treatment and understanding of mental diseases as \\"primitive\\", Yuste decided that instead of practicing medicine he would work on laying the scientific basis for future treatments through basic biological research. He worked for two summers (1985/86) in the laboratory of the Nobel laureate Sydney Brenner at the University of Cambridge, but the budget cuts of Margaret Thatcher's government made him look for PhD opportunities in the United States. In 1987 he was admitted to Rockefeller University and joined the group of Nobel laureate Torsten Wiesel, working with Lawrence C. Katz. There he developed the calcium imaging technique to measure and monitor the activity of neuronal populations. The technique is based on the fact that when an electric signal depolarizes a neuron, its calcium channels are activated, thus allowing Ca2+ ions to enter the cell. If one brings a calcium-sensitive dye into neurons in the brain, one can detect under the microscope when a neuron is active. The technique is detailed in Yuste's doctoral thesis Optical studies of calcium dynamics in developing neocortical neurons (1992), which was directed by Wiesel and Katz. It has since become one of the technical pillars of neurobiology. Yuste then moved to David Tank's group at Bell Laboratories where he worked four years as a postdoc, combining calcium imaging with the two-photon microscope invented by Winfried Denk and, through discussions with John Hopfield and David Tank, becoming convinced of the importance of neural networks (rather than just single neurons) for understanding the functioning of the brain (connectionism). In 1996 Yuste became an assistant professor in the Department of Biological Sciences at Columbia University, obtaining tenure in 2002 and becoming a full professor in 2006. Since 2004 he is also co-director of the Kavli Institute for Brain Science at Columbia University and since 2014 the director of Columbia's Neurotechnology Center. Since 2019 he has been the Director of the NeuroRights Initiative. In 2013 Yuste received the NIH Director's Pioneer Award with a grant of US$2.5 million to fund research to test the hypothesis of the cortex as a random circuit using novel two-photon imaging methods in a large-scale study of the mouse cortical microcircuit. As of 2018 Yuste has published more than 200 papers. According to Google Scholar he has been cited more than 34,000 times for an h-index of 102. As an Ikerbasque Research Professor, Yuste works several weeks per year at the Donosti International Physic Center in San Sebastian, Spain. In addition, he has served, or currently serves, on the scientific advisory board of several institutes, foundations, and companies in the US, Spain, and Israel, such as the Fundaci√≥n Gaeda, the Allen Institute, the Biophysics Institute BIOFISIKA a joint Research Centre of the Spanish National Research Council and the University of the Basque Country or Harvard's Conte Center. Yuste has served on the editorial board of numerous professional journals, among them Frontiers in Neural Circuits (chief editor, 2006-2013) and Cerebral Cortex (associate editor since 1998).  Brain Activity Map and BRAIN Initiative  In 2011 at a meeting with funding agencies, Yuste proposed the goal of developing technologies to \\"record every spike from every neuron\\" and then co-authored together with George M. Church, Paul Alivisatos, Ralph Greenspan, and Michael Roukes a white paper to elaborate this idea as a large-scale scientific project (then called the \\"Brain Activity Map Project\\") modeled on the Human Genome Project. Two years later then president Barack Obama announced the US BRAIN Initiative that now funds neuroscience research in over 500 laboratories and is slated to last until 2025. Yuste has warned against spreading the funds of the initiative too thin and argued that a focused effort is required to develop the technologies needed for large-scale, real-time brain imaging with single-neuron resolution that would be made available at observatory-like centers to the scientific community. Yuste has also spearheaded the development of ethical guidelines for neurotechnology and AI (ref Goering 2016 and Yuste 2017), proposing that five new NeuroRights be added to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, to protect human mental privacy, identity, agency and equal access to cognitive enhancement and also prevent algorithm biases. In 2018, professor Yuste was awarded the T√§llberg/Eliasson Foundation prize due to his commitment to exploring the ethical implications of using emerging AI in the field of neurotechnology. This prize, which is \\"awarded annually to outstanding leaders who demonstrate the willingness and capacity to address the complexity of 21st-century challenges in innovative, risk-taking, and ethical ways, and whose work is global in aspiration or implication and is rooted in universal values\\" is a substantial honor.

Bowdich's grandfather was a deputy chief for the Albuquerque Fire Department. Bowdich attended high school at Temple Baptist Academy, graduating in 1987. Bowdich earned a bachelor of science in criminal justice from New Mexico State University in 1991. He later received a masters degree in leadership from the McDonough School of Business at Georgetown University.  Career  Bowdich was a police officer with the Albuquerque Police Department from 1991 to 1995, where he patrolled the Southeast and North Valley area commands and served as a detective in the North Valley. Bowdich joined the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 1995 in San Diego, California field office, where he served as a SWAT team member and investigated violent crimes and gangs. Bowdich managed an investigation that resulted in convictions against street gang members in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California. Bowdich received a promotion to the headquarters of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 2003, serving in the Safe Streets and Gang Unit. After two years at headquarters, Bowdich transferred to supervising a multi-agency gang task force in San Diego. Bowdich managed agents investigating drug cases and racketeering cases against the Mexican Mafia, Bloods, Crips, and Hells Angels. In 2009, Bowdich became in charge of the field office in San Diego. Bowdich noticed that there was a trend of kidnapping committed by Mexican cartel-related criminal enterprises, so he initiated an interagency squad that built a large-scale criminal case against 43 members and associates of the cartel who were kidnapping individuals in and around San Diego. Bowdich also supervised the investigations into the murders of two United States Border Patrol agents. By 2011, Bowdich was the Federal Bureau of Investigation supervisor in San Diego, managing 100 agents and officers around Mexico‚ÄìUnited States border.Miroff, Nick (February 28, 2011). \\"U.S. Firms Working Abductions in Mexico\\".

Though she won her seat in six consecutive election cycles, with a substantial majority each time she ran, Joshua was often the target of politically-based inquiries and investigations. She served in the legislature from 1958 to 1979 and simultaneously on the Executive Council from 1960 when she was appointed as the Minister of Social Services. Joshua served from 1961 to 1964 and again from 1967 to 1972 as a Minister without portfolio, before being appointed as Parliamentary Secretary and later Leader of the Opposition. Early life Ivy Inez McQueen was born on 25 December 1924 in Grenada to Cecile (n√©e Neckles) McQueen. After receiving a basic education, she moved to Trinidad and Tobago, where she met Ebenezer Joshua. The couple relocated to British Guiana in 1943, where they were married before returning two years later to Trinidad to work as union organizers. Working in the trade union movement founded by Tubal Uriah Butler, the Joshuas were invited to return to Ebenezer's homeland, of Saint Vincent in March 1951 to assist George Hamilton Charles in organizing the laborers of the United Workers, Peasants and Rate Payers Union (UWPRPU). Career Charles and Ebenezer Joshua formed the political arm of the UWPRPU, which they called the Eighth Army of Liberation. Ivy Joshua was one of the key organizers of the movement, mobilizing workers to participate in the first elections after universal suffrage was granted on the island in 1951. In addition, she worked as a seamstress and ran a store, which held a liquor license. After winning the election in a landslide victory, the Eighth Army dissolved over political differences. Joshua was instrumental in assisting Ebenezer with the formation of the Federated Industrial Allied Workers Union (FIAWU), representing agricultural and waterfront workers, in 1952. With the development of the FIAWU, a new political party, People‚Äôs Political Party, (PPP) was launched. Joshua walked from village to village with Ebenezer, presenting their plea for labor organization and decolonization. She also led strikes between 1951 and 1957 to gain recognition for the union and to improve the conditions of the workers, primarily in the sugar factories. In 1954, the Joshuas' new party won three of the eight seats and in the following election, Joshua stood as a candidate in the elections, becoming one of the first women to contest an election. On 24 September 1957, Joshua was confirmed as the assembly member for the North Windward Electoral District of Saint Vincent, becoming the first woman to serve in the island's Legislative Council. As both she and her husband won seats in the election, they became the first couple in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines (and possibly the British West Indies) to hold office at the same time. Labor relations had cooled and there were no strikes between 1957 and 1961. Joshua was appointed as Minister of Social Services, overseeing education and housing in 1960. She was reelected for the same district in 1961, appointed as a Minister without portfolio and repeated the feat in 1964, winning by wide margins. In 1962, she was one of the leaders of the FIAWU strike over holiday pay at the Mt. Bentinck Sugar Factory, which eventually led to the closure of the plant. Joshua was forced to resign her position in the cabinet in 1964, though she retained her legislative seat, when the Colonial Secretary, Duncan Sandys and George Thompson, MP of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom brought questions in the London Parliament over her handling of the Public Works Department. Though standard practice in the 1960s for ministers across the Caribbean to trade jobs in the public works department for political support, when Joshua tried to place her supporters, she was called before a commission of inquiry. She resigned, but was found guilty of irregularities and misuse of public funds. That same year, she and Ebenezer worked to resolve a labor dispute for the dockworkers who were members of FIAWU. Installation of a conveyor belt from the dock to the ships, had caused alarm over whether dockworkers would be discharged and the Joshuas were able to negotiate an agreement to protect the workers. In 1966, Joshua was reelected with 82% of the vote. A petition was filed contesting the election by Milton Cato, of the Saint Vincent Labor Party, (SVLP), which had lost the election to Ebenezer Joshua's PPP by one vote. Cato alleged that Ivy Joshua was illiterate and without being able to read and write was incapable of understanding parliamentary procedure. Counter-charges were filed against SVLP member Levi Latham by Ebenezer Joshua, alleging he too was illiterate. Both Joshua and Latham were required to take literacy tests in October 1966. Most of the public saw the repeated attacks on Joshua as a witch-hunt by her political opponents and ironically Cato was later accused of corruption for trading votes for jobs, which he had berated Joshua for having done. In 1969, Joshua was arrested along with five other people and charged with conspiring to set fire to the Public Works Department. The charges appeared to be politically motivated, as at the time Saint Vincent had just gained political autonomy, as one of the West Indies Associated States, though it would not gain full independence for another decade. The entire Caribbean region at the time was marked by unrest, with an increase in British military activity to suppress political upheaval. A British frigate was sent from Bermuda at the time of Joshua's arrest to try to reduce the tension. On the day of Joshua's trial, a mass protest was held, calling for new elections, with the demonstrators marching to the Kingstown Court House. Both of the Joshuas, boycotted the statehood celebration, in protest over the failure to call new elections once St. Vincent's status from colony changed. The election of 1972 resulted in a tied vote with each of the parties receiving six seats. A unity government, with an independent, James Fitz-Allen Mitchell as Premier was formed and Joshua was appointed as the Parliamentary Secretary by the Governor Rupert Godfrey John. When the unity government fell apart in 1974, new elections were held and Joshua was again elected. She vehemently opposed forming another unity government and was appointed as Leader of the Opposition. As her husband had also been reelected to his seat and agreed to cooperate in a unity government, it was the first time in Saint Vincent political history that a husband and wife served on opposing sides in Parliament. Joshua won her seat in six consecutive elections, each time winning by a substantial majority, amid staunch opposition and politically- based attacks. Her first loss came in the 1979 election, when both she and Ebenezer lost their bids. In 1986, Joshua was recognized by the National Council of Women of SVG for her pioneering role in politics and as an advocate for the working class. Death and legacy Joshua died in 1992, a year after Ebenezer. Though he was nominated as a National Hero of the islands, her role as his partner and as one of the few women who successfully broke political molds went largely unrecognized until the 21-st century. A highway in northern Saint Vincent bears her name.

Thomas Wallace was one of the leading British scientists in the study of the chemistry of grass and its conservation, in collaboration with Welsh Plant Breeding station, 1919 and 1939. Due to his published articles (usually found in Welsh Journal of Agriculture), he demonstrated his ability, leadership and dedication as an agricultural scientist. His work showed clear analyses which was of tremendous value to the discovery of the nutritive value of grasses, clovers and other grassland plants. He continued his research to the end of his life but it failed to receive the attention it deserved due to his unassuming nature. He married Helena Teresa Hughes and they had one son.

Left: NTNU's rector Gunnar Bovim Jackson has continued to argue that an open and inclusive study of religions and other worldviews in state funded schools is intrinsic to a broadly based liberal education, while also contributing instrumentally to the personal development of students and to social aims, such as fostering appreciation for the human rights principle freedom of religion and belief.Jackson, R.

The Future of Religious Education in Europe, pp 7‚Äì18. San Domenico di Fiesole: European University Institute. (Open access e-book) Drawing on ideas and methods from his ethnographic studies, Jackson developed the interpretive approach to religious education, which examines the dynamic relationship between individuals, the various kinds of groups they relate to, and wider religious traditions.Jackson, R. (1997) Religious Education: An Interpretive Approach. London: Hodder and Stoughton. It was influenced by work in recent social anthropology, hermeneutics, religious studies, intercultural studies and social psychology, and deals with issues of representing and interpreting religions fairly and accurately. It also includes a reflexive dimension in which the learner or researcher reflects on the implications of new learning for their own personal development. Professor John M. Hull described Religious Education: An Interpretive Approach as ¬´a major contribution to the academic and professional study of religious education.¬ª¬´Religious Education: An Interpretive Approach, Robert Jackson, Hodder & Stoughton, 1997, 0‚Äì340‚Äì68870‚ÄìX.

Jackson argues that the educational potential of the study of religion in state-funded schools has been underestimated; state schools should not be thought of as places of secular education, but as providing a pluralist context for educational development, and an environment encouraging dialogue.

(pronounced \\"Irini\\"). Margaret Elizabeth Irene Gilbert was born in Main Street, Thurles, County Tipperary to Jennie (n√©e Knox) and William Charles, a commercial traveller in the printing and stationery trade. Irene was an Irish fashion designer based in Dublin. Ireland's first couturier, she was a member of the \\"Big Three\\" Irish fashion designers, along with Sybil Connolly and Raymond Kenna/Kay Peterson. Designing for royalty and high society, she was famous for her work and friendship with Grace Kelly. She was the first woman to run a successful fashion business in Ireland, operating out of a shop on St Stephen's Green on the southside of the city. Early life Gilbert was born in Thurles, County Tipperary in 1908. She is living on the Mall in Waterford on the 1911 census. Her father is forty and her mother twenty-two. Her parents have been married for three years and she is their only child. Charles Edward Gilbert and Jane Knox were married in St. Pancras, London in December 1907. Work Gilbert's career in the fashion industry began when she ran a dress shop on Wicklow Street in Dublin. She then went to London to train under a court dressmaker, before returning to open a hat shop on Dublin's North Frederick Street in the late 1940s Having moved to St Stephen's Green, Gilbert opened a shop there in 1947. She began selling clothes under her own label from 1950, since her first show took place in Restaurant Jammet. She was known for her work with silk, tweed, linen and Carrickmacross lace. Future celebrated designer, Pat Crowley, worked for Gilbert for seven years from 1960, as a designer as well as a sales and marketing specialist. The quality of the work contributed to Dublin's reputation as a \\"must stop-over\\" for the international fashion media. She designed one of the ten variations of the Aer Lingus uniform. Gilbert closed the business in 1969 and emigrated to Malta. She later moved to Cheltenham in England where she died in 1985. Legacy Gilbert's creations were prized by Anne, Countess of Rosse whose collection of Gilberts are now curated at Birr Castle. In January 2018, Gilbert's life and work was the subject of an exhibition at the Little Museum of Dublin.

A Sailortown is a district in seaports that catered to transient seafarers. These districts frequently contained boarding houses, public houses, brothels, tattoo parlours,\\"Tattoos, Tars and Sailortown Culture,\\" Port Towns & Urban Culture print shops, shops selling nautical equipment, and religious institutions offering aid to seamen; usually there was also a police station, a magistrate's court and a shipping office. Because it took several days, in the past, to unload ships, crews would spend this time in sailortown. These were \\"generic locations‚Äîinternational everyplaces existing in nearly every port.\\" Cecily Fox Smith wrote that 'dockland, strictly speaking, is of no country‚Äîor rather it is of all countries'\\". Sailortowns were places where local people, immigrants, social and religious reformers, and transitory sailors met. Sailortowns were found in major seaports, including London, Liverpool, Glasgow, Belfast, Bristol, Cardiff, Hull, Tyneside, Portsmouth, Plymouth, Amsterdam, Antwerp, Hamburg, New York, San Francisco and many others in Europe, North and South America, West Indies, the East, Africa, and Australia. Modern methods for handling cargo such as roll on, roll off techniques, and containerization means that mariners spend less time ashore and this has led to the decline of sailortowns.BBC Radio Merseyside\\"Share your memories of Liverpool's Sailortown\\", .

Sailors were given their wages as a lump sum at the end of their voyage, and were exploited by crimps and other 'friends' of seafarers: \\"crimps essentially took control of seafarers' wages and provided them with lodging and entertainment, like an agent.\\" Crimps were also frequently agents for, or owners of, boarding-houses, and they might also have a connection with public houses, brothels, places of entertainment, and places to eat. An extreme version of crimping was shanghaiing, when seamen \\"would be rendered senseless ‚Äì either by drink, drugs or blunt instrument ‚Äì and then were signed-on to a ship\\". Folksinger and author Stan Hugill published, in 1967, a book on this topic, Sailortown, but his account has been criticized for \\"relying almost exclusively on generalisation, titillation and shock- value\\". During the nineteenth century, throughout the world, religious denominations established institutions in sailortowns to cater to the spiritual needs of sailors. One example was the Liverpool Sailors' Home project which was launched at a public meeting called by Liverpool‚Äôs Mayor in October 1844. Such institutions provided such things, as \\"board, lodging and medical attendance, at a moderate charge\\" to protect seamen them extortion, as well as \\"to promote their moral, intellectual, and professional improvement; and to afford them the opportunity of receiving religious instruction\\". In addition the Liverpool Sailors‚Äô Home had a reading-room, library, and savings bank.Nicholas David Wong, \\"The Rushworths of Liverpool: A Family Music Business. Commerce, Culture and the City\\". Thesis submitted in accordance with the requirements of the University of Liverpool for the degree of Doctor in Philosophy by March 2016. In 1859, in Sydney, Australia, a provisional committee of citizens was formed with the object of building a Sailors‚Äô Home to provide them with comfortable accommodation while the seamen were ashore. Construction began in 1863, using a design similar to sailors‚Äô homes in other seaports, on land in George Street North in the Rocks area. The seaports= Liverpool = Until the 1970s \\"much of Liverpool's sailortown area was clustered around the city centre, extending inland from Albert, Canning and Salthouse Docks\\". The area included \\"a Sailor's Home and Seamen's Mission to dance halls, bars, boarding houses and shops with most connected to the port\\". Found within this district, Liverpool's Sailors' Home, was designed to provide safe, inexpensive lodging for sailors, and to offer educational and recreational opportunities, in contrast to the temptations on offer in the docklands area. It was open for business in Canning Place, Liverpool, England, from December 1850 to July 1969.Images of the home ; Images. American writer Herman Melville describes Liverpool's sailortown in his semi-autobiographical novel Redburn (1849).Andrew Lees, Liverpool: The Hurricane Port. New York: Random House, 2013 = London = London's Sailortown \\"was clustered in a narrow strip of houses, taverns and slums on the north bank of the Thames, down river from the Tower of London, but also included \\"the parishes of Wapping, Shadwell and Stepney\\". This included the area known as Ratcliff, originally known for shipbuilding but from the fourteenth century more for fitting and provisioning ships. In the sixteenth century various voyages of discovery were supplied and departed from Ratcliffe, including those of Willoughby and Frobisher. By the early seventeenth century it had the largest population of any village in Stepney, with 3500 residents. Located on the edge of Narrow Street on the Wapping waterfront it was made up of lodging houses, bars, brothels, music halls and opium dens. This overcrowded and squalid district acquired an unsavoury reputation with a large transient population. =Belfast= Sailortown was a working-class community in the docks area of Belfast, Northern Ireland. Established in the mid-19th century on partly reclaimed land, it had a mixed Protestant and Catholic population.Clarke, L. (2017). Asher, A Fictional Biography. Wild Rose Press, Incorporated. p. 201. ; Morgan, A. (1991). Labour and Partition: The Belfast Working Class, 1905‚Äì1923. Pluto Irish library. Pluto Press. p. 95. . Urban redevelopment in the late 1960s resulted in Sailortown's eventual demolition; only two churches, several pubs, and three houses remain of the once bustling waterfront enclave.Van Damme, I.; De Munck, B.; Miles, A. (2017). Cities and Creativity from the Renaissance to the Present. Routledge Advances in Urban History. Taylor & Francis. p. 313. ; Rolston, B. (1991). Politics and painting: murals and conflict in Northern Ireland. Fairleigh Dickinson University Press. p. 55. . = Cardiff's Tiger Bay = Norwegian Church Cardiff, in Tiger Bay's sailortown During the nineteenth century as Cardiff's coal exports grew, so did its population; as dockworkers and sailors from across the world settled in neighbourhoods close to the docks, known as Tiger Bay (see also Butetown). This included immigrants from a wide variety of nationalities including Norwegian, Somali, Yemeni, Spanish, Italian, Caribbean, and Irish, helped to create the unique multicultural character of the area.The Tiger Bay Story by Neil M.C.Sinclair, published by Dragon & Tiger Enterprises, Tiger Bay had a reputation for being a tough and dangerous area. Merchant seamen arrived in Cardiff from all over the world, only staying for as long as it took to discharge and reload their ships. Consequently, the area became the red-light district of Cardiff, and many murders and lesser crimes went unsolved and unpunished, as the perpetrators had sailed away. However, locals who lived and stayed in the area describe a far friendlier place. Following the Second World War there was a major decline in the importance of the docks and therefore of sailortown. In 1999, the area was redeveloped by the Cardiff Bay Development Corporation. This resulted in the controversial renaming of the area \\"Cardiff Bay\\". =San Francisco= According to author Daniel Bacon, daytime San Francisco's \\"old Barbary Coast was quiet, save for a few clothing shops, maritime businesses and auction houses\\". However in the evening it was dangerous a place of opium dens, crimping joints, bars, brothels and gambling dens, where unsuspecting sailors, \\"after having completed a long journey were slipped Mickey Finns ‚Äî whiskey laced with a dollop of opium ‚Äî and shanghaied on two-year long voyages. Skippers paid crimps up to $75 a head to supply able-bodied hands to crew their vessels\\".\\"SAN FRANCISCO MARITIME HISTORY: FROM THE BARBARY COAST TO TODAY‚ÄôS EMBARCADERO,\\" San Franscisco Travel. It was not until the 1860s when sailors gave the district its name, and began to refer to it as the Barbary Coast.Barker, Malcolm: More San Francisco Memoirs,1852-1899 ‚Äì The Ripening Years, Londonborn Publications, 1996, p. 46 The term \\"Barbary Coast\\" is borrowed from the Barbary Coast of North Africa. That African region was also notorious for the same kind of predatory dives which would target sailors, as had been done on San Francisco's Barbary Coast.Federal Writers of WPA: San Francisco in the 1930s ‚Äì The WPA Guide to the City by the Bay, University California Press, 2011, p. 214 Miners, sailors, and others hungry for female companionship and bawdy entertainment streamed into San Francisco's Barbary Coast. The fact that San Francisco functioned as a port city meant that it was able to sustain large transient populations that were less likely to conform to social rules and regulations.

Blayton (-1977) was a radio entrepreneur, civil rights activist, professor, accountant, and businessman. Blayton founded WERD-AM in Atlanta, Georgia, which was the first radio station owned and programmed by African Americans. In 1995, he posthumously entered the National Radio Hall of Fame.  Early Life  Jesse B. Blayton, Sr. was born in Fallis, Oklahoma, on December 6, to Lester B. Blayton and Mattie E. Carter. He attended Langston University in Oklahoma, between 1915 and 1918.  Career  From 1925 to 1930 Blayton was employed at Morehouse College, a historically black college in Atlanta, Georgia, as a professor in accounting. There, he became a popular mentor for young African-Americans studying the subject. He was founding president of Georgia's Mutual Federal Savings and Loan Association between 1925 and 1971. In 1928 Blayton successfully passed the Georgia accounting examination. This marked Blayton as the first African-American in the state of Georgia to be a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) and the fourth black CPA in the history of the United States. From 1930 until 1970, Blayton was Professor of Accounting at the University of Atlanta, where he became recognized as the \\"Dean of Negro Accountants\\" for his encouragement of young African-Americans to pursue the profession. It was difficult for African-Americans to become CPAs, as the occupation remained largely closed to them until the late 20th century. In 1932, Blayton graduated with a Bachelor's degree in business education from the Walton School of Commerce in Chicago. He then attended graduate school at the University of Chicago for business administration and graduated with his MBA in 1935. Blayton became co-owner and co-founder of Atlanta's first black night club \\"Top Hat\\" in 1937. Despite this, Saturday nights were still reserved for whites only. He was also part-owner of Brown Boy Bottling Co. = WERD = Blayton purchased WERD in 1949 for $50,000, making it the first radio station to be both owned and programmed by African- Americans. Its programming was oriented towards African-Americans, pioneering a new program format composed of mostly rhythm and blues music. WERD's other programming included jazz and gospel music, as well as public service programs, educational shows, church services, radio plays, and community news. Jesse Blayton Jr. served as WERD's program director and hired black employees such as the popular disc jockey and radio personality \\"Jockey Jack\\" Gibson. He felt that by hiring black employees and reaching a more African-American audience, WERD would keep money circulating within the community. Blayton and his radio station publicized the civil rights movement by acting as an outlet for information about the movement and for speeches by prominent civil rights leaders. This included Martin Luther King Jr., whose Southern Christian Leadership Conference shared the same building as WERD. Dr. King often visited the studio to announce the activities of his organization. Blayton's approach to the Civil Rights Movement was through the use of politics, and his conservative approach, which led to criticism and praise. In 1950 WERD was considered a milestone for civil rights in America. WERD was so successful that in mid-1954 the Blaytons purchased an AM station, KREL in Baytown TX. They sold it four years later.  Later life  Blayton retired and sold WERD in 1968, but remained an active community leader until his death on September 7, 1977. He died on the street, coming from a barber shop in Atlanta, Georgia. He was buried in South-View Cemetery in Atlanta. He was posthumously inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame in 1995, for making radio history and providing a platform for civil rights activists.

It is found in North America, especially in the eastern United States. It is a pest of Kentucky bluegrass, other grasses, corn and grain crops. Description The adult bluegrass billbug is about in length, a third of which is the long, downward-curving snout or proboscis. The thorax bears deep puncture marks and the elytra have longitudinal grooves. These billbugs are usually some shade of brown, grey or black. Distribution and habitat The bluegrass billbug is native to North America. Its range extends from Ontario and Nova Scotia southwards to Idaho, New Mexico and Florida. It is commonest in the east of its range. It is found in grassland, including lawns, especially in association with Kentucky bluegrass, as well as in corn and other grain crops. Ecology The adult beetle feeds on seedlings and tender young shoots of various grasses. It seldom flies, preferring to scramble among the crop plants. Although Kentucky bluegrass seems to be its favored host plant, it will also feed on timothy-grass, redtop grass, maize, wheat and other small grain crops. Its feeding leaves a characteristic row of identical small holes across an unfolding leaf-blade. Breeding takes place in the late spring and there is a single generation. The female chews a hole in the stem of a grass plant and deposits a single egg inside. The developing white, legless, larva hollows out the inside of the stem and feeds around the root crown. The plant often wilts, and can be distorted, weakened or even killed by the actions of adults and larvae. When fully developed, the larva pupates, either in the stem or in the soil, and overwinters as an adult or as a pre-emergent adult inside the pupal case. Adult females may lay between 40 and 200 eggs over the course of one to three months. ReferencesFurther reading * Arnett, R.H. Jr., M. C. Thomas, P. E. Skelley and J. H. Frank. (eds.). (2002).

He was part of the Asociaci√≥n Arte Concreto-Invenci√≥n. He was the founder of the Perceptivist group.  Early life and education  Lozza was born in the town of Alberti in the Buenos Aires Province of Argentina, to parents Rafael Carlos Lozza, a designer, muralist, painter, paper-maker and musician, and Emma Lozza (n√©e Righetti). Lozza's father had emigrated from the Lombardy region of Italy and his mother was the daughter of Italian immigrants. Lozza had two brothers: Rafael Obdulio Lozza and Rembrandt Van Dyck Lozza. The family faced economic hardship after a tornado destroyed a theatre and other buildings Rafael Lozza had been working on. They continued to face economic hardship as Lozza's mother suffered from deteriorating mental health issues, which led to her being institutionalized in 1920, after which she escaped and disappeared. In 1923, Lozza's father committed suicide. Lozza and his brothers went to live with their maternal aunt, Amalia Righetti, and uncle, where they worked on their farm. In 1925, Lozza left school. He did farm work during harvest time and worked as muleteer and bricklayer. Lozza began to work as a painter and paper-cutter, setting up a business with his brothers that gave them economic stability.  Career  In 1929, the Lozza brothers moved to Buenos Aires to get further funding to study painting in Italy; however, the 1930 Argentine coup d'√©tat made this impossible. During this time they studied theatre with Jos√© Gonz√°lez Castillo and in December 1930 put on the play La sombra de la nada at the Teatro Roma de Alberti in collaboration with poet Vicente Barbieri and Juan Ferreyra Basso. In 1932, after exhibiting paintings in a library in Almafuerte, in Flores and Alberti, as well as other venues, Lozza published an article called \\"A prop√≥sito del centenario de Goethe\\" in a periodical called La Zona. He also published poems and a play called Crep√∫sculos. In 1933, Lozza, a member of the Communist Party at that time, was jailed for a month after protests of the treatment of political prisoners. During this period he became friends with Lino Enea Spilimbergo, Miguel Carlos Victorica, and the Gonz√°lez Tu√±√≥n brothers: Ra√∫l Gonz√°lez Tu√±√≥n and Enrique Gonz√°lez Tu√±√≥n. Lozza continued to be politically active, publishing illustrations and writings in the anti-fascist journal Socorro Rojo and La Rep√∫blica. In 1937, Lozza contracted tuberculosis, but continued to work. At this time, he works as a painter, title broker, lingerie cutter, fabric stamper, and artist in the field of advertising. Lozza eventually starts a lingerie business called Lingerie Femenil. As part of that business he designed lingerie for many famous women, including Delia Garc√©s.  Personal life  In 1938, Lozza married his first wife, with whom he had a son, Arturo Lozza. After they divorced, in 1947 Lozza began a relationship with the painter Antonia Beliz√°n, who he later married and had a son, Carlos Ra√∫l Lozza.  Death  On January 27, 2008, Lozza died of natural causes, at the age of 96, in the La Paternal, neighborhood of Buenos Aires in Argentina. He is buried at Cementerio de la Chacarita.

It was built in 1801 to design by city architect J√∏rgen Henrich Rawert and was listed on the Danish Registry of Protected Buildings and Places in 1918. Bruun & Stengade, a fashion brand, is based on the third floor. History J√∏rgen Henrich Rawert Sankt Ann√¶ Plads 11 was built in 1811 by city builder J√∏rgen Henrich Rawert for his own use. photo had already built the property at Sankt Ann√¶ Plads 5 a few years earlier and had lived there until 1797 when he moved to an apartment at Borgergade 25. Rewert does not seem to have moved to No. 11 after it was completed but instead moved to Amaliegade 3 in 1702. Then in 1805, he seems to have briefly lived in the building at No. 11 before moving back to Borgergade 25. No. 11 on an old photo The merchant and shipowner Erich Erichsen lived in the building from 1811 and until his death in 1837. He had completed the more extravagant Erichsen Mansion on Kongens Nytorv in 1801 but had to moved after he went bankrupt during the economic crisis that followed the war with England. Count Carl von Moltke took over the property but moved to No. 15 in 1844. Architecture The building consists of three storeys over a high cellar and is eight bays wide. The six central bays are flanked by pilasters on the two upper floors. Decorative elements include triangular pediments over the 2nd and 7th window of the first floor and balustrades under the four central windows of the second floor. The two slightly recessed, outer bays are wider than the other and the one at the western end of the building has an arched gateway while the first floor window at the eastern end of the building is placed in am arched niche to promote an impression of symmetry. The six-bay dormer in the roof is a later addition. The complex also comprises a side wing that projects from the rear side of the building and a rear wing. The entire complex was listed on the Danish Registry of Protected Buildings and Places in 1918. The design of the facade closely resembles that of Rewert's building at No. 5, except that it is one bay wider and only has one gateway. Today Caf√© No. 11 is located in the high cellar while the rest of the building is offices. Bruun & Stengade, a fashion company, is based on the third floor.

She is a recipient of the Pablo Neruda Award and the Poetry Altazor Award of the National Arts. Biography Rosabetty Mu√±oz grew up in Ancud, and took her first steps as a poet in the Chaicura Group, directed by . She is a professor of Spanish at the Austral University of Chile. She published her first book of poems, Canto de una oveja del reba√±o, in 1981 as a university student in Valdivia. She also wrote most of her second book in that city, En lugar de morir, which was released in 1987. Her third book, Hijos (1991), was written, as she says, \\"after a black period [...], in which I thought the well of my poetry had run dry.\\" According to Iv√°n Carrasco's description of ethnocultural discourse in Chilean poetry, whose authors include Rosabetty Mu√±oz, in her poetic production there is a sustained appreciation of the presence of syncretism between Catholicism and indigenous beliefs, observing a high intercultural and interethnic content (ethnocultural poetry). Furthermore, while some authors classify her within a group of writers assigned to the poetry of Southern Chile, Carrasco ‚Äì referring to Hijos (1991) and Baile de se√±oritas (1994) ‚Äì frames her work within the modern poetry of Chilo√©, whose representatives use \\"a Spanish-Chilliche-Chono intercultural lexicon and a high degree of awareness of poetic movements.\\" On her poetry ‚Äì \\"which is characterized by reflecting southern Chile, dealing with gender issues and human relations and making poetry 'a space of resistance'\\" ‚Äì has said: \\"In her verses, and closely following Vallejo, she expresses the vastness and depth of human pain, but lived and seen from the ontological condition of woman constituted in the cultural space of Chilo√© previous or parallel to capitalist modernity\\", and \\"Her language, in simple appearance, almost minimalist, is actually very complex because of the metaphysical dimension it contains, that makes her poetry a kind of prayer or song that always moves toward recollection.\\" Rosabetty Mu√±oz has received several awards, among which are the 2000 Pablo Neruda Award for her work as a whole, and the Award for Sombras en El Rosselot (2002) as the best unpublished work. In addition, she was nominated in the literary arts category, poetry mention of the 2009 Altazor Award for National Arts for En Nombre de Ninguna, referred to as a \\"remarkable contribution to world literature (...) [and] a deep and painful poetic entry in one of the many torn sides of the body of Chile,\\" while in the 2012 edition, she won the award for Polvo de huesos. She is married to the teacher and director of the Polivalente de Quemchi high school, Juan Galleguillos, with whom she has a daughter and two sons.

However, it is also about resentment and the search of showing displeasure. All of this is evidenced in the poem \\"Grito de una oveja descarriada\\": All these signs of revolution are strongly tackled in poems such as \\"Hay ovejas y ovejas\\", \\"Reintegraci√≥n al reba√±o\\", \\"Oveja que defiende su posici√≥n en el reba√±o\\" and \\"Grito de una oveja descarriada\\". = En lugar de morir, editorial Cambio, 1987 = This work is about the time and fate concepts, the great ego owned by those who arrived to the Chiloe Archipielago with the confidence that nothing is stronger than them It expresses the desire of lead the own path and choose their outcome, when there is no fate that can either be known or handle. Time and events can not be predicted or even be chosen: they will break down their ambitions by themselves. = Hijos, El Kultr√∫n, Valdivia, 1991 = This poems book, composed by poems which show an evident toponymy of Chiloe, such as ‚ÄùChacao‚Äù, ‚ÄúLlingua‚Äù, ‚ÄúCaguach‚Äù, ‚ÄúLemuy‚Äù, ‚Äúisla Coldita‚Äù, ‚ÄúMetalqui‚Äù, among others, recall the issue of the marginalized motherhood, set in the Chiloe Archipielago, describing elements of its culture and showing, as in the previous works, characteristics of social criticism based on a context of forced miscegenation between foreigners and native women: = Baile de se√±oritas, El Kultr√∫n, Valdivia, 1994 = This poems-compiling work is about the pillaging ‚Äîin the full sense of the world: material, cultural and spiritual‚Äî suffered in the isle from the invaders arriving. Because: = La santa, historia de una su elevaci√≥n, LOM, Santiago, 1998 = This collection of poems, with titles such as ‚ÄúElla carga reci√©n nacidos‚Äù, ‚ÄúLa culpa‚Äù, ‚ÄúArden las velas de la devoci√≥n‚Äù and ‚ÄúMi √∫tero rememora‚Äù, includes many religious aspects that are expressed in the suffering of the woman: the saint, and that virtuous (and stereotyped) intrinsic holiness which she is searching to get rid of: = Sombras en El Rosselot, LOM, Santiago, 2002 = Work inspired by the bohemian life in the south of Chile, specifically in a brothel: El Rosselot. Within its poems such as ‚ÄúCasa de citas‚Äù, ‚ÄúFestivas‚Äù, ‚ÄúEspectros‚Äù, ‚ÄúHuellas‚Äù and ‚ÄúR√≠o nocturno‚Äù, it can be inferred the desolate spectral presence of the women who used to work in those places in verses such: = Ratada, LOM, Santiago, 2005 = Poems in this book are focus on a situation within the author's background; an invading infestation of rats in the south of Chile. In always-inside-parentheses poems such as ‚Äú(En esas playas)‚Äù, ‚Äú(Al olor de la desgracia)‚Äù, ‚Äú(Se encabrita el miedo)‚Äù, ‚Äú(El diente filoso de la rata)‚Äù and ‚Äú(Tan enorme plaga)‚Äù, it can be observed a putrid environment, and from the author's view, for being there ‚Äúit is necessary being defeated‚Äù. Some people say this work is a metaphor of the Chilean society during the military dictatorship, whereas another describe the rats, in an allegoric way, as ‚Äúthe invasion of the modernity that is set up in the town.‚Äù = En nombre de ninguna, El Kultr√∫n, Valdivia, 2008 = With titles as ‚ÄúBoca de r√≠o‚Äù, ‚ÄúVuelo y ca√≠da‚Äù, ‚ÄúLa sombra de la hija‚Äù, ‚ÄúApartar los zumbidos‚Äù, ‚ÄúSiempreviva‚Äù, ‚ÄúMisterios gozoso and ‚ÄúEn nombre de ninguna‚Äù, this work of Rosabetty Mu√±oz is, probably, one of her most recognized poetry books. It captures testimonies of women who miscarry and writes about incest and girls who were sexually abused with a direct style that does not require further interpretation. Motherhood and destroyed childhood are the main theme. = Polvo de huesos, anthology edited by Kurt Folch; Ediciones T√°citas, Santiago, 2012 = This is the first poetry anthology (so far) belonging to the author, whose selection and prologue were written by Kurt Folch. These collected work, winner of the Poetry Altazor Award of the National Arts in 2013 and composed of ten poem books ‚Äîtwo unpublished yet‚Äî and an unpublished work written in prose, has as main characteristic the approach to the Chilo√©'s community, city where Rosabetty was born, grew up and, currently, is living. The author addresses issues such as rebelliousness and hopelessness, the abuse of authority by a few \\"invaders\\", and even those more controversial issues that have a greater impact on the society such as abortion, sexual abuse and incest.

She spent a majority of her time working for the National Organization of Afro-American Women. She was a prominent socialite in Washington, D.C. throughout most of her life where she lived with her husband, United States Senator Blanche Bruce. In addition to these accomplishments, she was the first black teacher in the public school system in Cleveland, and she eventually became a highly regarded educator at Tuskegee University in Alabama.  Early life  Josephine Beall Willson was born in Philadelphia on October 29, 1853 to Dr. Joseph Willson and Elizabeth Harnett Willson, the first of five children for the pair. Her family spent no more than a year in Philadelphia, moving to Cleveland in 1854. The family prioritized education and sent Josephine to Cleveland Central High School, where she graduated in 1871. After graduation, she took several teaching courses which then gave her the opportunity to teach at the Mayflower school, making her the first black teacher in the public school system of Cleveland.  Personal life  In 1878 she married Blanche Bruce and traveled throughout Europe gaining culture and experience together. Upon their return to the United States, they settled in Washington, D.C. in order for her husband to pursue a career in politics, while she became an activist. Bruce had her only child, Roscoe Conkling Bruce, in 1879. He was named after the Republican senator Roscoe Conkling, who had helped Josephine's husband face discrimination while being sworn into Congress. She delayed the christening of her son until he could be taken to Cleveland, so that the same rector who had performed her marriage could christen her child. Bruce dedicated her life to the National Organization of Afro-American Women (NACW), successfully running for the vice presidency of the organization in 1896. In 1898 her husband, Blanche K. Bruce passed away, leaving her a widow. After her husband's death, she competently managed the money and land of her late husband. She was given the opportunity by Booker T. Washington to become the principal at his Tuskegee University from 1899- 1902, where she continued to promote education. This opportunity gave her the ability to offer training to other school teachers as the institute itself was vocational. The pupils of the Tuskegee Institute were not from aristocratic families, as opposed to students she had worked with in the past. Her move to the rural South was also a hard transition for someone use to a cosmopolitan lifestyle. Bruce was occasionally criticized for accepting the role as Lady Principal. Oftentimes she was seen as a wealthy woman taking a job from a less fortunate young woman who would be more able to connect with the students of the school. Bruce's scholarship inspired her son, Roscoe Bruce, to graduate from Harvard University in 1902, eventually allowing him to become the head of the academic department at Tuskegee University. Bruce then moved to Mississippi for a short time to live with her family, only to return to Washington, D.C. to run for the presidency of the NACW in 1906. Due to a heart attack, Bruce died in her sleep on February 15, 1923, in Kimball, West Virginia.  Social Life  Blanche Bruce, Josephine's husband Bruce was an accomplished hostess and socialite, especially during her husband's years serving in the Senate. The African-American produced newspaper Washington Bee noted that Bruce \\"pays and receives calls from those of her select set with unvarying regard for etiquette\\". She was noted to be fashionable and a great beauty. Newspapers placed great emphasis on her complexion, remarking that she didn't have any evidence of African heritage and that her skin was so fair that she could pass for a Spanish lady. In one account, she was described as having blonde hair and blue eyes. Bruce and her husband were often criticized by members of the black community, who claimed the Bruces spent more time with whites than blacks. Whites also snubbed Bruce and her husband, excluding them from social events that weren't officially related to Blanche Bruce's position in the Senate. Democrats and their wives would refuse to visit Bruce, looking down on her because of her racial heritage. After her husband's senatorial career ended, Bruce's social rejection by whites became more frequent.  Activism  Because of previously existing splits between white suffrage groups and African American suffrage groups during the 19th century, Josephine Bruce was not allowed to participate in those white suffrage groups due to the racial divide. Due to this, some African American women attempted to join white women organizations in hopes that through combined efforts, they would be able to achieve results faster for both groups. The ultimate objectives of the groups Bruce participated in was the racial advancement of women through uplifting ideas of service. However, these organizations denied permission for African American women like Josephine Bruce to attend their conventions or participate in their activities. In response to this frequent rejection from white organizations that African American women were influenced to form their separate national organization that disregarded race, giving Josephine the chance to be in various leadership roles. Bruce began her career as a teacher at Mayflower School in Cleveland, making her the first black teacher in the city's public school system. Her positions at Mayflower School and at Tuskegee University allowed her to share her ideas and shape the minds of the youth around her. Outside of teaching, she dedicated her life to the National Organization of Afro-American Women (NACW), successfully running for the vice presidency of the organization in 1896. Despite having early successes with the organization she lost the election, which was attributed to her fair skin complexion. She also helped inspire the career of Mary Church Terrell by inviting the younger woman to stay with her in Washington. Tuskegee University, where Josephine Bruce served as \\"Lady Principal\\" She also worked alongside black female teachers to strengthen the newly created National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), focusing on how black women could promote social uplift. Bruce was also involved with the World Purity Federation and Women's Christian Temperance Union. In addition to her activism, she traveled extensively with her husband when he lectured on a circuit as a Congressman. She became the editor of National Notes, which was owned by the NACW. In these various writings, she discussed the impact and need for better education for colored women. Despite her heavy involvement within the NACW, Bruce became a focal point of controversy. Members of the NACW began to accuse Mary Church Terrell, Bruce's friend and current president of the NACW, of handpicking Bruce to be her successor. This event was the beginning of Bruce's gradual decrease in involvement with the NACW. Bruce was also a strong proponent for suffrage, aligning her goals with those of the NACW. She continued to live in Washington, D.C. in the following years as a socialite, and eventually moved to West Virginia until her death. She was respected by many, but often failed to be accepted by black women as well as white women, as her light skin left her an outsider of both groups.  Effects of Class  Josephine Bruce and her husband were part of an newly-emerging elite African American class. In the late 18th century, the African American aristocrats of Washington, D.C. had started to detach themselves from the lower African American classes, categorizing themselves as an elite upper class. These aristocrats ‚Äúdefended the thesis that the social equality of all Negroes was a concept destructive to racial progress‚Äù. Professional men such as scholars and office holders, despite obstacles, became more similar to the white community. Many Africans Americans thought the Bruces were ‚Äúnot good enough for whites and too good for their own race‚Äù Many white people in 1883 thought that wealth, learning, and official place did not give African American families, like the Bruces, the right to enter white society. As a result, the Bruces were not completely accepted by whites or African Americans.  Writings and Speeches  Josephine's speech featured in the Philadelphia Times Bruce wrote several articles and speeches during her career, talking about education and activism. Some of her work includes two pieces written for The Voice of the Negro, one written for The Crisis, and a speech transcribed in the Philadelphia Times. The Congress a Great Success In 1879, following the merging of the National Congress of Colored Women with the National Association of Colored Women, Bruce gave a speech commemorating the union. She advocated for women's suffrage and celebrated the common cause that united African American women together. She also acknowledged black women's unique position to advocate for women's rights. Bruce declares suffrage as a worthy cause, one that helps women rise up from oppression and helps elevate African Americans as a whole. She also argues that suffrage helps African American women dispel negative stereotypes about African Americans. What Has Education Done for Colored Women First page of \\"What Has Education Done for Colored Women\\" Published in the African-American literary journal The Voice of the Negro in 1904, Bruce argues that educating African-American women results in the social uplift of their families and communities. Bruce notes that education enables African American women to become more prominent in their community, allowing them to give back and promote social uplift. Women, in Bruce's view, by working as teachers, church leaders, and temperance advocates, can help better their community. To establish her point, Bruce presents examples of different \\"Negro\\" populations, noting each of their characteristics. Detailing the lives of African Americans in different towns in Virginia, Louisiana, and Ohio, Bruce argues that gaining an education leads to a higher quality of life. Bruce also attributes the \\"pathetic conditions\\" of the African-American members of Calumet, Louisiana to their lack of education. On the other hand, she links the creation of the upper class in Xenia, Ohio with the residents' higher education levels. The educated class, in her view, are people who have \\"exemplary lives\\" and were able to uplift their communities because of the positive qualities they gained during their formal educations. The Afterglow of the Women's Convention First page of \\"Afterglow of Women's Convention\\" In November 1904, Josephine wrote for The Voice of the Negro about the results of the NACW's convention. She tells a story about encountered a young boy after a meeting with the NACW, who then awakened her to the worthy achievement that the women's organization was making for small children like him. In this article she states that the future lies \\"at the foundation of the organization of women‚Äù. She claims that it is evident that the NACW is making a substantial growth, musing about how their purpose has been to give ‚Äúproper direction and purpose to the lives of the younger generation‚Äù. She also continues to summarize the conventions by explaining that women are working hard to do local work as well as general work in matters that still need to be worked on. Josephine Bruce emphasized that the NACW's organizational purposes are enlarging and expansive, resulting in lasting changes. She notes that ‚Äú36 states and one territory now have membership in the national organization‚Äù, even the \\"Mormon state\\", Utah. Bruce concludes that although the NACW is a long way from achieving their goals, there has been a record of great achievement marking their ‚Äúnew milestone in the progress of colored women‚Äù, bringing them closer to gaining nationally recognized equal rights. Colored Women's Clubs This article was published on August 1915 in The Crisis, the official magazine of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Mrs. B. K. Bruce, which was Josephine's married name, writes about how the national club movement among colored women started when Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin called for a meeting among suffragette women. Through consecutive conventions in the following years, the two national women's organizations that were merged to form the National Association of Colored Women were called the National Federation of Colored Women and the National League of Colored Women. Mrs. Bruce also writes how in the following year they would hold their tenth biennial session. She emphasizes the organization's success, saying that it was a ‚Äúsocial service not alone for colored people but for humanity‚Äù. She notes that during these conventions over four hundred delegates represented women throughout the country, coming from ‚Äúfrom the East the West, the North and the South‚Äù. Josephine ends by explaining that around one thousand clubs are part of the NACW and that the money raised was used for establishing places like orphan homes and social settlements.

Waxman has built on the \\"molecular revolution\\" to study, at a fundamental level, how neurons and glial cells work within the normal nervous system, and why they do not work properly in various diseased states. His laboratory studies isolated nerve cells in culture, and rodents with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a model of multiple sclerosis. These studies have, for example, provided a basis for a clinical trial of the efficacy of phenytoin, a sodium channel blocker in patients with optic neuritis. Waxman's studies have combined molecular genetics, molecular biology, and biophysics to show how specific ion channels relate to human pain. He has been a member of an international coalition that showed that sodium channel mutations can cause of peripheral neuropathy. He has used atomic-level modeling to study pharmacogenomics, at first in laboratory studies, and then in early studies on genomically guided approaches to the treatment of pain. A novel class of medications that target sodium channels in the peripheral nervous system, and that do not have potential for addiction, is based in part on his work and is currently being assessed in early-stage clinical trials.

Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is an electron microscopy (EM) technique applied on samples cooled to cryogenic temperatures and embedded in an environment of vitreous water. An aqueous sample solution is applied to a grid-mesh and plunge-frozen in liquid ethane or a mixture of liquid ethane and propane. While development of the technique began in the 1970s, recent advances in detector technology and software algorithms have allowed for the determination of biomolecular structures at near-atomic resolution. This has attracted wide attention to the approach as an alternative to X-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy for macromolecular structure determination without the need for crystallization. In 2017, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Jacques Dubochet, Joachim Frank, and Richard Henderson \\"for developing cryo-electron microscopy for the high-resolution structure determination of biomolecules in solution.\\" Nature Methods also named cryo-EM as the \\"Method of the Year\\" in 2016. Transmission electron cryomicroscopy Cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo- TEM) is a transmission electron microscopy technique that is used in structural biology and materials science. *Cryogenic electron tomography (Cryo-ET), a specialized application of where samples are imaged as they are tilted *Electron crystallography, method to determine the arrangement of atoms in solids using a TEM *MicroED, method to determine the structure of proteins, peptides, organic molecules, and inorganic compounds using electron diffraction from 3D crystals *Single particle analysis cryo-EM, an averaging method to determine protein structure from monodisperse samples  History = Early development = In the 1960s, the use of Transmission Electron Microscopy for structure determination methods was limited because of the radiation damage due to high energy electron beams. Scientists hypothesized that examining specimens at low temperatures would reduce beam-induced radiation damage. Both liquid helium (‚àí269 ¬∞C or 4 K or ‚àí452.2 ¬∞F) and liquid nitrogen (‚àí195.79 ¬∞C or 77 K or ‚àí320 ¬∞F) were considered as cryogens. In 1980, Erwin Knapek and Jacques Dubochet published commenting on beam damage at cryogenic temperatures sharing observations that: > Thin crystals mounted on carbon film were found to be from 30 to 300 times > more beam-resistant at 4 K than at room temperature... Most of our results > can be explained by assuming that cryoprotection in the region of 4 K is > strongly dependent on the temperature. However, these results were not reproducible and amendments were published in Nature just two years later informing that the beam resistance was less significant than initially anticipated. The protection gained at 4 K was closer to \\"tenfold for standard samples of L-valine,\\" than what was previously stated. In 1981, Alasdair McDowall and Jacques Dubochet, scientists at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory, reported the first successful implementation of cryo-EM. McDowall and Dubochet vitrified pure water in a thin film by spraying it onto a hydrophilic carbon film that was rapidly plunged into cryogen (liquid propane or liquid ethane cooled to 100 K). The thin layer of amorphous ice was less than 1 ¬µm thick and an electron diffraction pattern confirmed the presence of amorphous/vitreous ice. In 1984, Dubochet's group demonstrated the power of cryo-EM in structural biology with analysis of vitrified adenovirus type 2, T4 bacteriophage, Semliki Forest virus, Bacteriophage CbK, and Vesicular-Stomatitis-Virus. = 2017 Nobel Prize in Chemistry = In 2017, three scientists, Jacques Dubochet, Joachim Frank and Richard Henderson, were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for developing a technique that would image biomolecules.

Following this engagement she was their soloist on different occasions. Biography Lulu Kunkel Burg was born in Cincinnati on December 3, 1876, to William Kunkel and Lena Frederick. Her grandparents had moved to St. Louis when she was about seven. Her uncle, Oscar Frederick, who was a violinist noticed her talent for music helped her to develop her talents. She came to live with her grandparents a year later and they bought her a violin, so she could make herself independent. She became a student of Otto Knaeble who led the Grand Opera House orchestra, from the time she was eight until she was seventeen. Her first public appearance was before the Y. M. C. A. in 1885; after that she played before different lodges and churches. For some of these she received five dollars. While Ovide Musin was in St. Louis on a concert tour, she was sent to play before him to get an opinion as to whether she ought to have further advantages. He advised that after some time she would be benefited by a course in one of the European conservatories. When the time came, her uncle could not afford to do this, so some of the musicians Robyn, Kroeger, Epstein and G. A. Buder ‚Äî arranged for a testimonial concert which netted her about $600. This paid the expenses of the journey, and she entered the conservatory in Brussels. Lulu Kunkel Burg was a pupil of Eug√®ne Ysa√øe, for four years, in the Conservatoire Royal de Musique, Brussels, Belgium. She was one of the winners of the first prize among forty students. When she returned to America she became a pupil of Max Bendix for six months, who was engaged by the World's Fair officials. A recital at Memorial Hall was her first venture in concert work after her European study. This was immediately followed by an engagement as first violinist with the St. Louis Symphony Society, where she remained six years. When Max Zach was made director he had adverse opinions about women being engaged with such a great number of men and declared himself very frankly, which ended the engagement. As a soloist she appeared before every club of importance in St. Louis, beginning her public appearance at the age of eight years, and also gave concerts and assisted in those given by the Symphony Society, Morning Choral, Liederkranz, Rubinstein and Friday Clubs, and musicales in private homes, which was one of her special lines of work. With ease she executed the most intricate and dangerous technical flights. Her originality in interpretation was distinctive. To the listener her violin spoke with an intense sympathy and awokened a thrill of the senses as only such an instrument skillfully handled could arouse. Her playing made the violin respond to every emotion of her temperament in tones of the finest shading. Lulu Kunkel Burg was a teacher of violin for twelve years at Forest Park University, and for the same time violinist of the First Presbyterian Church. She also taught in the Missouri Conservatory for five years. Burg was very successful as a teacher at the Forest Park University, of which Anna Sneed Cairns was the president. At the First Presbyterian Church she played every Sunday morning and evening. With her in this work, outside of the regular choir, was Wilhelmina Lowe-Speyer, who was for many years the harpist for the St. Louis Symphony Society, and later played in the orchestra of which her husband was the leader at the Columbia Theatre. Just before Burg's marriage she was offered a position in New York on the vaudeville stage by H. M. Blossom, Jr., the author of Yankee Consul, Checkers and other plays. It was a great temptation, but she rejected the offer and married Frederick Henry Burg (1870-1937) in February, 1902. Frederick Burg and Philip Burg were in the grocery business on South Broadway, St. Louis. They had one daughter, Virginia B. Klaus (b. 1908). Burg included in her repertoire selections from Wagner, Wieniawski, Saint-Saens, Bruch, Lalo, Mendelssohn and other great composers. She died on September 11, 1953, and is buried at Bellefontaine Cemetery, St. Louis.

Early life, education and girls' club organising  Jephcott was born on 1 May 1900 in Alcester, Warwickshire, the youngest child of an auctioneer, Edward Arthur Jephcott, and his wife, Agnes Amelia n√©e Boobbyer. After attending Alcester Grammar School, she studied at the University of Wales, Aberystwyth, graduating in 1922 with a Bachelor of Arts degree (BA) in history. She worked in teaching, as a secretary, and for Dr Barnardo's homes, before becoming involved in the girls' club movement. She joined the Birmingham Union of Girls' Clubs and became its organising secretary in 1927 and eight years later became the temporary County Organiser for the National Association of Girls' Clubs. During the Second World War, she became a National Organiser and moved to London.\\"Jephcott, (Agnes) Pearl\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (online edition, Oxford University Press, 2004). Retrieved 30 January 2018.  Social research and later years  In 1942, Jephcott was given leave by the National Association of Girls' Clubs to carry out research into girls' experiences of growing up in England and Wales. She collected information on the work and home life, leisure and relationships of 153 girls aged 14 to 18, the results of which were reported in Jephcott's first book: Girls Growing Up (1942). She followed this up the next year with Clubs for Girls, which provided a guide on organising clubs. She was awarded a Barnett Fellowship to carry out a follow-up study of the girls she spoke to in 1942, and produced Rising Twenties in 1948 as a result. She then worked for Political and Economic Planning, before joining the University of Nottingham in 1950 to oversee research projects, one of which examined youth groups and was published as Some Young People (1954). That year she became a Senior Research Assistant at the London School of Economics, working under Richard Titmuss alongside Nancy Seear and John Smith. They investigated married women in employment in Bermondsey and she focused on home life. The result was Married Women Working, published in 1962. In the view of Helen McCarthy, this study meant that Jephcott was one of a number of researchers in the 1950s and early 1960s (such as Seear, Viola Klein, Ferdynand Zweig, Judith Hubback and Hannah Gavron) who \\"helped to entrench new understandings of married women‚Äôs employment as a fundamental feature of advanced industrial societies, and one that solved the dilemmas of 'modern' woman across social classes.\\"Helen McCarthy, \\"Social Science and Married Women‚Äôs Employment in Post-War Britain\\", Past and Present, vol. 233, no. 1 (2016), p. 270. Jephcott was also a member of the Central Advisory Council for Education in England for the year 1957‚Äì58 and sat on the Albermarle Committee in 1958. She left the LSE and studied families in Notting Hill, London, leading to a report, A Troubled Area in 1964, which highlighted the scarcity of resources for disadvantaged people in an area which also witnessed substantial immigration from Commonwealth countries. She studied young people's leisure interests while working for Glasgow University and produced Time of One's Own in 1967 and then Homes in High Flats four years later, which analysed the experiences of residents in Glasgow's high-rise social housing. She left the University in 1970 and travelled abroad to carry out UNICEF research; from 1973‚Äì75 she carried out research into high-rise flats in Birmingham. She died unmarried on 9 November 1980.

Biography Rubloff was born to a Jewish family on June 25, 1902 in Duluth, Minnesota, the eldest of five children born to Solomon Rubloff, an immigrant from Russia who owned several jewelry and dry goods stores. The family moved to Chisholm, Minnesota but lost everything to a fire in 1908 which destroyed the town. In 1914, at the age of 12, Rubloff ran away to Duluth, Minnesota where he worked as galley boy on the J.S. Stevenson, an ore boat. In 1915, he moved to Cincinnati where he worked at a furniture manufacturer. In 1917, he moved to Chicago where his parents had moved and worked for his father's ladies clothing manufacturing company. His parent's factory burned down and his father enlisted his son to lease some real estate he had accumulated and was serendipitously offered a job by the lessee who liked his gumption. In 1919, he went to work for the Robert White & Co selling downtown office space in Chicago. In 1930, he went into business for himself with only $700, having squandered all the money he made. He named the company the Arthur Rubloff & Co. His break came when he negotiated a complicated and large North Kansas City development project for investment-banking firm, Allen & Co. Using the proceeds from that transaction and leveraging his relationship with Allen and Co, he developed ‚Äì in the late 1940s ‚Äì Evergreen Plaza, one of the first shopping malls. He promoted, developed, and transformed North Michigan Avenue into the \\"Magnificent Mile\\". He helped to developed the Old Town neighborhood in Chicago, and the Southland and Sun Valley projects in San Francisco as well as co-developing Carl Sandburg Village, the Ft.

He was one of the eminent visual artists of his time and became especially well known for his lithographic works. P. C. de Moor (left) Simon Moulijn (with palette) D. Wiggers (standing) at the Rotterdam Academy (¬±1884?)  Biography  Simon Moulijn was born in Rotterdam as a son of the manufacter and merchant Simon Moulijn senior and his second wife Magdalena Maria Johanna Walter. Despite initial doubts of his parents Simon Moulijn started 1882 an education at the Rotterdam Academy of Arts (Rotterdamsche Academie voor Beeldende Kunsten en Technische Wetenschappen, today ‚ÄúWillem de Koning Academy Rotterdam University of applied sciences‚Äù). From 1885 onward he continued his studies at the Rijksakademie voor beeldende kunsten (State Academy of fine arts). In this period he met other artists as Ferdinand Hart Nibbrig, Richard Roland Holst and Isaac Isra√´ls. After the end of his formal education in the year 1887 a period of artistic search and wandering around followed. He lived and worked in various places in the province Drenthe, in Rotterdam, in The Hague, in De Steeg near Arnhem, where he shared a studio with the painter Edzard Koning and in Renkum. He married 12 March 1902 the poet Hester Henri√´tte Jacoba Haitsma-Mulier. The couple settled in Laren (North Holland). At that time many artists and fellow students from the Academy in Amsterdam already lived there. His house ‚Äúd‚ÄôEglantier‚Äù was built after Moulijn's own design in 1903. Two sons were born in the years 1904 and 1908. In the year 1917 Moulijn was appointed as a teacher at the Rotterdamsche Academie voor Beeldende Kunsten en Technische Wetenschappen (Rotterdam Academy) and the family moved to The Hague.\\"Biography in Simon Moulijn 1866-1948\\", p.115 After his retirement as a teacher (1932) Moulijn lived and worked from 1935 until 1944 in Wassenaar. In 1946 he and his wife moved in with their eldest son in The Hague. Moulijn died 2 November 1948. His wife died a month later (1 December 1948). Both are buried at the graveyard of the village church in Wassenaar.  Works  During the period of his artistic search Simon Moulijn followed the examples set by the modern French painters as well as Jan Toorop and Vincent van Gogh. The Symbolism of the Belgian philosopher Maurice Maeterlinck also strongly influenced his work. Moulijn himself writes about this period in the year 1913: ‚Äúhis mysticism led me to distort nature in a barbaric way‚Äù Letter written by Simon Moulijn to the critic G. H. Marius (Gemeentearchief Den Haag: Municipal archives The Hague) as quoted in ‚ÄúSimon Moulijn 1866-1948‚Äù, p146 Lithograph by S. Moulijn (1920) self-portrait Although in later work Symbolism often shows through, Moulijn developed around 1893-1894 an own artistic style and figurative language. His first big success was the one man exposition in the H√¥tel de l‚ÄôArt Nouveau of S. Bing in Paris during summer 1896.Heij, p113 Always in search for new inspiration Moulijn travelled much. He worked amongst other places in the Dutch provinces Drenthe, North Brabant, Gelderland (Guelders), Zeeland and in the southern part of Limburg. His journeys also led him abroad and he worked in Germany (among other places in Monschau and Holzhausen 1905, Todtnau 1922), in Switzerland (Kandersteg 1926), In Italy (among other places Tivoli (Villa d‚ÄôEste) and Frascati 1911, Florence 1938), in Luxemburg (Beaufort 1913), in France (among other places Fontainebleau 1930, Versailles 1930 and 1934, Neuilly 1931, various places along the river Oise (among other at Royaumont Abbey) 1939 and in the Alpes Maritimes 1938).\\"Biography in Simon Moulijn 1866-1948\\", p. 114-116 The result of these journeys was a large number of paintings, drawings and lithographs. Moulijn's fascination for nature and the various forms and atmospheres of landscape is one of the main themes of his work. Apart from his first paintings in academic style his independent development began with the simplifying nearly abstract sceneries influenced by symbolism and a certain mysticism. But over the years he finds more and more towards ‚Äúa Dutch realism‚Äù.D. V. Nijland Simon Moulijn, Lithograaf en schilder, p 18-20, Monograph in the series ‚ÄúBeeldende kunstenaars\\", Publisher Ad Donker, Rotterdam 1946 His development as an artist shows his love for nature but also his personal need to keep nature in a way under control.Nijland, p. 26-27 Therefore, many of his paintings and lithographs show woods from a certain distance or even behind a wall. He also loved parks with their controlled nature. His way of reproducing various landscapes also shows one of his main characteristics as ‚ÄúPainter of the romantic loneliness‚Äù.From an article in the Algemeen Handelsblad as quoted in Jan Jaap Heij: ‚ÄúSimon Moulijn als schilder en tekenaar‚Äù (Simon Moulijn as painter and draughtsman) in Simon Moulijn 1866-1948 About the end of the 1920s Moulijn started again to paint and draw more regularly portraits. In the year 1893 Moulijn made his first lithographs. Over the years the occupation of Moulijn with drawing on stone grew more intensive and lithography was more and more in the centre of attention in his work. The main part in his stone drawings is played by peaceful rivers, woods, parks, but also fortresses and lively, urban landscapes of the harbour of his native town Rotterdam. In total the complete works comprise 189 lithographs. Moulijn's use of lithography also influenced his way of painting and the execution of works in these fully different techniques gave him a special position in the Dutch art scene of the first half of the twentieth century. Moulijn also created drafts for book covers, drawings, etchings, wood engravings and commercial art. He illustrated several books of fairytales by the author Marie Marx-Koning. Apart from a large number of articles in several journals and art catalogues Moulijn has written two books: ‚ÄúDe lithografische Prentkunst‚Äù (‚ÄúThe lithographic picture art‚Äù, De Wereldbibliotheek, Amsterdam 1918) and ‚ÄúDe eerste jaren van de lithographische prentkunst in Nederland‚Äù (‚ÄúThe first years of the lithographic picture art in the Netherlands‚Äù, Martinus Nijhoff, The Hague, 1927). He founded 1910 together with his friend the painter F. Hart Nibbrig in Laren a painting school.\\"Biography in Simon Moulijn 1866-1948\\", p114 In 1911 he was co-founder of the ‚ÄúVereeniging tot Bevordering der Grafische Kunst‚Äù (Association for the promotion of de graphic art) and became secretary of the association. As one of the important Dutch artists of his time he often participated in the organisation of exhibitions of Dutch art and especially graphic art in the Netherlands and abroad. Among others he was co-organisator of the graphic exhibition in Leipzig (Germany) in 1914 and an important exhibition of Dutch fine arts in Brighton 1920. It was in Brighton where he met the British lithographer John Copley and made friends with him. In 1934 Moulijn earned special merits for his part in the organisation of an Exhibition of Dutch fine arts in Budapest.  Public collections  Among the public collections holding works of Simon Moulijn are: * Drents museum in Assen * Rijksprentenkabinet (part of the Rijksmuseum) in Amsterdam * Gemeentemuseum Den Haag in The Hague * Museum Boymans van Beuningen in Rotterdam * Kr√∂ller-M√ºller-Museum near Otterlo * Centraal Museum in Utrecht * Dordrechts Museum in Dordrecht * British Museum in London * Biblioth√®que Nationale in Paris * Albertina in Vienna  Honors  * 1915 Panama-Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco: Bronze medal * 1923 Exhibition of Dutch artists in the field of fine arts in Amsterdam: Silver medal * 1928 Member of the Jury of the Olympic games in Amsterdam: Silver medal * 1934 Budapest: Silver plaque * 1934 Ungarian officer cross of merit * 1938 Knight grand cross in the Order of Oranje-Nassau.

It was inaugurated in 1992. Origins The museum is housed in the former Cascais Sporting Club. This was founded in 1879 by the then Prince Carlos of Portugal to promote sports and host social events. Built on the former parade ground of the nearby Citadel of Cascais, the members, who came from the nobility, came to be known as ‚Äúof the Parade‚Äù, compared with those who were ‚Äúnot of the Parade‚Äù. For a time the club was known as the Royal Sporting Club of Cascais but the use of ‚Äúroyal‚Äù was dropped after the establishment of the First Portuguese Republic. The club was disbanded in 1974. Its documentation is retained in the Cascais Municipal Archives, held at the nearby Casa Sommer. The museum In 1976, the building became the property of the Municipality of Cascais. Planning of the museum began in 1978 but it was not opened until 1992. It was expanded in 1997 with a new exhibition space devoted to maritime ethnography, which aimed to increase understanding of the fishing community of Cascais. Further expansion was carried out in 2006 with the opening of a room dedicated to underwater archaeology, primarily shipwrecks. Improvements continued in 2008 with the main octagonal room and the People of the Seas room, dedicated to the history and experiences of the fishing community of the town, with models of fisherfolk and examples of their clothing and nets. There is also a boat gallery with models of fishing boats and pleasure crafts that once sailed in the River Tagus, which meets the sea close to Cascais. A further exhibit covers ‚ÄúKing Carlos and Oceanographic Science‚Äù. This project was a collaboration of several institutions, including the Vasco da Gama Aquarium, the Portuguese Navy Museum, the Natural History Museum of London, and the Oceanographic Museum of Monaco, among others, and reconstructs the main research activities of the king and his team aboard the yacht Am√©lia IV. Another exhibit relates to the Portuguese Navy and Navigation. Navigational instruments including compasses and lanterns, together with bronze gun dating from the seventeenth century, are displayed. A section is also devoted to biodiversity with models of mammals displayed including a porcupinefish, a Bottlenose skate, various types of sharks including the sevengilled shark, Atlantic bluefin tuna, the sperm whale and the pygmy sperm whale. The museum's collection of marine fossils is also exhibited as part of an exhibition entitled ‚ÄúThe Sea and the Origin of Life‚Äù. This was developed through collaboration with foreign institutions and with researchers from the National Museum of Natural History and Science, which is attached to the University of Lisbon.

She was named for Grace [Fletcher] Webster, the wife of her father's uncle, Daniel Webster. Hinsdale spent her youth in her native town, and received a private education there. Early in life, she developed a religious temperament that prompted her most successful literary work. Career On October 30, 1850, at the age of eighteen, she married Theodore Hinsdale (died 1880), a lawyer, of New York City, and a resident of Brooklyn, where they made their home. Her early writing were contributed to Hours at Home, a magazine, which afterwards became Scribner's Magazine, and she has also contributed verse and prose articles to a large number of periodicals, chiefly religious, including the Boston Congregationalist, Independent, Sunday School Times, and Christian Union. In 1865, she published two books, Coming to the King: a Book of Daily Devotions for Children, and Thinking Aloud, both of which were republished by an English firm. Selections from her hymns, published first in Charles Seymour Robinson's and Dr. Richard Salter Storrs' Songs for the Sanctuary, and were copied in other hymn books. Several of her poems were in the collection, Christ in Song, compiled by Dr. Philip Schaff. Many works on hymnody contain notices of her work. In 1867, Hinsdale traveled abroad, gathering new inspirations. Hinsdale was a frequent contributor of religious poetry to the periodical press. In 1872, Hinsdale composed a poem, ‚ÄúThe Faithful Guard,‚Äù to be sung at the laying of the cornerstone of the 23rd Regiment Armory. Her poem on Raphael's Madonna d√™ San Sisto, in the Royal Gallery of Dresden, frequently copied, was written in Europe in 1867. Hinsdale read these verses in public, and also her poem, entitled, ‚ÄúThe Old Cathedral.‚Äù Personal life Hinsdale made her home at Mansion House, Brooklyn. Her children were: Charles (1851-1857), Grace (1854-1857, Theodore (1856-1857), Guy (b. 1858), Theodora (1860-1885), Frank (b. 1862), and Grace (b. 1874). Hinsdale died August 31, 1902, and was buried at Green-Wood Cemetery, Brooklyn. Reception Her hymns were characterized by a depth of earnestness, a truly religious motive distinguishing them from much light literature or hymnody born within the end of the 20th century. The Brooklyn Eagle described her hymns as ‚Äúcharacterized by a depth of earnestness, a truly religious motive distinguishing them from the light literature of \\"born within the last few years.‚Äù Selected works * Coming to the King, 1865 * Thinking Aloud, 1865 NotesReferences=Bibliography=   External links * 1832 births 1902 deaths 19th-century American writers 19th- century American women writers Burials at Green-Wood Cemetery ","title":"Grace Webster Haddock Hinsdale"},{"id":"56453606","text":"Agnes Wright Spring Agnes Wright Spring (January 5, 1894 ‚Äì March 20, 1988) was a journalist, writer and historian from Wyoming who wrote books focusing on Wyoming and Western history.

His early years in the profession were uninspiring, and his progress slow, leading him to consider other employment, until he conceived of going to India. Morgan served as a puisne judge at Calcutta (where, with his mastery of equity law, he was considered 'one of the most well-informed legal men' there) before being promoted to Chief Justice at Allahabad, where he served from 1866 to 1871, having also been knighted. While Swami Vivekananda's father Vishwanath Datta applied to be enrolled as an attorney-at-law, Morgan approved the prayer. His reputation continued to increase during this period, which stood him in good stead to take the position of Chief Justice at Calcutta, Bombay or Madras.The Lawyer, vol. 2, 1970, pg 90 With no opening at Calcutta or Bombay, Morgan was appointed Chief Justice of the Madras High Court, where he remained until 7 February 1879. Although Morgan was respected during his time at Madras, he was not a loved figure to either the Bar or the public; some were critical of him, and he was perceived as 'chill' and 'colourless'.

Architecture The Odysseas Elytis Theatre was modelled on ancient theatres of Greece and Lower Italy. The Theatre can accommodate 1,100 spectators in its stands, which are made out of marble. For rest of the building of the theatre, local stone was used. The stage has a diameter of 12 meters. The seats are oriented toward the south offering a view of the Aegean and protecting the spectators from the summer winds. Name The theatre is named after the Greek poet Odysseas Elytis. The name Odysseas is the modern Greek version of the name Odysseus, the protagonist of Homer's Odyssey. Homer is closely associated with the island given the fact that according to all sources he died on the island. Events The Municipality of Ios, in cooperation with the local touristic Development Company, organizes annually concerts with great Greek and foreign artists at the Theatre. In honor of Homer who died in island, a cultural festival named ŒüŒúŒóŒ°ŒïŒôŒë (\\"OMIRIA\\"(from ŒüŒúŒóŒ°(ŒüŒ£) - HOMER + ŒïŒôŒë) is organized every year with artistic and cultural activities.

Monkey bites account for 2‚Äì21% of animal bite injuries. Monkey bites are an important risk among travelers and after dog bites is the most common animal bite for travelers. Treatment depends upon many factors including the suspicion of rabies. Management involves: * wound cleansing and care * prophylactic antibiotics * post-bite rabies treatment * post-bite tetanus treatment Serious infections can result after a monkey bite. Simian herpes B virus is endemic in some species of Asian monkeys. It was first identified by an investigator was bitten by what appeared to be a healthy monkey. The investigator died shortly thereafter from brain inflammation (encephalitis). Subsequent simian-acquired infections with this virus have occurred with mortality rate as high as 80%. Currently, transmission of the virus through a monkey bite almost always is the result of an occupational exposure by biomedical research workers. The progression of the infection has been described: \\"[The infection presents with] herpetic skin lesions and sensory changes [are visible] near the exposure site, fever and nonspecific flu-like myalgias and headaches, fatigue, and progressive neurologic impairment, including dyspnea. Once the central nervous system is involved, the outcome is invariably fatal. But with the deployment of antiviral therapy, both for prophylaxis and treatment, cases are now infrequent and deaths are rare, although they have occurred.\\" Prevention is accomplished through education and traveler's warnings. Prevention also includes the surveillance for the presence of rabies within monkey populations. Research is lacking in the assessment of the impact of monkey bites. From 1960 to 2013, 159 cases of rabies infections in humans have been documented as a result of monkey bites. These numbers were gathered from records of traveler's injuries and the prevalence of monkey bites in area residents is assumed to be much higher.

Concept In the 1930s ≈†koda introduced a new range of cars built on a backbone chassis. First came the Popular compact car in 1934, followed by the Superb full-size car. The mid-range Rapid was added in 1935. The Favorit was the last to be launched, entering production in 1936. It is a mid-range model, larger and more powerful than the Rapid but smaller and more economical than the Superb. Type 904 The Favorit Type 904 has a four-cylinder 1,802 cc sidevalve engine that produces and gives it a top speed of . At a steady its fuel consumption is 14 or 15 litres per 100 km. The choice of bodies offered included a two-door saloon and a four-door \\"six-light\\" saloon. There was also an ambulance version. Sales were disappointing. ≈†koda persisted with the 904 for three years, but when it ceased production in 1939 only 169 had been built. ≈†koda Favorit in the ≈†koda museum at Mlad√° Boleslav Type 923 ≈†koda revised the engine and in 1938 launched the Type 923, which it marketed as the Favorit 2000 OHV. ≈†koda had enlarged the engine to 2,091 cc and given it overhead valves, which increased output to and its top speed to . Increased performance did not increase sales. ≈†koda had built only 54 of the 2000 OHV type when it ceased production in 1941. From 1939 ≈†koda used the 2,091 cc OHV engine in a new 1.5 tonne truck, the ≈†koda 150. After the Second World War the truck continued in production, first as the Aero 150 and then as the Praga A150, until 1951.

He was best known for investigating practical applications making use of the light-sensitivity properties of selenium, which he employed in developing wireless telephony using line-of-sight optical transmissions, sound-on-film audio recording, and television transmissions over wires. Career Ruhmer's father was an inventor and manufacturer. From 1897 to 1900 he studied mathematics and natural sciences in Berlin, and the next year continued his studies in Giessen. His early work included extensive research in developing selenium cells that were more sensitive, and faster reacting, to the effects of light illumination. In December 1902 he and Salomon Kalischer were issued German patent 151,971 for their method of producing photographic images by exposing electrically conductive selenium-coated plates.\\"Herstellung von photographischen Bildern durch Belichtung von elektrisch leitenden, mit Selen Aberzogenen Platten\\", Chemiker-Zeitung (in German), June 15, 1904, page 578. Ruhmer also designed a light-sensitive control switch, using a selenium cell, which was successfully used to automatically turn off the flow of a buoy's illuminating gas during daylight hours.\\"The Properties and Applications of Selenium\\", Radium and Other Radioactive Substances by William J. Hammer, April 17, 1903 lecture, page 57. In 1904 he established a private physics laboratory, located in southwest Berlin.\\"Fernsehleute im Spannungsdeld zwischen Fortschritt und Reaktion\\" by Manfred Hempel (in German), included in Die Anf√§nge des Deutschen Fernsehens, 1991, page 16. =Wireless telephony=Photophone Ruhmer pictured listening to his \\"photo-electric\\" optical telephone system (1905)Cover page Technical World, March 1905. Ruhmer first gained widespread recognition for his work on improvements to Alexander Graham Bell's optical wireless telephone, the photophone. Bell introduced this device in 1880, which used selenium cells in the receiver to convert the fluctuating light produced by the transmitting unit into sounds. But Bell's invention only had a range of a few hundred meters, and he soon ended his research into this device. Ruhmer believed that the increased sensitivity of his selenium cells, combined with the superior receiving capabilities of professor H. T. Simon's \\"speaking arc\\", would make the photophone practical over longer signalling distances. Ruhmer carried out a series of experimental transmissions along the Havel river and on Lake Wannsee from 1901 to 1902. He reported achieving sending distances under good conditions of 15 kilometers (9 miles),\\"Correspondence: Wireless Telephony\\" (October 30, 1902 letter from Ernst Ruhmer), The Electrician, November 7, 1902, page 111. with equal success during the day and at night, although the longest transmissions were dependent on having clear weather. He continued his experiments around Berlin through 1904, in conjunction with the German Navy, which supplied high-powered searchlights for use in the transmissions.Wireless Telephony In Theory and Practice by Ernst Ruhmer, 1908, pages 49-59. Radiotelephone Ruhmer also carried out research in making audio transmissions using radio signals. In 1904, he was granted, along with Adolf Pieper, German patent 173,396, \\"A Process for Generating Permanently Undamped Electrical Oscillations\\", which described a method for creating \\"continuous wave\\" transmissions using a mercury-vapor vacuum-tube.Wireless From Marconi's Black-Box to the Audion by Hong Sungook, 2001, page 166. In 1904 he developed a high-speed alternator which produced transmitting frequencies of up to 120,000 cycles-per-second. However, this effort never got beyond a basic prototype that generated less than .001 watt.Ruhmer (1908) page 134 Ruhmer's radiotelephone transmitter, circa 1905 Ruhmer also investigated radiotelephone transmissions using a high- frequency spark transmitter.Goldsmith, Alfred N. (1918) Radio Telephony, pages 46-48 This work took place during winter 1904-5, however, this approach had limited results, as he later noted that \\"the transmitted speech received on microphonic contact and telephone was rough and broken like that of a stammerer\\".Ruhmer (1908) page 118 In 1906, employing a design largely based on the hydrogen arc transmitter developed by Denmark's Valdemar Poulsen, he reported that he had constructed a transmitter capable of producing frequencies up to 300,000 cycles-per-second. Although the quality of the resulting audio transmissions were \\"strikingly good\\", and he felt that transmission range could be extended to several kilometers, these tests were only conducted over a distance of 500 meters.Ruhmer (1908) pages 166-167 Ruhmer also investigated carrier current transmissions (then commonly known as \\"wired wireless\\"), where multiple radio signals are transmitted along an electrical conductor, which acts as a wave guide carrying the signals to designated locations. In 1911, it was reported that during a recent demonstration, \\"four transmissions‚ÄîGerman, French, song and gramophone music respectively‚Äîwere effected simultaneously, but the number can obviously be increased considerably without any disturbance\\".\\"Ruhmer's Multiplex Telephony\\", Technical World, September 1911, page 128. In 1907 Ruhmer wrote Drahtlose Telephonie, which was translated by James Erskine-Murray and published in 1908 as Wireless Telephony In Theory and Practice.Wireless Telephony In Theory and Practice by Ernst Ruhmer (translated from the German by James Erskine-Murray), 1908. This book reviewed the various technologies being investigated for wireless telephony, including both optical telephone research and the newer radiotelephone developments. Radio transmissions were soon recognized to be superior for most applications, as they were unaffected by weather, and were not limited to line-of-sight transmissions. =Sound-on- film recording= In 1900, as part of his optical wireless telephone research, Ruhmer recorded the fluctuations of the transmitting arc-light as varying shades of light and dark bands onto a continuous roll of photographic film. He then determined that he could reverse the process and reproduce the recorded sound from this photographic strip, by shining a bright light through the running filmstrip, with the resulting varying light illuminating a selenium cell. The changes in brightness caused a corresponding change in the selenium's resistance to electrical currents, which was used to modulate the sound produced in a telephone receiver. He summarized the results as: \\"It is truly a wonderful process: sound becomes electricity, becomes light, causes chemical actions, becomes light and electricity again, and finally sound.\\"Ruhmer (1908) page 39 He called this invention the photographophone.\\"The Photographophone\\" by Ernst Ruhmer, Scientific American, July 20, 1901, page 36. The general concept would eventually be adopted for producing sound movies. =Television= Ruhmer demonstrating his experimental television system, which was capable of transmitting images of simple shapes over telephone lines, using a 25-element selenium cell receiver (1909)\\"Another Electric Distance-Seer\\", Literary Digest, September 11, 1909, page 385. Ruhmer also researched using selenium cells as the picture elements for a television receiver. In late 1909 he successfully demonstrated in Belgium the transmission of simple images over a telephone wire from the Palace of Justice at Brussels to the city of Liege, a distance of 115 kilometers (72 miles). This demonstration was described at the time as \\"the world's first working model of television apparatus\\".\\"Seeing by Wire\\", Industrial World, January 31, 1910, pages viii-x (reprinted from the London Mail). However, his device consisted of only 25 cells, thus was only capable of representing simple geometric shapes. Ruhmer was confident that producing a system capable of higher definition images \\"was only a matter of money\\". However, at the cost of ¬£15 (US$45) per selenium cell, he estimated that a 4,000 cell system would cost ¬£60,000 (US$180,000), and a 10,000 cell mechanism capable of reproducing \\"a scene or event requiring the background of a landscape\\" would cost ¬£150,000 (US$450,000). Because of the high cost, he didn't foresee his device as suitable for private home use, instead envisioning that central offices in major cities could be established, and customers would make arrangements to make use of the service. Ruhmer expressed the hope that the 1910 Brussels Exposition Universelle et Internationale would sponsor the construction of an advanced device with significantly more cells, as a showcase for the exposition. However, the estimated expense of ¬£250,000 (US$750,000) proved to be too high. Also, television research turned to using cathode ray tubes in receivers as a superior approach. Ruhmer's promising career was eventually cut short. He fell ill in 1912, and died the next year at the age of 34.\\"Pioneer Experiments of Eugene Lauste in Recording Sound\\" by Merritt Crawford, Journal of the Society of Motion Picture Engineers, October 1931, page 644.

Life Joachim was born in 1869 and was educated at Girton College. Joachim was arrested in February 1908 for demonstrating outside the House of Commons. She was militant and a member of the hard line Women's Social and Political Union which was led by Emmeline Pankhurst. She enjoyed the camaraderie and reflected that she was now with people with the same purpose. She was sentenced to six weeks imprisonment, but by June she was arrested again after an attempt to visit the Prime Minister, along with Mrs Pankhurst, Emmeline Pethick- Lawrence, Jessie Stephenson and Florence Haig. Maud Joachim was thwarted and a crowd rushed the police. Joachim was sentenced to three months in Holloway Prison. In 1909 she was in Scotland working in Aberdeen. That November she joined a protest that disturbed a talk by Winston Churchill at his constituency in Dundee. She was arrested along with Helen Archdale, Catherine Corbett and Adela Pankhurst and sentenced to ten days in prison. During her sentence she went on hunger strike and became the first woman in Scotland to take this form of protest. Mary's brother William Blathwayt and Joachim at Eagle House in 1910 Eagle House near Bath in Somerset had become an important refuge for suffragettes who had been released from prison after hunger strikes. Mary Blathwayt's parents planted trees there between April 1909 and July 1911 to commemorate the achievements of suffragettes including Emmeline Pankhurst, Christabel Pankhurst, Annie Kenney, Charlotte Despard, Millicent Fawcett and Lady Lytton.

In an imaginative protest organised with Katherine Douglas Smith Joachim held up traffic in the West End by the two riding black bay horses up the Strand, at the same time advertising a suffragette meeting at the Royal Albert Hall. On her death Joachim left Smith a legacy in her will.Biography of Katherine Douglas Smith - Suffragette Stories Joachim was invited to Eagle House in 1910.

Izidorius Pocius was born into a poor peasants' family.LVIA, f. 669, ap. 21 His father was a village musician who would travel from one village to another. Izidorius spent most of his childhood in the village of Pagiriai (current Jurbarkas District Municipality), where the family finally moved and settled in the early 1870s. Izidorius's mother died while giving birth, when Izidorius was still small. All the younger brothers and sisters of Izidorius died in their childhood, already before the death of their mother. Izidorius's father, a widower, got married for the second time and had more children. Izidorius grew up with his father, step-mother and half-brothers and sisters. Izidorius joined the Lithuanian book smugglers movement presumably after reaching adulthood. He collaborated with many book smugglers from Rossiyensky Uyezd, such as Jonas ≈†vedas, Viktoras Alijo≈°ius, and Juozas Sakalauskas, among others. He helped Rev. Julijonas Jasienskis, the chief editor of the newspaper Cross (Kry≈æius) and a chaplain serving in Palanga Progymnasium, to deliver the manuscripts to the printing houses in Lithuania Minor.Benjaminas Kalu≈°keviƒçius, Kazys Misius.

He would then bind the books and distribute them inside Rossiyensky Uyezd.Benjaminas Kalu≈°keviƒçius, Kazys Misius. Lietuvos knygne≈°iai ir daraktoriai 1864‚Äì1904, 2004, Vilnius, pp. 3894, Diemedis Printing house, After having become a skilled book smuggler he passed on his experience to the younger book smugglers. It is documented that Izidorius Pocius introduced Jonas Pakatinskas-Katiliukas, who later became a famous book smuggler, and his brother Kazimiras to the activities by taking them along to Tilsit in 1892.Benjaminas Kalu≈°keviƒçius, Kazys Misius. Lietuvos knygne≈°iai ir daraktoriai 1864‚Äì1904, 2004, Vilnius, pp. 3593, Diemedis Printing house, In 1893, forty-six Lithuanian books were confiscated by the police in Panevƒó≈æys from Izidorius, while he was penalised with one month's confinement in police custody for a month on the orders of the governor-general of the Vilna Governorate. Five years later he was caught again, this time carrying nine books in ≈†iauliai and put in police custody for one month again in December 1898. He was arrested again in 1900 in Truskava. He was beaten by the police on the way from one confinement place to another. Izidorius consequently fell ill as a result of the beatings and poor conditions during the confinement and lost his sanity. He would reportedly spend the rest of his life wandering around, always carrying a leather basket used for transporting smuggled books on his shoulders and holding an eight-edged gnarled stick. Starting from 1928, he would receive a pension of 50 litas a month, designated for former Lithuanian book smugglers, but he would constantly run out of money, according to his contemporaries. Izidorius passed away around 1935, presumably in Er≈ævilkas volost, Lithuania, even though the exact place and date are unknown. His nephew Antanas Pocius was a Lithuanian organist and composer.

His first works on canvas offer filiform characters in postures expressing pain and seeking deliverance. His later works became very urban writings, similar to graffiti. His experiments led him to work in three dimensions, volume representing the characters of his first paintings, interpreting the poverty of amorphous people left to themselves. He works with other materials such as aluminum foil, which he paints and scratches, or Plexiglas sheets, also scratched up, which with light creates games of shadows. In terms of public art, he is the author of one of the four works outside of the series Art‚Äôventure, offered by doual‚Äôart to the city of Douala in 1992.

It has a single thin leaf fused to the flowering stem and up to thirty three small, lemon scented, dark purplish black flowers. It usually grows under shrubs in shallow sandstone soil in the Blue Mountains. Description Genoplesium citriodorum is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single thin leaf long and fused to the flowering stem with the free part long. Between twenty and thirty three dark purplish black flowers are arranged along a flowering stem tall and taller than the leaf. The flowers are about long and wide and lean forward. As with others in the genus, the flowers are inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The dorsal sepal is narrow egg-shaped, about long and wide with prominent red lines and sparsely hairy edges. The lateral sepals are about long, wide, turn downwards and spread widely apart from each other. The petals are narrow egg-shaped, about long, wide with prominent stripes and hairy edges. The labellum is purple, narrow egg-shaped, about long, wide, with many hairs up to on its edges. There is a dark reddish purple callus in the centre of the labellum and extending two-thirds of the way to its tip. Flowering occurs between December and April. Taxonomy and naming The lemon scented midge orchid was first formally described in 1991 by David Jones and Mark Clements who gave it the name Genoplesium citriodorum and published the description in Australian Orchid Research. In 2002, Jones and Clements changed the name to Corunastylis citriodora. The specific epithet (citriodorum) is derived from the Latin words citrea meaning \\"the citron-tree\\" and odor meaning \\"smell\\", referring to the strongly lemon-scented flowers.

The company was later known as Aerostar. The AG-6 was a single-engine biplane, of which a single example was built, with no production following. Design and development In 1986, a team led by the engineer Constantin Rosca began work at the Romanian Aviation Institute on the design of a single-engine agricultural aircraft, the AG-6. The AG-6 was a single-engine tractor biplane with a fixed tailwheel undercarriage, and had a similar layout to the American Grumman Ag-Cat. The aircraft's fuselage was of welded steel tube construction, with the forward fuselage and wings covered in duralumin and the rear fuselage fabric covered. The pilot sat in an enclosed cockpit aft of the wings, with a glassfibre hopper for liquid or powered agricultural chemicals fitted forward of the cockpit. The aircraft was powered by a Soviet Vedeneyev M14P radial engine, rated at which drove a two-bladed variable-pitch propeller. A prototype was built at the BacƒÉu factory of IAv (Intreprinderea de Avione) (now Aerostar), making its first flight on 12 January 1989. In 1991, the Romanian aircraft industry was privatised, but a shortage of finance resulted in several projects, including the AG-6, being abandoned. Only the single prototype was built.

Biography Joseph Francis Sum√©gn√©, La Nouvelle Libert√©, 1996 Influenced by the engravings and the tattoos that he observed on his grandmother's body and pillars of the royal houses to the west of Cameroon, he drew a lot during his childhood in the village. He then got introduced to different types of artistic practices (sculpture, colorization, jewelry, basketry and weaving), the combination of which will characterize his future work. His works are marked by the influences of traditional sculpture in his home region.Joseph Francis Sum√©gn√© in \\"Africultures\\". The fusion of found objects linked with copper wire and stitches that he invents, confront the challenge of the free volume. Concretizing his desires, pains, passions, indignations and dreams through his sculptures, Sum√©gn√© invents his philosophy and his technique of JALA'A to manifest and magnify self-transcendence. The topics addressed by Sum√©gn√© are multiple: masks and characters of traditional powers, men and women on the move (dancers, pushed-pushers), scenes out of his daily environment. Invited to a do a residency in Douala by doual'art for three years, from 1993 to 1996, Sum√©gn√© made his La Nouvelle Libert√©, a monumental sculpture of 12 meters in height. He has been invited to create outdoor works in Gabon, France and Germany. His latest urban creation was Le monument pour la Paix for the contemporary art biennale of Bangui, in the Central African Republic. He has exhibited in several countries, including Japan for the triennial of Osaka (1998) and the Netherlands for the triennial of Arnhem (2008). In 2004, he participated in the biennale of Dakar (Senegal), in a one-man show in the official selection, where he presented his series of sculptures Les neufs notables to an international audience for the first time.

Her book A Romance of the Road is a manifesto of the suffragist argument. Biography Alice Curtice Moyer Wing was born in 1866 in Du Quoin, Illinois. While still a baby the family moved to Southwest Missouri, where they were pioneers in Dallas County. In A Romance of the Road, Alice described her parents as \\"a sturdy young father who cleared and tilled the soil, making what use he could of this Eastern education by teaching the district school in the winter, and ... a pretty young mother, who was never too busy to put on a clean collar (of her own crocheting) when he was expected from the field.\\" The Romance of the Road was a bright, entertaining, good book, full of practical knowledge and everyday events which were made so heartfelt and interesting that one felt the better for having read it. Moyer was the eldest of six children; five were born in Missouri; they lived on the homestead until she was fifteen, when her parents moved into the county seat so their children could have a better education, but the teaching was meagre and the instruction of her father aided her more than her schooling. Life on the homestead taught her resourcefulness, and how to endure discomforts, for they were pioneer children and faced many hardships. Her father, Charles L. Curtice, was a New Yorker by birth, but was in the Sixth Illinois Cavalry, during the Civil War, and had a service of four years and seven months to his credit. Her mother was Nancy Elizabeth Tinsley, of Tennessee, whose father, of English ancestry, was a Virginian. Through her father she was related to the Wing family: his mother was Miriam Wing, of Hoosick, New York. Through a daughter of Rev. Stephen Bachelder (or Bachelor), Deborah (wife of Rev. John Wing), she can trace her ancestry back to the famous preacher and reformer, who was vicar of Whersvell, Hants, England, before coming to Ainerica. By reason of her ancestral connection from the Rev. Stephen Bachelder (or Bachelor), she was eligible for membership in the Colonial Dames of America, and through David Wing, a Quaker of Providence, who served in the War of the Revolution as an enlisted soldier in Col. John Blair's regiment, Albany County Militia, she was eligible for membership in the Daughters of the American Revolution. Moyer shares ancestral claims on the Rev. Bachelor with Daniel Webster, J. G. Whittier and other writers. In the early 1900s, the \\"Wing Family of America\\" held a reunion which brought many of the estimated 100,000 relatives to the family camp fires. Tuner C. Wing, president of the Gorman Paint Company, of which firm Moyer was secretary and treasurer, was a prominent St. Louis member of the Wing Family and in 1915 Moyer married him. Sir Arthur Wing Pinero, the playwright, was a member of the English branch of the Wing family. Alice Curtice Moyer, Gerhard Sisters While her children, Selma Van Buskirk and Charles Curtice Moyer, were quite small, it became necessary for Moyer to support her family at the death of her first husband, Alberson Moyer. She took the surest way into the business world for a woman, that of stenographer, and came to St. Louis from El Paso, Texas, to take up this study. At the end of ten weeks she took a position for a year and a half in that capacity, and then moved to Kansas, where she became correspondent for a manufacturing concern. Always keeping her children with her, she studied with them and sewed for them at night after office hours. In addition to this she wrote stories for a juvenile paper, and now and then for magazines and newspapers. She said, as Sir Walter Raleigh said of himself, \\"I can toil terribly.\\" It was while in Kansas that Alice began her work in the suffrage movement. After five years in Kansas, the threat of a nervous breakdown sent her on the road as a commercial traveler, a position which she held for five years. During this period, her children made their home with their grandparents, who still lived where Moyer spent her girlhood days, in Buffalo, Dallas County. With her health restored by the road work, she again held office positions as correspondent, department manager, district manager, and instructor for traveling forces in Kansas City, Chicago, and Birmingham, moving to St. Louis in February, 1913, to be secretary and treasurer of the Gorman Paint Company. Moyer headed the speakers bureau of the St Louis Equal Suffrage League and was selected as the St. Louis member of the State Suffrage Press Committee. In 1916 the Moyer Wings moved to rural Wayne County Missouri and lived on a farm northeast of the county seat in Greenville near Burbank. That move from St Louis followed an incident during which Alice was accosted on the street in St. Louis following one of her suffrage speeches and was choked by a man who threatened her life if she persisted in speaking for equal suffrage. In 1917-18, she resumed her suffrage work in a horseback campaign across the Ozarks. She rode the eastern Missouri Ozarks with her horse, LaBelle, and chronicled her efforts promoting equal suffrage in a series of humorous articles in the St. Louis Post Dispatch Sunday magazine In the 1920s she commuted from Greenville to St. Louis, Kansas City, and Jefferson City while she worked as chief of the State Industrial Inspection Department under Governor Arthur M. Hyde. She was reappointed in 1925 by Sam A. Baker. She was the first woman to head any state department in Missouri. She served until 1927 when the position was abolished in favor of the State Labor Department. During her terms in office, Moyer Wing lobbied against violators of the child labor laws, for the nine-hour law for women, and for reducing the number of industrial accidents. She appointed women as Industrial Inspectors and insisted that they be paid a salary equal to men in that position. In 1924 she unsuccessfully ran for the Republican nomination for congress in Missouri's 13th District. She remained an active member of the Missouri League of Women Voters and retired from public life but continued to write, publishing 3 articles in Scribner's Magazine (Men Only, Sept 1926; When a Woman is the Head, June 1927; and The Vote Our First Comeback, 1928 Scribner's 84:259-264). She died on August 16, 1937, and she is buried near her Wayne County home in the Crossroads Church Cemetery on Wayne County Route 502 northeast of Greenville. An interpretive panel about her life and work is displayed in the Greenville Recreation Area on US Route 67 at Wappapello Lake.

The game was released for Microsoft Windows on 16 May 2011 and received multiple updates later on. In February 2012, Re-Logic's developers announced that Terraria would be receiving one final bug-fix patch, but development resumed in 2013. At E3 2019, Re-Logic announced the final update to the game. Update 1.4 Journey's End was released on 16 May 2020. Re-Logic stated that they wanted to work on other projects after this update.

May 28, 1920 in Normandy, France ‚Äì d. January 8, 2009) was a French pastry chef known as a possible creator of the opera cake (g√¢teau op√©ra), the founder of \\"Len√¥tre\\" a culinary empire; whose brand includes restaurants, catering services, retail concerns and cooking schools, and one of the three founders with Paul Bocuse and Roger Verge of Les Chefs de France at EPCOT in Orlando, Florida. Biography Len√¥tre was born on a small farm in Normandy. Both of his parents eventually moved the family to Paris and became restaurant workers. Eventually his father's ill health forced them to move back to the province from which they came. Len√¥tre then had to struggle to find a position in a kitchen in Normandy. Prior to the outbreak of World War II he sold his homemade chocolate creations in Paris from a bicycle. Following the war, Len√¥tre opened a small bakery in Normandy. The venture was a success and in 1957 he came upon the opportunity to purchase a tiny bakery in the 16th Arrondissement of Paris. His new establishment did extremely well from the outset and is said to have presaged nouvelle cuisine. Len√¥tre was renowned for concentrating on simple preparations and fresh ingredients, and for insisting on using the best butter in his pastries. The year 1964 saw Len√¥tre enter the catering field. Due in large part to improvements in freezing food perishables, he was able to quickly expand the numbers of diners he was able to serve. The year 1971 saw Len√¥tre open his first cooking school in Plaisir, Yvelines France. Among the chefs who studied under Len√¥tre there was David Bouley and Jean-Paul Jeunet. The chef Pierre Herm√© was an apprentice of his, as was the pastry chef S√©bastien Canonne.\\"Dessert Professional‚Äôs Top Ten Pastry Chefs in North America 2015,\\" Dessert Professional, August 24, 2015. The chef Alain Ducasse also worked under him. In 1974 Len√¥tre dispatched another then apprentice of his Michel Richard to open Chateau France a restaurant and patisserie on the East Side of Manhattan in New York City to spotlight the Len√¥tre culinary style. It only stayed in business for a single year. Quickly bouncing back from this failed venture, in 1982 he opened les Chefs de France in the France Pavilion in Walt Disney World's Epcot Center together with Paul Bocuse and Roger Verg√©.Roger Verg√© in the Orlando Sentinel In 1985 the businesses under the banner head Len√¥tre were taken over by the French Hotel firm Accor.

Early life Roeloffs was born on 2 May 1844 in Hamburg, then an independent free city and member of the German Confederation. He grew up in Hamburg and had to leave school at the age of 13 to contribute to the family's livelihood. During the economic crisis of 1857 he became a clerk in the law firm Dres. Albrecht & G. Hertz.Aus der alten Ratsstube: Erinnerungen 1905‚Äì1918, by Adolf Buehl, publ. Hamburg 1973, pp. 46‚Äì51 From 1861, Roeoff was a court recorder at the Hamburg Commercial Court under Johannes Versmann, who had been elected to the Hamburg Senate the same year. In 1864, when Versmann was President of the Deputation for Indirect Taxes and Duties, he offered to Roeloffs the post of interim customs guard and excise-guard, which Roeloffs accepted. Roeloffs quickly became the expert on tax issues in the Hamburg State Administration and belonged to the Deputation until his retirement in 1913.Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie: Johannes Vermann, Vol. 54 (1908), pp. 743‚Äì746 Customs issues In the constitutional negotiations of the North German Federation, Roeloffs was appointed as an advisor to Senator Gustav Heinrich Kirchenpauer for the issue of exclusions from the German Customs Union. Roeloffs was considered to be economically educated, since he was in the years 1864 to 1868 listener to the public lectures of Adolf Soetbeer and Ludwig Aegidi in Hamburg. From 1870, Roeloff became one of Versmann's closest associates. He accompanied Versmann in all negotiations regarding customs issues. In 1880, he was appointed First Secretary of the Deputation for Indirect Taxes. Accession of Hamburg to the Customs Union In May 1879, the Imperial Chancellor asked the Hamburg Senate to accede to the German Customs Union as provided for in Article 34 of the Constitution. The Senate rejected this, citing the effect on the city's maritime trade, especially with the new high external tariff of the Customs Union.Hamburg and the Freeport - Economy and Society 1888‚Äì-1914, by Peter Borowsky, publ Hamburg University Press, Hamburg, 2005; pp.110 and 114-115 In the autumn of 1880, Roeloffs, with senators Versmann and O'Swald, and Arthur Lutteroth, made a fact-finding journey to Antwerp, Rotterdam, Amsterdam, London, and Liverpool, in order to clarify the basis on which Hamburg could negotiate terms with Prussia. In December, 1880, and at the beginning of the year 1881, Roeloffs, Versmann and O'Swald, had \\"informational discussions\\" with the Prussian Superior Customs Inspector Klostermann and the Prussian Finance Minister Karl Hermann Bitter. Versmann negotiated the political issues, while Roeloffs dealt with the technical issues. On 25 March 1881, Versmann proposed to the Senate of Hamburg and the Imperial Government that real negotiations should begin. In April he conducted these negotiations in Berlin with Roeloffs and Senator O'Swald. Eventually an agreement was reached and this was ratified by the Federal Council (Bundesrat) on 25 June 1881. The result of the negotiations, which largely fulfilled the Hamburg wishes, was in large part the results of Roeloff's work. The agreement was that Hamburg would join the Customs Union with all its territory, except for a free port district which it specified. For this district, Article 34 would still apply, thus the freedoms of that district could not be abolished without Hamburg's approval. In 1885 the HFLG (Hamburger Freihafen-Lagerhaus Gesellschaft) was founded for the construction and impartial leasing of storage facilities in the Hamburg Free port (free trade zone). In the period remaining prior to Hamburg's accession to the Customs Union in 1888, sufficient space had to be created on the free port area for the storage and processing of the goods, which had previously been spread over the entire urban area of Hamburg.History of the Speicherstadt on web site of the HHLA - formerly known as HFLG. Site: hhla.de/de/historie/speicherstadt/geschichte.html Retrieved Jan 2018 After Prussian State Railways acquired the Berlin-Hamburg Railway, the director Adolf G√∂tting lost his position.

After the successful accession to the Customs Union and the establishment of the Free Port with the rebuilt central harbour area, both in 1888, Roeloffs was appointed Senate Syndicus (who was a non-voting participant in the Senate) the next year in 1889. Roeloffs was Syndicus from 1889 to 1912. He acquired in various administrative functions a comprehensive knowledge of all customs and trade issues and had a lasting influence on the way Hamburg acceded to the Customs Union. There were several proposals to elect Roeloffs as senator. But this would have been possible only as a commercial senator, since he had no degree; he would have had a considerable loss of salary, so he never became a senator. In 1900 his wife had a rose variety named after her: Frau Syndica Roeloffs.

These metal nitrosyl complexes have attracted much attention because they serve as biochemical signals in response to oxidative stress, manifested in the formation of NO. The anions are tetrahedral.

His subject matter focuses on the American West, especially Native American historical and mythological figures of Southwestern United States. His works are held in the permanent collections of the Briscoe Western Art Museum, Desert Caballeros Western Museum, Joslyn Art Museum, Gilcrease Museum, National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum, Phoenix Art Museum, Tucson Museum of Art, and Western Spirit: Scottsdale's Museum of the West.  Early life and education  Coleman was born in 1949 in Southern California, and grew up in Manhattan Beach, California. He was the second child of three boys born to Mark and Jean Coleman. From a young age, he developed an interest in art, which was encouraged by his parents, especially his mother who used to take him to art stores during the family's trips to Laguna Beach. At the age of seventeen, he began working as an illustrator for a syndicated columnist and later at Butler Publications in California. However, Coleman never graduated from his California high school due to his learning difficulties caused by dyslexia. After marrying his high school girlfriend Sue Coleman, the couple moved to Parker, Arizona, where they had a business selling awnings for mobile homes.  Career  Coleman eventually became a real estate developer in Arizona. In 1972, he and his wife moved to Prescott, Arizona. They purchased an 11-acre mobile home park, renovating it and acquiring the adjacent properties to develop several businesses including a storage facility, gas station, car wash and motel. The success of his business allowed him to dedicate his time to artistic pursuits. Coleman began sculpting in his early forties and only became a full-time sculptor in 1994. He re-immersed himself in the art world and his newly awakened appreciation for sculpture by attending classes at the Scottsdale Artist School. In 1999, Coleman became a member of National Sculpture Society, and was later inducted as a fellow of the professional sculptors society. With encouragement from Ray Swanson, the former president of the Cowboy Artists of America (CAA), he applied to join and was inducted into the CAA in 2001. Coleman himself would later serve as president of the CAA in 2009. Beginning in 2004, Coleman created a series of sculptures based on the works of Karl Bodmer and George Catlin, artists and explorers of the American West. His interest in Bodmer and Catlin began a decade prior as he was researching Native American attire and became fascinated by the two artists' unique works which are rare representations of Native Americans before the advent of the photograph. The first life-sized sculpture from this series, Addih-Hiddisch, Hidatsa Chief won the gold medal in sculpture and the Kieckhefer Award for Best of Show at CAA's Sale & Exhibition in 2004. The piece is currently held in the permanent collection of the Phoenix Art Museum and the Joslyn Art Museum Sculpture Garden. In 2012, Coleman created and donated a new piece named The Greeter, Black Moccasin Meeting Lewis & Clark to be installed at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York. The eighty-percent life-size statue depicts the Hidatsa chief and is based on a painting by Catlin who was later buried in the Gregory family plot, to which this statue will serve as a marker. Another notable work by Coleman, Visions of Change is a large bronze sculpture depicting a Native American atop a hill overlooking a stampede of bison juxtaposed against an American cowboy standing over a group of Longhorns also streaming down what appears like the other side of the hill. The sculpture is in the permanent collection of the Tucson Museum of Art.  Personal life  Coleman married Sue Coleman when he was nineteen years old. They had attended the same high school and now live in Prescott, Arizona, where he has an art studio and private showroom. The Colemans have two daughters and five grandchildren.

It is one of the midge orchids and has a single thin leaf fused to the flowering stem and up to twenty small, green flowers with purple markings. It is a rare species, found only in a small area in the south-east of the state. Description Corunastylis capparina is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single thin leaf fused to the flowering stem. Between two and twenty flowers are arranged along a flowering stem long, reaching to a height of and taller than the leaf. The flowers are green with purple markings, sometimes entirely purple and are wide. As with others in the genus, the flowers are inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The dorsal sepal is broadly egg-shaped, about long and wide. The lateral sepals are linear to lance-shaped, long, wide and spread apart from each other. The petals are lance-shaped to egg-shaped, about long and wide with darker edges and a pointed tip. The labellum is wedge-shaped, thick and fleshy, long and wide with slightly wavy edges. There is a narrow egg-shaped callus in the centre of the labellum and extending almost to its tip. Flowering occurs in March and April. Taxonomy and naming Corunastylis capparina was first formally described in 2016 by David Jones from a specimen collected in the Blond Bay Wildlife Reserve and the description was published in the Australian Orchid Review. The specific epithet (capparina) is a vague Latin word meaning greenish-brown, referring to the colour of the flowers of this species. Julian Shaw has proposed changing the name of this orchid to Genoplesium capparinum. The World Checklist of Selected Plant Families lists both Genoplesium capparinum and Corunastyis capparina as \\"unplaced names\\".
