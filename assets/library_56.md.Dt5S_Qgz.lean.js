It was formerly a disposal site for petroleum waste products until a developer built residential homes on top of the field. The United States Environmental Protection Agency added the site to its National Priorities List of Superfund sites in 1992 and took it off in 2004 after extensive clean up efforts.  History  The land on which the 23 acre site sits was on the Murdy Dairy Farm. Beginning in 1936, the potentially responsible party, suspected to be Ralph Gray, the owner of the trucking company, acid sludge, oil field wastes, and oil refinery wastes and disposed of them in four unlined pits at the farm. After complaints from Westminster residents to local health officials and the Chamber of Commerce, Gray was fined $100 by a court and ordered to clean up the problem within 30 days. However he failed to do so, and the problem persisted until the 1950s. The Hintz Development Company moved the waste from the unlined pits to unlined trenches in 1958, burying the waste with several feet of soil under about 25 homes out of 75 in the whole residential development. Another five homes were built over the original pits. Residents started complaining of rising black sludge in 1965, which was semi solid in cooler weather but liquified in the warm summer air. Residents also complained as they discovered the sludge as they excavated in their backyards for swimming pools and other projects. = Cleanup Effort = The California Department of Health Services removed toxic seep as it emerged every year between 1987 and 1991. In 1992, the EPA began its clean up by temporarily evacuating residents from homes housing them in government funded hotels and rental units. A contractor excavated the surface waste seeps and buried wastes, removing about 45,000 cubic yards of hazardous waste and backfilling homes with clean material and replaced with further landscaping and improvements. The EPA took the site off the NPL in 2004 after cleanup was completed and soil tests found the worst contamination had been removed. = Health Concerns = The DHS completed several assessments and studies between 1988 and 1991 that found exposure for the waste was mostly through inhalation, ingestion, and skin contact. Children played with the seep material like ‚Äòsilly putty‚Äù and used the waste as chewing gum, while adults had skin discoloration and a burning sensation from handling the material during yard excavations. Asthma, allergies, and other respiratory problems plagued sensitive populations due to inhalation exposure.

Bennett, Ruth Mazo Karras, The Oxford Handbook of Women and Gender in Medieval Europe, Oxford University Press, 2013 Love service had certain resemblances with vassalage, especially the concept of obedience. According to Sandra R. Alfonsi the entire concept of love-service was patterned after the vassal‚Äôs oath to serve his lord with loyalty, tenacity, and courage. These same virtues were demanded of the male supplicant. Like the liegeman vis-a-vis his sovereign, the male approached his lady with fear and respect, submitted obediently to her and awaited a fief or in this case an honor of reception as did the vassal.Sandra R Alfonsi, Masculine Submission in Troubadour Lyric (American University Studies), Peter Lang Publishing, 1986 The vocabulary of love service borrowed some terminology from the vocabulary of feudalism indicative of the ties between a man to his lord. Examples are servitium (service), dominus (denoting the feudal Lord, or Lady), homo ligius (addressing the Lord's liegeman or 'my man'), homage (duty toward Lord), and honor (honoring gestures). The men were sometimes referred to as domnei or donnoi, meaning an attitude of chivalrous devotion of a knight to his Lady based in servitude and duty.Sandra R Alfonsi, Masculine Submission in Troubadour Lyric (American University Studies), Peter Lang Publishing, 1986  References  Love Medieval society ","title":"Love service"},{"id":"56538684","text":"The Joplin Miners are a planned professional baseball team based in team based in Joplin, Missouri.

It is a ground orchid with a single hairy leaf and a single relatively large, creamy-yellow flower, sometimes with reddish lines. The flowers have a smell resembling hot metal. Description Caladenia fuliginosa is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single, dull green, narrow lance-shaped leaf, long and wide with purple blotches near its base. The leaf and the flowering stem are densely covered with erect transparent hairs up to long. A single creamy-yellow flower wide smelling of hot metal is borne on a wiry flowering stem tall. The petals and sepals have thick, blackish glandular tips. The dorsal sepal is long, wide, oblong to elliptic near the base then tapering to a glandular tip about long and wide. The lateral sepals are lance- shaped near their bases, long, wide and taper to a narrow glandular tip similar to that on the dorsal sepal. The petals are long, wide, lance-shaped near the base then taper to a glandular tip similar to those on the sepals. The labellum is lance-shaped to egg-shaped, long, wide and has seven to ten pairs of linear teeth up to long on the edges. The tip of the labellum curls downward and there are six rows of purplish, mostly stalked calli along the mid-line of the labellum, the longest long and shaped like hockey sticks. Flowering occurs in late August and September. Taxonomy and naming Caladenia fuliginosa was first formally described in 2006 by David Jones, who gave it the name Arachnorchis fuliginosa and published the description in Australian Orchid Research from a specimen collected near Corny Point. In 2008, Robert Bates changed the name to Caladenia fuliginosa. The specific epithet (fuliginosa) is a Latin word meaning \\"sooty\\", referring to the blackish glandular tips on the sepals and petals. Distribution and habitat This spider orchid is only known from the southern part of the Flinders Ranges where it grows between rocks in sloping forest.

Life Heinrich Panofka portrayed by Vespasiano Bignami Panofka was born in Breslau (present-day Wroc≈Çaw) in 1807. As a child, he made rapid progress on the violin, and first performed in public aged ten. In 1824 he went to Breslau University to study law, according to the wishes of his father; afterward, following his own wishes, he went to Vienna where he was a student of the violinist Joseph Mayseder. In 1827 he performed successfully in Vienna and tried to follow up his success by traveling to Munich and Berlin. On the death of his father in 1831 he received his inheritance. Although in the following year he was persuaded by pianist Wenzeslaus Hauck to go on a concert tour through Germany, he gave up touring in 1833. In 1834 Panofka settled in Paris; here he met the singing teacher Marco Bordogni, and other singers including Giovanni Battista Rubini, Luigi Lablache and Domenico Donzelli. He became interested in the training of the voice, and with Bordogni he founded in 1842 an Acad√©mie de chant. He moved to London in 1844, and in 1847 was engaged by Benjamin Lumley as one of his assistants at Her Majesty's Theatre. He became known as a teacher and published A Practical Singing Tutor and other vocal studies. He returned to Paris in 1852; about 1855 he published L'art de chanter. It was translated into Italian and German, and was much discussed before it gained acceptance from musical institutes. From 1866 Panofka lived in Florence; he died in 1887. Works Other works by Panofka include compositions for violin and piano, and for violin and orchestra. He translated Pierre Baillot's L'art du violon into German.

Pel√©, scorer of seven hat-tricks for Brazil. Since Brazil's first international association football match in 1914, there have been 52 occasions when a Brazilian player has scored three or more goals (a hat-trick) in a game. The first hat-trick was scored by Arthur Friedenreich against Chile in 1919. The record for the most goals scored in an international by a Brazilian player is five, which has been achieved only by Evaristo de Macedo against Colombia in 1957. Pel√© holds the record for the most hat-tricks scored by a Brazilian player, with seven between 1958 and 1964., one of them in the World Cup finals. Besides Pel√©, the only Brazilian players to have scored a hat-trick at the World Cup finals were Le√¥nidas da Silva against Poland in 1938 and Ademir de Menezes against Sweden in 1950. The last Brazilian player to score a hat-trick was Paulinho, who scored three times against Uruguay in a World Cup qualifier in 2017. Brazil have conceded at least 11 hat-tricks in their history, 5 of them in matches against Argentina. the most recent, and undoubtedly the most famous, was scored by Paolo Rossi during the 1982 World Cup, which eliminated Brazil in that competition.

It is originally composed of 76 amino acids, with a molecular weight of 6017.5 Daltons, but loses 23 residues and becomes 53 residues long. As of today, SsTx is unique to Scolopendra subspinipes mutilans. By blocking KCNQ channels (preventing potassium from flowing into and out of cells) SsTx disrupts cardiovascular, respiratory, muscular, and nervous systems; where snake venoms typically only affect circulatory or nervous systems, and venom from spiders, scorpions, and snails typically only target nervous systems. This allows for golden headed centipedes to target larger prey up to 15 times their size.

It was established in 1918 and was replaced in 1966 by the Lutheran Council in the United States of America. History The celebration of the 400th anniversary of the Lutheran Reformation in 1917 led to the creation of the National Lutheran Commission for Soldiers' and Sailors' Welfare in October of that year, and the Lutheran Bureau (for publicity) in November. On July 17, 1918, the Executive Committee of the welfare commission, consisting of 15 members from the various Lutheran bodies, met in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and created an eight-member committee to plan for a national council. The planning committee then met in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on August 1, 1918. Finally, the National Lutheran Council was organized on September 6, 1918, in Chicago, Illinois. There were eight founding members of the NLC: *The Evangelical Lutheran General Synod of the United States of America (General Synod) *The General Council of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in North America (General Council) *The Evangelical Lutheran Joint Synod of Ohio and Other States (Ohio Joint Synod) *The Evangelical Lutheran Synod of Iowa and Other States (Iowa Synod) *The Evangelical Lutheran Augustana Synod in North America (Augustana Synod) *The Norwegian Lutheran Church of America (Norwegian Synod) *The Lutheran Free Church *The Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (Danish Church) The United Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in the South (United Synod South) joined shortly thereafter. Each church body had one representative on the council for every 100,000 confirmed members or one-third fraction thereof, with the proviso that each church body would have at least one representative. The NLC originally had no formal constitution other than a list of stated purposes. In 1926 a set of revised regulations was adopted. A formal constitution and bylaws were adopted in 1946 that, as a doctrinal basis, accepted the Bible as the Word of God and the only source, norm, and guide of Christian faith and life, and the Unaltered Augsburg Confession and Martin Luther's Catechism as the true exposition and presentation of the doctrine of the Bible. Soon after the organization of the NLC, the member bodies began a series of mergers. In 1918, the General Synod, General Council, and United Synod South merged to form the United Lutheran Church in America (ULCA). In 1930, the Ohio Joint Synod and the Iowa Synod merged into the first American Lutheran Church, and that body merged with the Norwegian Synod in 1960 to create the second American Lutheran Church (ALC). The Lutheran Free Church subsequently joined the ALC in 1963. Finally, the ULCA, the Danish Church, and the Augustana Synod merged in 1962 to form the Lutheran Church in America. These mergers resulted in the NLC having only two members, and at the end of 1966 it was superseded by the Lutheran Council in the United States of America. Functions When founded in 1918, the purposes of the NLC were to coordinate activities and agencies of the member bodies, provide statistical information, engage in publicity and public relations, and provide overseas relief to Lutherans affected by World War I. Those purposes broadened over time. The 1945 constitution and later amendments added such functions as making its member bodies aware of conditions to which they should speak or take action, representing the member bodies to federal and state governments and to other organizations, and to serve as the U.S. National Committee of the Lutheran World Federation, a body (originally named Lutheran World Convention) that it had been instrumental in creating in 1923.

He then very moved to the Op√©ra Garnier where he held the first roles for several years, as well as at the Salle Favart. His vocal timbre and athletic physique led him to perform in many theatres in France and abroad, where roles included Samson, Radames, Lohengrin, Rom√©o, Faust, Don Jos√©, Werther, Julien in Louise, Mario in Tosca, the Duke of Mantua (in Rigoletto), Turiddu and Pinkerton. At this time at the Op√©ra-Comique the frequent programming of Cavalleria Rusticana and Pagliacci allowed Botiaux to shine in this double-bill. His reputation in these roles during the 1960s spread to Japan and the USSR. The French provincial opera houses gave him two of his most noted roles: Vasco de Gama in L'Africaine by Meyerbeer, and Sigurd role in the eponymous opera by Reyer. In the same period, he was also involved in the French-language revival of La fanciulla del West by Puccini, a work little represented in French-speaking countries at the time. He also appeared at major summer festivals, particularly at the Chor√©gies d'Orange and the Arena of N√Æmes in the role of Jean in H√©rodiade.

Traumatic root fracture occurs most often in the middle third of the roots of fully erupted and fully formed teeth. However, root treated teeth are more susceptible to root fracture, as this involves removing root dentine, thereby weakening the tooth. Objectives of the treatment is to reposition the coronal fragments to allow revascularisation of the tooth, therefore maintaining aesthetics and functional integrity.  Vertical root fracture  Vertical Root Fractures are longitudinally orientated fractures of the root. They extend from the root canal to the periodontium. They are usually seen in root filled teeth, however they can also seen in non-restored teeth. The fractures can involve the whole length of the root or only a section of it. When un- recognised they lead to frustration and inappropriate endodontic therapy. The time between a root filling and a fracture is around 39 months, but they can occur during the treatment. Diagnosis is tricky as there as signs and symptoms are frequently delayed and no single clinical feature indicates a root fracture is present. = Signs and symptoms = They often present with discomfort/soreness which may be associated with an infection. Pain is usually mild to moderate in its intensity. Patients may also report a pain on biting. Another characteristic feature is the repetitive and frequent dislodgement of an apparently well-fitting post. = Predisposing factors = * Root Canal Anatomy: Roots narrower in mesio-distal dimension are more susceptible to fracture. * Dentin Characteristics: Dentine of pulpless teeth is stiffer and more susceptible to fracture * Corrosion: Corrosion of pins and posts can contribute * Use of a spreader: The wedging effect of the spreader during lateral condensation can lead to it. = Treatment = A clinician should remember that whilst a root fracture remains, bone around the tooth is continuing to be lost, compromising the success of any future potential implants. Anterior teeth with a vertical root fracture have a very poor prognosis and treatment is mainly extraction. Multi-rooted teeth can be successfully treated by removing the fractured root, either by root amputation or hemisection.  Horizontal root fracture  Horizontal root fracture is when the fracture line is perpendicular or oblique to the long axis of the tooth. It can occur in the apical, middle or coronal portion of the root. Horizontal root fracture accounts for only 3% of all dental injuries. = Detection = Horizontal root fractures can often be identified by taking a peri-apical radiograph. Now, with the introduction of cone beam computed tomography (CBCT), it is possible to view root fractures three-dimensionally. = Treatment = The treatment of horizontally root-fractured teeth involves re-positioning, stabilisation and occlusion adjustment, with a good chance of survival. The exception to this is when the horizontal fracture affects the coronal third of the root, in which case extraction is necessary in 80% of cases. In this case of pulpal necrosis, which occurs in 20-44% of root fracture cases, this can be treated through root canal treatment or endodontic surgery. When the coronal fragment of the tooth is stable, then splinting is unnecessary. However, in the case that the fracture affects the coronal third of the root, is in close-proximity to the cemento-enamel junction, and it is almost impossible to prevent the contents of the oral cavity contacting the fracture, then splinting for at least 2 months is required.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. History Eaton County was organized in 1837. Te county seat was originally at Bellevue, Michigan but in 1840 was moved to Charlotte. County offices were temporarily housed in the Eagle Hotel in Bellevue until 1845, when the first courthouse, a small frame structure, was constructed. By 1880, growth in the county had outstripped the capacity of the courthouse, and in 1882 the county decided to construct a new building. The committee in charge hired architects Miles, Cramer & Horn of Toledo, Ohio to design a new building, and contractors, also of Toledo, to construct it. The cornerstone was laid in 1883, and the building was completed in 1885. In 1895, a fire gutted much of the inside of the building, and the interior was reconstructed. The building was used by the county government until 1976 when a new county complex located one mile north of downtown Charlotte was constructed. Restoration of the courthouse began in the 1980s, and in 1993, the Courthouse Square Association took over the maintenance and care of the building and surrounding grounds. The upper two floors of the 1885 Courthouse are a public museum and rental venue. The ground floor contains office and retail spaces. Description The old Eaton County Courthouse is a three-story structure with a hip roof, with the first floor faced in rough fieldstone and the upper floors in red brick with stone accents. The entrances are approached via stairways to the second level. Entryways and windows on the second floor are in round-headed openings, while the windows on the third floor are in square-headed openings, save the windows in the center bay of each facade. Pavilions projects on the third level from each side of the building, with pediments and entablatures above-containing carving. In the center of the roof is a three-stage cupola with a square base, columned open belfry, and octagonal dome. A statue of justice tops the dome.

Biography  Escobedo studied architecture at the Universidad Iberoamericana and received a Master‚Äôs degree in Art, Design and the Public Domain at Harvard‚Äòs Graduate School of Design. Since 2007 she has been teaching at the Universidad Iberoamericana. She has participated as a judge for the Harvard Graduate School of Design, Boston Architectural College and the Monterrey Institute of Technology in Mexico. Escobedo has taught classes at Columbia University‚Äôs Graduate School of Architecture, Planning, and Preservation, Harvard Graduate School of Design, and the Architectural Association School of Architecture in London.  Early years  As a child Escobedo accompanied her father to the hospital where he worked as a doctor. The hospital is where she spent her time staring out the window at near by housing complexes. In an Interview with Architectural Digest, Escobedo says she was \\"trying to understand how space reflects people‚Äôs personalities,‚Äù by looking out the window. She reveals later in the interview that people's emotions and relationships are revealed by building's design.  Casa Negra  In 2003, with Alejandro Alarc√≥n, she founded the \\"Perro Rojo\\" studio, whose one of the most recognized works is \\"Casa Negra\\", which was designed in complete freedom by a person who wished to live surrounded by nature. The block structure is mounted on four tubes and lifted above the earth, and the rooms are located inside this structure. The design was finished with a large window to create total visibility of the City of Mexico, evoking the sensation of being behind a large camera.  Pavilion at the Museo Experimental el Eco  In 2010, her installation at the Museo Experimental el Eco featured moveable cement slabs intended to accommodate lectures and speakers.  Plaza C√≠vica, Lisbon and Victoria & Albert Museum  In 2013 she created a circular arena and in 2015 designed a series of mirrored complexes in the courtyard of the Victoria and Albert Museum. When creating, Escobedo illustrates her works within a general theme of time, but not in a historical context but rather in a social context.  Serpentine Pavilion  In 2018 Escobedo designed the Serpentine Pavilion for the London's Kensington Gardens. In her design she used materials and architectural styles from both Britain and Mexico in order to create a work that would capture the historical and cultural aspects of each country. The exhibit was open to the public from June 15 to October 7, 2018. The design of the Pavilion is an allusion to courtyards typically attached to houses in Mexico. The structure featured latticed walls of British made cement which allow both light and wind to pass through; the open, yet enclosed structure Escobedo designed is intended to create an illusion of secrecy. She also makes use of a small pool and a mirrored ceiling which creates a contrast between light and shadow that changes throughout the day as the sun moves angles, the shadows that shift resembles the passage of the day.

The film stars Sophie Cookson, Stephen Campbell Moore, Tom Hughes, Ben Miles, Nina Sosanya, Tereza Srbova and Judi Dench. Red Joan had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on 7 September 2018 and was released on 19 April 2019, by Lionsgate in the United Kingdom. The film is a dramatised inspiration on the story of Melita Norwood.  Premise  Red Joan is based on a novel of the same name written by Jennie Rooney, which was itself inspired by the life of Melita Norwood. Norwood worked at the British Non-Ferrous Metals Research Association as a secretary and supplied the Soviet Union with nuclear secrets. The materials that Norwood betrayed to the USSR hastened the pace at which the Soviets developed nuclear bomb technology. Cookson is the young Joan Smith studying physics at Cambridge. She became involved with Communists and radical politics through her friend Sonya (Tereza Srbova) and Leo Galich (Tom Hughes), a German Jew. Her story, which reaches as far back as 1938, is recalled in flashbacks as Joan in old age is questioned by the Special Branch. The questioning reveals that Joan was not actively supporting communism, but was more concerned about \\"levelling the playing field\\" to maintain peace in the post-World War II world. CastProduction The film stars Judi Dench and Sophie Cookson, and is directed by Trevor Nunn. David Parfitt is the producer, and the screenplay is by Lindsay Shapero. Release The film had its world premi√®re at the Toronto International Film Festival on 7 September 2018. Shortly after, IFC Films acquired U.S. distribution rights to the film. It was released in the United States and in the United Kingdom on 19 April 2019. =Box office= Red Joan grossed $1.6 million in the United States and Canada and $8.2 million in other countries for a worldwide total of $9.8 million. =Critical response= On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 30%, based on 132 reviews, with an average rating of 4.96/10. The site's critics consensus reads, \\"A fascinating real-life story dramatized in perplexingly dull fashion, Red Joan wastes its tale's incredible intrigue ‚Äì as well as the formidable talents of Judi Dench.\\" Metacritic reports a normalized score of 45 out of 100, based on 22 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". A review in The Guardian said that the film \\"can't disguise its mediocrity\\", and that the film \\"squanders its greatest acting asset\\". A critic in The Telegraph agreed that \\"Judi Dench is wasted in this absurd portrayal...\\" History The film has a slight resemblance to the life of Melita Norwood, but there are many differences: * Melita studied Latin and Logic at the University College of Southampton, and dropped out. The film portrayed Joan as studying physics at Cambridge and gaining a first class degree. * From 1932, Melita worked as a secretary with the British Non-Ferrous Metals Research Association, long before the war started. Much of the work done by the BNF during the 1939‚Äì45 period was of vital use for the defence industry, and included solving many of the corrosion problems of seawater- cooled systems in ships. No work was ever carried out on active materials for nuclear weapons. As secretary to a GI Bailey, the Research Superintendent, she had access to the papers prepared at the BNF for presentation to the research committees and some contractors. Some of these she chose to copy to Russian intelligence. This information was made use of by them and did occasionally result in one of their research organisations publishing development work on non-ferrous metals similar to and sooner than the BNF in Britain. Bailey was on an advisory committee to Tube Alloys. According to Jeremy Bernstein, Bailey was \\"warned about Norwood‚Äôs political associations and was careful not to reveal anything to her.\\"10 May 2019 \\"Incredible Untrue Events\\" Jeremy Bernstein, London Review of Books * Towards the end of 1935, she married Hilary Nussbaum who was of Russian descent (he later changed his name to Norwood), a chemistry teacher, lifelong communist. In 1936, Melita Norwood joined the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB). The film portrays Joan as being single during war. * Norwood‚Äôs NKVD espionage career began in the mid-1930s as a member of the Woolwich Spy ring in London. Three of its members were arrested in January 1938 but Melita Norwood was not then detained. She was thus spying long before the war, not after the use of the bomb at Hiroshima as shown in the film. * The film suggests that she proposed the use of centrifuges to separate the uranium isotopes. This technique was actually proposed in 1919 and accomplished by Jesse Beams in 1934 long before any atomic bomb project. * KGB archivist Vasili Mitrokhin defected with some KGB archives in 1992 and named Norwood as a highly important agent. However, some have questioned the validity of evidence from the Mitrokhin archive.

Dimitri Chandris was the eldest son of John D. Chandris, a prominent Greek shipowner.__FORCETOC__  Early life  Dimitri Chandris was born in Chios to a wealthy family, son of Ioannis D. Chandris, a prominent ship-owner, and his wife Evgenia. In 1915, John Chandris had purchased his first ship, the S/S Dimitrios, and founded Chandris. Following the outbreak of World War II, Dimitri Chandris relocated from Chios to London with his family, joining a large number of other ship-owning families from Greece. All of his ships were requisitioned by the UK government to assist in the war effort.  Post War  At the end of the war, Dimitri set about reconstructing the family business almost from scratch. He had no alternative but to remain in the U.K. because, although the war might have ended in Europe, Greece became embroiled in a civil war. Greek shipowners, therefore, elected to operate in either of the then two great maritime centres of London and New York. In 1950, he was elected on to the Board of the Union of Greek Shipowners. He also served as their vice president from 1960 to 1964. (His brother Anthony later served as the president). During the 1960s and 1970s, he was very active with various business interests in Greece including the establishment of the Alpha beer brewery (which became the second largest in Greece), a large motor franchise based on Rootes cars and a substantial hotel group. He was also involved in several charities including establishment of the School of Maritime Engineering in his home island of Chios.  Shipping career  Prior to the outbreak of World War II, Chandris operated six vessels: the passenger ships Dimitrios, Chimara and Corte II, and the steamers Dimitrios II, Vlassios and Eugenia. In the years following 1945, Dimitri and Anthony Chandris began to develop Chandris into the largest Greek passenger shipping firm. In 1945, Dimitri Chandris led the acquisition of Charlton Steam Shipping Company Ltd., which operated a fleet of passenger vessels from headquarters in Newcastle. This purchase signalled the beginning of the Chandris Group‚Äôs concentrated expansion efforts around passenger travel. Recognising the urgent need to provide passenger ships for displaced peoples and refugees in post-War Europe, the Chandris Group purchased the Prince David and Prince Robert (pictured right) from the Canadian Royal Navy in 1945. Following rebuilding and conversion, the new vessels were leased by the Chandris Group to the International Refugee Organisation. More intensive expansion efforts were undertaken from 1959, after which the Chandris Group acquired several large passenger ships, notably the RMS Bloemfontein Castle, the Bretagne, and the SS Lurline (later renamed the Ellinis).  Chandris Line  In 1950, Dimitri Chandris was elected on to the Board of the Union of Greek Shipowners (UGS), later serving as the organisation‚Äôs Vice President from 1960-1964. By the 1970s, the Chandris Group had developed multifarious activities moving into tankers and tramp ships as well as passenger and cruise ships. By 1976, Chandris had the largest passenger-cruise ship fleet in the world, surpassing the records held by major companies such as Cunard and Union-Castle. An editorial feature in Lloyd‚Äôs Review praised the recovery and renaissance of the Greek shipping sector, led by companies and individuals from Chios, writing: ‚ÄúIt is not surprising, therefore, that a name often mentioned with Greek shipping ‚Äì Chandris ‚Äì was born in Chios. Nor is it surprising that the most successful passenger ship operator in modern times should be Chandris.‚Äù  Death  Having been resident in London since World War II, Dimitri Chandris returned permanently to Greece in July 1980 to work and focus on the hotel group he established. Shortly following his return to Greece, Dimitri was involved in a boating accident. He was transferred to The London Clinic for medical care but died following an operation. Dimitri was buried in the Chandris family chapel next to the church of Agios Vlasios in Kambos, Chios.  Other Ventures  Outside of shipping, Dimitri Chandris was involved in a number of other business ventures, establishing a large automotive franchise, a brewery and a substantial hotel group.

Chay use geographic variation in the reduction of air pollution due to the 1981-82 recession to estimate the impact of air pollution on infant mortality in the U.S.; they find that reducing TSPs by 1% results in a 0.35% decline in the county-level mortality rate of infants, with most of the reduction concerning newborn deaths, in particular among Afro Americans.Chay, K., Greenstone, M. (2003). The Impact of Air Pollution on Infant Mortality: Evidence from Geographic Variation in Pollution Shocks Induced by a Recession. Quarterly Journal of Economics, 118(3), pp. 1121-1167. In another study with Chay, Greenstone exploits the impact of the U.S. 1970 and 1977 amendments to the Clean Air Act, which set a federal ceiling for total suspended particulates (TSPs), empowered the newly created Environmental Protection Agency to designate \\"non-attainment\\" counties in excess of that ceiling, and to impose strict air quality regulations on polluters in such counties, on housing prices, to study the relationship between housing prices and air quality. They find that the legislation was effective in reducing TSP air pollution and, based on an elasticity of housing values with regard to TSP concentration ranging from -0.20 to -0.35, that the improvements in air quality between 1970 and 1980 attributable to the regulations imposed under the non-attainment designation caused an increase of housing values in non- attainment counties worth $45 billion.Chay, K.Y., Greenstone, M. (2005). Does Air Quality Matter? Evidence from the Housing Market. Journal of Political Economy, 113(2), pp. 376-424. However, Greenstone also finds that the Clean Air Act's non-attainment designation probably played only a minor role in the 80% reduction of sulfur dioxide (SO2) concentrations in the United States, possibly because regulators assigned the SO2 non-attainment designation to many counties that hadn't even exceeded SO2 ceilings for a single day and consequently didn't impose excessively strict regulatory oversight.Greenstone, M. (2004). Did the Clean Air Act cause the remarkable decline in sulfur dioxide concentrations? Journal of Environmental Economics and Management, 47(3), pp. 585-611. Finally, Greenstone also analysed the impact of the 1970 and 1977 Clean Air Act Amendments on industrial activity in the U.S. and found that pollution-intensive in \\"non-attainment\\" counties lost ca. 590,000 jobs, $37 billion in capital stock, and $75 billion (at 1987 U.S. dollars) of output over 1972-87 as a consequence of the greater regulatory oversight exercised by EPA.Greenstone, M.

Journal of Political Economy, 110(6), pp. 1175-1219. = Economic effects of climate change= Together with Olivier Desch√™nes, Michael Greenstone initially found that climate change will increase agricultural profits in the U.S. over 2010-2100 by an average of $1.3 billion per year (in 2002 U.S. dollars) and that the measurement of climate change effects on land prices (the hedonic approach) is extremely sensitive to seemingly minor choices about control variables, sample, and weighting.Desch√™nes, O., Greenstone, M.

Desch√™nes and Greenstone subsequently re-estimated climate change to decrease U.S. agricultural profits by $4.5 billion per year over 2010-2100.Desch√™nes, O., Greenstone, M. (2012). The Economic Impacts of Climate Change: Evidence from Agricultural Output and Random Fluctuations in Weather: Reply. American Economic Review, 102(7), pp. 3761-3773. In another collaboration, Greenstone and Desch√™nes study the relationship between climate change and mortality and its mitigation through adaptation, and estimate that under \\"business-as-usual\\" scenarios climate change will increase the age- adjusted mortality rate in the U.S. by 3% by the end of the 21st century, though this effect may be strongly mitigated through populations adapting to the expected increase in the frequency of extreme temperature days.Desch√™nes, O., Greenstone, M. (2011). Climate Change, Mortality, and Adaptation: Evidence from Annual Fluctuations in Weather in the US. American Economic Journal: Applied Economics, 3(4), pp. 152-185. = Environmental and energy economics= Together with Hunt Allcott, Greenstone reconsiders the evidence in favour of an energy efficiency gap, i.e. whether consumers and firms fail to invest as much into energy efficiency as the expected increases in terms of utility or profits due to such investments would warrant. Overall, they cannot substantiate claims of a widespread energy efficiency gap, though their differentiation of specific investment inefficiency types leads them to conclude that policies aimed at addressing a supposed energy efficiency gap must be targeted to those consumer subject to investment inefficiencies if they are to be at all effective.Allcott, H., Greenstone, M. (2012). Is There an Energy Efficiency Gap? Journal of Economic Perspectives, 26(1), pp. 3-28. How much do people value the removal of hazardous waste? Investigating this question, Greenstone and Justin Gallagher use a regression discontinuity design to compare the reaction of housing market prices at hazardous waste sites that narrowly qualified to benefit from Superfund cleanups relative to those who narrowly missed qualifying. They find the reaction to be economically small and statistically insignificant, suggesting that the average local benefits of Superfund cleanups are likely to be much lower than the cleanups' average cost of $43 million.Greenstone, M., Gallagher, J. (2008). Does Hazardous Waste Matter? Evidence from the Housing Market and the Superfund Program. Quarterly Journal of Economics, 123(3), pp. 951-1003. In environmental economics as well as in other areas, Greenstone has strongly advocated for the greater application of (quasi-)experimental methods to identify which policies are effective and efficient in terms of increasing social welfare.Greenstone, M., Gayer, T. (2009). Quasi-experimental and experimental approaches to environmental economics. Journal of Environmental Economics and Management, 57(1), pp. 21-44. = Miscellany = How does the opening of a new manufacturing plant affect the productivity of incumbent manufacturing plants? Studying this question with Richard Hornbeck and Enrico Moretti, Greenstone finds that the TFP of incumbent plants in counties that were selected as the site for the opening of a new plant increase 12% more than in their runner-up competitors, with the agglomeration spillovers being particularly large if the old and new plants are similar. However, they also find that the wage growth in \\"winning\\" counties caused by the increased local labour demand tends to exceed productivity growth, thus reducing plant profits.Greenstone, M., Hornbeck, R., Moretti, E. (2010). Identifying Agglomeration Spillovers: Evidence from Winners and Losers of Large Plant Openings. Journal of Political Economy, 118(3), pp. 536-598. Exploiting the 1987 federal permission to U.S. states to only raise the speed limit on their rural interstates from 55 mph (ca. 90 kmh) to 65 mph (ca. 105 kmh), Greenstone and Orley Ashenfelter compare the time saved due to the increase in speed limit with the increase in fatality rates (an increase of ca. 35%) to estimate the value of a statistical life. They find that approximately 125,000 hours were saved per lost life, suggesting (if hours saved are valued at the average hourly wage) an upper bound of $1.54 million (in 1997 U.S. dollars) as a value of a statistical life.Ashenfelter, O., Greenstone, M. (2004). Using Mandated Speed Limits to Measure the Value of a Statistical Life. Journal of Political Economy, 112(1), pp. 226-267. Finally, Greenstone, Paul Oyer and Annette Vissing-Jorgensen use the extension of mandatory disclosure requirements under the 1964 Securities Acts Amendments from listed stock to over the counter (OTC) stock trades on stock returns. They find that the announcement of compliance with disclosure requirements by those OTC firms most likely to be affected by the change in regulation was accompanied by abnormal excess stock returns of ca. 3.5% in the weeks surrounding the announcement and that expectations regarding the extension of regulations resulted in abnormal excess returns ranging from 11.5 to 22.1% in the period between legislative proposal and enforcement, suggesting large-scale insider trading at OTC firms.Greenstone, M., Oyer, P., Vissing-Jorgensen, A. (2006). Mandated Disclosure, Stock Returns, and the 1964 Securities Act Amendments. Quarterly Journal of Economics, 121(2), pp. 399-460.

It consists of a series of waveguides and feed horns arranged in front of a shaped reflector, each one positioned to reflect the beam in a different direction. The wave guides meet at a central point where a small rotating waveguide feeds the microwave signal into each of the horns in turn as it rotates past them. The system was found in a number of 1950s and 60's era radars, notably the US's AN/FPS-50 radar used in the BMEWS network, and the High Speed Aerial of the UK's RX12874 Passive Detection System. The concept fell from use with the increasing use of passive electronically scanned array, which provided a similar steering mechanism in purely electronic form with no moving parts.

He was the eldest of a family of 13 children. While he was still young, around 1802, his parents moved to Rochdale in Lancashire. Daniel Harrison of Edgworth was admitted to Ackworth School in 1807. Harrison became a Liverpool coffee dealer. He married in 1823, at which time he was living in Everton, Liverpool. He is later recorded as being in business in Liverpool before 1825. A partnership between Daniel Harrison and Joseph Ecroyd of Liverpool, as coffee dealers, was dissolved in 1834. He was for a time in a partnership with Octavius Waterhouse, as wholesale tea and coffee dealers. After losses, caused by an investment by Waterhouse, it was dissolved in 1840. Harrisons & Crosfield With his brother Smith Harrison (born 1818), and Joseph Crosfield, Daniel founded Harrisons & Crosfield in Liverpool, in 1844.

From the early days, Smith Harrison attended the tea sales in London's Mincing Lane. In Liverpool, the company did business at 6 Temple Place. In 1855, the company migrated to London, which had become the destination of the tea clippers. The business had prospered from the start, and became one of the top dealers in tea. The premises were at 3 Great Tower Street. One of Harrison's sons, and two of Joseph Crosfield's sons, in time became directors. Marshalls in Romford was leased as the family home, after the move.

History The community was initially called ‚ÄúMoracoba‚Äù; a name that was birthed from a combination of two Arawak words; ‚ÄòMora‚Äô meaning tree and ‚ÄòCoba‚Äô meaning stump. However, several decades ago the name was officially changed to ‚ÄòMoraikobai‚Äô. The village is situated approximately from the confluence of the Mahaicony River, and is only accessible by the Mahaicony creek, helicopter, and trail, the latter of which can be treacherous given that it is of sand; it connects the village to Linden in Region 10 and consists of a population of just over five hundred residents, who are predominantly indigenous peoples from the Arawak tribe. Dorothy Patoir is said to be the first individual born in the village when it was established many decades ago. Presently, the village is led by a Toshao (Indigenous leader). Geography The geographical construct of the village is relatively large, naturally fertile, and mostly unoccupied, and therefore provides opportunities for potential agriculture and forestry enterprises. Features Moraikobai has a rich religious heritage, and its people endorse the Christian religion to a large extent. In this respect, the village consists of three churches including an Anglican church which was established when the community was first inaugurated as a mission. It follows that in the early days the village was known as St. Francis Mission and later, St. Francis District. Moraikobai is also known for its huge benab and exquisite handicraft produced by its skilled residents. Moraikobai is supported by a health centre, nursery and primary schools and a guest house, which is funded by the Regional Democratic Council (RDC) of region 5.

Having held numerous other posts, he became Financial Commissioner of the same province in 1936 and retired from the ICS in 1940. Thereafter, he was engaged in various roles, including as chairman of the Horace Plunkett Foundation, and was for some time head of the BBC India Section. Recognised as something of a maverick in comparison to most of his colleagues in India, Darling sought to improve the life of rural villagers and was an expert on the subject of peasant agriculture. He wrote several books, including some that are considered to be classic studies and which have been republished with introductions from academic writers in the 21st century.  Early life  Malcolm Lyall Darling was born on 10 December 1880 into a wealthy literary family. His parents were the Reverend Thomas Darling, the Rector of the church of St Michael Paternoster Royal in London, and Mildred, n√©e Ford, whose father, Richard, had been president of the Law Society of England and Wales. Alfred Comyn Lyall, who was an administrator in India and literary figure, was his uncle, guardian and a significant influence on his humanist education. He was educated at Eton College and King's College, Cambridge, prior to joining the ICS in 1904 after sitting the competitive examination.  Career summary  Appointed as an Assistant Commissioner, Darling was initially posted to the Punjab. He was a subdivisional officer in Rajanpur in 1906 and then from 1907 was tutor and guardian to the Raja of Dewas State (Senior), Tukojirao III. Darling later wrote about these early years in his book Apprentice to Power, in which it is apparent that his appointment as tutor and guardian to the 19-year old was a stroke of luck that significantly affected his future activities in the country. He learned as much, if not more, from the raja than he taught. It was while acting as tutor that he invited E. M. Forster to India, with whom he had been friends at college in Cambridge. While in Dewas, Forster wrote The Hill of Devi, which he dedicated to Darling, and his stay also inspired much of A Passage to India. Forster noted in the former that Dewas Somewhat in contradiction to this, Lynn Zastougil sees Darling as preferring Indian society to that of the \\"conservative, racist opinions\\" that prevailed in the ICS precisely because of his humanist upbringing, and says that he subsequently became disenchanted with the behaviour of his royal charge. In 1911, Darling was appointed as an undersecretary in the Political Department before moving to Sirsa in 1913 as a subdivisional officer. He joined the Co-operative Department as an assistant registrar in 1916, working with the new rural co-operative credit movement, and became registrar of co-operative societies in 1927. In 1930, Darling was appointed to chair a commission of inquiry ‚Äî the Punjab Banking Inquiry Committee ‚Äî following a series of banking failures in the province. He became a commissioner in Rawalpindi in 1931 and in 1935 was put on special duties with the Government of India to report on the co-operative movement. He was Finance Commissioner of the Punjab between 1936‚Äì1939, and acted as chairman of the Punjab Land Revenue Board in 1938. He was twice appointed vice-chancellor of the University of the Punjab, in 1931 and 1937, and in 1934 spent some time in Burma investigating co-operative farming movements. Upon his retirement from the ICS in 1940, Darling headed the Indian Section of the BBC Eastern Service between 1940-1944, where he worked with both Forster and George Orwell. In 1947 he became chairman of the Horace Plunkett Foundation, which was involved with agricultural co-operation, and between 1951-1960 he was involved with missions to Egypt, Greece, India, Pakistan and Yugoslavia.  Work in India  Darling, who has been described as a pioneer of community development, was not typical of the ICS administrators in Punjab during his time. A variety of changes, such as understaffing by financial pressures after the World War and an increasing preference by talented people to seek opportunities in Britain rather than abroad, together with political changes in Delhi and London, meant that, according to historian Christopher Harding, \\"most civil servants in Punjab [were] striving simply to hold the provincial administration together and [were] generally cynical of any grand plans that harked back to the \\"good old days\\" of the early Punjab administrators\\". That was not the case with Darling. Tensions were high because the British authorities were desperately trying to stem the tide of nationalism with piecemeal reforms, and communal disputes between Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs were increasing. In the toxic environment, where the authorities were almost entirely concerned with maintaining law and order, Darling and a colleague, Frank Lugard Brayne, stood out as mavericks for their attempts to improve the conditions in rural villages. In Darling's case, he was affected by the knowledge of the debt burden that was carried by many peasant farmers, some of whom owed more than 20 times their annual incomes. He believed that the perceived necessity of holding elaborate and expensive celebrations for life events such as birth, circumcision, marriage and death lay at the heart of the indebtedness. Debt was also affected by matters of prestige such as land ownership itself, which caused people to buy tracts that were uneconomic, and the role of Bania moneylenders, who also acted as agents for the payment of taxes and often dealt with those matters, without reference to the peasant. A cycle of increasing debt resulted from heavy interest payments on existing debt, which forced the cash-poor peasant to take on even more debt. The more prosperous the peasant was, the more credit-worthy they were and so the more debt they accrued. Darling thought that moneylenders were exploiting the situation and that the peasants were particularly exposed to problems should they suffer some natural or personal calamity, with debts sometimes doubling within a space of five years because of interest charges and families potentially being faced with repayments over several generations. He want to expand the co-operative credit facilities to improve the situation as well as to set up courts for arbitration and to introduce measures to increase prosperity without recourse to debt, such as animal breeding centres. He estimated that the number of moneylenders and dependants in Punjab had quadrupled between 1868 and 1911, and the decline in prices for agricultural produce that followed the end of World War I made the repayment of debt even more difficult. He noted that the moneylenders were generally Hindus and the peasants were mostly Muslim, a situation that prevailed despite the intent of the Punjab Land Alienation Act, 1901. His attitude to the moneylenders was not, however, entirely negative: he recognised the significance of their accessibility and the historic good that they had brought to regional development. At the same time, he was criticising their usurious nature, which, he thought, was being implicitly accepted by the unwillingness of the Raj authorities to intervene. His 1925 book, The Punjab Peasant in Prosperity and Debt, is a classic work of research, analysis and prescription, which demonstrated, according to D. N. Dhanagare, that he was \\"far ahead of his time\\". It was while working with the Punjab Banking Inquiry Committee that Darling was able to persuade the introduction of co-operative credit in every village of the province. In 1942, Darling noted that the Raj simply pumping financial resources into Indian agriculture was not an optimal policy. He agreed with Bryce Burt that it was desirable to preserve the way of life while nonetheless encouraging technological progress, but he added that in India While the decline in agricultural prices following World War I was a factor in the debt problems that Darling saw and tried to alleviate, he noted later that it was the rise in those prices during World War II that finally put an end to the necessity of debt among the Punjabi peasantry. He said that Darling tried always to befriend and understand the native population of India and spoke several of their languages. To that end, he made several long-distance tours of the country on horseback. One, in 1946‚Äì1947 began in Peshawar and ended, later, in Jubbulpore where he visited his friend Mahatma Gandhi. Believing in fair play, he found himself at odds with other British people in India when he denounced Dyer's massacre of civilians at Amritsar in 1919.http://www.thelongridersguild.com/historical%20members/Historical_D.htm  Recognition  Lyall was appointed as a Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire in 1934 and as a Knight Commander of the same order in 1939. Having held an Exhibition while a student at King's College, he was elected as an Honorary Fellow of the college in 1957.  Family  Darling married Jessica, daughter of Alexander Low, Lord Low of the Laws, Berwickshire in 1909. The couple had a daughter and two sons. Jessica died in 1932 around the time that Darling was commissioner in Rawalpindi. Darling died on 1 January 1969, aged 88.  Publications  Darling wrote several official reports, including: *Report on Certain Aspects of Co-operative Movement in India *Report on Labour Conditions in Agriculture in Pakistan (1955), for the Government of Pakistan In addition, Darling wrote several books among them some \\"classic works on the Punjab peasantry\\", in the opinion of Indivar Kamtekar. Some of these have been republished by Oxford University Press in the 21st century with introductions by academic writers.

Released on 30 October 1937, it became a commercial success, but no print of the film is known to survive, making it a lost film.  Plot  Mohini is a young girl whose father dies, leaving her and her male servant homeless. Her wily uncle unfairly takes her property. In their wanderings, Mohini and the servant come across Minnalkodi, a dacoit, and protect him from the police. The injured Minnalkodi declares Mohini the leader of his gang and dies. Mohini goes about in the guise of a man as Minnalkodi and kills her uncle and others who had harmed her earlier, but she is a good thief who robs the rich only to help the poor. Jayakumar, a police inspector, tries to capture her but is unable to make much progress. In the jungle, he comes across Mohini, without her disguise, and falls in love with her. When he learns that she is, in fact, Minnalkodi, he persuades her to change her ways, and they marry.  Production  Minnalkodi was among Tamil cinema's earliest action films, then known as \\"stunt films\\", and followed the Robin Hood concept of robbing the rich to help the poor. It was directed by K.

Koch resolved to survive, and then to thrive‚Äîfor himself, his teenage daughter, and his fianc√©e, whom he had married right before he underwent the surgery that took all or part of all of his four limbs, including his right leg and left hand.

One doctor in particular, a pioneering surgeon, recognized that Jonathan carried the mental and physical strength to successfully receive a human hand transplant. One year later, Koch made medical history when he received a revolutionary, first-of-its-kind, experimental sort of hand transplant. Usually it takes several years to learn how to use a new hand.

He used to be the lead guitarist for the band Warfaze. Later he introduced himself as a proficient solo singer. In 2019 he joined LRB as a lead vocalist.  Personal life  Balam was born on 24 Dececember 1975 in Jhigatola, Dhaka, Bangladesh. He is the first son of Quazi Jahangir Hafiz and Roxana Jahangir. His two elder brothers, Babar Jahangir and Bappy Jahangir, are in the United States. He has a younger sister, Julee. Balam is married to Shagufta Farook Sadia; they have a son, Fabiyanno Jahangir.https://www.last.fm/music/Balam/+wiki Career Balam started his career by forming the band Renegades after graduating from secondary school in 1995. He was the lead guitarist and main vocalist. The band published two albums - Onno Bhubon and Firiye Dao. Balam also worked as a guest artist in popular bands like ARK and Pentagon. Three years later, he joined Warfaze as the lead guitarist and the second vocalist. In 2002, Sunjoy and Babna had to leave the band due to their personal reasons. Balam got a promotion and became the lead vocalist. He produced hit singles like \\"Jadutare\\", \\"Nei Tumi\\", and \\"Somoy\\" as a part of the Band. Maharaj was another hit album during this phase; most of its songs were produced by him. Balam published his first featured album in 2005 which was Prem Shikari and made him prominent. In 2007, he left Warfaze and pursued a solo career. His debut solo album was self-titled and was a big hit both at home and abroad. He became a strong competitor of the then leading singer Habib Wahid. He continued with the successful albums Balam II and Balam III. During this period he also published two duet albums on which his sister Julee sang in his composition. After 2010, he took a break of three years as his wife Sadia was unwell. In 2013, his long-awaited fourth solo album Bhubon was released. However, as the whole country was unstable politically, this album couldn't get into the spotlight. Balam became disappointed as all his hard work had been in vain. He stopped working on new songs. Kaushik Hossain Taposh, the CEO of Gaanbangla Television inspired him to come back. Balam came back very strongly with his first HD music video \\"Meghey Dhaaka\\". It received a huge response, and he started working regularly. \\"Koto Je Khujechi Tomay\\" was another successful duet music video. In 2017, Balam published his fifth solo album, Golper Shohor, one of the most streamed albums on the Yonder music app. However, Yonder went bankrupt and suspended their services, which was shocking news to the Bangla music lovers. They came back but could not continue due to several reasons. At last Banglalink brought out another music app, VIBE, which got a number of popular artists including Balam, Habib, Shafin Ahmed, and Pritom Hassan to sign contracts. Being an ambassador, Balam published several songs like \\"Hothath\\", \\"Adore\\" and \\"Khola Akash\\", where he featured artists like Dilshad Nahar Kona and Anika Tasnim. \\"Hothath\\" was later republished as a music video and drew the attention of music enthusiasts. Now Balam is active in the music industry and publishes his new songs through this app. Besides singing, he has also acted on two TV dramas and hosted a number of TV programs. He has also started the record labels and production houses Zero Records and The Industry in association with Kaushik Hossain Taposh and Adit Rahman.

The site is guarded on all sides by higher hills. The ruins of Sch√∂necken Castle are also called Bella Costa or Clara Costa.

The present owner of the castle is the state of Rhineland-Palatinate.  Feud (1340‚Äì1350)  Less happy was a feud that Hartard had with Otto of Sch√∂nberg. According to this account, some of the lance bearers of the Lord of Sch√∂nberg went to Sch√∂necken to buy grain there, because there was none in the area of Sch√∂nberg at that time. Hartard ordered his men to chase Schonberg's men away. In order to avenge this abuse, Otto of Sch√∂nberg advanced on Sch√∂necken and besieged the castle. Hartard mocked him and called to him from the palace, saying, \\"I'm very pleased, Lord Otto, that you are paying me a visit\\", to which Otto replied, \\"The devil make you crawl in the dirt for a long time in order to punish you, my servants are not women, come out, and you'll taste the servants!\\" Hartard then sallied out, beat Sch√∂nberg's men and pursued them to Sch√∂nberg. At Sch√∂nberg, Otto sat down and received support from his subjects. After a violent fight, the Sch√∂necks fled and Hartard's son was beaten to death. The women of Sch√∂nberg are said to have torn his body into pieces and thrown it to the dogs. Otto followed the Sch√∂necks to Sch√∂necken where fighting broke out again. Otto and Hartard met and fought against each other. Otto split the Hartard's helmet and wounded him in the head, after which Hartard fled and threw himself into his castle, which Otto now besieged. Finally, Hartard was forced to buy the enemy's withdrawal with 100 guilders.  Description  The castle occupies a 120-metre-long rectangular site with an enceinte and three projecting towers. In the east the site is guarded by a wide neck ditch. The three towers stand on the south side, two of them being still three storeys high. The two round towers probably date to the 13th or 14th century, the central, rectangular one is more recent. All three towers and their curtain walls have been part of a multi-storey residential building since no later than the 16th century, as depicted in an 18th-century painting.

Laid out in the rural style, it was established in 1850 by Warren Delano II, the grandfather of Franklin Delano Roosevelt. History By the late 1840s Fairhaven's old burial ground, established in 1771 and later known as the Railroad Cemetery, could no longer accommodate the increasing population of the town which had become a center for shipping and the whale industry. In addition, the Fairhaven Branch Railroad was being planned which would require closing part of the old burial ground. Warren Delano II purchased 14 acres of farm land in 1847 which was destined for the building of a new cemetery and gifted it to the town of Fairhaven. The cemetery was consecrated on July 7, 1850 with 1000 people in attendance. The first burial there was Mary Evans Delano who had died at the age of 15. When the railway came to the town in the mid-1850s, half of the bodies in the Railroad Cemetery were moved to Riverside. Eventually, all the remaining bodies there were re- interred at Riverside. A sexton's cottage was built in 1881 and is one of the rare examples of the Eastlake architectural style in the area. Delano purchased a further five acres of farmland in 1889 to enlarge the cemetery. In 1893, Frances Mills was the first African-American to be buried there.Barboza, Robert (25 May 2017). \\"Cemetery tour highlights notables in Fairhaven history\\".The Advocate.

It is the third of his North Korean films after he and his wife Choi Eun-hee were abducted and brought to the country against their will. Choi stars in Salt as an unnamed mother who disapproves of her son after he runs away with guerrillas, but eventually comes to see them as fighting for a just cause. The film is set in 1930s Kando (Jiandao) where ethnic Koreans are persecuted by the Chinese and Japanese. The film employed a new virtue in North Korean cinema of short and condensed stories instead of multi-part epics. Unusual for a North Korean film, it was favorably reviewed by foreign critics. Choi's performance in particular is praised for realism. She was awarded the Best Actress prize at the 14th Moscow Film Festival in 1985 for her role.  Plot  The film opens with \\"You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again?\\" (Matthew 5:13) The film opens with a quote from the Bible (for the first time in the history of North Korean cinema where only quotations from Kim Il-sung were typical): \\"You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again?\\" (Matthew 5:13). The setting of the film is Kando (Jiandao) in the 1930s, torn apart by ethnic conflict in which the Koreans are \\"literally caught in the crossfire\\" of Japanese occupiers, Chinese bandits, and communist guerrillas. The local policing force is supposed to protect the peasants, but in truth only works when the interests of the Japanese occupiers are at stake. The protagonist is an anonymous mother whose husband is killed by bandits. Her son Pong Shik runs off with a band of guerrillas, and her other children fall ill and are denied care by a doctor. The youngest of her sons was born after she was raped by a Chinese landlord, in a scene described as the darkest in the film. After a failed abortion attempt, the mother tries to suffocate the unwanted child before finally deciding to hang herself. However, her neighbor comes to her rescue, cutting the noose just as she is about to commit suicide. The neighbor, although poor, gives the mother's family some salt and suggests it as an opportunity to help leviate her plight. At the end of the film, the mother carries an expensive sack of salt on a mountain trail with other smugglers. They are attacked by bandits, who in turn are chased away by the communist guerrillas. The guerrillas vow to protect the common people and the mother realizes that her son did not run away from his family with bad intent, but was in fact a hero. She is now determined to find her son and follow the guerrillas.  Production  Shin directed Salt in 1985, following his second North Korean film, Runaway (1984). Like Runway, Salt was produced by Shin's North Korean company Shin Film. Salt was released in 1985, the same year that he directed Pulgasari and saw the release of his film The Tale of Shim Chong. Salt is based on a 1934 novel of the same name by Kang Kyeong-ae set in Kando (Jiandao). Like Runaway, Salt is a film in the \\"juche Socialist realist standard\\" of North Korean film. In Salt, however, the suffering of the poor people is even more ruthlessly portrayed. In a socialist realist fashion, the landowning and rich classes is displayed as devoid of morals, with the landowner committing rape and the doctor refusing care. The poor, in turn, are generous and their relations filled with solidarity. Another dimension of conflict is between the Koreans, portrayed as innocent, and the Chinese. Like Runaway, the film embodies a tension between Shin's desire for what is good cinema and the political motives it had to serve. Choi Eun-hee stars in the film as the unnamed mother. Choi's character speaks in the dialect of the northern part of the country, instead of the usual Pyongyang dialect, which broke the customs of North Korean cinema. Choi is often on camera in \\"patient\\", even \\"torturous\\" shots. Her performance was \\"unprecedented in North Korean cinema history for its naturalism and nuance\\". Anna Broinowski goes so far as to say that \\"the suffering [of Choi] depicted on screen was real\\". A tragedy in the social realist genre, Salt is \\"full of sex and eroticism\\". It includes a scene of Choi breastfeeding with frontal nudity, as well as a rape scene. A North Korean defector has testified to remembering going to watch the film several times with friends for the rape scene that exposes the mother's milky thigh \\"just to see that brief white flash of flesh\\". In addition to Shin's contribution as the director, the success of Salt is also attributable to a conscious change of policy in North Korean film making. While typically North Korean films were bland multi-part productions with up to 20 films in a series, it was decided that films should be more condense, realistic, and lyrical; the way Salt ended up being made.  Reception  Foreign critics reviewed the film favorably, which was unusual for a North Korean film. Leonid Petrov calls it a \\"masterpiece\\". Johannes Sch√∂nherr, author of North Korean Cinema: A History writes: \\"Salt [is] an extraordinary piece of cinema. It feels like 1970 exploitation meeting socialist-realist art\\". Shin and Choi were allowed to travel to the 14th Moscow Film Festival in 1985, where Choi won the Best Actress award for her role. It is the highest honor a North Korean film has received to date. Kim Il-sung praised the film for its \\"commitment to realism\\". Many North Korean defectors have reportedly approached Choi, thanking for her role in Salt. Salt was included in a retrospective of Shin's filmography at the Busan International Film Festival in South Korea 2001. A South Korean catalog of female directors mistakenly attributes the film's direction to Choi, who however had already stopped directing when the film was made and was focusing on acting.

In 1884, he moved to Olivet, supposedly so that his children could attend Olivet College. Once in Olivet, he became involved in the manufacture of boots and shoes, and constructed this house for his family. The house was acquired by Olivet College in 1934. The College used it variously as the president's residence, a fraternity house, a dormitory, a faculty residence, and as the location of the art department and studios. By 1971, the house was vacant. It remained vacant until at least the 1980s, but the college eventually restored the house, and it serves as the president's residence.

She was a very good performer as a juvenile in 1902 when she won the Sandown Produce Stakes and was placed in her other three starts. In the following year she failed in the Lincoln Handicap but the recorded a decisive win in the Oaks Stakes. She failed to win or place in four subsequent races and was retired from racing at the end of 1904. As a broodmare she produced a few winners but had her biggest impact on the future of Thoroughbred racing through her unraced daughter Lady Brilliant. Background Our Lassie was a bay mare bred in England by Jack Barnato Joel who also owned her during her racing career. She was trained by Joel's private trainer Charles Morton at Wantage in Berkshire. She was one of the best horses sired by Ayrshire who won the 2000 Guineas and Epsom Derby in 1888 and the Eclipse Stakes in 1889. Our Lassie's dam, Yours failed to win a race herself but produced several other winners including Your Majesty. Yours was a granddaughter of the influential British broodmare Grand Duchess. Racing career=1902: two-year-old season= Our Lassie made an early start to her racing career in the ¬£2,000 Sandown Park Produce Stakes over five furlongs on 24 April and won from the colts Rabelais and Arabi. In her three other races she finished second to Arabi in the Great Foal Plate at Lingfield Park, third to Fairman and Countermark in the Great Lancashire Breeders' Produce Stakes at Liverpool and second to Skyscraper in the Prince of Wales's Plate at York Racecourse in August. =1903: three-year- old season= Jack Joel, Our Lassie's owner and breeder In an unusual seasonal debut for a classic contender, Our Lassie was matched against older horses in the Lincoln Handicap over one mile on 27 March. Although the filly had been \\"off her food\\" for a few days before the race, Joel decided to run her as she was set to carry only 84 pounds and had already been backed to win ¬£100,000 from the bookmakers. In the event she ran poorly and finished unplaced behind the easy winner Over Norton. For her next race Our Lassie was moved up in distance for the 125th running of the Oaks Stakes over one and a half miles at Epsom Racecourse on 29 May. Hammerkop (July Stakes) started favourite ahead of Sun Rose, who had appeared to be an unlucky loser in the 1000 Guineas, with Our Lassie, ridden by Mornington Cannon, next in the betting on 6/1 in a ten runner field which also included Valve, Dazzling and Skyscraper (who had won the Cheveley Park Stakes since beating Our Lassie at York). The race was a rough one, with Dazzling being brought down after a collision with Sun Rose at Tattenham Corner, at which point the 33/1 outsider Ladies Mile led from Hammerkop with Our Lassie in third. Hammerkop went to the front in the straight but Our Lassie gained the advantage a quarter of a mile from the finish and drew away to win \\"easily\\" by three lengths from Hammerkop, with Skyscraper a head away in third place. Jack Joel reportedly won ¬£10,000 by backing his filly in a double bet with the Epsom Derby winner Rock Sand. A week after her Epsom victory, Our Lassie started 13/8 favourite under a weight of 106 pound for the Manchester Cup over one and a half miles but finished fourth of the eleven runners behind the colt Zinfandel. In September at Doncaster Racecourse Our Lassie was matched against the 1000 Guineas winner Quintessence in the Park Hill Stakes over fourteen and a half furlongs. Although she started the 7/4 favourite, she never looked likely to win and finished towards the rear of the six-runner field behind Quintessence. At Newmarket Racecourse in October she finished sixth to Sceptre in the Duke of York's Stakes. =1904: four-year-old season= Our Lassie remained in training as a four-year-old. On her first and only appearance of the season she started a 66/1 outsider for the Royal Hunt Cup at Royal Ascot in June and finished unplaced behind Csardas. She was retired from racing at the end of the year. Assessment and honours In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Our Lassie a \\"inferior\\" winner of the Oaks. Breeding record At the end of her racing career, Our Lassie became a broodmare for Joel's stud. She produced at least eight foals between 1906 and 1914: *Sweet Lassie, a bay filly, foaled in 1906, sired by Orme *Fair Lassie, bay filly, 1907, by Orme *Yetman, bay colt, 1908, by Persimmon *Perilla, chestnut filly, 1910, by Polymelus *Parhelion, chestnut colt, 1911, by Sundridge.

He worked in Hungary, Italy, Germany, Austria, England and the United States and did important work on the development of Hungary's electricity network after World War I. Biography He attended the Pestian Graduate Grammar School and then earned a mechanical engineering diploma at the Royal J√≥zsef University in 1906. After completing his university years, he spent a short time working in Germany and England. He then obtained employment at the Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company in Pittsburgh, USA. Here he worked as a workshop trainee for two years and as a group leader for another two years. He participated in the training organized by the factory. After completing this, in 1909 he passed an examination and obtained an electrical engineering diploma. For a short time he worked at the factory's design department and then returned to Europe. From 1910 to 1911, he was assistant professor at the Technical University of Karlsruhe, working with Professor Arnold. In addition to teaching, he participated in the first university degree in electrical engineering in Europe. In 1911, he returned to Hungary and became an engineer at the Ganz Works. On 22 June 1912, he married in Budapest. He also contacted K√°lm√°n Kand√≥, who was head of the Societe Italiana Westinghouse electric locomotive factory in Italy. Kand√≥ invited him to Italy and entrusted him with the factory's billing and planning office. In 1913 Vereb√©l√ø moved to Vado Ligure with his family and participated in the planning and production of the two most successful Kand√≥ locomotives for express trains. After World War I From 1917 to 1918, he was posted to the railway division of Allgemeine Elektrizit√§ts Gesellschaft (AEG) in Vienna. He then returned to Hungary and, in 1918, he became head of the electrical department of the Hungarian State Railways (M√ÅV). He outlined his first study in 1919, in which the issue of railway expansion was examined in terms of national energy management. The idea was put into its final form in his 1923 study. This was based on the establishment of eight national power plants based on Hungary's coal assets, predominantly in Transdanubia. The western part of the country was favoured because the Treaty of Trianon had less truncated this area, the railway network remained unchanged, and most of the industry was settled there. The power plants to be built to the east of the Danube were designed to supply the industrial area near Miskolc and to create the electrical base of the Great Hungarian Plain. The study was based on the use of two coal-fired power plants in Miskolc and the use of the Pearl-Hatvan lignite field in Szolnok. The Esztergom coal basin supplied the Budapest power plant, while the Tatab√°nya and Dorog mines already supplied existing local electricity producers with fuel. The P√©cs√∫jhegy Power Plant was built to use coal from the Mecsek coalfields. World Energy Conference in 1924 K√°lm√°n Kand√≥, Ern≈ë Vilczek and L√°szl√≥ Vereb√©l√ø (right) at the 1924 World Energy Conference At the first World Energy Conference in 1924, Kand√≥ and Vereb√©l√ø introduced the Transdanubian electrification plan. As a first step, A 75 MW power station and a connecting 100 kV power line of 150‚Äì200 km were built and the Budapest-Hegyeshalom railway line was electrified. This raised the interest of English financial circles, and after long negotiations, they made an offer in 1926, some of which was guaranteed by the British Treasury. The offer was accepted in 1927 by Hungary and the Hungarian Transdanubian Electricity Company was established to manage it. In the meantime, Verebely and Kand√≥ prepared for railway expansion. Kand√≥'s idea of supplying the railway from the industrial-frequency (50 Hz) power system complemented Verebely's electricity management plans. Scientific and educational activity He was appointed as a public university professor at the Department of Electrotechnics (later Department of Electrical Engineering). From 1936 to 1937 he was dean of the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering and Chemical Engineering, and the following year the Chair of the Mechanical Engineering Department at the Faculty. After the World War II, he restored teaching at the faculty and lectures began in April, 1945. He was one of the first heads of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering in 1949. Meanwhile, he produced his four-volume work \\"Electric Power Transmission\\". He was greatly interested in the history of electrical engineering. In 1930 he drew world attention to the work of √Ånyos Jedlik (1800-1895) a Hungarian scientist, inventor and Benedictine monk. He was vice president of the Hungarian Association of Electrotechnics between 1935 and 1938 and, until 1941, he was chairman and later co-chairman. Final years He retired in 1957, after which he worked on publishing his books until his death in 1959. He was buried at the Farkasr√©ti Cemetery on 26 November 1959.

She wrote one of the major works on slavery and is one of the few scholars who have focused on black identity in the Dominican Republic. Widely recognized for her work, she has received the Pedro Henr√≠quez Ure√±a Gold Medal from the Government of the Dominican Republic, the International Jos√© Mart√≠ Prize from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the Order of Merit of Duarte, S√°nchez and Mella, among other honors. Early life Celsa Altagracia Albert Batista was born on 28 July 1942 in Guaymate, a batey in La Romana Province, Dominican Republic to Rosa Batista and Charles Albert. Her mother was Dominican, from Santiago de los Caballeros and her father, a Cocolo who migrated to the Dominican Republic from Saint Kitts and Nevis. Conditions in the batey were often deplorable and educational opportunities were limited. Though it was difficult, Albert completed her primary and secondary education, while working to help her family meet their basic needs after her father's death. Career In 1964 Albert began working as an elementary school teacher in a school she founded located in La Romana in her home province. The Escuela Nuestra Se√±ora de La Altagracia (Our Lady of Grace School) served student in the low-income areas, where she had grown up. She simultaneously pursued university studies, graduating magna cum laude with her bachelor's of education degree in 1977, from Pedro Henr√≠quez Ure√±a University. In 1979, she left teaching and moved to Mexico City to enroll in the National Autonomous University of Mexico () and further her education in the school's Latin American Studies program. Completing her master's degree with honors in 1983, Albert's master's thesis, The Educational Ideologies of Jos√© Mart√≠, was inspired by Jos√© Mart√≠'s writings on racism and their ethnic group. Her own experiences growing up as cocolo and the influence of studying Mart√≠, led her to focus on Afro-Dominican history as a focus for her scholarship. Albert returned to Santo Domingo and began working as curriculum director of social sciences for the Ministry of Education. Simultaneously, she joined the faculty of history at the Universidad Cat√≥lica Santo Domingo (UCSD) and continued to work in various posts in the education Ministry, such as serving as director to the Division of General Curriculum and Assessment and later director of culture. In 1987, she was appointed as chair of the history department at UCSD, becoming the dean of the College of Humanities in 1988. Albert became the vice rector of UCSD in 1989. She and other scholars began challenging the official history of the country, which omitted the contributions of the black population of the island, or if they were included, depicted those with African heritage as having lower-status, or subservient roles. Her first book, Los africanos y nuestra isla (Historia, cultura e identidad) (The Africans and our Island (History, Culture and Identity), was published in 1987. Two years later, she published Pulula: La poes√≠a como reflejo de la historia (Pulula: Poetry as a reflection of history) and followed it in 1990 with a landmark book, Mujer e esclavitud en Santo Domingo (Women and Slavery in Santo Domingo). Her treatment on enslaved women remains one of the \\"major works\\" written on bondage in the Dominican Republic. She coined the phrase cimarronaje dom√©stico (domestic wild animal), to refer to servant women who assisted fleeing slaves and challenged the notion that there was no history of active resistance from slaves in the country. The English word maroon, which refers to escaped slaves living independently in enclaves, derives from the Spanish word cimarr√≥n. Albert founded the Instituto Dominicano de Estudios Africanos y Asi√°ticos \\"Sebasti√°n Lemba\\" (Indeasel) (Sebasti√°n Lemba Dominican Institute for African and Asian Studies) in 1990. Serving as president and executive director of the organization, she simultaneously continued her work in the education Ministry and at UCSD. In 1992, Albert published two works, Las ideas educativas de Jos√© Mart√≠ (The educational ideas of Jos√© Mart√≠) and a short story La esclava Elena (The Slave Elena). Her publication on Mart√≠ led her to be awarded the International Jos√© Mart√≠ Prize by UNESCO in 1995, which was first established that year to commemorate the centennial of Mart√≠'s death. That same year, she was honored by the Ministry of Education with the Pedro Henr√≠quez Ure√±a Gold Medal. In 1996, on International Women's Day, Albert was honored with the Order of Merit of Duarte, S√°nchez and Mella. Albert returned to Mexico to attain her PhD in Latin American Studies from UNAM in 1997. She returned to the Dominican Republic and retiring from her government post, continued teaching history at UCSD. She simultaneously served as graduate coordinator for Caribbean history and geography and in the Division of Continuing education was appointed as the director of education and popular culture projects. Her short story La esclava Elena was adapted as a play, Juan Pablo Duarte y las mujeres en la independencia nacional (Juan Pablo Duarte and women in national independence) in 2012. Albert has lectured widely internationally on the African diaspora in Latin America. She continues to publish on the subject, with essays and texts like Rep√∫blica Dominicana: Primer Pa√≠s afrodescendiente de Am√©rica (Dominican Republic: First Afro-descendant Country in America, 2014) and Diversidad e identidad en Rep√∫blica Dominicana (Diversity and identity in the Dominican Republic, 2014). In 2013, a street at the Plaza de la Cultura in Santo Domingo was renamed in her honor.

Lucchino is a life sciences CEO and American entrepreneur known for his work in the biotechnology and medical technology sectors. He is co- founder, president and CEO of Frequency Therapeutics (Nasdaq:FREQ), a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing a novel approach to regenerative medicine to create and commercialize therapeutics for degenerative conditions including hearing loss and multiple sclerosis as well as treatments for other conditions, based on a unique approach to regenerative medicine.  Personal  A Pittsburgh native, Lucchino graduated in 1987 from Central Catholic High School. He is the son of Judge Frank Lucchino and is the nephew of former Boston Red Sox president Larry Lucchino. Lucchino holds an MBA degree from MIT Sloan School of Management as an Alfred P. Sloan Fellow. Lucchino also holds a Master of Science degree from Syracuse University and a Bachelor of Arts degree from Denison University. He is a former member of the Board of Governors for the Sloan Fellows program.  Career  Lucchino began his career as a technology marketing executive working for major advertising firms in New York City. Lucchino co-founded and served as managing director of LaunchCyte, an investment firm that specializes in developing biomedical intellectual property. He led corporate development activities and secured funding for the firm‚Äôs portfolio companies. He subsequently served as a senior associate at Polaris Venture Partners, a Boston-based venture capital firm active in life sciences and technology. In 2006, while earning his MBA at MIT's Sloan School of Management, Lucchino was selected by MIT Institute professor, entrepreneur and inventor Dr. Robert S. Langer to team up with Dr. Christopher Loose to advance an implant surface technology that prevents blood clotting and infection. Lucchino‚Äôs team went on to win entrepreneurial competitions (by beating more than 300 teams collectively) at MIT, Harvard and Oxford universities. He continued with the team as it transformed into the company, Semprus BioSciences and Lucchino became CEO of the firm. While Lucchino was CEO of Semprus the company grew from two to 50 employees, and achieved FDA clearance and CE Mark approval for its Sustain‚Ñ¢ Technology. He also secured $28.5 million in venture capital financing and $5.4 million in federal funding. The Semprus Sustain‚Ñ¢ Technology was featured in Science Translational Medicine in 2012. Semprus BioSciences was acquired by Teleflex Medical, Inc. (NYSE: TFX) for $80 million. After the sale, he continued to serve as a vice president for TeleFlex. Lucchino next became CEO of Entrega Bio, a firm launched by PureTech Health, a Boston medical discovery company that spins off many new firms. Lucchino oversaw the company's collaboration with GoogleX in the area of nanoparticle delivery, secured additional financing for Entrega, and served as Executive Entrepreneur in Residence at PureTech. Lucchino is the co-founder, CEO and president of Frequency Therapeutics since November 2014, first serving as chairman, and subsequently taking on the president and CEO roles alongside co-founders biomedical engineer Jeffrey Karp and Langer. Frequency is developing a form of regenerative medicine pioneered by Langer and Karp in which novel small molecules activate dormant progenitor cells within the body, enabling the restoration of function to damaged tissues. Frequency‚Äôs first therapeutic target is chronic, noise-induced hearing loss, in which the hair cells within the cochlea are damaged and die, leading to hearing loss. Frequency‚Äôs experimental treatment, FX-322, underwent a Phase 1 first-in-human safety trial in Australia in 2017. The company announced the trial had met all endpoints. In August 2018, the company initiated a Phase 1/2 trial of FX-322 in the US. The trial is intended to further assess the safety of FX-322 when administered intratympanically to adult patients with stable sensoineural hearing loss and who have a medical history consistent with either noise exposure or sudden hearing loss. Frequency has said it intends to apply its technology to skin, muscle and gastrointestinal disorders.  Activities  In March 2018, Lucchino began a two-year term as chairman of the Massachusetts Biotechnology Council. Lucchino earlier was an elected member of the Board of Directors of the Massachusetts Biotechnology Council. He is a Trustee of Mt. Auburn Hospital, a 200-bed Harvard Medical School facility. He also serves on the Audit Committee for CareGroup: the parent organization of Mt. Auburn, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and The New England Baptist Hospital. In 2013, Lucchino joined the board of the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation. He was a member of the Board of Directors of the Advanced Medical Technology Association (AdvaMed), the national trade association representing the US medical device industry, from 2010 to 2013. He also serves as a director of Lipella Pharmaceuticals Inc. Lucchino regularly appears on industry panels. He has been as a guest lecturer on entrepreneurship and innovation at colleges and universities including MIT (2007 through 2017); University of Pennsylvania Wharton School of Business (2010); Harvard Business School (2009 and 2010); Harvard Medical School (2010, 2011 and 2012); and the University of Pittsburgh (2012), where Lucchino delivered the Michael G. Wells Entrepreneurial Scholars Lecture as part of Translation Science 2012. He was selected by the Boston Business Journal as one of Boston‚Äôs ‚Äú40 under Forty‚Äù leading executives, has appeared as an industry commentator on WGBH-FM (NPR) ‚ÄúInnovation Hub,‚Äù and is a contributor to the WBUR-FM‚Äôs ‚ÄúCognoscenti‚Äù online forum, and the Boston Business Journal. Lucchino is active with the National Outdoor Leadership School (NOLS). He was part of a NOLS expedition that climbed Alaska‚Äôs Denali, spent 95 days living in the Rocky Mountains as part of a leadership training program, and rafted down Idaho‚Äôs ‚ÄúRiver of No Return,‚Äù the Salmon River. Lucchino was honored by NOLS as the recipient of the 2013 NOLS Alumni Service Award, ‚Äúgiven to a devoted [NOLS] alumnus who has served the school in exemplary ways as NOLS pursues its mission to teach leadership, conservation, and outdoor skills.‚Äù He has been on the NOLS advisory council since 2014. Lucchino has participated four times as part of the Boston Red Sox‚Äôs ‚ÄúTeam 9‚Äù in the annual Pan-Mass Challenge, the two-day, 190-mile cycling event that raises funds for adult and pediatric cancer care and research through The Jimmy Fund at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston.  Project Onramp  In January 2019, Lucchino announced the formation of Project Onramp, a program that matches low-income students attending four-year colleges in Massachusetts with paid internships at local biotechnology companies. The program, formed in collaboration with MassBio, the Massachusetts Life Sciences Center, Life Science Cares and Bottom Line, is intended to give disadvantaged students their start in life science careers, which is often difficult because companies do not publicize their summer internship programs. Project Onramp was developed to help students who are not enrolled in elite schools like MIT and Harvard get a start in the life sciences industry. Industry would benefit because life sciences companies often have longstanding problems with a lack of diversity in their workforces. In May 2019, Project Onramp announced it had matched 50 Massachusetts students with internships at life sciences companies.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. History In 1832, Isaac Crary first purchased the land on which he would later plat the village of Bellevue, choosing it in part for the easy access to water power. He soon constructed the first mill in Bellevue. In 1852, Manlius Mann, from Marshall, Michigan, purchased this plot of land. He hired builder Horatio Hall to construct this gristmill as well as a sawmill. Mann continued to run the mill until 1873, when he sold it to Hiram Ovenshire and Daniel D. Gardiner. In 1881, Ovenshire bought out his partner and became the sole proprietor. Ovenshire passed the mill down to his descendants, including A.G. Butler in 1923. The Butler family ran the mill until 1958, when mill operations ceased. After closure, the mill was used for grain storage until 1975. In 1977, the Stockhausen family purchased the property, restored the exterior, and renovated the interior for use as a private residence. The mill is occasionally open for tours. Description The Bellevue Gothic Mill is a three-and-one-half-story structure measuring 25 feet wide and 40 feet long, and sitting on a rubble foundation and with a gabled sheet metal roof. It is clad with a combination of tongue and groove siding and vertical board and batten siding. It is constructed from massive twelve by twelve walnut timbers and three by twelve floor joists.

Frederick began by assisting his father, but then trained in the law, and always called himself a solicitor.Census reports Gordon turned in his thirties to the promotion of elegant restaurants, hitherto not fully developed in Victorian London. With Horatio Davies, later owner of Pimm's and Lord Mayor of London he formed Messrs. Gordon and Company. Their first success came with the conversion in 1868 of the fifteenth-century Crosby Hall, Bishopsgate in the City of London into a fashionable eating place with an open layout in the vast Great Hall instead of the traditional boxes.{{cite book ref=harv He bought the Apollinaris mineral water business in 1897 from its founder Edward Steinkopff and his co-partners for nearly ¬£2,000,000, (very approximately ¬£2-4 billion in 2016). =Stanmore= Gordon is credited with developing Stanmore from a rural village to a London suburb. In 1890 he opened his own railway line, the Harrow and Stanmore Railway, to serve his luxury country hotel there, Bentley Priory. He also built a residential avenue of suburban houses in Stanmore, which he named Gordon Avenue, to attract wealthy Londoners to come to live in the country and commute into the city on his new railway. He also laid out Stanmore Golf Course. Neither the Bentley Priory Hotel nor the railway were commercially successful, and in 1899 he wound up the Harrow and Stanmore Railway and sold it outright to the LNWR for ¬£35,000. Gordon took up residence with his family at Bentley Priory. Death and legacy Frederick Gordon died on 22 March 1904 while staying at his Hotel Metropole in Cannes. His body was brought back to Britain and buried in the family grave at the church of St John the Evangelist, Great Stanmore. The Gordon Hotels chain continued after Frederick's death.

Tanenbaum made significant contributions in the fields of transistor development and semiconductor manufacturing. Although it was not made public at the time, he developed the first silicon transistor, demonstrating it on January 26, 1954 at Bell Labs. He also helped develop the first gas-diffused silicon transistor, which convinced Bell administrators to support the use of silicon over germanium in their transistor design. He later led a team that developed the first high-field superconducting magnets. Later in his career he became an executive. He dealt with the separation of Bell Laboratories and AT&T;, and became the first Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board at AT&T; Corporation as of January 1, 1984. Early life and education Morris Tanenbaum was born to Ruben Simon Tanenbaum and his wife Mollie Tanenbaum, on November 10, 1928, in Huntington, West Virginia. Tanenbaum's parents were Jewish, and had emigrated from Russia and Poland, first to Buenos Aires, Argentina and then to the United States. Ruben Tanenbaum owned a delicatessen. Morris Tanenbaum attended Johns Hopkins University, earning his bachelor's degree in chemistry in 1949. As a sophomore at Johns Hopkins University, Tanenbaum met his future wife Charlotte Silver. Their engagement was announced in September 1949, after his graduation from Johns Hopkins. Encouraged by professor Clark Bricker, who was himself moving, Tanenbaum went from Johns Hopkins to Princeton University for his doctoral work. At Princeton, Tanenbaum first studied spectroscopy with Bricker. He then did his thesis work with Walter Kauzmann, studying the properties of metal single crystals. Tanenbaum received his Ph.D. in chemistry from Princeton in 1952 after completing a doctoral dissertation titled \\"Studies of the plastic flow and annealing behavior of zinc crystals.\\" Career Morris Tanenbaum joined the chemistry department at Bell Telephone Laboratories in 1952. He held a number of positions during his career at Bell, beginning in the technical staff (1952-1956); becoming Assistant Director of the Metallurgical Department (1956-1962); becoming Director of the Solid-State Development Laboratory (1962-1964); and rising to Executive Vice President for Systems Engineering and Development (1975-1976). Tanenbaum then moved to the Western Electric Company, where he worked as Director of Research and Development (1964-1968), Vice President of the Engineering Division (1968-1972) and Vice President of Manufacturing: Transmission Equipment (1972-1975). He returned to Bell Laboratories in 1975 as Vice President of Engineering and Network Services (1976-1978). He served briefly as president of the New Jersey Bell Telephone Company (1978-1980), before returning again to Bell Laboratories as Executive Vice President for Administration (1980-1984). As of January 16, 1985, he was appointed \\"corporate executive vice president responsible for financial management and strategic planning\\". Concerns that AT&T; and Bell Laboratories effectively held a monopoly on communication technology throughout the United States and Canada led to an antitrust case, United States v. AT&T;, and the eventual breakup of the Bell System. Tanenbaum was closely involved in discussion of related senate legislation and helped to draft the proposed \\"Baxter I\\" amendment. Following the restructuring, Tanenbaum became the first Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board at AT&T; Corporation (1984-1986). From 1986 to 1988 he served as AT&T;'s Vice Chairman for Finance, and from 1988 to 1991, AT&T;'s Vice Chairman for Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Research When Morris Tanenbaum joined the chemistry department at Bell Laboratories in 1952, Bell was a hotbed for semiconductor research. The first transistor had been created there in December 1947 by William Bradford Shockley, John Bardeen and Walter Houser Brattain. Their point-contact transistor, built of germanium, was announced at a press conference in New York City on June 30, 1948. Finding better semiconductor materials to support the \\"transistor effect\\" was a critical area of research at Bell. Gordon Teal and technician Ernest Buehler did pioneering research on the growing and doping of semiconductor crystals between 1949 and 1952. Teal's group built the first grown-junction germanium transistors, which were announced by Shockley at a press conference on July 4, 1951. Meanwhile, Gerald Pearson did important early work investigating the properties of silicon. Tanenbaum's initial work at Bell focused on possible single crystal Group III-V semiconductors such as Indium antimonide (InSb) and gallium antimonide (GaSb). =The first silicon transistor= In 1953, Tanenbaum was asked by Shockley to see if transistors could be made using silicon, from group III-IV. Tanenbaum built on Pearson's research, and worked with technical assistant Ernest Buehler, whom he described as \\"a master craftsman in building apparatus and growing semiconductor crystals.\\" They used samples of highly purified silicon from DuPont to grow crystals. On January 26, 1954, Tanenbaum recorded a successful demonstration of the first silicon transistor in his logbook. However, Bell Laboratories did not draw attention to Tanenbaum's discovery publicly. The successful transistor had been constructed using a rate-growing process, which was felt to be poorly suited to large-scale manufacturing. Diffusion processes, pioneered by Bell's Calvin Fuller, were seen as more promising. Tanenbaum became the team leader for a group studying diffusion's possible application to the fabrication of silicon transistors. In the meantime, Gordon Teal had moved to Texas Instruments, where he was essential to the organization of TI's research department. He also led its team of silicon transistor researchers. On April 14, 1954 he and Willis Adcock successfully tested and demonstrated the first grown-junction silicon transistor. Like Tanenbaum, they used highly purified DuPont silicon. Teal was able to bring the silicon transistor to production. He announced the results and displayed the TI transistors on May 10, 1954 at the Institute of Radio Engineers (IRE) National Conference on Airborne Electronics, in Dayton, Ohio. =The first gas-diffused silicon transistor= By 1954, several researchers at Bell Labs were experimenting with diffusion techniques to create layered semiconductors. Charles A. Lee developed a germanium semiconductor using diffused arsenic in late 1954. Meanwhile Tanenbaum worked with Calvin Fuller, D. E. Thomas, and others to develop a gas diffusion method for silicon semiconductors. Fuller developed a way to expose thin slices of crystalline silicon to gaseous aluminum and antimony, which diffused into the silicon to form thin multiple layers. Tanenbaum needed to establish a reliable electrical contact with the middle layer. After weeks of experimenting, Tanenbaum wrote in his laboratory notebook on March 17, 1955, ‚ÄúThis looks like the transistor we‚Äôve been waiting for. It should be a cinch to make.‚Äù The diffused-base silicon transistor was able to amplify and switch signals above 100 megahertz, at a switching speed 10 times that of previous silicon transistors. The news convinced executive Jack Andrew Morton to return early from a trip to Europe and adopt silicon as the material for the company's future transistor and diode development. In 1956, with financial backing from Arnold Beckman, William Shockley left Bell Labs to form Shockley Semiconductor. Shockley made Tanenbaum an offer but Tanenbaum chose to stay with Bell Labs. The n-p-n silicon transistors created with the double-diffusion method were referred to as \\"mesa transistors\\" for a raised area or \\"mesa\\" above the surrounding layers of etching. The initial goal at Shockley Semiconductor was to fabricate prototype n-p-n silicon transistors, based on the ‚Äúmesa‚Äù structure pioneered by Tanenbaum and his co- workers at Bell Labs. By May 1958 Shockley's employees had successfully met that goal. Bell Laboratories did not take advantage of Tanenbaum's early achievements and capitalize on the possibilities of chip technology. They became increasingly dependent on other companies for microchips and large- scale integrated circuits. Tanenbaum has expressed disappointment at this missed opportunity. =High-field superconducting magnets= After becoming Assistant Director of the Metallurgical Department at Bell Labs in 1962, Tanenbaum led a group doing basic research into applied metallurgy. Gene Kunzler was interested in the electrical properties of commercially important metals at low temperatures. Rudy Kompfner was trying to build maser amplifiers to detect and measure very low microwave signals, and needed high magnetic fields to tune his masers. Kunzler tried developing superconducting coils to meet Kompfner's needs, using lead-bismuth alloys, drawn into wire and insulated with copper. He was able to produce record-setting magnetic fields of one or two thousand gauss, but they were not high enough for Kompfner's use. Berndt Matthias had discovered that a brittle ceramic-like material, Nb3Sn, compounded of niobium and tin, could achieve high temperatures. Tanenbaum worked with technician Ernest Buehler to develop a way to form the Nb3Sn compound into a coil and insulate it. He credits Buehler with the idea behind their PIT (powder in tube) approach. They sought to avoid Nb3Sn's fragility issues by delaying the point at which the material was formed: 1) combining a mixture of ductile, pure niobium metal and tin metal powders in the proper ratio, 2) using it to fill a tube formed from a non-superconducting metal such as copper, silver or stainless steel, 3) drawing the composite tube into a fine wire which could then be coiled and 4) finally heating the already-coiled tube to a temperature at which the niobium and tin powders would react chemically to form Nb3Sn. On December 15, 1960, their first day of testing, Tanenbaum and Kunzler's group tested the high field properties of a rod of Nb3Sn that had been fired at 2400¬∞Celsius. It was still superconducting at 8.8 T, their maximum available field strength. Tanenbaum had wagered Kunzler a bottle of Scotch whiskey for every .3T reached above 2.5T, so this outcome represented an unexpected 21 bottles of Scotch. Testing PIT strands resulted in even more powerful effects. Tanenbaum and Kunzler's group created the first high-field superconducting magnets, showing that Nb3Sn exhibits superconductivity at large currents and strong magnetic fields. Nb3Sn became the first known material suitable for use in high-powered magnets and electric machinery. Their discovery made possible the eventual development of medical imaging devices. Tanenbaum eventually moved from research into management, a change in focus that some speculate may have cost him a Nobel Prize. Awards and honors In 1962, Tanenbaum became a Fellow of the American Physical Society. In 1970, he became a fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). In 1972, Tanenbaum was elected to the National Academy of Engineering, for \\"Achievements in solid state research and technology and in technology transfer from research to manufacturing.\\" In 1984 he received the IEEE Centennial Medal. In 1990 Tanenbaum became a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (AAAS). In 1996 he became a life member of the MIT Corporation, the board of trustees of Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He has received multiple honorary doctorates. In 2013, Tanenbaum received a lifetime achievement award, the Science and Technology Medal, at the 34th Edison Patent Awards which are given by the Research & Development Council of New Jersey.

McDermott began her life‚Äôs work on an Indian reservation in the Dakota Territory where she was a teacher as well as a friend and adviser to Sitting Bull. She went on to be the founder of several educational and medical institutions in Sioux City, Iowa. McDermott also established a religious community which continues as the Benedictine Women of Madison in Wisconsin. Early life Mary Ellen McDermott was born in 1864 in Gallitzin, Pennsylvania. She entered a Benedictine convent in Conception, Missouri at the age of 15 where she became Sister Gertrude. Career In 1881, she traveled to the Dakota Territory where she worked as a principle of the Indian agency parochial school on Standing Rock Indian Reservation. It was there, in 1883, she met Sitting Bull who knocked on her door during a snow storm looking for shelter. This meeting began a long friendship which resulted in Mother Gertrude traveling to Sitting Bull‚Äôs headquarters where she encouraged him to surrender before the coming conflict with the U.S. military. Mother Gertrude is said to have been the last white person to see Sitting Bull before he was killed in battle in 1890. One year later, she left the reservation and traveled to Elkton, South Dakota where, with two other sisters, she founded St. Gertrude‚Äôs Academy. She served as the superior for St. Gertrude‚Äôs which functioned as a convent, a school, an orphanage and a hospital until it burned down in 1894. In 1897, she moved to Sioux City, Iowa with six other sisters, where she established the Sisters of St. Benedict of Sioux City and served as their prioress. In this capacity she supervised the opening of Villa Maria, a home for working girls in 1901, St. Vincent Hospital in 1907, St. Vincent School of Nursing in 1910, St. Monica‚Äôs home for orphans and unwed mothers in 1914, and the Benedictine Hospital in Sterling, Colorado in 1925. St. Vincent Hospital merged with St. Joseph Hospital in 1977 to form a health care center currently named Mercy Medical Center. In 1952, the Sisters of the Order of St. Benedict in Sioux City, at the request of Bishop William P. O‚ÄôConnor of the Madison Wisconsin Diocese, started a high school which eventually became the Academy of St. Benedict. The community eventually moved its monastery to Madison. They are currently known as the Benedictine Women of Madison. Here the community, founded by Mother Gertrude McDermott, continues its legacy of service and innovation as the first ecumenical Benedictine community of sisters in the United States.

She is known for exploring social interactions in her work and using music to express core ideas such as eroticism.  Career  Described as having an \\"... imitation- exploring, comedic approach\\", Prvacki has been creating performance and conceptual art projects for the past 15 years. She addresses topics like art appropriation, eroticism, etiquette, hospitality and mealtimes, leading some to call her the \\"Martha Stewart meets Marina Abramovic\\" of performance art. Prvacki's work often links manners to the ethics of civility. She has stated that, \\"Etiquette is such a heavy term, don't you think? It's time we rescued the term and connected it with ethics. Because the space between good and bad, really, is where we operate.\\" Issues of social anxiety and faux pas are a common thread in her pieces. According to the artist, her experiences of living abroad have shaped her work \\"...I was hypersensitive to the differences, that daily experience of negotiating social situations and always having things go wrong. But when things go wrong, to me, is the most interesting.\\" Prvacki has also tackled ideas of chivalry and clean money, as well as exploring subjects via a musical approach. An accomplished flute player, she created a conceptual audio work for Boston's Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum that was inspired by the building's architectural space. In 2016, she transformed a musical recital into performance art at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles. In 2015, she also explored the relationship between music and eroticism for a solo show at the 1301PE Gallery in Los Angeles. Classical sheet music was covered with doodles of genitalia, in order to provoke the uncomfortable feelings society has about music and female sexuality. Another show at the same gallery examined art appropriation, by creating shadow art from the world's priciest sculptural works. A recent piece was created for the 2017 Chicago Architecture Biennial and resulted from a collaboration with the US architecture firm SO-IL. Four musicians performed in a conservatory wearing giant air filters that completely covered their heads and bodies. Prvacki has also exhibited at art fairs like the 2012 Documenta 13 in Germany and the 2015 Contour Biennial in Belgium. A 2015 show for the ICA Singapore examined issues of sustainability, with regards to large art projects and their potential drain on the world's limited resources. Her ideas from unrealized projects, in the form of blueprints and drawings, were exhibited on the walls of the museum space. One of Prvacki's earlier shows was curated by performance artist Marina Abramovic and involved a money-laundering premise. Prvacki's work can be found in the permanent collections of the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA) and Italy's Castello di Rivoli. She has also exhibited at various venues including the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris, the Utah Museum of Contemporary Art, the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles, Chicago's Smart Museum of Art, Boston's Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum and the 1301PE Gallery in Los Angeles Prvacki will be in residence at San Francisco's de Young museum starting in 2018 until 2019.  Background Prvacki's artistic influences stem from feeling like a foreigner wherever she has lived. Born in Serbia, she is half Romanian and half Serbian, and lived in Singapore as a teenager. She studied theatre, classical flute and beekeeping. Prvacki is married to artist Sam Durant. Her father Milenko Prvacki has lived in Singapore since 1991.

It is the oldest instrument of that type discovered so far.  Excavation history  At the beginning of the 80s, the area was drained east of the main road of ancient Dion. The neighboring river had permanently flooded parts of the archaeological site. In this area, east of the main road, excavations were carried out in the summer of 1992 under the direction of Dimitrios Pandermalis. Opposite the villa of Dionysus, the foundations of a building were uncovered. On the morning of August 19, 1992, archaeologists found pieces of small copper tubes. Furthermore, one found a larger, rectangular, copper plate. The individual finds were partially connected by the compacted soil. After recognizing the meaning of the find, the earth was widely removed and sent for further processing to the workshops. After cleaning the items, it was recognized that it was a musical instrument, a hydraulis. The find was dated on the 1st century BC.Vitruv, DE L'ARCHITECTURE. LIVRE X, VIII. Des orgues hydrauliques. (in Latin and French language)Pandermalis: Œó ŒéŒ¥œÅŒ±œÖŒªŒπœÇ œÑŒøœÖ ŒîŒØŒøœÖ. 1995, page 217.  The instrument  The hydraulis is considered the oldest keyboard instrument in the world. It was built in the 3rd century BC, invented by the engineer Ktesibios in Alexandria. The height of the instrument is 120 cm, width 70 cm. The organ pipes are arranged in two rows and consist of 24 pipes with a diameter of 18 mm and 16 narrow pipes with about 10 mm diameter. They were decorated with silver rings. The body of the organ was decorated with silver stripes and multicolored, rectangular glass ornaments. Valves were opened by keyboard and the air flowing through the organ pipe generated the sound. The instrument is structurally classified between the water organ described by Heron of Alexandria and Vitruvius.Pandermalis: Œó ŒéŒ¥œÅŒ±œÖŒªŒπœÇ œÑŒøœÖ ŒîŒØŒøœÖ. 1995, page 218.  Spreading as a musical instrument  After its invention in the Egyptian Alexandria, the organ arrived in Greece in the Hellenistic period. After its conquest by the Romans it was spread in the Roman Empire. There it was used for musical accompaniment in the competitions in the arenas and played by the wealthy as a domestic musical instrument. At the Byzantine court the hydraulis was a prestigious object. In 757, Constantine V sent an organ as a gift to the French king Pippin the Short. So it came to Central Europe and was discovered by the Catholic Church and eventually developed into a church organ.  Replica of the hydraulis of Dion  With the support of the Greek Ministry of Culture and Sport and the help of Professor Pandermalis, a reconstruction of a water organ was started at the European Cultural Center of Delphi in 1995. They kept to ancient records and to the original excavated in Dion. The instrument was completed in 1999.  Literature  * Dimitris Pandermalis: Œó ŒéŒ¥œÅŒ±œÖŒªŒπœÇ œÑŒøœÖ ŒîŒØŒøœÖ.

Coming from a wealthy family of notaries, he met Claude Monet for the first time around 1880, then settled about thirty metres from the family home in V√©theuil. He quickly became friend with the painter who, ruined, was helped by the Lauvray family. When Monet returned to V√©theuil in 1893, Abel Lauvray accompanied the painter on the Seine on his workboat, which he later handed over to him.Fiche biographique du peintre sur le site de la Maison Ader. He married Jeanne Lejard on 3 February 1908 who gave birth to his only child, Genevi√®ve, in 1913.Biography in English on the 32finearts website. After studying law, Lauvray decided to enrol in the Fernand Cormon's workshop in Paris and, on the advice of Claude Monet, to paint by himself. Following Monet's advice, without copying it, he produced about 1,500 paintings during the 60 years of his career. One-third of these canvases were destroyed during the fire of his workshop in Mantes-la-Jolie at the time of the events related to the French Liberation during World War II. His work was notably revealed to the public during his first posthumous exhibitions in 1963, then during the exhibition organized in 1970 at the Yves Jaubert gallery in Paris for the centenary of his death.Biography of the painter on the site \\"Art en Seine\\". Following the tradition of post-impressionism and strongly marked by his admiration for Claude Monet, Lauvray excels at restoring the soft lights of the surrounding landscapes, which he represents with great delicacy. While most of his work paints the banks of the Seine from V√©theuil to Mantes-la-Jolie, he also illustrates his frequent passages in Touraine and Villeneuve-l√®s-Avignon, as well as his travels in Normandy, Antibes, the Somme (French department), Venice or Greece. Abel Lauvray died in V√©theuil on 19 December 1950.

It was broadcast on NBC from November 4, 1937, until July 25, 1940. As the years changed, so did the title, becoming Good News of 1939 and Good News of 1940. In its last few months on the air, it was known as Maxwell House Coffee Time. Some sources also refer to the program as Hollywood Good News. The program was notable for marking \\"the first time that a national network joined hands with a major film studio to create a show for sale to a commercial sponsor.\\" Format Much like Lux Radio Theatre, which preceded it on radio, Good News of 1938 featured adaptations of films accompanied by interviews with film personalities. Unlike its predecessor, however, Good News was tied to one film company, Metro- Goldwyn-Mayer, which controlled both the financial and programming elements of the show. Also unlike Lux, Good News presented adaptations of upcoming films rather than those that had already been seen in theaters. The program's first episode featured scenes from The Firefly (1937), with Allan Jones and Jeanette MacDonald reprising their roles from the film. Besides adaptations of films, the show offered \\"Backstage at the Movies\\", a feature in which listeners heard MGM executives discussing plans for future films. Good News was presented before a live audience in a 1,500-seat theater. Often more fans waited outside, hoping to get in. The sponsor, Maxwell House coffee, paid $25,000 per week, and MGM took care of the rest. Personnel James Stewart was the program's initial host. Robert Taylor succeeded him in the first half of 1938, and Robert Young followed him the fall of 1938. Beginning in the fall of 1939, a variety of MGM people filled in as hosts, and Dick Powell was the show's final host in 1940. Frank Morgan appeared regularly in a comedy role, as did Fanny Brice and Hanley Stafford in their roles of Baby Snooks and her father. An MGM chorus directed by Max Terrs provided music along with soloists, including Betty Jaynes, Connee Boswell, and Judy Garland. Brice initially appeared on the show's fourth episode on November 25, 1937. Herbert G. Goldman wrote in his book, Fanny Brice: The Original Funny Girl, \\"Baby Snooks put Good News on the hit list and started Fanny on the radio career she would continue for the rest of her short life.\\" After Good News ended, Morgan and Brice continued to perform on Maxwell House Coffee Time, a 30-minute program in which each had a 15-minute segment. Ted Pearson and Warren Hull were the program's announcers. Ed Gardner was the director, and Meredith Willson was the musical director. Producers included Bill Bacher. Critical reaction A writer for the Detroit Free Press found flaws in Good News of 1938. Edgar A Guest, Jr., writing in the newspaper's February 20, 1938, issue, commented that the program \\"could be much more entertaining if more care were taken with the production work.\\" He cited noise from the audience that was audible at inappropriate times and \\"at least half a dozen mistakes\\" in one episode when stars noticeably missed cues or mangled lines in the script. *  References  External links =Logs= *Log of episodes of Good News of 1938 from Jerry Haendiges Vintage Radio Logs *Log of episodes of Good News of 1938 from Old Time Radio Researchers Group *Log of episodes of Good News of 1938 from radioGOLDINdex *Log of episodes of Good News of 1939 from radioGOLDINdex *Log of episodes of Good News of 1940 from radioGOLDINdex =Streaming= *Episodes of Good News of 1938 from Dumb.com *Episodes of Good News of 1938 from Old Time Radio Researchers Group Library 1937 radio programme debuts 1940 radio programme endings NBC radio programs 1930s American radio programs 1940s American radio programs ","title":"Good News of 1938"},{"id":"56542724","title":"1993 McDonald's All-American Boys Game"},{"id":"56542756","text":"Natalia Alimova (born 6 February 1978 in Saint Petersburg), is a volleyball player from Russia.

Plot Lonely photographer Martin feels nothing but solitude in his existence, work, and even relationships with others. He is repeatedly reminded that everything boils down to nothing more than base animal nature. One evening at an exhibition he notices a woman observing his work in a gallery, studying a photograph he holds as particularly important and meaningful. For that brief instant his life and all of his work seems to have some sort of meaning. He later sees the same woman, Rebecca, attending a wedding that he has been hired to photograph, and he approaches her during the reception. They discuss a variety of topics openly and he admires her strong mind and personality. They spend the night together and he believes that he has found his soulmate but in the morning he finds that she has disappeared and left a simple note with her phone number. He calls her but does not receive the enthusiastic response he desires, turning his initially positive feelings toward her into an obsession. He locates her address in the phone book and sneaks into her apartment building. There he spots her returning to her apartment with a man and he waits outside her apartment all night as his positive feelings toward her mix with disgust. The next day she visits him at his apartment and cooks dinner, during which he confronts her about the other man, Peter. Their differing perceptions and ideals of human nature and relationships lead to a heated argument. He holds her down and forces her to say that she loves him, then she immediately runs out of the apartment when she has a chance. The next day he visits Rebecca's apartment and gets Peter's address from her roommate, who says that the two are out for lunch together. He drives toward Peter's house, planning to confront them when they return from lunch, but his car runs out of gas on the drive. In an effort to stop them on the road, he pushes a large boulder off the cliff onto the road, inadvertently hitting the car in which she is riding. In the final scene Rebecca is shown in an immobile state connected to life support equipment as Martin happily states that they have been together for a year now.

He is considered to be one of the most accomplished contemporary Arab calligraphers today. Nassar is best known for his serious academic research on Islamic Calligraphy and for his academic and artistic efforts in reviving Muhaqqaq (one of the six classical scripts ÿßŸÑÿÆÿ∑Ÿàÿ∑ ÿßŸÑÿ≥ÿ™ÿ©) as a successful artistic medium for contemporary Islamic calligraphers. Nassar was the first Jordanian to obtain the traditional Ijaza in calligraphy from the Islamic world's premier master calligrapher, Hasan √áelebi, in 2003, Istanbul. In April 2018, he was awarded The Artistic Creativity Award for his academic and artistic efforts in reviving Muhaqqaq script by the Arab Thought Foundation (ATF).  Biography  Nassar was born in Amman, Jordan. He is the youngest son of the well-known Jordanian-Palestinian poet Muhammad Mansour Abu Mansour (1913-2000). His family came originally from Joureesh (ÿ¨Ÿàÿ±Ÿäÿ¥), Nablus in Palestine, but Nassar has lived his entire life in Amman. He obtained his BA in Islamic studies, economics and statistics from the University of Jordan in 1988. Later in 1997, he graduated with an MA degree in Islamic Arts specializing in Islamic Calligraphy from Al al-Bayt University in Jordan. In 2007, Nassar was awarded a PhD in the Art of Islamic Calligraphy from the Prince's School of Traditional Arts (PSTA), London.  Academic and Artistic Career  Nassar's Ijaza, 2003 Nassar started his academic career straight after graduation as a lecturer (1988-1995) of Arabic Calligraphy at the Faculty of Education and the Language Centre at the University of Jordan. In 1998, he became a member of Al-Balqa\` Applied University in Jordan where he contributed to the setting up of the Institute of Traditional Islamic Arts in 1998. This institute was responsible for the reconstruction of the twelfth-century Saladin's pulpit (minbar) (ŸÖŸÜÿ®ÿ± ÿµŸÑÿßÿ≠ ÿßŸÑÿØŸäŸÜ) which was later in 2006 installed in its original place at al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem. Nassar was mainly in charge of redrawing and designing the entire inscriptions and ornamentation of the Minbar. Nassar lectured at the Prince's School of Traditional Arts from 2002 to 2007 when he was working on his PhD. Nassar currently is the professor of Islamic Calligraphy and Qur‚Äôanic manuscripts at the department of Islamic Arts, at the College of Islamic Arts and Architecture, W.I.S.E University, Jordan, and a researcher in The Islamic Manuscript Association (TIMA), Cambridge, project of cataloguing the Mamluk and Ilkhanid Qur‚Äôan manuscripts at Dar el-Kotob in Cairo.  Artworks and Exhibitions  Kun, 2003, permanent collection at The British Museum, London. Nassar's calligraphy works reflect the content and the meaning of the words and text, a style he has developed over the last 20 years of practice and research. His artworks demonstrate beauty and simplicity. His works are not limited to ink on paper, they extend to other media such as stone, ceramic, mosaic, glass, wood, metals and more. Nassar's Art works are to be found at the permanent collections of many world museums such as: The British Museum in London, The Contemporary Museum of Calligraphy in Moscow, The Aga Khan Museum in Toronto, The Jordan National Gallery of Fine Arts in Amman and in many private collections around the world. He has participated in numerous calligraphy conferences, workshops and exhibitions in the Middle East, Europe, USA, Australia, Canada, Pakistan, Malaysia, Iran, Russia and Japan. = Solo Exhibitions References = * 2017 From the Heart to the Pen, Arabic Calligraphy Artworks, in collaboration with his pupil Sir Mark Allen, Calligraphy Museum, Sharjah.

About Nassar‚Äôs Artwork  ‚ÄúIf you come from a tradition that has renounced representation in religious context, such as Islam (there are no image in the Koran or in mosque), how do you-how can you-shape that thinking through Art? Nassar Mansour's Kun shows exactly the same moment of creation as represented in Michelangelo, but graphically. The Qur‚Äôan describes the moment of creation as ‚ÄúHe said to him, ‚ÄòBe!‚Äô and it was.‚Äù The artist, instead of showing the event, shows us the Word of the Arabic script itself; Kun is the Arabic for ‚Äúbe‚Äù. The creation of humanity. The continuing word. A totally different way of imagining ourselves. Neil MacGregor, Director of The British Museum (2002 to 2015). ‚ÄúMansour is a khattat, a calligrapher who not only writes the basmala well but who \\"has dedicated his life to the service of beautiful writing, the essence of the meaning of the word calligraphy\\", according to Venetia Porter, Assistant Keeper (Curator), Islamic and Contemporary Middle East Department, The British Museum. Sir Mark Allen wrote: \\"Mansour is notable for the mission we see in his art and his writing to give new life to the venerable Muhaqqaq script, one of the six classical scripts of Arabic calligraphy‚Äù. ‚ÄúI studied calligraphy for a few months with Nassar Mansour, a Jordanian artist, a very serious and exacting teacher. I was only able to study erratically, but it gave me neuromas admiration for these artists and the traditions in which they work‚Äù. Vikram Seth, Trustee of The British Museum. ‚ÄúKun is an extraordinarily elegant and powerful graphic work, and obviously very much part of the Arabic tradition of calligraphy which goes back 1,500 years or so. But you do not have to be able to read Arabic to enjoy it ‚Äìthis is just a beautiful abstract design. The fact that it is a wird adds a punch‚Äù. David Barrie, Director, The Art Fund UK.

De Cheyneston had already been a monk at the Abbey (and by 1337, a senior official within the administration) before his election as Abbot. Much of his Abbacy was punctuated with financial expense and outlays. De Cheyneston calculated that his house had at least ¬£20 in debts. The same year he took office De Cheyneston's abbatial finances suffered for the first‚Äîbut not last‚Äîtime. Some of the Abbey's granges burnt down, which not only meant that they lost all the corn that was being stored in them when it happened, but also had to go and purchase more corn to live on until the next harvest. Around the same time de Cheyneston was indicted before the King's escheator over a matter of his unlicensed acquisition of twelve burgages of land in the village of Over. For this, he paid a fine of ¬£10 and received both a pardon for the offences and a license for his new lands. Soon after, a curious episode took place, the exact nature of which is unknown (except that it involved the deaths of two local men, Robert Hykes and John Bulderdog). In any case, the result of which was that two of de Cheynestone's monks were later indicted for the killings and for which they in turn paid a ¬£10 fine, and another ¬£10 to the Court of Common Pleas. De Cheynestone was concerned with an ongoing legal-dispute between Vale Royal and Shrewsbury Abbey from almost the moment he took office, which had begun in Abbot Peter's‚ÄîRobert's predecessor's‚Äî time. On Peter's death in 1340, the Abbot of Shrewsbury simply presented de Cheynston with another writ of scire facias, and the dispute continued with \\"many allegations of each party.\\" It was not settled until 1343, when de Cheyneston settled the Abbot of Shrewsbury's expenses for ¬£100. Abbot de Cheyneston continued the building works which had been on-going, but which, due to a perennial state of penury, had never been completed in the fifty years since the Abbey's foundation. The monks own quarters‚Äîwhich were meant to have been temporary refuges while the building work took place‚Äîwere also dilapidated. He managed, with the slender resources at his disposal, to give the choir and north end of the church a lead roof in the first two years of his reign but could not afford to have any further substantial work carried out. Robert de Cheyneston was succeeded as Abbot of Vale Royale by one Thomas, although Thomas was not to be elected until 1351.

West was inducted into the United States Air Force Hall of Fame in 2018.  Early life and education  West was born as Gladys Mae Brown in Sutherland, Virginia, in Dinwiddie County, a rural county south of Richmond. Her family was an African- American farming family in a community of sharecroppers. Her mother worked at a tobacco factory, and her father was a farmer who also worked for the railroad. West realized early on that she did not want to work in the tobacco fields or factories like the rest of her family, and decided that education would be her way out. At West's high school, the top two students of each graduating class received full-ride scholarships to Virginia State College (now formally University), a historically black public university. West worked hard and graduated in 1948 with the title of valedictorian. She was initially unsure what college major to pursue at VSU, as she had excelled in all her subjects in high school. She was encouraged to major in science or math because of their difficulty, and West ultimately chose to study mathematics, a subject mostly studied at her college by men. She also became a member of the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority. West graduated in 1952 with a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics. After graduating, she taught math and science for two years in Waverly, Virginia. West then returned to VSU to complete her Master of Mathematics degree, graduating in 1955. Afterwards, she briefly took another teaching position in Martinsville, Virginia.  Career  Data processing report for GeoSat by Gladys West In 1956, West was hired to work at the Naval Proving Ground in Dahlgren, Virginia, (now called the Naval Surface Warfare Center), where she was the second black woman ever hired and one of only four black employees. West was a programmer in the Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division for large-scale computers and a project manager for data- processing systems used in the analysis of satellite data. Concurrently, West earned a second master's degree in public administration from the University of Oklahoma. In the early 1960s, she participated in an award-winning astronomical study that proved the regularity of Pluto‚Äôs motion relative to Neptune. Subsequently, West began to analyze data from satellites, putting together altimeter models of the Earth's shape. She became project manager for the Seasat radar altimetry project, the first satellite that could remotely sense oceans. West consistently put in extra hours, cutting her team's processing time in half. She was recommended for a commendation in 1979. From the mid-1970s through the 1980s, West programmed an IBM computer to deliver increasingly precise calculations to model the shape of the Earth ‚Äì an ellipsoid with irregularities, known as the geoid. Generating an extremely accurate model required her to employ complex algorithms to account for variations in gravitational, tidal, and other forces that distort Earth's shape. West's data ultimately became the basis for the Global Positioning System (GPS). In 1986, West published Data Processing System Specifications for the Geosat Satellite Radar Altimeter, a 51-page technical report from The Naval Surface Weapons Center (NSWC). The guide was published to explain how to increase the accuracy of the estimation of geoid heights and vertical deflection, important components of satellite geodesy. This was achieved by processing the data created from the radio altimeter on the Geosat satellite, which went into orbit on March 12, 1984. West worked at Dahlgren for 42 years, retiring in 1998. After retiring, she completed a PhD in Public Administration from Virginia Tech. Legacy Gladys West being inducted into the Air Force Space and Missile Pioneers Hall of Fame in 2018 West's vital contributions to GPS technology were rediscovered when a member of West's sorority Alpha Kappa Alpha read a short biography Gladys had submitted for an alumni function. West was inducted into the United States Air Force Hall of Fame in 2018, one of the highest honors bestowed by Air Force Space Command (AFSPC). The AFSPC press release at the time called her one of \\"the so-called 'Hidden Figures' part of the team who did computing for the US military in the era before electronic systems\\" ‚Äì a reference to the 2016 book by Margot Lee Shetterly, which was adapted into the film Hidden Figures.\\"Science History: Gladys West maps the future\\", Cosmos, October 14, 2019. Capt. Godfrey Weekes, commanding officer at the Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division in 2018, described the role played by West in the development of Global Positioning System: \\"She rose through the ranks, worked on the satellite geodesy, and contributed to the accuracy of GPS and the measurement of satellite data. As Gladys West started her career as a mathematician at Dahlgren in 1956, she likely had no idea that her work would impact the world for decades to come.\\"Capt. Godfrey Weekes, in a 2017 message about Black History Month, as quoted by Dyson (2018). West agreed, saying that she had no idea at the time that her work would affect so many: ‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôre working every day, you‚Äôre not thinking, 'What impact is this going to have on the world?' You're thinking, 'I've got to get this right.'\\" West was selected by the BBC as part of their 100 Women of 2018. As an alumna of Virginia State University Dr. Gladys West was nominated and won the award for \\"Female Alumna of the Year\\" at the Historically Black Colleges and Universities Awards sponsored by HBCU Digest in 2018. Personal life She met her husband Ira West at the Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division, where he also worked as a mathematician. They were two of only four black employees at the time. They were married in 1957. They have three children and seven grandchildren. , West lives in King George County, Virginia. In 2018, West completed a PhD via a distance-learning program with Virginia Tech. West continues to prefer using a paper map over a tracking system, saying she still trusts her brain above all.

The IAMSAR Handbook is jointly published by two UN agencies: * International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) * International Maritime Organization (IMO) It contains guidelines for Search and Rescue in terms of shipping and aviation. The purpose of a common manual is to ensure that cooperation between the two areas of operation is effective and that operational cooperation can be carried out in actual rescue operations between different organizational and rescue units. It is important to ensure smooth cooperation between the two areas because many ship and aircraft accidents involve both ships and aircraft in the search and rescue operations. The IAMSAR Manual consists of three volumes, which are published as a loose-leaf collection. * Volume I. Organization and Management * Volume II. Mission Co- ordination * Volume III. Mobile Facilities Volume I, \\"Organization and Management\\", deals with the meaning of international, regional and national Search and Rescue activities and intergovernmental cooperation in order to achieve well-functioning and cost-effective SAR work. This volume is aimed primarily at the relevant government agencies. Volume II, \\"Mission Co- ordination\\", provides guidelines for the planning and implementation of rescue operations and exercises. Volume II is to be carried on board rescue units and all other aircraft and ships that have the capacity, and in some cases, an obligation, to participate in Search and Rescue work The target groups are rescue organizations and the national rescue centers (JRCC, MRCC, and ARCC). Volume III, \\"Mobile Facilities\\" ,must be carried on board by all vehicles that can undertake search or rescue tasks. This includes all merchant ships, as in an emergency they must be able to perform SAR operations and coordinate as on- scene commander. Volume III describes in detail communication, organization and search methodology on site. It also contains guidelines for SAR aspects regarding evacuation of your own craft in an emergency. Future additions being considered include enhanced man overboard (MOB) technologies, including SAR operation software for ECDIS and SAR drones.  Adoption  The United States' National Search and Rescue Supplement was written as a supplement to the IAMSAR, and together they constitute the U.S.'s National Search and Rescue Plan. The United States Coast Guard also publishes an addendum to the supplement which is referenced several times in the USCG's Radiotelephone Handbook.  Usage during major SAR operations  The Malaysian Airlines‚Äô MH370 disappearance led ICAO to propose changes to how SAR air operations are conducted and prepared for, including the mandatory carriage of automatically deployable flight recorders.

Design and development The Bo≈ºena was designed and home-built by seventeen year-old W≈Çadys≈Çaw Stelmaszyk from Ludomy during 1928, with financial help from LOPP. After some public ceremony and a donation of motoring petrol from a local clergyman, Jozefat Skrzypek, a pilot from the Polish Airmen's Association, took it on its first flight on 6 December 1928. The all-wood Bo≈ºena was a braced high wing monoplane, with a two-part, constant-chord wing out to semi-elliptical tips. Plywood covered, the wing had a constant section and thickness and was built around two spars. Each half-wing was braced to the lower fuselage longerons by a pair of parallel steel tubes, enclosed in streamlined fairings, they met centrally on a faired pylon forward of the cockpit. The Bo≈ºena was powered by a Anzani 2A three-cylinder radial engine mounted with its cylinders exposed for cooling in a strongly tapered nose. Its rectangular section fuselage was plywood-covered, with rounded decking behind the cockpit. The empennage was also ply-covered, with a rectangular plan tailplane and elevators mounted on top of the fuselage and a cropped triangular fin carrying a deep rectangular rudder which moved in an elevator cut-out. Its fixed landing gear was simple and conventional, with steel V-struts from the lower fuselage longerons and a single axle with rubber shock absorbers. Early test flight reports noted the Bo≈ºena's combination of stability in windy conditions with good control responsiveity and manoeuvreability. Its short landing run and easy approach were also noted. It isis known to have made five flights in the winter of 1928-9, some on skis, and it also won a cash prize large enough to cover all costs, including that of the engine. Later it was on display in the Polish Army Museum in Pozna≈Ñ and in early 1938 returned to Ludomy, where it was destroyed during the German invasion of Poland. In 1975 Stelmaszyk built a replica of the Bo≈ºena for the Museum of Aviation and Astronautics in Krakow which remained there, though not on display, in 2009.

One grave site within the cemetery is also designated separately as a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark since 1983. History Oakwood Cemetery Chapel The original 20 acres that form the City Cemetery were deeded to the City of Fort Worth by local civic leader John Peter Smith in 1879, after the city's oldest cemetery, Pioneers Rest, had rapidly filled. In 1880, a section of the property was partitioned off and limited to Catholic burials at the request of Bishop C.W. Dubois of Galveston. This new Catholic section was named Calvary Cemetery. The Oakwood Cemetery Association formed in 1908 and a chapel was built on the north end of the property in 1912. In 1926 a new Oakwood Cemetery Association charter was instated requiring a five-member board of directors. The president of the Fort Worth National Bank, the institution that held the association's funds in trust, was required to be a director; of the remaining four members, two had to be women. Among the first board members were Jennie Scott Scheuber, a local civic leader and the city's first librarian, and Major K.M. Van Zandt, longtime president of the Fort Worth National Bank. In 1952, the charter was amended to allow board representation from any bank in Fort Worth with oversight of the association's endowment. Notable graves and monuments Mausoleums at Oakwood Cemetery Oakwood Cemetery is home to Bartenders' Row, a section of graves belonging to bartenders from Fort Worth's notorious Hell's Half Acre, and Bricklayers' Row, a section formerly reserved for members of the local bricklayers' union.

Schuyler, who in his day was known as \\"America's first railroad king,\\" is best known today for his role in America‚Äôs first large-scale stock fraud on the New York and New Haven Railroad. His scandal is among the greatest scandals in Wall Street history alongside the Bernie Madoff scandal and the Richard Whitney scandal. Early life Schuyler was born in Rhinebeck, New York in 1798. He was the youngest of five children born to Philip Jeremiah Schuyler (1768‚Äì1835), a U.S. Representative, and Sarah Rutsen (1770‚Äì1803), who died when he was young. After his mother's death in 1803, his father remarried to Mary Anna Sawyer (1786‚Äì1852), the daughter of Micajah Sawyer, a founding member of American Academy of Arts and Sciences, with whom he had three more children. His siblings from his parents marriage were Philip P. Schuyler, who married Rosanna Livingston; Stephan Van Rensselaer Schuyler, who married Catherine Morris; Catherine Schuyler, who married Samuel Jones; and John Rutsen Schuyler. His half-siblings from his father's second marriage were William Schuyler; Sybil Schuyler; and George Lee Schuyler (1811‚Äì1890), who married Eliza Hamilton, daughter of his cousin, James Alexander Hamilton (son of Alexander Hamilton and Eliza Schuyler Hamilton). After her death, he married Eliza's sister, Mary Morris Hamilton. His paternal grandparents were Philip Schuyler (1733‚Äì1804), a Revolutionary War General and U.S. Senator, and Catherine Van Rensselaer (1734‚Äì1803), a member of the prominent Van Rensselaer family. His maternal grandfather was John Rutsen (1743‚Äì1771), a descendant of Wilhelmus Beekman and inheritor of a large portion of the Beekman Patent, which encompassed much of what is now Dutchess County. Schuyler graduated with a B.A. degree from Harvard College in 1817, where he was a member of Phi Beta Kappa society, and the Porcellian Club, along with Samuel Atkins Eliot, Wyllys Lyman, Samuel Joseph May, Thomas Russell Sullivan, Charles Henry Warren, and Francis William Winthrop. His mathematical thesis at Harvard was on \\"fluxional solutions.\\" Career Schuyler started his career with steamboats. In 1838, he was president of the New York and Boston Transportation Company, of which William W. Woolsey, Moses B. Ives, and James G. King were among the directors. The company later became known as the New Jersery Steam Navigation and Transportation Company as well as the Transportation Company. He owned steamboats, including one called the Chancellor Livingston in the 1840s, which was his principal business. Around 1846, he became involved with the railroads along with his half-brother, George Lee Schuyler, who formed R. & G. L. Schuyler, a railroad contracting firm. According to William B. Astor, Schuyler was spoken of as a skillful engineer and a man of good business capacity. =Railroad career= At one time, Schuyler was president of five railroads, including the New York & New Haven Railroad, the Harlem, the Illinois Central, the Rensselaer & Saratoga, and the Sangamon & Morgan Railroads. In addition to helping develop several others, including the Vermont Valley Railroad, thereby earning the title of \\"America‚Äôs first railroad king.\\" He was also secretary of the Brooklyn and Jamaica Railroad, treasurer of the Housatonic Railroad Company, and vice-president of the New Jersey Railroad and Transportation Company. During his career, Schuyler was considered a master negotiator and when he was president of the Harlem Railroad, he arranged a running agreement with Edwin D. Morgan, then the president of the Hudson River Railroad, and later a U.S. Senator and Governor of New York. He was involved with many of the leading bankers, financiers, and investors of the day including, Gouverneur Morris, Elihu Townsend, Cornelius Vanderbilt, and August Belmont. Schuyler was also a founding member of the Union Club, the city's oldest social club. From March 19, 1851 to July 3, 1854, Schuyler served as the first president of Illinois Central Railroad, following his company's initial purchase of a finished portion of the railway from Jacksonville to Meredosia in the 1840s. The Railroad was the recipient of the first federal land grant. Upon his resignation following the 1854 scandal, he was succeeded by the vice- president of the Railroad, William Porter Burrall. =1854 fraud= Schuyler served as president of the New York and New Haven Railroad, which began service on Christmas Day, 1848. In addition to his role as president, he was also the company's sole transfer agent, which meant that every sale of the company stock went through him alone. Following the Norwalk disaster in 1853, and after the railroad's stock price dropped in the summer of 1854, he wrote to the board of directors resigning and stating \\"Your attention to the stock ledgers of your Company is essential, as you will find there is much that is wrong.\\" The discovery of his fraud in 1854 has been referred to as \\"America‚Äôs first large-scale stock fraud.\\" It was eventually discovered that Schuyler issued 19,540 shares in unauthorized stock certificates (worth approximately $2 million ) for the Railroad. To compound matters, Schuyler had used the fraudulent stock as collateral against loans taken out by several people, including one from Cornelius Vanderbilt for . Due to Schuyler's vast business interest and prominence at the highest levels of New York society, the discovery caused a shock and sensation throughout the northeast. The fraud caused the railroad to endure years of legal battles as well as a loss of $1.8 million . Indirectly, the fraud caused Wall Street to enact legal and procedural changes to avoid similar types of fraud. While the Justice Daniel P. Ingraham of the New York State Supreme Court initially found that the stock issued by Schuyler was void, the appeal eventually made it the U.S. Supreme Court where the fraudulently issued stocks were upheld. The newspapers of the day covered the fraud and its effects for several years. Schuyler wrote to The New York Times in July 1855, attempting to explain away the scandal as a misunderstanding stating \\"I hope you will publish this statement, which I have prepared under great difficulty--without documents, and upon your report alone --in the greatest debility of body, and in broken spirit, but with clear recollection.\\" Following the scandal, Schuyler fled to Canada through Quebec. He then went on to Geneva and Nice, France, where he died in November 1855, apparently caused by \\"grief and mortification.\\" Personal life Schuyler maintained a residence at 149 Mercer Street during his time in New York City. Schuyler, who was known to society as a bachelor, had a long term relationship with Lucinda Waldron \\"Lucy\\" Wood (1807‚Äì1882). Together, they were the parents of six children. Reportedly, even though he was the father of her children, they didn't marry because she was from a less well-known and respectable family than his. However, when his eldest daughters wanted to marry, her fianc√© discovered that her father was the famous Robert Schuyler and that she was, in fact, an illegitimate child. The fianc√©, a Reverend, insisted that in order for them to marry, her parents must marry. Therefore, Schuyler agreed to married Lucinda and installed her and the family in a fashionable home in Manhattan on 22nd Street. Other reports indicated that he actually married Wood in 1826, but didn't socially acknowledge the marriage until the 1850s. Their children included: * Julia Wood Schuyler, who married Rev. William Orne Lamson (1824‚Äì1909) in 1850. * Robert Sands Schuyler (1830‚Äì1895), who married Caroline E. Acker (1840‚Äì1905) in 1864. * Catherine Schuyler * Louisa Schuyler * George Schuyler * William Sawyer Schuyler (1840‚Äì1864), who married Florence Miriam Barbour (1840‚Äì1895), daughter of Oliver Lorenzo Barbour and niece of Chancellor Reuben H. Walworth, in 1859. William, a Captain with the 155th Regiment and aide-de-camp, died from wounds sustained in the Battle of Cold Harbor during the American Civil War. Schuyler died in Nice, France on November 15, 1855. His coffin was sent back to New York and he was buried at Greenridge Cemetery in Saratoga Springs, New York. Even after his death, the newspapers reported seeing him abroad. Following his death, his New York City home and its contents were auctioned off and reportedly became a brothel run by \\"Mrs. Van Ness.\\" After his death, his widow moved back to the United States and retired to a cabin on Saratoga Lake. =Descendants= Through his daughter Julia, he was the grandfather of Major Robert Schuyler Lamson (1855‚Äì1876), who died at 21 years of age at Darfour in Upper Egypt from malarious fever while serving in the Egyptian Army as a mercenary, and George Henry Lamson (1852‚Äì1882), a doctor in Paris who developed a morphine addiction, which was said to have caused him to murder his wife's brother. He was found guilty of murder and hanged in 1882 at Wandsworth Gaol in London. Through his youngest son William, he was the grandfather of Philip William Schuyler (b. 1861), who married Amanda Mason Erwen, daughter of Robert Moody Erwen and Agnes (n√©e Gominger) Erwen, in 1886.

The episode was written by Edithe Swenson and Joel Metzger, and directed by Garth Maxwell; it first aired on October 9, 2000. The series, set in Ancient Greece, focuses on Xena (Lucy Lawless), a ruthless warrior seeking redemption for her past actions. Throughout her adventures, she is accompanied by her best friend Gabrielle (Renee O'Connor), who assists her in recognizing and pursuing the greater good. In the episode, Xena, her daughter Eve (Adrienne Wilkinson), and Gabrielle travel to visit Xena's mother Cyrene (Darien Takle) in Amphipolis, which they realize has become a ghost town. While investigating, Xena discovers Cyrene was accused of being a witch after she started to hear voices and was burned at the stake. The trio also realize Xena's childhood home is haunted and that the demon Mephistopheles (Anthony Ray Parker) is responsible for the current situation in Amphipolis. \\"The Haunting of Amphipolis\\" was originally written by an unnamed writer who was replaced by Metzger because the dialogue he wrote was unsuitable. When Metzger was hired, the writing staff requested numerous changes to the original script, which featured a murdered man and his daughter. The changes included the addition of Mephistopheles as the main antagonist. According to Metzger, besides focusing on the haunting of Xena's childhood home, the final product bears no resemblance to the original script. Many of the scenes in this episode required the use of special effects and CGI. A scene involving Gabrielle being dragged underwater by ghouls was filmed using only practical effects and stunt performers. Upon airing, the episode received positive reviews from critics who praised its horror elements and dark tone. Multiple scenes involving Gabrielle's demonic encounters, and Eve being confronted by illusions of her victims were also commended. Plot Looking down from the heavens, archangels Michael and Raphael discuss Xena's difficult destiny as she arrives at Amphipolis with Gabrielle and Eve to visit Xena's mother, Cyrene. When they arrive, the trio realize Amphipolis has become a ghost town. In Cyrene's tavern, Eve sees Cyrene's spirit and tells Xena her mother is dead. Xena goes to the mausoleum where she finds Cyrene's sarcophagus, which contains charred remains. While eating, Eve tells Gabrielle that she feels something terrible is about to occur. Gabrielle's food becomes instantly infested with maggots. Maggots then begin to emerge from Gabrielle's hands and her flesh rots. When Eve prays to Eli to cast out the evil presence, the maggots disappear and Gabrielle's hands are restored. Later, Gabrielle is grabbed by numerous hands and lands in a pool of water filled with ghouls. Hearing her screams, Xena and Eve save her. Eve tells Xena and Gabrielle the demon Mephistopheles is preparing for war, that the tavern is his exit from Hell, and that Eve's presence there is deliberate. Mephistopheles possesses Gabrielle as she takes a shower. He tells Xena he has kidnapped Cyrene's soul and will not release it unless Eve's blood is spilled because the blood of the Messenger of Eli is necessary for him to escape Hell. Xena refuses and Eve exorcises him. Mephistopheles then torments Eve, reminding her of her bloody past before her redemption. He also joins Xena and Gabrielle's bodies every time they touch. Once Eve separates them, Xena uses the pinch‚Äîa skill that allows her to stop blood from flowing‚Äîon herself. She visits the spirit realm to defeat Mephistopheles, who tells her whoever kills him must assume his reign over Hell. After Gabrielle revives Xena, Eve says she is ready to sacrifice herself to stop Mephistopheles. Xena decides to fight him instead, so Eve cuts her palm and spills a few drops of blood. Mephistopheles emerges from a Hellmouth and battles Xena until she kills him. This releases Cyrene's soul, who tells Xena she will always be in her heart. While pondering the consequences of Mephistopheles' death, the trio notice the Hellmouth is starting to release steam. Production=Development and writing= The inclusion of alt=Image shows an 1828 lithograph by Eug√®ne Delacroix, showing the German demon Mephistopheles flying over Wittenberg. The 44-minute, 23-second episode was written by Edithe Swenson and Joel Metzger, and was directed by Garth Maxwell. According to Metzger, the episode was originally written by an unnamed writer whom he replaced because the producers felt the original writer had not \\"captured the Xena voices at all\\". After handing in his first draft of the episode, Metzger‚Äîwho was a freelancer‚Äî was offered a job on the writing staff. The idea of featuring an episode about a haunting at Xena's childhood home came from the writing staff. The original plot of the episode featured a murdered man who had a daughter. At the request of the staff, Metzer added Mephistopheles as the main villain. He added the subplot about Xena's mother being trapped in Hell to make the story \\"closer to home and [ensure] Xena had a personal stake in it\\". By the end of the final draft, most of the original plot and scenes had been changed, with only the core concept of Xena's house being haunted remaining. =Filming and effects= According to Maxwell, the episode is \\"built around\\" the use of numerous special effects. He described the experience of directing this episode as challenging, because \\"things move at their own slightly slower pace\\". The scene in which Gabrielle is dragged underwater by ghouls does not include any special effects; it was filmed inside a glass water tank on a closed set, enclosed by a curtain for lightning and filming purposes. Inside the water, prop skeletons and \\"slimy\\" pieces of fabric were inserted alongside O'Connor and stunt performers portraying the ghouls. The water inside the tank was placed at a level that allowed the actors to stand with their heads above the water, but also allowed the stunt performers to drag O'Connor underwater. The cameras were placed close to the dry side of the glass tank. The water inside the tank was warm to ensure O'Connor and the stunt performers would not get sick. Due to its lack of special effects, Maxwell said this scene was filmed in a very relaxed and spontaneous way. According to O'Connor, the scene in which Xena and Gabrielle have their arms and legs joined by Mephistopheles, she and Lucy Lawless had a stocking net placed over their arms and the rest was computer-generated. O'Connor described this scene as difficult to film because of the height difference between her and Lawless, and as \\"quite hilarious\\" and enjoyable to film. Broadcast and release \\"The Haunting of Amphipolis\\" was first broadcast on syndication on October 9, 2000. During its original broadcast, the episode received an average audience (AA) Nielsen rating of 2.9. It was the fourth-most-watched syndicated action drama of the week, behind Andromeda, The X-Files, and ER. This marked a drop in viewership from the previous episode, \\"Coming Home\\", which earned a rating of 3.3. The episode was first released for home media use on VHS in the United Kingdom as part of a three-episode collection with \\"Coming Home\\" and \\"Heart of Darkness\\". It was released on DVD as part of the sixth season on March 8, 2005. \\"The Haunting of Amphipolis\\" has also been made available on various streaming video on demand services, including Amazon Video, iTunes, and Hulu. Reception Michelle Erica Green, writer for TrekNation, said \\"The Haunting of Amphipolis\\" would have made \\"an excellent Halloween episode\\" due to its content. She described it as a highly effective, horror-themed episode, praising Eve's encounter with one of her victims and the dragging of Gabrielle underwater by ghouls. Green also considered many scenes in the episode to \\"pack real power\\", including those in which Xena hallucinates about her mother blaming her for her brother's death and Eve is confronted by the spirits of children she had killed. Xenaville gave the episode 8/10 stars, describing it as a \\"very enjoyable and fast paced adventure\\", giving praise to the use of special effects, the flashback sequences, and Eve's encounters with her victims and Livia. In their book Killing Off the Lesbians: A Symbolic Annihilation on Film and Television, writers Liz Millward, Janice G. Dodd, and Irene Fubara-Manuel single out this episode‚Äîspecifically Xena's almost- replacement of Mephistopheles as ruler in Hell‚Äîas one of many exemplars of the darkening in tone of the sixth season of the series.

The primary awards, the Global Top 10 and Rookie Top 5, are awarded to the top-ten most popular V Live channels, the latter specifically for new artists. Additional popularity awards are selected via online voting. Initially, the fifteen channels held an individual broadcast where they received the award, however, starting in 2019, V Live began presenting the awards at a ceremony entitled V Heartbeat.

The invading army, led by Khusrau Khan and other generals, besieged the Kakatiya capital Warangal. Prataparudra negotiated a truce after a brief siege, agreeing to pay tribute to Delhi.  Background  The Kakatiya kingdom, with its capital at Warangal, had been subdued by the forces of Qutbuddin's father Alauddin in 1310. However, the Kakatiya ruler Prataparudra had stopped making tribute payments to Delhi. Therefore, Mubarak Shah sent an army to subjugate him. The army was led by Khusrau Khan, Khwaja Haji (who had served as Alauddin's minister of war), and Malik Qutlugh (amir-i shikar).  The siege  After reaching near Warangal, Khusrau Khan surveyed the city from the Hanamkonda hill. His initial attack forced the defending garrison to retreat inside the Warangal fort. The invaders then besieged the fort, and set fire to the fort's gate. The fire seems to have failed to achieve the desired results, as the invaders next pitched their tents around the fort. The Delhi army deployed highly advanced military technology by contemporary standards, including several siege engines. At night, Prataparudra's general Diwar Mehta launched an attack on the Delhi camp. However, the attack was repulsed by Ghazi Kamil (governor of Awadh) and Tamar (governor of Chanderi). The Delhi soldiers then climbed up to a tower of the outer fort wall, and captured Prataparudra's minister Anil Mehta in a skirmish. Khusrau Khan spared the captive's life. During the first half of the next day, the invaders captured the outer mud-fort. The invaders then decided to construct a pasheb under the supervision of Malik Ambar and Shihab Arb. At this time, Prataparudra sent his messengers to negotiate peace.  Prataparudra's surrender  As part of the truce negotiations, Prataparudra surrendered over 100 elephants, 12,000 horses, and treasures to the invaders. Khusrau Khan also demanded an annual tribute payment of 60 gold bricks and cessation of five districts (Badarkot, Kailas, Basudan, Elor, and Kobar) from Prataparudra. After negotiations, this demand was reduced to 40 gold bricks and cessation of Badarkot. As a sign of Prataparudra's surrender, the canopy (chatr), baton (durbash), and banner given to him by Alauddin were taken back, and brought back as a gift from Mubarak Shah. Prataparudra paid obeisance to the royal canopy from the ramparts of his fort on three successive mornings. After subduing the Kakatiyas, Khusrau Khan marched to Ellora, where Mubarak Shah had been residing for a month. The rest of the army joined him on the banks of the Narmada River on his way back to Delhi.

The interior design was commissioned by architect Woldemar Brinkmann. The launch took place on 29 March 1938 in the presence of Adolf Hitler. The commissioning took place on 24 March 1939.The Great Ocean Liners: Robert Ley 1939 - 1947 The ship was designed for about 1750 passengers in addition to the crew members. The decks of Robert Ley consisted of: * Command bridge (with cabins for captain and officers) * Sundeck (with library) * Boat deck (with cabins and small lounges) * Promenade deck (with the main company rooms) * A-deck (with cabins, dining rooms with 860 seats and utility rooms) * B deck (with cabins, laundry and hairdresser) * C-deck (with cabins, bakery and butchery) (bulkhead deck) * D-deck (with cabins, hospital, dining room for crew and workshop) * E-deck (with cabins) * F-deck (with swimming pool, luggage room, supplies and provisions, laundry, machine and auxiliary machinery room)  Use until 1945 Until the beginning of World War II on 1 September 1939, the Robert Ley was used as a cruise ship for the Strength Through Joy (Kraft durch Freude) organisation. In May 1939, she sailed together with the KdF ships Wilhelm Gustloff, Stuttgart, Der Deutsche and Sierra Cordoba and the ship Oceana to Vigo, Spain, where the fleet arrived on 24 May and unloaded medical and other materials for the nationalist government. On 26 May, the troops of the Condor Legion came on board, 1416 men on the Robert Ley, returning to Hamburg on 30 May. Shortly before the beginning of the Second World War, the Robert Ley was taken over on 25 August 1939 as a hospital ship by the Kriegsmarine and converted accordingly in Hamburg. Due to a lack of demand, she was decommissioned on 22 November 1939 as a hospital ship and instead, after further conversion was used as living quarters of the 1st Submarine Training Division in Neustadt, assigned from July 1941 at Pillau. From the end of July 1944 she was used as a casualty transport ship in the Baltic Sea, then from September 1944 again as an accommodation ship, this time for the 1st Submarine Training Division in Hamburg-Finkenwerder. After the breakthrough of the Red Army on the Eastern Front, the Robert Ley was used in Operation Hannibal for the evacuation of civilians and wounded from East Prussia. She left Pillau on 25 January 1945. Fate On 9 March 1945, the Robert Ley was in the Port of Hamburg during an air raid on the city by the Royal Air Force. The ship received several bomb hits and burned out completely. The still-floating wreck was still in the harbour basin until June 1947, when it was towed to the UK and scrapped at Inverkeithing.marpubs: 9TH MARCH 1945, HAMBURG BOMBING RAID HITS ROBERT LEY  References  * R.

Her rise to prominence from a humble background has led to her being described as \\"the lass o' pairts\\" as a female counterpoint to the notion of \\"the lad of pairts\\" prevalent in Scottish educational philosophy of the time.  Early life  Isabella Skea was born in the Bridge of Don area of Aberdeen on 16 January 1845. Her parents were tenant farmers; George Chalmers and Isabella Low. Having received encouragement from her schoolmaster, she trained at the Church of Scotland Normal College in Edinburgh circa 1866.  Career  Upon completion of her training, she returned to Aberdeen in 1868 where she became Girls' Head of East Parish Sessional School (this would later be known as St Paul Street Elementary School). Then, when the school expanded in 1896, Skea became the overall Headteacher, the first female head of a large (1,000 pupils) mixed-sex boarding school. She stayed in this role until her retirement from the Aberdeen Board in 1908. Skea was particularly interested in the development of school libraries and opposed teachers receiving payments related to results, deeming the practice educationally unsound. The results achieved by pupils in her charge, however, caused her to be one of the highest paid teachers in Aberdeen by the 1870s. In the 1880s, she campaigned for university education for women, and wrote a series of textbooks entitled the 'Combined Class Series'. In the 1890s, she campaigned for better pay and pension rights for women teachers and supported the introduction of 'fresh air' holidays for children living in Aberdeen's slum areas. Skea was the fifth woman ever to become a Fellow of the Educational Institute of Scotland (EIS) union, the oldest teacher's trade union in the world. The Annual Congress of the Educational Institute of Scotland was held in Aberdeen in 1896. Skea read the final paper of the congress entitled 'The Status of Women in Teaching'. She stated there were three things which women teachers needed to agitate for until they got them: # Higher training. # Freer range. # Better emoluments.  Personal life  She married William Skea, a printer/journalist, on Christmas Day in 1884 but she firmly believed that marriage should not interfere with a women's career. The couple had no children but provided a home for their three nieces.  Death and legacy  Skea died on 7 October 1914 in Aberdeen. Dr. Alison McCall, convenor of Women's History Scotland, described Skea's legacy thus: > We are all familiar with the lad o‚Äôpairts, the clever young man who rose > from lowly origins thanks to the benefits of a good Scottish education. > Isabella Skea rose to prominence by a similar path and demonstrates that > lasses as well as lads could make their own way in the nineteenth century.

It has a single thin leaf fused to the flowering stem and up to ten small, yellowish-green flowers with a hairy reddish labellum. Description Genoplesium sagittiferum is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single thin leaf long and fused to the flowering stem with the free part long. Between two and ten yellowish-green flowers with red streaks are arranged along a flowering stem long and taller than the leaf. The flowers are long and wide and are inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The dorsal sepal is egg-shaped, long, wide and pointed with hairless edges. The lateral sepals are linear to lance-shaped, long, about wide and spread widely apart from each other. The petals are lance-shaped to egg-shaped, about long, wide and sharply pointed with hairless edges. The labellum is reddish, egg-shaped with the narrower end towards the base, about long, wide, with short hairs on its edges. There is a tapered, dark red callus in the centre of the labellum and extending nearly to its tip. Flowering occurs between February and May. Taxonomy and naming The horned midge orchid was first formally described in 1942 by Herman Rupp who gave it the name Prasophyllum sagittiferum. The type specimen was collected near Bell by Erwin Nubling and his wife and the description was published in The Victorian Naturalist. In 1989, David Jones and Mark Clements changed the name to Genoplesium sagittiferum and in 2002 Jones and Clements changed the name again to Corunastylis sagittifera. The specific epithet (sagittiferum) is from the Latin words sagitta meaning \\"arrow\\" and fero meaning \\"to bear\\" or \\"to carry\\" referring to the arrowhead shape of the labellum callus. Distribution and habitat Genoplesium sagittiferum grows with shrubs in sandy soils, sometimes in moss gardens on rock ledges. It is found in the higher parts of the Blue Mountains.

Plans for such a low-cost high speed service were reported in February 2018, with the goal of running by 2019. However, it was held up and new sets of proposals for the service were announced on 11 December 2019, for starting in 6 April 2020. On the 15 March 2020 Renfe announced that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it would be postponing the launch of the service until further notice. Customer who paid a promotional fare of five euro would be offered another journey at a later date, while other customers would be offered a full refund.  History  Based the popularity of the French low- cost high-speed rail service Ouigo that was introduced in 2013 by French national rail company SNCF, and keen to encourage train travel on the Spanish high-speed rail network. Renfe was interested setting up their own such budget service. Initially they created a working idea under the name of \\"eva\\", which is the name of the Renfe's own high-speed train service AVE, spelt backwards. The service was announced on 6 February 2018 by the then Minister of Public Works √ç√±igo de la Serna, and was aimed to be operational by the first quarter of 2019. The plan was initially to travel between from Madrid to less popular AVE stations in the region of Catalonia namely Camp de Tarragona and El Prat de Llobregat (a suburb of Barcelona). This is like how Ouigo go smaller Tourcoing station instead of Lille-Europe. A series of delays meant that Renfe went back to the drawing board, and with the prospect of new competitors including the airline Air Nostrum, the Italian rail company Trenitalia and SNCF with Ouigo coming into the market in late 2020 meant that Renfe had to put the idea back on. So Renfe relaunched their low-cost high-speed service on the 11 December 2019, with the plan of launching during Holy Week 2020. Avlo was set to run between Madrid Atocha station, Zaragoza Delicias and Barcelona Sants stations. A big difference is that instead of stopping in Tarragona, the service will stop at the city of Zaragoza.  Background  The Avlo service would consists of modified purple-coloured Talgo AVE trains. They will use the future Service 106 train with 581 seats, or a Service 112 trains will be upgraded to 438 seats both in all-second class configuration. Renfe has reported it is going to price tickets of the Avlo as low as ‚Ç¨10, compared to the lowest offer of ‚Ç¨48 for the normal AVE ticket for Madrid and Barcelona.

It is the only one of his books published under his real name - Ronald Felton. It is chiefly set in London, but the showdown takes place in South Wales.  Plot The story begins with Anthony Fitzgerald's waking up to discover he is chained to a sink in a factory bathroom somewhere in London, with no memory of how he ended up here. The other prisoner is David Blackwell, who is equally confused. Both men are criminals - Anthony represents a Welsh burglary gang and David a London gang of fences - and had arranged to meet in order to exchange an extremely valuable diamond necklace stolen in Cardiff for money. Both the money and the necklace are now missing, and both men, after initially accusing the other of robbing them, realise that they must work together in order to discover who set them both up. Both men call their respective bosses (Anthony's is his own brother Alun), and are told that if they do not recover the money/necklace, they will not have a pleasant ending. With this, the duo begin retracing their steps from the previous day. The last thing that both men remember was meeting in a pub for the exchange. Going to the pub, they intimidate a frightened bar girl into admitting that she was paid to spike their drinks, under the mistaken belief that this was a practical joke being played upon the duo by their friends. The description she gives them of the man who paid her to do this is of a one-eyed man in a Provincial Railways uniform with a strong Welsh accent. The men go to Paddington Station, but have no luck with their enquiries. However, one train guard meeting this description flees as he sees both men, boarding a sleeper train leaving the platform for Penzance. Fitzgerald and Blackwell jump on the train as well, and pursue the man through the train. A fight takes place at the end of the train, and the guard is shot by Blackwell, collapsing against the door and half falling out of the train. They force the guard at gunpoint, as he clings to the door, to tell them where he took the jewels, and he subsequently does (while sneering at Fitzgerald's foolishness), giving them a phone number to call for his contact in Bridgend, near where Anthony's boss lives. Once he has given this information up, Blackwell kicks him fully out of the speeding train. The two men subsequently travel to Bridgend, and phone the number from a local phonebox, and, impersonating the guard, tell the man on the other end of the line that there is a problem. The voice tells them to come to the gang's headquarters nearby at Sker House. When the duo arrive, the house seems empty, and the rest of the gang is absent. They do however encounter Alun in his office, who holds them at gunpoint. He opens his safe to show them both the necklace and the money. He explains that Anthony was becoming too powerful in the gang and was commanding too much respect, and this was his intended way of disposing of him. As he prepares to shoot them, Anthony charges him down, knocking the gun out of his hand, but being shot in the shoulder in doing this. David then uses his own gun to execute Alun. Anthony explains that his wound is not too serious, and David agrees, saying \\"that's the problem\\" and then shoots Anthony dead. He retrieves both the necklace and the money, and leaves the house whistling. The schoolboys Peter and Gwyn, the protagonists of Welch's award- winning novel The Gauntlet, make a cameo appearance in this book explaining to an irate ticket collector that they have lost their tickets.

As the McDonnell Douglas DC-10, the aircraft operating the flight was approaching the airport, it collided with the ALS system 500 feet short from the runway threshold. This critically damaged the frontal gear, collapsing it. The aircraft came to a rest 300 feet before the runway. Although all 168 onboard survived, the plane was written off. This accident was the first hull loss of the DC-10. Aircraft and Crew The aircraft operating was a McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30, manufactured in early 1973 by McDonnell Douglas at Long Beach Airport, California. At the time of the accident, it was nine months old and flown a total of 2,016 flight hours. It was registered as N54627 during a certification test but re-registered as EC-CBN when it was delivered to Iberia Airlines in August 1973. Once, it was photographed previously for Iberia Airlines postcards and merchandise. Investigation The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigated the cause of the accident after its occurrence. According to the aircraft's flight data recorder, it explained that its descent rate was increasing too rapidly during the approach, the result of a wind shear encounter. It was discovered that the captain and the first officer failed to recognize the rate change until the aircraft collided with the ALS piers. It was also discovered that the changes in weather had directed their attention away from monitoring the descent rate. 11 months after the accident in 1974, the NTSB confirmed their probable cause of the crash. In the accident report, in a statement, it claims \\"The captain did not recognize and may have been unable to recognize, an increased rate of descent in time to arrest it before the aircraft struck the approach light piers. The increased rate of descent was induced by an encounter with low- level wind shear at a critical point in the landing approach where he was transitioning from automatic flight control under instrument flight conditions to manual flight control with visual references. The captain's ability to detect and arrest the increased rate of descent was adversely affected by a lack of information as to the existence of the wind shear and the marginal visual cues available. The minimal DC-10 wheel clearance above the approach lights and the runway threshold afforded by the ILS glide slope made the response time critical and, under the circumstances, produced a situation wherein a pilot's ability to make a safe landing was greatly diminished.\\" The DC-10 had eight emergency exits, but after the crash, only four could be operated. The number 1 right exit had a fault in the mechanism and could not be opened. Due to the weak floor at the end of the aircraft, the floor had become deformed, causing failures in multiple-seat tracks and restraints, and also destroyed the two emergency exits at the back of the aircraft. This meant that the passengers in the back had to climb out of the section through the roof that had broken and jump off onto the ground, causing even more injuries. Due to the floor disintegrating, rock and mud were thrown into the rear compartment of the aircraft. The parts of the floor that had broken apart were between fuselage stations (sections in the aircraft fuselage) 1530 to 1850. Compared to American Airlines Flight 96, stations 1801 to 1921 had failed. The same floor section had collapsed in both crashes. Aftermath The NTSB issued seven safety recommendations to the Federal Aviation Administration on September 6, 1974.

Before his appointment as minister, he had worked for the Indonesian Ministry of Public Works for nine years. Basuki was born in Surakarta, his father was a member of the Indonesian Army. After obtaining his bachelor's from Gadjah Mada University in 1979, he moved into the ministry of public works and began his career there. Later, he obtained his master's and doctorate from Colorado State University. He raised up the ranks and served as inspector-general and director-general there, until he accepted an appointment from Joko Widodo to serve as minister after over 30 years as a public servant on 2014. Due to Widodo's infrastructure programs, Basuki's ministry received significant portions of the budget during his tenure, measuring Rp 107.3 trillion (US$ 7.5 billion) for the 2018 fiscal year. Projects under his tenure included mass construction of public housing, road infrastructure and water reservoirs. Early life Basuki was born in Surakarta on 5 November 1954, as the fourth son of a soldier in the Indonesian Army with seven siblings. As a child, he would move often due to his father's stationing. He completed his elementary school in Palembang, middle school in Papua, and high school in Surabaya. =Family= He is married to Kartika Nurani and the couple has three children‚ÄìDewi (born 1987), Neil (born 1992) and Dira (born 1994). =Early education= During his high school period, he was active in school bands and played the drum. After completing high school at SMA Negeri 5 Surabaya (id), he was admitted into Gadjah Mada University where he studied engineering geology. He graduated from there in 1979, at age 25. Career After graduating from UGM, Basuki landed a job at the ministry of public works as a civil servant. After several years, he obtained a scholarship from the ministry to resume his studies, and obtained both a master's and a doctorate from Colorado State University at ages 35 and 38, respectively. Following his continued studies, he returned to Indonesia and continued his work at the ministry, receiving an award as the ministry's employee of the year in 1995. Later on, he was promoted to be the head of the ministry's research and development body between 2005 and 2007. After this, he became the ministry's inspector general until 2013. The last position he held prior to his ministerial appointment in October 2014 was director-general of spatial planning. During his time at the ministry, he had participated in several national-level working groups including ones related to rehabilitation following the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami in Aceh, handling of the Sidoarjo mud flow (2006‚Äì2007), reparation of the Purbaleunyi Toll Road and management of food scarcity in Yahukimo Regency (both in 2006). In May 2012, Basuki was also appointed as the chief commissioner at Wijaya Karya, a state- owned construction company. He also served as a vice president of the International Commission on Irrigation and Drainage for the 2013-2016 tenure. Cabinet minister On 26 October 2014, newly elected president Joko Widodo announced the appointment of Basuki as the minister of public works and public housing. The ministry was formed from a merger of the Ministry of Public Works and the Ministry of Public Housing, previously headed by Djoko Kirmanto and Djan Faridz respectively. Like other ministers, he resigned from his corporate work at Wijaya Karya upon appointment. He was one of the five Gadjah Mada University alumni in the cabinet lineup (excluding Widodo himself), and had a reported asset of Rp 6.5 billion (about US$ 500,000) in 2012. Less than two months after becoming minister, Basuki agreed to provide a USD 62 million loan to compensate the victims of the Sidoarjo mud flow after getting in contact with the Bakrie Group. The company was given 4 years to pay off the debt, or face a government takeover of their assets (largely land). In 2016, he was also summoned by the Corruption Eradication Commission to serve as a witness regarding a graft case in his ministry. In the first year under him the ministry received a IDR 33 trillion increase of funding between a draft and a revised budget plan ‚Äì receiving the largest such increase compared to other ministries. While it only used about 8% of its IDR 118 trillion (USD 8.94 billion) annual budget within the first five months, by the end of that year the number increased to 94.5%. The ministry received the most funding compared to other ministries in 2016, while in the 2017 and 2018 budgets the ministry was second behind the Ministry of Defence. The ministry's budget for the 2018 fiscal year was set at IDR 107.3 trillion. Basuki retained his ministerial position in the 2019 Onward Indonesia Cabinet. =Projects=Moving the capital In 2017, the People's Representative Council revoked funding for capital-moving studies in the ministry's budget. Basuki described the capital's possible future movement from Jakarta as a \\"political decision\\", and that the move \\"is not easy\\" with the ministry only having done literature studies instead of macro planning. He added that such a move might take four to five years in preparation. People's Consultative Assembly speaker Zulkifli Hasan has called for a delay in the move, citing its major cost amidst major infrastructure projects. Basuki also pointed out that Palangkaraya would not be the only option, if such a move was made. Public housing Joko Widodo launched a plan to construct 1 million public houses as part of 10 million affordable housing by 2019‚Äìof which about 600,000 will be constructed from the ministry's budget. In implementation, the program received various complaints regarding the project speed to the slow response of permits from local governments. According to Basuki, about 700,000 of the houses had been completed by October 2017. Infrastructure In the 2016 ministry budget, construction of roads and bridges received the largest share followed by water resources. The Indonesian government set plans to construct 1,000 km of toll roads within Widodo's first 5-year tenure alongside 2,650 km of national roads. This included completion of the Trans-Java Toll Road and the initiation of the Trans-Sumatra Toll Road, in addition to the Trans Papua road‚Äìwhich according to Basuki was planned to reach 4,300 km in length by 2019. A toll road was also initiated between the cities of Manado and Bitung in North Sulawesi. The ministry also planned on constructing 49 dams to provide water resources between 2014 and 2019. Awards For his 30 years of service in the Ministry of Public Works, Basuki was awarded the three Satyalencana Karya medals. He was also awarded the Satyalencana Pembangunan and Satyalencana Wirakarya medal in 2003 and 2005 respectively, in addition to Satyalencana Kesejahteraan Sosial for his work in Aceh following the tsunami.

Before Carach Angren, Wijers played with Dark Mutation and then Vaultage where he met Dennis \\"Seregor\\" Droomers and they began Carach Angren as a side project, when the two connected over a shared love of horror and storytelling. Later Vaultage disbanded when Carach Angren became increasingly successful.  Biography  Clemens is the older brother of Carach Angren's former drummer Ivo \\"Namtar\\" Wijers. He first started playing piano at the age of 7 and played with a local youth choir throughout his teen years. He grew interested in metal in his secondary school years and joined a band as a way of combining his new interest with his classical background. He also studied music at the Tilburg Conservatory in 2002 before forming Vaultage in 2003, and later co-forming Carach Angren. He has also completed a certificate in Cinematic Orchestration, taught by William Boston. Wijers has mentioned that he is a fan of orchestral soundtracks from films and video games, and that he was a big gamer in the 1990s who loved video game soundtracks.  Musical Work  Alongside Carach Angren, Wijers has also released a solo album titled \\"Worlds\\" that is mainly a combination of industrial and classical music tracks. He has composed the soundtrack for a number of short films, including Firefly and the Coffee Machine by John Michael Wilyat; an animated short about a series of drawings by an eight-year- old girl coming to life. He also wrote music on Lindemann's album \\"Skills in Pills,\\" and has written music for Pain and Ex Deo. He also offers piano lessons through his website. Typically, Wijers writes the composition for Carach Angren's music while bandmate Dennis \\"Seregor\\" Droomers writes the lyrics and stories. = Discography = Solo  * Worlds (2017)  Carach Angren  * The Chase Vault Tragedy (2004) * Ethereal Veiled Existence (2005) * Lammendam (2008) * Death Came Through a Phantom Ship (2010) * Where the Corpses Sink Forever (2012) * This is no Fairytale (2015) * Dance and Laugh Amongst the Rotten (2017)  Other  * Vaultage: Hallucinate Beyond (2003, keyboard and lyrics) * Vredehammer : Pans skygge (2011, composition of first song on EP) * Bodyfarm : Battle Breed (2015, composition of eleventh song) * Lindemann : Skills in Pills (2015, orchestral composition and background vocals) * Pain : Coming Home (2016, composition) * Ex Deo : The Immortal Wars (2017, composition) * Utbyrd : Varskrik (2017, composition)  See also  * Carach Angren * Dennis \\"Seregor\\" Droomers  External links  * Official Website * Solo Music: Available on Bandcamp * Carach Angren Website * Official Facebook  References  __INDEX__ 1983 births Dutch heavy metal keyboardists Dutch keyboardists Dutch pianists Dutch composers Dutch songwriters Black metal musicians Season of Mist artists Living people 21st-century pianists ","title":"Clemens Wijers"},{"id":"56544282","title":"Ramachandran Durairaj"},{"id":"56544293","text":"Lottehof, Lottestra√üe 8-10 Das Lottehaus (2011) The Lottehaus is a museum in Wetzlar, Germany.

The Lottehaus was originally an establishment of the Teutonic Order, which founded it in 1285 under the name Haus Wetzlar as its principal office in the city of Wetzlar. Over the years the establishment was extended by several buildings and the actual Lottehaus was constructed in 1653 to house the local curator of the order.

Penny was discovered in a Johannesburg recording studio by producer Joe Shirimani, who was impressed by Penny's unique vocal style. Shirimani's record label Shandel Music enjoyed the demos he produced for Penny, and let the pair record an album together. Recorded over the space of one week using an Atari computer, Korg M1 synthesiser and reel-to-reel tape, the album blends the Tsonga disco style of music with American house music, reflecting the popularity of American and British electronic dance music in South Africa. It has been credited for pioneering a new style of Tsonga disco with its fusion of slow house rhythms, synthesised steel drums and Penny's modern vocal style atop traditional call-and-response female backing vocals. Released on cassette by Shandel Music, Shaka Bundu was a success in South Africa, selling over 250,000 copies in the country and being certified double platinum. Its success was surprising, given that its lyrics are in the obscure Xishangana variation of the Tsonga language. The album established Penny Penny as a pop star and also helped improve opinion on Xitsonga music among Tsonga people, as well as establishing Shirimani as a noted producer. Though Penny fell into obscurity in the 2000s, American record label Awesome Tapes From Africa re-released the album worldwide in 2013, which gave Penny a renewed popularity. He began playing live again and recording new music as a result of the success of the re-release. Background and recording Penny Penny (real name Giyani Kulani) was born in Limpopo in 1962 and was the youngest of 68 children from a local doctor with 25 wives. His family was poor, meaning he never had schooling, but he soon became known for his dancing and was nicknamed Penny. In the 1980s, he began creating music he described as a fusion of African music, breakdance and the musical style of Michael Jackson. Aged 19, he worked on a West Driefontein goldmine near Carletonville, where he won breakdancing trophies, but he soon returned home to escape the region's poor working conditions. He supported his music by working in mines and opening a restaurant. Penny was determined to make a connection with the South African music industry, and in the 1990s this meant he began working as a janitor in a Johannesburg recording studio belonging to South African musician Selwyn Shandel. He had nowhere to sleep so he would hide in the studio overnight and clean it, so that the owners could open it in the morning to find it cleaned. During his shifts, he would discreetly teach himself how to operate the recording equipment. During one of Penny's shifts in 1994, he approached Afrobeat/Tsonga disco producer Joseph Shirimani, who was working in the studio with another artist, and asked to work with him. Shirimani asked if Penny could sing, at which point, as Shirimani recalls, \\"[h]e didn't say yes. He just sang a song for me. And that's when I heard this unusual voice and those melodies.\\" Impressed by his tuneful yet raspy singing, Shirimani agreed to produce material for Penny. The producer's colleagues were initially unsure of the singer, who they saw as more of a comedian than a performer, but Shirimani nonetheless produced three demos for Penny, one of which, \\"Shaka Bundu\\", was inspired by a friend who badmouthed the singer to the latter's wife and then proposed to her. The three demos that the pair had created greatly impressed Shirimain's colleagues and Shandel Music, the label to which Shirimani was affiliated, and the label let Shirimani produce a whole album for Penny, also titled Shaka Bundu, which they recorded in only a week. Shirimani produced the album and played keyboards, whilst Penny sung the lyrics. The album's female backing vocalists were later named the Shaka Bundu girls, who subsequently released their own album of music as a group. Further backing vocals from the singer Mpomi appear on \\"Shichangani\\" and \\"Dance Khomela\\". The album's re-release credits Fraser Lesotho for engineering and David Soloele for mixing. Composition The music on Shaka Bundu fuses the Tsonga disco (or Shangaan disco) style ‚Äì which originated from the Tsonga culture in northern South Africa ‚Äì with contemporary house music from the United States. The house influence reflects the popularity of English and American dance-club hits in South Africa, which proved to the country's musicians that a contemporary sound need not be achieved by sophisticated instruments, but instead with \\"plucky small studios and canny producers,\\" thus bringing about a technological revolution in the music the country produced. Penny Penny cited Londonbeat's 1991 hit \\"I've Been Thinking About You\\" as an influence, while one writer also wrote of the possible influence from Soul II Soul, not just in the music but in Penny's hairstyle, which is reminiscent to that of Jazzie B. The album possesses a rough, yet sufficiently hooky feel, with Penny's \\"gruff\\" voice offering an unlikely accompaniment to the music. A Korg M1 synthesiser is used throughout the album. The music is provided by Shirimani, who was inspired by Chicago house in particular and blends the genre's deep bass and harsh piano, as was typified by the music of Larry Heard and Marshall Jefferson, with South African melodies. The call and response vocals on the album are also a distinctly South African characteristic. The majority of the songs run at 100bpm and were recorded using a reel-to-reel tape, an Atari computer and a Korg M1 synthesiser. Distinctive of Shirimani's production is a static bass line which displays the root tones of an organ, albeit with a \\"peculiar richness and depth.\\" Fact Magazine described the album's musical style as \\"good-time house,\\" comparing it to Inner City, albeit with \\"some added springbok flavour,\\" while future collaborator Brian Shimkovitz described Shaka Bundu as a synth-pop album. Penny presents a party vibe throughout the album that was described by NPR as \\"hearty but not frantic, more plain sexy than raunchy.\\" The songs are in the Tsonga or Xitsonga language, or more specifically its Limpopo-region dialect Xihlanganu, one of the least-heard languages in South Africa. Penny explained: \\"When I made the demo everyone was like 'Na na na na na, don't like this.' But I wanted to introduce my language to the world.\\" By using the Xitsonga language and its \\"music-like linguistic flavors,\\" Penny and Shirimani highlight their ethnic Tsonga identity. The lyrics are joyous and spiritually call for positive vibes. Shimkovitz credits the album's rising and falling, slow tempo house rhythms and synthesised steel drum sounds, as well as Penny applying his rap-like vocal delivery atop the otherwise iconic Tsonga musical style of female call-and-response vocals, as creating a new style of Tsonga disco. =Songs= Opening song \\"Shichangani\\" has been described as a highlight example of Tsonga disco by one writer, who felt it departed from the low-budget, repetitious sounding nature of most songs in the genre and thus introduces the album's inventive variations upon Tsonga disco. The title track was referred to by Shirimani as among the first songs to mix traditional South African melodies with dance-pop. Rolling Stone called it \\"an example of Tsonga (or Shangaan) Afro-disco\\" and wrote that it \\"updated traditional African music with synthesizers, electric guitars, and disco or house beats.\\" The Guardian described the song as Afrobeat. It was written about a friend of Penny's who proposed to Penny's girlfriend of eight years after she dumped him when he lost his job, and gives the album its name, a local term for \\"bad guy\\". \\"Ndzhihere Bhi\\" contains new wave-styled guitar figures reminiscent of the Cure. The only song to run at a faster tempo is \\"Dance Khomela\\", which contains elements of Italo house and has been compared to Jinny's hit \\"Keep Warm\\". Release Shaka Bundu was released in 1994 by Shandel Music as a cassette in South Africa. The title track, \\"Shaka Bundu\\", was released as a single and became both a local sensation and a huge hit throughout South Africa. Shaka Bundu was also huge commercial success in the country, where it topped the South African Albums Chart, and sold 250,000 copies. It was ultimately certified double platinum, and remains the best- selling album of Tsonga music ever. Several songs from the album had music videos, including one for the title track. The nationwide success of Shaka Bundu was surprising, as it was entirely in the little-spoken Tsonga language, which had a difficult time breaking out. Shrimani was very surprised first and foremost by the success of the single: \\"Jesus, it was unbelievable. Some people don't know how to speak that language ‚Äî it's a small nation. But it became a hit. The combination of traditional melodies with dance pop, that was something new.\\" Penny explained his usage of the language on the album in retrospect: Until the release of Shaka Bundu, Tsonga music was dominated by Paul Ndlovu, who had a hit with \\"Ts'akane,\\" and the late Peta Teanet, and Tsonga disco was still only accepted within the Northern Province. Shrimani recalled: \\"Shangaan people suffered from an inferiority complex and didn't want to be seen playing Shangaan music in their homes.\\" The release of Shaka Bundu helped change this attitude, and introduced Shrimani as a new talent. He became recognised for his Tsonga music productions and was swamped with requests from others to work with him. As a pop star, Penny was visually distinguished by his hairstyle, which contained elaborate topknots. He toured relentlessly throughout South Africa to make a living, as piracy permeated the country's record industry, with every one of three CDs in South Africa being said to be a pirated copy. He recorded several further albums, including Laphinda Shangaan (1997) and Makanjta Jive (1998), which both outsold Shaka Bundu in the region. Despite his national success, he was never distributed outside of South Africa, and soon drifted into obscurity as the country's music trends moved on. Western rediscovery and re-release In April 2010, American DJ and ethno-musicologist Brian Shimkovitz posted the music from Shaka Bundu onto his blog Awesome Tapes from Africa (which specialised in posting music from rare African cassettes) with the description: \\"The tape contains simple yet deep synth-pop anthems that couldn‚Äôt give a fuck if you thought they sounded corny at first. It‚Äôs that kind of tape.\\" Shimkovitz had only recently heard the cassette and became obsessed, enjoying it for standing out within Tsonga disco due to Penny's distinctive raspy vocals and joyous songs and Shirimani's unique, American club music-influenced production. He also played material from the album on his Awesome Tapes from Africa DJ sets around the United States, Europe, Canada and Australia, where audiences greeted it with what he described as overwhelming positive reaction. When the blog started a record label, also named Awesome Tapes From Africa, Shimkovitz hoped to re-release the album on the label and tried to contact Penny Penny, but could not locate him, despite even travelling to South Africa on his search and asking people where he could be found. He eventually found Penny three years later, discovering he was by then working in the African National Congress as a council member. When the two spoke on the phone, Penny agreed to let Shimkovitz re-release the album. The singer was surprised to contacted by Shimkovitz. He said: \\"I never think this album can take me to America. Even now, I can't believe people there like it. To me it's like a dream.\\" Shimkowitz and Penny agreed to cut their profits 50/50 from the re-release, and the singer flew to the United States for the re-release's launch. In September 2013, the label released several songs, including \\"Shichangani\\", as free downloads. These tracks proved popular with online audiences, especially Spanish listeners. The label re-released Shaka Bundu on vinyl, CD, cassette and as a download on 12 November 2013. The re-release was worldwide, and Shimkovitz hoped its wider exposure would help generate enough interest for Penny Penny to secure him some live performances abroad. Milo Miles of NPR felt the re-release exemplified the larger trend of Western labels bringing vintage African pop to new audiences. The album's re-release caused Penny to once again become a \\"global cult music sensation\\" and allow him to make profits from his music outside South Africa, where piracy had continued to permeate record sales. He explained: \\"I believe everything is in the hands of the gods ‚Äì 'In the day, in the time, something good is going to happen for you, Penny Penny'.\\" Penny was pleased to see the album was popular with audiences in Africa and Australia. He had been shocked to hear his music had been popular in Australia for many years and organisers there had been trying to contact him for six years. =Reception and aftermath= Among reviews of the re-release, Stewart Smith of The List rated the album four out of five and noted that, as a Tsonga/Shangaan disco album, it may appeal to those who enjoy the Shangaan electro style of Tshetsha Boys and Nozinja, a genre he felt was a more frenetically paced successor to Tsonga disco. He nonetheless wrote: \\"Shaka Bundu is not just of historical interest, however. Music this joyful, melodic and danceable will always be relevant.\\" Fact Magazine wrote that the album boasts \\"a pleasantly rough feel, but Penny and his producer Joe Shirimani keep things sufficiently hooky and beefy to impress. Really corking stuff, in short.\\" They further made note of Shaka Bundu as being \\"one of the most country‚Äôs most feted house albums,\\" while Sowetan LIVE called it a \\"seminal album.\\" Anton Spice of The Vinyl Factory called the album \\"Penny Penny‚Äôs definitive Shangaan Disco record.\\" The re-release allowed Penny Penny to revive his musical career, and he began playing a string of international live shows, including at Tin Pan Alley, New York City, in May 2014, where he performed with a ten-piece band, and at the Sydney Opera House a month later. He released a new album, Siyayi Vuma, in 2016. He also starred in his own Mzansi Magic reality show, Papa Penny Ahee!, in 2017. The surge in Penny's popularity led Rolling Stone to compare him to Sixto Rodriguez, an American folk singer who had South African success but was thought to have died until the documentary Searching for Sugar Man corrected the myth and bought Rodriguez attention in America.

The film is noteworthy for early appearances of several well-known British actors, including Timothy Spall, Lisa Maxwell and John Altman, and it was Gary Oldman's film debut. It was an early production from Channel Four Films and was shown in the first week of Channel 4 broadcasting. It was also one of the first films in the UK to be shown on television less than three years after its initial cinema release (a delay enforced at the time by the Cinema Exhibitors' Association).  Plot  The film does not have a linear plot, but rather cuts between the interweaving stories of several characters, as they prepare for the coming months away at sea. The action centres around the bars and clubs of the Union Street district of Plymouth. One major event that affects all the characters is the hospitalisation, and eventual death, of Daniel (Gary Oldman) after a violent assault by a nightclub bouncer.  Production  Gregg got the idea for the film from his own experiences as a student at Plymouth Art College. It was largely shot on location, including interior scenes in two Union Street pubs, The Phoenix and The Two Trees. The film was commissioned by Channel 4, before the channel had started broadcasting, and was aired in the first week of the new channel in early November 1982, close to Remembrance Sunday. Unusually for the time, the film had been given a cinema preview in June 1982 at the Screen on the Hill cinema in Hampstead. This was a purely opportunistic enterprise, taking advantage of the prominent role that the Royal Navy had played in the Falklands War to gain publicity for the film (and the upcoming launch of Channel 4), but it turned out to be a significant event in the relationship between cinema and television in the UK.

Family background and early life  Lydia Flood Jackson in 1887. Lydia Flood was born in Brooklyn, California now annexed to Oakland, California. Her mother was Elizabeth Thorn Scott and her father was Isaac Flood. Elizabeth Thorn Scott was born in 1828 in New York and educated in New Bedford, Massachusetts. She moved to California during the Gold Rush with husband Joseph Scott, who shortly died after settling, forcing her to raise their son Oliver alone. In the 1850s, African American children were banned from attending public school so Scott took it upon herself to establish Sacramento's first school for black children in her home on May 29, 1854. The school was accepted into Sacramento's school district but without funding and only as a segregated school. She taught here until she married Flood's father, Isaac Flood. Flood's father Isaac Flood was born a slave in South Carolina in 1816. He bought his freedom and moved west to California during the Gold Rush where he worked as a laborer and tradesman. Lydia Flood Jackson circa 1880s. Elizabeth Thorn Scott and Isaac Flood married in 1855 and moved to Oakland. They were among the earliest African American residents and were a prominent family. Isaac Flood made a fortune on real estate in the area and they both were advocates of African American civil rights and education. They also helped create Shiloh African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church in 1858. In 1857, they had a son named George Francis Flood who is considered \\"the first colored child\\" born in Oakland. The same year, Scott established another private school from their home at 1334 East 15th Street for African Americans and non-white children, including Lydia Flood. Isaac Flood was dedicated to the advancement of civil rights for African Americans and was part of the California Colored Convention Movement to fight segregation in California schools. Because of his advocacy, Lydia Flood was the first African American student to attend integrated John Swett School in 1872. She continued her schooling at night classes at Oakland High School. However, according to the 1940 census, she listed her highest education as 6th grade. After completing her schooling, she married William Jackson.  Activism  Lydia Flood Jackson continued her family's legacy to fight for African American civil rights and was a champion of women's rights. She was an active clubwoman, and first legislative chair and first citizenship chair of the California Federation of Colored Women's Clubs. She also implemented the use of secret ballots in the club's elections. She was a member of the Fannie Jackson Coppin Club for forty-two years and the Native Daughter's Club. She called for women's suffrage at the first meeting of the State Federation of Colored Women's Clubs, which was held in 1918 in Los Angeles. She also acknowledged the suffragists who paved the way and made reference to Oakland's namesake oak trees, saying: \\"Who can break through a phalanx of determined, noble-minded, upright women, backed by the power of the Holy Spirit? Suffrage stands out as one of the component factors of democracy; suffrage is one of the most powerful levers by which we hope to elevate our women to the highest planes of life...Lucretia Mott, Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton saw by an eye of faith this gleaming field sixty years ago, and their determination, true judgement and executive ability has made it possible for you and me to sit in the shade of the Suffrage Oak, a grand old tree, whose branches will soon top every State in the Union.\\" Lydia Flood Jackson's lived at 2319 Myrtle later in life. She was a political activist and even traveled to Mexico, South America and the West Indies for lectures. Jackson wanted women to question their conventional roles and the limitations of societal norms. She also wanted women to examine and interrogate white male supremacy.  Business  Lydia Flood Jackson was a businesswoman and inventor. She learned from her father how to invest in real estate which allowed her to support herself.

The victims were accused of being members of the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) by authorities. An investigation by Myanmar's military concluded on 10 January 2018 that there was indeed a mass execution of Rohingyas in Inn Din, marking the first instance where the military admitted to extrajudicial killings during their \\"clearance operations\\" in the region.  Background  The Rohingya people are an ethnic minority that mainly live in the northern region of Rakhine State, Myanmar, and have been described as one of the world's most persecuted minorities. In modern times, the persecution of Rohingyas in Myanmar dates back to the 1970s. Since then, Rohingya people have regularly been made the target of persecution by the government and nationalist Buddhists. The tension between various religious groups in the country had often been exploited by the past military governments of Myanmar. According to Amnesty International, the Rohingya have suffered from human rights violations under past military dictatorships since 1978, and many have fled to neighbouring Bangladesh as a result. In 2005, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees had assisted with the repatriation of Rohingyas from Bangladesh, but allegations of human rights abuses in the refugee camps threatened this effort. In 2015, 140,000 Rohingyas remained in IDP camps after communal riots in 2012. On 9 October 2016, insurgents of the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) launched their first large-scale attack on Burmese border posts on the Bangladesh‚ÄìMyanmar border, with a second large-scale attack on 25 August 2017, leading to new \\"clearance operations\\" by the Myanmar government, which critics argued targeted civilians.  Prelude  After ARSA's attacks on 25 August 2017, a troop of around 80 Burmese soldiers arrived in Inn Din on 27 August to recruit local Rakhine Buddhist villagers for \\"local security\\". Members of the Tatmadaw (armed forces), the Border Guard Police (BGP) and the local Rakhine community began torching Rohingya homes, whilst keeping Rakhine homes intact. The destruction in Inn Din was confirmed by satellite evidence obtained before and after 28 August. Several hundred Rohingya villagers fled from the west hamlet of Inn Din to the mountains in the east, many with the intent to escape to refugee camps in Bangladesh.  Massacre  On 1 September, many of the villagers who were hiding in the mountains began descending to the beaches of Inn Din in search of food. Armed soldiers and paramilitary members arrived and detained ten men at the beach, whom they accused of being members of ARSA. According to local Rakhine eyewitnesses, the men were moved to the village school at around 5:00 pm, photographed, given a change of clothes, and fed what was to be their last meal. The next morning, on 2 September, the men were photographed again by the military, kneeling on the ground. They were then marched up a hill and shot in the head by soldiers. Soe Chay, a retired soldier and local who supposedly helped dig the mass grave, told Reuters that each victim was shot two to three times. According to Chay, some of the victims managed to survive and made noises whilst being buried alive, prompting a group of local paramilitaries to hack them to death with machetes.  Victims  The victims were all villagers from Inn Din and included fishermen, an Islamic teacher, and two high school students. * Abulu (17), high school pupil * Rashid Ahmed (18), high school pupil * Abul Hashim (25), shopkeeper, father-of-three * Nur Mohammed (29), farmer-fishmonger * Abdul Malik (30), village imam, father-of-five * Dil Mohammed (35), fishmonger, father-of-one * Shoket Ullah (35), fisherman, partially deaf * Habizu (40), farmer-fishmonger, father-of-three * Abdul Majid (45), grocer-farmer, father- of-eight * Shaker Ahmed (45), fishmonger, father-of-nine  Military investigation  Through a Facebook post by Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, the Tatmadaw (armed forces) announced they would investigate reports of a mass grave in the village of Inn Din. On 10 January 2018, the military released their findings in the investigation through a second Facebook post by Min Aung Hlaing. The post stated that there was indeed a mass grave in Inn Din containing bodies of Rohingyas, but that no massacre took place and that those in the grave were \\"Bengali terrorists\\" that soldiers had detained in the village cemetery. According to the post, the Rohingyas in the grave were executed by security forces on 2 September 2017, after they were determined to be \\"Bengali terrorists\\". This was the first time the military acknowledged extrajudicial killings perpetrated by soldiers during their \\"clearance operations\\" in the region. A statement on behalf of the military was posted by Min Aung Hlaing to his Facebook page on 10 April 2018, announcing that seven soldiers had been convicted of murder for their participation in the executions and sentenced to ten years in prison with hard labour in a \\"remote area\\". However, they were all released from prison less than a year into their sentences.  Arrest of Reuters journalists  Myanmar police officers stand on guard outside a courtroom in Insein Township during Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo's trial. On 12 December 2017, members of Myanmar's police force arrested Reuters journalists Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo at a restaurant in Yangon after inviting them to dinner. The pair was charged with possessing classified documents in violation of the colonial-era Official Secrets Act, which carries a possible sentence of 14 years in prison. The two journalists were independently investigating the mass grave found in Inn Din prior to their arrest. A police witness, Moe Yan Naing, later testified that their arrest was a case of entrapment, and that their arrest was intended to intimidate journalists. After the court held its final preliminary hearing of their case, on 8 February 2018, Reuters released all the findings in their journalists' investigation. On 3 September 2018, the two journalists were found guilty by a court and sentenced to seven years in prison, despite international criticism. An appeal was filed on 5 November 2018 by the journalists' lawyers. On 7 May 2019, the two reporters were freed after a pardon by President Win Myint. Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo have received international awards for their reporting of the Inn Din massacre, and were included in Time magazine's Person of the Year 2018, which recognised persecuted journalists as \\"guardians\\" in a \\"war on truth\\".  Government responses  : Prior to Reuters' publication, Myanmar government spokesman Zaw Htay responded to the alleged abuses at Inn Din by saying that the government would investigate them if there was \\"strong and reliable primary evidence\\". After the publication was released, Zaw Htay announced that the government would take \\"action according to the law\\" against the perpetrators of the massacre, but noted that it was not a response to the publication. Burmese authorities later investigated the Rakhine village administrator who spoke with Reuters. The office of the President of Myanmar announced on 13 February 2018 that 16 suspects had been detained in connection to the massacre. Among them were four military officers, three Tatmadaw soldiers, three policemen, and six villagers. Seven of the suspects were later found guilty of murder. : Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, spoke to the U.N. Security Council on 13 February 2018, calling the Myanmar government's denial of the massacre \\"preposterous\\" and the restrictions on travel in Rakhine State a deliberate act to \\"prevent access to an organisation that might bear witness to their [security forces'] atrocities\\". Haley also called for the release of the two Reuters journalists who were allegedly imprisoned for their coverage of the massacre. After charges were brought against the two Reuters journalists, the American embassy in Yangon expressed its disappointment, urging authorities to \\"allow the journalists to return to their jobs and families\\" and calling the decision \\"a setback for press freedom and the rule of law in Myanmar\\".
