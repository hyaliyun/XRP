Hoss was most notable for being an Indiana Superintendent of Public Instruction and the Kansas State Normal School's (KSN) second president. Biography Early life and education Hoss' parents, Jacob and Jane Kinney Hoss, moved his family to Indiana in 1836, twelve years after Hoss was born in 1824. Hoss attended Indiana Asbury University, where he graduated in 1850 and 1853. Principal, professor, state educator After graduating college, Hoss became the principal at Muncie Academy, located in Muncie, Indiana, from 1850 to 1852. After leaving Muncie Academy, he then went to serve as a professor of mathematics at the Indiana Females College in Indianapolis, Indiana from 1852 to 1856 before leaving to become a professor at Butler University from 1856 to 1864. In 1864, Hoss became the eighth superintendent of the Indiana Department of Education. He resigned in 1968. Kansas State Normal president On July 1, 1871, Hoss replaced Lyman Beecher Kellogg, to become the Kansas State Normal School's second president. While president, Hoss was able to secure funds needed from the Kansas Legislature to build another building, and the school's enrollment increased to 200. In 1872, Hoss hosted state representatives at KSN, which concluded with the House securing $50,000 for the school with city of Emporia providing $10,000, the day after their visit. In April 1873, Hoss reported issues with the professors to the Kansas Board of Regents and advised that everyone employed should submit their resignations and for the Board to decide who was to be rehired; the Board decided in May 1873, to rehire Hoss, along with only one other faculty member. In August 1873, Hoss announced his resignation as president to become a professor at Indiana University. He continued until December 31 of that year. After the normal school presidency After Hoss resigned from the Normal School in 1873, him and his family returned to Indiana where he became a professor at Indiana University. Seven years later in 1880, Hoss returned to Topeka, Kansas, purchasing The Educationist. In 1884, Hoss became a professor and chair of the English Department at Baker University. In 1880 after being in Baldwin for six years, Hoss and his second wife, May Engstrom, moved to Wichita, Kansas and founded the Western School of Elocution and Oratory. The Hoss family remained there until his death in 1906. Personal life After graduating from Indiana Asbury, Hoss was married to his first wife, Harriet Mitchell, in 1850 and had a son together named Melville Mitchell in 1853. Hoss and Harriet were married until 1886 when she died due to an illness. In 1888, Hoss and May Engstrom united in marriage, in which they had one son named Wendell born in 1892. On April 11, 1906, Hoss died in Wichita.

Johnson held a professorship in the University of British Columbia, School of Nursing, with a focus on health promotion and health behaviour change.University of British Columbia Official Webpage. \\"School of Nursing\\". Biography.2014-07-07. Johnson served on the boards of the Women's Health Research Institute, the Michael Smith Foundation for Health Research, and Innovate BC. In 2014, she became SFU's first female Vice President of Research,succeeding Mario Pinto. In 2020, she was appointed to succeed Andrew Petter as SFU President.  Research Program  Johnson’s research program is geared toward promoting health and modifying health- related behaviour. Her program highlights the need to integrate sex and gender differences in research design. In particular, women and men exhibit different health behaviours and react differently to drugs and other therapies. Medical devices or other equipment physically fit the sexes differently. Ignoring these differences compromises treatment quality. One reason for ignoring sex differences in drug therapies, for example, is the standard of controlling for extraneous variables such as hormones. This is done in order to attribute health changes to the drug being tested. Because female hormones fluctuate more than do males’, experiments typically use male subjects. The obvious problem is that we then have comparatively little data about how women respond to the same drug therapies, which compromises women’s health. Johnson’s solution for researchers of any health area is to ask how sex and gender affect the issue in question. The goal of this approach is to improve the quality of health research and in turn quality of life regardless of sex or gender.

It is a remake of the 2011 Tamil- language film Mouna Guru, and features Sonakshi Sinha, Konkana Sen Sharma and Anurag Kashyap in the lead roles. Principal photography began in March 2015, and the film released worldwide on 2 September 2016. The soundtrack composed by Vishal-Shekhar has been released on 16 August 2016.  Plot  Akira Sharma (Sonakshi Sinha) is a little girl who lives happily with her father and mother. One day, she witnesses a crime involving a group of unruly men throwing acid on a young woman's face. Akira helps the police catch one of the criminals. Because of involving herself as a witness, the unruly men harass Akira and slash Akira's face out of revenge, ultimately giving her a scar. Akira's father enrolls her in a self-defense class for her to be able to protect herself in the future. On her way home one day, Akira sees the same men who attacked her previously, while fighting them, one of them takes out a bottle of acid to throw acid on her. When it backfires, the police accuse Akira of throwing acid on his face. She is arrested by the police and is eventually convicted and imprisoned in juvenile jail. Fourteen years later, Akira has grown into a brave young woman, while her father has died. Akira is released from imprisonment and after having served her jail time, she and her mother move in with her brother. Akira later joins college and lives in a hostel. At first some students try to bully and harass her but end up learning the hard way to not mess with her. One night, ACP Rane (Anurag Kashyap) runs into one of the college professors with his car and beats him up because the professor is upset about his behaviour. The college students reach out to the commissioner. The police brutally beats them up and tries to move all of the students away, with only Akira remaining. She hands over the signed petition sheet and the information to the commissioner when he arrives. A couple of days later, Rane robs and kills a man. When he admits this on the phone at his girlfriend Maya's (Raai Laxmi) place, she records his confession and decides to show it to her friends. At the last moment, her camera with all the information is stolen, and someone blackmails Rane. All this makes him nervous and he kills his girlfriend and begins searching who is behind this. The case is handled by SP Rabiya (Konkona Sen Sharma), who suspects that Maya did not commit suicide, but had been murdered. One day, Akira finds a bag full of stolen items, including the camera, in front of her dorm. Rane's associates see her and take her away and decide to kill her. She sees three of Rane's associates kill two other men. Rane calls them and tells them they have the wrong girl, but orders to shoot her. She escapes, goes to her principal, and tells him everything. Suddenly, Rane's associates take her away to a mental asylum, and, with the help of a doctor, they give her shocks and injection to prove that she is mentally unstable. She flees from the hospital with the help of another patient, Rani. She decides to prove her innocence by kidnapping one of the associates. Later, Rane traces her hideout. He and his team try to kill her, but Rabiya arrives at the right moment with orders to arrest Rane, and seizes the arms from Rane and his associates. She, however, is stopped by the commissioner because Rane killed the brother of a strong North Indian politician, who will cause riots if he knows that a policeman was involved. Rane gets back charge, after the commissioner orders him to take Akira to a mental asylum. The helpless Rabiya leaves after explaining the whole thing to Akira but quietly carries along the seized arms. Akira kills Rane and his associates but still goes to the mental hospital. Rabiya gets frustrated at her helplessness but succeeds in not registering a case against her. Akira is released three months later and decides to follow her father's footsteps by teaching challenged kids.

Its structure changed after 1989, but for most of its existence it was owned by the private trusts of each brother.

Retrieved 2015-04-18 Through careful use of labyrinthine accounting and complex strategies and corporate structures, Edper capitalized on Canada's relatively lax securities laws, tax laws, and disclosure requirements that resulted in its rapid growth into a highly complex, pyramidal empire of interwoven companies and cross-ownership. Edper controlled but did not own many companies. Privately held Edper could own a controlling stake in one public company that would hold a controlling stake in another public one that would hold a controlling stake in yet another, without having to use much of its own money. Other strategies used were cross-ownership and partial ownership of a parent company by its subsidiary and the liberal use of restricted or non- voting shares for public investors and super-voting shares for insiders. These enabled the Edper empire to raise billions of dollars without having to use much of its own money. During the Eighties boom, Bronfman-connected companies issued more securities than anyone else in Canada and raised more than $30-billion in equity. In addition to the two brothers, who were heavily involved in the management of Edper and many of its subsidiaries, there were two other men who played key roles in the Edper group's rapid expansion and management: accountant Jack Cockwell hired by the Bronfmans in the 1960s who later headed Hees International/Bancorp, Edper Equities, and Edper Investments; and Trevor Eyton, a corporate lawyer who headed Brascan Ltd. following Edper's acquisition.The controlling hand of the Edper empire, The Independent, February 14, 1993 (reprinted form the original).

For revenue, the Edper corporate structure relied heavily on dividend payouts from subsidiaries to their parent companies to cover debt obligations. It was estimated their pay-out ratio was half again as large as the average of the top 35 companies on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Some Bronfman companies paid out more in dividends than they registered in earnings. To cover their cascading losses in 1991-93, the Edper companies raised more than $9-billion through share issues, asset sales and debt financing in just 20 months. By early 1993, Edper began selling assets, notably $1.96 billion worth in February alone.

After the Canada created the Foreign Investment Review Agency in 1974 to regulate foreign investment, concerns arose about the ability to raise future investment money for a foreign-owned company (Eagle Insurance of Britain still held a majority stake in Trizec). In 1975 an agreement was reached with Edper that would leave Eagle Star with a controlling interest in Trizec, while effective control would move to a new Brofman-controlled holding company, Carena Properties.

Concerned about securing their ownership in Trizec, the Bronfmans came to an agreement with Olympia & York's Reichmann brothers to avoid future competition between their property development concerns, Canada's two largest. Transactions were then undertaken that resulted in both Edper and O&Y; having an equal 37% stake in Trizec. In 1980 Trizec acquired the US-based Ernest W. Hahn Inc.'s shopping center interests, raising Trizec's assets to $2 billion, and Trizec was renamed TrizecHahn. Two years later Trizec's assets were valued at $4 billion.

Early life and work Joseph Anthony Murphy was born in Dundalk County Louth, Ireland, December 24, 1857. He lost his mother at a young age and his father moved the family of three boys and seven girls to Chicago, where Joseph attended St. Ignatius College Prep and then entered the Society of Jesus (Jesuits) at St. Stanislaus Novitiate in Florissant, Missouri. His priestly studies were at Woodstock College, Maryland, where he was ordained a priest on August 26, 1888. He then served at Detroit College as Prefect of Studies (1895–1905) and on the mission in British Honduras from 1905 until 1910 when he suffered a severe attack of tropical fever. College dean and bishop He returned to the States to become dean of the liberal arts college of Marquette University (1910–1921) and then for two years professor of philosophy at St. Louis University. He had been requesting reassignment to the Jesuit mission and it came in the form of his appointment, at age 66, as Vicar Apostolic for British Honduras. He was consecrated bishop by Archbishop Glennon in St. Louis, Missouri, on March 19, 1924. He would preside from Holy Redeemer, the mother church in Belize with its cathedral dating back to 1858.

Born just at the edge of Catholic Ireland, he was nowhere close to being on the border line as a Catholic. From his youth he had imbibed an unwavering faith that would not admit of half measures or concessions. Murphy's zeal for Catholicism was deeply rooted in Irish Catholicism and Irish-English relations. He refused to stand for the British National Anthem at public ceremonies, or to receive the Anglican bishop for a visit. Murphy seemed to relish the ceremonial of his office.

The park is located at the mouth of the Little Salmon River. History The property that was to become Mexico Point State Park previously featured summer resorts as early as the mid-1800s, including the Mexico Point Club that existed at the property from the early 1900s through the 1950s. During the 1940s and early 1950s, professional boxing champions Carmen Basilio and Joey DeJohn utilized the property as a summer training camp. The property was acquired by the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation in the early 1960s, and remained undeveloped for many years. However, since 1992 the park has been developed and operated by the Town of Mexico after local residents encouraged the town to enter into a long-term lease of the property with New York State. The state retains ownership of the property. Park facilities The park features a swimming beach on Lake Ontario, bathhouse, picnic facilities and nature trails. Casey's Cottage, originally built as horse stables during the park's days as a resort and later remodeled as a medieval-style manor house, is claimed to be the site of paranormal activity. Ghost tours are occasionally held at the cottage. The state continues to operate the Mexico Point Boat Launch across the river from the town-operated park, which receives approximately 20,000 visitors annually.

Since June 20, 2012, the show has been broadcast on NT1 and on TV5Monde. The series was filmed partially in the Saint-Julien-le-Pauvre Church in Paris and the Royal Abbey of St. Vincent in Senlis. The series reached a peak audience of 9.9 million viewers in 2004, but it slowly began to lose viewers until its end in 2011.  Premise  Sister Thérèse is a police officer-turned nun. Her ex- husband Gérard Bonaventure, who serves as the local police lieutenant, often asks for Sister Thérèse's help in solving murder cases, and she does so with the full support of the convent's Mother Superior, who is a fan of crime fiction. In most episodes of the show, Sister Thérèse solves the crime using creative or unconventional methods, such as tracking counterfeit T-shirt sales or finding a cadaver while on a religious pilgrimage. The series also introduces plot twists, like Sister Thérèse having temporary amnesia and introducing her previously-unknown twin sister. The series also focuses on the interaction between the convent and the police force that comes as a result of Sister Thérèse's cooperation with Gérard. Gérard's assistant Gabriel uses his visits to the convent as a means to see Sister Clémence and, later on, Sister Florence. Gérard's intern Brice similarly falls in love with one of the nuns, Sister Suzanne. Gérard's partner on the police force, Lucie, does not appreciate Sister Thérèse's interference in the team's crime-solving work. The nuns also must deal with Jacky Roche, their scheming landlord, who wants to take back his property. To help in paying their rent, the nuns manufacture duvets, which they then sell on the website www.soeurtherese.com. Most episodes end with a running gag in which Sister Thérèse refuses to continue cooperating with Gérard and Gérard misidentifies her website as soeurtherese.fr.  Cast and Characters  * Dominique Lavanant as Sister Thérèse (Juliette, before joining the convent), the nun who solves crimes and also runs the convent's duvet-selling website. * Martin Lamotte as Gérard Bonaventure, Sister Thérèse's ex-husband and the city's police lieutenant. * Édith Scob as the Mother Superior, who encourages Sister Thérèse's involvement in solving crimes due to her own love of crime novels. * Sébastien Knafo as Gabriel Lambert, Gérard's assistant. * Guillaume Delorme as Brice Malory, Gérard's intern, who replaces Gabriel. * Ariane Séguillon as Lucie, Gérard's partner on the police force. * Philippe Khorsand as Jacky Roche, the landlord who wants to reclaim his property from the convent. * Taïra Borée as Sister Marie-Mayriam. * Julie de Bona as Sister Florence. * Marie Denarnaud as Sister Clémence. * Maria Ducceschi as Sister Suzanne.

He is also a Democratic former member of the Louisiana House of Representatives for District 33 in Calcasieu Parish in the southwestern portion of his state. First elected in 2007, he began his third and final term in office on January 11, 2016. Background Danahay graduated c. 1975 from Sulphur High School in Sulphur in Calcasieu Parish and thereafter obtained a Bachelor of Business Administration degree from McNeese State University in Lake Charles. He is a salesman for Lake Charles Office Supply. He has formerly resided in Baton Rouge and Vinton, also in Calcasieu Parish, dates unavailable. Political career Danahay won without opposition the District 33 House seat vacated by the Democrat (and later Republican) Ronnie Johns, who was thereafter elected without opposition in 2011 to the Louisiana State Senate. Danahay won his second term again without opposition in the primary election held on October 22, 2011. Representative Danahay served on the Louisiana Rural Caucus, the Acadiana delegation, and the Democratic Caucus. He serves on these committees: (1) Governmental Affairs (Vice chairman), (2) Municipal, Parochial and Cultural Affairs, (3) Ways and Means, (4) Executive, and (5) Joint Capital Outlay. Danahay's legislative ratings ranged from 67 to 88 percent from the conservative Louisiana Association of Business and Industry. In 2012, he was rated 83 percent by the National Federation of Independent Business. In 2013 and 2014, the conservative Louisiana Family Forum scored him 89 and 80 percent, respectively. From 2008 to 2018, he was rated every year as 100 percent by Louisiana Right to Life. In 2014, Danahay co-sponsored the requirement that abortion providers have hospital admitting privileges near their clinics; the measure passed the House, 88-5. He voted to extend the time for implementation of the Common Core State Standards Initiative. He voted to prohibit the transportation of dogs in the bed of a pick-up truck on interstate highways. In 2013, Danahay voted to reduce penalties for possession of marijuana. He supported lifetime concealed carry gun permits and the taking of weapons into restaurants. He opposed making information about permit holders a matter of public record. In 2012, he voted to prohibit the use of telephones while driving. He voted to reduce the number of hours that polling locations remain open. Louisiana has traditionally had 14-hour polling days. In 2011, he supported the requirement for drug testing of welfare recipients. Danahay left the legislature upon his election as mayor of Sulphur.

In describing it, John Lindley wrote \\"Melaleuca seriata, parviceps, and trichophylla, are bushes, every twig of which is terminated by hemispherical heads of a brilliant pink.\\" It is very similar to Melaleuca parviceps. Description Melaleuca seriata grows to about tall with its branchlets covered by small silky hairs. The leaves are arranged alternately, mostly long and wide and very narrow oval in shape although the size and shape of the leaves is variable. The flowers are arranged in heads on the ends of branches which continue to grow after flowering, or sometimes in the upper leaf axils. The heads are up to in diameter and contain between 3 and 7 groups of flowers in threes. The petals are long and fall off soon after the flowers open. The stamens, which give the flower its colour are a shade of pink, purple or mauve with yellow tips and are arranged in five bundles around the flower, each bundle containing 5 to 9 stamens. Flowering is mainly in spring but also at other times of the year. The fruit are woody capsules long. Badgingarra M. seriata fruit Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca seriata was first formally described in 1839 by John Lindley in A Sketch of the Vegetation of the Swan River Colony. The specific epithet (seriata) is from the Latin word series, meaning \\"row\\", \\"succession\\" or \\"train\\" referring to the oil glands in the leaves which often occur in two rows. Distribution and habitat This melaleuca occurs in and between the Coorow, Green Head, Perth, Bunbury, Wyalkatchem and Lake King districts in the Avon Wheatbelt, Geraldton Sandplains, Jarrah Forest, Mallee and Swan Coastal Plain biogeographic regions. It usually grows in sand over laterite or clay on sandplains and depressions which fill in winter. Conservation Melaleuca seriata is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife.

The game is available on Microsoft Windows, OS X, iOS, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Android.  Gameplay  I Am Bread puts the player in control of a slice of bread. The aim of each level is to turn the bread into toast. If the bread, before becoming toast, touches certain objects (e.g. the floor, water, or ants), it will get dirty and the \\"edibility\\" meter will go down. To control the bread the player must use the arrow keys or an analog stick. The levels are based on the seven days of the week. Several expansions have added various features, such as having players play as a baguette bent on destroying any fragile object in the room, a bagel that races around the room, and as a fragile cracker that seeks to find slices of cheese and have them stick to it while avoiding disintegration by repetitive impacts on surfaces. In addition, two other levels were added where the player plays either in zero gravity or as a \\"bread fighter\\" facing various fighters and ships made of bakery goods in a parody of Star Wars called Starch Wars. Another bonus level has a slice of bread seeking to find and complete an unfinished sandwich in the refrigerator inside a room with a slumbering Heavy set in Team Fortress 2.  Plot  Mr. Murton is a therapy patient who had a failed business in the past and a divorced wife. He is distressed over alleged break-ins into his house with the culprit supposedly leaving behind pieces of toasted bread as a taunt or warning. With each scenario, Mr. Murton progressively finds out that the culprit of the disarranged house are sentient slices of a specific bread, and at the end, throws the bread out in the trash and escapes custody from the therapy building. After a slice of bread that escaped the garbage truck causes an explosion at a gas station, another slice of bread confronts Mr. Murton while he is driving away from the scene with the intent of eliminating the bread. Terrified, Mr. Murton suffers from what appears to be a heart attack and faints, resulting in a car crash and Mr. Murton becomes injured and falls unconscious. Some time after the crash, Nigel Burke, a mysterious man with a watch, pulls over and investigates and grabs Mr. Murton off-screen, and in front of the car is a Barnardshire Sign indicating that I am Bread is a prequel to Surgeon Simulator 2013, another game by Bossa Studios.  Development  I Am Bread was developed in the Unity engine.  Reception  I Am Bread received mixed reception from critics, with PC version receiving a 60/100 Metacritic rating, based on 25 critics, the PlayStation 4 version receiving a 51/100 and the iOS version receiving a 58/100. Most criticism of the game came from the poor controls and camera angles. PC Gamer writer Jordan Erica Webber gave the game a 58/100 score and commented on the fact that \\"the game is better played in front of an audience, but there is more available than what someone may see at first glance\\". Kotaku writer Luke Plunkett said that the game might actually have \\"some depth beyond just laughing at the bread-walking.\\"  References  External links * 2015 video games Action-adventure games Android (operating system) games Bossa Studios games IOS games MacOS games Multiplayer and single-player video games PlayStation 4 games Video games developed in the United Kingdom Windows games Xbox One games Unity (game engine) games ","title":"I Am Bread"},{"id":"46468475","text":"Richard Mathey (born June 27, 1987) is an American professional wrestler who currently competes on the independent circuit and also wrestles for Lucha Underground and Championship Wrestling from Hollywood.

Kimberly was born October 23, 1790, in what was then a part of New Haven, Connecticut, and is now the town of Orange, Connecticut. He was the youngest of the twelve children of Capt. Silas and Sarah (Smith) Kimberly. He was educated in the school at Litchfield South Farms before attending college. He graduated from Yale College in 1812. He trained for the law in Springfield with Geo. Bliss, Esq, and in Fairfield, Connecticut with Hon. Roger M Sherman. In March, 1814, he was admitted to the bar in New Haven, where he soon acquired a solid reputation. In early life he bestowed much time on military affairs, holding finally the rank of Major General in the Connecticut State Militia. Other public offices were thrust upon him. He was a member of the Connecticut House of Representatives in 1826 through 1829, and 1832 through 1835. In 1831 he was Mayor of New Haven and was reelected in 1833 but declined the honor. In 1838 he was selected as a Senator of the United States by the Legislature of Connecticut, but declined. He also declined a nomination for Governor of Connecticut at a time when his election was regarded as certain. A few years later, from 1845 to 1848, he was States Attorney for New Haven County, Connecticut. On account of impaired health, Gen Kimberly, in July, 1852, began a tour in Europe, from which he returned in May, 1854, somewhat better, but he was far from being well during the closing years of his life. He continued to pay some attention to his professional business, and especially to the affairs of the New York and New Haven Railroad, when he was a Director, until a few months before his death in New Haven, December 15, 1862, aged 73 years.

Despite being just off the popular Diamond Trail, most hikers bypass the mountain as they go between Mount Kongō to the north and Mount Jinpuku to the southwest.

This was also the first season of the newly formed Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association. Game notes Bob Quincy notes in his 1973 book They Made the Bell Tower Chime: \\"John Heisman, a noted historian, wrote 30 years later that, indeed, the Tar Heels had given birth to the forward pass against the Bulldogs (UGA). It was conceived to break a scoreless deadlock and give UNC a 6-0 win. The Carolinians were in a punting situation and a Georgia rush seemed destined to block the ball. The punter, with an impromptu dash to his right, tossed the ball and it was caught by George Stephens, who ran 70 yards for a touchdown.\\" The ball was thrown out of desperation by back Joel Whitaker. Georgia coach Pop Warner complained to the referee that the play was illegal, however, the referee let the play stand because he did not see the pass. Only 4 minutes of game time had passed when Stephens scored. Aftermath The teams played a second time and North Carolina won 10 to 6.

It tells the story of a man who finds a video tape depicting a mysterious suicide and tries to figure out what happened. Plot Charles Procter shaves and goes to work. He spills coffee in his lap and goes home to change clothes. In the garage, he finds a car on fire with a dead man inside. Nearby is a video camera on a tripod, which Procter takes and brings home. The video depicts a man who goes through his morning routine, briefly meets a girl with a dog, pours petrol on the car and himself, steps into the car and lights himself on fire. Procter rewatches the video several times. The police turns up and asks about the incident. The dead man had lived a few floors above him. His name was Paul Ferguson. Procter does not mention the video to the police. Procter goes to the park where the girl from the video had been seen. He eventually sees the girl walk by and figures out where she lives. He rings on the door and claims to be from the police. The girl did not know the man. She has the dog, which the man had asked her to look after, without returning. Procter keeps watching the video. He leaves his home. The video is frozen toward the end where Procter is seen looking into the camera. Cast * John Joyce as Charles Procter * Michael Hucks as Paul Ferguson * Zoe Thorne as girl * Ray Eves as policeman 1 * Derek Hutchinson as policeman 2 Production The film was made just after Joachim Trier had graduated from the National Film and Television School. A group of students from the year below him had been granted funding for their graduation film and asked Trier to direct it. Trier agreed on the condition that he was allowed to write the script from scratch together with Eskil Vogt. The film was made quickly, which Trier appreciated, since it forced him to trust his instincts. The most demanding scene was the car fire. According to Trier, Procter was the film where he established his personal style. He had previously experimented with different aesthetics, but the simple story and production led him to a style with which he was more comfortable. It was also his first collaboration with the cinematographer Jakob Ihre, with whom he went on to make several more films. Reception Critical response Ellen Margrethe Sand of Verdens Gang described the film as \\"a densified and unsettling drama\\". Sand continued: \\"Trier utilises the scarcely allotted time and his film medium to the last drop. Without an image, even less a word - too much\\". Accolades The film won the prize for Best British Short and the UIP Prize at the Edinburgh International Film Festival; the latter meant that it was nominated for the European Film Award for Best Short Film. In Norway it was nominated for the Amanda Award for Best Short Film.

It was written by Lizzie Molyneux and Wendy Molyneux and directed by Tyree Dillihay. It aired on Fox in the United States on November 23, 2014. Plot Linda and the kids decide that they would prefer to spend Thanksgiving at the Wonder Wharf pier for the first annual \\"Turk-tacular Turkey Town Festival,\\" leaving Bob hurt and spitefully swearing off Thanksgiving completely this year, despite it being his favorite holiday. Linda plans to attend the festival's \\"Turkey Trot,\\" a marathon where the runners run alongside turkeys, à la the Running of the Bulls. Teddy joins her for the run while the Belcher siblings ride the spinning teacups ride along with the Pesto twins and Regular Size Rudy, overseen by Wonder Wharf staff member, Mickey. The festival is sponsored by Calvin Fischoeder and his brother Felix, who has incompetently failed to get enough turkeys for the run, and substituted by mixing the turkeys with an assortment of other farm animal birds. At the start of the race, the turkeys, geese, ducks, and chickens are released, but they are unnaturally aggressive and begin attacking the runners and anyone nearby. They soon overrun the Wonder Wharf and Linda is knocked unconscious by a one-eyed turkey dubbed \\"Cyclops.\\" She wakes up inside the Wonder Wharf's Fun House with Teddy, who dragged her to safety. He explains that as a boy, he spent a summer on a turkey farm and learned a lot about them. The birds' aggressiveness is due to their pecking order being thrown into chaos after being mixed together with different bird species and humans. He explains that normally, a head bird would establish dominance by pecking the others, but without a clear pecking order, they are running amok and pecking everything around them. Linda realizes that her kids are still riding the rides and she and Teddy encounter Mickey, who admits that he left her kids and their friends on the still- running teacup ride and fled after being attacked by birds. The three of them go to rescue the kids. Calvin and Felix discuss the disaster outside Wonder Wharf, but are caught arguing during a news broadcast, exposing the disaster as their fault. Meanwhile, Bob, unaware of the chaos, stays in the apartment singing and dancing along to an old Donna Summer CD and getting drunk. He rationalizes that skipping Thanksgiving is great, but succumbs to his desire to cook Thanksgiving dinner upon seeing his favorite turkey baster in the drawer. He leaves Linda a note and drunkenly and hastily runs to the grocery store, unaware of the danger around him. Linda, Teddy, and Mickey find the five kids still trapped on the teacups with Andy, Ollie, and Rudy and try to shut the ride down using its fail-safe. They succeed after several tries and return to the apartment with everyone to seek shelter. Linda finds Bob's note and they hurry to the store. They find Bob being attacked by Cyclops and the group is quickly surrounded by the birds. Recalling Teddy's words, Linda realizes that she can establish dominance and \\"pecks\\" everyone in the group with head butts, then pecks Cyclops, who starts a pecking order among the other birds. The order restored, they fall in line, viewing Linda as the alpha \\"turkey\\" and the group is able to safely leave. Back at the Belcher residence the entire family sits down to enjoy Bob's dinner along with Teddy, Mickey and Rudy as their guests; but lose their appetites upon seeing the cooked turkey; meanwhile, back at the Fischoeder residence Calvin and Felix enjoy dinner but are attacked by turkeys crashing through their window. Reception Alasdair Wilkins of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A-, stating that the outlandish plot requiring hundreds of aggressive turkeys interacting with the main characters was well-served by the animated nature of the show, commenting that such a feat would be difficult if not impossible to achieve on a live-action show. He called the episode a \\"triumph\\" and likewise praised the guest starring returns of Kline, Galifianakis, and Hader in a single episode. Robert Ham of Paste gave the episode an 8.5 out of 10, praising the homage to Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds and the use of Donna Summer's \\"Dim All the Lights\\" for the soundtrack to key scenes: \\"Just as The Simpsons have cornered the market on Halloween-themed episodes with their annual \\"Treehouse of Horror,\\" so too has Bob’s Burgers become the most reliable source for Thanksgiving-themed hilarity. And this year, writers Wendy and Lizzie Molyneux have upped the ante by adding a Hitchcock-style bird attack, and one of the best uses of Donna Summer’s music to soundtrack a scene.\\" The episode received a .9 rating and was watched by a total of 1.9 million people. This made it the fifth most watched show on Fox that night, losing to Brooklyn Nine-Nine, Family Guy, and The Simpsons.

As the early Quakers tried to distance themselves from the practices of the English Church at the time, they also distanced themselves from the church traditions of singing music, even Psalms, together. Absolute honesty and integrity was important to them, and people singing words together were often expressing thoughts that even if they were spiritually profound were not actually expressing true experience and profound beliefs of the singers, who were often merely parroting them. Music was at times also viewed as frivolous, and not in line with the value of Simplicity, in other words a distraction from what was really important in life. However, they did approve of \\"singing in the spirit,\\" when the act of singing and making music was a natural and organic method of expressing belief. 19th and 20th Century During the 19th century there was a split within Quakerism, with one branch wanting to return to some of the ways of Protestant churches, with a programmed service including hymns, and the other wishing to retain the traditional service of silent worship punctuated by spontaneous ministry. Although non-programmed Quaker Meetings for Worship remained silent, for the most part, with music rarely used, the attitudes towards music began to shift towards a more relaxed view in the mid-nineteenth century. In particular, many of the poems of John Greenleaf Whittier were set to music and well received. The hymn \\"How Can I Keep from Singing?,\\" first published in 1868 by Robert Lowry, was adopted by twentieth century Quakers. The lyrics to the first verse are as follows: My life flows on in endless song; Above earth's lamentation, I hear the sweet, tho' far-off hymn That hails a new creation; Thro' all the tumult and the strife I hear the music ringing; It finds an echo in my soul— How can I keep from singing? One of the most notable versions was created and performed by Peter Seeger, who was told it was a Quaker song. The song was, and continues to be, such a favorite of the Quaker community that is often wrongly attributed to Quaker or Shaker origins. 20th century English Quaker songwriters include Donald Swann of Flanders & Swann, and Sydney Carter, whose best-known song is \\"Lord of the Dance\\". Contemporary British Quaker choral music Historically, British Quakers had been especially reluctant to include music in their Meetings. However, London Quaker youth arts group, The Leaveners, was founded in 1978 and have since brought organized music to the Quaker community. They have commissioned and performed multiple pieces, and developed the Quaker Festival Chorus. Contemporary American Quaker musicians Carrie Newcomer, Annie Patterson, Peter Blood, David Wilcox Jon Watts is a Quaker musician, poet, and filmmaker. He has created and released six musical albums, combining spoken word, rap, hip hop, and folk styles. Specifically, he practices Liberal Quakerism, and uses his music to speak about the Liberal Quaker experience and ideals.http://esr.earlham.edu/resources-for-meetings-churches/vocal- ministry/watts_interview He currently travels and performs his music, and speaks about his life in the Society of Friends. He is also the director of “QuakerSpeak,” a YouTube channel which focuses on interviews with Quakers of different backgrounds.http://quakerspeak.com/about/ Watts graduated from the Quaker Leadership Scholarship Program at Guilford College in 2006. It was for his senior project at Guilford that Watts created the album A Few Songs Occasioned, composed of songs about the beginnings of the Quaker movement.

The game was broadcast from KYW, a Westinghouse radio station in Chicago, to WEAF, an American Telephone & Telegraph station in New York City, and from there to the rest of the country. Historian Ronald Smith has called it \\"probably the most important radio broadcast up to that point.\\" Game summary Fullback John Webster Thomas scored Chicago's three touchdowns, one in each of the first three quarters, but the team failed to score an extra point for any of them. Walter Camp wrote in picking Thomas first-team All- American: \\"It is safe to say he did far more against the Princeton line in effective scoring than did any backs of the East who met the Tigers\\". Princeton stuffs Chicago. The Tigers had scored a single touchdown in the second quarter, and also the extra point for a total of seven; they then scored two additional touchdowns for 14 points in the final quarter to win the game, while holding Chicago scoreless. With 12 minutes to play and Chicago nursing an 18–7 lead, Howdy Gray of Princeton picked up a Jimmy Pyott fumble and ran it 40 yards for the touchdown. Gray's father, the president of the Union Pacific Railroad, reacted by waving his program in the air, striking a woman in the shoulder. After an additional Princeton touchdown was scored, Chicago responded with a fierce drive ending in a goal line stand with Thomas falling short of the goal. Halfback Harry \\"Maud\\" Crum scored Princeton's other touchdowns.cf. Aftermath At one point late in the game, Chicago assistant Fritz Crisler implored Amos Stagg to send in Alonzo Jr. at quarterback to call an end run. Ever the sportsman, Stagg flatly refused, citing afterwards \\"the rules committee deprecates the use of a substitute to convey information.\\" Both teams finished the contest badly exhausted, especially Princeton, as during the last half of the game the heat was oppressive. The Princeton Alumni Weekly noted: \\"If this game proved anything at all it proved that a fine forward passing game can defeat a fine line-plunging game.\\" See also *College football on radio *1922 college football season *1921 West Virginia vs. Pittsburgh football game References 1922 college football season College football games Chicago Maroons football games Princeton Tigers football games October 1922 sports events 1922 in sports in Illinois ","title":"1922 Princeton vs. Chicago football game"},{"id":"46469202","text":"Chornobyl.3828, or Chernobyl.3828, is a 2011 Ukrainian documentary film about the Chernobyl disaster.

The massacre occurred at the start of the Bosnian War. Background Snagovo was among the hardest hit villages at the start of the Bosnian War in 1992. Between April and June 1992, Serbs ethnically cleansed the village of its Bosnian Muslim residents. Overview On 29 April 1992, Serbs captured a group of 36 Bosnian Muslim civilians who were hiding in the woods in Snagovo and took them to a school building in Rašidov Han within Snagovo. In total 36 Bosnian Muslim civilians were killed, including children and pregnant women. The corpses were burned in an effort to conceal the crime. On 2 May 1992, fellow residents of Snagovo found the burned remains and buried them nearby. One of the residents said \\"We came to this site and dug a grave. However, during the burial, our Serb neighbors shot at us. We later buried them (the victims) in the dark.\\" Exhumation and reburial The remains of the victims were exhumed from the original place of burial on 16 March 2006. On 27 July 2011, 21 of the victims were given a proper burial in a joint grave at a local cemetery in Snagovo including the youngest victim, six-month old Meliha Dogić who was killed in the arms of her mother. The girl's mother and father were also killed. Most of the victims were not identifiable because their bodies had burnt so badly. Trials Serbian Major Zoran Janković was arrested 9 May 2006. The Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina confirmed his indictment on 8 November 2006. Janković plead not guilty on 24 November 2006. His trial began on 26 March 2007. Survivors described being taken to Rašidov Han and shot at by Janković and other Serbs. Witnesses said that Janković introduced himself as a White Eagle and showed off a knife with which he claimed to have killed in the Vukovar massacre in Croatia. Janković was on trial for the killing of 36 people and wounding of three others in Snagovo, as well as for the forced removal of captured civilians in the nearby villages of Šeher and Like in May 1992. He was acquitted of crimes against humanity on 19 June 2007 due to lack of evidence and released. Related events Seven mass graves, containing the skeletal remains of 156 individuals, victims of the July 1995 Srebrenica Genocide, were uncovered in Snagovo. The 156 victims were moved to the seven \\"secondary graves\\" in Snagovo from the original burial sites around Srebrenica to hide the traces of the atrocity. Among other massacres, six more people were killed in the village on 22 July 1995.

A strategic programme within the TABC is the Transatlantic Business Dialogue (TABD). The TABC, with contact offices in Washington, D.C. and Brussels, considers itself the only officially recognized transatlantic voice of business on trade and investment issues. The Transatlantic Business Council is a regular participant in ad-hoc meetings on trade related issues with the European Commission.  History  The TransAtlantic Business Dialogue (TABD) was established by the US government and European Union in 1995 as the official business sector advisory group for EU and US officials on trade and investment issues. The purpose of the TABD was to foster an ongoing dialogue between business and government at the highest levels. It had become clear to both governments that international business maintains a unique and indispensable perspective on trade liberalization, and that it was necessary to create an official forum that allowed these transatlantic businesses to come together in a single setting where they would be able to address their mutual concerns. Meetings and conferences The first TABD conference was held in Seville, Spain in 1995 and concluded in the creation of working groups on standards and regulatory issues, trade liberalization, investment, and third country relations. As it was the first time that the private sector held an official role in determining EU/US public policy, the Seville conference signified a milestone in transatlantic trade relations. US Secretary of Commerce Ronald Brown convened the conference along with European Commission Vice President Sir Leon Brittan and Commissioner Dr. Martin Bangemann, and it was met with enthusiasm across the transatlantic business community. The last TABD program meeting took place in January in Davos/Switzerland in the margins of the World Economic Forum. Government guests and speakers included Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny, OECD Secretary General Ángel Gurría and Michael Froman, Assistant to President Barack Obama and US Deputy National Security Advisor for International Economic Affairs. Founding of the TABC The TABC was founded 1 January 2013, in a merger of the existing Transatlantic Business Dialogue (1995) and the European-American Business Council (EABC), founded in 1997 as the successor of the European Community Chamber of Commerce in the United States.  Transatlantic Business Dialogue (TABD)  With the founding of the Transatlantic Business Council ion 2013, the Dialogue has been reshaped as a programme within the TABC. The TABD program is the highest forum within the TBC and brings together European and American CEOs and C-suite executives. The TABD meets twice a year, leading to the development of joint policy recommendations to the US and European governments on a number of trade-related issues. The TABD continually provides input on a number of trade issues, including financial services, raw materials/recycling, and eMobility. Since 2007, the Transatlantic Economic Council (TEC), which is the primary plenary for economic dialogue between the US and EU, has served as an additional platform for the TABD to exercise its advisory role. TABD’s ultimate goal has always been to facilitate the eventual establishment of a barrier-free transatlantic market, which would further global trade liberalization. Consequently, the launch of free trade negotiations between the US and EU exemplifies TABD’s efforts, and places the program in an attractive position vis-à-vis the negotiators.  Members  The list of TABC Member Companies includes a number of important multinational corporations: * AIG * Applied Materials * ASTM * AT&T; * Audi AG * BASF * BBVA * BDO * British American Tobacco * BT * Chevron Corporation * Cisco Systems * Cognizant * Covidien * Covington & Burling LLP * Deloitte * Deutsche Bank * Deutsche Telekom * European-American Business Organization Inc.

She was a parliamentary candidate for Mid Sussex (UK Parliament constituency) in the 2015 British General Election. Journalism Television Beki worked as a journalist for print, before later moving into television and presented the BBC Television show Top Gear during the 1980s. Speaking of her time presenting the programme, \\"Back then there were only four television channels and at our height we were getting seven million viewers. I just remember looking down the camera lens and thinking I've got this huge audience and I'm talking about a car. It felt like such a waste.\\". Print Adamas has published several books related to motoring, including 'Star Cars', 'Cobra' and 'Ferrari V8'. Research Cannabis Adams spent time investigating the prohibition of cannabis during the 1990s, resulting in her opening a cannabis cafe in Brighton in 1993. The cafe was shut down by police after 57 minutes. Fracking Adams is a known opponent of hydraulic fracturing, claiming that the UK has \\"other alternatives for UK energy supply and security, and, quite clearly, it is time to turn our undivided attention to them.\\". Her independent research and opposition of fracking led her to become a contributor of evidence during the Infrastructure Bill committee debates in 2015.

Electric cars Adamas advocates electric car use, \\"The more people buy electric cars, the more the price will come down. I think today's politics are outdated and so is our view on technology.

It is situated on the Prins Hendrikkade and was erected on the spot where Cornelis Houtman's first trip to the East Indies had begun in 1595. The first part was built 1913 - 1916 (during World War I); the second part was built 1926 -1928. Originally, it was the headquarters of six leading Amsterdam shipping companies: the Netherlands Steamship Company (SMN), the Royal Packet Navigation Company (KPM), the Java- China-Japan Line (JCJL) and the Royal Dutch Steamboat Company (KNSM) with subsidiary New Rhine Navigation Company (NRM) and acquired in 1912 Royal West India Mail Service (KWIM).  Design  Sculptures at main entrance A large group of artists participated in the extensive decoration of both the exterior and the interior of the building. The shipping companies housed inside were all involved in global trade, their combined lines \\"circumnavigated the earth in several directions\\" from Dutch hub points in the East and West Indies. As it was intended to serve as a practical, modern and functional office and also refer to the rich maritime tradition of the Netherlands, there are numerous maritime symbols incorporated into the design. For example, the outside of the building is covered in carving and relief sculptures that reflect the Dutch colonial empire, with the sculpted personifications of the oceans around the main entrance presented as \\"exotic mysterious women\\". The building's design and execution were entrusted to the brothers Johan Godart and Adolf Daniel Nicholas van Gendt. The van Gendt brothers were responsible for the technical implementation and the design of the concrete frame. The architectural design was left to the then relatively unknown architect Johan van der Mey. The Amsterdam School architects Michel de Klerk and Piet Kramer also contributed. The design has been described as still holding \\"the charm and brilliance\\" of the era. Construction 273x273px For the construction a public company was founded with a capital of 1,000,000 guilders. The building was planned to occupy 1,400 square metres at the corner of the Prins Hendrikkade and Binnenkant. Thirteen buildings had to be demolished: numbers 108 to 114 on Prins Hendrikkade and numbers 1 to 6 on Binnenkant. The first phase was 1913-16 and the expansion was completed twelve years later (1926–28). In order to avoid colour variation, the bricks were baked at the same time for both construction phases. Various types of brick, ironwork, stained glass, exotic hardwoods and textiles were processed in large quantities. The materials used were extremely costly with some types of brick and moulds for profiles being specially designed. Besides terracotta, much precious stone was also used, including granite, marble and varieties of porphyry diorite. The former main entrance on the corner Prins Hendrikkade and Binnenkant is topped by a truncated tower structure, coated with copper-coloured English slate. The lead eaves were executed in the form of ship ropes, golf, and fishing cups. Interior Enclosed stained-glass ceiling above the main staircase showing typical nautical themes.  Staircase  Several features of the building are particularly noteworthy: the richly decorated central staircase; the boardroom on the floors at the corner of the Prins Hendrikkade and the Binnenkant; and the large meeting room on the third floor on the Prins Hendrikkade side. The ironwork in the central staircase forms a connecting link between the floors. The stairwell is enclosed by stained-glass, implemented and designed - as was almost all the other stained-glass work in the building - by the glazier William Bogtman. The building contains a working paternoster lift.  Large meeting room  The large meeting or deliberation room on the third floor was by the interior designer T. Nieuwenhuis. Its interior fittings are made of dark tropical woods such as mahogany, ebony and coromandel. During a renovation in 1972 the stained-glass windows were shortened, original wall coverings were redone in a lighter shade and the original wall lamps, ceiling and chandelier removed. The original chandelier, executed in openwork brass, was replaced in 1974.  Hotel  left The last shipping company left the building in 1981 and the Shipping House was occupied in August 1983 by the Amsterdam Municipal Transport Company (GVB). By 2004, the GVB had gone elsewhere. After a major renovation, the building was opened on 8 June 2007 as a five star hotel/ restaurant/ conference centre containing 165 rooms, including 22 suites, eight banquet and meeting rooms, a restaurant, a bar/lounge and a wellness centre. In designing the hotel interior, Amsterdam-based architect Ray Kentie was inspired by the original sumptuous Art Nouveau style. In keeping with the tradition of the Gesamtkunstwerk, he invited artists like Gerti Bierenbroodspot and Christie van der Haak to complete the renovation. Bierenbroodspot paintings and sculptures of shells, fish, mermaids and sea monsters can be viewed in all the rooms and corridors, and there are even hand painted Delft Blue dolphins on the bottom of the pool. Bierenbroodspot also designed the porcelain used in the restaurant. Christie van der Haak was inspired by Van Nieuwenhuis patterns in the designs for the decoration of the room interiors, the restaurant and the bar. The damask table napkins were hand woven in the workshops of the National Dutch Textile Museum.

In its larval form It is commonly known by the name toe-biter, and its Maori name is puene. The species is native to New Zealand. Although there are many other species of fishfly in other parts of the world, Archichauliodes diversus is the only species of fishfly in New Zealand. Description Archichauliodes larvae are one of the biggest freshwater insects in New Zealand. The thorax and head are black and flattened, and the head has a large set of mandibles. The larvae are sturdy animals with heavily sclerotised heads and thoracic segments. The abdomen is long and light in colour and it has 8 pairs of tentacle-like gills projecting from abdominal segments 1-8. Like other fishfly larvae they have anal prolegs with a pair of terminal hooks which they use to attach themselves to substrate, and they lack a terminal filament.  Distribution  Archichauliodes diversus is the only member of the genus (and family) found in New Zealand where it is endemic and common throughout the country. It is common in streams nationwide, with moderate to good water quality, and has tolerance values of 7 (hard bottom sites) and 7.3 (soft bottom sites). A. diversus prefers stony or hard-bottom streams in bush covered and farmland areas. It also likes to have overhanging canopy/bush overhead for shelter, lifestyle and large rock pools. It thrives in good quality water. Life cycle/Phenology Archichauliodes diversus larvae are aquatic and the adults are terrestrial. It spends most of its life in the aquatic juvenile stage (2–5 years). The larvae leaves the stream between every molt, a unique feature of this species. It has a generation time of more than a year, and the adult are found near streams. A. diversus has many stages throughout its life, changing greatly not only in size but also in appearance as it progresses from egg, larval, prepupal, pupal and imaginal stages. A. diversus is nocturnal, most active at dusk and at night. The first stage of the life cycle is the egg which is light yellow and cylindrical in appearance and shape when it is first laid. It then turns colour when open to air to dark brown. This stage lasts around 30 days. Larvae are roughly around 2.2 mm when they hatch, and can grow to around 38.5 mm. It has 8 pairs of ‘gills’ that run down the abdomen which acts as the respiration system. This is the only documented stage during which it eats. This stage occurs all year round. In the third stage, the prepupa, it migrates towards the water edge or water banks. This phase occurs from early July to late January and lasts for 15 weeks. This is due to the water levels being at maximum height as the prepupa needs the soils to be saturated for the next life cycle stage to occur. The pupal stage lasts around 20–24 days. This time frame also depends on the gender, males taking longer than females. This occurs from late October to February. Although the pupa is similar to the adults, it has a bigger build and undeveloped wings. The colour changes in a matter of hours to days, starting out pale in colour then changing to dark brown. The last stage is the adult (\\"imago\\") stage, which only lives for roughly 6–10 days. In this stage, they spent most of their time resting in nearby trees. Before dying, the female lays several hundred eggs in irregular masses on nearby trees, scrubs, and rocks. Diet Archichauliodes diversus larvae are predatory and use their large serrated mandibles to catch other aquatic invertebrates, especially mayflies, such as Aoteapsyche and Atalophlebioides. They are mostly active at night and they ambush prey around the center of riffles where there is a lot of oxygen and the turbulence stirs up prey, with the main food source being mayfly naiads, though they will eat nearly anything smaller, including members of their own species. Invertebrate predators such as Archichauliodes diversus are competitors with fish, since they eat many of the same prey animals, e.g. Ephemeroptera, which are an important food source for fish in streams. Predators, Parasites, and Diseases Known species that prey on Archichauliodes diversus include Brown trout and Galaxiidae (incl. Galaxias). The larval stage is at risk of predation by caddisfly larvae and stonefly larvae. Spiders, such as lycosids, and beetles are also a risk for pupae and pre-pupal stages, as are birds. The biggest threat to this species is human habitat alteration,EOL Encyclopedia of life. (2015 March 31). Archichauliodes diversus: Associations. Retrieved from http://eol.org/pages/4129367/details by removing overhanging bush and trees from the waterways. This has a significant negative impact as it is a critical part in the life cycle, though A. diversus is not regarded as a ‘clean-water’ taxon.

It is similar to Melaleuca pauperiflora except that it has small, spoon-shaped leaves. Description Melaleuca sheathiana is a shrub or small tree growing to a height of with papery bark. The leaves are arranged alternately, long, wide, narrow spoon shaped, almost circular in cross section and with a rounded or blunt point on the end. The flowers are cream or white, arranged in heads or short spikes with 4 to 11 individual flowers, the spike up to in diameter. The stamens are arranged in five bundles around the flower and there are 9 to 14 stamens per bundle. The main flowering season is spring and is followed by fruit which are woody capsules long in clusters along the stem. Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca sheathiana was first formally described in 1902 by William Fitzgerald in \\"Journal and Proceedings of the Royal Society of Western Australia\\". The specific epithet (sheathiana) is to honour Jeremiah Sheath, an early Superintendent of King's Park in Perth. The common name, boree or booree, is taken from the Noongar name for the plant. Distribution and habitat Boree occurs in and between the Lake Barlee, Lake Cronin and Rawlinna districts in the Coolgardie, Mallee and Murchison biogeographic regions where it grows in sandy, clayey or loamy soils on stony hillsides and dunes.

It belongs to the genus Mycoplasma, a well-known group of obligate intracellular parasites that inhabit humans. It also is known to be an opportunistic pathogen in immunocompromised humans. As with other Mycoplasma species, M. orale is not readily treated with many antibiotics due to its lack of a peptidoglycan cell wall. Therefore, this species is relevant to the medical field as physicians face the task of treating patients suffering from infections with this microbe. It is characterized by a small physical size (0.1 micrometer in diameter on average), a small genome size, and a limited metabolism. It is also known to frequently contaminate laboratory experiments. This bacteria is very similar physiologically and morphologically to its sister species within the genus Mycoplasma; however, its recent discovery leaves many questions still unanswered about this microbe.  Discovery and isolation  Taylor-Robinson et al. identified and named M. orale in 1964 after isolating it from the oral cavity of a child at a Washington hospital and three servicemen stationed in North Carolina. Taylor-Robinson et al. cultured the organism under anaerobic conditions on PPLO agar and broth. The resulting colony growth had a \\"fried egg\\" appearance when cultured on solid PPLO agar. PPLO is stands for \\"Pleuropneumonia-like organisms\\" and was originally designed for growth of parasitic bacteria found in the respiratory tract of cattle; it is now known that these bacteria were Mycoplasma species. PPLO agar is used for isolation and growth of Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma species; it contains beef heart infusion, yeast extract, phenol red, sodium chloride, the antibiotic Polymyxin B, the antifungal Amphotericin B, the antibiotic Penicillin, deionized water, and horse serum. Taylor-Robinson et al. confirmed M. orale was distinct from previously discovered Mycoplasma species with a serological test using haemagglutination of sheep erythrocytes, tannic acid and sonnicated Mycoplasma extracts. L.G. Tallgren et al. also isolated M. orale in 1974 from a sample of bone marrow taken from a three- year-old boy suffering from Eosinophilic leukaemia. The sample was obtained via a bone marrow biopsy performed at Aurora Hospital in Helsinki, Finland. L.G. Tallgren et al. noted this organism had a typical Mycoplasma \\"fried egg\\" appearance when cultured on solid media.  Taxonomic and phylogenetic classification  As determined by 16S rRNA sequencing, M. orale is a bacterium belonging to the genus Mycoplasma. Its closest relative within the genus is M. salivarius, while its most distant is M. mycoides. M. orale and M. salivarius have both been observed in the human oral cavity, evidencing their close proximity in the genus Mycoplasma. Of the over 100 documented species in the genus Mycoplasma, 14 are known pathogens to humans. This comes as no surprise, as the class Mollicutes contains common commensals or pathogens of several different organisms. Many species in the genus Mycoplasma are commonly found associated with pelvic or genital region infections including M. fermentans and M. hominis. Other species in this genus are the causative agents of respiratory related infections; these species include the well-known Mycoplasma pneumoniae. The family Mycoplastaceae includes the genera Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma. Bacteria in the genus Ureaplasma are known commensals in humans and possess the enzyme Urease (catalyzes urea to carbon dioxide and ammonia). Both Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma species can be grown on the same PPLO medium due to their similarities in metabolism and growth requirement.  Parasitism and genomics  While the genome of M. orale itself has not been fully sequenced, information can be surmised from the sequence data of its close relatives. Members of the genus Mycoplasma are known for their incredibly small genomes, with an average size of 0.6 Mb. This is the smallest discovered self-replicating genome of all known prokaryotes. This significantly reduced genome size is thought to be the result of the taxon's evolution into obligate parasites. Mycoplasma species typically invade and adhere to host cells from which they obtain their nutrients, usually at the expense of the host. All members of this genus, including M. orale, inhabit a wide range of mammalian hosts. Though M. orale usually exists as a commensal in human oral cavities, it is an opputunistic pathogen and will cause illness in human hosts when conditions are right. Due to their small genome size and parasitic lifecycle, they lack many non-essential biosynthetic pathways in their metabolism. These include those for cell wall synthesis as well as purine synthesis. These genomic characteristics make them a good model for the Minimal Genome Concept. Mycoplasma members, including M. orale, also generally have a low G-C content compared to other bacteria. Research has revealed that the 16S rRNA gene of M. orale is about 1,510 bp.  Growth: metabolism and reproduction  As stated previously, M. orale is an obligate parasite found in humans and primates according to the GIDEON Guide of medically relevant bacteria. This evolution into parasitism has resulted in the loss of many functional metabolic pathways. Therefore, these organisms are unable to grow and reproduce in culture without the necessary nutrients and metabolites present in media. M. orale is cultured using a special medium, the 1076b. SP4-Z MEDIUM. This medium contains either glucose or arginine (but not both at the same time) as a carbon source; however, it does not contain yeast extract. For exact information regarding all components of this medium see \\"DSMZ Medium\\" in External Links. It is considered to be a mesophilic bacteria growing best at a temperature of 37 °C. This is expected, as theoretically it should grow best at the basal temperatures of its host. This organism was also found to grow optimally at pH 6.0 and had phosphatase activity at .2 Ual/Mg of protein. Unlike other Mycoplasmas, M. orale does not have the ability to ferment glucose. It is also unable to aerobically reduce 2-3-5 triphenyl tetrazolium. This demonstrated its close phylogenetic relationship to other Mycoplasma species which inhabit human hosts. M. orale was observed to divide in two ways: by either binary fission or by forming mycelial filaments in colonies. Binary fission was observed deeper within colony growth while mycelial growth was found to occur more toward the air interface. Thus, it was inferred that mycelial growth is associated with aerobic conditions, while growth by binary fission is associated with a more anaerobic environment.  Medical relevance  M. orale is considered to be a non-pathogenic commensal, especially in immunocompetent individuals. However, abscesses containing M. orale have been noted in patients who are immunocompromised. A study was conducted on bacterial samples taken from a 33-year-old immunocompromised male. This individual presented with fever, increased weight loss, and shoulder pain among other pathologies. Samples were obtained from the patient and grown on media for testing. 16S rRNA sequencing was completed and revealed the culprit of the infection, M. orale. This revealed the ability of this organism to cause pathology in humans. Infections with Mycoplasma members, including M. orale, can be difficult to treat with antibiotics due to their lack of a cell wall. This lack of peptidoglycan confers resistance to any antibiotics that may target its synthesis, including the commonly used penicillin and its derivatives as well as vancomycin. This presents a challenge to physicians as they try to treat their patients suffering from bacterial Mycoplasma infections.  Lab contamination  Mycoplama species are commonly found in labs as contaminants. Beginning in 1956 through the early 2000s, various organizations including Johns Hopkins, US Food and Drug Administration and the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen (DSMZ) in Germany, among others, have reported varying degrees of Mycoplasma contamination ranging from 15%-70% of cell cultures. Mycoplasma contaminations are problematic because they are difficult to prevent and negatively impact host cell growth. Contamination is common due to their small physical size, lack of cell wall, and pleomorphism. Pleomorphism is defined as an organism's ability to modify their shape and size as a response to changes in their environment. Pleomorphism in Mycoplasma species allows bypassing of typical membrane filtration systems. As previous stated, their lack of a cell wall prevents the use of antibiotics to inhibit unwanted cell growth on cultured media. In addition to culture contamination, Mycoplasma contaminating cell cultures can have a negative effect on host cell growth by stealing nutrients from host cells. M. orale has been found to inhibit host cell growth by outcompeting the host cell for arginine. It is important to prevent contamination of Mycoplasma for reliable and accurate laboratory research results.

The colonial molasses trade occurred throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries in the British colonies of the Americas. Molasses was a major trading product. Molasses was produced via the exploitation of enslaved persons in sugar plantations in the Caribbean (also called the West Indies), in islands controlled by England (e.g., Jamaica and Barbados), Spain (e.g., Santo Domingo), and France (e.g., Martinique). The English colonies along the Atlantic (mainly the Thirteen Colonies) purchased molasses and used it to produce rum, primarily in distilleries in New England. Colonial rum production Sugarcane grows in hot, humid climates. After landing in the Canary Islands, Christopher Columbus brought sugarcane to the Caribbean during his second voyage to the Americas, in 1493. During the eighteenth century, sugar-refining methods at the time produced much more molasses to sugar than they do today. It was estimated that \\"as much as three parts molasses was produced to four parts sugar, and on an average it was estimated that the ratio of molasses to sugar was about one to two.\\".Ostrander, 1956 This molasses was either used for table use or in the production of rum. To make rum, sugarcane juice or molasses is fermented with yeast and water and then distilled in copper pot stills. The liquor was given the name rum in 1672, likely after the English slang word rumballion which meant clamor.McCusker, 1989 Sugar plantation owners in the Caribbean often sold rum on discount to the naval ships so that they would spend more time close to the islands, providing protection from pirates. Rum also gained popularity in Britain as English ships brought the liquor from America across the Atlantic. Economic significance The triangular trade. In the 18th century, New England became one of the leading rum producers in the world. It was the colonies’ only commodity that could be produced in large quantities by non-English powers and sold to the English. The French West Indies had a large supply of molasses at this time, but the area was lacking in lumber, cheese, and flour. These products were the main exports of the North American colonies, which led to a very secure business relationship between the two areas. Molasses was important in triangular trade. In the triangular trade, traders from New England would bring rum to Africa, and in return, they would acquire African slaves. These slaves then brought to the West Indies and sold to sugarcane plantations to harvest the sugar for molasses. Molasses was then brought from the West Indies to the colonies and sold to rum producers. Problems with demand The molasses trade experienced many problems in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Throughout this period, there was often never enough demand to meet the large supply of molasses that was continuing to increase. Neither England nor France had much of a market for molasses. England imported molasses mostly in the form of rum, but that was usually coming from the colonies at this time. The French islands in the West Indies were prohibited from shipping rum to France with regard to France's market for brandy.Molasses Trade, 2003 In the last decades of the eighteenth century, imports of French rum were at an all-time low. To combat this problem, many English planters on the islands developed their own local distilleries in order to deal with the large surplus of molasses. There were no specific restrictions on the English islands, so they were able to profit from the disposal. By the 1650s, many plantations on the islands had their own distilleries and were exporting rum to the mainland colonies. By the beginning of the eighteenth century, rum production was rising rapidly. Dutch threat to the monopoly At the beginning of the eighteenth century, Dutch possessions in the West Indies began to encourage trade with the islands and New England. Several bills were to be prepared in order to hinder Dutch trade with colonies, but none of them were passed. By 1715, Boston and many other colonial areas were importing around one hundred thousand gallons of molasses from the Dutch annually.McCusker, 1989 New York was also importing large amounts of foreign molasses compared to English. At the same time, French imports of molasses to the colonies were also growing. This combination of importing foreign product to the English colonies caused England a lot of agitation in the years to come. Molasses Act of 1733 When the trading of molasses first began, it was unrestrained, apart from small local taxes. The colonies began to prefer French molasses to British because of the price difference. French policy provided incredibly cheap prices, and the British could no longer compete. In order to control the molasses trade with the English colonies, the Parliament of Great Britain decided to place high taxes on any molasses that was shipped from a foreign power to the colonies in North America. The Molasses Act of 1733 imposed a fee of six pence per gallon on foreign molasses.Molasses Trade, 2003 This act was meant to force the colonies into buying molasses from the British or stop producing rum in North America. Many, however, say that the Molasses Act was put in place to destroy New England’s rum industry. Contrary to Parliament’s plans, the colonies first protested this act. They soon realized that instead of complying with the new Molasses Act, it would be much easier for them to just ignore the new prohibitive taxes and smuggle molasses from the West Indies. Many ports collected about half of the legal duty that must have been imported to their harbors. This was clear in Massachusetts where it \\"...imported legally less than half as much molasses and rum as it exported...\\"Ostrander, 1956 These illicit operations would continue for several decades. Had the Molasses Act succeeded in its purpose, New England rum production would have been destroyed. Sugar Act of 1764 After the French and Indian War, the British tried once again to impose strict policy on trading goods that benefited the colonies. In 1764, the new British prime minister, George Grenville pressed the Sugar Act to revive what the Molasses Act had failed to do. The colonies once again protested this the act and succeeded in lowering the tax, but the penalties and fines angered the colonies still. Although the act was only in place for two years, it was much more successful in its goals than the previous Molasses Act. Smuggling, however, was still very common. This was proven by the fact that annually, the British West Indies exported about a million gallons of molasses to the colonies.McCusker, 1989 After the Sugar Act was instated, exports fell in the coming years, according to records. On the other hand, mainland rum production rose during those years. The Sugar Act was later repealed in 1766, and a penny-per-gallon tax was placed on British and foreign molasses imports. This law marked the first large-scale legal importation of rum and molasses, but smuggling still continued. When the colonies gained their independence, they were freed from these restraints, but their trade with the British West Indies restricted. Although the law was later changed to allow direct importation of molasses to New England, the Navigation Acts hindered American shipping until around 1830. By the end of the colonial period, \\"only about one-sixteenth of the molasses imported to the mainland came from the British sugar islands.\\"Ostrander, 1956 Other uses of molasses Outside of the rum distillery, the most important use of molasses was its use in brewing beer. Molasses beer was said to be cheaper, easier to make, and less alcoholic than commercial beer. This came in handy for people who lacked access to purified drinking water. Molasses became a very important part of family diets and cooking purposes at this time. Although the colonial rum industry was very successful in the eighteenth century, whiskey would soon become its largest competitor. Molasses, however, was also used in the colonies for kitchen purposes, such as for baked beans, brown bread, Indian pudding, pie, and soft drinks. Molasses were also used for curing meat and pickling fish, and for medicinal purposes. New England rum The rum industry in the colonies was limited to the middle colonies and New England. Massachusetts and Rhode Island together made up three-quarters of the mainland's domestic rum exports by the end of the colonial period. By the middle of the eighteenth century, Massachusetts supported sixty-three distilleries, which accounted annually for about 700,000 gallons.Ostrander, 1956 Rhode Island supported around thirty distilleries, and after the Sugar Act was repealed, produced about 500,000 gallons of rum annually.Ostrander, 1956 Other colonies, such as Connecticut, New York, and Pennsylvania also had rum distilleries, but they operated on local terms and did not participate in the large-scale exportation of rum that Massachusetts and Rhode Island were involved in. South of Pennsylvania, there was little interest in rum distillation, as distilleries were very expensive and difficult to build.

Its population increased from 785,000 in 1831 to 1,053,000 in 1848, as the city grew to the north and west, while the poorest neighborhoods in the center became even more crowded. The heart of the city, around the Île de la Cité, was a maze of narrow, winding streets and crumbling buildings from earlier centuries; it was picturesque, but dark, crowded, unhealthy and dangerous. A cholera outbreak in 1832 killed 20,000 people. Claude-Philibert de Rambuteau, prefect of the Seine for fifteen years under Louis-Philippe, made tentative efforts to improve the center of the city: he paved the quays of the Seine with stone paths and planted trees along the river. He built a new street (now the Rue Rambuteau) to connect the Marais district with the markets and began construction of Les Halles, the famous central food market of Paris, finished by Napoleon III. Louis-Philippe lived in his old family residence, the Palais-Royal, until 1832, before moving to the Tuileries Palace. His chief contribution to the monuments of Paris was the completion in 1836 of the Place de la Concorde, which was further embellished on 25 October 1836 by the placement of the Luxor Obelisk. In the same year, at the other end of the Champs-Élysées, Louis-Philippe completed and dedicated the Arc de Triomphe, which had been begun by Napoleon I. The ashes of Napoleon were returned to Paris from Saint Helena in a solemn ceremony on 15 December 1840, and Louis-Philippe built an impressive tomb for them at the Invalides. He also placed the statue of Napoleon on top of the column in the Place Vendôme. In 1840, he completed a column in the Place de la Bastille dedicated to the July 1830 revolution which had brought him to power. He also sponsored the restoration of the Paris churches ruined during the French Revolution, a project carried out by the ardent architectural historian Eugène Viollet-le-Duc; the first church slated for restoration was the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés. Between 1837-1841, he built a new Hôtel de Ville with an interior salon decorated by Eugène Delacroix. The first railway stations in Paris (then called embarcadères) were built under Louis-Philippe. Each belonged to a different company, and they were not connected to each other; all were located outside the city center. The first, the Embarcadère Saint-Germain, was opened on 24 August 1837 on the Place de l'Europe. An early version of the Gare Saint-Lazare was started in 1842, and the first lines from Paris to Orléans and to Rouen were inaugurated on 1–2 May 1843. As the population of Paris grew, so did discontent in the working-class neighborhoods. There were riots in 1830, 1831, 1832, 1835, 1839, and 1840. The 1832 uprising, which followed the funeral of a fierce critic of Louis- Philippe, General Jean Maximilien Lamarque, was immortalized by Victor Hugo in his novel Les Misérables.Manéglier, Hervé, Paris impérial, p. 19 The growing unrest finally exploded on 23 February 1848, when a large demonstration was broken up by the army. Barricades went up in the eastern working-class neighborhoods. The king reviewed his soldiers in front of the Tuileries Palace, but instead of cheering him, many shouted \\"Long Live Reform!\\" Discouraged, he abdicated and departed for exile in England. The Parisians Population The population of Paris grew rapidly during the reign of Louis-Philippe, from 785,866 recorded in the 1831 census, to 899,313 in 1836, and 936,261 in 1841. By 1846, it had grown to 1,053,897. Between 1831 and 1836, it grew by 14.4% within the city limits and by 36.7% in the villages around the city that became part of Paris in 1860. The largest number of immigrants came from the twelve departments around Paris: 40% came from Picardy and the Nord department; 13% from Normandy; and 13% from Burgundy. A smaller number came from Brittany and Provence, and they had greater difficulties assimilating, since few of them spoke French. They tended to settle in the poorest neighborhoods between the Hôtel de Ville and Les Halles. Following earlier foreign immigration, a large wave of immigrants from Poland, including Frédéric Chopin, arrived after the failed Polish revolutions of 1830 and 1848. The most densely populated neighborhoods were in the center, where the poorest Parisians lived: Les Arcis, Les Marchés, Les Lombards and Montorgueil, where the population density reached between 1000 and 1500 persons per hectare. However, during the reign of Louis-Philippe, the middle class gradually moved away from the center toward the west and north of the Grands Boulevards. Between 1831 and 1836, the population of the 23 neighborhoods of the center dropped from 42.7% to 24.5% of the city's population, while the corresponding percentage for the outer neighborhoods grew from 27.3% to 58.7%. The population of the Left Bank remained steady at about 26% of the total. Social classes The nobility, composed of several hundred families, continued to occupy their palatial town houses in the Faubourg Saint-Germain and held a prominent place in society, but exercised a much smaller role in the government and business of the city. Their place at the top of the social order was taken by the bankers, financiers and industrialists. The novelist Stendhal wrote: \\"The bankers are at the heart of the State. The bourgeoisie has taken the place of the Faubourg Saint-Germain, and the bankers are the nobility of the bourgeoisie.\\" The new leaders of Paris lived on the Right Bank, between the Palais Royal and the Madeleine to the north and west of the city. The Rothschild family and the bankers Jacques Laffitte and Casimir Perier lived on the Rue de la Chaussée-d'Antin, north of the Place Vendôme, just outside the boulevards. The industrialist Benjamin Delessert lived on the Rue Montmartre. The upper middle class, those who paid more than 200 francs in direct taxes each year, numbered 15,000 families in a city of about a million inhabitants. The growing middle class also included owners of shops, merchants, artisans, notaries, doctors, lawyers, and government officials. \\"Visiting the Poor\\", from the illustrated French magazine Le Magasin pittoresque (1844) The reign of Louis-Philippe also saw a large increase in the number of working-class Parisians employed in the new factories and workshops created by the Industrial Revolution. A skilled worker earned three to five francs a day. An unskilled worker, such as those employed to use wheelbarrows to move earth during the construction of new streets, earned 40 sous, or two francs, a day. The workers were mostly from the provinces and rented rooms in crowded hôtels garnis, or lodging houses. The population of the lodging houses grew from 23,000 to 50,000 between 1831 and 1846. They constituted the class most subject to the fluctuations of the business cycle and were the principal participants in the growing number of strikes and confrontations with the government. There was also a growing under-class in Paris of the unemployed or marginally employed. These included such occupations as the chiffonniers, who searched the trash at night for rags or old shoes that could be resold. Their number was estimated at 1800 in 1832.Fierro, Alfred, Histoire et Dictionnaire de Paris, (1996), article on Chiffonniers, page 771 There was also a very large number of orphans who lived by any means they could find in the streets of Paris. They are memorably described by Victor Hugo in Les Misérables. The Bohemian A Bohemian of Paris, by Honoré Daumier (1842) A new social type appeared in Paris in the 1840s; le bohème, or the \\"Bohemian\\". They were usually students or artists, and were generally described as joyous, careless about the future, somewhat lazy, boisterous, and scornful of middle-class standards. They wore a distinct costume, careless and flamboyant, to stand out from the crowd. The name was taken from the Romani people who originally immigrated to France from eastern Europe in the 15th century and were mistakenly believed to come specifically from Bohemia; they were numerous in Paris at the time. The character was first introduced into literature by Henri Murger in a series of stories called Scènes de la vie de Bohème (Scenes of Bohemian Life) published in Paris between 1845 and 1849, which in 1896 was made into the opera La Bohème by Puccini. The term spread from Paris to the rest of Europe, and came to be used for anyone who lived an artistic and unconventional life. Prostitution Prostitution was common in Paris. Beginning in 1816, prostitutes were required to register with the police. Between 1816 and 1842, their numbers grew from 22,000 to 43,000. They were mostly young women from the French provinces who had come to Paris seeking regular work, but were unable to find it. At the beginning of the reign of Louis-Philippe, the prostitutes were usually found in the arcades of the Palais-Royal, but they were gradually moved by the police to the sidewalks of the Rue Saint-Denis, the Rue Saint-Honoré, the Rue Sainte-Anne, and the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré. Houses of prostitution, marked with red lanterns, were called maisons de tolerance or maisons closes. They were mostly found on the boulevards at the edges of the city, in Belleville, Ménilmontant, La Villette, La Chapelle, Grenelle, Montparnasse, and at the Place du Trone. They numbered 200 in 1850, just after the fall of Louis-Philippe. Governing Paris King Louis-Philippe in 1841 Claude- Philibert Barthelot de Rambuteau, the Prefect of the Seine under Louis- Philippe Louis-Philippe had a very different style from previous monarchs; he did not move from his residence in the Palais-Royal to the Tuileries Palace until 1 October 1831. Except on ceremonial occasions, he dressed like a banker or industrialist rather than a king, with a blue coat, white waistcoat and top hat, and carried an umbrella. Formal court dress was no longer required at receptions. The royal guards were replaced by soldiers from the National Guard. His children attended the best Paris schools, rather than having tutors. He spent as little time as possible in Paris, preferring the royal residences at Fontainebleau, Versailles and the Château de Neuilly. As soon as he came to power, Louis-Philippe dismissed the old Prefect of the Seine, the Prefect of Police, the mayors of the arrondissements and their deputies, and the 24 members of the General Council of the Seine. On 29 July, he appointed a temporary municipal commission to run the city, under the authority of the Minister of the Interior. The new council was named on 17 September, and was made up mainly of bankers, industrialists, magistrates and senior government officials. The successive French governments since the Ancien Régime had feared the fury of the Parisians, and a repeat of the Reign of Terror. Parisians had not been allowed to elect a city government from 1800 until 1830; it was always directly under the rule of the national government. In 1831, Louis-Philippe organized the first municipal elections, but under conditions that ensured that the Parisians would not get out of control. Under a law of 30 April 1831, the Chamber of Deputies created a new General Council of the Seine, with 36 elected members from Paris, three per arrondissement, and eight from the neighboring arrondissements of Saint-Denis and Sceaux. Only Parisians who paid more than 200 francs a year in direct taxes were allowed to vote, although they numbered less than 15,000 in a city with a population of more than 800,000 persons. A few other selected categories of Parisians were also allowed to vote, including judges, notaries, members of the Institut de France, retired officers who received a pension of at least 1200 francs, and doctors who had practiced in Paris more than ten years. This added another 2000 to the number of eligible voters. Even with all these limitations on who could vote, Louis-Philippe's government feared that Paris could run out of control. The president and vice-president of the Council were named by the king from among the members of the Council. Only the Prefect of the Seine, appointed by the king, could bring business before the Council. Furthermore, a new parallel council was created, made up of the mayors and deputy mayors, which served to bypass the Municipal Council when needed. Despite all these efforts, the Council still demonstrated its independence on occasion. It forced the resignation of the first new Prefect of the Seine, Pierre-Marie Taillepied, Comte de Bondy, who rarely consulted the Council and disregarded their opinions. The new prefect, Claude-Philibert Barthelot de Rambuteau, learned the lesson and treated the Council with great courtesy, summoning them for meetings every week. The Police The other key figure in the government of Paris was the Prefect of Police. There were two of these during the reign of Louis-Philippe: Henri Gisquet (1831-1836) and Gabriel Delessert (1836-1848). The Prefect of Police oversaw the municipal police, the gendarmes in the city, and the firemen. He administered the prisons, hospitals, hospices, and public assistance; was responsible for public health and stopping industrial pollution; and was in charge of street lighting and street cleaning. He was also responsible for traffic circulation, making sure that building façades met city requirements, that unsafe buildings were demolished, and that the city's markets and bakeries were supplied with food and bread. On 16 August 1830, soon after Louis-Philippe assumed the throne, the royal police force of Paris, the gendarmerie royale, was abolished and replaced by the garde municipale de Paris, a force of 1,510 men originally composed of two battalions of infantry and two squadrons of cavalry. They were responsible for suppressing the numerous uprisings and riots between 1831 and 1848. Their numbers were doubled during that time, but their harsh tactics earned them the hatred of the insurgent Parisians; a substantial number of police were massacred by the crowds during the Revolution of 1848. The garde municipale was abolished in 1848 and replaced by the Garde Republicaine. The second corps responsible for maintaining order in the city was the Garde Nationale. At the end of the reign of Charles X, it had rebelled against the monarchy and helped overthrow the king. It was composed largely of the bourgeoisie of Paris, and members provided their own weapons. It had 60,000 members in Paris, though only 20,000 had income high enough to be eligible to vote. The Garde Nationale helped suppress the armed uprisings of 1832 and 1834, but from 1840 they were increasingly hostile to the government of Louis-Philippe. When the Revolution of 1848 broke out, they took the side of the insurgents and helped bring the regime to an end. The cholera epidemic The first great crisis to strike Paris during the reign of Louis-Philippe was an epidemic of cholera in 1832. It was the first such epidemic in France, and the disease was little known or understood. It originated in Asia and spread through Russia, Poland, and Germany before reaching France. The first victim in Paris died on 19 February 1832. At first, the disease was not believed to be contagious, and the epidemic was not officially recognized until 22 March. As news of it spread, thousands of Parisians fled the city. 12,733 Parisians died in April, with a decrease in May and June, and a new surge in July, before the epidemic receded in September. Between March and September, it killed 18,402 Parisians, including Casimir Périer, the president of Louis-Philippe's Council of Ministers, who caught the disease after visiting cholera patients in hospital. The disease was most fatal in the overcrowded neighborhoods of the center of Paris. As one measure of how crowded conditions were, there is record of one lodging house at 26 Rue Saint-Lazare where 492 persons lived in the same building, with less than one square meter of space per person. A rumor spread in the poor areas that the cholera had been spread deliberately to \\"assassinate the people\\". One of the victims of the epidemic was General Lamarque, a former general of the Napoleonic era, who died on June 1. He was seen as a defender of popular causes, and his funeral was the scene of a large anti-government demonstration, with some barricades going up in the streets. These events were immortalized in Victor Hugo's novel Les Misérables. The incumbent Prefect of the Seine was dismissed largely because of his inept handling of the epidemic, and the new Prefect, the Count of Rambuteau, declared his intention to bring \\"air and light\\" to the center of the city to prevent future epidemics. This was the beginning of the program to open up the center of the city, not fully realized until the time of Napoleon III and Baron Haussmann. Monuments and architecture A huge crowd watched as the Luxor Obelisk was hoisted into place on the Place de la Concorde on 25 October 1836. One of the great architectural projects of the reign of Louis-Philippe was the remaking of the Place de la Concorde. An equestrian statue of King Louis XV had originally been the centerpiece of the Place; during the Revolution the statue was pulled down and replaced by a statue of the Goddess of Liberty and the place was the site of the execution of King Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette. Louis Philippe wanted to erase all the revolutionary associations of site. He selected Jacques Ignace Hittorff to design a new master plan, which was carried out in stages between 1833 and 1846. First the moat of the Tuileries Palace was filled in. Then Hittorff designed the two Fontaines de la Concorde, one commemorating river navigation and commerce, the other maritime navigation and commerce. On 25 October 1836, a new centerpiece was put in place: a stone obelisk from Luxor that weighed 250 tons and was brought to France on a specially-built ship from Egypt. It was slowly hoisted into place in the presence of Louis-Philippe and a huge crowd. At each angle of the square's extended octagon Hittorff placed a statue representing a French city: Bordeaux, Brest, Lille, Lyon, Marseille, Nantes, Rouen and Strasbourg. The face of the statue of Strasbourg, by the sculptor James Pradier, was said to be modeled after Juliette Drouet, the companion of Victor Hugo.*Beatrice de Andia (editor), Paris et ses Fontaines, de la Renaissance a nos jours, Collection Paris et son Patrimoine, Paris, 1995 In the same year, the Arc de Triomphe, begun in 1804 by Napoleon, was finally completed and dedicated. Many old soldiers from the Napoleonic armies were in the crowd, and they called out \\"Vive l'Empereur\\", but Louis-Philippe was unperturbed. The ashes of Napoleon were returned to Paris from Saint Helena in 1840, and were placed with great ceremony in a tomb designed by Louis Visconti beneath the church of Les Invalides. Another Paris landmark, the July Column on the Place de la Bastille, was inaugurated on 28 July 1840, on the anniversary of the July Revolution, and dedicated to those killed during the uprising. Several older monuments were put to new purposes: the Élysée Palace was purchased by the French state and became an official residence; and under later governments, it has served as the residence of the Presidents of the French Republic. The Basilica of Sainte-Geneviève, originally built as a church beginning in the 1750s, then made into a mausoleum for great Frenchmen during the French Revolution, then a church again during the Bourbon Restoration, once again became the Panthéon, dedicated to the glory of great Frenchmen. The beginning of architectural restoration The Sainte-Chapelle undergoing restoration (1839) During the reign of Louis-Philippe a movement was launched to preserve and restore some of the earliest landmarks of Paris, many of which had been badly damaged during the Revolution. It was inspired in large part by Victor Hugo's hugely successful novel The Hunchback of Notre Dame (Notre-Dame de Paris), published in 1831. The leading figure of the restoration movement was Prosper Mérimée, named by Louis-Philippe as the inspector General of Historic Monuments. In 1842, he compiled the first official list of classified historical monuments, now known as the Base Mérimée. In addition to saving architectural landmarks, he participated with his friend the novelist George Sand in the discovery of The Lady and the Unicorn tapestries at the Château de Boussac in the Limousin in central France; they are now the best-known possessions of the Cluny Museum in Paris. He also wrote the novella Carmen on which the opera of Bizet was based. The first structure to be restored was the nave of the church of Saint-Germain- des-Prés, the oldest in the city. Work also began in 1843 on the cathedral of Notre Dame, which had been stripped of the statues on its facade and of its spire. Much of the work was directed by the architect and historian Eugene Viollet-le-Duc who sometimes admitted that he was guided by his own scholarship of the \\"spirit\\" of medieval architecture, rather strict historical accuracy. The other major restorations projects were devoted to the medieval Sainte Chapelle and the Hôtel de Ville, which dated from the 17th century. The old buildings that pressed up against the back of the Hôtel de Ville were cleared away, two new wings were added, the interiors were lavishly redecorated, and the ceilings and walls of the grands salons were painted with murals by Eugène Delacroix. Unfortunately, all the interiors were burned in 1871 by the Paris Commune. Rebuilding the city center and the boulevards Rambuteau, during this fifteen years as Prefect of the Seine, made attempts to solve the blockage of traffic and the unhealthiness of the streets in the center, particularly after the cholera epidemic in the heart of the city. He opened the Rue d'Arcole and the Rue Soufflot and built what is now the Rue Rambuteau, thirteen meters wide, to connect the Le Marais district to the markets of Les Halles. He rebuilt what became known as the Pont Louis-Philippe from the Place de Gréve to the Île Saint-Louis and completely rebuilt the Pont des Saints-Pères. The île Louviers, just east of the Île Saint-Louis, used as a lumber yard, was attached to the Right Bank, and the Boulevard Morland replaced the narrow branch of the Seine that had separated the island from the city. The Pont d'Austerlitz, originally named for a Napoleonic military victory, the renamed the Pont du Jardin du Roi during the Bourbon Restoration, took back its Napoleonic name. The Quai de la Tournelle and the banks of the Seine at the Louvre and Quai des Grands-Augustins were walled with stone and planted with trees. At the beginning of the reign of Louis-Philippe, the old ramparts and bastions of Louis XIV were still visible in many places around the city, with a footpath running along the top. Rambuteau had them leveled in order to widen and straighten the Grands Boulevards. Only short sections of raised sidewalks on the Boulevard Saint-Martin and Boulevard de Bonne-Nouvelle showed how the ramparts formerly appeared (and they still show this today). Rambuteau also began rebuilding the old central market of Les Halles, but the new buildings, heavy and old-fashioned, did not please the Parisians. The project was later stopped by Napoleon III when he was still prince-president of France (1848-1851). New glass and iron buildings were designed and built in their place by the architect Victor Baltard. Sidewalks and public toilets At the beginning of the reign of Louis-Philippe, Paris sidewalks in the center of the city, if they existed at all, were very narrow, rarely wide enough for two persons to walk side by side. Travelers described the adventure of trying to walk through the streets of the Île-de-la-Cité on a narrow, crowded sidewalk, the danger of stepping into the street in the path of carts, wagons and carriages, and the noise of the carriage wheels echoing on the walls of the street. Sidewalks were common only in the new neighborhoods to the west and north and on the Grands Boulevards. In 1836, Rambuteau launched a project to build sidewalks in more neighborhoods and replace the old sidewalks made of lava stone with asphalt. By the end of the reign of Louis-Philippe, a majority of Paris streets were paved. Under Napoleon III, Haussmann completed the sidewalks by adding granite edges. Rambuteau also addressed the absence of public urinals, which gave the side streets and parks a particular and unpleasant smell. The first public urinals had been installed during the Bourbon Restoration, just before the Revolution of July 1830, but they were dismantled and used for barricades during the street fighting. In July 1839, Rambuteau authorized the construction of a new circular type of urinal, ten to twelve feet high, made of masonry with a pointed roof and posters displayed on the outside. The first ones were placed on the Boulevard Montmartre and the Boulevard des Italiens. By 1843, there were 468 urinals in place. They became known as vespasiennes after the Roman Emperor Vespasian, who was said to have installed public toilets in ancient Rome. They were all replaced during the Second Empire by a newer cast-iron design. The Thiers Wall A late 19th- century photo of the Thiers Wall The city walls of Paris had been demolished during the reign of Louis XIV, and in 1814, the city was easily captured near the end of the War of the Sixth Coalition, since it had no fortifications. Debates began in Paris as early as 1820 about the necessity of building a new wall. In 1840, as the result of tensions between France, Britain and the German states, the discussion was renewed, and a plan was put forward by Adolphe Thiers, the President of the Council and the Minister of Foreign Affairs. The Thiers Wall, approved on 3 April 1841, was 34 kilometers long and composed of a belt of ramparts and trenches 140 meters wide. The highest rampart was ten meters high and three meters wide, and a road six meters wide ran the full length of the wall. It was forbidden to build any structure in a space 250 meters wide in front of the wall. The wall was reinforced at regular intervals with a series of bastions and 16 large forts around the city. In 1860, the route of the wall marked the official city limits of Paris, and it remains so, with a few changes, today. A number of the bastions still exist, and vestiges of the wall can still be seen at the Porte d'Arcueil (in the 14th arrondissement) and the point at which the Canal Saint-Denis passed through the wall. The Boulevard Périphérique around the city follows the route of the old Thiers wall. Social reforms and education Rambuteau also made attempts to improve the social institutions of the city. He built a new prison, La Roquette, for criminals, while the mentally ill and sick were separated and left in the Bicêtre Hospital. Women prisoners were sent to the Enclos Saint- Lazare. Rambuteau began building the Lariboisière Hospital (in the 10th arrondissement), and he reorganized the Mont-de-Piété, a charitable organization which gave low-cost loans to the poor. In addition, he increased the number of savings banks for workers and middle-class Parisians. Primary education had previously been the responsibility of the Church, and many children remained illiterate. Under Louis-Philippe's minister of education, François Guizot, primary school was made obligatory as of 28 June 1833. A system of communal and mutual schools was created, as well as two higher primary schools: the Collège Chaptal (now Lycée Chaptal) and the Turgot School (1839). All of the primary schools, both Catholic and secular, were put under the authority of a central committee on education, with the Prefect as president. Water and fountains The canals that brought drinking water to Paris, begun by Napoleon, were extended, and Rambuteau increased the number of borne-fontaines, small water fountains 50 centimeters high with a simple spout, from 146 in 1830 to 2,000 in 1848. Despite the rapid growth of the city, no new sources of water were developed. The wealthiest Parisians had wells in their residences, usually in the basement. Most Parisians obtained their drinking water in a traditional way by visiting the city's fountains, sending servants to the fountains, or buying water from the water porters, mostly men from Auvergne and Piedmont, who carried large buckets balanced on a pole on their shoulders. During the reign of Louis-Philippe, five new monumental fountains were erected in the center of the city: the two fountains designed by Jacques Ignace Hittorff in the Place de la Concorde; the Fontaine Molière on the Rue de Richelieu designed by Louis Visconti (who also designed the tomb of Napoleon); the Fontaine Louvois on the Square Louvois, designed by Visconti on the site of the old opera house; and the Fontaine Saint-Sulpice, also by Visconti, at the center of the Place Saint-Sulpice.

The first successful passenger railway line in France had opened between Saint-Étienne and Lyon in 1831. The financiers, the Péreire brothers, built the first line from Paris to Saint-Germain-en-Laye between 1835 and 1837, largely in order to persuade the banking community and the Parisians that such a means of transport was feasible and profitable. The line between Paris and Versailles was approved on 9 July 1836; it was the site of the first railroad accident in France on 8 May 1842, in which at least 55 passengers were killed and between 100 and 200 injured, The accident did not slow down the growth of the railroads: the Paris-Orléans line opened on 2 May 1843, and the line between Paris and Rouen was inaugurated the next day. The first train stations in Paris were called embarcadéres (a term borrowed from river navigation)), and their location was a source of great contention, since each railroad line was owned by a different company, and each went in a different direction. The first embarcadére was built by the Péreire brothers for the line Paris-Saint- Germain-en-Laye, at the Place de l'Europe; it opened on 26 August 1837. It became so successful that it was quickly replaced by a larger building on the Rue de Stockholm, and then an even larger structure, the beginning of the Gare Saint-Lazare, built between 1841 and 1843. It was the station for the trains to Saint-Germain-en-Laye, Versailles and Rouen. The Péreire brothers argued that Gare Saint-Lazare should be the only railway station in Paris, but the owners of the other lines each insisted on having their own station. The first Gare d'Orléans, now known as the Gare d'Austerlitz, was opened on 2 May 1843 and was greatly expanded in 1848 and 1852. The first Gare Montparnasse opened on 10 September 1840 on the Avenue du Maine and was the terminus of the new Paris-Versailles line on the Left Bank of the Seine. It was quickly found to be too small and was rebuilt between 1848 and 1852 at the junction of the Rue de Rennes and Boulevard du Montparnasse, its present location. The banker James Mayer de Rothschild received the permission of the government to build the first railroad line from Paris to the Belgian border in 1845, with branch lines to Calais and Dunkerque. The first embarcadére of the new line opened on the Rue de Dunkerque in 1846. It was replaced by a much grander station, the Gare du Nord, in 1854. The first station of the line to eastern France, the Gare de l'Est, was begun in 1847, but not finished until 1852. Construction of a new station for the line to the south, from Paris to Montereau-Fault-Yonne began in 1847 and was finished in 1852. In 1855, it was replaced by a new station, the first Gare de Lyon, on the same site. The Economy Industry The Industrial Revolution steadily changed the economy and the appearance of Paris, as new factories were built along the Seine and in the outer neighborhoods of the city. The textile industry was in decline, but the chemical industry was expanding around the edges of the city, at Javel, Grenelle, Passy, Clichy, Belleville and Pantin. It was joined by mills and factories that made steel, machines and tools, especially for the new railroad industry. Paris ranked third in France in metallurgy, after Saint-Étienne and the Nord department. Between 1830 and 1847, twenty percent of all the steam engines produced in France were made in Paris. Many of these were produced at the locomotive factory built by Jean-François Cail in 1844, first at Chaillot, then at Grenelle, which became one of the largest enterprises in Paris. One example of the new factories in Paris was the cigarette and cigar factory of Philippon, between the rue de l'Université and the Quai d'Orsay. Napoleon's soldiers had brought the habit of smoking from Spain, and it had spread among all classes of Parisians. The government had a monopoly on the manufacture of tobacco products, and the government-owned factory opened in 1812. It employed 1,200 workers, a large number of them women, and also included a school and laboratory, run by the École Polytechnique, to develop new methods of tobacco production. Despite the surge of industrialization, most Parisian workers were employed in small workshops and enterprises. In 1847, there were 350,000 workers in Paris employed in 65,000 businesses. Only seven thousand businesses employed more than ten workers. For example, in 1848 there were 377 small workshops in Paris that made and sold umbrellas, employing a total of 1,442 workers. Banking and Finance La Bourse, the Paris stock exchange (1831) With the surge of industrialization, the importance of banking and finance in the Paris economy also grew. As Stendhal wrote at the time, the bankers were the new aristocracy of Paris. In 1837, Jacques Laffitte founded the first business bank in Paris, the Caisse Générale du Commerce et de l'Industrie. In 1842, Hippolyte Ganneron founded a rival commercial bank, the Comptoir Général du Commerce. The banks provided the funding for the most important economic event of the reign of Louis-Philippe: the arrival of the railroads. The brothers Émile and Issac Péreire, the grandchildren of an immigrant from Portugal, founded the first railway line to Paris. James Mayer de Rothschild, the chief rival of the Péreire brothers, was the most famous banker of during the reign of Louis-Philippe. He gave loans to the royal government and played a key role in the construction of the French mining industry and railroad network. In 1838, he purchased the house of Charles Maurice de Talleyrand at 2 Rue Saint-Florentin on the Place de la Concorde for his Paris residence. He became a leading figure in Paris society and the arts; his personal chef was Marie-Antoine Carême, one of the most famous names in French cuisine.Crème du Carême He patronized many of the leading artists of the time, including Gioacchino Rossini, Frédéric Chopin, Honoré de Balzac, Eugène Delacroix, and Heinrich Heine. Chopin dedicated his Ballade No. 4 in F minor, Op. 52 (1843), and his Valse in C-sharp minor, Op. 64, N° 2 (1847), to Rothschild's daughter Charlotte. In 1848, Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres painted his wife's portrait. Boutiques and luxury goods Galerie d'Orléans of the Palais-Royal in 1840 The reign of Louis-Philippe became known as \\"the reign of the boutique\\". During this period, Paris continued to be the marketplace of luxury goods for the wealthiest customers in Europe, and the leader in fashion. The perfumer Pierre-François-Pascal Guerlain had opened his first shop on the Rue de Rivoli in 1828. In 1840, he opened a larger shop at 145 Rue de la Paix, which was also the first street in Paris to be lit with gaslight. The porcelain factory at Sèvres, which had long made table settings for the royal courts of Europe, began to make them for the bankers and industrialists of Paris. The Passage des Panoramas and other covered shopping galleries were ancestors of the modern shopping center. Another new kind of store was the magasin de nouveautés, or novelty store. The \\"Grand Colbert\\" in the Galerie Colbert on the Rue Vivienne was decorated and organized like an oriental bazaar; it had large plate-glass windows and window displays, fixed prices and price tags, and sold a wide variety of products for women, from cashmere and lace to hosiery and hats. It was an ancestor of the first modern department stores, which appeared in Paris in the 1850s. Other novel marketing techniques were introduced in Paris at this time: the illuminated sign, and advertising goods in newspapers. The arrival of the railroad made it possible for people from the provinces to come to Paris simply to shop. Daily Life Transportation The first means of public transport, the omnibus, had been introduced in Paris in January 1828, and it enjoyed great success. It used large horse-drawn coaches, was entered from the rear, and could carry between twelve and eighteen passengers. The fare was 25 centimes. The omnibuses operated between seven in the morning and seven in the evening in most location, but operated until midnight on the Grands Boulevards. In 1830, there were ten omnibus companies; by 1840, the number had increased to thirteen operating omnibuses on 23 different lines, though half of the passengers were carried by one company, Stanislas Baudry's Entreprise Générale des Omnibus de Paris (EGO). The other common means of transport was the fiacre, the taxicab of its day. It was a small box-like coach that carried as many as four passengers; it could be hired at designated stations around Paris. A single journey cost 30 sous, regardless of distance; or they could be hired at the rate of 45 sous for an hour. The drivers expected a tip, and, according to a guidebook of 1842, became extremely unpleasant if they did not receive one. Food and drink The staples of the Parisian diet, unchanged since the 18th century, were bread, meat and wine. Upper-class Parisians began the day with coffee and bread, then they had their déjeuner (lunch) at mid- day, often at a café; they often started with oysters, followed by beefsteaks, vegetables, fruit, dessert and coffee. The meal was accompanied by wine, often diluted with water. They had their dinner at six or seven in the evening, with a larger number of dishes. They often went to the theater afterwards, then went to a café following the performance for coffee and drinks or a light supper. For working-class Parisians, bread composed seven-eighths of their diet. They accompanied it with whatever fruit might be in season, some white cheese, and, in winter, some pieces of pork or bacon, along with stewed pears or roasted apples. They usually had some sort of soup each night, and on Sunday traditionally ate a stew called pot-au-feu. The meals were always accompanied by wine, usually with water added. The economic difficulties for ordinary Parisians during the reign of Louis-Philippe can be illustrated by their meat consumption; between 1772 and 1872, Parisians consistently ate about sixty kilograms of meat per year per person, but meat consumption between 1831 and 1850 fell to about fifty kilograms. Bathing The Chinese Baths on the Boulevard des Capucines (1848) Only a small number of Parisians had indoor plumbing or bathtubs; for most, water for washing had to be carried from a fountain or purchased from a water-bearer and stored in a container, and was used sparingly. Paris had a number of bath houses, including some, such as the Chinese Baths on the Boulevard des Italiens, which catered to upper-class customers. A floating bath and school of swimming for women on the Quai d'Anjou (1846) For the working class, there was a row of floating baths along the Seine between the Pont d'Austerlitz and the Pont d'Iéna that operated during the summer. These were basins of river water surrounded by fences and usually by floating arcades of changing rooms. They were open day and night for an admission fee of four sous or twenty centimes. They had separate sections for men and women, and bathing costumes could be rented. They were often condemned by the church and in the press as an offense to public morality, but were always crowded with young working-class Parisians on hot summer days. Some of the floating baths were designed for wealthier patrons, some were used as schools to teach swimming, and some were reserved for women only; one was located in front of the Hôtel Lambert on the Quai d'Anjou. The Press The Paris newspaper market in 1848 At the beginning of the reign of LouisiPhilippe, the city's newspapers were expensive, had very small circulations, contained very little news, and were read mostly at cafés. That changed dramatically on 1 July 1836 with the debut of La Presse, the first inexpensive daily newspaper in Paris. It soon inspired many imitators. Between 1830 and 1848, the circulation of newspapers in Paris doubled; in 1848, there were 25 newspapers in the city with a total circulation of 150,000. Despite official censorship, they played an increasing role in French politics and in the events that culminated in the Revolution of 1848. The press also began to play a novel role in commerce: Paris stores and shops began to advertise their products in the newspapers. A caricature of Louis- Philippe as Gargantua sent Honoré Daumier to prison for six months (1832) Illustrated newspapers, often with satirical cartoons, also became popular and influential. The journalist Charles Philipon started an illustrated weekly magazine called La Caricature in 1830. He used the new technique of lithography to reproduce cartoons and employed a young caricaturist from Marseille, Honoré Daumier. Balzac, a friend of Philipon, also contributed to the magazine, using a pseudonym. In 1832, encouraged by the success of the magazine, he began a more popular daily four-page illustrated satirical newspaper called Le Charivari with caricatures by Daumier. It began with social satire, but soon veered into politics, ridiculing, among other targets, the king. In 1832, Daumier published a caricature of Louis-Phillippe as Gargantua eating the wealth of the nation, and another of the king's face in the shape of a pear. Daumier was arrested and served six months in prison. Philipon also served six months in prison for \\"contempt of the king's person.\\" By 1835, the newspaper staff had been taken to court seven times and convicted four times. La Caricature ceased publication and Charivari switched from political to social satire, but the ridicule of the regime by the press continued to undermine public support for Louis-Philippe. Numerous revolutionary newspapers were published in Paris by exiled political activists, then smuggled into their own countries. From 1843 to 1845, Karl Marx lived in Paris as editor of two radical German newspapers: Deutsch–Französische Jahrbücher and Vorwärts!. It was in a café at the Palais- Royal that he met his future collaborator, Friedrich Engels. He was expelled from France in 1845 at the request of the Prussian government and moved to Brussels. Culture, Arts and Amusement Museums The Hôtel Cluny in 1839. It became the Museum of the Middle Ages in 1843. On 8 November 1833, a new museum of coins and medals was opened inside the Hôtel des Monnaies, the 18th-century French mint on the Left Bank. Interest in the Middle Ages increased greatly in Paris after the publication of Victor Hugo's Notre-Dame de Paris and the first restoration of the cathedral. Alexandre Du Sommerard was a former soldier in Napoleon's army who became a counselor at the Cour des Comptes. He assembled and classified a large collection of art objects from the Middle Ages and Renaissance and purchased the Hôtel de Cluny, which he made his residence and private gallery to display his collection. After Du Sommerard's death in 1843, the French state bought the building and his collection, and the Hôtel de Cluny and the Roman baths adjacent to it became the Museum of the Middle Ages. Literature Many of the greatest and most popular works of French literature were written and published in Paris during the reign of Louis-Philippe. *Victor Hugo published four volumes of poetry, and in 1831 published Notre-Dame de Paris (the Hunchback of Notre-Dame), which was quickly translated into English and other European languages. The great popularity of the novel launched a movement for the restoration of the cathedral and other medieval monuments in Paris. In 1841, Louis-Philippe made Hugo a peer of France, a ceremonial position with a seat in the upper house of the French parliament (the Chamber of Peers). Hugo spoke out against the death penalty and for freedom of speech. While living in his house on the Place Royale (now the Place des Vosges), he began working on his next novel, Les Misérables. *François-René de Chateaubriand refused to swear allegiance to Louis-Philippe and instead secluded himself in his apartment at 120 Rue du Bac, where he wrote his most famous work, the Mémoires d'outre-tombe, which was not published until after his death. He died in Paris on 4 July 1848, during the French Revolution of 1848. * After writing several novels, Honoré de Balzac in 1832 conceived the idea of a series of books that would paint a panoramic portrait of \\"all aspects of society,\\" eventually called La Comédie Humaine. He declared to his sister, \\"I am about to become a genius.\\" He published Eugénie Grandet, his first bestseller, in 1833, followed by Le Père Goriot in 1835, the two-volume Illusions perdues in 1843, Splendeurs et misères des courtisanes and Le Cousin Pons in 1847 and La Cousine Bette 1848. In each of the novels, Paris is the setting and a major participant. * The highly prolific Alexandre Dumas, père, published The Three Musketeers in 1844; Twenty Years After and La Reine Margot in 1845; The Count of Monte Cristo in 1845–1846; La Dame de Monsoreau in 1846; The Vicomte de Bragelonne in 1847; The Vicomte de Bragelonne in 1847; and many more novels in addition to many theatrical versions of his novels for the Paris stage. *Stendhal published his first major novel, Le Rouge et le Noir, in 1830, and his second, La Chartreuse de Parme, in 1839. Other major Paris writers of the July Monarchy included George Sand, Alfred de Musset, and Alphonse de Lamartine. The poet Charles Baudelaire, born in Paris, published his first works, essays of art criticism.

It was dominated for most of the reign of Louis-Philippe by the romantic painters. The most prominent figure in painting was Eugène Delacroix, whose romantic paintings portrayed historical, patriotic and religious subjects. His most famous painting of the period, Liberty Leading the People (La Liberté guidant le peuple), an allegory of the 1830 revolution, was purchased by the French state, but was considered to be too inflammatory to be shown in public until 1848. Other prominent artists whose work appeared in the Paris Salon included Théodore Chassériau and Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, who had been a prominent figure in French painting since the reign of Napoleon I. A new generation of artists made their appearance in the 1840s, led by Gustave Courbet, who exhibited his Self-Portrait with a Black Dog at the Paris Salon in 1844. His arrival as the leader of the realist movement did not come until after the 1848 Revolution.

The most famous was Frédéric Chopin, who arrived in Paris from Poland in September 1831 at the age of twenty-one and never returned to his homeland after the Polish uprising against Russian rule in October 1831 was crushed. Chopin gave his first concert in Paris at the Salle Pleyel on 26 February 1832 and remained in the city for most of the next seventeen years, until his death in October 1849. He gave just 30 public performances during those years, preferring to give recitals in private salons instead. He earned his living mainly from commissions given by wealthy patrons, including the wife of James Mayer de Rothschild, the publication of his compositions, and from private piano lessons. Chopin lived at different times at 38 Rue de la Chaussée-d'Antin and at 5 Rue Tronchet. He had a ten-year relationship with the writer George Sand between 1837 and 1847. In 1842, they moved together to the Square d'Orléans, at 80 Rue Taitbout, where the relationship ended. Franz Liszt also lived in Paris during this period, composing music for the piano and giving concerts and music lessons. He lived at the Hôtel de France on the Rue La Fayette, not far from Chopin. The two men were friends, but Chopin did not appreciate the manner in which Liszt played variations on his music. The violinist Niccolò Paganini was a frequent visitor and performer in Paris. In 1836, he made an unfortunate investment in a Paris casino and went bankrupt. He was forced to sell his collection of violins to pay his debts. The French composer Hector Berlioz had come to Paris from Grenoble in 1821 to study medicine, which he abandoned for music in 1824, attending the Paris Conservatory in 1826; he won the Prix de Rome for his compositions in 1830. He was working on his most famous work, the Symphonie Fantastique, at the time of the July 1830 revolution. It had its premiere on 4 December 1830. Charles Gounod, born in Paris in 1818, was studying composition during the reign of Louis-Philippe, but had not yet written the opera Faust and his other best known works. Photography The Boulevard du Temple as photographed by Louis Daguerre in 1838. View of the Boulevard du Temple is one of the earliest photos to show a person: a man who is having his shoes shined. Paris was the birthplace of modern photography. A process for capturing images on plates coated with light-sensitive chemicals had been discovered by Nicéphore Niépce in 1826 or 1827 in rural France. After this death in 1833, the process was refined by the Paris artist and entrepreneur Louis Daguerre, who had invented the Paris Diorama. His new method of photography, called the daguerrotype, was publicly announced to a joint meeting of the French Academy of Sciences and the Academy of Fine Arts in Paris on 19 August 1839. Daguerre gave the rights to the invention to the French nation, which offered them for free to any user in the world. In exchange, Daguerre received a pension from the French state. The daguerrotype became the most common method of photography during the 1840s and 1850s. Theater and the Boulevard du Crime Jean-Gaspard Deburau as Pierrot at the Théâtre des Funambules c. 1830. Parisians of all classes frequented the theater during the July Monarchy, lining up to see operas, dramas, comedies, melodramas, vaudeville and farce. Tickets ranged in price from ten francs for the best seats at the Italian Opera to 30 sous for a seat in the \\"paradis\\" the highest balcony, in one of the popular melodrama or variety theaters. These were the most important venues for theater in Paris in the 1830s and 1840s: *Italian opera was performed under the auspices of the Théâtre-Italien at the Théâtre de la Renaissance on the Rue Méhul and Rue Neuve des Petits-Champs. It had two thousand seats, and all the singers and musicians were Italian. *French opera was performed under the auspices of the Académie Royale de Musique on the Rue Le Pelletier, near the Théâtre-Italien. *The Opéra-Comique performed at the Salle Favart, located on what is now called the Place Boïeldieu, and presented lighter operatic works. Portrait of Mlle Rachel by William Etty, from the 1840s *The Comédie Française performed at the Salle Richelieu on the Rue Richelieu. Its most famous dramatic star during the reign of Louis-Philippe was Mademoiselle Rachel (see below). *The Odéon theater presented classical drama and comedy in competition with the Comédie Française. In the 1840s, its most famous star was Mademoiselle Georges who had been the leading actress of Paris theater during the First Empire and the Bourbon Restoration. *The Théâtre du Gymnase on the Boulevard Bonne Nouvelle specialized in farce. Its most famous actor was Bouffé, considered the greatest comic actor of the period. *The Théâtre du Vaudeville stood on the Place de la Bourse, facing the stock exchange, and was known for light comedy. *The Théâtre de la Porte Saint-Martin, located on the Boulevard Saint- Martin, was known for melodrama and burlesque; its most famous star in the 1830s and 1840s was Frédérick Lemaître. *The Théâtre de l'Ambigu-Comique on the Boulevard Saint-Martin specialized in melodrama and vaudeville. Frédérick Lemaître as Don César de Bazan (1844) In addition to these stages, there was a separate group of five theaters, mostly for working class audiences, together on the Boulevard du Temple: the Cirque Olympique, the Folies-Dramatiques, the Théâtre de la Gaîté, the Théâtre des Funambules, and the Théâtre Saqui. They were best known for melodramas, giving that section of the street the nickname the Boulevard du Crime. The most famous theater of that group was the Funambules, known for its performances of the Pierrot mime Jean-Gaspard Deburau, who performed there from 1819 until 1846. He and his cultural milieu were memorably portrayed in the 1945 film by Marcel Carné, Les Enfants du Paradis (The Children of the Paradise). The most famous female dramatic star of the Paris theater was Rachel Félix, better known as \\"Mademoiselle Rachel\\", a German actress who had come to the Comédie Française in Paris in 1830, and became celebrated for her dramatic roles in works of Jean Racine, Voltaire, and Pierre Corneille, particularly as Phèdre in Racine's play of the same name. The most famous male actor was Frédérick Lemaître, who gained fame by transforming a serious dramatic role, that of Robert Macaire, into a burlesque role. During the reign of Louis-Philippe, he starred in Victor Hugo's play Ruy Blas, and in the Balzac's play Vautrin. The latter play was promptly banned by royal censors, because his wig closely resembled that of Louis-Philippe. Restaurants, cafes Parisians outside the Café Tortoni on the Boulevard des Italiens (1835) The restaurant district of the Boulevard des Italiens in the 1840s At the beginning of the reign of Louis-Philippe, the most celebrated restaurants were found in the arcades of the Palais-Royal, but by 1845, the Grands Boulevards, where the theaters were located, had become the main restaurant district. The most famous and expensive restaurants in the city were lined up along the Boulevard des Italiens: the Café Anglais at no. 13; the Café Riche at no. 16; the Maison dorée at no. 20; and the Café de Paris at no. 22. It was also the home of the Café Tortoni, known for its Italian ice creams and pastries. The Café Anglais was a frequent meeting place of the characters in Balzac's series of novels, La Comédie humaine. The Guinguettes Guinguettes created popular diversions for all classes of Parisians, especially on Sundays. They were taverns or cabarets mostly located just outside the city limits, where taxes on wine and spirits were lower; the greatest concentrations were in Montmartre, Belleville, Montrouge, and just outside the city customs tollhouses of Barrière d’Enfer, Maine, Montparnasse, Courtille, Trois Couronnes, Ménilmontant, Les Amandiers, and Vaugirard. They usually had musicians and dancing on Sundays, and Parisians often brought their whole families. There were 367 in 1830, of which 138 were in the city itself and 229 in the suburbs. In 1834, there were l496, of which 235 were in Paris and 261 outside the city limits. Amusement parks and pleasure gardens The Jardin Turc in 1831 Amusement parks had been very popular during the Bourbon Restoration, but went into a decline during the reign of Louis-Philippe. They were summer gardens that offered food, drinks, music, dancing, acrobats, fireworks and other entertainments for an entry fee. They went into a decline as real estate prices rose and the valuable land was sold for building lots. The best known, the Nouveau Tivoli, at 88 Rue de Clichy, closed in 1842. The Jardin Turc on the Rue du Temple, a popular café and summer garden, continued until the early 20th century. The panorama and the diorama A panorama was a very large realistic painting of a city or natural wonder, displayed in a circular building so that viewers, on a platform in the center, felt they were seeing real thing. The first panoramas had been introduced by the American engineer and entrepreneur Robert Fulton in the Passage des Panoramas on the Rue Montmartre in 1799. In 1831, the French inventor Jacques Daguerre invented the diorama, a display of two similar paintings lit by a moving lamp in such a way as to create the illusion of three dimensions. The building in which the diorama was located burned in 1839, and Daguerre turned his attention to developing the new technology of photography. A new theater for panoramas was built in 1839 by the architect Jacques Ignace Hittorff at the Carré Marigny on the Champs-Élysées to display Jean-Charles Langlois's monumental historical painting, The Burning of Moscow in 1812. The building, still standing, is now a theater located next to the Grand Palais.

The first riot took place in December 1830, after the trial of the ministers of King Charles X; the crowd was furious that they were given life sentences instead of the death penalty. More riots took place in 1831 to protest a memorial service held at the church of Saint- Germain-l'Auxerrois for the Duke of Berry, a prominent monarchist who had been assassinated on 14 February 1820 during the reign of King Louis XVIII. The interior of the church was pillaged, and the next day, the rioters attacked the church of Notre-Dame de Bonne-Nouvelle and the palace of the archbishop of Paris, next to the cathedral of Notre-Dame. The archbishop's residence was badly damaged and ultimately demolished. On 4 June 1832, the funeral procession of General Lamarque, an anti-monarchist army officer popular with the students who had died of cholera, was turned into a massive demonstration against the government; the protesters chanted \\"Long live the Republic!\\" and \\"Down with the Bourbons!\\". About 4000 students, workers and their supporters put up barricades in the narrow streets of the quarters of Les Lombards, Arcis, Sainte-Avoye and the Hôtel de Ville. They took control of the area of the city between Bastille and Les Halles, but there was little public support outside these neighborhoods. Despite fierce resistance from the students and workers, the rebellious area was gradually reduced by the army to the streets around cloister of Saint-Merri and crushed on 6 June. The state of emergency lasted until 29 June. 5000 persons were arrested, but only 82 were sentenced; seven were sentenced to death, with the sentences finally reduced to deportation. This event became a dramatic episode in Victor Hugo's novel Les Misérables. There were more demonstrations the following year, with the red flag raised on the Pont d'Austerlitz, more barricades raised in the Saint- Merri neighborhood and two days of fighting between government forces and revolutionaries. There were more riots and barricades in the same neighborhood in the spring of 1834; soldiers attacked a building from which they said shots had been fired and killed many of the demonstrators inside. The 1835 attempt to assassinate Louis-Philippe on the Boulevard du Temple The most dramatic attack on the government took place on 28 July 1835, the anniversary of the July Revolution of 1830. Louis-Philippe and his generals conducted a grand review of the army and National Guard lined up along the Grand Boulevards. At one o'clock in the afternoon, as Louis-Philippe and his entourage were passing the Café Turc on the Boulevard du Temple, an \\"infernal machine\\" of multiple gun barrels was fired from a window. Maréchal Mortier, duc de Trévise, riding with the king, was killed, and six generals, two colonels, nine officers and 21 spectators were wounded, some mortally. The king was grazed by a projectile, but gave the order to continue the parade. The organizer of the attack, Giuseppe Marco Fieschi, and his two accomplices were arrested and later guillotined. These were not the last attacks on the Louis-Philippe: there was another attempt to shoot him in 1836, two in 1840, and two more in 1846, including one shooting attempt by a gunman while he was greeting the crowd in the Tuileries gardens from the balcony of the palace. An attempted coup d'état took place in May 1839 in the center of the city, led by the radical republican Armand Barbés and the socialist Auguste Blanqui. On the afternoon of 12 May, about a thousand revolutionaries took up weapons and set out to seize the prefecture of police, the Châtelet, the Palais de Justice, and the Hôtel de Ville. They failed to capture the prefecture of police, and by the end of the afternoon, the regular army, municipal police and national guard had arrested most of the revolutionaries. The leaders were imprisoned until the end of the regime. Paris under Louis-Philippe also became a magnet for revolutionaries from other countries. Karl Marx moved to Paris in October 1843, and lived at 23 Rue Vaneau, where his daughter Jenny was born, and later at no. 38 on the same street. He became the editor of radical leftist German newspapers Deutsch–Französische Jahrbücher and Vorwärts!. The famous Russian anarchist and revolutionary Mikhail Bakunin was also an editor of the Jahrbücher. On 28 August 1844, Marx met for the first time his future collaborator Friedrich Engels at the Café de la Régence at the Palais-Royal, a café renowned for the international chess masters who regularly played there. At the request of Frederick William IV, King of Prussia, Marx was expelled from France in April 1845. He then moved to Brussels. The Revolution of 1848 A caricature of Louis-Philippe turning into a pear by Honoré Daumier (1831). Political caricatures were banned in 1835. The workers of Paris, especially those who had come from the provinces, were also increasingly dissatisfied with the government of Louis-Philippe. They complained of rising prices, low wages, and unemployment, and began to organize and go on strike. The workers on the new sewers were the first to strike, on 4 August 1832, followed by carpenters, then those working in wallpaper and garment factories. A period of economic growth calmed the unrest for a time but, in 1846-1847, a new economic crisis hit France in the form of a shortage of credit and money for investment caused by excessive speculation in the new railroads. Unemployment and the number of strikes increased, and confidence in the government's promises of prosperity fell. The dominant issue that brought many Parisians into conflict with the government was the right to vote, which was limited only to the wealthiest citizens. Only a third of the members of the National Guard, the main defense force of the regime in Paris, had the right to vote. The conservative government, with Louis-Philippe's support, refused to broaden the number of voters. In the elections for the Chamber of Deputies in July 1842, conservatives and monarchists retained their majority, but in Paris, ten of the twelve new members belonged to the opposition, two of them republicans. In the elections of 1846, more than 9000 votes went to opposition candidates out of 14,000 cast. Increasingly, the Parisians were more critical of Louis-Philippe's government than the rest of the country. The first opposition banquet in the park of Château-Rouge (9 July 1847) On 9 July 1847, the members of the opposition launched a new tactic to demand change in the electoral system: they held a large banquet in the park of the Château Rouge (now in the Quartier du Château Rouge) on the Rue de Clignancourt. The banquet was attended by 1200 persons, including 86 deputies. After this event, other opposition banquets were held in each of the arrondissements, and in cities around the country. One banquet was followed by a march of two to three thousand students under rain from the Madeleine and the Place de la Concorde. The government, under François Guizot, the Minister of the Interior, banned any further banquets and similar demonstrations and called on the National Guard to enforce the order. The National Guard, sympathetic to the opposition, refused to move, and instead chanted \\"Long live reform!\\" and \\"Down with Guizot!\\" The poet Lamartine proclaims the Second Republic at the Hôtel de Ville (25 February 1848) In the evening of 23 February 1848, a large crowd supporting the opposition gathered at the corner of the Rue Neuve des Capucines (since 1861, the Rue des Capucines) and Boulevard des Capucines in front of the now demolished Hôtel de Wagram, which housed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. At ten o'clock, at the sound of a gunshot, the battalion of soldiers guarding the building opened fire, killing 52 persons. At the news of the shooting, the leaders of the opposition called for an immediate uprising. On 24 February 1500 barricades went up all over Paris, many of them manned by soldiers of the National Guard. The commander of the regular army in Paris, Marshal Bugeaud, refused to give the order to open fire on the barricades. As a result, and on the same day, Louis-Philippe abdicated in favor of his nine- year-old grandson, Prince Philippe, Count of Paris. Simultaneously, a large crowd had invaded the Chamber of Deputies and called for a provisional government. A republican, Louis-Antoine Garnier-Pagès, was named the new mayor of Paris. On 25 February 1848, the poet Alphonse de Lamartine proclaimed the Second Republic and urged the crowd to keep the tricolor, rather than adopting the red flag as the national symbol. Another crowd invaded the Tuileries Palace, seized the royal throne, carried it to Place de la Bastille, and burned it at the foot of July Column. Louis-Philippe (in disguise as \\"Mr. Smith\\") and his family left the palace on foot through the garden of the Tuileries and reached the Place de la Concorde. There, they climbed into two carriages, and, with Louis-Philippe driving one carriage with three of his sons, fled Paris and took refuge in Dreux. On 2 March, the ex-king embarked at Le Havre for England, where he lived in exile with his family until his death on 26 August 1850.

Description Normally, data transfer between programs is accomplished using data structures suited for automated processing by computers, not people. Such interchange formats and protocols are typically rigidly structured, well-documented, easily parsed, and keep ambiguity to a minimum. Very often, these transmissions are not human-readable at all. Thus, the key element that distinguishes data scraping from regular parsing is that the output being scraped is intended for display to an end-user, rather than as input to another program, and is therefore usually neither documented nor structured for convenient parsing. Data scraping often involves ignoring binary data (usually images or multimedia data), display formatting, redundant labels, superfluous commentary, and other information which is either irrelevant or hinders automated processing. Data scraping is most often done either to interface to a legacy system, which has no other mechanism which is compatible with current hardware, or to interface to a third-party system which does not provide a more convenient API. In the second case, the operator of the third-party system will often see screen scraping as unwanted, due to reasons such as increased system load, the loss of advertisement revenue, or the loss of control of the information content. Data scraping is generally considered an ad hoc, inelegant technique, often used only as a \\"last resort\\" when no other mechanism for data interchange is available. Aside from the higher programming and processing overhead, output displays intended for human consumption often change structure frequently. Humans can cope with this easily, but a computer program may report nonsense, having been told to read data in a particular format or place and with no knowledge of how to check its results for validity. Technical variants  A screen fragment and a screen- scraping interface (blue box with red arrow) to customize data capture process. Although the use of physical \\"dumb terminal\\" IBM 3270s is slowly diminishing, as more and more mainframe applications acquire Web interfaces, some Web applications merely continue to use the technique of \\"screen scraping\\" to capture old screens and transfer the data to modern front- ends.\\"Back in the 1990s.. 2002 ... 2016 ... still, according to Chase Bank, a major issue. Screen scraping is normally associated with the programmatic collection of visual data from a source, instead of parsing data as in Web scraping. Originally, screen scraping referred to the practice of reading text data from a computer display terminal's screen. This was generally done by reading the terminal's memory through its auxiliary port, or by connecting the terminal output port of one computer system to an input port on another. The term screen scraping is also commonly used to refer to the bidirectional exchange of data. This could be the simple cases where the controlling program navigates through the user interface, or more complex scenarios where the controlling program is entering data into an interface meant to be used by a human. As a concrete example of a classic screen scraper, consider a hypothetical legacy system dating from the 1960s—the dawn of computerized data processing. Computer to user interfaces from that era were often simply text- based dumb terminals which were not much more than virtual teleprinters (such systems are still in use , for various reasons). The desire to interface such a system to more modern systems is common. A robust solution will often require things no longer available, such as source code, system documentation, APIs, or programmers with experience in a 50-year-old computer system. In such cases, the only feasible solution may be to write a screen scraper that \\"pretends\\" to be a user at a terminal. The screen scraper might connect to the legacy system via Telnet, emulate the keystrokes needed to navigate the old user interface, process the resulting display output, extract the desired data, and pass it on to the modern system. A sophisticated and resilient implementation of this kind, built on a platform providing the governance and control required by a major enterprise—e.g. change control, security, user management, data protection, operational audit, load balancing, and queue management, etc.—could be said to be an example of robotic process automation software, called RPA or RPAAI for self-guided RPA 2.0 based on artificial intelligence. In the 1980s, financial data providers such as Reuters, Telerate, and Quotron displayed data in 24×80 format intended for a human reader. Users of this data, particularly investment banks, wrote applications to capture and convert this character data as numeric data for inclusion into calculations for trading decisions without re-keying the data. The common term for this practice, especially in the United Kingdom, was page shredding, since the results could be imagined to have passed through a paper shredder. Internally Reuters used the term 'logicized' for this conversion process, running a sophisticated computer system on VAX/VMS called the Logicizer.Contributors Fret About Reuters' Plan To Switch From Monitor Network To IDN, FX Week, 02 Nov 1990 More modern screen scraping techniques include capturing the bitmap data from the screen and running it through an OCR engine, or for some specialised automated testing systems, matching the screen's bitmap data against expected results. This can be combined in the case of GUI applications, with querying the graphical controls by programmatically obtaining references to their underlying programming objects. A sequence of screens is automatically captured and converted into a database. Another modern adaptation to these techniques is to use, instead of a sequence of screens as input, a set of images or PDF files, so there are some overlaps with generic \\"document scraping\\" and report mining techniques. There are many tools that can be used for screen scraping. Web scraping Web pages are built using text-based mark-up languages (HTML and XHTML), and frequently contain a wealth of useful data in text form. However, most web pages are designed for human end-users and not for ease of automated use. Because of this, tool kits that scrape web content were created. A web scraper is an API or tool to extract data from a web site. Companies like Amazon AWS and Google provide web scraping tools, services, and public data available free of cost to end-users. Newer forms of web scraping involve listening to data feeds from web servers. For example, JSON is commonly used as a transport storage mechanism between the client and the webserver. Recently, companies have developed web scraping systems that rely on using techniques in DOM parsing, computer vision and natural language processing to simulate the human processing that occurs when viewing a webpage to automatically extract useful information. Large websites usually use defensive algorithms to protect their data from web scrapers and to limit the number of requests an IP or IP network may send. This has caused an ongoing battle between website developers and scraping developers. Report mining Report mining is the extraction of data from human-readable computer reports. Conventional data extraction requires a connection to a working source system, suitable connectivity standards or an API, and usually complex querying. By using the source system's standard reporting options, and directing the output to a spool file instead of to a printer, static reports can be generated suitable for offline analysis via report mining.Scott Steinacher, \\"Data Pump transforms host data\\", InfoWorld, 30 August 1999, p55 This approach can avoid intensive CPU usage during business hours, can minimise end-user licence costs for ERP customers, and can offer very rapid prototyping and development of custom reports. Whereas data scraping and web scraping involve interacting with dynamic output, report mining involves extracting data from files in a human-readable format, such as HTML, PDF, or text. These can be easily generated from almost any system by intercepting the data feed to a printer. This approach can provide a quick and simple route to obtaining data without needing to program an API to the source system.

Joel Whitney House is a historic house at 8 Pleasant Street in Phillips, Maine. Built in 1829 for a prominent early settler and businessman, it is one of the oldest houses in the small inland community, and probably the only two-story building of that age. It is now owned by the Phillips Historical Society, which houses museum displays in the rear sections. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003. Description and history The Whitney House is set at the southeast corner of Pleasant and Sawyer Streets, opposite Sawyer Street from the Union Church. The house is a rambling structure, with a 2-1/2 story side-gable main block, a long single-story ell extending to the rear, which joins to a square two-story carriage house with a cupola-topped hip roof. The main facade is five bays wide, with a central entrance flanked by sidelight windows and topped by a wooden fan set in an elaborate entablature in the Federal style. The rear ell was built in two stages, the first being integral to the house construction and the second added later. The carriage house has large sliding doors on two sides, with a large hay portal over the southern entrance. The interior of the main house has retained much of its original Federal period woodwork and hardware; the rear sections have been adapted for use as display, meeting, and library spaces by the historical society. The town of Phillips was incorporated in 1812. Captain Joel Whitney arrived with his family sometime between 1806 and 1815, bought of land, and soon became a man of local prominence. Lands he owned became part of Phillips village, he operated a saw mill and potash factory, and he served as an early postmaster. He donated the land for the adjacent Union Church, helped finance its construction, and donated the bell in its tower. This house was built for Whitney in 1829 by Jesse Ladd, a local housewright, some of whose other houses have survived. This is the only known two-story house of the period to survive in Phillips—all the others are 1-1/2 story Capes.

Variability RS Persei is classified as a semiregular variable star, with its brightness varying from magnitude 7.82 to 10.0 over 245 days, Detailed studies show that it also pulsates with a long secondary period of days. Properties RS Persei is a large cool star with a temperature of 3,500 K. This makes it luminous, although much of its radiation is emitted in the infrared. In 2005, RS Per was calculated to have a bolometric luminosity of and a radius around . More recently, 2014 calculations across all wavelengths gives the star a lower luminosity of based on an assumed distance, and a radius of based on the measured angular diameter and luminosity. Even more recent measurements based on its Gaia Data Release 2 parallax gives a luminosity below with a corresponding radius of . It is surrounded by dust that has condensed from material lost by the star. RS Persei has sometimes been considered to be a highly evolved low mass Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) star, but calculations of its current mass suggest that it is a low mass supergiant.

Her career spanned various roles in research, teaching, editing, and publishing. Dahlberg founded the journal International Classification (now Knowledge Organization) as well as both the scientific Society for Classification (de) and International Society for Knowledge Organization.  Professional career   Early years  The interest of Ingetraut Dahlberg in Documentation started when – at an age of 10 years – she received a camera from her father at Christmas. She started to document everything she regarded as important. Ingetraut Dahlberg lived most of her time in Frankfurt/Main. She studied Philosophy, History, Anglistics, Catholic Theology, and Biology at the universities of Frankfurt, Würzburg and Düsseldorf with one college year in the United States in between.Mary Manse College in Toledo, Ohio She married the physicist Dr. Reinhard Dahlberg, with whom she had her son Wolfgang.  Professional start  In 1959 she started a position at the Gmelin Institute headed by Prof. Dr. Erich Pietsch. Her job was to create bibliographical publications within the Documentation Center for Nuclear power. In 1961 she changed to abstracting work on economical topics in the “Rationalisierungs-Kuratorium der Deutschen Wirtschaft” (Board of Rationalisation and Innovation for the German Economy). In the years 1962-63 she took part in a one-year course to become a Scientific Documentalist. This course was organized by the “German Documentation Society” at the Gmelin Institute.  Deutsche Gesellschaft für Dokumentation (DGD) (German Documentation Society)  After the course she started a position with the “Deutsche Gesellschaft für Dokumentation” (DGD), Frankfurt (German Documentation Society). where she had to take care of the library and the documentation of documentation literature. In order to follow an invitation by Prof. Raymund Pepinsky, Florida Atlantic University, Boca Raton, to help in a documentation center for crystallographic data documentation, she could take leave for the year 1964-65 to work at his “Groth Institute for Crystalographic Data Documentation”. Later on, she could move to the university library (headed by Edward M. Heiliger); and could work in the first US-library to have a computer for this bibliographic work. Together with Jean Perreault she worked on problems of categories and relations in classification. After her return to Frankfurt, she was appointed director of the “DGD-Library and Documentation Center”. She also was asked to establish a Committee for Thesaurus Research and Classification to be chaired by Prof. Martin Scheele with Ingetraut Dahlberg acting as secretary. During this time she established also a descriptor system for information sciences. During this period the president of the DGD, Prof. Helmut Arntz sent her also to The Hague for cooperation with a FID-UDC-Revision Committee for UDC numbers 03/04 out of which she developed a classification system of document types and their special aspect-oriented concepts covering more than 1,000 concepts (1968). In the years 1967-1974 she also collaborated in the work of the German Standardization Institute on terminology, concerning DIN 2330 “Concepts and Terms, General Principles”DIN 2330: Begriffe und Benennungen; Allgemeine Grundsätze (“Concepts and Terms, General Principles”) and DIN 2331 “Concept Systems and their Presentation”DIN 2331: Begriffssysteme und ihre Darstellung (“Concept systems and their representation”) Here she met Prof. Eugen Wüster, who had some influence on her further work. In 1970, she was also delegated to cooperate in a Committee for Classification and Indexing in the context of the UNISIST-ProgramUNISIST = UNESCO United Nations International Scientific Information System of UNESCO, headed by Douglas John Foskett.  Taking a doctor's degree  In 1971, she left the DGD in order to take up a postgraduate study in Philosophy with Prof. Alwin Diemer in Düsseldorf on further subjects such as General Linguistics and History of science (1971-1973). Her doctoral advisor suggested the scope and title: A Universal Classification System of Knowledge: its ontological, science-theoretical and information-theoretical foundations (English translation). Dahlberg obtained her degree in 1973; the thesis was published in 1974 by Verlag Dokumentation K. Saur as: Foundations for a universal organization of knowledge (Grundlagen universaler Wissensordnung).  Free lance work  During the work for her doctoral thesis she continued as a free lance for projects additional to her work for her M.D. (doctor degree). * 1971-1972 she was appointed to the consulting group Database-system for the Bundesrepublik Deutschland (Federal Republic of Germany) of the German Federal Ministry of the Interior. She edited two of its resulting three volumes. * 1972-1973 Collection of terms denoting subject fields, a project financed by the DGD. * 1972-74 Collaboration with the FID/CR Group “Subject-Field Reference Code”FID=Fédération Internationale de Documentation, CR=Classification Research in order to establish a Broad System of Ordering as proposed by the UNISIST Program). * 1975-1976 appointed by the Deutscher HochschulverbandAssociation of professors to revise their classification system of university courses. * 1976-1979 elaboration of the DFG-Project “Logstruktur”.The project name Logstruktur stands for logical structure, this is to say in respect of content relationships not unfolding from the name of a field of knowledge, but where background knowledge is required to see the interrelations. Parallel to this project the project „Semstruktur\\" was established, under the direction of Gerhard Wahrig. This dealt with the semantic structure, hence with the structure unfolding from the name of a field of knowledge. In the middle of the seventies the collection of subject fields had grown to embrace 12,500 terms. The project was meant to collect and explore their definitions. This led to track numerous synonyms and resulted in a manageable reduction of the number of subject fields. * 1978-1979 “Pilot Study DB-Thesaurus”. As an assignment of the Deutsche Nationalbibliothek (German National Library) she had to examine their subject headings regarding their thesaurus pertinence and propose a relative recommendation. * 1979-1992 Collaboration in the committee on Conceptual and Terminological Analysis in the Social Sciences (COCTA), sponsored by UNESCO and founded by Prof. Fred W. Riggs. She organized conferences in Bielefeld and Hattersheim and collaborated in the organization of its conference in Budapest.  Founding the Journal “International Classification”  In 1974, she founded the Journal International Classification (IC).The journal was published by Verlag Dokumentation K.G. Saur until 1980, afterwards by INDEKS-Verlag and since 1997 by Ergon-Verlag Her coeditors were Alwin Diemer, Eugen Wüster, Jean Perreault and A. Neelameghan. Its first issue contained Dahlberg's article “Zur Theorie des Begriffs” (On concept theory), in which she published her new concept theory for the first time. She referred to this article quite often in later publications.Beside others in: Her concept was considerably influenced by Gottlob Frege. Since its very beginning the journal contained – next to scientific articles – also a section on news, book reviews, and a continuing bibliography of current classification literature. In 1992, the journal changed its name into Knowledge Organization (see chapter Founding of INDEKS Company). It has been published under this name up to today.  Appearance of the Information Coding Classification  In 1977, the universal classification system of subject fields was ready and named Information Coding Classification (ICC). It is based on nine Levels of being and structured by nine facets. Its first presentation took place in Bangalore, India, during a seminar at S. R. Ranganathan’s Documentation Research and Training Centre (the DRTC). It was a full success. The seminar proceedings were published under the title “Ontical Structures and Universal Classification”. Before and after this seminar week, Ms. Dahlberg lectured at several universities in India.New- Delhi, Trivandrum, Madras, Varanasi (Prof. Kaula) and Tokyo, Japan  Founding of INDEKS Company  In 1979, Ingetraut Dahlberg and her son Wolfgang set up a firm under the name of INDEKS purporting to establish indexes and classification systems. In 1980, she continued the firm without her son called from then on INDEKS Verlag.  Founding “Gesellschaft für Klassifikation (GfKl) Data Science Society”  For a meeting on 12 February 1977, Dahlberg invited representatives from libraries and documentation centres, commodity cataloguers, physics, chemistry and mathematics to come to Frankfurt in order to found the “Gesellschaft für Klassifikation e.V. Data Science Society” (GfKl) . Already on June 4, 1977 she organized the first annual conference in Münster/Westfalen. She was elected chairperson of the society and acted also as its secretary until 1989. She organized the annual conferences until 1986 and published the proceedings volumes.  The FID Committee for Classification Research  Dahlberg was also chair of this Committee 1981 – 1987. During this time she organized its conferences in Canada, Germany and India. Twice she took the opportunity as head of GfKl and FID/CR to combine their conferences in 1979 (Bad Königstein) and 1982 (Augsburg).  International Classification and Indexing Bibliography (ICIB)  With a financial contribution from the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Germany) she managed in 1980-1982 the collection, printing and indexing of a bibliography of internationally available literature on Classification and Indexing. Three of the five planned volumes could be published in the years 1982–1985. They covered the publications of the years 1952-1982 and contained more than 11,000 titles, all of them classed according to ICC and also according to the special Classification System of Classification, established for bibliographical data in the journal International Classification. Vol.1 contains a list of all universal and special classification systems and thesauri. Also the upper three hierarchical levels of ICC were published there.  Founding “International Society for Knowledge Organization (ISKO)  Owing to an increasing preponderance of mathematic-oriented members, the Gesellschaft für Klassifikation split in 1989 on the initiative of its concept-oriented members, who founded the “International Society for Knowledge Organization e.V.” (ISKO). Ingetraut Dahlberg was elected president, Robert Fugmannn vice-presidentFugmann had been vice-president of the Gesellschaft für Klassifikation beforehand. ISKO obtained also the care of the journal “International Classification”, founded by Dahlberg. The new term “Knowledge Organization” instead of classification soon became common usage and also the journal was renamed (1992) accordingly. Next to managing ISKO's head-organization Dahlberg also assisted in the creation of ISKO's national chapters.Bulgaria, Slovakia, Hungary, Italy, Spain, Russia, Poland, France, India, China She took an active part in the organization of international conferences evry other year and also in the German conferences in the intermediate years. She helped editing and published respective proceedings volumes (e.g.).  Retracting from official positions  At the age of 70 and because of health problems, Ingetraut Dahlberg retired from her official positions in 1997. In 1998 she left Frankfurt for Bad König, a spa town in the eastern Odenwald mountain area, 75 km south of Frankfurt. She transferred her INDEKS publishing house to the Ergon Verlag in Würzburg. Charles Gilreath from Texas A&M; University became the new editor- in-chief for Knowledge Organization and Hanne Albrechtsen from Denmark became the new ISKO president for the rest of Dahlberg's elected time. Her special library of classification, terminology and information science literature went to the Maastricht McLuhan Institute for Digital Culture and Knowledge Organization, directed by Prof. Dr. Kim H. Veltman. Nevertheless, she remained engaged with her main occupational concern via by contacts, publications, and lectures.  Influence  Ingetraut Dahlberg at a talk 25 October 2015 at Ernst Schröder Center for Conceptual Knowledge Processing in Darmstadt, Germany  More recent Work  After an encounter with Walter Koch, Graz, during a conference in Karlsruhe in 2010. Ms. Dahlberg started to digitize some 3,500 of the 6,500 concepts of knowledge fields with their definitions in a table sheet file and also many concepts of the so-called “general concepts” from the zero-level of ICC (still unfinished). These work could serve as starting base for a linkage e.g. with WordNet, as it has been demonstrated in a paper by Ernesto DeLuca, Potsdam at the international ISKO Congress in Kraków, in May 2014. Her recent book, published 2014, on “Knowledge Organization, Development, Task, Application, Future” (in German) also details some of the activities mentioned. It addresses particularly computer scientists, in order to convey to them a humanistic view on the content related treatment of their data, but turns also to readers wishing to access the topic principally. It also covers the theoretical basis of ICC and shows its many-fold potential for applications. She emphasizes her conception – next to subject-related aspects – of an innovating approach to science-policy issues. She strongly recommends Knowledge Organization to be anchored in universities as a discipline of its own under “Science of Science”. Already in 1974 she had provided in her ICC a position for Knowledge Organization under the subject group “81” (Science of Science). She considers indeed this field to be explored within an institute or an academy since there is such a huge amount of work to be accomplished under the fruitful auspices of the whole array of insights gained so far.  Activities  Ingetraut Dahlberg was active in the area of classification, thesauri, terminology and knowledge organization. On these topics she has written far more than 300 publications. Apart from her own scientific work, she considerably contributed to furthering these topics also by the founding the journal “International Classification” in 1974 under its later name Knowledge Organization. She also directed a number of groups and institutions concerned with these scientific branches by organizing conferences and editing and publishing the proceedings volumes of these conferences. She also collaborated in the elaboration of standards (DIN 2330 and 2331) as well as DIN 32705, later on also for ISO/TC37 (“Terminology and other language and content resources”) as well as ISO/TC 46 “Information and Documentation”). For 23 years she was editor-in-chief of her journal and founded the “Gesellschaft für Klassifikation e.V.” (1977) and the “International Society for Knowledge Organization e.V.” (1989). She also organized altogether 20 conferences for these two organizations and for FID/CR and COCTA.  Teaching Appointments  Starting 1976 she received teaching appointments at the University of Mainz (1976-1978) (Gerhard Wahrig). The project “Logstruktur” was connected with this appointment. It meant to explore the structure of definitions of the collected terms of ca. 6,500 knowledge fields and to systematize them. With this, the preliminary work was ready for an encyclopedia of knowledge fields. Further teaching appointments were at the University of Saarbrücken (1984-1985), Hochschule Hannover (1985-87) and Darmstadt University of Applied Sciences (1988-1989). In addition, Dahlberg was often requested to lecture at many universities and gave seminars in India and Brazil.  Publications  Ms. Dahlberg wrote far more than 300 publications among which also encyclopedic entries on classification and knowledge organization.  Mission  Ingetraut Dahlberg deplores the dispersion of knowledge in our times and finds the reason for this development in the diversity of thesauri and also of subject-oriented ontologies. As a practical-sensed philosopher, she would promote a sort of order reaching beyond a single subject-orientation (she uses the concept “universal order of knowledge” as a foundation for an interdisciplinary approach. She presents this vista of view energetically and defends it against other aspects of knowledge organization Above all, she is interested in seeing her Information Coding Classification system (ICC) being further developed and completed.  Awards  * She received the 2nd prize of the “International Association of Documentalists and Information Officers” (A.I.D.) at the A.I.D. International Symposium 1965. The prize was divided between her and Mr. S. D. Boon, Eindhoven. * Ranganathan Award. given at the FID Conference 1996 in Innsbruck * Eugen Wüster Sonderpreis of the “International Information Center for Terminology″ (Infoterm) 2006 in Vienna.

Renner, a professor of German who founded the Latin language program at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, specialized in the history of the Roman Catholic Church in Alaska. He authored several volumes and books on Alaska's Catholic history, including the extensive \\"Alaskana Catholica,\\" which was published in 2005. Biography Early life and education Renner was born on April 25, 1926, in Bismarck, North Dakota. Although called \\"Louis\\", he was baptized \\"Aloysius\\", a Latin form of that name. He was raised on a family homestead located between Fallon and Flasher, North Dakota, just outside Bismarck. He was the second eldest of the family's seven children. His parents, John J. Renner and Rose Gustin, were the descendants of German and Russian emigrants to the United States. The family spoke German at home, so Renner did not learn English until he entered elementary school when he was seven-years old. Since there were no Catholic schools in Flasher, North Dakota, Renner and his siblings enrolled at a boarding school in Fallon, North Dakota, run by the Benedictine Sisters. The family moved from North Dakota to Tacoma, Washington, in 1937 during the Great Depression. His father, who disliked farming, welcomed the chance to sell the family's farm, which had been hit hard by droughts. He graduated from Bellarmine Preparatory School in Tacoma in 1944. He joined the Society of Jesus, commonly called the Jesuits, in March, 1944, shortly before his 18th birthday, and entered the Jesuit Novitiate in Sheridan, Oregon after high school. Renner received a master's degree in philosophy from Gonzaga University in 1951. He also completed both a licentiate degree and a master of sacred theology degree from Santa Clara University in California by 1958. He also studied in France, Italy and Germany as part of his training to become a Jesuit. For example, Renner completed an intensive, six-week French language course of study at the Sorbonne in Paris as preparation for his final year of Jesuit training in Paray-le-Monial, France. Renner enrolled in an intensive German language course at the University of Vienna in August, 1961. He graduated magna cum laude from the University of Munich with a doctorate of philosophy in 1965. Alaska Renner was ordained a Jesuit on June 15, 1957, in Spokane, Washington. He was sent to Fairbanks, Alaska, in 1958, where he spent more than forty years. Renner taught and worked in both Fairbanks and villages within the Alaska Interior, including Ruby, Tanana and Healy. Renner never got a driver's license during his time in Alaska. He often walked to his office on Peger Road in Fairbanks, completing the 7.5 round trip commute on foot. He taught at Monroe High School, the only Catholic high school in the Diocese of Fairbanks. Renner was a language professor at the University of Alaska Fairbanks from 1965 to 1980. He taught German and founded the UofA Fairbank's Latin program. Louis Renner served as the editor of the Alaska Shepherd, the official newsletter of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Fairbanks, for 21 years. As a historian, Father Renner conducted extensive research on the history of the Catholic Church in Alaska. He published several volumes of work on the subject, including \\"Alaskana Catholica,\\" released in 2005. He wrote in the preface of \\"Alaskana Catholica,\\": \\"One of the main intents of this volume is to keep alive for posterity the memory of many major Catholic Alaska figures — clerical and lay, Native and non-Native, living and deceased — by the recording of their lives and deeds.\\" In 2009, Renner published his autobiography, \\"A Kindly Providence: An Alaskan Missionary's Story 1926-2007.\\" Father Louis Renner died on March 24, 2015, at the Gonzaga University Jesuit Infirmary in Spokane, Washington, at the age of 88.

There was an interesting incident allegedly noted during a 1908 trip. A car with Alfonso XIII travelling North to Biarritz and a car with Don Jaime travelling South to Behovia met at a closed railway crossing near Urugne in France. While Don Jaime’s entourage, including Rafael de Olazábal and Julio de Urquijo, rose to pay their respect to member of the royal family, Don Jaime kept sitting and stared at Alfonso XIII, who did not know the Carlist prince.

By some sources Urquijo is referred to as the speaker of the Basque-Carlist minority, Robles Munoz, La Santa Sede y II República, Madrid 2014, , 9788415965206, p. 536. Other scholar claims it was rather Joaquín Beunza heading the group as a more acceptable candidate holding it together, Martin Blinkhorn, Carlism and Crisis in Spain 1931-1939, Cambridge 1975, , pp. 58, 319 As political tension mounted he is reported as \\"not uninterested in the idea of a general Catholic rising\\", though insurrectional concept has not even passed to the planning phase;the government remained vigilant and staged spurious military \\"exercises\\" in the area, Blinkhorn 1975, p. 63 Urquijo was also noted for intransigent defense of Catholic Church.Idoia Estornés Zubizarreta, Julio Urquijo Ybarra entry It is not clear whether legal action against Urquijo, considered by the Cortes,El Imparcial 19.05.32, available here had anything to do with conspiracy or whether it was rather related to his engagement in the conflict between Republican authorities and the primate Segura.the result of his mediation was release from detention of the vicar general of Vitoria, Justo Echegueren, Robles Muñoz 1997, p. 464 Donostia, 1939 The question of autonomy status for the Vasco-Navarrese area fuelled the row between nationalists and Carlists and divided the Carlists themselves. Urquijo is listed neither among its key opponentslike Pradera, Blinkhorn 1975, pp. 83-4 or Olazabal, Santiago de Pablo, El carlismo guipuzcoano y el Estatuto Vasco, [in:] Bilduma Rentería 2 (1988), p. 195 nor among its key proponents;like Oriol and Oreja, Blinkhorn 1975, pp. 83-4 or Beunza, Santiago de Pablo 1988, p. 195 even detailed studies dedicated to Carlist-Basque negotiations on the autonomy do not mention Urquijo as engaged, either during the initial phase when SEV drafted its autonomy plan or during the last-minute attempt to rescue the project by Elorza and Arregui.compare Santiago de Pablo 1988 Urquijo represented the Carlists on the key assembly, gathering deputies and local Vasco-Navarrese mayors, and left before the end of \\"disagreeable session\\"; soon afterwards the Catholic-fuerista minority disintegrated altogether.Blinkhorn 1975, p. 84 In the 1933 electoral campaign renewing the Carlists-Basque alliance was already unthinkable and Urquijo was not needed as a candidate. None of the sources consulted provides any information on Urquijo's political activities during final years of the Republic or whether he was anyhow involved in preparations to the 1936 coup. At the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War he was in San Sebastián, where the rebels failed; though not detained, fearing for his life Urquijo fled.Idoia Estornés Zubizarreta, Julio Urquijo Ybarra entry; it is not clear whether he left San Sebastian, left Gipuzkoa or left Spain altogether He re-emerged in Gipuzkoa when the province was already captured by the Nationalists, but refrained from political activity.one author suggests vaguely that Urquijo might have been somehow restricted in Francoist Spain: \\"Incluso escritores de ideologia carlista (Azkue, Urquijo etc) ven frenadas y frustradas sus expectativas de comuncación con los potenciales lectores\\", see Sánchez Erauskin 1994, p. 80 Though obituaries claimed that he \\"militió siempre en las filas del Tradicionalismo español\\"ABC 29.10.50, available here no study confirms (or denies) that he remained a Carlist also in the 1940s. Linguist: the beginner Azkue Among Urquijo's Deusto teachers Román Biel and Tomás Escriche Mieg were those who raised his interest in linguistics;Arana Martija 1993, p. 3 it was further reinforced by comparative worksHurch, Kerejeta 1997, p. 11 of Julio Cejadorwho taught philosophy, Arana Martija 1993, p. 4; see also Julio de Urquijo e Ibarra, Julio Cejador, [in:] RIEV 18 (1927), pp. 179-180, available here and by Resurreción María Azkue, who served as the family chaplainLizundia Askondo 2007, p. 107 and in 1888 assumed the chair of Basque language in Instituto de Bilbao.Luis Villasante Cortabitarte, Resurrección María Azkue Aberasturi entry [in:] Auñamendi Eusko Entziklopedia online, available here Initially Urquijo's juvenile interestit was in 1887 he started correspondence with Louis Lucien Bonaparte, asking him to sell a book, Hurch, Kerejeta 1997, p. 11  apart from learning foreign languagesRobles Muñoz 1997, p. 43  tended to focus not on any particular language but on comparative linguistics with issues like linguistic parentage, inter-linguistic influences or general \\"Sachwortgeschichte\\".Hurch, Kerejeta 1997, p. 2 It soon evolved into studies on artificial languages; in 1889 he published his first work, a booklet in volapük,titled Konils Volapükik pelovepolöl(s) fa Volapükels difik e Pekonletöl(s), Lizundia Askondo 2007, p. 107 and started correspondence with volapük activists, entering also the St. Petersburg volapük Academy.Arana Martija 1993, p. 18 Living in aristocratic and cosmopolitan Saint-Jean-de-Luz Urquijo got his xenophile attitude reinforced,Arana Martija 1993, p. 6 though he became disappointed with chaotic and contrived character of volapük, which he finally abandoned in 1905.in November 1905 Urquijo published in La Gaceta del Norte two pieces: El Esperanto es una utopía and Ni volapük, ni esperanto. Desengaño de un volpükista bilbaíno, Lizundia Askondo 2007, p. 107 Urquijo's disillusionment with artificial languages might have pushed him towards studying Basque,Lizundia Askondo 2007, p. 107 another language with apparently great potential for literary emergence but firmly based in locally spoken dialects. Around 1905 he started correspondence with foreign vascologists like Julien VinsonJulio de Urquijo e Ibarra, Julien Vinson (1843-1926), [in:] RIEV 18 (1927), pp. 217-224, available here and Hugo Schuchardt,Lizundia Askondo 2007, p. 107-8 twice meeting the latter in his Graz study.in 1907 and 1909, Hurch, Kerejeta 1997, p. 17. The second visit was probably when Urquijo was returning from the Varese funeral of Carlos VII Initially their relation was far from partnership, Urquijo providing materials and information requested and accepting scholarly dictatorship of the Austrian.Monreal Zia 2001, p. 15 Urquijo's own interest in Basque was very much formatted along Schuchardt's lines, with focus on historical analysis, cross-linguistic influences, hybrids, \\"Sprachmischung\\" and comparatistics at the expense of neo- grammar.Michelena 1971, p. 64, Hurch, Kerejeta 1997, pp. 6-8 Gradually he was becoming more and more competent intellectual partner of both SchuchardtHurch, Kerejeta 1997, p. 20 and Azkue,Lizundia Askondo 2007, p. 108 the number of his other correspondents also growing rapidly.his archive contained correspondence with de Dodgson (235 letters), Lacombe (208), J.

Urquijo has always underlined that he was neither a philologue nor a linguist He started to collect historical Basque prints; during electoral campaigns he allegedly instructed his agents to look for books rather than for votes, launching a widely scaled search and patrolling caserios, churches and convents.Idoia Estornés Zubizarreta, Julio Urquijo Ybarra entry Developing relationship with established booksellers across EuropeIdoia Estornés Zubizarreta, Julio Urquijo Ybarra entry he started to build a library which soon assumed a monumental size.he was prepared to purchase 2,000 items if that was necessary to get the only one he wanted, Idoia Estornés Zubizarreta, Julio Urquijo Ybarra entry; other version claims that the 2,000 figure refers to pesetas, Arana Martija 1993, p. 14 In the mid-1930s his collection grew to some 11,000 items,it contained 7,549 books, 1,427 manuscripts, 273 magazines and 1267 other documents, 10,822 items in total, Arana Martija 1993, p. 14, Robles Muñoz 1997, p. 44 including a number of rarities,his library contained 6 first edits of Gero and 200 books published 1548-1799, see hiru service available here in 1936 saved from the war mayhem by the autonomous Basque government.which sent a detachment of Miqueletes to prevent ransacking of his abandoned estate, Idoia Estornés Zubizarreta, Julio Urquijo Ybarra entry Gradually his bibliophilia, possibly bordering bibliomania, converted to bibliography, which became one of his favorite disciplines.Michelena 1971, p. 48 Vascólogo: organizer Biscay Diputacion site, Bilbao Urquijo was convinced that to be sustainable, vascólogia must assume a formal shapehis secretly nurtured dream was to create a Basque University, Michelena 1971, p. 57 and strove to build a network of research institutions.Michelena 1971, p. 51 In 1901 he co-founded Eskualzaleen Biltzarra, association aiming at promotion of Basque culture.in Hondarribia, Idoia Estornés Zubizarreta, Julio Urquijo Ybarra entry At that time he was already harboring an idea of \\"Academia de la Lengua Vascongada\\" and influenced his older brother accordingly;Lizundia Askondo 2007, p. 105 the result was a 1906 initiative fathered by Adolfo Urquijo as head of the Biscay Diputacion,Lizundia Askondo 2007, p. 104 though it eventually came to nothing.in name of the Biscay provincial government Adolfo Urquijo asked the governments of Gipuzkoa, Navarre and Álava for support; the first two agreed, but Alava refused, Arana Martija 1993, p. 16 In 1907 Urquijo used his own funds to found Revista Internacional de los Estudios Vascos.Idoia Estornés Zubizarreta, Julio Urquijo Ybarra entry; he has been already for some time intending to set up a specialist review, Hurch, Kerejeta 1997, p. 11 Formally he delegated editorial dutiesthe secretary and key editor was Georges Lacombe, but he was soon replaced by Fausto Arocena, who gradually started to steer the review, Monreal Zia 2001, p. 16 standing as owner and manager,self-dubbed \\"director, administrador, corrector de pruebas y hasta de conceptos\\", Monreal Zia 2001, p. 17 though Urquijo remained its moving spirit,Monreal Zia 2001, p. 15 attracting a number of Spanishlike Carmelo de Echegaray, Arturo Campión, Domingo de Aguirre and Serapio Múgica, Monreal Zia 2001, pp. 16-17 and foreign correspondents.Arana Martija 1993, p. 10, Monreal Zia 2001, p. 19 Based in Paris, it was issued also in San Sebastián,Monreal Zia 2001, p. 17 as Urquijo realized that it had to be rooted in the Vascongadas.Monreal Zia 2001, p. 16 Its focus was initially on Basque linguistics and philology,to a lesser degree also history, Monreal Zia 2001, p. 18 later other areas gaining prominence.like theatre, geography, anthropology, sociology, ethnology, ethography, prehistory, law, music, and religion, Monreal Zia 2001, p. 18 Its key role was introducing scientific standards,Michelena 1971, p. 51 bringing foreign vascology to Spain,Monreal Zia 2001, p. 19 re-publishing historical Basque texts and broadening research to new fields.e.g. philology got expanded into phonetics, etymology, morfology, onomastics, toponimia and dialectology There were 27 volumes published until 1936all of them accessible here and RIEV soon outpaced other, usually ephemeral periodicals as the key platform of vascólogist scientific exchange. In 1908 Urquijo assumed presidency of Eskualzaleen Biltzarra and galvanized the association.Idoia Estornés Zubizarreta, Julio Urquijo Ybarra entry When in 1911 the Gipuzkoan diputación decided to launch its own San Sebastián review promoting the Basque culture, Urquijo was among co-founders of Euskalerriaren Alde; he remained in its executive councilIdoia Estornés Zubizarreta, Julio Urquijo Ybarra entry, also hiru service available here and contributed until the periodical closed in 1931. Also in 1911 he was among initiators of the Bayonne-based Cercle d'Etudes Euskariennes and became its president, a short-lived initiative which endured until 1913.Arana Martija 1993, p. 16-17 Sociedad de Estudios Vascos being founded, Oñati 1918 In 1918 Urquijo took part in Congress of Basque Studies in Oñati, which resulted in setting up Sociedad de Estudios Vascos,Idoia Estornés Zubizarreta, Julio Urquijo Ybarra entry later known as Eusko Ikaskuntza.Lizundia Askondo 2007, p. 105 Some scholars claim that SEV reproduced the format of Basque studies shaped by RIEV;Monreal Zia 2001, p. 24 some maintain that SEV was simply born out of the RIEV.Michelena 1971, p. 59 Urquijo became its vice-presidentand performed this role until 1930, Arana Martija 1993, p. 17, Lizundia Askondo 2007, p. 105 and member of Languagebetween 1923 and 33, Idoia Estornés Zubizarreta, Julio Urquijo Ybarra entry and Literaturefrom 1933 onwards, Idoia Estornés Zubizarreta, Julio Urquijo Ybarra entry sections. The organizationenjoying official patronage of 4 Vasco-Navarrese provinces grew into key Basque cultural institution, eclipsing other vascólogist groupings.like Eskualzaleen Biltzarra (created 1902) or Sociedad del Eusko-Folklore (created 1921) In 1919 SEV gave birth to Euskaltzaindia,Lizundia Askondo 2007, p. 105 Royal Academy of the Basque language;Lizundia Askondo 2007, p. 105-6 Urquijo became one of its 4 academics,except Urquijo also Azkue, Campión, and Eleizalde, Lizundia Askondo 2007, p. 109 Head of Research and Chief Librarian.Lizundia Askondo 2007, p. 105 In 1922 he ceded RIEV ownership to SEVthe review became \\"órgano de publicidad científica de la Sociedad de Estudios Vascos\\", Monreal Zia 2001, p. 25 and remained its manager.Idoia Estornés Zubizarreta, Julio Urquijo Ybarra entry, Monreal Zia 2001, p. 25 In late 1937 Urquijo entered newly established Nationalist RAE as its secretary, assuming \\"the second most important academic position\\" in the Francoist zone;Anton Ugarte, The relaunching of Euskaltzaindia (1937-1941): from the Ministry of National Education’s omission to the Board of Culture of Bizkaia’s imposition, [in:] Bildebarrieta 26 (2016), p. 169. It is not clear when Urquijo ceased as the secretary of RAE; contemporary scholar notes that when in 1940 its headquarters moved back to Madrid, he found himself \\"pushed back to the periphery\\", Ugarte 2016, p. 175 during the first sitting of 1938 he swore loyalty to \\"Caudillo, Salvador de nuestro pueblo\\".Ugarte 2016, p. 169 Together with Azkue he worked to re-launch Euskaltzaindia.aided grossly by the then Carlist minister of justice, Esteban Bilbao, Ugarte 2016, p. 176 In 1941 the body was instituted again, though under new conditions;no foreign members were allowed, exiled members were not to be re-admitted, and new members were to be recruited from those who demonstrated sufficient support for the regime, Ugarte 2016, p. 179; contemporary student speculates that Urquijo did not accept these limitations wholeheartedly, Ugarte 2016, p. 181 at verge of nervous breakdownin May 1941 he admitted to in May 1941 admitted to „mis nervios bastante destemplados”, Ugarte 2016, p. 181 Urquijo remained pessimistic as to the purpose and prospects of the institution.Ugarte 2016, p. 181. He was also personally shattered by loss of 6 family members, including his younger brother, executed by the Republicans, Monreal Zia 2001, p. 26 In 1943 Urquijo was among co- founders of Real Sociedad Bascongada de Amigos del País,Idoia Estornés Zubizarreta, Julio Urquijo Ybarra entry, Lizundia Askondo 2007, p. 105; the name seems to reflect Urquijo's preferences; his key work was dedicated to Caballeritos de Azcoitia, an 18th century group which gave birth to the original Real Sociedad Bascongada de Amigos del País becoming its chairman.Lizundia Askondo 2007, p. 105 The organization started issuing its review, Eusko Jakintza,Monreal Zia 2001, p. 26 in 1945 transformed into the Boletín of RSBAP; Urquijo became its manager.Lizundia Askondo 2007, p. 109 Vascólogo: own contribution Urquijo (centre) among prominent Basque writers, around 1910 Though one scholar suggested that Urquijo's own production is divided into 4 phases distinguished mostly by institutional milestones,1) until RIEV was founded in 1907; 2) from 1907 to founding SEV in 1918; 3) from 1918 to the Civil War; 4) after 1940, Lizundia Askondo 2007, p. 106 other works do not mention any specific change or evolution of his cultural work, except that he wrote only single pieces prior to 1907Lizundia Askondo 2007, p. 107 and after 1940.Lizundia Askondo 2007, pp. 109-110 His written contribution is extensive though not massive and covers some 300 titles,for most complete bibliography, see Jon Bilbao, Bibliografía de don Julio de Urquijo, [in:] Homenaje a D. Julio de Urquijo, Donostia 1949, pp. 67-87, and Enciclopedia General del País Vasco, part C, Eusko Bibliographia, Vol. VIII, pp. 106-110 including books, articles, reviews, booklets and newspaper items,Lizundia Askondo 2007, p. 110 with most prominent works written between 1922 and 1929.La Crónica de Ibargüen Cachopín y el Canto de Lelo (1922), La Cruz de Sangre. El Cura Santa Cruz. Pequeña rectificación histórica (1928), Los Amigos del País, según cartas y otros documentos inéditos del siglo XVIII (1929), De algunos problemas de interés general que suscita el euskera (1929), and the most prominent one, Un juicio sujeto a revisión. Menéndez Pelayo y los Caballeritos de Azcoitia (1925), see hiru service available here The key feature of Urquijo's work is its great multifariousness, as his contribution falls into a number of areas: general linguistics, comparative linguistics, paremiology, onomastics, ancient songs and stories, origin of the Basque language, folklore, archaeology, heraldry, etymology, music, literature including poetry, invented universal languages and commercial history of Bilbao, not to count single pieces representing odd and isolated subjects.like Bolchevismo y vascólogía or El terrible ruso Jakovlev, Lizundia Askondo 2007, p. 110 Another fundamental characteristic is scholarly discipline,Hurch, Kerejeta 1997, p. 10 especially as opposed to sometimes extravagant and highly hypothetical theories pursued by other vascophiles of the early 20th century.Idoia Estornés Zubizarreta, Julio Urquijo Ybarra entry, Arana Martija 1993, p. 10 Though initially Urquijo displayed interest in some very specific topics like evolution of the Sare dialect,Hurch, Kerejeta 1997, p. 19 over time he specialized in two areas. The first one was bibliography,Monreal Zia 2001, p. 20 which suited his systematic nature and together with periodical accounts supplied to RIEV made him emerge as \\"mayor bibliografo vasco\\".hiru service available here Another one was paremiology, always generating his particular interest and resulting in a number of publications.like Los refranes vascos de Sauguis traducidos y anotados (1909), Los refranes y sentencias de 1596. Estudio comparativo (1911) and Los Refranes de Garibay (1919) Some works add also dialects and their changes over time as another of his preferred subjects.hiru service available here Urquijo (2nd row, 2nd from R) in Euskaltzaindia, 1927 In terms of own writings, Urquijo's contribution was incomparable to production of Azkue, especially that his knowledge and fluency in Basque was far inferior.Michelena 1971, p. 53; none of the works consulted specifies what Urquijo’s mothertongue was Contemporary scholars summarise his work as discreet and modest but effective,Lizundia Askondo 2007, p. 108 possibly constrained by his excess self-criticism;Lizundia Askondo 2007, p. 108-9 they rush to underline that in general, apart from his scholarly production and organizational achievements, Urquijo's contribution consisted to a huge extent of discussion and friendly critique.\\"If we were to rush to conclude that he contributed little or nothing to Basque linguistics and, at the same time, to linguistic studies among us, we would, however, be allowing ourselves to be deceived by appearances. He contributed a lot, precisely because, with a certain appreciation of the situation, he was content to assume the role of mediator, essential at that moment.\\", Mitxelena referred by Lizundia Askondo 2007, p. 109 Some vascólogos even consider his polemical effort as one of key threads of his entire activity,Michelena 1971, p. 62-3 pointing that he did not refrain from and indeed willingly engaged in always amicable disputes with Eleizalde,compare Julio de Urquijo e Ibarra, Luis de Eleizalde, [in:] RIEV 14 (1923), pp. 695-697, available here Baroja and many others.Monreal Zia 2001, p. 15 Vascólogo: controversies Sabino Arana As a vascólogo Urquijo was involved in a number of fundamental debates related to the Basque realm. He followed Azkue when confronting the \\"aranistas\\".also Schuchardt was greeted by the Aranistas with irritation, Hurch, Kerejeta 1997, p. 18 He charged them with pursuing an amateurish and highly speculative approach, resulting in advancing theories which suited their allegedly idealized, Arcadian and almost mythical vision of Basque community; this stance had to be repelled by purely scientific approach. Urquijo's decisiveness in dismantling what he considered myths has even earned him the opinion of an iconoclast.Hurch, Kerejeta 1997, p. 13; Urquijo accepted this name with some shyness and some pride. He was once urgently requested by a friend to pop in; when there already, the friend explained that a house nearby was being demolished and he was sure Urquijo would enjoy watching it, Michelena 1971, p. 63. An anonymous Gipuzkoan patricio Urquijo often conversed with (Tirso Olazabal?) used to exclaim at some of Urquijo’s theories: \\"you are sure great at destruction!\\", Michelena 1971, p. 63 Another line of conflict with the Aranists was their perceived obsession with linguistic purity, entangled in \\"extravagant etymologies\\" and \\"most grotesque hypotheses\\";Daniele Conversi, The Basques, the Catalans, and Spain: Alternative Routes to Nationalist Mobilisation, Reno 2000, , 9780874173628, p. 71 one of the SEV objectives was to wrest the language issue away from zealous nationalists,according to one scholar, the founders of SEV believed that economic growth and social change can no longer be left to the hazards of improvisation; they denounced lack of planning and pleaded for a guiding role not only in economic development but also in management of social change; they are dubbed \\"children of Englightenment in their postivist faith\\", Conversi 2000, pp. 70-71 especially that Urquijo personally appreciated internal variability of Basque dialects. Finally, the area of conflict with Arana and his followers was the cross-linguistic issue. Anchored in a European, cosmopolitan and aristocratic milieu,Monreal Zia 2001, p. 17 Urquijo adhered to extremely xenophile approach and envisioned Basque in a wide international cultural context,which was expressed in the title of his journal, Revista Internacional de los Estudios Vascos; Lacombe proposed another title, Revue Bascologique, Arana Martija 1993, p. 9 while Arana was anxious to protect genuine Basque from the outside influence.Arana Martija 1993, p. 8; \\"no se praponía provincianizar a Guipúzcoa sino al revés, desprovincianizarla, desaldeanizarla\\", Michelena 1971, p. 58 A fundamental issue facing SEV was unification of written Basque.Luis Villasante, Don Julio de Urquijo y el problema de la Unificación del Euskera Literario, [in:] Anuario del Seminario de Filología Vasca \\"Julio de Urquijo\\" 5 (1971), p. 30 For two distinct reasons Urquijo was firmly against taking any action; his scientific focus convinced him there was not enough linguistic evidence to take any course, and his predilection for dialects rendered it impossible to accept their marginalization for the sake of creating a common speak.Villasante 1971, pp. 33-4 To him, unification efforts resembled extravagant theories advanced by early vascólogos and purist fixation of the Aranists.Villasante 1971, p. 35, Hurch, Kerejeta 1997, p. 13 On the same basis, he opposed creation of Comisión de Neologismos,in 1928, proposed by Azkue as lexical growth was the matter of the pueblo, not the academy.Villasante 1971, p. 40 Though Urquijo appreciated the need of an orthodoxy, he did not consider it urgent and preferred to wait and see which dialect prevails.Villasante 1971, p. 35 He understood his role as stimulating this process by reprinting traditional Basque works, getting to know the Basque linguistic realm by means of scientific research and promoting the usage of Basque.Villasante 1971, p. 43 His stance prevailed, as both SEV and Euskaltzaindia did not adopt any decisive steps.Villasante 1971, pp. 39, 41 Some scholars claim that unification, finally decided in 1968, developed along the lines envisioned by Urquijo.Villasante 1971, p. 44 Vasconia tradicional Later-day vascólogos commented that SEV was tilted towards \\"Vasconia tradicional que de la Vasconia real\\" and suggested that Urquijo was heavily responsible for the bias.Michelena 1971, p. 61, quoted by Monreal Zia 2001, p. 22 It is also evident that following the course set by RIEV, SEV formatted its profile as focused on scientific research, somewhat leaning towards historical analysis, and refrained from assuming regulatory and normative role.in theory, apart from enhancing social status of Basque language by means of prestige, literacy, publishing and use in academic milieu, the goal of the Academy was also creating proper grammar, syntax and lexicon, Cconversi 2000, p. 71 This might have been heavily influenced by the vision of linguistics harbored by Urquijo.Michelena 1971, pp. 54-55 This could have been also the result of his wish to steer clear of potential conflict areas, such as nagging present-day issues, which might have wrecked SEV's impartiality and damaged its blank political profile.Monreal Zia 2001, p. 22-23 This did not spare Urquijo and SEV the charge of ideological bias. Though expressed first during late Francoism in somewhat Aesopian language, the point was that confessional nature of Basque cultural institutions of that eraUrquijo was highly religious. One of his favorite proverbs, expressed in a local Basque dialect, was \\"mind that the Lord keeps watching you from above\\" Michelena 1971, p. 64 was incompatible with strictly neutral stand.Michelena 1971, p. 61 Vascólogo: reception and legacy homage to Urquijo, 1949 Already in the early 20th century Urquijo started to gain wide recognition as a scholar. In 1909 nominated academico correspondiente of Real Academia de la HistoriaIdoia Estornés Zubizarreta, Julio Urquijo Ybarra entry, Robles Muñoz 1997, p. 44 and member of a number of prestigious bodies,like Linguistics Association of Paris, Academy of Bordeaux abroad and San Telmo Museum and a Committee of the Monuments in Gipuzkoa, Arana Martija 1993, p. 19, Lizundia Askondo 2007, p. 106 in 1924 he was named doctor honoris causa by University of Bonn.Idoia Estornés Zubizarreta, Julio Urquijo Ybarra entry In 1927 he was invited to Real Academia de la Lengua Española, Sección de Lenguas Regionales,this a section was created to accommodate Catalan, Gallego and Basque, see Real Academia service, available here which he joined formally in 1929.Robles Muñoz 1997, p. 44 In the 1930s his home, and especially its vast library, was considered \\"el Sancta Sanctorum de la tradición vasca\\", Urquijo himself named \\"su sumo sacerdote\\".Idoia Estornés Zubizarreta, Julio Urquijo Ybarra entry In 1942 he moved as catedratico to Salamanca to commence his only teaching episode.Monreal Zia 2001, p. 26 In 1949 he was declared hijo benemerito by the province of Gipuzkoa,Urquijo was already in bad health at that time, Maria Jesus Cava Mesa, Julio de Urquijo e Ybarra, vascófilo y erudito, [in:] Bilbao 8/2011, p. 31 with appropriate celebrations and the local Diputación publishing 3 volumes of homage materials.Idoia Estornés Zubizarreta, Julio Urquijo Ybarra entry The same year he was awarded Gran Cruz de Orden Civil de Alfonso X el Sabio.ABC 26.08.49, available here He died due to heart disease.affección cardíáca, ABC 29.10.50, available here In 1954, largely thanks to efforts of another Carlist vascólogo Antonio Arrue, the Gipuzkoan diputación set up Seminario de Filología Vasca \\"Julio de Urquijo\\", which soon started to issue its yearbook;Lizundia Askondo 2007, p. 106 the unit is very much active until today.compare the web page of Anuario del Seminario de Filología Vasca \\"Julio de Urquijo\\", available here The reborn Euskaltzaindia staged centenary celebrations of his birth in 1971, with a homage session and related publication.Arana Martija 1993, p. 19 His vast library was incorporated as Fondo Urquijo into the Koldo Mitxelena Kulturunea foundation, enhanced to 8,000 mongraphies and 11,000 other pieces.Hurch, Kerejeta 1997, p. 2 There are a few streets commemorating him in Spain, especially in his native area, Deusto,Cava Mesa 2011 though he earned no monument so far.

The protein encoded is predicted to be a nuclear protein; however, its exact function is currently unknown. C3orf70 can be identified with known aliases: Chromosome 3 Open Reading Frame 70, AK091454, UPF0524, and LOC285382. Gene In humans, C3orf70 is located on the reverse strand of Chromosome 3 at 3q27.2 (see Figure 1). This identifies its location starting 184,795,838 base pairs and ending 184,870,802 base pairs from PTER, the terminus of the short arm, on chromosome 3. C3orf70 spans 74,964 bases containing two exons and two introns. mRNA The transcribed mRNA is a 5,901 base pair transcript. C3orf70 consists of one known splice variant with two exons of 388 base pairs and 5,512 base pairs respectively (see Figure 2); location of junction occurs at 67aa[C]. A single 5’ cap and three possible 3’ polyadenylation signals have been identified. Protein Composition The translated protein is a 250 amino acid product. The precursor protein has been predicted with a molecular weight of 27.8kdal and an isoelectric point of 4.67. With 33 serines and 8 glysines, the C3orf70 protein is both Serine rich and Glycine poor. Domains C3orf70 protein has no known signal peptides or domains. Homology C3orf70 has no known paralogs in humans; however C3orf70 has conserved homologs, see Figure 3. Highly conserved across species excluding invertebrates, plants, fungi, and bacteria, C3orf70 shows a moderate rate of evolution, see Figure 4 and 5. File:C3orf70 Orthologs.pngFigure 3: Compiled data for select orthologs of C3orf70 across species File:C3orf70 Percent Non-identity vs Date of Divergence.pngFigure 4: C3orf70 Homolog Protein Divergence from Homo sapiens. Color identification specific to species (shown in Figure 3). Time of divergence calculated by timetree.org. Non-identity calculated based on (1-NCBI sequence identity). File:C3orf70 Rate of Divergence.pngFigure 5: Divergence rate of C3orf70 with respect to Cytochrome C and Fibrinogen displaying a moderate to slow rate of divergence. Regulation Transcription =Promoter= There is only one known promoter predicted by Genomatix for the C3orf70 protein located on the minus strand of chromosome 3 at location 184870702-184871302bp, therefore identified as 600bp in length. High mammalian conservation was observed for the identified promoter sequence. =Transcription factors= Figure 6: Generated list of a selection of transcription factor binding sites in the C3orf70 promoter Through the use of Genomatix, a table was generated of the top 20 transcription factors and their binding sites in the C3orf70 promoter (see Figure 6). Translation =Post-translational modifications= Utilizing NetPhos, a total of 25 phosphorylation sites have been predicted (20 Serines, 3 Threonines, and 2 Tyrosines) which occur throughout the protein indicating an intracellular localization. Figure 7 pinpoints the location of the 25 potential phosphorylation sites. Additionally, two N-myrisolation sites were predicted at amino acid position 40-45 and 210-215 indicating a possible N-terminus and C-terminus membrane anchor region. There are also 28 potential missense mutations in the human C3orf70. =Subcellular localization= PSORT II indicates the subcellular localization of C3orf70 is in the nucleus. In addition to this, following SDSC's Biology Workbench's SAPS kNN-Prediction, the C3orf70 protein for humans has a 60.9% likelihood to end up in the nuclear region of a cell, as determined by the amino acid make-up of C3orf70. Homologs including chimp, mouse, alligator, and zebrafish conclude the same nuclear region with a >60% likelihood. A nuclear localization site has not been identified in the C3orf70 sequence. Expression From Unigene's EST cDNA tissue abundance display (see Figure 8), C3orf70 is non-ubiquitously expressed and has relatively low expression levels with slightly higher expression levels seen in the brain. Also, microarray data profile GDS426 (see Figure 9) showing the expression of C3orf70 across normal tissues displays a notably high presence in the brain, spinal cord, and prostate tissue. Function and further reading The function of C3orf70 is unknown. It is suggested to be a nuclear protein that plays a role in neurological development. Additional avenues of research pertaining to the C3orf70 gene include: There is a patent that identified genes associated with midbrain dopamine neurons for engraftment by looking at the differentiation of hESC and/or hiPSC in floor plate midbrain progenitor cells. C3orf70 was found to have a fold-change of 2.45, which was not determined significant in experimentation A publication was discovered through multiple sources that linked the C3orf70 gene to a “Genome-wide association study of major depressive disorder”. A microdeletion has been identified from 3q26.33-3q27.2. Mandrille et al. associates this discovered microdeletion with a possible clinical syndrome characterized by clinical features related to brain development.

His father was provost of Kirkwall during the Jacobite rising of 1745, and was paid a pension by the Earls of Morton for his support of their electoral interests. However, in 1766 James Douglas, 14th Earl of Morton sold all his interests in Orkney to Sir Lawrence Dundas. At the 1768 general election Sir Lawrence installed as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Orkney and Shetland his older brother Thomas Dundas, who was returned unopposed. Thomas stood down in 1770, and the following year Thomas's son Captain Thomas Dundas was elected unopposed. He was returned unopposed at the 1774 general election. However, Sir Lawrence had alienated both the lairds and merchants of Orkney. When he opposed Lord North's government, the Orkney opposition received £300 from secret service funds to support a government candidate. Baikie was chosen to stand, and at the 1780 general election, Baikie was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Orkney and Shetland by 11 votes to the 5 won Sir Lawrence's nephew Charles Dundas. However, Baikie's election had been achieved only by excluding seven supporters of Dundas, and after an election petition the seat was awarded to Dundas on 28 February 1781.

After Holi and Janmashthami, it is the biggest and most popular religious occasion of the Vaishnavas. Known for its spectacular display of decorated swings, song and dance, Jhulan is a joyful festival celebrating the Radha-Krishna amour coupled with the romantic fervor of the rainy season in India. It is celebrated in the month of Shraavana, which takes place in July and August on the Gregorian calendar. The 2017 date is August 3-7.http://www.pujadatetime.in/2016/08/2017-jhulan-yatra-date-time-jhulan.html Origin sketch of Radha Krishna Jhulan Yatra has been inspired from the swing pastimes of Krishna and his consort Radha during their romance in the idyllic pastoral groves of Vrindavan, where the divine lovers along with their cowherd friends and gopis took part in joyful swinging in the cool monsoon season. These pastimes are mentioned in literature such as the Bhagavata Purana, the Harivamsa, and the Gita Govinda, and the metaphor of the swing of the monsoon or 'Sawan Ke Jhuley' have since been used by poets and songwriters to describe the romantic feeling that permeates the rainy season in the Indian subcontinent.http://hinduism.about.com/od/festivalsholidays/a/Jhulan-Yatra.htm The popular Krishna literature Hari Bhakti Vilasa (Performance of Devotion to Hari or Krishna) mentions Jhulan Yatra as part of the various festivals dedicated to Krishna: \\"…the devotees serve the Lord during the summer by placing Him on the boat, taking Him out on a procession, applying sandalwood on His body, fanning Him with chamara, decorating Him with jeweled necklaces, offering Him palatable foodstuffs, and bringing Him out to swing Him in the pleasant moonlight.\\" In Mathura, Vrindavan and Mayapur Of all the places in India, Mathura, Vrindavan, and Mayapur are most famous for Jhulan Yatra celebrations. During the thirteen days of Jhulan - from the third day of the bright fortnight of the Hindu month of Shravan (July–August) until the full moon night of the month, called Shravan Purnima, which usually coincides with the Raksha Bandhan festival - thousands of Krishna devotees throng from around the world to the holy cities of Mathura and Vrindavan in Uttar Pradesh, and Mayapur in West Bengal, India. The idols of Radha and Krishna are taken out from the altar and placed on heavily decked swings, which are sometimes made of gold and silver. Vrindavan's Shri Rup-Sanatan Goudiya Math, Banke Bihari Temple and Radha-Ramana Temple, Mathura's Dwarkadhish temple, and Mayapur's ISKCON temple are some of the major places where this festival is celebrated in their greatest grandeur. Celebrations at International Society for Krishna Consciousness Many Hindu organizations, especially the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, observe Jhulan for five days. At Mayapur, the world headquarters of the ISKCON, deities of Radha and Krishna are decorated and placed on an ornate swing in the temple courtyard for devotees to swing their favorite deities using a flowery rope while offering flower petals amid bhajans and kirtans. They dance and sing the popular hymns 'Hare Krishna Mahamantra,' 'Jaya Radhe, Jaya Krishna,' 'Jaya Vrindavan,' 'Jaya Radhe, Jaya Jaya Madhava' and other devotional songs. A special 'aarti' ritual is performed after the deities are placed on the swing, as devotees bring their 'bhog' or food offerings for the divine couple. Srila Prabhupada, the founder of ISKCON, prescribed the following rituals to honor Krishna on Jhulan Yatra: During these five days the deities' clothes should be changed daily, a nice prasad (food offering) be distribution, and sankirtan (group singing) should be performed. A throne may be constructed on which the deities (Radha and Krishna) can be placed, and swayed gently with accompanying music.

This handsome granite Classical Revival building was one of twelve post offices built in 1909, and is reflective of the government's trend at that time to use classical architecture as a way to express democratic ideals and institutions. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. Description and history The Bar Harbor Post Office stands on the north side of Cottage Street, just west of its junction with Federal Street and on the fringe of the main village's central business district. It is a substantial single-story structure, built out of Maine granite. Its main facade faces south, and is five bays wide, with banded pilasters, topped by medallions, separating the bays. The outer four bays have paired sash windows topped by keystones. The main entrance is in the central bay, surrounded by a stonework arch and topped by a triangular pediment. The building has a strong cornice line, topped by a parapet. Behind the parapet is a low-pitch hip roof pierced by three vaulted-arch dormers. The building's public lobby space is richly decorated with terrazzo marble flooring, marble wainscoting, and heavy woodwork surrounds for the interior doors and service windows. The ceiling has ornamental plaster decoration. Bar Harbor's post office was designed in 1908 by James Knox Taylor, the supervising architect of the United States Department of the Treasury, and was completed in 1909. Its construction was authorized by Tarsney Act and the Omnibus Building Act of 1902, and its individualized design was reflective of the government's return to the use of Classical styling as an expression of democratic ideals and institutions. The building is located in an area that was hard hit by Bar Harbor's devastating 1947 fire.

History Cater Brothers Supermarkets was a natural progression for a family of butchers and greengrocers. Henry Charles Cater (1818-1868) was a pork merchant and latterly a pork Butcher in the East End of London. Three of his four sons went on to become a cheesemonger, a grocer and a provisions merchant. Henry John Cater, one of Henry Charles's sons, is shown in the 1881 census as being a grocer in Bridge Street, Mile End. It was his five sons who took the business over after his death in 1919, with his son Erastus being appointed chairman of the board. By the start of the Second World War the business had around 30 stores. In 1956, Leslie Erastus, son of Erastus, had taken over the running of the business and was keen to move the company into the new self-service supermarket business. The first supermarket was opened in Bromley in 1958, with branches being added across the South East at a rate of around one a year. The new chain had stores as far away as Reading and Colchester, all supplied by a depot in Dagenham. In 1972, Leslie Erastus was killed when a plane, piloted by rival supermarket owner F J Wallis of Wallis Supermarkets, crashed in the French Alps. After his death, the Cater family decided to accept an offer of £7 million for the business from Debenhams, in 1973. Debenhams integrated the business with their 40 food halls, which were modernised and branded as Cater Food Halls and opened a further two new Cater supermarkets. However the business struggled in the competitive 1970s market, and in 1979, Debenhams sold the business to Allied Suppliers for £9.5 million. Allied Suppliers integrated the new stores into their Presto chain and the Cater Brothers brand was no more. The Cater name, however, lives on Chelmsford, with an office block that was built above the store still carrying the Cater House name.

After founding a school for Jewish children in Nazi Germany, she emigrated to the United States in 1939 and established Camp Catawba, a summer camp for boys. Early life in Germany Lachmann was born in 1904 in Berlin, into a family of German-Jewish heritage. After attending a private school for girls, she enrolled in the Humboldt University of Berlin and the University of Basel in 1923 to study philology, language and literature. She earned a PhD from the University in Berlin in 1931, and planned to go on to teach at the university level. However, due to the bias against women in the field of tertiary education, she trained instead to teach at the Gymnasium (secondary school) level. In 1933, shortly after Adolf Hitler assumed power in Germany, Lachmann founded a private school for children of Jewish and Jewish-Christian parents who had been expelled from public schools. The school, which was held on the property of Lachmann's relatives, was closed by Nazi officials shortly after Kristallnacht in 1938. Emigration to the United States Lachmann left Germany for the United States in November 1939, assisted by friends in both countries. She worked at Vassar College's German department until 1941, and subsequently taught at Salem College for two years, Bryn Mawr College for one year, and Yale University for two years. She also held brief positions at the City College of New York and Brooklyn College. Castrum Peregrini Press published three volumes of her poetry, which were heavily influenced by Ancient Greek literature, in both German and (translated) English. In 1944, Lachmann founded Camp Catawba, a summer camp for boys in Blowing Rock, North Carolina. She directed the camp until its closure in 1970. The camp's focus was a balance of recreation and the arts, and each year Lachmann directed the young campers in a play, some of which were by William Shakespeare. She also chose ancient Greek works by Aristophanes, Aeschylus and Sophocles; she translated Sophocles' tragedy Philoctetes herself for a camp production. Lachmann's life partner was Tui St. George Tucker, an American composer whom Lachmann met in 1946 when Tucker began working as a music instructor at Camp Catawba. Death Lachmann died in January 1985 at Saint Vincent's Catholic Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 80 years old. References Further reading *Miller, Charles (ed.) (2004).

After Make Me Famous broke up, he founded Down & Dirty but shortly left that band in the wake of his involvement with Asking Alexandria. However, Stoff parted ways with Asking Alexandria in 2016 when the band reunited with Danny Worsnop. He is currently the lead vocalist for the band Drag Me Out.  Music career  2009–2010 Stoff experimented in electronic music with a short lived project called Cat!Cow!MilkyWay!.

Speculation regarding Stoff's involvement started shortly after Worsnop's departure due to similarities between Asking Alexandria and Make Me Famous (who were said to have been ripping off the band); the fact that they were label mates would have made the transition easy for Stoff to make, and on his personal YouTube account he had covered multiple Asking Alexandria songs. Ben Bruce was asked if he considered anyone else for the role and he stated that \\"it has to be Denis\\" before praising his vocal ability. When Shaforostov himself was asked how he would distinguish himself from Worsnop, he stated he would not make any comparison since he is a completely different person. In October 2016, Ben Bruce announced that Stoff left the band. In December 2017, Rock Sound interviewed Denis. Denis explained that his home country, Ukraine, is like a warzone now. He said there was stress for him and his family, and he had to stop touring to focus on family. 2017–present: Drag Me Out Stoff posted on Twitter on 27 September 2017 \\"New album and new band... so worth every minute of the work and da wait we've already invested in this. Be ready for something new and FRESH.\\" Stoff with his new band Drag Me Out released their first single, titled I'm Sorry, on 15 January 2019. An accompanying music video was also released. On 1 February 2019, the band surprise dropped their debut album Pressure. Shortly after the album's release, connections were made between Drag Me Out's \\"Hollow\\" and Asking Alexandria's \\"Alone in a Room\\" sounding similar in terms of instruments and the bridge section of the song, afterwards the band's label Sumerian Records (who are also Asking Alexandria's label) took down the song from their official YouTube channel.

The group tied and beat the policemen manning the outpost and stole weapons and radios. They stayed for a couple of hours, filming the event, and issued a message through an interpreter before leaving. Background Skopje government attack On October 28, 2014, at 22.00, the Macedonian government building was shelled, damaging the walls and roof of the building. No casualties were registered. It has been speculated that the event was linked to the recent proclamation of the so-called \\"Republic of Ilirida\\", part of the Greater Albanian project. The projectiles were likely fired from a rocket- propelled grenade (RPG) launcher, likely the same used in the 2007 attack. The National Liberation Army (NLA), the militant organization that fought against the Macedonian government in the Insurgency in the Republic of Macedonia (2001), claimed responsibly for the attack. The organization, in the letter signed by \\"Kushtrimi\\" to the government, claimed that the \\"Hasan Prishtina\\" elite force hit the government building in a coordinated action. The organization claims it is discontent with the 2001 Ohrid Agreement.  Assault on Gošince  On 21 April 2015, a group of 40 armed men with NLA patches attacked a border police station located at Gošince, near the Kosovo border. The group tied the policemen and beat them, then stole their arms and communication devices; they stayed for a couple of hours, filming the event, and before they left for Kosovo, they issued this message through an interpreter: \\"We are from the National Liberation Army. Tell them that neither Ali Ahmeti nor Nikola Gruevski can save you. We do not want any framework agreement and if we see you here again, we will kill you. We want our own state.\\" The state issued a statement that this was \\"a terrorist attack on the state\\". The police has stepped up security in the area. Gošince is 99% Albanian, and was a site of the Insurgency in the Republic of Macedonia (2001) in which the fought against the Macedonian government seeking basic rights for the Albanian population in Macedonia. On 22 April an unofficial police source alleged that the group was led by Xhevair Ademi, while other identified individuals were brothers Erhan and Kadir Bajrami, and a Faruk who managed the attack, all from Gjilan in Kosovo. The identified persons, now numbering five, are known to the Macedonian Security Service, as well as those of the region. According to Pristina media, on 22 April, the attack was claimed by the NLA, signed by \\"Commander Flamuri\\". On 24 April, President Nikola Gruevski was accused by the opposition to have staged the attack. On 26 April, Macedonian police recovered illegal arms from the villages of Gošince, Brest and Malina Mahala. Some of the arms found in Malina Mahala were those stolen in the attack. On 27 April, Osman Sulejman was indicted for the attack, while Mirsad Ndrecaj \\"Commander NATO\\" (a Kosovo Liberation Army and NLA veteran) was said by Interior Minister Gordana Jankuloska to have been involved in the attack, having assumed responsibility for the attack. On 9 June, Macedonian daily newspaper, Dnevnik reported that the OSCE Mission to Skopje had advance knowledge of the Gošince border post attack and that the OSCE Mission did not share this information with the security services.http://www.dnevnik.mk/default.asp?ItemID=71ACDAC8D4B3AA4180198FD483EE44F9http://macedoniaonline.eu/content/view/27534/45/ Aftermath On 3 May 2015, a bomb was thrown at building of the Democratic Union for Integration, the party established by the NLA leadership.

Although an Alien Act was passed in 1793 and remained in force to some extent or other until 1836, there were no controls between then and 1905 barring a very loosely policed system of registration on entry. The development of in-country enforcement controls is dealt with separately—see UK immigration enforcement.  History   1905 Aliens Act and the Immigration Boards  The beginnings of the modern-day UK immigration control can be traced from the final decade of the 19th Century and the political debate that grew surrounding the perceived growth in the numbers of Eastern European Jews coming to the UK. Political alarm was also expressed regarding the rising numbers of foreign national criminals in UK prisons, the growing demands on poor relief within local parishes and fears of degenerating health and housing conditions. There was particular focus on the large numbers of Russian and Polish Jews who had arrived in the East End of London after fleeing persecution in the Russian Empire. In 1898 the Secretary of the Board of Trade reported a \\"..stream of Russian and Polish immigration—in other words, the immigration of the most destitute type...increasing in volume year by year\\". The numbers of arrivals were highly debatable owing to the deficiencies in available statistics. Concerns focussed on perceived overcrowding in the East End of London. The legislation that finally emerged was the Aliens Act 1905 which was considered even at the time a flawed and inconsistent piece of legislation. It was ambivalent in its aims and constructed powers whose ostensible aim was that they should be equally applied but its underlying aim was to control a particular “problem” group. Libertarian opponents of the Act ensured that it only applied to steerage passengers and to ships carrying more than 20 passengers. It was easily evaded, and did not even require Immigration Officers to give written permission to land or stamp a passport – permission to land was given verbally. It was, however, the first legislation to define some groups of migrants as 'undesirable', thereby making entry to the United Kingdom discretionary, rather than automatic. The Act ensured that leave to land could be withheld if the immigrant was judged to fall into one of four categories: * a) if he cannot show that he has in his possession ... the means of decently supporting himself and his dependents; * b) if he is a lunatic or an idiot or owing to any disease of infirmity liable to become a charge upon the public rates; * c) if he has been sentenced in a foreign country for a crime, not being an offense of a political character; or * d) if an expulsion order under this act has [already] been made. People refused entry under the act were given a right of appeal to the Immigration Board in charge of control of one of the designated ports listed by statute and the practical application of the control was conducted by the new Aliens Inspectorate and its officers, the first Immigration Officers, who were hurriedly recruited from within the existing ranks of HM Customs and the Board of Trade. Their basic task was to test whether the traveler had means of support which might be proven by either presentation of cash or evidence of a firm offer of employment. The inspection generally took place aboard ships or in “receiving houses” on shore. The anomalies within the regulations meant that it was common for passengers to evade the control by the simple means of posing as 2nd or 3rd class passengers or sharing the evidence of funds between them. The head of the new organization was titled HM Inspector and its first incumbent was Mr. William Haldane Porter.  1914-1918: Immigration control during the First World War  1914 marked a landmark in UK immigration control in that it was only from this point that every person entering the country had to produce evidence of identity. The 1914 Aliens Registration Act was rushed through Parliament in a single day on the eve of the First World War and allowed stricter controls than before including the power to make aliens aged over 16 register with the police. The power still remains in use. Although the 1905 Act technically survived until its repeal in 1919, it was, in practice, submerged by the far more stringent powers of the Aliens Restriction Act of 1914. The 1914 Act contained a clause which gave the Home Secretary power to prevent the entry and order the deportation of aliens if it was deemed 'conducive to the public good'. For the purposes of the 1914 legislation immigration officers were re- titled Aliens Officers and the service was a compound of Home Office staff and Customs staff. In order to mark someone's arrival and departure the new Aliens Officers endorsed the passports of passengers with red stamps on arrival and with black stamps to cancel the endorsement on the persons departure. In April 1915 an Order in Council was made that no alien passenger was to be allowed to land unless he held either a passport with a photograph attached issued within the two preceding years, or some other document establishing his national status and identity. Prior to this passports had not contained photographs and had not been stamped in any way.The Key in the Lock - TWE Roche, 1st ed p. 83–84 From April 1915 only passengers with exit permits were allowed to leave the UK, and then only from certain ports. In an extension to their duties that would be repeated during World War 2, officers were tasked with retrieving ration documents from departing passengers. In 1916 a “Traffic Index” was created from the landing and embarkation cards collected at ports and matched together at the Home Office's Aliens Branch HQ to show whether the person had complied with their conditions of entry. This simple process was the only mechanism for measuring the effectiveness of the control and continued until 1998 when embarkation controls were abolished. By 1920, the number of Aliens' Officers had reached 160.  Immigration controls in the 1920s and 1930s  The Aliens Order 1920 was a statutory instrument made under the 1919 Aliens Restriction Act. Brought out in the context of widespread unemployment after the First World War, it required all aliens seeking employment or residence to register with the police. The Order drew its powers from the 1919 Act and granted a wide-ranging discretion to the Home Secretary. It stipulated that no alien might land without the permission of an immigration officer, by way of a passport stamp, and granted powers to attach conditions to the grant of leave, to refuse those who could not support themselves, and their dependants, those medically unfit and those convicted of crimes abroad. It gave the power to demand documents satisfactorily establishing identity and nationality. It restricted the employment rights of aliens resident in Britain, barring them from certain jobs (in the civil service, for example), and had a particular impact on foreign seamen working on British ships. It required people seeking employment in the UK to obtain permission from the Ministry of Labour, which was of huge significance in establishing a link, for the first time, between immigration control and the employment market. It also targeted criminals, paupers and ‘undesirables’, and made it illegal for aliens to promote industrial action – a response to fears of imported revolutionaries following the still recent Russian Revolution. Further motivation to extend restrictions on foreigners was driven by post-war unemployment and the consequent desire to safeguard jobs for indigenous Britons. The 1919 Act was renewed annually until 1971 until it was replaced by the Immigration Act 1971. A new dimension to the work arrived in the 1920s where the influx of visitors to the Wembley Exhibition meant that the traffic generated by air travel could no longer be ignored. It was decided to appoint one immigration officer to deal with incoming passengers at the main London airport in Croydon. By 1925 the Immigration Officer at Croydon Airport was dealing with 15 aircraft movements per day. By 1937 the total numbers of people arriving by air reached 37,348, still a paltry number when compared to the numbers arriving by sea, 498,326.Home Office Statistics of Foreigners Arriving in the United Kingdom, 1959, HMSO, Cmnd 994 The numbers arriving at seaports would continue to rise, but would be outstripped by the late 1950s by the rise of air travel. The 1930s were marked by the ever-increasing numbers of refugees arriving from Europe fleeing from Nazi Germany. Refugee arrivals rose from close to zero in 1930 to 3109 in 1933. By 1938 the annual figure was 11,000. After 1936 the figures were augmented by the numbers fleeing from war-torn Spain. Although there was no publicly stated policy for the admission of political refugees before 1971, a settled but implicit approach had emerged during the 1930s. The handling of refugees was largely dependent on their being able to show that they could maintain themselves or be maintained. The Immigration Service cooperated with the Jewish support organizations who worked to provide support or provide sponsors but there was no agreed international approach to the handling of refugees. A Home Secretary memo to the Cabinet in 1933 shows that efforts were made to take a flexible approach but admitted that some refugees, (\\"a few\\") had been refused and returned to France where they awaited a relaxation of the rules. Restrictions placed on Jewish refugees were based mainly on economic fears for the employment market.National Archive - memo to Cabinet 1933 - Jewish refugees - http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documentsonline/download.asp?T=2697608&S;=I/11/02585815T&E;=bp%2Ecatfish%40gmail%2Ecom Statistics for 1938 and 1939 show Germans as being the top nationality refused entry for both yearsForeign Nationals Entering and Leaving the UK 1938-1951, HMSO - Germans refused in 1938, 274; 1939, 481 and it is likely that a large proportion of these were potential refugees being returned to an uncertain fate. That said, the UK admitted more Germans than any other nationality in 1939 and continued to admit Germans throughout the war.4646 German nationals were for instance admitted in 1941. Foreign Nationals Entering the UK 1938-1951, HMSO. In late November 1938 the UK Parliament agreed to allow up to 15,000 unaccompanied children to enter Britain as refugees from the Nazis. Almost 10,000 such children from several European countries, but principally from Germany, were rescued by Britain in what became known as the Kindertransport. The first transport left Germany in December 1938 with most ending at the outbreak of war, but a final Kindertransport left the Netherlands in May 1940. An ever-increasing number of passengers travelled in happier circumstances on the great liners of the day. The RMS Queen Mary for instance presented problems in quickly clearing large numbers of passengers and to do so within Victorian Customs Sheds was increasingly impractical. Shipping companies invited a, no doubt very agreeable, solution whereby Immigration Officers travelled 1st class on the liner itself or pre-cleared passengers in Cherbourg. In 1936 air traffic had grown to such an extent that a Chief Immigration Officer was appointed to take charge at Croydon Airport with additional responsibilities for immigration control in the new Gatwick terminal, which with its very own direct rail link to London and art deco architecture was the last word in airport design until it was replaced in the 1950s.  1939-1945: Immigration control during the Second World War  War brought with it new emergency powers which meant that the Immigration Service now, as well as continuing to control the entry of a wave of displaced people, had to screen refugees, enforce rules on exit permits for all people leaving the UK and to take on the additional work of repatriating some enemy aliens. Ireland's neutrality meant that steps had to be taken to introduce new controls between the UK and Republic. The Passenger Traffic Order 1939 remained in force until 1952 and a large proportion of the work of the immigration service during the war was taken up by the control of Irish workers seeking employment in the growing war economy. Croydon Airport was closed and became a fighter base; its passenger traffic transferred to Shoreham. The Dunkirk evacuation brought with it not only rescued troops but also vast numbers of refugees and displaced people who had to be screened. Large numbers of Dutch and Belgian refugees were temporarily placed in camps on Brownsea Island in Poole harbour. The possibility of enemy agents gaining entry under the guise of being part of this group was very real and Immigration Service staff were seconded to interview refugees and displaced people at special reception centres. The main one of these was the Royal Victoria Patriotic School at Wandsworth in London, whose MI6 interrogators included Colonel Oreste Pinto. During four years over 30,000 people were interviewed at this centre. Other wartime work involving Immigration staff included the examination of British refugees exchanged with the Germans via Lisbon. As the passenger traffic through the channel ports shrank, the efforts of border control were focused on the merchant shipping that kept Britain's lifelines open and many staff were redeployed to Scottish ports, Bristol and English northern ports for the duration. An office was also set up at Dartmouth to deal with the Channel convoys. Staff were also later deployed to Poole to deal with flying boat services which flew routes to Lisbon via Ireland and were of especial interest because of those seeking to exit occupied Europe. In Scotland the great \\"Queens\\" brought troop ships containing up to 15,000 troops each. The ports of Glasgow and Gourock pooled their resources to deal with the Russian convoys. Scottish immigration staff also covered the airports at Dyce and Leuchars, (which played their part as terminals for the dangerous Mosquito service to Stockholm), and found themselves occasionally giving a reception to escaped resistance fighters arriving in the Shetland Islands. In the first six months of 1940 Scottish immigration officers examined almost 4000 survivors from upwards of 100 ships sunk by enemy action. Some of these were found to be spies, and duly executed.  1945-1961: Post-war growth of Commonwealth immigration  Cover from the 1949 UK Immigration Service \\"Handbook of the Peculiarities of Foreign Names\\" with introduction by HM Chief Inspector W.R.

Re-establishing normal controls after the war took time to accomplish.Roche, T.W.E. (1969). The Key in the Lock: a history of immigration control in England from 1066 to the present day. London: John Murray. . Dover was eventually fully staffed again after a gap of six years and Croydon airport was reopened to passenger traffic. Southampton was faced with a rising number of passenger liners returning to peacetime service. A far reaching report by the Croydon Inspector after the war reviewed the processes for dealing with the growing number of air passengers. It suggested that these should, in future, be separated into inbound and outbound control areas and that arriving passengers should be marshalled or “funnelled” into one control area regardless of what aircraft they had arrived on. In 1946 the major airport controlling air traffic was Hurn Airport in Dorset. Although well organised, its location so far from London made it unpopular with carriers. It was agreed that the main passenger airport for London would be Heathrow, which opened on 1 May 1946 and came under the command of the Croydon Inspector. It was still a time of displaced people finding their way home after the war and passenger liners still travelled to the West Indies to return servicemen who had been de-mobbed. The owners of the shipping lines sought to reduce their costs for return journeys, which promised to otherwise have few passengers, and offered cut price fares to the UK. The first of these vessels to arrive, in 1947, was the now little remembered MV Ormonde which brought 108 migrant workers and attracted little notice. The arrival of the MV Empire Windrush, generated far greater attention. She arrived at Tilbury and brought with her approximately 500 regular passengers and a large number of stowaways as reported by Pathe news. Over and above the continuing movement of displaced people there were other signs of re-adjustment following the end of the war. The Polish Resettlement Act 1947 allowed 200,000 Polish citizens to stay following the war and it took until 1952 for the wartime restrictions on travel between the UK and Ireland to be abolished and a Common Travel Area was created between all the islands which still exists today. From the early 1950s immigration officers were allocated to deal with the residual screening of people who had arrived during and after the war who had still to have their status regularised. The 1953 Aliens Order replaced the 1920 Order and consolidated various other statutory instruments since World War 1. The 1950s brought special challenges such as the influx of visitors for the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953, a year which also saw the opening of the new passenger car ferry terminal at Eastern Docks, Dover. Despite the increase in traffic the numbers of those detained on entry remained small. During the parliamentary debate for the 1953 Act the Home Secretary was asked how many people were currently in detention and advised that on 22 July 1953 the total number of immigration detainees in the UK was 11. The position of refugees had been under review since the war. Questions had necessarily been posed as to whether more could and should have been done to save Jewish refugees fleeing Nazi persecution. The result was the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Stateless Persons. Originally intended to encompass only European refugees it was later extended to all countries. Overlapping waves of refugees had to be dealt with in the wake of the Suez Crisis and Hungarian Revolution of 1956. Between 19 November and 3 December 1956, 4221 refugees arrived at Dover and the Immigration Service was increasingly hard pressed. At that time it numbered fewer than 400 staff, including managers, to cover 30 different ports across the United Kingdom 24 hours per day and seven days a week. In 1959, a watershed moment arrived where, for the first time, more passengers arrived by air than by sea, (741,669 to 738,367). After the mid 1950s employers were prompted by a general labour shortage to recruit directly from the West Indies. The London Transport executive made an agreement with the Barbadian Immigration Liaison Service. Other employers, such as the British Hotel and Restaurant Association, made similar agreements. In the 1950s most Indian migrant workers to arrive in Britain were Sikhs from the rural areas of the Punjab, where the partition of the Punjab between India and Pakistan had created immense pressure on land resources during the 1950s and 1960s, greatly increasing such emigration from then on. In the period immediately before and after the introduction of the 1962 Act, the entry of dependents into Britain increased almost threefold as families attempted to 'beat the act', amidst widespread fears that Britain planned to permanently close its doors to its citizens in the New Commonwealth, including the families of those already living in Britain. Total \\"New\\" Commonwealth immigration thus grew from 21,550 entrants in 1959, to 58,300 in 1960. A year later this last figure had more than doubled and a record 125,400 \\"New\\" Commonwealth immigrants entered the UK in 1961. Consideration of legislation to place controls on Commonwealth citizens had by 1960 already been under active consideration for some years. A Cabinet committee comprising senior Cabinet members including the Home Secretary produced a report in 1956 which detailed the numbers of arriving black and Asian migrants in the early 1950s.National Archives CAB 129/81 Colonial Immigrants, Report of the Committee of Ministers - http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documentsonline/details- result.asp?Edoc_Id=7973762&queryType;=1&resultcount;=50 It directly addressed what it saw as the key issue of migration from \\"coloured territories\\". The report discussed the possibility that the British public might react badly to a law that was seen to be overtly racist and attempted to address the central difficulty of putting legislation into place that met its aims without appearing to be racially motivated. It noted, \\"There is no doubt that even though a Bill...would in form be non-discriminatory, it would nevertheless be clear against whom the Bill was really directed\\". The committee agreed that, presentationally, it would be best to emphasise the potential housing shortages that further migration might bring about.  1962-1968: Post- imperial restrictions  The Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962 came about as a result of growing public and political unease regarding the impact of migration from the, now fast declining, British Empire. West Indian immigration, (especially), had, since the war, continued to grow fairly gently but steadily until there were by 1956 around 100,000 new West Indian migrants in the UK. There were echoes of the public outcry which had brought about the 1905 Act and the political arguments, in public at least, similarly attempted to focus on the economic control of migrant labour and attempted to skirt around the underlying racial prejudices that were voiced by their constituents. Whatever the motivations of those concerned, it was clear that the common citizenship status shared by the various members of the Empire, or Commonwealth, as it was becoming known, was untenable with a world population growing more mobile. There was also a better understanding than there had been in 1948 that Britain's world position had irrevocably changed as it moved away from the assumptions of empire towards potential membership of the European Economic Community. The new Act was seen by its opponents as draconian, but it created only limited powers to deal with those who misrepresented their intentions or entered illegally. Preparations to implement the new Act included a recruitment campaign in 1962 which brought the staffing of the Immigration Service up to 500 ready for the start date on 1 July 1962. Commonwealth governments had warned that the new restrictions would create a black market in forged documentation and they were proven correct. The 1960s saw an emergent boom, in immigration terms, of bogus students. A market grew in bogus colleges and forged documents provided by racketeers who would, for a price, provide a complete package comprising travel, documents and illegal work. They commonly reclaimed their investment on a proportion of the migrant's illicit wages. Other developing trends included bogus marriages and forged birth certificates which were designed to allow “children” to join relatives in the UK as dependants despite being clearly above the permitted age. The Immigration Branch, and the administrative HQ at Princeton House in High Holborn, were limited in their ability to combat these abuses. The entire administrative strength of the Immigration and Nationality Dept was approximately 300national Archive Fleming Report 1963- CAB 129/114 - http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documentsonline/download.asp?T=2696834&S;=I/11/02585072P&E;=bp%2Ecatfish%40gmail%2Ecom and before 1962 IND was divided into three \\"Divisions\\" B1, (casework), B2, (policy) and A2, (admin). In 1962 another Division was created, B3, to deal with deportation casework. No formal operational enforcement and detection structure was to come into being until the 1970s and realistic legal powers to deal with illegal migrants would not appear until 1973 with the implementation of the 1971 Act. The quality of Entry Clearances, (Visas), issued abroad in the newly controlled Commonwealth countries also gave cause for concern when presented at British ports. The initial assumption when the 1962 Act was introduced was that these would be taken at face value on arrival. An instruction to Immigration Officers created a general understanding that written entry conditions would only be recorded and stored in exceptional circumstances. By 1965 new instructions had been issuedNational Archive 1966 - Roy Jenkins memo to Cabinet - New instructions to Immigration Officers -http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documentsonline/DoLUserDownload/bpcatfish@gmailcom/CAB/129/126/0/0004.pdf which, although very liberal by later standards, encouraged control officers to impose conditions more often and to refuse people who had clearly obtained entry clearances by misrepresentation. The notorious and highly emotive Rivers of Blood speech by Enoch Powell in 1968 changed the political landscape for anyone attempting to consider practical, administrative issues for many years to come. Thirty-nine Heathrow immigration officers, very unwisely, wrote to Enoch Powell in support of tougher controls whereupon he made their note public. Although their concerns were based on what they saw as a lack of administrative powers to do their job effectively they did, by associating themselves with the speech, damage their impartiality as Civil Servants and they were disciplined as a consequence. On 8 June 1968 Immigration Officers at Heathrow detained James Earl Ray, the murderer of Martin Luther King, Jr., attempting to travel on a false passport.  1968-1978: New laws and European Union membership  The key events leading to the hurried introduction of the Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1968 were the independence of, first, Kenya and, later, Uganda and Tanzania. Each of these countries at independence had an established minority population of Indian origin, some of whom had been introduced into East Africa by Britain which, as colonial power, had employed them on construction projects. Many had left India before its independence and before the creation of Pakistan, and their only citizenship was that of the UK and Colonies. The potential numbers of those eligible to travel to the UK created alarm, and the Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1968 was rushed through Parliament. The new Act provided that British subjects would be free from immigration control only if they, or at least one of their parents or grandparents, had been born, adopted, registered or naturalised in the UK. The issue of a passport by a British High Commission thus ceased to be a qualification for entry free of control. For those subject to control, another voucher system was introduced. This one was based on tight quotas. The 1968 Act directly, and deliberately, favoured white commonwealth citizens more likely to have British ancestry. Cabinet papers released in 2002 showed that the thrust of the legislation was designed to have this effect. By the end of the 1960s the previous practice of detaining immigration offenders in prison was increasingly unworkable as numbers of detainees rose. A dedicated facility was opened near Heathrow in a disused RAF base which became the Harmondsworth Immigration Removal Centre. At Gatwick Airport temporary detention accommodation was located in the disused 1930s air terminal and housed around 15 detainees. By the end of the 1960s immigration legislation and rules were drawn from too many sources. Consensus was reached that a completely new Immigration Act was needed to tighten controls, clarify the rules and unify the law for foreign and commonwealth nationals. This major reappraisal and consolidation of immigration law coincided with an expansion of the Immigration Branch administrative HQ, change of name and a change of location. In 1972 the Immigration and Nationality Department relocated from High Holborn to Croydon where it took up residence at the recently built Lunar House. The Immigration Branch at ports of entry was retitled the Immigration Service. Lunar House; since 1972 the HQ of UK Immigration. The Immigration Act 1971 gave right of abode in the UK to those it defined as ‘patrials’. These were: #citizens of the UK and Colonies who had that citizenship (i) by birth, adoption, naturalization, or registration in the UK; #citizens of the UK and Colonies whose parent or grandparent had that citizenship by those same means at the time of the birth of the person in question; #citizens of the UK and Colonies with five years’ ordinary residence in the UK; #Commonwealth citizens whose parent or grandparent was born or adopted in the UK before their birth; #Commonwealth citizens married to a patrial man. The Act replaced employment vouchers with Work permits, allowing only temporary residence. Commonwealth citizens who had been settled in the UK for five years when the Act came into force, (1 January 1973), also had the right to register and thus possibly the right of abode. Others would be subject to immigration controls. Apart from the five-year residence qualification, the right to live in the UK and to enter free from immigration control was determined by birth or parentage, not by nationality. On the same day that the new Act came into force, 1 January 1973, the UK entered the European Economic Community (EEC). At the same time that immigration restrictions were confirmed for Commonwealth citizens with a traditional allegiance to Britain, a new category of privilege was created for the European nationals who had formed the bulk of the work of the Immigrations Service for the preceding 50 years. Membership of the European Community, now the European Union, encompassed the freedom of movement of workers within member states. The practical reality of membership from an immigration control standpoint was that EU nationals were separated from other arriving passengers. As, in theory at least, they could be excluded or deported, (for instance following criminal conviction), there still continued checks against warnings lists. By 1970 the staff numbers within the Immigration Service had risen to approximately 1100 - rather more than double the administration workers at its London HQ. Despite the legislation of 1968 and 1971, the numbers of Commonwealth citizens coming to settle still caused political anxiety - especially where projections of future trends were based on a list of vague assumptions. The lack of reliable statistics and access to data was to be a recurring theme throughout the 1980s and beyond. The old \\"Traffic Index\\" of manually collated landing and embarkation cards was replaced by a new computer system, (INDECS), in 1979 but the primitive database was a limited success and the use of paper cards continued. Immigration Officers working in 24-hour ports-of-entry only had access to the main immigration database via telephone during office hours Monday to Friday.  1979-1989: Expansion, new visa controls, and carriers liability  The incoming Conservative administration in 1979 acted to introduce more legislation - the British Nationality Act 1981- which again tightened citizenship criteria. From an immigration control standpoint there was growing concern, and heated debate, concerning the restrictions placed on foreign spouses joining UK partners. There was evidence that marriage was being used by some as a means to circumvent the stricter settlement rules and a particular focus on applications from the Indian sub-continent. In the absence of overseas visa controls there was an incentive for prospective spouses to attempt to gain entry as visitors and apply for stay on the basis of marriage once in the UK once the marriage had taken place. The attempts by the Immigration Service at ports to investigate suspected bogus marriages impacted on cultural sensitivities where the differences between marriages arranged legitimately according to custom and those arranged for immigration purposes were notoriously difficult to separate. To investigate the complexities of the applications within a port of entry control environment was far from ideal and the Service was criticised for insensitivity in its dealings with these cases, especially in the misuse of medical examinations. In 1983 new immigration rules regarding marriage were introduced which required people to satisfy IND and UKIS that the \\"primary purpose\\" of the marriage was not for immigration purposes. The thrust of IND's policy throughout the 1980s was to continue to reassure public and political opinion that the numbers of those settling in the UK was under control and to try and take the heat out the immigration issue. The emphasis on settlement statistics remained the most important statistical indicator until the steep rise in asylum numbers in the early 1990s. The pressures on the inbound controls presented by the growth in numbers and rates of refusal for some nationalities meant that, by 1986, there was increasing pressure for new visa requirements. On 1 September 1986, new visa restrictions were announced for India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nigeria and Ghana. For reasons which are unclear the visa restrictions did not come into force until 15 October (23 October for Ghana). The ensuing panic over the weeks in between the announcement and implementation of the new rules brought Heathrow Airport to a standstill and the evening television news bulletins contained footage of hundreds of detainees camped in the main arrivals hall at Terminal 3 awaiting processing. Growing pressures on immigration detention accommodation resulted in an attempt to provide additional capacity by means of a floating detention centre. The Earl William was an ex cross-channel ferry refitted for a new role as a static, secure holding facility moored at Harwich. Its use provoked hostile opposition but the Home Office pressed forward with the idea and the Earl William was contracted into service under the management of Securicor, who had been running immigration detention facilities since 1970. Acceptance of the new arrangements required that the Earl William prove itself as cost effective, humane and secure. In October 1987 the strongest gale to hit England in 200 years broke the vessel free of its moorings and it ran aground on a sandbank. Although none of its 78 detainees was injured, the credibility of the exercise was fatally undermined and it was not used again. The 1987 Carriers Liability Act sought to place greater responsibility on those bringing passengers to the UK to verify that their documentation was in order. The Act gave powers to fine the carrier £1000 for each inadmissible passenger. This fine was doubled in August 1991 and two years later extended to cover passengers without transit visas where these were required. This applied as much to lorry drivers and owners of small aircraft as it did to international airlines and was fiercely resisted by the transport lobby. The numbers of clandestine illegal entrants continued to increase despite the sanctions imposed. In 1998 8000 illegal entrants were detected arriving clandestinely where, in 1992, there had been 500. The Act insisted that carriers, including hauliers, should take responsibility for those they brought to the UK but allowed that carriers could not be expected to be experts in forged or counterfeit documents. The fine was applied however where, in the opinion of the Immigration Service, the forgery was \\"readily apparent\\". Carriers were also fined for the more demonstrable errors of transporting people without identity documents or without a visa where they were required to have one. The 1987 Act was later repealed and replaced by provisions within the 1999 Act. Between its implementation and 1991 approximately £30m in fines were imposed. The numbers of \\"designated\\" ports, i.e.: those licensed to allow international passengers rose in 1987 to include Leeds/Bradford Airport, Newcastle and Edinburgh and a new terminal opened at Gatwick in 1988. The fall of the Berlin Wall brought with it a new political landscape, opened up travel routes long closed and meant the re-emergence of nationalities which had been submerged within the Soviet bloc. The relaxation of travel restrictions raised concerns at the potential movement of labour from other countries in Eastern Europe and visa controls were applied in 1992.  1990-1997: The growth in asylum  The number of asylum seekers before 1979 is difficult to determine as no separate statistics were collated before this point. A Parliamentary answer indicated that in 1973, 34 people had been granted refugee status. The application of the 1951 Convention dealing with the treatment of refugees was still being applied, to a large extent, to those people fleeing persecution from behind the Iron Curtain. UK asylum applications 1979–2009. Numbers of new applications for asylum, (not including dependents) peaked in 2002 at 84,130 - source; Home Office, Control of Immigration and Asylum statistics, HMSO The total number of asylum applications in 1979 was 1563Home Office statistical bulletin - refugee statistics 1989 - http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110218135832/rds.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs2/hosb2290.pdf and by 1988 had risen, fairly steadily but not too dramatically, to 3998.Home Office asylum statistical bulletin 1994 - http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110218135832/rds.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs2/hosb1595.pdf In 1989 the numbers of applications rose sharply, to 11640, and by 1991 had reached 44840. The reasons for the dramatic rise are complex and have to be seen in the context of international travel patterns to other European nations.Eurostat - asylum statistics explained - http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/Asylum_statistics Only a very small proportion, 5% in 1994, of applicants were granted full refugee status.Home Office statistics 1994 - http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110218135832/rds.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs2/hosb996.pdf Of the others a larger number were granted Exceptional Leave, (later re-titled Discretionary Leave), usually on the basis that other compassionate circumstances applied such as family ties. The rates of refusal highlighted a growth in applicants whose motive was found to be economic migration rather than genuine fear of return. The reasons for the rapid increase in arrivals included increasing availability of cheaper air travel, the existence by then of community groups able to provide support on arrival, relative economic prosperity that made employment possible, the availability of Legal aid to pursue the claim and eligibility to certain benefits and accommodation. For those who might otherwise have intended to enter and work illegally the benefit of an outstanding asylum claim was the legitimacy it conferred and safety as regards arrest. The administrative processes governing asylum applications were overwhelmed and a backlog started to accumulate.Immigration and asylum stats 1994 - http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110218135832/rds.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs2/hosb1595.pdf The increased delays meant more applicants eventually found themselves eligible for concessions based on the length of time the process had taken and this, in turn, encouraged speculative applications from those who saw no future in pursuing the difficult alternatives offered of seeking permission to remain through legitimate settlement or approved employment. As numbers rose, a decreasing proportion were found to qualify for refugee status. In 1980, in the United Kingdom, 64 per cent. of claimants were recognised as refugees. In 1990, the figure was about 25 per cent. Between 1995 and 2000 the newest problem the Immigration Service faced was the growth in asylum seekers entering via the Channel Tunnel with 700 a month presenting themselves at Waterloo station. Waterloo, as an international terminal, was later replaced by the control at St Pancras station and the creation of \\"juxtaposed controls\\" agreed by the Sangatte Protocol of 1992 which was itself brought into being by the Channel Tunnel (International Arrangements) Order 1993. This allowed for control zones to be set up at each end of the tunnel; the British end at St Pancras operated by French officers and the French control zone at Coquelles staffed by UK Immigration Officers. A passenger at Coquelles was still legally in France; the international frontier was at the midpoint of the tunnel. In immigration terms a person did not enter the UK until they left the terminal at Cheriton. This brought about some complex scenarios; it was not possible to claim asylum in the UK at Coquelles but it was possible to enter the control area illegally and be treated as an illegal entrant.Home Affairs Committee - First Report 2001 - Annex 15 - https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200001/cmselect/cmhaff/163/163ap09.htm Most asylum applicants detected at ports of entry had no identifying documentation but it was not legally or physically possible to detain all those who arrived. A new team to counter the growing trend of facilitation of asylum and illegal entry at seaports, both clandestine and documentary abuse, was created at Dover in 1994. The Facilitation Support Unit (FSU) was jointly staffed by the Immigration Service and Kent Police. The unit developed expertise in bringing prosecutions against those people smuggling illegal entrants. A report to the Home Affairs Select Committee in 2001 said, \\"In 1999, the FSU investigated 299 incidents and arrested 410 persons suspected of facilitating a total of 1,803 illegal entrants/asylum claimants. In the same period, 105 trials were completed involving 120 defendants and resulting in 106 convictions. Custodial sentences exceeding 172 years were imposed\\".Home Affairs Committee report 2001 - Annex 22 - work of FSU Dover 1999 - https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200001/cmselect/cmhaff/163/163ap13.htm The efforts made to identify and document the arriving asylum seekers were vital to the end of the process where an application was refused. Without proof of identity, nationality and inbound carrier it was very much more difficult to document and remove the person. Fingerprinting of asylum seekers was a key part of this process, and was being considered by 1991. Legal powers to fingerprint asylum seekers were finally given within the 1993 Asylum and Immigration ActRefugee Council - notes on 1993 Act - http://www.rcis.org.uk/Asylum+legislation/1993 Opponents expressed the view that this criminalised asylum seekers. In 1983 the total Immigration detention space available to the Immigration Service was approximately 180 spaces located at the major London airports. Elsewhere, other ports made use of local prison spaces. The existing facilities were designed to cater for short stay cases of people soon to be removed from the country having been refused at a port of entry. By 1987 it was recognised that the available space was inadequate and an attempt was made to address this by use of a floating detention vessel, (see above). The failure of the Earl William meant that the numbers of those who had to be released on temporary admission, (immigration bail), grew. The opening of Campsfield House Detention Centre in 1993 provided 200 extra spaces. The expansion led to a more centralised management of the detention estate whereas before the centres had largely been managed by the airports that they served. On 25 May 1995 the total number of people held in immigration detention centres was recorded as 381 with a further 508 being held in prisons under immigration powers. The pressure on the detention estate continued to grow during the 1990s. As detention usage grew so did the costs - £7.76m in 1993/4 rising to £17.8m by 1996/97. Tinsley House, which opened in 1996 at Gatwick, was the first purpose built immigration detention centre.  1997-2001: Expansion and modernisation  = Fairer, Faster, Firmer = In 1998, the new Labour administration published a white paper titled Fairer, faster and firmer - a modern approach to immigration and asylum which promised an expansion of the detention estate. The result was a flurry of Public Finance Initiatives to build centres at Oakington, (Cambridge), Yarlswood (Bedford), Dungavel, (Scotland) and a new expanded centre at Harmondsworth near Heathrow which increased the overall capacity by over 1500. Expansion brought the total capacity of immigration detention centres to approximately 2,800 by 2005. This massive expansion was driven by the need to maintain control not only of people arriving in the UK who had been refused, but also by the dramatic rise of enforcement within the UK over the period. The removal of those whose asylum claims had failed became the top priority but the job of tracing and detaining failed asylum seekers was only the beginning of an often tortuous process of dealing with many barriers to their removal. These included renewed applications, resurrected appeals, judicial review, MPs representations, applications to stay on the basis of marriage, human rights appeals on the basis of family ties and the problems associated with obtaining travel documentation that would actually allow the removal to take place. Maintaining control of the person during this process was seen as essential to successfully enforcing immigration removals for adults. The announcement in 1998 that IND had published its instructions on the internet was a tangible sign that the organisation was looking to the future possibilities offered by the IT revolution and was set for modernisation. The document \\"Fairer, faster, firmer\\" outlined what it considered to be the failings of the previous decade and set out its ideas for the future. One of the major successes of recent times had been the establishment by the Immigration Service of a team of Airline Liaison Officers whose job was to stop inadmissible passengers at their point of departure abroad. The first of these had been posted to New Delhi as long before as 1993 and quickly established good links with local police and immigration officials. There were some notable successes and, although undocumented arrivals had risen by 17% the previous year, this was not the case where the ALO's were deployed. In 1998 ALO's in five locations, working under a code of conduct ratified by the Air Transport Association Control Authority Working Group, prevented 2095 passengers travelling with suspect documentation. In 1999, 4999 inadmissible passenger were identified in 17 locations.Home Affairs Committee First Report - 2001 - Annex 15 - https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200001/cmselect/cmhaff/163/163ap14.htm By 2001, 57 ALO's had been deployed abroad. Another key change was a reappraisal of how and when people should be notified of their permission to enter the UK. This work was conducted under the banner “flexibility” and reconsidered how it was best to give people permission to enter, whether it was still necessary in all cases and whether permission could be granted as part of the visa process abroad. This was part of a move to modernise working processes at ports which had barely changed in their basics since 1962. The general aims, as reported to the Home Affairs Select Committee, were to speed up passenger flows and to make better use of data supplied by carriers to identify facilitators and racketeers.Home Affairs Committee report 2001- annex 12 - 1999 Flexibile Control Arrangements - https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200001/cmselect/cmhaff/163/163ap07.htm Flexibility was contained in the Immigration (Leave to Enter and Remain) Order 2000 and came into effect 30 July 2000. It paved the way for: *advance clearance to enter the UK for low risk groups such as tour parties *permission to enter to be given in writing, by fax, electronically or orally *permission to be given through a third party rather than directly * for the control can be operated abroad *capacity to keep pace with new developments such as identification by use of biometrics. There were moves to set up a more joined up intelligence network, based on the police's National Intelligence Model, whose intention was to ensure \\" that information is fully researched, developed and analysed to provide intelligence which enables senior managers to provide strategic direction, make tactical resourcing decisions about operational matters and manage risk\\".Home Affairs Committee 5th Report - July 2006 - supplementary memo 15 - https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmselect/cmhaff/775/775awe17.htm It was planned to expand the use of fingerprinting and, for enforcement, there was a major change of direction with ambitious plans to train immigration officers to make use of their powers of arrest, give them more powers of search and make them less reliant on police resources. These were just a few items on a lengthy programme of changes, backed up by substantial promises of money and legislative time in Parliament. The document was a serious statement of intent and bore the hallmarks of a small organisation evolving into a larger and very much more professional organisation but, at its heart, was a central IT project that was intended to be the hub of all the administration of casework within the Croydon HQ. = IND Casework Programme = In 1995 IND entered into an agreement with an IT consortium to develop a new computer system. The IND casework programme was a Private Finance Initiative, (PFI) agreed between IND and an IT consortium led by Siemens Business Services signed in 1996 and scheduled for completion in 1998. It was a well meant but ultimately over ambitious venture intended to provide the department with a “paperless” office where cases, especially asylum cases, would be electronically prioritised and actioned without the old fashioned processes involving transport and storage of thousands of paper based files. The delivery of the IT system in 1998 was delayed but there was an interim rollout of a computer network in readiness and the old caseworking teams were disbanded. These included the various teams such as those dealing with deportation of foreign national criminals and the teams which had provided support to the Immigration Service at ports and in enforcement. The assumption behind the programme was that these specialisms would be absorbed within the new multi-skilled teams. The reorganisation which started in December 1998 had an immediate impact in that the system ground to halt. Urgent steps were taken to restore some kind of service but the infrastructure that had previously supported the thousands of enquiries, the requests for return of passports for travel, the MPs representations, enquiries from Courts, Prisons and legal representatives, the review procedures that allowed the Immigration Service to continue with removals – had all been seriously damaged or destroyed. Efforts were made to repair the damage against the expectation that all would be well once the promised IT system was actually rolled out. In early 2001, as reported by Computer Weekly at the time, Siemens conceded that they were unable to deliver the IT system that was supposed to form the heart of the process. The impact on IND of dismantling its administrative machine and losing experienced staff while dealing with a continuing rise in workload was catastrophic. = Home Affairs Committee report of January 2001 = Source:Home Affairs Select Committee report of January 2001 - https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200001/cmselect/cmhaff/163/16302.htm By 2000, the height of IND's administrative crisis coincided with a new peak in asylum claims of 76,040. In February 2000 the Parliamentary Home Affairs Select Committee, (HAC), started a wide-ranging enquiry into the reasons for the rise in asylum and the way that IND and the Immigration Service had handled the issues. During the course of collating evidence for the enquiry the HAC visited the Red Cross centre at Sangatte near Calais and saw for themselves the numbers of would-be refugees waiting to try and enter the UK clandestinely. The issues were pushed higher up the political agenda by an awful tragedy that took place on 19 June that year when 58 Chinese people were found dead in the back of a sealed lorry at Dover. The Dutch driver was later charged with manslaughter. The deaths of the Chinese people at Dover brought about a new focus on the fact that the trafficking of people was now more than the exploitation of displaced people by opportunistic individuals it was the now (in this instance Triad based) organised crime. The HAC discussed what they described as the \\"pull factor\\", what it was that made Britain an attractive destination relative to other countries and what might be done to reduce this. Another event in February 2000 also raised the political profile of asylum seekers. A group of nine Afghan nationals hijacked an aircraft and forced it to fly to Stansted Airport. They and 79 of the passengers claimed asylum. The Afghan hijackers case was to become a political headache that highlighted the lack of powers the Home Office actually had. The then–Home Secretary, Jack Straw, promised tough action but, a court ruled in 2004 that, under Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, they could not be sent back to Afghanistan because their lives would be endangered. By 2006 the hijackers eventually won both their release and permission to stay in the UK. The ruling that allowed the hijackers to stay was described by the Prime Minister as an \\"abuse of common sense\\", and the Home Secretary blamed it on misinterpretation the Human Rights Act 1998 which had come into force in 2000. The Joint Committee on Human Rights defended the decision and was itself critical of ministers' comments.Joint Committee on Human Rights 32nd report, 2006, - https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt200506/jtselect/jtrights/278/27805.htm The HAC report noted the underlying issues of staffing within Immigration Service operational areas between 1995 and 2000 where numbers had been frozen or reduced. The HAC welcomed the plans to expand staff numbers. In fact, numbers were set to rise rapidly as new money was allocated. IND having reduced staff in the 1990s, quickly recruited 850 new staff and between 1997 and 2003 staff in IND would rise from 5000 to 11,000 The HAC was informed that on 1 July 2000 there were 2,567 staff in post in IS Ports Directorate and that this figure was due to increase to 3,050 by 31 March 2001.Home Affairs Committee - First Report 2001 - Appendix 2 - https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200001/cmselect/cmhaff/163/163ap31.htm The report saw an overarching need to join up the threads of law enforcement and recommended that people-smuggling should be treated as per any other area of organised crime and that the Immigration Service should develop joint intelligence cells to enable it to liaise more effectively with other law enforcement agencies. It noted as well that the controls on movement across Europe were only as strong as the weakest point within the member states and that 61% of forgeries were European documents. Of the greatest long term significance was recommendation 14 to create a single border agency: “We recommend that existing border control agencies should be combined into a single frontier force on the basis of secondment and direct employment, but with clear lines of communication back to the parent agencies. Pending the creation of a single frontier force, strategic co-direction of better joint working should be provided by a ministerial group to which the official Border Agencies Directors Group should report at least four times a year”. = Intelligence-led controls and organised crime = A new emphasis was emerging around the professional management of intelligence and the recognition that racketeering, facilitation and identity fraud were now big business rather than a back-street industry. Statistics for the later 1990s showed that the most commonly forged documents encountered at UK ports were EU documents. A report to the Home Affairs Committee by the IND Intelligence Section, (INDIS), noted that there was a general consensus among European law enforcement agencies that provision of such documents was being conducted on a commercial level and that, “the gangs have transferred the knowledge, facilities and networks used for smuggling drugs and other commodities to a highly profitable new endeavour. Many actively recruit potential immigrants in source countries, provide escorts and safe houses en route and are increasingly providing support on arrival such as legal advice to lodge asylum applications. Opportunist illegal entry is becoming rarer. The trade is now firmly in the hands of organised crime”.Home Affairs Committee - First Report 2001 - Appendix 15 - https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200001/cmselect/cmhaff/163/163ap12.htm INDIS believed that the documents were targeted at the points of the immigration control that were perceived as weakest – in this case the British and European Union channels. This created a conflict with the idea of flexibility at the controls which sought to move passengers quickly. How this might have been resolved is now immaterial because outside events provided a new focus on the security of border controls with the attack on the World Trade Center in New York on 11 September 2001. The future emphasis was to be very much more stringent at the point where the traveller came into contact with border controls but the new thinking did have the effect of moving some of the consideration away from the airport queues. The reappraisal of the UK's security needs in the wake of 9/11 would ultimately lead to the creation of the Serious Organised Crime Agency. The Service's primary investigative capability was created in 1999 as the Criminal Investigations Section (CIS). The CIS were charged with the investigation and prosecution of criminal offences borne out of abuse of immigration legislation. Focussing on marriage abuse, the CIS soon expanded into human trafficking and forgery & counterfeiting investigations. The CIS led the Service's investigation into the Yarlswood Detention Centre riots in 2001 and over a number of months was responsible for re-detaining almost all escapees. In 2003 the CIS was disbanded and reformed as the London Command Crime Group (LCCG) and moved from its central London offices to a new HQ in Croydon. Staffed by experienced UKIS investigators, former police officers, former HM Customs Officers and former Benefits Agency investigators, the 18-strong unit (1 HM Inspector, 3 Chief Immigration Officers and 14 Immigration Officers) was granted a number of additional powers traditionally reserved for police. Better liaison and better intelligence started to bring rewards - Operation Gular disrupted a network responsible for smuggling over 400 people into the UK over a two-year period. Five men were sentenced to a total of 20 years as a result of closer working with the French authorities.Controlling Our Borders - White paper - 2005 - http://www.archive2.official-documents.co.uk/document/cm64/6472/6472.pdf  2002-2005: Asylum starts to wane and Tipping the Balance  = Secure Borders, Safe Haven = In 2002 Immigrations Service Ports Directorate achieved its highest number of refusals at the border ever, 50,362 as compared with 17,220 refusals at port in 1994. The gradual impact of more visas being issued abroad and the greater emphasis on screening people pre-entry reduced the figure, as did the general fall in non-EEA passenger from its peak in 2000. By 2004, 31,930 passengers were refused entry at port and subsequently removed and, in 2010 the figure had markedly fallen to 18,276.Home Affairs Committee, 5th report 2006 - https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmselect/cmhaff/775/77507.htm#a29HO Control of Immigration Statistics 2011 In February 2002 the government published the white paper Secure Borders, Safe Haven.Home Office (2002a), Secure Borders, Safe Haven: Integration with Diversity in Modern Britain CM5387. London: The Stationery Office In many ways this was a continuation of the modernisation policies set out in its predecessor Fairer, Firmer, Faster in that it outlined plans for more electronic mechanisation of the controls such as iris recognition, heartbeat sensors, backscatter X-ray and gamma ray scanners which would be used at Dover and Coquelles to spot hidden illegal entrants. The new technology would be used, to speed through frequent travellers so that resources were better targeted at those more likely to present a problem. The document went beyond the creation of new technologies though and has to be seen in the context of its time. Numbers of new asylum seekers peaked in 2002 at 84,130, (the highest it would reach), keeping the issue of asylum firmly at the top of the political agenda. It was a document that highlighted the changes in thinking and social attitudes that had taken place since the 1950s and 1960s when the background social policy assumptions had centred on the concept of assimilation. That idea had been replaced by multiculturalism and social cohesion. The document set out ideas as to how the difficult balance could be struck between controlling migration, promoting cultural acceptance, combating social exclusion and promoting a cohesive, modern sense of what it meant to be British. The document advocated a policy of “managed immigration” to allow more people to enter the UK legally, (especially for work), and tougher mechanisms and rules to prevent those working illegally. It linked immigration policy to an oft repeated assertion that migration provided a positive resource for the economy. The white paper said, “Migration is an inevitable reality of the modern world and it brings significant benefits. But to ensure that we sustain the positive contribution of migration to our social well-being and economic prosperity, we need to manage it properly and build firmer foundations on which integration with diversity can be achieved”, and; “The Government will initiate and open and constructive debate about citizenship, civic identity and shared values”. The practical intention was to seek to drive asylum applications down by a carrot and stick approach. The \\"pull\\" factors which encouraged asylum seekers to come to Britain would be reduced, (by, for instance, removing access to support for destitute asylum seekers who did not claim asylum immediately upon arrival), and an incentive to follow the mainstream immigration route would be encouraged by relaxing the rules on those coming to work. This would test the assumption that most asylum applicants were actually economic migrants and that by freeing up the legal labour market it would take the heat away from the asylum pressure-cooker. The rules on young people coming for “working holidays” were to be relaxed and a new, “Seasonal Agricultural Workers Scheme” introduced which would be extended across the economy with set quotas for industries short of labour. Under the scheme a worker could stay up to six months but would have no right to bring dependants. The work permit scheme would be extended to those with medium skills from outside the EU coming for a specific job. Permit holders would be able to apply to stay in Britain after four years. The changes were introduced by the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. The most controversial area was that of cutting off support to asylum seekers. The Refugee Council said that the law would “\\"potentially affect the lives and wellbeing of thousands of asylum applicants in the UK forcing them into extreme poverty and making it more difficult to pursue their asylum application\\". This aspect of the law was challenged and, in 2004, the European Court held that it breached Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights and the policy was dropped.BBC report 2004 - IND loses ECHR case on asylum benefits - http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3735203.stm Despite these future setbacks the numbers of asylum seekers started to fall. This was brought about by many factors, the better casework processes, faster removal rates, new appeal regulations and other factors such as the 33,000 people who were denied boarding in 2003 by Airline Liaison Officers abroad.Controlling Our Borders - white paper - 2005 - http://www.archive2.official-documents.co.uk/document/cm64/6472/6472.pdf During the 1990s the Airline Liaison Officers had been an essential component in preventing undocumented passengers reaching the UK and driving down asylum claims, (see previous sections). The impact was significant - numbers of Inadequately Documented Arrivals (IDAs) detected after arriving by air fell from 14,071 in 2003 to 6,831 in 2005.Home Affairs Committee 5th report 2006 - https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmselect/cmhaff/775/77507.htm#a29 This though was only one of the measures taken to regain control of the border together with more casework and enforcement staff, restricted public benefits, improved casework processes and streamlined appeals procedures. The ALO network underlined the benefits of driving down the routes which organised criminal facilitators could exploit and more thought and effort went into refining these ideas and tightening the control. New IT support tools were introduced including:: *Heartbeat technology - special sensors to detect and analyse clandestine movements within freight vehicles via the vehicle chassis and superstructure, *X/Gamma ray scanners and carbon dioxide sensors used to detect the exhaled breath of clandestine entrants in the trailers of vehicles. In 2003, 3,482 clandestine entrants had been detected at the on-entry controls; in 2005 this had been reduced to 1,588. More effort was directed into de-briefing new asylum seekers during initial screening to gather intelligence about the facilitators and routes used. In 2005 Iris screening underwent live testing at ports for the first time.Home Affairs Committee 2006 - Border technology - https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmselect/cmhaff/775/775awe19.htm The downward trajectory was steep enough to prompt the Prime Minister Tony Blair when speaking at the 2004 Labour Party Conference to set a target for IND and the Immigration Service that, by 2006, the numbers of failed asylum seekers removed from the UK would exceed the numbers of new applications. This became known as the “Tipping The Balance” target and the work to meet the target became the organisation's top priority. = Development of child protection = The role of immigration staff in child protection was already long recognised as a high priority by the Immigration Service at ports and during enforcement operations where, for foreign children coming to the UK, they might be the only government officials with whom they come into contact. Although mechanisms already existed to work with police and social services a new initiative was launched in 2003. The Metropolitan Police and Immigration Service, together with other government welfare agencies and the NSPCC, piloted an operation known as \\"Operation Paladin Child\\" to monitor the arrival of unaccompanied children at Heathrow Airport. Social services were asked to undertake assessments of any child meeting certain criteria. The operation, as well as addressing an important issue, had the wider benefit of building an understanding between social workers and law enforcement officers of each other's needs. Between August and November 2003, 1,738 unaccompanied children arrived from non-EU countries. Most of these were travelling legitimately for education or holidays but a small number of children gave 'grave cause for concern' and police were subsequently unable to locate 12 of the children.Home Affairs Committee 5th report 2006 - Children - https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmselect/cmhaff/775/77509.htm#a42 IS at Heathrow Airport led the way in the UK in setting up sensitive and sophisticated reception arrangements for children and developed facilities and training to identify children at risk. A programme of specialist training for immigration officers in dealing with children at risk resulted in 495 immigration officers being trained in interviewing children by 2006.Home Affairs Committee 5th report 2006 - https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmselect/cmhaff/775/775awe48.htm = EU accession and ministerial resignation = 2004 saw the arrival of ten new countries into the EU, Cyprus, Malta, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia. The government predicted that 15,000 new workers would arrive in the UK but, by 2006 around 430,000 had registered for work and this rose to 683,000 by 2007, 70% of which were from Poland. The history of Polish migration to the United Kingdom gives an indicator of why Poles predominated so much. A large number of Polish citizens had been allowed to settle after World War 2 in a resettlement programme for those who had no wish to live under the new Communist Polish regime, (see earlier section). The possibility that numbers might cause alarm seems to have been acknowledged by the Home Office who fast tracked visa applications in Romania and Bulgaria between 2002 and 2004. A later Home Office investigation showed that junior staff had taken short cuts to clear a back-log.BBC 2004 - EU accession - http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3813903.stmBBC - Bulgarian visa scandal - http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3589617.stm The National Audit Office expressed concern at the lack of checks that had been conducted and the Home Secretary admitted that the system had been “insufficiently robust”. It transpired that warnings had been given by the visa issuing post in Sofia that checks on applications were being waived in London against their wishes.BBC - Bulgarian visa scandal - http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3582523.stm The Immigration Minister Bev Hughes told the BBC and the House of Commons that she had been unaware of the allegations but later confirmed that she, or her office, had been notified of the problems 18 months before and that she had inadvertently misled the House. Having grossly underestimated the numbers for the first eight countries there was concern about allowing unlimited access to Romania and Bulgaria when they joined. A particularly unexpected aspect of those coming was the impact on child benefit payments with 68,000 new applications. Restrictions were placed on Romanian and Bulgarian citizens when they joined in 2007 which slowed their flow into the job market.BBC - Romanian and Bulgarian EU accession - http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/5273356.stmBBC - Bulgarian and Romanian EU accession - http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6957171.stm Concerns among some government agencies about benefit fraud by EEA citizens and concerns within the National Health Service (NHS) about illicit \\"health tourism\\" by foreign nationals meant that closer working and \\"joined up\\" government became newly fashionable concepts; but the constraints of the Data Protection Act and the nervousness of government agencies in identifying foreign nationals meant that progress in tackling identity fraud would be slow. The impact for the Immigration Service was not so much the new arrivals as the opportunities that their national documents presented for fraud. A growing number of migrants from neighbouring countries used fraudulently obtained “accession” documents as a means of entering the UK. The wider impact on IND and the Home Office was to undermine the positive work that had been achieved in restoring its reputation in the wake of the asylum crisis and once again damage its credibility and operational integrity. = One Step Ahead and dealing with organised crime = The 2004 white paper “One Step Ahead - A 21st Century Strategy to Defeat Organised Crime” set out, among other things the role and responsibilities of the new Serious Organised Crime Agency in tackling organised crime. The paper made it clear that it was intended that the various agencies already working together on these issues would do so ever more closely but that there was no need to create a new border agency. :“In light of the creation of the Serious Organised Crime Agency and the opportunity for that new body to establish close working partnerships with the existing border agencies, it is not proposed to create a single border agency” The agency, SOCA, would be a “non-departmental public body”. Rather ambiguously, the paper said that although the Home Secretary would be “accountable to parliament for the agencies performance”... “The Agency will enjoy full operational independence from Ministers”. The arms length relationship that agencies’ provided clearly had attractions and may have provided a model for the future of IND.  Controlling Our Borders: the 2005 five-year plan  The high level thinking around security and intelligence meant that, even without the July 7th terrorist bombings that year, there was a new appetite for greater cooperation and better use of data. The 2005 white paper “Controlling Our Borders - Making Migration Work for Britain” outlined the new “e-Borders” programme; :“a joined up modernised intelligence-led border control and security framework” to “allow Immigration Service and other agencies including Police, Customs and Excise, Security Services to work more closely together”. It went on to explain how this would be achieved; :“The e-Borders systems will collect both arrivals and departure information … Carriers will provide advance passenger information (API) and passenger name records (PNR) electronically. Passenger details (including names, dates of birth, nationality and travel document details) will be checked against multi- agency watchlists prior to boarding a flight….we will have a much clearer picture of passengers’ movements in and out of the country. This wealth of information will help border control, law enforcement and intelligence agencies, and other Government departments to target their activity”.Home Office Libaray research paper 2006 - http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons/lib/research/rp2007/rp07-011.pdfControlling Our Borders - white paper 2005 - http://www.archive2.official- documents.co.uk/document/cm61/6167/6167.pdf This was a hugely ambitious project to join up various agencies and use both public and private data, both inside and outside the UK, in ways that had never been attempted before. It had already started in 2004 as Project Semaphore which was to test the principles in a limited way and act as a proof of concept for the full implementation of e-Borders. Semaphore went beyond the theoretical though – it would actually start producing data on routes of interest.Home Affairs Committee report - e-Borders - https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmselect/cmhaff/170/17002.htm “Controlling our Borders” also outlined two other planks that were to underpin future strategy. The Points Based System for issuing visas would not become reality until 2007 but was already in planning. More immediate was the “New Asylum Model”, (NAM), for dealing with asylum applications. This was a combination of existing fast track processes, which would be extended, and another attempt at single owner caseworking whose aim was to ensure continuity through the entire decision making process. Caseworkers would be expected to perform a far wider range of duties including the presentation of case at appeal hearings and the casework surrounding a person's removal. The new casework teams would be the machine that would track and manage failed asylum seekers towards removal as a “ready to go product” in much the manner championed by the Home Affairs Committee.Home Affairs Committee - enforcement and removals - tracking of applicants - https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmselect/cmhaff/775/77511.htm#a70  2007-2008: Border and Immigration Agency to UK Border Agency  The events of 2006 involving the foreign prisoners crisis prompted a \\"re-branding\\" exercise combined with the move to turn IND into an executive agency. Since 1999 a great deal of legislative time, resources and development capital had been allocated to immigration issues. The mistakes that led to the resignation of Beverley Hughes and Charles Clarke led to consideration of whether more fundamental change was required. The Border and Immigration Agency was created on 1 April 2007. This was not the unified border force that had been recommended by the Home Affairs Committee in 2001. The creation of the new agency took place in the wake of the, still toxic, Foreign National Prisoners scandal. The publicly stated benefits were that the agency would be more accountable. The key organisational change was that of regionalisation. The new agency would be divided into six new regions each under the command of a Director. Border staff would not be regionalised owing the fact that their workforce was inextricably tethered to ports in London and the South East. The Immigration Service Ports Directorate would, for the first time, be uniformed. The case for regionalisation was set out on the basis that local teams would form closer links with other regional government offices and with local communities. The Unions suspected another motive of creating an environment where national pay scales would be ended in favour of local rates. The practical argument for regionalisation appeared to undermined by the fact that most migrants lived in the South East. The fate of Immigration Service enforcement staff was less clear cut. They already had a regional structure but the directorate was again be disbanded and reorganised along a new regional structure. The central management structures for enforcement were disbanded and their functions dispersed. As the new agency was created so the Immigration Service ceased to exist but their functions continued under a new umbrella organisation called the Border and Immigration Agency. On 1 July the Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, announced that he was going to:“reform the UK’s border arrangements, integrating the work of Customs, the Border and Immigration Agency and UKvisas, overseas and at the main points of entry to the UK, and establishing a unified border force”. The Cabinet Office quickly published a “review” document “Security in a Global Hub - Establishing the UK’s new border arrangements”.  2010-present: Home Office hostile environment policy  References Immigration law in the United Kingdom Immigration to the United Kingdom History of immigration to the United Kingdom ","title":"History of UK immigration control"},{"id":"46472162","text":"Rêve En Vert is an online luxury boutique focusing on high-end sustainable products.

St. Petersburg and Hamburg  Natascha Artin Brunswick was the daughter of , a Russian Jewish economist from Kharkiv. Her mother was a Russian orthodox aristocrat and dentist. Since at the time Russian orthodox Christians were prohibited from marrying Jews, she converted to Protestantism. They were married in Finland. Naum Jasny was an adherent of the Mensheviks and fled to Tbilisi after the October Revolution in 1917. Natascha, her sister, and her mother followed in 1920. After the Bolsheviks took control of Georgia, the family lived in Austria from 1922 to 1924, for a brief period in 1924 in Berlin, and finally moved to Langenhorn, Hamburg, where they remained until 1937. Natascha Jasny attended the progressive Lichtwark school. While still in school, she photographed with a simple box camera and processed her own pictures in the bathroom at home, which served as a makeshift darkroom. Natascha graduated in 1928. She hoped to study architecture at the Bauhaus Dessau, but the family's financial situation made this impossible. She instead studied mathematics at the University of Hamburg, where she also took courses in art history from Aby Warburg and Erwin Panofsky. She graduated from the university in 1930 with a Magister degree. On August 29, 1929 she married her mathematics professor Emil Artin, who had been teaching in Hamburg since 1923. In 1933, the Artins had a daughter, Karin, and in 1934 a son, Michael. Because his wife was half Jewish, Emil Artin was forced into early retirement from his teaching position under the Nazi Party Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service. On September 27, 1934, Artin already had to sign a declaration that his wife was not \\"Aryan\\". The Artin family managed to leave Germany for the United States on October 21, 1937. Since they were prohibited from taking larger sums of money with them, the Artins shipped their entire household, which reflected their modernist sensibilities.  Life in the United States  Natascha's husband first obtained a teaching position at the University of Notre Dame, and in 1938 moved to Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana. The Artins had their third child, son Thomas (Tom), in 1938. During World War II, Natascha Artin was classified an enemy alien. The United States Army nevertheless hired her in 1942 to teach Russian to soldiers under Army Specialized Training Program at Indiana University. In 1946, Emil was hired by Princeton University, and the Artins moved to Princeton, New Jersey. They divorced in 1958, after which Emil Artin returned to Hamburg. Natasha Artin remarried in 1960. Her second husband was composer Mark Brunswick. Artin Brunswick returned to Hamburg as an official guest of the City of Hamburg in 1998, on the occasion of Emil Artin's 100th birthday. She lived in Princeton until her death in 2003.  Work as a mathematician  After her move to Princeton, Natascha Artin joined the group around Richard Courant at the mathematics department of New York University. She became the technical editor of the journal Communications on Pure and Applied Mathematics, founded at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences in 1948, and in 1956 became the primary translation editor for the journal Theory of Probability and Its Applications, a position she held until 1989. In recognition of her long-standing membership of over 50 years, she was made an Honorary Member of the American Mathematical Society.  Work as photographer  Artin Brunswick never saw herself as a professional photographer. She considered it a \\"private passion, nevertheless, it was a bit more than just taking snapshots.\\" After they married in 1929, Emil Artin, who shared her passion for photography, gave her a Leica compact camera. She was encouraged in her photography by the painter Heinrich Stegemann, a family friend. She first took pictures of family members, friends, and landscapes, but later explored Hamburg and photographed scenes such as the Port of Hamburg, the Jungfernstieg, and the main railway station. She was particularly interested in architecture, and, influenced by the ideas of the Bauhaus, preferred clear, bright lines in her photographs. As she was classified an enemy alien during World War II, her camera was provisionally confiscated by police in 1942. By the time it was returned to her, she had lost her passion for photography. Her prints from the time in Hamburg, however, survived through her emigration. Her son Tom rediscovered them about forty years later in a cabinet. He recognized their importance and contacted galleries in Hamburg. Artin Brunswick's photographs were first shown at the Kunstgenuss gallery in Hamburg-Eppendorf in 1999. In 2001, the Museum für Kunst und Gewerbe organized an exhibition of 227 original prints under the title Hamburg, As I Saw It. Photographs from the 1920s and 30s. Despite her advanced age of 91 years, Natascha Brunswick took the trip from New York to attend the opening. The museum now holds 230 original prints; the negatives are in the possession of the Artin family.

History The group was founded in early 1998 by Antonio López, Alejandro Méndez, Julián Méndez and Alfredo Núñez. After several Demos like, \\"Las cinco Ventanas\\" and \\"El Viaje de Estudios de mis Neuronas\\" they signed their first record deal with DJ Valdi and Houston Party Records in early 2004. In February of that same year they recorded their first work \\"Viaje de Estudios\\" in the ADJ Shelter with producer Mac McCaughan, singer Superchunk, going on sale in May 2004. This first album was very well received by media as Radio 3 and indie press making Ojo Critico a RNE program offer the Modern Music Prize the same year. In June 2005 they recorded their second album Hostal Pimodan at Odds Studio in El Puerto de Santa María with Thom Monahan as producer. This album releases in October 2005 in a climate of disagreements with his record company. This situation ends in a few months with the break between Lori Meyers and Houston Party and as a consequence, they sign by the multinational Universal Music. During this period the group expands to five components as Sergio Martín is incorporated in the work of guitar, keyboards and bass. In April 2006 Hostal Pimodan reissued with a dual format with the cover which the band originally wanted. In late 2006 Julian Mendez left the band and re-formed into quartet, Sergio Martin on bass and vocals.

With the background of President Kennedy's assassination, Harry has decided to totally replace his unhappy life with a more successful one, by using a method he devised for winning money at blackjack. He grows a beard, learns of an identity which he can adopt without harming anyone, and slowly builds up his escape which will be under the false identity, and will include a false suicide, ridding him of his real identity, and leaving no one in pursuit of him, with all his potential adversaries including his wife, receiving ample compensation and no hard feelings against him. Harry's plot is accomplished with the paid assistance of Herbie who slowly discovers and comprehends what his employer's plans are, while confronting his own unlucky life, bad divorce and bad job, which he seems to be stuck in. Amy, a beautiful woman (Linda Evans) falls in love with Harry, and towards the end of the movie, as he is completing his escape, he decides to change his flight destination to Israel coinciding with Amy's.

Most recently, this occurred between February and May 2014, when protests over Christine Lagarde’s invitation allegedly forced her to rescind her acceptance to give the commencement speech for the class of 2014 at their graduation. While it is said that “such reversals have become more common in recent years” given that, “what has changed is not so much the protests themselves, but the willingness of colleges and speakers to give in”, there is actually a longer history of controversy over the chosen commencement speaker that spans back to the 1960s if not before. What Smith’s history shows is that the struggle over representation, as demonstrated by the controversy over commencement speakers in many colleges, is not a new occurrence, but rather an old stage for a struggle over an institution’s values and those that the institution represents. 1967, Nicholas Katzenbach In 1967, the then-President Thomas C. Mendenhall invited Nicholas Katzenbach to be the commencement speaker for the graduating class. At the time, he was the 24th Undersecretary of State under Lyndon Johnson. When it was announced that he was to give the commencement speech, he was roundly criticized for his stance on the Vietnam War. The senior class petitioned, stating: “We are honored by the presence of Nicholas B. Katzenbach as our commencement speaker. We respect and admire his past work in the fields of civil rights and crime prevention. However, in his post as Under Secretary of State, he is clearly a representative of America’s present foreign policy. Therefore, we the undersigned graduating seniors of Smith College take this opportunity to express our opposition to our government’s responsibility for widening the conflict in Vietnam.” At their own commencement, members of the graduating class wore white armbands to express their disagreement with the foreign policy of the United States. Many faculty members also made their opposition to the Vietnam War clear by providing every commencement pamphlet with a petition. The petition quotes: “Our hopes are that the U.S. Government, by means of an extraordinary conciliatory gesture, will seek a way of bringing peace to our country and to the world.” Nicholas Katzenbach delivered the speech on the 4th of June, 1967, titled, “How Can You Be So Sure?” amidst all parents, faculty, staff and students. After his speech, President Mendenhall held a conference where Katzenbach expressed the policies of the U.S. in regards to the Vietnam War more specifically. The Alumnae Quarterly of the Summer of 1967 reflected on both methods of protest as “dignified” and hailed the president for handling the situation so well. 1970, Dr. Alan F. Guttmacher While there was not as much controversy in 1970 over the choice of Alan Frank Guttmacher, the president of Planned Parenthood, the backlash from parents and Alumnae represent their powerful force in an institution that no longer represents them directly. 1970 was also the year that President Richard Nixon's daughter graduated from Smith College. He could not attend the event because his policies were not widely accepted and to avoid the possibility of protests at what was a considered a non-political event. Many parents and Alumnae wrote to the president, Thomas Mendenhall, declaring their dissatisfaction with the commencement speaker choice and lamenting how the President of The United States, nor his daughter, could be present at her own graduation. In a letter to the editor of the Daily Hampshire Gazette, the author stated: “If the present Administration and Trustees feel [they] cannot handle the troublemakers on Campus, then quietly resign and I’m sure you will have some others who will be quite capable of handling the situations as they arise and will not cop-out.” Many were upset that the president of Planned Parenthood, an organization that they say promoted pre-marital sex, could speak in front of the Smith Community while the President of The United States “could not” attend. Dr. Alan F. Guttmacher delivered his address on graduation day, which was titled, “Fertility Control: A Gift and Challenge.” 1983, Jeane Kirkpatrick Official portrait of Jeane Kirkpatrick One of the most notable controversies of Smith College’s history of commencement was the President’s, Jill Ker Conway, and the trustees’ decision to host Jeane Kirkpatrick as the class of 1983′s speaker. After she served as a foreign policy adviser to Ronald Reagan, she was the first female U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and was known for her doctrine, The Kirkpatrick Doctrine which justified U.S. support of military dictatorships in Central and South America. Almost immediately after the announcement of their choice, students organized against it, claiming that a human rights abuser should not receive an honorary degree. A letter to the Alumnae Quarterly by Helen Haddad ’63 said: “Students began writing letters and ‘perspectives’ pieces to The Sophian, both in support of, and in opposition to, Mrs. Kirkpatrick–among them was a piece written by a senior whose aunt was one of the four Maryknoll nuns killed in El Salvador. They discussed their interpretations of Mrs. Kirkpatrick’s published books and articles. They discussed American foreign policy in Latin America, South Africa, and elsewhere. Some students who in October knew very little about Mrs. Kirkpatrick, except perhaps that she was an ambassador to the United Nations, were now arguing over her views and votes, whether or not she was an appropriate commencement speaker and whether or not they approved of the award of an honorary degree” Besides the tone which assumes Smith Students did not know of these issues before Kirkpatrick was chosen, it is clear that there was much sentiment against what made her a powerful woman within the U.S. government. This incited a discussion on the kind of feminism that Smith represents, being an all women’s liberal arts college. When Kirkpatrick canceled her commencement speech and eventually declined the honorary degree, alumnae, students, parents, and the media took hold of the story and framed it as a freedom of speech issue that was plaguing College Campuses. 2014, Christine Lagarde Portrait of Christine Lagarde The frame that many media outlets used to situate the Kirkpatrick controversy at Smith was used again in 2014 in regards to Christine Lagarde’s decision to withdraw her acceptance to speak at graduation. Christine Lagarde, the first female Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund, sparked numerous protests, petitions, and discussions. Parallels were drawn with Smith’s current campaign, that states its mission as educating powerful woman for the benefit of the world. Whether or not Christine Lagarde benefited the world with her high-status position was the contested question. In the wake of the protests, she rescinded her acceptance to speak at Smith College’s commencement ceremony. The response to her withdrawal was immense. Numerous articles appeared in major media outlets. Many alumnae wrote to the President, Kathleen McCartney, and faculty petitioned against those who had petitioned in support of McCartney and the Trustees. Students who had organized against the choice of having her speak wrote an open letter to McCartney after she emailed the entire College, stating: “I want to underscore this fact: An invitation to speak at a commencement is not an endorsement of all views or policies of an individual or the institution she or he leads. Such a test would preclude virtually anyone in public office or position of influence. Moreover, such a test would seem anathema to our core values of free thought and diversity of opinion. I remain committed to leading a college where differing views can be heard and debated with respect.” See also * \\"After Protests, I.M.F Chief Withdraws as Smith College's Commencement Speaker\\", New York Times *\\"The Commencement Controversy\\", New York Times * \\"Everything is political these days.

Mercy is the fifth largest Catholic health care system in the United States and named one of the top five large U.S. health systems in 2018 by Truven. Mercy was founded in 1871 by Sisters of Mercy as part of the communal support and developed as part of their mission. Currently Mercy has 45 acute care and specialty (heart, children's orthopedic and rehab) hospitals. Mercy employs 44,000 employees and more than 2,100 physicians.  History  The mission of Mercy comes from the teachings of Catherine McAuley, an Irish nun who founded Sisters of Mercy in 1831. Mercy in the United States traces its roots to New York in 1846. In 1856 the Sisters of Mercy came to St. Louis and founded the Religious Sisters of Mercy of the St. Louis Province. Fifteen years later, in 1871, they opened a 25-bed infirmary for women and children. Over the years, the Sisters of Mercy expanded their health ministry in the Regional Community’s seven-state area: Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma and Texas. While the hospitals and other health care facilities sponsored by the Sisters of Mercy were not formally linked, as early as the 1960s they shared management and consulting staff resources. In 1986, to position the individual hospitals for coming changes in health care, the Sisters of Mercy created the Sisters of Mercy Health System. In 2011, Sisters of Mercy Health System renamed many of its hospitals and clinics under a singular brand - Mercy. For example, St. John's Mercy Medical Center in St. Louis is now Mercy Hospital St. Louis.  Locations  Mercy operates in four states (Missouri, Kansas, Arkansas and Oklahoma), with ministry outreach programs in Texas and Louisiana. Mercy's largest hospital complexes are in Springfield, Missouri and Greater St. Louis. St. John's Regional Medical Center St. John's Regional Medical Center after the May 22 Joplin tornado On May 22, 2011, one of Mercy's larger hospitals, St. John's Regional Medical Center (now rebuilt and called Mercy Hospital Joplin) was seriously damaged by a tornado from the May 2011 tornado outbreak. At least four people were killed inside the hospital and its grounds, and surviving patients were evacuated from the health facility, which sustained major structural damage. One of the hospital's towers took a direct hit by the storm and was rotated four inches on its foundation.  Services  Mercy offers many services in the communities it serves. Including services such as cancer treatment, pediatrics, heart and palliative care. Mercy has opened the world's first facility dedicated solely to Telemedicine. The Safewatch program was created in 2006 and has said to have served up to 420 beds remotely. Mercy hosts one of the largest implementations of Epic, an electronic health record (EHR). In 2014 Mercy began to provide Epic support services to other healthcare organizations such as CaroMont Regional Medical Center and Oklahoma State University.  Leadership  Lynn Britton has served as the CEO of Mercy since January 2009.

On May 27, 2017, in a turnout of 20.2 percent of registered voters in a special election, Price handily defeated his fellow Democrat, Warren Harang, III, 9,224 (63 percent) to 5,507 (37 percent) for the right to finish the remainder of fellow Democrat Troy E. Brown's term in the state Senate. Carter resigned in an ethical cloud earlier in the year. In 2012, Price was elected to the Louisiana House of Representatives for District 58 in Ascension, Iberville, and St. James parishes near the capital city of Baton Rouge. Background Price graduated in 1975 from the historically black Grambling State University in Grambling in Lincoln Parish in North Louisiana. He is a supervisor at Diols Manufacturing BASF Corporation. He has formerly resided in New Orleans and Darrow in Ascension Parish, dates unavailable. Political career In the November 19, 2011, runoff election in House District 58 to choose a successor to Democrat Elton M. Aubert, Price handily defeated his intra-party rival, Dwayne \\"Gully\\" Bailey, 4,816 (58.3 percent) to 3,447 (41.7 percent). Two other Democrats, Heurlin Christopher \\"Chris\\" Delpit (born August 1959) and Gail Cherise Holland (born August 1964), both also of Gonzales, were eliminated in the nonpartisan blanket primary for the House held earlier on October 22. Representative Price is vice-chairman of the Louisiana Black Caucus and is a member of the Louisiana Rural Caucus, the Acadiana delegation, and the Democratic Caucus. He serves on these committees: (1) Commerce, (2) Education, (3) Retirement, and (4) Atchafalaya Basin Program Oversight. Price's legislative ratings have ranged from 36 to 67 percent from the conservative Louisiana Association of Business and Industry. Endorsed by the AFL-CIO, Price is ranked 100 percent by the Louisiana Association of Educators. In 2013 and 2014, the conservative Louisiana Family Forum scored him 50 and 33 percent, respectively. He has been rated from 75 to 100 percent by Louisiana Right to Life though he did not vote on the 2014 requirement that abortion providers have hospital admitting privileges near their clinics; the measure passed the House, 88-5. In 2014, Price voted to extend the time for implementation of the Common Core State Standards Initiative. He did not vote on the issue of prohibiting the transportation of dogs in the bed of a pick-up truck on interstate highways. In 2013, Price voted to reduce penalties for possession of marijuana. He opposed lifetime concealed carry gun permits and objected as well to the taking of weapons into restaurants. He supported making information about permit holders a matter of public record. He opposed allowing deductions on state income tax deductions to taxpayers who contribute to scholarship funds. In 2012, he voted to prohibit the use of telephones while driving. He opposed the reduction of the number of hours that polling locations remain open. Louisiana has traditionally had 14-hour polling days. Price and Harang, a resident of Donaldsonville, led a 13-candidate field in the first round of balloting on April 29 to choose Troy Brown's successor in the state Senate. Price then defeated Harang in the second round of balloting.

Beverley. Life Nothing is known for certain of Beverley's private life, but she was travelling about the West Country by 1814, and must have been born before the end of the 18th century, even if her stage career began very early. From the date on the last extant reprint of a pamphlet of hers it can be assumed that she was still alive in 1831.Orlando project biography. Retrieved 21 April 2015. It is not known who R. Beverley was, but his wife wrote a poem on \\"my Child's being unfortunately burnt to death,\\" implying that grief at this hastened her husband's death as well.The Feminist Companion to Literature in English, eds Virginia Blain, Patricia Clements and Isobel Grundy (London: Batsford, 1990), p. 91. Writings One of Beverley's works, Modern Times (1818) was prompted by the death in childbirth of Princess Charlotte of Wales, the only child of the future King George IV, taking the form of a sermon on the text of Jeremiah 5:29, \\"Shall I not visit for these things? saith the LORD: shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?\\" Others, in verse or prose, comment on a child's death, on the value to women of male applause, and on publisher/author relations (a writer beaten down to £5 for his work later managing to obtain £200 for it by subscription). The prose Veluti in speculum (1827) consists of letters on subjects such as singing in church, managing a theatre, and the importance of elocution, addressed to \\"Mira\\". The author notes in her long subtitle that it is not intended to secure her \\"a niche in Westminster Abbey\\" (i. e. among the graves of great writers) but for the better purpose \\"of putting pence in her pocket to maintain life.\\" It was claimed that The Actress's Ways and Means, to Industriously Raise the Wind (c. 1820) had gone into 12 editions. It states that Beverley herself suffered business failure, but gained success with what were known as her \\"Dramatic Metamorphoses\\", consisting mainly of verse recitals. Elsewhere she describes herself as a teacher of elocution to \\"the Pulpit, Bar, Stage, and Drawing Room\\", but also as \\"that Odd Little Woman\\". Some of her material is repeated in different pamphlets. On Brighton Selected works The pamphlets were self-published. Many were reprinted. Data come from Orlando and the British Library catalogue.

The work is carried out by helicopter and by backpack-sprayers. Technology The German Mosquito Control Association, in German Kommunale Aktionsgemeinschaft zur Bekämpfung der Schnakenplage (KABS), is an association founded in 1976, with its seat in Speyer (Germany), by 98 bodies (towns, parishes, counties including Baden-Wuerttemberg, 2013 figure) along the upper Rhine to combat the problem of mosquitoes in the area. Of the 33 species found in the upper Rhine area over 80% are Aedes vexans. It is not uncommon to find 50 thousand Aedes eggs in a single square meter of river bank in a flood plain area. KABS employees carry out mosquito control on a 300 km stretch of the Rhine between Bingen and Offenburg over an area of around six thousand square kilometers. They exclusively use a protein produced by Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (BTI). This work is carried out, depending on the current water levels, accessibility of the terrain and statutory requirements, either on foot or by helicopter. In both cases the biologically active ingredient, which is not allowed to contain living bacteria, is applied in areas of water where the larvae breed. The agent must then be ingested by the larvae, as only then is it activated and leads to a breakup of intestinal cells, and thus extremely selectively kills the organisms.  Distribution  The active substance is mixed with water and distributed with a backpack sprayer by workers on foot, or applied as an ice granulate from the air by helicopter. In 2007, 260 tons of the agent were spread by the two available helicopters and 250 helpers, on 84 action days of which 47 were supported by helicopter. This involved 33 thousand working hours and 270 thousand kilometers travelled. At a cost of 400 thousand Euros annually the result is a reduction of the mosquito population by 99% compared to untreated areas. The time of application is critical for the efficiency of the treatment. Mosquitoes lay their eggs in hollows above the normal water level, and they are activated when flood levels are reached. Treatment must follow within a week. In addition, residents of the KABS areas are supplied with CULINEX tablets free of charge in order to treat smaller bodies of water such as water butts and garden ponds which do not contain fish. A single water butt can be a source of several hundred mosquitoes. Association The president of the association is Paul Schädler, scientific director of KABS is Norbert Becker. It is financed by subscription (membership fees of the 98 affiliated municipal areas). For a city such as Wiesbaden (population 570,000) this means a fee of 45 thousand euros per year. International activity KABS also makes its expertise internationally available. Under its English name of German Mosquito Control Association it supports the world-wide mosquito control programme of the WHO and is member of the World Mosquito Control Association.WHO publications: Guideline Specifications for Bacterial Larvicides for Public Health Use, S. 32 Current developments As flood protection is becoming ever more prevalent, the near future will see an increase in low-lying land. These planned flood areas will be further breeding ground for mosquitoes and will require additional effort which will probably require a third helicopter.

It serviced the Auckland-Niue route weekly, and later fortnightly, until its closure in 1992. The route was operated by a chartered Air Nauru 737 and carried mail. Flights were sometimes cancelled if passenger numbers or freight was not enough to fund the flight. The airline was majority New Zealand-owned (with some Niuean investment). The airline's uniforms were designed by Dutch-New Zealand fashion designer Doris De Pont. Niue Airlines was not linked to any international booking system, and so tickets could only be purchased at ticket offices, one of which was located in Auckland. The IATA code of the airline was FN. In October 1990, Niue Airlines flew twenty-three pupils (and their parents and teachers) to the island after discovering it had 40 vacant seats on a flight. The group from Three Kings Primary School in Auckland, whose travel was arranged at no cost, was greeted with garlands of flowers, appeared on local television, had a short swim in the ocean and were then farewelled by Premier Sir Robert Rex after a whirlwind trip. In 1991, services were operated from Auckland to Niue, and returned via Tonga. Towards the end of the airline's life, services were only operated between Pago Pago and Niue using a nine-seat Beechcraft King Air. Travelling from Auckland to Niue then required stopovers in Apia and Pago Pago. The airline ceased to operate in late 1992, when, after the Niuean government refused to provide bank guarantees for the purchase of aviation fuel, they defaulted on a fuel bill and their licence was cancelled.

Established in 2012, it has since founded some twenty ventures globally, including financial comparison platforms CompareAsiaGroup, CompareEuropeGroup, and Coru; POS financing platform Vendigo; and formerly digital marketing agency Lion & Lion (sold to Septeni Holdings Co., Ltd. (TYO: 4293) ). History Early years Nova Founders Capital was founded by Mads Faurholt-Jorgensen, Raphael Strauch, and Stefan Bruun. The founding team met each other in Asia-Pacific, initially to launch operations of Groupon, later becoming global partners at Rocket Internet. While at Rocket, they oversaw the launch of Internet companies like online retailers Zalora and Lazada, and online meal delivery service foodpanda. At the same time, they saw the potential in taking active ownership of startup companies, particularly those involved in financial technology. Post- funding history On September 18, 2014, Nova Founders Capital secured major funding through the Pacific Century Group, headed by Richard Li, the son of Hong Kong businessman Li Ka-shing. The Pacific Century Group invested $50 million in Nova to help it launch online financial services companies, on the belief that this industry was the last big Internet frontier. Following this funding round, more core team members were relocated to Hong Kong, where the company has one of its two head offices, the second of which is based in Mayfair, London, UK. In addition, Nova has led fundraising rounds for other companies, including a seed investment round for German/Swiss/Austrian e-invoicing platform Crossinx and Series A and B rounds for financial comparison platform CompareAsiaGroup—which gained significant traction prior to funding. At CompareAsiaGroup's Series B funding round a total of $50,000,000 was raised. As of August 2018, Nova Founders Capital currently has 20 companies in its portfolio. Investment philosophy Nova Founders Capital builds and supports sustainable, large-scale internet businesses in the financial services sector. The Nova Founders network consists of more than 500 entrepreneurs across 15 countries. Prior to an investment, the Nova Founders team decides where the potential funds should be allocated, usually falling into three categories: building, investing in or acquiring companies. Although Nova Founders Capital officially is considered a venture capital firm, most of the investments are channeled into building new business from scratch. When investing, Nova Founders limits the number of investments it makes in a given year, to ensure that the team can continue to add significant value operationally. Partners and portfolio The companies generally included in Nova Founders Capital's portfolio operate in a number of fields, though since 2014 they have been oriented towards banking, insurance and consumer finance products. CompareAsiaGroup CompareAsiaGroup is a localized financial comparison platform aggregating more than 1,500 financial products, with sites deployed in seven Asian countries: Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Philippines, Taiwan and Thailand. Founded in 2013, it is the largest financial comparison platform in Asia. The group employs close to 200 people and was most recently funded in April 2015 by a $40 million Series A investment led by Goldman Sachs, which in addition to Nova Founders Capital included Jardine Pacific, ACE&Company;, Route 66 Ventures and angel investors such as Mark Pincus and Owen Van Natta. In that round, over $40 million was invested into the company. In 2017, CompareAsiaGroup, received a total of US$50 million in new funding from investors. The new funding was led by International Finance Corp (IFC), a unit of World Bank while the other investors were investors were Alibaba Entrepreneurs Fund, SBI Group and H&Q; Utrust, as well as existing investors Goldman Sachs Investment Partners VC and Growth Equity, Nova Founders Capital, ACE & Company and Route 66 Ventures. In 2018, failing to agree with the new investors in CompareAsiaGroup, Nova Founders Capital stopped operating the technical side of CompareAsiaGroup, which moved to Singapore for a complete re-platforming. Stefan Bruun, acting CEO of the technical operation company behind CompareAsiaGroup, was moved back from Hong Kong to London. Coru.com  Coru is a financial comparison platform active in Mexico, operating similarly to its sister portals in Europe and Asia. The platform compares personal loans, credit cards and car insurance products amongst others, and is backed by the Spanish venture capital firm Seaya Ventures, American fintech investors QED, and Thiel Capital. It was created after Nova Founder Capital lost control over the technical platform of its predecessor, ComparaGuru.com. Crossinx Crossinx is a Frankfurt-based company that offers services for electronic in- and outbound invoices with suppliers and customers, deployed by companies such as Nestlé, Bayer and Sixt, as well as the German government. Nova Founders Capital was a participant in the company's Series A fundraising round conducted on 1 December 2014, where an undisclosed amount was invested in the company. Lion & Lion Lion & Lion is a digital advertising agency specialising in online marketing campaigns and digital advertising solutions. By late 2016 Lion & Lion acquired by the Japanese Septeni Holdings for an undisclosed USD double-digit million amount and the company is therefore no longer a part of Nova Founders Capital's portfolio.

It was built in 1828 and housed poor, elderly, and mentally ill residents who could not otherwise take care of themselves. In 1957 it was sold via auction to Brown University and demolished for a complex of athletic fields and buildings. Benefactor This statue of Ebenezer Knight Dexter stands at the Dexter Training Ground, near the Cranston Street Armory Providence had no institution to care for the poor prior to the Dexter Asylum. People unable to support themselves would be taken care of in private homes by caretakers who bid for the job. Ebenezer Knight Dexter was a wealthy mercantile trader in Providence. Upon his death in 1824, he bequeathed to the town his 40-acre Neck Farm on the East Side of Providence. Dexter stipulated in his will that a poor farm or almshouse must be built on the site within five years. In 1828, the Dexter Asylum was completed and opened, named for its benefactor. Building and grounds 1871 engraving Building The building itself was originally three stories high, and later expanded with a mansard roof and dormers. Wall The property was known as much for its unusual stone boundary wall as for the building itself. The specifications of the wall were detailed in Dexter's will, which required that the city build \\"a good, permanent stone wall of at least 3 feet thick at the bottom and at least 8 feet high and to be placed on a foundation of small stones as thick as the bottom wall and sunk 2 feet into the ground.\\" It took eight years and $12,700 to complete the wall, which was over a mile long. It is unclear whether the purpose of the wall was to protect the privacy of asylum residents, or to protect the neighbors from seeing the downtrodden residents within. Over time, the wall grew into local legend. Boastful locals would claim to have picnicked on the wall or to have walked or even bicycled the entire perimeter. Wealthy neighbors sometimes viewed the wall as an eyesore; portions still stand today. Life at Dexter Asylum At the time of its building, poor farms were considered a humane, progressive way to deal with poverty. The idea was that poor, elderly, and ill people would earn their keep by working in a vegetable and dairy farm instead of begging on the streets. Proceeds from the farms helped the asylum to be financially self-sufficient and even to turn a profit, at least for a time. The dairy farm included cows and pigs. Residents at Dexter Asylum were typically unemployed immigrants, mostly from Ireland. They were indentured for a period of six months and subject to strict rules of daily conduct. Residents included both men and women, but they were strictly separated. Visitors were admitted only once every three weeks. Despite living on a working farm, residents were served only white bread and tea for dinner. By 1849, the institution faced overcrowding, with 190 residents living at the asylum at its height. That number was trimmed to around 100, where it remained for most of the rest of its existence. Closing and destruction By the early 20th century, the asylum had begun to decline. A poorhouse was seen as undesirable as the neighborhood grew in affluence. Also, society's ideas were changing on how to help the poor; poor farms were becoming an anachronism as states started establishing welfare programs. The resident population at Dexter also declined. The city started to look for ways to close the institution; however, Dexter's will had specified that the town could never sell the property and that it could only be used for his specified purpose. The city spent years in court working to overturn this requirement and brought its first case as early as 1926, in an effort to turn the property into housing. This case was lost, but the state Supreme Court eventually cleared the way for a public auction. In 1956, the plot was auctioned off, and Brown University won with a bid of $1,000,777, or $25,653 per acre. Eight people were still living in the facility at the time of the sale. They were moved, the existing buildings were demolished, and an athletic complex was eventually built on the site. The city set aside the money from the sale to create the Dexter Donation, which gives annual grants to assist the city's poor.

In its general form it says that the present value of current and future cash outflows cannot exceed the present value of currently available funds and future cash inflows. Typically this is expressed as :sum_{t=0}^T frac{x_t}{(1+r)^t} le sum_{t=0}^T frac{w_t}{(1+r)^t} , where x_t is expenditure at time t, w_t is the cash that becomes available at time t, T is the most distant relevant time period, 0 is the current time period, and frac{1}{1+r} is the discount factor computed from the interest rate r. Complications are possible in various circumstances. For example, the interest rate for discounting cash receipts might be greater than the interest rate for discounting expenditures, because future inflows may be borrowed against while currently available funds may be invested temporarily pending use for future expenditures, and borrowing rates may exceed investment returns. Applications In most applications, the entire budget would be used up, because any unspent funds would represent unobtained potential utility. In these situations, the intertemporal budget constraint is effectively an equality constraint. In an intertemporal consumption model, the sum of utilities from expenditures made at various times in the future, these utilities discounted back to the present at the consumer's rate of time preference, would be maximized with respect to the amounts xt consumed in each period, subject to an intertemporal budget constraint. In a model of intertemporal portfolio choice, the objective would be to maximize the expected value or expected utility of final period wealth. Since investment returns in each period generally would not be known in advance, the constraint effectively imposes a limit on the amount that can be invested in the final period--namely, whatever the wealth accumulated as of the end of the next-to- last period is.

He was also a respected leader in the Abenaki community. Masta published Abenaki Legends, Grammar, and Place Names in 1932. He began writing the book in 1929 at 77 years of age. Abenaki is a member of the Algonquian languages family and is spoken in Quebec and neighboring US states. There are few native speakers—the language is spoken by only 3% of the current Abenaki population. Masta was fluent in French, English and the Abenaki language. Early education and writing He received his primary and secondary education at the Protestant school and church founded by his uncle, Pial Pol Wz8khilain, on the Saint Francis Indian reserve. His teacher there was tribal chief of the Abenaki at Odanak, Quebec, Joseph Laurent. Following Wzokhilain’s guide, the threesome published language texts and wrote text books for use within the community. Laurent, also known as Sozap Lolô, is esteemed as a Native American linguist who helped preserve his own language. Ives Goddard, a noted historian of linguistics, observed of Laurent, \\"This is a really remarkable case of native grammatical tradition emerging among native people.\\" The works that they wrote spanned the Five Nations and Native Americans by successfully translating Wabanki cosmology, demonstrating the continuance of names and stories associated with particular places in communal memory, even for those families who lived outside the original home territory in Quebec. In addition, Masta's Abenaki Legends, Grammar, and Place Names explains etymology pertaining to large areas of land, rivers, and traditions. College, marriage and career Masta later attended Sabrevois College near St-Johns, P.Q. While there, he studied Latin and Greek. In 1875, he married Caroline Tahamont.

Shambhuka in the Treta Yuga Twenty two years ago, my name was Kanchikacherla Kotesu My place of birth is Kilvenmani, Karamchedu, Neerukonda Now Chunduru is the name that cold-blooded feudal brutality Has tattooed on my heart with ploughshares From now on, Chunduru is not a noun but a pronoun Now every heart is a Chunduru, a burning tumour I am the wound of multitudes, the multitude of wounds For generations, an unfree individual in a free country Having been the target Of humiliations, atrocities, rapes and torture I am someone raising his head for a fistful of self-respect In this nation of casteist bigots blinded by wealth I am someone who lives to register life itself as a protest I am someone who dies repeatedly to live Don't call me a victim I am an immortal, I am an immortal, I am an immortal* ~ Kalekuri Prasad burst upon the Telugu literary world like a meteor a couple of decades ago. There would be at least one line of his in every song in the Jana Natya Mandali's (the cultural wing of the People's War Group which was later merged into the CPI (Maoist) party) repertoire in its early days. According to Dappu Prakash, Prasad had written, directly or indirectly, hundreds of songs in those days. There were many among them which attained great popularity. Whatever Prasad spoke seemed like poetry, therefore there would always be a crowd of people around him, eager to listen to him. He was one of the speakers on the occasion of the release my first book, 'Dalit Awaaz', at the Hyderabad Press Club. The function should have ended at 9 pm, but Prasad arrived at 8.45. Those who were planning to leave sat down again. He spoke for around 40 minutes, and no one moved. The Press Club employees who had come over to warn us to wind up the meeting also stayed to listen. He wrote a book review for the book on the following day, which was published in 'Vaartha' daily on 27 March, 2011. Even though his review was on the same book as his speech a day earlier, there was no similarity between the two in vocabulary or style – such was his command on Telugu. He translated around seventy books (from English) into Telugu. He was the one who introduced international revolutionaries like Che Guevara to the Telugu readers. He was the one who translated important books like Swami Dharma Theertha's \\"The Menace of Hindu Imperialism\\" and Arundhati Roy's \\"The God of Small Things\\" into Telugu. His translation of Abdul Kalam's book was commissioned by a well known educationist in the state who later published it in his own name. He had translated, unacknowledged, hundreds of books in a similar manner during his lifetime. I had once told him that I would write an essay on him, if he died, calling him 'Kalekuri Prasad, Dalit bairagi philosopher'. I asked him whether he liked the title. He replied quite calmly that he liked it. Even when I tried to probe him repeatedly, to provoke some reaction, he just smiled and said 'Your article's title matches your writing capabilities'. But I didn't want to slot Kalekuri Prasad into any particular category so I did not use that title for this article. He was unique, Kalekuri Prasad stood for Kalekuri Prasad. Death did not scare Kalekuri Prasad, nor did life for that matter. He mocked at life, his conduct was such that it was an incomprehensible enigma to many progressive intellectuals, leaders, poets, critics who espoused revolutionary ideals in public and stuck to traditional religiosity in their private lives. He was a snake in the backyard of those dominant caste revolutionaries whose practice didn't match their preaching. For a man with integrity to give up faith in life only one core belief of his needs to be proven wrong. But Kalekuri Prasad was betrayed thrice. First, when he was surrounded by charlatans masquerading as revolutionaries; second, when a lover pretended to be a lover as part of a political ploy; third, when faced with a dishonest Dalit leadership. Kalekuri was pushed towards alcohol and was branded as an alcoholic by the same three categories of people listed above. Kalekuri's alcoholism destroyed his health and dented his friends' purses – those were the two not so major losses that were the result of it. But the real major loss to society was that it lost an honest intellectual. More than the loss due to his drinking, the loss caused by the canards spread about his alcoholism was greater. He stood as an individual who refused to be co-opted by the establishment: though branded as an alcoholic, Kalekuri Prasad was an upright thinker, poet, writer, critic and a romantic. He was not a postmodernist, never a person without an agenda. He was a bairagi philosopher who craved for an uncorrupted world in which everyone lived with equity and wholesome cultural values. A true Buddhist monk who had nothing of his own, a real communist, a full-time social activist. Like the eminent Dalit revolutionary thinker K. G. Satyamurthy, who was one of the founders of the People's War Group, Kalekuri Prasad too was a guile-less individual who never hid anything. There are many other similarities between them; to be honest, neither had any personal life of their own. They were both two great common men who were totally dedicated to society. kalekuri 33 Kalekuri Prasad never attempted to push under the mask of privacy all those issues – marriage, sex, belongings, even his writing, name and honours – that people normally consider very private. He was a rare individual who was willing to share anything, at any moment of time, with anyone. There was a plot, there was caste behind the efforts to turn Kalekuri Prasad into a drunk, and project him as such. From the time he started drinking, there was never a day when he didn't drink, but even then there was never an occasion on which he passed out, until the day he died. Whether he was drunk or not, he could always speak the truth with the same lucidity and honesty. If he had drunk as much as he was slandered to have drunk he couldn't have lasted the last two decades of his life. There are many more writers and intellectuals around us who drink much more. He had to face more badmouthing than he deserved. He lived a nomad's life; someone who has nothing owns the whole world. Someone who doesn't draw a line between himself and the world in the name of family starts to view the whole world as his kin. That's exactly how he lived and died. He died on May 17, 2013, in Ambedkar Bhavan, Ongole. He never lived with his family. If he suffered from stark poverty on one day, he stayed in a five star hotel on the next. If he traveled in a truck on one day, he flew in a plane on the next. Whatever luxury or privation that came his way never influenced his inner personality. There would be no change in his conduct. There were days in his life when he slept on the pavement outside the Ambedkar Bhavan on Lower Tank Bund or the Prajashakti book store in Hyderabad. Though he came from a family of means and his relatives were quite willing to find opportunities to improve his financial condition, he chose to remain with his friends, and the poor who surrounded him all through his life. He would talk with intellectuals the same way he would with the uneducated poor, with women the same way as he would with men, with the elderly the same way as he would with the young. A person's social or economic status never influenced Kalekuri Prasad – he would pay the same respect to everyone. Treating everyone equally was a great humanitarian value that he practiced more consistently than anyone else. He had great love for people; whether he knew them or not he would interact with all with the same respect and affability. If someone came to him with a problem, the moment he understood it, it became his problem. He would explore all the options available to him to solve it, immerse himself totally in it, and would not rest until he resolved it. Usually people are repelled by those who profess high sounding principles but never practice them in their own personal lives. But Kalekuri was different; he would not scorn them but would only offer gentle criticism. That criticism would also incorporate suggestions for improvement. Therefore, most people regarded his criticism as useful and no one was ever angered by it, but welcomed it to an extent. I got to know Kalekuri Prasad very late. He had visited our home in Champapet, Hyderabad, in May 2005, along with Venkateshwarlu (of Tenali). He stayed with us until November of that year, going out only occasionally on brief visits. My brother Battula Prakash, a social activist, also stayed in that room. K. G. Satyamurthy would also visit us often. The only little problem we faced with Prasad was of increased expenses. We used to discuss a lot of issues, but I remember one debate on inter-caste marriage that I had started in which Kalekuri Prasad participated seriously. From the Champapet Chowrasta to our room in East Marutinagar, Prasad expounded at length on how inter-caste marriages should be. He felt that inter-caste marriages should lead to a sense of kinship between hundreds of families related to the groom and the bride, but instead they engendered enmity between those two groups. Even those families which considered themselves progressive were not an exception to this trend, he said. In May 2009, after staying for a mere two months at his sister's home, he returned saying he could not live there. My brother and Prasad's sister had planned to get him treated for alcohol addiction, but he opposed the idea when he got wind of it and returned to Hyderabad. However, my brother and his friends, Siddeshwar and Narender, managed to get him to stay in a hotel in Warangal from July 2009 till December 2009 and got him treated for some ailment there. But suspecting that they were trying to get him treated for addiction without his consent, Prasad jumped from his hotel room. The truth was he was not being treated for addiction. His leg was broken, and after it was healed he returned to his native village, Kanchikacherla. Since then, he had spent all of his time, until his death, in either Kanchikacherla or in Ongole, with his friend Palnati Sriramulu and others. His visits to Hyderabad were also very few and brief. Writing was never so difficult – and there is so much to write about Kalekuri Prasad, how can one say it all in one article? One could write volumes about Kalekuri Prasad's poetry, songs, literature, criticism, essays and translations etc., and one could write much more about his personality, social consciousness and personal conduct. Fortunately, Kalekuri Prasad was born in an 'untouchable' caste, therefore he became an intellectual who was so accessible to the poor, the oppressed and the Dalits. Had he been born in any dominant caste he would not have remained so close to the common folk, he would have become a memorial lecture in some department in one or another university. Now there's no such danger, he will remain alive among the people. kalekuri 11 There is a need to bring all his writing into print but because of his caste no university would take up this task. He voiced no such desire either, but because of the significance of his writing, those working in the Dalit, left and revolutionary politics should definitely make an effort to realize this objective. We should not attempt it for his sake but for our own needs. As a part of that exercise Ravichandran, a Dalit rights activist, interviewed Prasad on his life and literature and uploaded it on Dalit Camera. Life Kalekuri Prasad was born in Kanchikacherla village, Krishna district, Andhra Pradesh. He played an important role in Dalit literature and Dalit activism in Andhra Pradesh with his writing, songs, and speeches. Dalit movement in Andhra Pradesh Prasad worked in Jananatyamandali, Virsam, and former member of Peoples War Group. He actively participated in the Dalit movement at the time of the Chundur Massacre/Tsundur massacre (1991), Karamchedu massacre (17 July 1985), along with Bojja Tharakam, K.G. Satyamurthi, and others. He participated in the World Conference against Racism 2001, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Tolerance (WCAR), which was organised by the United Nations in Durban from 31 August to 8 September. Works Prasad's songs have been used in many films. He edited magazines. He translated 70 books from English to Telugu including The God of Small Things by Arundhati Roy. He wrote in Telugu \\"Andhra Predesh lo Dalitulu\\". Death Kalekuri Prasad died on 17 May 2013 at Ongole, Ambedkar Bhavan.

Major publications have included its flagship journal, Christian Standard, and church education materials including Vacation Bible School curricula. In 2015, Standard Publishing became an imprint of David C. Cook when the latter acquired the company's Bible lesson commentary series, Sunday school curriculum and other church resources. The company's remaining assets, including Christian Standard, The Lookout, and digital resources for churches, are now produced under the name Christian Standard Media. Founding The founding of Standard Publishing parallels the history of the Restoration Movement. Isaac Errett, Herbert Moninger, J. D. Murch, Lillie Faris, Guy P. Leavitt, C. P. Sharp, P. H. Welshimer, W. R. Walker, and Burris Butler were all editors, publishers, and contributors and were all leaders of the Restoration Movement (1790-1825). Standard Publishing began with a group of physicians, attorneys, educators, preachers, including James A. Garfield, who would later become the twentieth president of the United States. In December 1865, this group met at the home of T. W. Phillips, a noted businessman and philanthropist in New Castle, Pennsylvania. They met to consider launching a journal that would be \\"devoted to New Testament Christianity, its doctrine, its ordinances, and its fruits.\\" The first issue came off the press dated April 7, 1866 with Errett as editor The group organized a publishing association, funded it with $20,000 in capital, and named the journal Christian Standard. Isaac Errett of Detroit, Michigan, was named the first editor. The first issue came off the press dated April 7, 1866. Errett continued as editor, even as he became president of the newly- established Alliance College in Alliance, Ohio, in 1868. In 1869, he partnered with R. W. Carroll, a printer and publisher, in Cincinnati, Ohio. In 1872, Errett, Carroll, and Errett's 22-year-old son, Russell, incorporated their publishing house as Standard Publishing. Printing history A two-story building at Ninth and Cutter Streets was purchased in 1914. The Ferro Construction Company erected the company's building at Eighth and Cutter Streets, reported to be the first concrete and steel building put up west of Pittsburgh. That year the company began to do color printing, which was new at that time. Also established was an engraving division known as the Sterling Engraving Company. In 1945, a new building at Parkway and Jackson Streets, was purchased to house the company's expanded offices. A bookstore opened in 1947. In 1955, the company moved to a new, air-conditioned plant in Mount Healthy, a northern suburb of Cincinnati. This single-story plant occupied about seven acres and housed composing, preliminary, printing, binding, and mailing operations. The printing plant included several web as well as large sheetfed presses including a press to apply felt backing to cut-out figures creating flannelgraph sets. In 1973, the company's printing plant consumed 27,500,000 pounds of paper and more than 400,000 pounds of ink. The company eventually moved out of the printing business and relocated to its current office complex just north of Cincinnati. Publications After the American Sunday School Union formed the International Sunday-School Lessons, the first Uniform Lessons appeared in Christian Standard in 1873. The company has published Uniform Lessons in a variety of formats since that time. In 1954, this material was presented in an annual bound volume, The Standard Lesson Commentary. It continues today in various editions annually. Early examples of age-appropriate journals included Sunday School Standard, Boy’s Life, and Girlhood Days. Today all ages of study are represented. Standard Lesson is adult Bible study materials for Sunday school, small groups or personal studies. Encounter offers Sunday school curriculum for junior high and high school teens. 40 Instant Studies caters to small group topical Bible studies for teens. For younger children, Standard Publishing publishes HeartShaper Sunday school curriculum for ages 1 – 12; 13 Very Series for small group Bible studies ages 3 – 12; Route 52 a Bible study curriculum for ages 3 – 12, CAMP - large group event for ages 5 – 12; and Biblical Choices which is designed for Christian school or homeschool bible study K – 6th grade. Young People’s Standard was created to serve the Christian Endeavor movement for Christian Youth, founded in 1888. Six years later Young People’s Standard became The Lookout, a weekly Christian magazine for adults with features to apply their faith and study the Bible, still published weekly today. The first edition of Training for Service was published in 1911, which in its several updated editions, is used as a Sunday school teacher training text. In 1913, Standard Publishing became the first publisher of Vacation Bible School (VBS) materials with a five-week, all-day program.\\"Standard Publishing's VBS Celebrates 80th Birthday\\" Lookout Magazine March 30, 2003. Meanwhile, Christian Standard, the journal from which the company took its name, was published every week from 1866 till September 2012 when it introduced a new 64-page monthly edition. In 2014, Christian Standard introduced an app for digital editions available on smartphones and tablets.  Ownership history  After 1872, the Erretts bought Carroll’s share of the company. Standard Publishing continued under the ownership and control of the Errett family until 1955 when it was sold to John Bolten Sr. Under his leadership it became a multinational corporation, eventually known as Standex International. In July 2006, the Wicks Group, a New York-based private equity firm, acquired Standard Publishing. It was used as an imprint of New Mountain Learning. In 2007, the company moved to modern offices on the north side of Cincinnati, where the successor company, Christian Standard Media, continues today. In 2015, David C Cook acquired the Standard Publishing brand together with the company's Bible lesson commentary series, Sunday school curriculum and other church resources from New Mountain Learning. Christian Standard and The Lookout were not included in the deal and are published by Christian Standard Media. In 2017, Christian Standard Media was acquired by The Solomon Foundation.

The centrifuge was designed as a molecular gastronomy experiment to separate food, and can achieve 1800 g-force. In 2012, Warren was featured in Popular Science Magazine for his project concealing a battery operated soldering iron inside an airsoft gun. The airsoft pistol had a removable ammunition clip which the batteries for the soldering iron were hidden, the trigger action activated the soldering iron.

He was the son of Sir John Harrison, by his first wife, and sister of the memoirist Ann, Lady Fanshawe. He graduated from St Catherine's College, Cambridge early in 1638, having been there about a year since matriculation, and having joined Gray's Inn in October 1637. His sister recorded his selection (for ) \\"around 1641\\" at the beginning of the Long Parliament. Queenborough on the coast of Kent was a rotten borough in the fashion of the 17th century: one of its MPs would be nominated, by the normal convention, by the future Philip Herbert, 4th Earl of Pembroke, from 1616, as Constable of the Castle. Harrison was quite prominent in the first session of the Long Parliament, as noted by Simonds D'Ewes. His father, an important financier, agreed to give up £50,000 to the parliament, and Harrison was nominated to receive it. When Charles I of England went to Nottingham in August 1642, to raise the Royal Standard—the event that marked the outbreak of the First English Civil War—Harrison accompanied him. Parliament retaliated against his father. On 24 June 1643 Harrison was expelled from the House of Commons. Days later, he died of an injury caused by a fall with his horse, in Oxfordshire, in a skirmish with parliamentary forces under the Earl of Essex. He was buried in Exeter College Chapel, according to his sister's memoirs; but in the church of St Peter the Great, according to the editor of the 1907 edition.

In his family there were five brothers, all of them holding a great affinity for Christianity and who together with their parents helped the poor. From them, Peter heard a calling to the monastic life. Patriarch Nicholas I Mysticus wished to make him the Bishop of Corinth, but he demurred in favor of his brother, Paul, as he wished to remain a monk.

The influences on cuisine in this region of the United States are extremely eclectic owing to the fact that it has been and continues to be a gateway for international culture as well as a gateway for new immigrants. Colonial times Going back to colonial times, each new group has left their mark on homegrown cuisine and in turn the cities in this region disperse trends to the wider United States. In addition to importing and trading the finest specialty foods from all over the world, cities such as Baltimore and Philadelphia have had the past influence of Italian, German, Irish, British and Jewish cuisines and that continues to this day, and Baltimore has become the crossroads between North and South, a distinction it has held since the end of the Civil War. Characteristics Eggs Benedict, a breakfast dish made with poached eggs and hollandaise sauce, served with smoked salmon Since the first reference to an alcoholic mixed drink called a cocktail comes from New York State in 1803, it is thus not a surprise that there have been many cocktails invented in New York and the surrounding environs. Long Island iced teas, Manhattans, Rob roys, Tom Collins, Aviations, and Greyhounds were all invented in New York bars, and the gin martini was popularized in New York in speakeasies during the 1920s, as evidenced by its appearance in the works of New Yorker and American writer F. Scott Fitzgerald. In Philadelphia, many rare and unusual liquors and liqueurs often find their way into a mixologist's cupboard or restaurant wine list. New York State is the third most productive area in the country for wine grapes, just behind the more famous California and Washington. It has AVA's near the Finger Lakes, the Catskills, and Long Island, and in the Hudson Valley has the second most productive area in the country for growing apples, making it a center for hard cider production, just like New England. Pennsylvania has been growing rye since Germans began to emigrate to the area at the end of the 17th century and required a grain they knew from home. Therefore, overall it is not unusual to find New York grown Gewürtztraminer and Riesling, Pennsylvania rye whiskey, or marques of locally produced ciders like Original Sin on the same menu. Complicated dishes Many of the more complicated dishes with rich ingredients like Lobster Newberg, Waldorf salad, vichyssoise, eggs benedict, and the New York strip steak were born out of a need to entertain and impress the well to do in expensive bygone restaurants like Delmonico's and still standing establishments like the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, and today that tradition remains alive as some of the most expensive and exclusive restaurants in the country are found in this region. New York-style pizzaSince their formative years, New York City, New Jersey, Philadelphia, and Baltimore have welcomed immigrants of every kind to their shores, and all four have been an important gateway through which new citizens to the general United States arrive. Traditionally natives have eaten cheek to jowl with newcomers for centuries as the newcomers would open new restaurants and small businesses and all the different groups would interact. Even in colonial days this region was a very diverse mosaic of peoples, as settlers from Switzerland, Wales, England, Ulster, Wallonia, Holland, Gelderland, the British Channel Islands, and Sweden sought their fortune in this region. This is very evident in many signature dishes and local foods, all of which have evolved to become American dishes in their own right. The original Dutch settlers of New York brought recipes they knew and understood from home and their mark on local cuisine is still apparent today: in many quarters of New York their version of apple pie with a streusel top is still baked, while originating in the colony of New Amsterdam their predilection for waffles in time evolved into the American national recipe and forms part of a New York brunch, and they also made coleslaw, originally a Dutch salad, but today accented with the later 18th century introduction of mayonnaise. The internationally famous American doughnut began its life originally as a New York pastry that arrived in the 18th century as the Dutch olykoek.See entries for oliebol and oliekoek in Crab cake served on a bun Crabcakes were once a kind of English croquette, but over time as spices have been added they and the Maryland crab feast became two of Baltimore's signature dishes; fishing for the blue crab is a favorite summer pastime in the waters off Maryland, New Jersey, Long Island, and Delaware where they may grace the table at summer picnics . Other mainstays of the region have been present since the early years of American history, like oysters from Cape May, the Chesapeake Bay, and Long Island, and lobster and tuna from the coastal waters found in New York and New Jersey, which are exported to the major cities as an expensive delicacy or a favorite locavore's quarry at the multitude of farmer's markets, very popular in this region. Philadelphia pepper pot, a tripe stew was originally a British dish but today is a classic of home cooking in Pennsylvania alongside bookbinder soup, a type of turtle soup. In winter, New York pushcarts sell roasted chestnuts, a delicacy dating back to English Christmas traditions, and it was in New York and Pennsylvania that the earliest Christmas cookies were introduced: Germans introduced crunchy molasses based gingerbread and sugar cookies in Pennsylvania, and the Dutch introduced cinnamon based cookies, all of which have become part of the traditional Christmas meal. Scrapple was originally a type of savory pudding that early Pennsylvania Germans made to preserve the offal of a pig slaughter. The Philadelphia soft pretzel was originally brought at the beginning of the 18th century to Eastern Pennsylvania and later 19th century immigrants sold them to the masses from pushcarts to make them the city's best-known bread product, having evolved into its own unique recipe. A bowl of Buffalo wings 19th century immigrants After the 1820s, new groups began to arrive and the character of the region began to change. There had been some Irish from Ulster prior to 1820, however largely they had been Protestants with somewhat different food patterns and (often) a different language than the explosion of emigrants that came to Castle Garden and Locust Point in their masses starting in the 1840s. Taverns had existed prior to their emigration to America in the region, though they brought their particular brand of pub culture and founded some of the first saloons and bars that served stout. Irish were the first immigrant group to arrive in this region in massive numbers immigrants also founded some of the earliest saloons and bars in this region, of which McSorley's is an example. Migrants from Southern Europe, namely Sicily, Campania, Lazio, and Calabria, appeared between 1880-1960 in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Eastern Maryland hoping to escape the extreme poverty and corruption endemic to Italy; typically they were employed in manual labor or factory work but it is because of them that dishes like spaghetti with meatballs, New York style pizza, calzones, and baked ziti exist, and Americans of today are very familiar with semolina based pasta noodles. New York style hot dogs came about with German speaking emigrants from Austria and Germany, particularly with the frankfurter sausage and the smaller wiener sausage. Today the New York style hot dog with sauerkraut, mustard, and the optional cucumber pickle relish is such a part of the local fabric that it is one of the favorite comestibles of New York City. Hot dogs are a typical street food sold year round in all but the most inclement weather from thousands of pushcarts. As with all other stadiums in Major League Baseball they are an essential for New York Yankees and the New York Mets games though it is the local style of preparation that predominates without exception. Hot dogs are also the focus of a televised eating contest on the Fourth of July in Coney Island, at Nathan's Famous, one of the earliest hot dog stands opened in the United States in 1916. Every year on Coney Island, New Yorkers celebrate the Fourth of July by attending or participating in Nathan's hot dog eating contest. 20th century A summertime treat, Italian ice, began its life as a lemon flavored penny lick brought to Philadelphia by Italians; its Hispanic counterpart, piragua, is a common and evolving shaved ice treat brought to New York by Puerto Ricans in the 1930s. Unlike the original dish which included flavors like tamarind, mango, coconut, piragua is evolving to include flavors like grape, a fruit not grown in Puerto Rico. Pork roll, a meat delicacy of New Jersey, first appeared around the time of the Civil War and today is often served for breakfast with eggs and cheese on a kaiser roll, the bread upon which this is served was brought to the area by Austrians in the second half of the nineteenth century and is a very common roll for sandwiches at lunchtime, usually tipped with poppyseeds. This breakfast meat is generally known as pork roll in southern New Jersey and Philadelphia, and Taylor Ham in northern New Jersey, although Taylor Ham is technically a brand of pork roll. Philadelphia cheesesteak \\"wiz wit\\", i.e. steak, Cheez Whiz, \\"wit\\" onions Other dishes came about during the early 20th century and have much to do with delicatessen fare, set up largely by Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe who came to America incredibly poor and most often unable to partake in the outdoor food markets that the general population utilized. The influence of European Jewry on modern mid-Atlantic cooking remains extremely strong and reinforced by their many descendants in the region. American-style pickles were brought by Polish Jews, now a common addition to hamburgers and sandwiches, and Hungarian Jews brought a recipe for almond horns that now is a common regional cookie, diverting from the original recipe in dipping the ends in dark chocolate. New York-style cheesecake has copious amounts of cream and eggs because animal rennet is not kosher and thus could not be sold to a large number of the deli's clientele. New York inherited its bagels and bialys from Jews, as well as Challah bread, the bread today most favored for making french toast in New York, New Jersey, and eastern Pennsylvania. Pastrami first entered the country via Romanian Jews, and is a feature of many sandwiches, often eaten on marble rye, a bread that was born in the mid Atlantic. Whitefish salad, lox, and matzoh ball soup are now standard fare made to order at local diners and delicatessens, but started their life as foods that made up a strict dietary code. Like other groups before them, many of their dishes passed into the mainstream enough so that they became part of diner fare by the end of the 20th century, a type of restaurant that is now more numerous in this region than any other and formerly the subject matter of artist Edward Hopper. In the past this sort of establishment was the haven of the short order cook grilling or frying simple foods for the working man. Today typical service would include regional staples like beef on weck, Manhattan clam chowder, the club sandwich, Buffalo wings, Philadelphia cheesesteak, the black and white cookie, shoofly pie, snapper soup, Smith Island cake, grape pie, milkshakes, and the egg cream, a vanilla or chocolate fountain drink with a frothy top and fizzy taste. As in Hopper's painting from 1942, many of these businesses are open 24 hours a day.

It was established as federal law with the Copyright Act of 1790. This act was updated many times, including a major revision in 1976. Colonial era The British Statute of Anne did not apply to the American colonies. The colonies' economy was largely agrarian, and copyright law was not a priority. As a result, only three private copyright acts were passed prior to 1783. Two of the acts were limited to seven years, the other to five years. 1783 to 1787 In 1783 several authors' petitions persuaded the Continental Congress \\"that nothing is more properly a man's own than the fruit of his study, and that the protection and security of literary property would greatly tend to encourage genius and to promote useful discoveries.\\" However, under the Articles of Confederation, the Continental Congress had no authority to issue a copyright. Instead it passed a resolution encouraging the States to \\"secure to the authors or publishers of any new book not hitherto printed ... the copy right of such books for a certain time not less than fourteen years from the first publication; and to secure to the said authors, if they shall survive the term first mentioned, ... the copy right of such books for another term of time no less than fourteen years.\\" Three states had already enacted copyright statutes in 1783 prior to the Continental Congress resolution, and in the subsequent three years all of the remaining states except Delaware passed a copyright statute., 58 Journal of the Copyright Society of the U.S.A. 431 (2011). Seven of the States followed the Statute of Anne and the Continental Congress' resolution by providing two fourteen-year terms. The five remaining States granted copyright for single terms of fourteen, twenty and twenty one years, with no right of renewal. Prior to the passage of the United States Constitution, several states passed their own copyright laws between 1783 and 1787, the first being Connecticut.Pelanda, Brian. Declarations of Cultural Independence: The Nationalistic Imperative Behind the Passage of Early American Copyright Laws, 1783–1787 58 Journal of the Copyright Society of the U.S.A. 431 (2011). Contemporary scholars and patriots such as Noah Webster, John Trumbull (poet), and Joel Barlow were instrumental in securing the passage of these statutes. United States Constitution Copyright Clause At the Constitutional Convention of 1787 both James Madison of Virginia and Charles C. Pinckney of South Carolina submitted proposals that would allow Congress the power to grant copyright for a limited time. These proposals are the origin of the Copyright Clause in the United States Constitution, which states: This clause is understood to grant Congress the power to enact copyright laws. The Copyright Clause forms the basis for both U.S. copyright law (\\"Science\\", \\"Authors\\", \\"Writings\\") and patent law (\\"useful Arts\\", \\"Inventors\\", \\"Discoveries\\"), and requires that these exclusive rights expire (\\"for limited Times\\"). Failed bill of rights provision Thomas Jefferson, who strongly advocated the ability of the public to share and build upon the works of others, suggested limiting copyright duration in the Bill of Rights, proposing the language: :Art. 9. Monopolies may be allowed to persons for their own productions in literature and their own inventions in the arts for a term not exceeding – years but for no longer term and no other purpose. Early federal copyright law Copyright Act of 1790 The Copyright Act of 1790 in the Columbian Centinel, full title \\"An act for the encouragement of learning by securing the copies of maps, charts, and books, to the authors and proprietors of such copies, during the times therein mentioned\\" The Congress first exercised its copyright powers with the Copyright Act of 1790. This act granted authors the exclusive right to publish and vend \\"maps, charts and books\\" for a term of 14 years. This 14-year term was renewable for one additional 14-year term, if the author was alive at the end of the first time. With exception of the provision on maps and charts the Copyright Act of 1790 is copied almost verbatim from the Statute of Anne. The 1790 Act did not regulate other kinds of writings, such as musical compositions or newspapers and specifically noted that it did not prohibit copying the works of foreign authors. The vast majority of writings were never registered. Between 1790 and 1799, of approximately 13,000 titles published in the United States, only 556 works were registered.. Under the 1790 Act, federal copyright protection was only granted if the author met certain \\"statutory formalities.\\" For example, authors were required to include a proper copyright notice. If formalities were not met, the work immediately entered into the public domain. And while musical compositions were not explicitly protected by the 1790 Act, its protection of \\"books\\" encompassed printed musical works. The first registration of a copyright in a musical composition in the United States was The Kentucky Volunteer in 1794.Federal Copyright Records 1790-‐‑1800 at 15 (1987) However, later accounts of the 1790 Act frequently misunderstand this point.E.g., White-Smith Music Pub. Co. v. Apollo Co., 209 U.S. 1, 15 (1908) Copyright Act of 1831 Congress first revised the copyright laws with the Copyright Act of 1831. This act extended the original copyright term from 14 years to 28 years (with an option to renew), and changed the copyright formality requirements. In 1834 the Supreme Court ruled in Wheaton v. Peters (a case similar to the British Donaldson v Beckett of 1774) that although the author of an unpublished work had a common law right to control the first publication of that work, the author did not have a common law right to control reproduction following the first publication of the work. During the American Civil War, the law of the Confederate States of America on copyright was broadly the same as that of the existing Copyright Act of 1831: twenty- eight years with an extension for fourteen, with mandatory registration. This was passed into law by an act in May 1861, shortly after the outbreak of hostilities. A later amendment, in April 1863, provided that any copyright registered in the United States before secession, and held by a current Confederate citizen or resident, was legally valid within the Confederacy. Confederate copyrights were apparently honored after the end of the war; when federal copyright records were transferred to the Library of Congress in 1870., pp. 248–9  Pan-American Convention of 1910  The Buenos Aires Convention of 1910, commonly known as the Third Pan-American Convention, provided mutual recognition of copyright between most countries in the Americas, and was ratified by the United States in 1911. Canada and some other countries or colonies were not signatories. Pre-1976 dual state and federal copyright law Before the 1976 Copyright Act, copyright protection was provided by a dual system under both federal and state laws. Federal law provided \\"statutory copyright\\" and the laws of each state provided \\"common law copyright.\\" Roughly speaking, the old \\"statutory copyright\\" protected works that were registered and the old \\"common-law copyright\\" protected unregistered works. With the 1976 Copyright Act, Congress abolished the dual federal-and- state copyright system, replacing it with a single federal copyright system. Federal preemption is codified at , which states: The preemption is complete insofar as works fall within the federal copyright statute. A work that falls generally within the subject matter of copyright (such as a writing) must either qualify to be protected under federal law, or it cannot be protected at all. State law cannot provide protection for a work that federal law does not protect.H.R. Rep. No. 1476, 94th Cong., 2d Sess., at 131 (1976) It covers enforcement too. A person accused of copyright infringement cannot be prosecuted in state courts.Crow v. Wainwright, 720 F.2d 1224 (11th Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 819 (1984).But see New Hampshire v. Nelson 150 N.H. 569 (2004). In Nelson, the defendant's conviction for receiving stolen property was affirmed. The \\"property\\" at issue was scanned copies of photographs that the defendant had removed from another's home. The defendant had returned the photographs, and the lack of any intent to permanently deprive the owner of the photos prevented prosecution based on removal of the physical photographs themselves. Thus, Nelson's conviction was based upon making and retaining the scanned copies. The issue of whether the statute was preempted by § 301 was not discussed. State copyright law is not preempted by non-protected works. For example, those that have \\"not been fixed in any tangible medium of expression are not covered.\\"S. Rpt. 94-473 \\"Examples would include choreography that has never been filmed or notated, an extemporaneous speech, original works of authorship communicated solely through conversations or live broadcasts, a dramatic sketch or musical composition improvised or developed from memory and without being recorded or written down.\\"S. Rpt. 94-473. See also Legislative history of Major amendments to federal copyright law Since 1790, Congress has amended federal copyright law numerous times. Major amendments include: *Copyright Act of 1790 – established U.S. copyright with term of 14 years with 14-year renewal *Copyright Act of 1831 – extended the term to 28 years with 14-year renewal *Copyright Act of 1909 – extended term to 28 years with 28-year renewal *Copyright Act of 1976 – extended term to either 75 years or the life of the author plus 50 years (prior to this, \\"[t]he interim renewal acts of 1962 through 1974 ensured that the copyright in any work in its second term as of September 19, 1962, would not expire before Dec. 31, 1976.\\");; see also Tom W.

Title II of the MMA, the CLASSICS Act, preempted state copyright laws for sound recordings made before February 15, 1972. Key international agreements affecting U.S. copyright law include: *Universal Copyright Convention *Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works *Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) The United States ratified the Universal Copyright Convention in 1954, and again in 1971. This treaty was developed by UNESCO as an alternative to the Berne Convention. The United States became a Berne Convention signatory in 1988. The Berne Convention entered into force in the U.S. a year later, on March 1, 1989. The U.S. is also a party to TRIPS, which requires compliance with Berne provisions, and is enforceable under the World Trade Organization dispute resolution process. To meet the treaty requirements, copyright protection was extended to architecture (where previously only building plans were protected, not buildings themselves), and certain moral rights of visual artists.

Heady, Professor of Forestry (Range Management), Emeritus, UC Berkeley Heady received in 1938 a B.S. from the University of Idaho and in 1940 an M.S. from the New York State College of Forestry in Syracuse. In 1942 he accepted a job teaching range management at Montana State University. Heady earned in 1949 a Ph.D. in plant ecology at the University of Nebraska under the prairie ecologist John Ernest Weaver and was, while working on his doctoral dissertation, on the faculty of Montana State University and then Texas A&M; University. Heady was one of the founders of the Society for Range Management (SRM) and at the SRM's January 1948 meeting became its first secretary–treasurer and in 1980 its president for a one-year term. He resigned from Texas A&M; and became in 1951 an assistant professor in the School of Forestry of U. C. Berkeley, where Harold H. Biswell (1905–1992) and Arnold M. Schultz (1920–2013), two of John Weaver's former doctoral students, were also on the faculty. Heady helped to develop range management programs at both the Davis campus and the Berkeley campus of the University of California. In 1965 the Interdepartmental Graduate Group in Range Management at Berkeley was established; Heady was the first chair of this group, and remained in that role until 1975. He authored or co-authored more than 150 journal articles, dealing with the ecology and management of California grasslands and various related subjects. He spent sabbaticals (supported by a Guggenheim Fellowship for 1958/59 and 2 Fulbright Fellowships) in Kenya, Saudi Arabia, and Australia. He retired from U.C. Berkeley in 1983 as professor emeritus. His first wife Eleanor Heady née Butler died in 1979 and his second wife Ruth Heady née Atkinson died in 2001.

These figurines measure anywhere from 4.6 cm to 8.8 cm when complete in form. Appearance and Construction Early figurative sculptures from Valdivia were vague outlines of human forms without gender or individualized features. As time went on, figurines were given more details and the signature coiffures of the Venus figurines as well as breasts or suggestions of pregnancy appeared. This higher level of detail was made possible when the carvers began to sculpt stone slabs and incise finer details into the figurines. Lewandowski, \\"Speaking through Stone: Ancient Voices of Ecuador and Colombia,\\" 52. The figurines are simple and compact in style with very few marks made to identify as facial features. Perhaps the most individualizing aspect of these figurines is the elaborate hairstyles for each individual figurine. Some hairstyles even eclipse other features of the woman such as her face and chin, clearly taking preference over other aspects of her form. Jones and Vogel, \\"Primitive Art,\\" 76. The construction of these figurines was as simple as their compact appearance. The women's body and head were formed by two coils, and then the larger details such as face, breasts, and arms were added with additional coils of clay. Gashes to mimic eyebrows, eyes, and a mouth were included while the clay was still wet. As a final step, the creators then waited for the material to dry and then added the coiffure hairdo. However, since the clay was almost completely dry at this point, the final hairpiece tended to fall off. Evans and Meggers, \\"Valdivia- an Early Formative Culture of Ecuador,\\" 180. Bisexuality in forms? While most figurines were obviously female with protruding breasts and feminine coiffures, a few figurines have \\"...a small conical projection...\\" in the pubic area. Some scholars such as Evans and Meggers suggest that this symbolizes bisexuality, and the inclusion of other female aspects such as curvy hips and large breasts supports this theory. Evans and Meggers, \\"Valdivia- an Early Formative Culture of Ecuador,\\" 181. Purpose While their true purpose remains elusive, scholars associate the Venus figurines with fertility and fertility rituals. However, it is possible to take this association a step further. Shamanistic Practices In Valdivian indigenous shamanistic practices, small human figurines are transformed into holy objects that possess the power to cure disease. Evans and Meggers, \\"Valdivia- an Early Formative Culture of Ecuador,\\" 180. It is possible that the Valdivian people may have created the figurines to \\"...serve a spiritual need, for a specific ritual or ceremonial event (most often assumed related to fertility), for a particular woman, or for the well-being of the home or community.\\" Lewandowski, \\"Speaking through Stone: Ancient Voices of Ecuador and Colombia,\\" 52. These Venus figurines could very well have been used in household ceremonies and then thrown out after the ritual ended, and their discovery \\"...in ancient refuse heaps indicate[s] that they would 'outlive' their usefulness and be discarded.\\" Jones and Vogel, \\"Primitive Art,\\" 76. This ritualistic treatment is common within Andean shaman practices where \\"...spirits vivify and inhabit effigies..\\" and \\"...it is likely that when women who had a ritual intervention successfully got pregnant, the vehicle was necessarily destroyed.\\" Stone, Art of the Andes: From Chávin to Inca, 24.

She was among the first class of women enrolled in Princeton University in 1969. Herman graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in English in 1973. She joined The New York Times in 1973 as its first female sports reporter. At the 1975 National Hockey League’s All-Star game in Montreal, she became the first female reporter to enter a male professional sports locker room. She has had a very successful and eclectic career, ranging from sports writing to assistant dean of communications for Harvard school of Public Health. She has been a writer for the New York Times, the Washington Post, has taught at Harvard, has had other high ranking positions at Harvard, and has published books on Renewable energy, as well as the need for equality.  Early life  Herman was born in 1951. She grew up in Port Washington, Long Island, New York. She attended Princeton University in 1969. She was among the first class of women admitted into Princeton University . She graduated from Princeton in 1973 Magna Cum Laude in the first graduating class of women in Princeton history. She was the first female staffer of the Daily Princetonian at her time at Princeton. She started out covering men’s rugby and went on to become the paper’s first female sports editor and later a managing editor.  Career  Herman became the first female sportswriter in the history of the New York Times upon graduation in 1973.  1975 NHL All-Star Game  Robin Herman and Marcel St. Cyr became the first women allowed in a men's professional locker room on January 21, 1975 at the 1975 NHL All-Star Game in Montreal, Canada. While the Wales All-Star team easily beat the Campbell Conference All-Star Game 7-1, Robin and Marcel instantly became the news, and television cameras swung to them. Despite Herman's efforts to sway the attention to the game, the story focused on women in the locker room. “Breaking the locker room barrier” was seen as a symbolic assault on traditional male privilege and power. As the only female member of the Professional Hockey Writers Association at the time, Herman stared down intimidation and eventually pried open the locker rooms of all but four NHL teams before leaving sports for political coverage in 1979.  Other journalism  In 1978, Herman left sports writing to become a political reporter for The New York Times. She was a political reporter for the Times for five years. In 1991 she wrote for the Washington Post and covered issues relating to health and medical fields.  Harvard  In 2000, Herman served as director of Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health'sHSPH official documents office of communications. In 2006 she became the Assistant Dean of Communications and would hold this position for four years. According to HSPH Dean Barry Bloom “Robin has provided an extraordinary level of service to the School community.”  Art  After 13 years at Harvard, Herman established a career in fine arts, painting in watercolor, acrylic and pastel. Her work can be viewed on her Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/RobinHermanArt/ and Instagram: @robinc_herman  Political views  Aside from writing for the Times as a political writer for five years, Herman currently writes about women’s issues, including sports, on Twitter @girlinthelocker and a website www.girlinthelockerroom.com. She stated that her idea for the blog started when George W. Bush ran for re-election in 2004. She stated “I felt that women’s rights and integrity were being undermined by the Bush administration and that younger women did not realize that their standing in society was being eroded.” “I wanted to voice a warning that they need to pay attention. I thought my experience as the ‘girl in the locker room’ was shorthand for the barriers we had to break and the case we had to make that we deserved equal opportunity and treatment in the spheres of employment and other rights.”  Published works  Herman wrote a history of science book “Fusion: The Search for Endless Energy.” (Cambridge University Press, 1990).  Awards  Herman is the 17th winner of the Mary Garber Pioneer award, Association of Women in Sports Media's highest honor. The award goes to a person showing distinguished work in the sports media industry and commitment to upholding and advancing the values of AWSM.

Beginning in January 1942 the SS conducted mass shooting actions at the Jewish cemetery in Opatów where the bodies of the Ghetto victims were also buried by the hundreds. History Initially, the Opatów Ghetto, set up by Nazi Germany in 1940, was an open type ghetto, along the Joselewicza, Zatylna, Wąska and Starowałowa Streets. The newly appointed German Kreishauptman Otto Ritter ordered all Christian Poles to relocate elsewhere from the area, and formed the Judenrat in order to help designate Jews ready for work. The new Jewish Ghetto Police (Judenpolizei) were moved to electric company building, dressed in uniforms of the Blue Police, and equipped with rubber truncheons. All stores were kept open, but food stamps were introduced to limit the distribution of regulated foods such as meat and grain. The ghetto population at the time was around 7,000 people. Expellees were brought in from smaller towns, but also from Vienna. Severe overcrowding led to steadily increasing number of deaths. Ghetto liquidation The Ghetto was closed off from the outside officially on 13 May 1942 in preparation for its eventual dismemberment. Several months later, on 20 October 1942 in the course of Operation Reinhard, the SS with the aid of Orpo police and Trawnikis rounded up 6,500 Jewish men, women and children in the centre of town at Targowica Square. They were marched some to the railway stop in Jasice in a one-kilometer-long column. The weakest furthest in the rear were beaten and shot by the dozen. The ghetto inmates were loaded onto the Holocaust train in Jasice, with 120 people in each boxcar fitted only with a bucket latrine.Joshua Brandt (April 22, 2005). \\"Holocaust survivor story\\". Jewish news weekly of Northern California. Retrieved 21 April 2015. The trip of less than 300 km took three days. During this time, they received no food or water. Those who managed to survive the transport to Treblinka extermination camp, died in its gas chambers shortly after arrival. Only one person from the Opatów trainset is known to have escaped death at Treblinka. Samuel Willenberg, 19 years old at the time, was spared by the SS and assigned to the Jewish Sonderkommando unit at the Camp 2 Auffanglager for the next several months. On August 2, 1943 Willenberg participated in the revolt at Treblinka. He was among about 200-300 prisoners who crossed the camp perimeter, chased by the SS in cars and on horses. Half of the Jews were caught and killed. Willenberg was one of about seventy insurgents who survived to the end of the war.Holocaust Encyclopedia (June 10, 2013), Treblinka: Chronology United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.

They were sent to other labour camps in 194344 including in Sandomierz, Starachowice and Radom, never to return. Some were sent to HASAG in Skarżysko- Kamienna (the total of 35,000 Jews perished at the HASAG camp before the war's end). Thus, the community was entirely eradicated. The German authorities in the town organized a fire sale of everything left behind in the abandoned ghetto. Impoverished Polish families took blankets, pillows and winter clothing to survive. Opatów was taken over by the Red Army on 16 January 1945.Overview: \\"Getta Żydowskie\\" by Gedeon and \\"Ghetto List\\" by Michael Peters. Only about 300 Jews are known to have survived. Among the Jews rescued in Opatów was the fourteen-year-old Rina Szydłowska, hidden for almost two years by Maria Zaleska, the Polish Righteous among the Nations recognized by Yad Vashem in 1987; as well as Israel and Franciszka Rubinek, rescued by Zofia Bania and her family, honoured posthumously in 2011.

Their motto is \\"Our People, Our Problem, Our Solution.' The Institute is very active in educating African American communities through their programs, like the Black Treatment Advocates Network and the African American HIV University. These two projects work with the communities to educate the people about the science of HIV, medical advancements, and prevention methods. The Institute has been received well through many other organizations providing funding to it. Some top funders include the Elton John AIDS Foundation, the Magic Johnson Foundation, Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS and more.  History  While white activists tended to target gay neighborhoods, Wilson decided to target the larger African-American community, since gay black men are \\"less likely to live in clusters and to seek gay services. In 1985, African-Americans accounted for a quarter of all new reported cases, and in 2001, they accounted for half. This is because black men are less likely to report that they have sex with other men. In a study done by the Centers for Disease Control in 2000, a quarter of black men who contracted HIV by having sex with another man considered themselves to be heterosexual, compared with 6% of white men. Wilson believes that AIDS is a black problem more than it is a gay problem. He has been cited as saying that he believes it is the black community's job to fight AIDS because \\"it is rarely possible for outsiders to come in and solve other peoples problems.\\" Wilson stepped down as President and CEO in 2019. He was replaced by Raniyah Copeland, who had joined the organization in 2008.  Activities  Black Treatment Advocates Network One of the projects done by The Institute is the Black Treatment Advocates Network (BTAN). It was launched in 2010, in a partnership with Merck, and it seeks to educate people about the science of HIV and the advances in medicine in the way of treatment, as well as prevention methods. As of 2013, BTAN had trained more than 1,000 advocates to provide support for people living with HIV in 13 cities across the United States.

Demetrius was a Greek Orthodox Christian boy born in Floka and raised in Ligouditsa, both in the region of Arcadia, near the regional capital of Tripoli. As with most of Greece at the time, the region was ruled by the Ottoman Empire. His mother died when he was very young, and his father, Elias, remarried. Due to ill-treatment by his stepmother, Demetrius left home and went to seek work in Tripoli, where he was apprenticed to a barber. He converted to Islam and took the name Mehmet, but later repented and became an Orthodox monk on the island of Chios. Demetrius fell into a deep depression when the weight of his sin fully weighed in and decided that to expiate his mistake, he must perform a great penance: returning to Tripoli to confess publicly that he was recanting his conversion to Islam. His abbot tried to dissuade him, to no avail, and Demetrius returned to Tripoli and publicly confessed his re-conversion to Christianity several times. This included him going to his former barber boss and asking him to slit his throat right there, which neither the boss nor the other barbers did. When this didn't work, he went up to the guards of a nearby leader and told them he had apostatized, which got him detained. Demetrius was taken to the presence of a Turkish judge, judged for apostasy from Islam, convicted and sentenced to die in 1803, despite the attempted intercession of a Turkish friend, who tried to cover up for him by altering the records of Demetrius' confession; Demetrius noticed this and demanded to be executed anyway, also ignoring the judge's own desire to let him go. Finally, Demetrius was taken to the local market (reportedly, he cheerfully sang Christian hymns in his way), and publicly executed by beheading; it took three strokes, and his severed head and body, though ordered to be burned, were hidden and preserved by local Christians as relics.

This allows the seal to accommodate a variable sealing gap. When pressure is applied internally to the seal, it inflates to conform to uneven surfaces and provides a reliable barrier from moisture, damp and other contaminants.  How It Works An inflatable seal can be moulded into a concave, flat or convoluted configuration. Once an inflatable medium is placed between the seal and the force, the seal expands and rounds out to create a firm barrier between a mounting and striking surface. The inflatable seal is uniquely designed to return to its original state once the source of inflation has been removed. This lets the technician move both the seal and the other object freely.  Applications  Inflatable seals can be utilized in an array of industries like electrical, environmental and the military to assist in the following applications to: # Squeeze to assist in the movement of materials # Produce a mechanical holding force # Stop equipment without damaging it # Push objects with any degree of force # Grip, hold, and lift objects while having the ability to retract the seal out of the way when deflated. # Seal off one environment Different seal profiles will be used depending on the application. Common profiles include Castellated Profiles, Frog-leg Profiles, Footed Snap Profiles, Stem/Foot Profiles and Channel-fit Profiles. The choice of profile depends on the speed with which the seal must be sealed and unsealed, the pressure it is expected to withstand, and the distance and shape of the sealing gap.  Materials Used  Many elastomers are combined to create an inflatable seal.

When Asa comes home with straight A's and hand-grown radishes in the first grade, he learns that his parents are getting a divorce. He moves with his mother to meet her boyfriend Dave, with whom he does not get along, due to Dave's being mean to him. They move to North Carolina to Dave's home. In the second story, he is in the fourth grade where he makes a lot of friends. His mother is now married to Dave, but Asa has difficulty accepting Dave as his stepfather. One day at school, Asa is assigned to recite a poem called \\"Little Blue Boy\\" with his friend Joel. He does not like the poem, so he plans to recite \\"The Highwayman.\\" Joel agrees to recite the longer, more difficult poem. At first, Joel is excited, but he has difficulty remembering the lines. Joel's mother and Asa agree on Asa's reciting the poem alone while Joel's mother takes him away, unaware of Asa's solo recitation. Joel shows up on the day of the recital, and Asa, for sake of his friendship, switches back to \\"Little Blue Boy,\\" which Joel remembers perfectly. Another turning point takes place when Asa is eleven. He tries out for Little League Baseball after practicing with his stepfather and his mother for weeks. A day before his tryout, his mother has an accident with pills. It is later revealed that his mother is suffering from depression. The family moves to Raleigh, and Asa misses his chance to play baseball. In the fourth story, Asa is in love with Jean, his classmate since the fifth grade whom he finally befriends in the seventh grade. Asa confesses his love to Jean and just as he reaches home that day, he learns that he and his mother are moving, due to his mother's separation from Dave. The next day, Jean confesses her love to Asa by giving him two candy hearts that say \\"I love you, I love you,\\" only to find out that Asa would no longer be with her. Asa later calls Jean on the phone but Jean pretends as if nothing has happened between them. When Asa mentions the heart candies, Jean asks, \\"What Hearts?\\" Asa realizes the world is ever changing, and that he has to learn to adjust with it.

Jones published his first novel, The Long Dry, in 2006. In 2010 he published Le Cose Che Non Vogliamo Più (Things We Don't Want Anymore) in Italian. He later published three novels between 2011 and 2014. In autumn 2016, Cove became his sixth published work. His work has been translated into other languages, and his short stories have appeared in a number of anthologies and publications like Granta and New Welsh Review. The story A Glass of Cold Water aired on BBC Radio 4 in May 2014. Jones has been noted as an author and received some awards. In October 2017, he won the £15,000 BBC National Short Story Award for The Edge of the Shoal. Early career Jones was born near Aberaeron, Ceredigion. The Long Dry, his first novel, was awarded a 2007 Betty Trask Award. In 2008, the author himself was named as the Hay Festival Scritture Giovani. A chapter from The Dig, first published in Granta Magazine, was shortlisted for the 2013 Sunday Times EFG Private Bank Short Story Award. The Dig, his most recent novel, won a 2014 Jerwood Fiction Uncovered Prize and the 2015 Wales Book of the Year Fiction Prize. That novel was also on the longlist for the 2014 Kirkus Prize in the US and the 2014 Warwick Prize for Writing. Writing In an interview with Cynan Jones about The Dig, the author spoke about \\"triggering reactions [in the reader], without being overtly shocking.\\" He also explained his use of more poetic language for some characters over others to keep them apart or \\"mirror\\" an aspect of their character. In using \\"physical and natural allegories\\" to say things about people, the reader should \\"understand the reference instinctively.\\" He mentioned writing like \\"Steinbeck, for example, with The Long Dry\\". In another interview, Jones addressed the idea that there is \\"a natural allegory in the center of [his books] that really informs the human situation\\". He says to \\"trust the readers\\" so that you can do or say things that will \\"draw the reader's eye\\" and you don't have to \\"build narratives\\" that are more like \\"writing by numbers\\". When asked about \\"the saccharine and the violent\\" that a lot of literature avoids, Jones said that he trusts the reader to have an understanding of the \\"innate\\" nature of a situation and all he has to do is \\"write it down as clearly as I can, and without judgement\\", more like a witness than a voyeur. In 2014, Jones made headlines for not punctuating most of the speech in his novel The Dig (and a few other short stories). His characters' speech and ideas had been delineated through quotation marks (inverted commas) until John Freeman, an editor at the magazine Granta, took a chance and removed the speech marks to be \\"more immediate, more with it\\". The author agreed on the impact of this unconventional device and finished the rest of the book this way, save for one conversation between the protagonist and his mother. In that passage, Jones used traditional speech marks \\"to create a sense of a more conventional, staid dialogue.\\" Writers like Cormac McCarthy, James Joyce, and Samuel Beckett have experimented with this same lack of punctuation. By doing so, Jones went against a convention that has predominated since at least the late 18th century. Bibliography *The Long Dry.

Early Life/Education  Raimi Merritt was born on April 12, 1993 in Lantana, FL. She is the daughter of Gina Merritt, and Steve Merritt who is a former world champion barefoot water skier. Raimi is the youngest daughter of 3 other siblings. Growing up she attended kindergarten in a regular school, but that is the only year she attended in a regular school. After that, she was homes-schooled through her senior year of high school. Being home schooled allowed her to travel the world with her family. It also helped advance her wakeboarding career by having the chance to wakeboard every day and participating in many tournaments around the world that she otherwise would not have been able to go to. Since she graduated high school, she is currently taking college courses to obtain a business degree.  Wakeboarding career  Raimi Merritt first fell in love with wakeboarding when she was 9 years old and started participating in amateur tournaments by the time she was 11 years old. She won her first ever tournament that she entered in. When she started winning most of the amateur tournaments she participated in, she realized how great she was in the sport. In 2007, and by the age of only 15 years old, she had turned pro. When she turned pro, she moved to Orlando, FL to live with her older sister, Mia to continue training with her coach, Glen Fletcher, who is a former pro wakebaorder. In 2008, only one year after Raimi turned pro she was named Queen of Wake's \\"Rookie of the Year\\", and won her first world championship title in that year. After that she was named female rider of the year from 2009-2013. Since then, she has gone on to win 10 world championship titles with her last one being in Linyi, China in 2014 at the Water Ski and Wakeboard Federation's Wakeboard World Cup. She surprised everyone with this win, after being out for most of the 2014 season due to injury, she was cleared shortly before the tournament and ended up winning even in rough conditions. She has now won more world cup titles than any other female in wakeboarding history. She first gained real popularity in the sport because she was the first female rider ever to land an \\"s-bend\\" (wakeboarding trick which is a raley with a 360 degree overhead rotation) behind a boat. Others had landed it in a cable park, but it is much more difficult to do behind a boat because of the lower angle of the rope. Since then, she has gone on to land many other tricks that other females have not been able to in the past. Her daredevil instincts have also landed her many injuries, but that hasn't stopped her. She has suffered injuries such as torn biceps, a dislocated kneecap, and two broken ankles. Her coach, Fletcher, said that at one tournament, she had an ankle injury that she probably shouldn't have been riding on in the first place, but she wanted to go so bad that when she couldn't find her tape for her ankle, she ended up taping her ankle in duct tape.

It has received attention as a paradoxical form of assimilation by embracing an unfamiliar cuisine that eased the consumption of non-kosher foods. Factors might include the relative absence of dairy products compared with European cuisine, concern over German and Italian antisemitic regimes in the 1930s and the proximity of Jewish and Chinese immigrants to each other in New York City. The American Jewish habit of eating at Chinese restaurants on Christmas or Christmas Eve is a common stereotype portrayed in film and television, but has a factual basis. The tradition may have arisen from the lack of other open restaurants on Christmas Day. Historical background A common stereotype, the relationship Jewish people have with Chinese restaurants during Christmas is well documented. The definitive scholarly and popular treatment of this subject appears in the book A Kosher Christmas: 'Tis the Season to Be Jewish by Rabbi Joshua Eli Plaut, Ph.D. in the third chapter entitled \\"We Eat Chinese Food on Christmas.\\"Plaut, Joshua, A Kosher Christmas, 'Tis the Season to Be Jewish,\\" Chapter 3: \\"We Eat Chinese Food on Christmas,\\" pages 65-86. The origin of Jews eating Chinese food dates to the end of the 19th century on the Lower East Side, Manhattan, because Jews and the Chinese lived in proximity to each other. There were around a million Eastern European Jews living in New York around 1910 and the Jews constituted over \\"one quarter of the city’s population.\\" The majority of the Chinese immigrated to the Lower East Side from California after the 1880s and many of them went into the restaurant business. The first mention of the Jewish population eating Chinese food was in 1899 in the American Hebrew Weekly journal. They criticized Jews for eating at non-kosher restaurants, particularly singling out Chinese food. Jews continued to eat at these establishments. In 1936, it was reported that there were eighteen Chinese restaurants open in heavily populated Jewish areas in the Lower East Side. Jews felt more comfortable at these restaurants than they did at the Italian or German eateries that were prevalent during this time period. Joshua Plaut wrote of the origin of Jews eating Chinese food on Christmas: \\"It dates at least as early as 1935 when The New York Times reported a certain restaurant owner named Eng Shee Chuck who brought chow mein on Christmas Day to the Jewish Children’s Home in Newark. Over the years, Jewish families and friends gather on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day at Chinese restaurants across the United States to socialize and to banter, to reinforce social and familiar bonds, and to engage in a favorite activity for Jews during the Christmas holiday. The Chinese restaurant has become a place where Jewish identity is made, remade and announced.\\" Reasons for appeal of Chinese food for Jews In lower Manhattan, immigrant Jews would open delis for other Jews, Italians ran restaurants primarily for other Italians, and Germans had many places that would serve only Germans, but Chinese restaurant owners \\"accept[ed] Jews and other immigrant and ethnic groups as customers without precondition.\\" More of the Jews and Italians would want to eat at Chinese restaurants than they would want to eat at their own ethnic restaurants. Chinese restaurateurs' lack of anti-Semitism gave Jews a sense of security, and they were also drawn to the restaurants' exoticism. \\"Of all the peoples whom immigrant Jews and their children met, of all the foods they encountered in America, the Chinese were the most foreign, the most 'un-Jewish'.\\" A large majority of the Jews saw \\"eating in Chinese restaurants as an antidote for Jewish parochialism, for the exclusive and overweening emphasis on the culture of the Jews as it had been.\\" Many of the people whom Tuchman and Levine spoke to felt that eating in a place that was \\"un-Jewish\\" showed that they could be \\"somewhat sophisticated, urbane New Yorkers.\\" The restaurants had unusual wallpaper, eccentric decorations, chopsticks, and exotic food names. The generations of Jews who grew up in New York after the initial Eastern European Jews immigrated wanted their identity to be based on cosmopolitan ideals. Chinese food and kosher law Chinese food allowed Jews to transition from strict kosher to incorporating non-kosher foods into their diets. Chinese cuisine is \\"unusually well suited to Jewish tastes because, unlike virtually any other cuisine available in America, traditional Chinese cooking rarely uses milk products.\\" While most first-generation Jews living in America strictly practiced kashrut at all times, many second-generation Jews remained strict in their home observance but became more flexible in the foods they ate outside the home. The nature of Chinese food allowed them to rationalize this decision, as it is \\"disguised through a process of cutting, chopping and mincing. Pork, shrimp, lobster, and other so-called dietary abominations are no longer viewed in their more natural states.\\" This process of cutting, chopping, and mincing, referred to as \\"ko p'eng—'to cut and cook'\\" in ancient Chinese texts, made the ingredients invisible and thus safe treyf. For instance, pork was hidden and wrapped in wontons that looked similar to Jewish kreplach (dumplings). Ultimately this gave way to many US-born Jews rejecting kashrut altogether as \\"impractical and anachronistic\\". Breaking the rules of kashrut by eating Chinese food allowed the younger generation to assert their independence and further established a \\"cosmopolitan spirit\\". Among Orthodox Jewish communities in America, Chinese restaurants which fully follow Kashruth laws do exist, and are under strict Rabbinical Supervision. Cultural significance The relationship that Jews have with Chinese food runs deeper than stereotype. \\"Eating Chinese [food] has become a meaningful symbol of American Judaism… For in eating Chinese, the Jews found a modern means of expressing their traditional cultural values. The savoring of Chinese food is now a ritualized celebration of immigration, education, family, community, and continuity.\\" Chinese food is considered a staple in the Jewish culture, and the further option of kosher Chinese food is also becoming more available in the US. Michael Tong of Shun Lee Palace talked about the issue in a 2003 interview with The New York Times: > Welcome to the conundrum that is Christmas New York style: while most > restaurants close for the holiday, or in a few cases, stay open and serve a > prix fixe meal laden with froufrou, thousands of diners, most of them > Jewish, are faced with a dilemma. There's nothing to celebrate at home and > no place to eat out, at least if they want a regular dinner. That leaves > Chinese restaurants...

The book is a loose autobiographical account of Bell's childhood and living with her deafness. However, the characters in the book are all bunnies. Cece Bell, in an interview with the Horn Book Magazine, states \\"What are bunnies known for? Big ears; excellent hearing,\\" rendering her choice of characters and their deafness ironic. Plot The book depicts the childhood of Cece Bell, who required the assistance of a Phonic Ear hearing aid while she was growing up to be the person who she is now. While the hearing aid enables her to hear the world around her, it also distances her from some children her own age because she is seen as \\"different\\". This causes both frustration and depression in Cece, as she is desperate to find a true friend but frequently feels that she has to accept poor treatment from others being afraid of losing what few friends she has. She deals with these feelings by treating her hearing aid as a superpower, as it gives her the ability to hear everything. For example, she hears private teacher conversations, as her teachers wear a tiny microphone that transmits sound to Cece's hearing aid; and not every teacher remembers to turn it off when they leave the classroom. She adopts the secret nickname \\"El Deafo\\". As time passes Cece grows more assertive and opens up to the people around her, especially when she meets a new friend who doesn't seem to care that she wears a hearing aid. She also grows comfortable in confronting people that treat her differently because of her deafness, finding that many of them are largely unaware that their actions cause her emotional harm. Ultimately Cece opens up to her new friend and reveals her secret persona as \\"El Deafo\\", much to the delight of her friend, who agrees to serve as her sidekick. As she gets older, she realizes that she no longer has to hide her \\"superpower\\" with others.

As an endurance athlete, Gash focuses on long distance expedition runs and adventure races. She is an ambassador to numerous organizations and events including World Vision, Lululemon Athletica, Run Melbourne and Travel Play Live. Career Endurance running In 2010 at the age of 25, Gash became the first woman and youngest person at the time to complete the Four Deserts Grandslam, four 250 km desert ultramarathons completed in four deserts in the world (Atacama, Gobi, Sahara, Antarctic) in one calendar year. At the time only two male athletes had completed this challenge. Gash and three other ultra-marathoners were the subjects of the 2013 documentary film called Desert Runners, which followed their journey throughout the four races and looked at the mindset of endurance athletes.  Social change projects  Gash has used her ability to run long and connect it to social change projects that link to female empowerment and access to education programs. In 2012, Gash ran 379 km non- stop across Australia's Simpson Desert. She raised around $32,991 to fund a Save the Children education initiative in Australia. In 2014, Gash collaborated with UK ultra-runner Mimi Anderson and together they founded Freedom Runners. It was an initiative that combined a fundraising and awareness campaign around the high cost of feminine hygiene products for women in Sub-Saharan Africa and its link to female absenteeism in school. Over 32 days they ran 1,968 km across South Africa’s Freedom Trail and raised over $55K for a Save the Children program. They ran an average of 64 km every day and had no rest days. In 2016, Gash became a World Vision Ambassador and collaborated with the not-for-profit on a concept to run from the West to East of India and use it as a means to explore the barriers to quality education. The campaign was called Run India and raised over $150,000 to support six World Vision education focused programs across the country. Gash, as the solo runner supported by a crew, ran 3,253 km over 76 days, visiting 16 communities that World Vision support. This included visits to schools, a malnutrition clinic and a self defence program in the urban slums; economic development projects in the Himalayas and home visits in the desert.  Professional and speaking career  Gash worked as a lawyer at international law firm Baker & McKenzie for just under a year, later working in a boutique financial advisory firm owned by one of her friends (Wealth Enhancers) and in communications. She is now a motivational speaker on the speaker circuit, currently writing her first book with Macmillan Roaring Brook Press.

This shell-less mollusc is found in tropical and sub-tropical waters in the epipelagic zone of the world's oceans. Taxonomy Both genus and species were first described in 1817 by the French artist and naturalist Charles Alexandre Lesueur. He named the species in honour of the French zoologist Anselme Gaëtan Desmarest but made an error in spelling the specific name and called the mollusc F. demarestia. Subsequent authors corrected this to F. desmarestia, but according to the rules of precedence of scientific names, the misspelling should stand. However the ICZN determined that F. desmarestia was preferable and substituted it for the original name. Description Firoloida desmarestia has a proboscis, a long, transparent cylindrical body and a short, ventral tail. It has a large, rounded swimming fin, situated towards the front of the mollusc, and the opaque visceral nucleus, a mass which includes the liver, heart, gonad, sexual glands and kidneys, at the rear. Males have a sucker on the front edge of the fin, large tentacles in front of the eyes, and a tail filament, while females lack the sucker and tentacles, and have a string of eggs trailing behind them. Distribution Firoloida desmarestia is found in warm oceanic waters and is of cosmopolitan distribution. It has been collected from the upper of the sea and it seems to be uncommon in the north Central Atlantic Ocean, more plentiful in the Indian Ocean and rare in the northern Pacific Ocean around Hawaii. Biology The sexes are separate in Firoloida desmarestia. A string of eggs in varying stages of development trail behind the female. Newly fertilised eggs are close to the visceral nucleus while veliger larvae, complete with a shell of two whorls and a rounded aperture, are at the far end and eventually become detached. All stages of this mollusc are planktonic.

When she was 15 and living in Detroit, Flores was allegedly drugged and raped by a male classmate at Birmingham Groves High School. The rapist's older cousins had taken pictures of the attack, and used it for sexual blackmail that lasted two years.

Author name disambiguation is a type of disambiguation and record linkage applied to the names of individual people. The process could, for example, distinguish individuals with the name \\"John Smith\\". An editor may apply the process to scholarly documents where the goal is to find all mentions of the same author and cluster them together. Authors of scholarly documents often share names which makes it hard to distinguish each author's work. Hence, author name disambiguation aims to find all publications that belong to a given author and distinguish them from publications of other authors who share the same name. Methods Considerable research has been conducted to do disambiguation. Typical approaches for author name disambiguation rely on information about the authors such as their affiliations, email addresses, year of publication, co-authors, topic information to distinguish between authors. This information can be used to train a machine learning classifier to decide whether two author mentions refer to the same author or not. Many research works regard name disambiguation as a clustering problem, i.e., partitioning documents into some clusters, where each represents an author. Some works construct document graph and utilize the graph topology to learn document similarity. Recently, several research works aim to learn low-dimensional document representation by employing network embedding methods. Applications Some of the ways in which authorship has been indicated for the same person There are multiple reasons that cause author names to be ambiguous, among which: individuals may publish under multiple names for a variety of reasons including different transliteration, misspelling, name change due to marriage, or the use of nicknames or middle names and initials. Motivations for disambiguating individuals include identifying inventors from patents. Name disambiguation is also a cornerstone in author-centric academic search and mining systems, such as ArnetMiner (also AMiner) . Similar issues Author name disambiguation is only one record linkage problem in the scholarly data domain. Closely related, and potentially mutually beneficial problems include: organisation (affiliation) disambiguation, as well as conference or publication venue disambiguation, since data publishers often use different names or aliases for these entities. Resources Several well-known benchmarks to evaluate author name disambiguation are listed below, each of which provides publications with some ambiguous names and their ground truths. * AMiner name disambiguation dataset * CiteSeerX name disambiguation dataset Source Codes * Beard * Name disambiguation in AMiner References Word-sense disambiguation Library cataloging and classification Metadata Data management ","title":"Author name disambiguation"},{"id":"46474413","title":"Alexandria Fire Department"},{"id":"46474421","text":"Lieutenant Colonel Michael \\"Zak\\" Franzak (Ret.) is an American writer.

This realistic fiction book was published in the year 2000 and describes the challenging life of young Joey suffering from an attention deficit disorder.http://www.scholastic.com/teachers/book/joey-pigza-loses- control#cart/cleanuphttp://www.kidsreads.com/reviews/joey-pigza-loses-control Plot Joey Pigza Loses Control is the story of a young boy suffering from the widely known Attention Deficit hyperactivity disorder. (ADHD) The fiction book begins with Joey and his mother and dog's road trip traveling to his father's home where he is eager and nervous for what the next six weeks with his Dad, will have in store for him. After not seeing his father for many years, Joey's questions regarding his concerns towards his father, become endless. This array of questions in the form of “What If’s” that Joey bases his questions on, allows readers a full on experience into the mind of a young boy suffering from ADHD. Joey's mother, who is clearly highly impacted by her son's disorder answers Joey's questions vaguely and occasionally, portraying a sense of impatience and relief about Joey's upcoming six week stay with his father. During the road trip, Joey wonders about all kinds of things revolving around what to expect from his dad. He was extremely impatient and nervous but one thing was for sure, it was comforting to know that his mother's own worries about Joey's father were consuming her thoughts so profoundly, it no longer seemed like Joey and his condition were the only thing on her mind, something that he had become quite accustomed to. Now finding a suitable medicine in the form of an arm patch for Joey's ADHD, Joey was able to \\"settle down and think.\\" And not just think about all the bad things that had already happened. He started thinking about the good things I wanted to happen. Joey's life takes a major turn when he finally meets his father and feels a sense of familiarity with himself, before the meds, before being placed in the special education classes, his old hyperactive self. Carter, Joey's father, makes it the summers duty to make up for the time he was absent in his son's life. Carter teaches Joey the importance of taking control over his own life, and how to be a true winner. Carter Pigza takes the first step in helping his son take control, by flushing down Joey's ADHD medication down the toilet. As nervous and hesitant as Joey was to “take control” over his own life, Joey followed his father's guidance willingly. The conflict between Joey's approach at taking control over his life, and trying to please his father is what this novel is based upon. Joey becomes increasingly fearful that things will go wrong like they did in the past, and although just a young boy, his father makes dangerous decisions. Joey slowly but surely loses control over his behavior and feelings without his medication arm patch, and finds his voice throughout the novel.

Plot In the study room, the Save Greendale Committee are going over plans for the upcoming alumni dance. Next on the agenda is Chang's Power Point presentation followed by Frankie's lecture on Guerrilla Marketing. It's a sales technique which is now a problem at Greendale evidenced by Pelton who announces his need to buy a Honda. Once the meeting ends, Elroy quickly leaves and Chang suggests it's because he hasn't found his role in the group yet. This leads to everyone commenting on how much they miss Troy. Frankie asks why he was special and Jeff tells her he played the steel drums. Later in the hallway, Annie warns Britta that her boyfriend from season three's \\"Digital Exploration of Interior Design\\" (Travis Schuldt) is in the schools parking lot. Britta rushes off to see him and finds that he's still a corporate tool except this time he's working for Honda. He cuts short a presentation he was giving and reintroduces himself to Britta as \\"Rick\\". Although he claims to be here for her she realizes his main purpose is sell his company's brand. Britta watches Rick convince Dean Pelton to upgrade a new Honda he bought for a more expensive vehicle. Despite her disgust, she ends up joining Rick in the backseat of his car. Over at Jeff's office, Annie and Abed tell Jeff about their plan to befriend Elroy. He accepted an invitation to join them in playing a '90s board game called \\"The Ears Have It\\". Back in the parking lot, Rick and Britta's afterglow is interrupted by Dean Pelton. Rick asks Britta to hide while he deals with Craig who just made multiple Honda purchases. While Rick is distracted by the \\"level seven susceptible\\", Britta exits the car and storms off. Over in the study room Jeff finds Annie, Abed and Chang playing a spirited game and enjoying each other's company. Elroy leaves upon his arrival which Chang points out and has Abed speculating that he doesn't like Jeff. At \\"The Vatican\\", Britta is tending bar when a customer shows up. She convinces him to buy scotch only to learn he's in cahoots with Rick who enters the bar. Rick introduces his Honda boss and proposes that Britta becomes his marketing partner. Although this will allow them to be a couple in public, Britta is reluctant to force people to buy unnecessary things. Ricks boss points out she already does this by bringing up the scotch Britta got him to buy. Britta accepts their offer and seals the deal by kissing Rick. The next day the new couple are in the cafeteria and together convince Todd to consider buying a Honda. Annie, Abed, Chang and Elroy are seated at a table nearby watching the pair in amusement. When Jeff tries to join them Elroy gets up to leave. Before he goes, Abed gives Elroy an exclusive CD of his favorite band \\"Natalie Is Freezing\\" which Jeff makes sure to remember. Elsewhere, Frankie stops by Dean Pelton's office and finds him surrounded by an overwhelming amount of Honda products. Once Frankie scolds Pelton for his gullibility he breaks down crying and she tries to comfort him. That night, Britta brings Rick over to her parents' house for dinner. Things go well until Rick starts to covertly sell George and Deb on Honda vehicles. Back at school, the committee is finishing the alumni dance decorations in the cafeteria. Jeff shows up and announces he booked the band \\"Natalie is Freezing\\" for the event which infuriates Elroy. He calls Jeff out on his obvious attempts to win his favor and leaves just as the band arrives. Meanwhile, Britta and Rick argue as they drive home from her parents' house. She's upset he's always on the job and he's frustrated she can't understand that's who he is. Britta demands to be let out of the car and makes her way back to the Vatican for another shift. Elroy shows up for a drink at the bar and tells her their favorite band is playing at Greendale. He admits he dated the lead singer Julie (Lisa Loeb) which ended so poorly he hasn't let anyone close to him since. Britta sympathizes but advises him against shutting everyone out. Rick then appears and declares that he'll quit his job for Britta. They go to the dance where Rick overhears Frankie mentioning the Dean wanting to buy a fleet of vehicles. Over Britta's protestations, Rick leaves to do one last big score. In the Student lounge, Elroy gets some closure when he tells Julie how much she hurt him and also manages to make up with Jeff. Meanwhile, Britta finds out Rick was set up by Pelton and Frankie. As security escorts Rick off campus his Honda boss tries and fails to comfort Britta. Afterwards, the committee attends the concert and sees Frankie on stage playing the steel drums. Elroy and Jeff later share a drink at the bar as Britta sadly cleans some glasses. Somewhere far away, Rick is driving his Honda as tears fall from his eyes. Cultural references Britta disagrees with Rick over the quality of the film Avatar. Later Britta and Rick discuss the film Chariots of Fire, with Rick quoting a line in the film, \\"When I run, I feel His pleasure.\\" Production In February 2015, it was reported that Travis Schuldt would return to the series as Subway/Rick, and that Billy Zane would also make a guest appearance as a character who wanted to recruit Britta for her unique abilities. During the episode various scenes were shot outdoors on the CBS Studio City backlot. Critical reception Alan Sepinwall of HitFix points to the moment in this episode when \\"Frankie tried to console the Dean even as she was calling him stupid,\\" as \\"a nice moment\\" for Paget Brewster's character. Joshua Alston from The A.V. Club found that the episode \\"captures Community's themes so perfectly, it's comforting even when it isn't bringing the laughs,\\" and found, \\"Frankie turning the Dean into her lapdog to help take down Rick for his shady salesmanship,\\" one of the funniest parts of the story. He also reminds us that \\"there are limits to how deftly a show can overtly integrate advertising,\\" reminding us that the overt product integration is ridiculously funny. Eric Goldman of IGN mentions, \\"Chang’s PowerPoint presentation got funnier and funnier as it went on,\\" and points to Jeff's realization that someone doesn't like him, as another facet of the episode's story-line that made this episode especially good. In Yahoo's Robert Chan weekly Postmortem with Communitys Dan Harmon, Robert says, \\"nobody's cooler than Keith David.\\" For the first time the character of Elroy becomes integral to the episode's story-line. At the same time Harmon cautions the relevance of other established series regulars, like Alison Brie's character of Annie, which in this episode seems to have faded into the background.

She never suffered any sexual harassment, only sexual discrimination because of the policies that barred women from fighting alongside men on the ground. After graduating, she served with the 330th Army Security Agency Company (Guardrail II) flying RU-21 airplanes as an intelligence officer along the border between Germany and the Soviet Union. Later she flew Huey helicopters and commanded a company for the 1st Infantry Division at Fort Riley, Kansas for 4 years. She returned to Germany and in 1986 was assigned commander of the 62nd Aviation Company (The Coachmen) in support of V Corps headquarters. In 1991, Murphy was assigned to the 78th Aviation Battalion at Camp Zama, Japan. Under her command, the unit flew and maintained UH-1 and UH-60 (Sikorsky Blackhawk) helicopters and C-12 (Beechcraft King Air) airplanes. At the rank of major, Murphy served in the Headquarters, Department of the Army, Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations, Force Development office for intelligence systems, including her responsibility for the Army's unmanned aerial vehicle program. She wrote, staffed, and received approval for the first Joint requirements document plan for unmanned aerial vehicles, its master plan. After 27 years of service, Murphy retired as a colonel in 1999 and received the U.S. Army Freedom Team Salute Veteran Commendation . In March 2009, she was honored at a ceremony at Fort Myer in Arlington County, Virginia. During the service, she was lauded as a groundbreaker who made progressing through the army easier for the women who followed her.  Personal life  Stonecipher's first marriage ended in divorce. Four days after graduating from flight school as Sally Woolfolk, she married a combat Huey helicopter pilot who had served in Vietnam and became Sally Murphy. In February 1980 they had a son, a captain with the 82nd Airborne Division who deployed once to Afghanistan and once to Iraq. He died after his parachute failed during a 2009 training mission in North Carolina. Her daughter-in-law is also a soldier and has served two tours in Iraq.

In 1890 the church underwent a restoration which comprised putting in new windows, cleaning, painting, varnishing the interior, and installing a new heating apparatus by Ellis Outram of Holmesfield. The foundation stone was laid by Mrs W.A. Milner for the construction of the chancel on 11 April 1898. It cost £725 and it was opened by the Bishop of Southwell on 12 September 1898. At the same time a new oak pulpit was given in memory of Mrs. Roberts of Queen's Tower, Sheffield, and a new font was provided by Mrs. George Greaves of Sheffield, and Mr and Mrs Goodliffe of Norton provided a chandelier for the chancel. Unfortunately, some of the work in the new chancel was defective and two months later the cross on the chancel was blown down in a heavy gale of wind.

Early life Raissa Berg was born in St. Petersburg, the second child of Lev Semenovitch Berg and Polina Abramovna Kotlovker, both natives of Bendery, within the Jewish Pale. In order to study at Moscow University, Lev Berg chose to convert to Lutheranism and became a noted geographer and ichthyologist.Elena Aronova, \\"Raissa L'vovna Berg,\\" Jewish Women's Archive, http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/berg-raissa-lvovna (accessed 21 April 2015); V. V. Tikhomirov, \\"Berg, Lev Simonovich,\\" Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography (2008), Encyclopedia.com (accessed April 27, 2015). When Raissa Berg was six weeks old, her parents separated. Though her mother sued for custody, her father prevailed; he was a Christian and the Russian Orthodox Church decided such cases. Raissa and her brother Simon were baptized and raised by their father, paternal grandmother Klara L'vovna Berg, and stepmother Maria Mikhailovna Ivanova, who Lev Berg married in 1923.Aronova. Education Berg graduated from St. Petersburg's German Lutheran school in 1929. She then earned a diploma in genetics from Leningrad University, where she studied under H. J. Muller. With the dissertation \\"Differences between wild and laboratory populations of Drosophila melanogaster: a hypothesis of genetic correlations,\\" she earned a Candidate of Sciences degree from Leningrad State University. She began work on a doctoral dissertation, \\"Species as an Evolving System,\\" in the early 1940s and officially defended it in 1964, earning a Doctor of Sciences degree from Novosibirsk's Institute of Cytology and Genetics.Aronova. Scientific career After completing her studies in Leningrad, Berg moved to Moscow to work at the A. N. Severtsov Institute of Evolutionary Morphology under I. I. Schmalhausen. The Institute was evacuated to Kazakhstan in 1941, but the following year Berg returned to Moscow to work on her doctoral dissertation.Aronova. From 1944-1947 she worked as a senior researcher at the Severtsov Institute and part-time at the Zoological Institute of Moscow University.Finding aid, Raisa Berg papers, 1898-2006, Columbia University Libraries, http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/archival/collections/ldpd_6761446/ (accessed 21 April 2015). Lysenkoism pressured Soviet geneticists, pushing many researchers out of their institutions. By the time of Berg's dismissal from Moscow University, \\"there was only one geneticist at Moscow University's Department of Darwinism and one geneticist at the Institute of Evolutionary Morphology, and I was both of them.\\" Berg continued botanical experiments to support her doctoral dissertation and published work relating to her father's expeditions.Aronova, quoting Berg. In 1948, Berg began work as an associate professor of the Herzen Leningrad Pedagogical Institute, and in 1949 moved to the All-Union Research Institute of Lake and River Fish Management. She then worked at Leningrad State University; between 1954-1963 she was an assistant, then associate professor, and finally senior research associate. From 1964–1968, Berg headed the Laboratory of Population Genetics of the Institute of Cytology and Genetics and worked as a lecturer at Novosibirsk State University.Finding aid. After being forced out of Novosibirsk in 1968, Berg returned to Leningrad. She headed a group at the Agrophysical Institute of VASKhNIL from 1968-1970 and was a professor at Herzen Leningrad Pedagogical University from 1968–1974.Finding aid. In the mid-1970s, Berg emigrated to the United States. She held a position at the University of Wisconsin–Madison from 1975–1981, and from 1984-1984 was a visiting professor at George Washington University. She traveled and lectured extensively before relocating to France in 1994.Aronova, Finding aid. Political opinions Berg was a non- conformist. The comparatively liberal Khrushchev regime and remote Novosibirsk Akademgorodok afforded her the opportunity to host gatherings of dissenter artists and writers.Aronova. Along with several dozen other researchers working within the Siberian Division of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Berg signed a letter protesting the closed trials of dissidents. In 1968 she was condemned for \\"political irresponsibility\\" and retired from her work.Finding aid. Berg wrote in defense of N. V. Timoféeff-Ressovsky, a Russian-born scientist working in Nazi Germany. She asserted that he was interested in pure research, politically opposed to the Third Reich, reasonably concerned for his safety in Stalin's Soviet Union, and unfairly persecuted following World War II.Raissa L. Berg, \\"In Defense of Timoféeff-Ressovsky,\\" The Quarterly Review of Biology, Vol. 65, No. 4 (December 1990): 457-479, http://lysvav.narod.ru/Files/V.pdf (accessed 21 April 2015), esp. 459-460, 466-467. In her memoir, Acquired Traits, Berg chronicled her own challenges working within the Soviet system.Yakov M. Rabkin, review of Acquired Traits: Memoirs of a Geneticist in the Soviet Union, Los Angeles Times, August 21, 1988, http://articles.latimes.com/1988-08-21/books/bk-1285_1_soviet-union (accessed 21 April 2015).
