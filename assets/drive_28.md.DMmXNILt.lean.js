He later formed a jazz group and worked for the South African broadcasting corporation. He once said, \\"The message here for students and young people is to never give up. With passion and hard work, success can be yours no matter what the challenge.\\"  Career  Darryl Andrews played lead guitar in club bands like \\"Missing Link\\", \\"Big Daddy\\", \\"Zig Zag\\", \\"Makhoi\\", \\"The Buttercups\\" and \\"Mahogany\\" in the early to mid 1970s. He then toured the international hotel circuit, honing his skills in reading and writing music. He returned to Cape Town in 1989 to form the groundbreaking Jazz/Funk band \\"MJ9\\" and worked as musical director/composer/arranger at the S.A.B.C. Studios in Sea Point. In 1990 he conducted 62 performances of the hit musical \\"Guys & Dolls\\" at the Baxter Theatre after which he taught as a leave replacement to Andrew Lilley in the Jazz Studies Programme at the University of Cape Town. He accepted a full-time post as lecturer in Jazz Studies, where he still teaches today. He has performed in Port Elizabeth, East London, Durban, Johannesburg, Lesotho, Swaziland, Botswana, Namibia, Mozambique, Ghana, Tanzania, Malaysia, Finland, Estonia, Germany and China and has worked with many international stars including Peter Sarstaedt, Ben E.

He became an influential art teacher. He was one of the first British artists to be influenced by the French Impressionists; he exhibited with the New English Art Club, and was an associate of many of the more progressive artists of late Victorian Britain, including James McNeill Whistler, Walter Sickert, John Singer Sargent and George Clausen. Early life and career as a surgeon Tonks was born in Solihull. His family owned a brass foundry in Birmingham. He was educated briefly at Bloxham School, followed by Clifton College in Bristol, and then studied medicine at the Royal Sussex County Hospital in Brighton (1882‚Äì85) and the London Hospital in Whitechapel (1885‚Äì88). He became a house surgeon at the London Hospital in 1886, under Sir Frederick Treves. He was elected as a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1888 and moved to the Royal Free Hospital in London. He taught anatomy at the London Hospital medical school from 1892. Artist  Henry Tonks, photograph by George Charles Beresford, 1922 From 1888 he studied in the evenings at Westminster School of Art, under Frederick Brown. He exhibited paintings with the New English Art Club from 1891 and became a member of the Club in 1895. Brown became Slade Professor of Fine Art at University College, London in 1892, and Tonks started to teach at the Slade School of Fine Art. Tonks became \\"the most renowned and formidable teacher of his generation\\".\\"Tonks, Henry\\" The Oxford Dictionary of Art. Ed. Ian Chilvers. Oxford University Press, 2004.

With hooded stare and sardonic mouth, he hung in the air above me, like a tall question mark, moreover‚Ä¶ of a derisive, rather than an inquisitive order.

Later life He succeeded Frederick Brown as Slade Professor of Fine Art from 1918 to 1930, although he initially turned down the appointment in favour of Walter Sickert, only taking it up when Sickert declined the position. Further post-war students included Thomas Monnington, William Coldstream, Helen Lessore and Philip Evergood. Lessore, who founded the Beaux Arts Gallery with her husband Frederick Lessore in 1923, described him as \\"a towering, dominating figure, about 6ft. 4in. tall, lean and ascetic looking, with large ears, hooded eyes, a nose dropping vertically from the bridge like an eagle's beak and quivering camel-like mouth\\".Lynda Morris, 'Tonks, Henry (1862‚Äì1937)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 9 April 2013 He retired in 1930, and declined the offer of a knighthood.

Picconia azorica The evergreen shrub or small tree species is present in all the islands of the Azores, except the island of Graciosa, usually in coastal and medium altitude forests between to , although most likely above altitudes. The leaves of the plant are evergreen lanceolate or ovate, opposite leaves with entire margins; it flowers from March to July producing small white flowers in axillary clusters.Martins et al. (2011), p.39 The fleshy fruits are dark blue drupes about long, similar to olive trees (both plants pertain to the Oleaceae species).Azores Flora: Picconia azorica Status The species is very popular in traditional/artesnal carpentry, for furniture construction and religious sanctuary. Since its colonization, the resources of the different islands of the Azores were used to sustain its population. This meant that the forests were also cut-down to support the local economy and day-to-day activities, and other non-endemic species planted to support growing populations, such as the Cryptomeria (Cryptomeria japonica) and the Acacia (Acacia dealbata) (which were quick growing in the habitats of the islands). Overexploitation of the wood led to the species becoming almost extinct in some islands. It has become a priority for re-population and conservation, listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List 2004, and Annex II of the Habitats Directive (Berne Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats), due to habitat degradation, expansion of agricultural land, forestation, competition by invader species and isolation of populations.

The eighth problem of the second book of Diophantus's Arithmetica is to divide a square into a sum of two squares. The solution given by Diophantus Diophantus takes the square to be 16 and solves the problem as follows:Arithmetica, Diophantus. Book II, problem 8. As paraphrased on p. 24, Diophantus and Diophantine Equations, Isabella Grigoryevna Bashmakova, updated by Joseph Silverman, tr. from Russian by Abe Shenitzer and Hardy Grant. Washington, DC: The Mathematical Association of America, 1997. . Orig. pub. Moscow: Nauke, 1972. A typo has been corrected in the quote. > To divide a given square into a sum of two squares. To divide 16 into a sum > of two squares. Let the first summand be x^2, and thus the second 16-x^2. > The latter is to be a square. I form the square of the difference of an > arbitrary multiple of x diminished by the root [of] 16, that is, diminished > by 4. I form, for example, the square of 2x ‚àí 4. It is 4x^2+16-16x. I put > this expression equal to 16-x^2. I add to both sides x^2+16x and subtract > 16. In this way I obtain 5x^2=16x, hence x=16/5. Thus one number is 256/25 > and the other 144/25. The sum of these numbers is 16 and each summand is a > square. Geometrical interpretation Geometrically, we may illustrate this method by drawing the circle x2 + y2 = 42 and the line y = 2x - 4. The pair of squares sought are then x02 and y02, where (x0, y0) is the point not on the y-axis where the line and circle intersect. This is shown in the adjacent diagram. Generalization of Diophantus's solution Diophantus II.VIII: Generalized solution in which the sides of triangle OAB form a rational triple if line CB has a rational gradient t. We may generalize Diophantus's solution to solve the problem for any given square, which we will represent algebraically as a2. Also, since Diophantus refers to an arbitrary multiple of x, we will take the arbitrary multiple to be tx. Then: : begin{align} & (tx-a)^2 = a^2-x^2 Rightarrow  & t^2x^2-2atx+a^2 = a^2-x^2 Rightarrow  & x^2(t^2+1) = 2atx Rightarrow  & x = frac{2at}{t^2+1}text{ or }x=0. end{align} Therefore, we find that one of the summands is x^2=left(tfrac{2at}{t^2+1}right)^2 and the other is (tx-a)^2=left(tfrac{a(t^2-1)}{t^2+1}right)^2. The sum of these numbers is a^2 and each summand is a square. Geometrically, we have intersected the circle x2 + y2 = a2 with the line y = tx - a, as shown in the adjacent diagram.Bashmakova, pp. 24‚Äì25. Writing the lengths, OB, OA, and AB, of the sides of triangle OAB as an ordered tuple, we obtain the triple : left[ a; frac{2at}{t^2+1}; frac{a(t^2-1)}{t^2+1}right]. The specific result obtained by Diophantus may be obtained by taking a = 4 and t = 2: : left[ a; frac{2at}{t^2+1}; frac{a(t^2-1)}{t^2+1}right] =left[ frac{20}{5};frac{16}{5};frac{12}{5} right]=frac{4}{5} left[5;4;3right]. We see that Diophantus' particular solution is in fact a subtly disguised (3, 4, 5) triple. However, as the triple will always be rational as long as a and t are rational, we can obtain an infinity of rational triples by changing the value of t, and hence changing the value of the arbitrary multiple of x. This algebraic solution needs only one additional step to arrive at the Platonic sequence [tfrac{t^2+1}{2};t;tfrac{t^2-1}{2}] and that is to multiply all sides of the above triple by a factor quad tfrac{t^2+1}{2a}. Notice also that if a = 1, the sides [OB, OA, AB] reduce to : left[ 1; frac{2t}{t^2+1}; frac{t^2-1}{t^2+1}right]. In modern notation this is just (1,sintheta,costheta), for Œ∏ shown in the above graph, written in terms of the cotangent t of Œ∏/2. In the particular example given by Diophantus, t has a value of 2, the arbitrary multiplier of x. Upon clearing denominators, this expression will generate Pythagorean triples. Intriguingly, the arbitrary multiplier of x has become the cornerstone of the generator expression(s). Diophantus II.IX reaches the same solution by an even quicker route which is very similar to the 'generalized solution' above. Once again the problem is to divide 16 into two squares.This solution is II.IX in the numbering of Diophantos of Alexandria: A Study in the History of Greek Algebra, Sir Thomas Little Heath, Cambridge: University of Cambridge Press, 1885. In the numbering of Diophanti Alexandrini Opera Omnia cum Graecis Commentariis, ed. and translated by Paul Tannery, Leipzig: B. G. Teubner, 1893, it is part of II.VIII. > Let the first number be N and the second an arbitrary multiple of N > diminished by the root (of) 16. For example 2N ‚àí 4. Then: : begin{align} > & N^2 + (2N - 4)^2 = 16 Rightarrow  & 5N^2+16-16N = 16 Rightarrow >  & 5N^2 = 16N Rightarrow  & N = frac{16}{5} end{align} Historical note: Fermat's famous comment which later became Fermat's Last Theorem appears sandwiched between 'Quaestio VIII' and 'Quaestio IX' on page 61 of a 1670 edition of Arithmetica.

Biography  Garza was born in 1948 in Kingsville, Texas. She is the second of five children. This small community is near the Mexico-United States border. Garza loved watching her mother paint, and felt like what her mother did was magic. Garza had also seen her mother painting picture cards for a game that is similar to Bingo around the time she was 8, which increased her love of art even more. Garza wanted to be an artist from the time she was thirteen, when she started drawing every day.https://clgauthorstudy.weebly.com/biography.html Garza helped her grandmother create embroidery patterns using paper cutouts as a young child. The influence of her mother's and grandmother's art-making was very strong and by age thirteen Garza had decided she would be an artist. Her parents encouraged her to pursue her interests in college. Most of the families living in her community growing up were Mexican-American just like her family. When Garza and her brother started to attend school, speaking Spanish was not tolerated. They were often teased by other children who did not understand their culture. Even when Garza attended high school, speaking Spanish was still not tolerated. She and her friends were hit with a paddle as a punishment if they spoke Spanish. Garza first attended Texas Arts and Industry University (now Texas A&M; University, Kingsville). Her parents had been involved in political organizing through the American GI Forum, and Garza followed in their footsteps by organizing a book store Chicanos on her college campus. In 1972, she received a BS in art education and a Texas Teaching Certificate at Texas Arts and Industry. During her undergraduate studies, she decided that it was important for her to create art that would be understood by people of all ages. Garza learned to be proud of her culture, and wanted to educate others using her art. Later, Garza received a Master of Education in 1973 at Juarez-Lincoln/Antioch Graduate School and a Master of Art in 1981 from San Francisco State University. As of 1976, Garza lives in San Francisco, California.  Art and Children's Books  The initial roots of Garza's artwork lay in her family, to whom she is close, and in the Chicano Movement.Mesa-Bains, Amalia. \\"Chicano Chronicle and Cosmology: The Works of Carmen Lomas Garza.\\" In Lomas Garza, p. 16. Garza later wrote that the Chicano Movement nourished her goal of being an artist and gave her back her voice.Lomas Garza, Carmen. \\"A Piece of My Heart / Pedacito de Mi Corazon.\\" In Lomas Garza, pp. 11‚Äì13. She says that her artistic creations helped her \\"heal the wounds inflicted by discrimination and racism.\\" Garza also feels that by creating positive images of Mexican-American families, her work can help combat racism. Her choice to use personal and family images to combat racism is a departure from more political works by many Chicano artists. The creation of her own narrative, rather than one that is forced on her, however, speaks against racism on its own. Garza incorporates little figures (monitos) in her artwork. The figures and their interactions with the spaces they inhabit show how Chicano/a identities are connected to the places she paints. Her paintings are also idealized and the figures become archetypes. Her flattened figures and sense of space create \\"a sense of immediacy,\\" letting the viewer interact directly with the subject matter. Garza has made Day of the Dead ofrendas, or ritual altars, to honor not just family members, but also people from history. She has made ofrendas for Frida Kahlo, Do√±a Sebastiana and Tenochtitl√°n. The artist has created eight paintings for the San Francisco Water Department and a sculpture at San Francisco International Airport. In Chan Kaajal Park, a park opened in 2017 in San Francisco's Mission District, features renderings of a California condor and a great blue heron by Garza, commissioned by the San Francisco Arts Commission. As an author-illustrator, Garza has authored bilingual children's books that are notable for the bilingual text and vivid illustrations. She draws on Chicano culture, family stories, memories, and her heritage.  Exhibitions  In 2013, Garza's Cama para Suenos (1985) and Loteria-Tabla Llena (1972) were included in the Smithsonian American Art Museum's Our America: The Latino Presence in American Art Garza was also featured in the University of Texas at Austin's 7th Annual ¬°A Viva Voz! where she talked and exhibited over 20 of her works. The exhibit ran from April through August 2009. Carmen Lomas Garza: A Retrospective was Garza's first retrospective and featured work from the mid-1970s to the present. It was organized by the San Jose Museum of Art, where it was on view from January to April 2001; it later traveled to the San Antonio Museum of Art, South Texas Institute for the Arts, Ellen No√´l Art Museum, National Hispanic Cultural Center, and the Polk Museum of Art. = Awards and honors= * Family Pictures/Cuadro de familia: One of the Best Books of the Year, Library of Congress (1990) : 1996 Pura Belpr√© Award honor * Vida Award, Arts Category * Several California Arts Council Artist-in-Residence Grants * National Endowment for the Arts Fellowships for Painting and Printmaking * California Arts Council Fellowship * In My Family/En mi familia 1998 Pura Belpr√© Award honor * Magic Windows 2000 Pura Belpr√© Award medal A primary school in Los Angeles, the Carmen Lomas Garza Primary Center, is named in Garza's honor.

History  The Museum was founded in 1942. Its initial creation was based on collections from several small specialized Russian museums. Today, the museum holds about 210,000 exhibits relating to the history of Russian and world military medicine. The exhibits include rare old books, such as the treatise of Ambroise Par√©, the famous French surgeon of the 16th century, published in Paris in 1607. There are also some documents pertinent to the State of Russia, e.g. The Arrangement of the Military Service in the Russian Army, which dates from 1706 and is the edict of the Russian Emperor Peter I of Russia. Also, of unique interest in the collection are the works of art. Some of the more noteworthy works of art include a sketch by the famous Russian painter Ilya Repin of The arrival of Nikolai Ivanovich Pirogov to Moscow celebrating the 50th anniversary of his scientific activities in 1881. A sketch by the Ilya Efimovich Repin of The arrival of Nikolai Ivanovich Pirogov to Moscow celebrating the 50th anniversary of the scientific activities of the great Russian surgeon in 1881 This is the last portrait made of the outstanding Russian surgeon during his lifetime. There is also displayed a historical collection of surgical instruments which dates back centuries. Another important part of the museum is its archives of military medical documents. These archives hold more than 60 million items. Included are the medical charts of all wounded and ill military servicemen beginning with World War II and continuing through all subsequent wars or local military conflicts. Thanks to the archives, the museum archivists were able to collect data directly from one million original documents to support records in the Commemoration Book, which provides a record of the people of Russia who perished during World War II. In addition, the archives contain about 500,000 medical records of foreign citizens from 45 countries. Responding to inquiries from foreign governments, the museum located the documents of more than 100,000 people who were listed in their respective countries as missing in action. The museum researchers carry out extensive analysis of military medical practices from all wars and other conflicts, both the past to the present, in order to improve the outcomes of medical aid. Although no matter how much improvement is made in medical care, one fact still remains clear: the monster of military destruction always overtakes and surpasses the angel of medicine. Moreover, the history of medicine reveals an even more ominous trend, which is the tendency toward the progressive dehumanization of medicine itself. Two hundred years ago, during the French-Russian wars, military doctors impartially treated both their own soldiers and the soldiers of the enemy. The Russian military doctor, Christophor Oppel, was awarded for his service on the battlefield by both the Emperors Alexander I of Russia and Napoleon I of France at the same time! Now, 200 years later, at the beginning of the 21st century, military doctors participate in interrogation of the enemy with the intention of securing critical information with the aid of medicines. Furthermore, there exist some attempts to scientifically substantiate it, contending that the interests of the nation and government are superior to the interest of an individual (see e.g.Bioethics and Armed Conflict: Moral Dilemmas of Medicine and War the 'Book Review' in The New England Journal of Medicine, 2007, Vol. 356, No 13, March 29, pp. 1386-1387). Hence, the implicit and definite civil super-task of the museum is the appeal to societies and governments to promote the use of medicine strictly for the benefit of humanity and not to create any conditions that might promote harm or conflict.

After a series of unsuccessful attempts to establish himself on the throne of Imereti, Archil retired to Russia where he spearheaded the cultural life of a local Georgian community. He was also a lyric poet.  Political career  Archil was the son of Vakhtang V Shahnawaz of Kartli, who, under the Persian protection, attempted to reunify a fragmented Kingdom of Georgia under his crown. Having brought the neighboring eastern kingdom of Kakheti under his control, Vakhtang marched into western Georgia in 1661, deposed King Bagrat V of Imereti, and crowned his fourteen- year-old son Archil king at Kutaisi, capital of Imereti. The Ottoman government strongly objected to what it considered a Persian-inspired incursion into the Turkish zone of influence. A Turkish ultimatum was soon received in Isfahan, threatening a declaration of war if Shahnavaz maintained his son on the throne of western Georgia. Shahnavaz was forced to recall Archil from Kutaisi in 1663 and to restore the rightful king, Bagrat. Instead, Vakhtang installed Archil as king of Kakheti in 1664. To gain the shah's consent, Archil was prevailed upon, much against his will, to become a nominal convert to Islam, assuming the title of Shah-Nazar-Khan. In 1664, Archil defeated an attempt by the rival Kakhetian prince and his brother-in-law, Erekle, to regain his father's crown, and achieved a degree of stability and prosperity in Kakheti. In 1675, however, due largely to the intrigues by the Persian grand vizier Shaykh' Ali Khan, Archil abandoned Kakheti and, with his brother Luarsab, defected to the Turkish frontier pasha of Akhaltsikhe who promised him the crown of Imereti. He was soon reestablished in Kutaisi with the aid of the pasha of Akhaltiskhe, though without the consent of the Sublime Porte. The Ottoman agents had the pasha executed, and deposed Archil in 1679. He fled to Russia, but was not allowed to Moscow until 1686. Encouraged by his brother, King George XI of Kartli, Archil returned to Georgia in 1690 and succeeded in regaining the Imeretian throne, only to be deposed again by the local nobility in 1691. During the next few years, he made several attempts to seize the crown, waging a guerrilla war against the Turks and the aristocratic opposition led by Prince Abashidze. Eventually Archil gave up hope of reestablishing himself in Imereti and, in 1699, crossed the Caucasus Mountains once more into Russia where he settled in Vsesviatskoye near Moscow.  Life in Russia  An illuminated charter issued in Archil's name He was on friendly terms with Peter I of Russia who gave orders to prepare an expedition to restore Archil to the throne of Imereti. However, the plan was rendered abortive on account of the defeat inflicted by the Swedes on the Russian army at Narva in 1700. This, in addition to frustrating Archil's hopes of regaining his throne, brought tragedy into his family life. Alexander, son of Archil, who commanded Russian artillery at Narva, was taken prisoner by the Swedes, and had to spend ten years in captivity. Archil attempted to achieve the release of his son through the Austrian mediation, and later sent a personal letter to Charles XII of Sweden. It was not until 1710, however, that Alexander was released. Severely ill, he died on his way back to Russia. The death of Alexander was a bitter blow to Archil, who did not long survive his son. He died in 1713 and was buried in the Donskoy Monastery at Moscow. Most of Archil's Russian years were devoted to poetry and cultural activities. He was responsible for setting up the first printing press in the Georgian language in Russia and published The Psalms in 1705. Archil's poetry, remarkable for its diversity, heralded the beginning of the period of Revival in Georgian literature. His chief poems ‚Äì The Dialogue between Teimuraz and Rustveli (·Éí·Éê·Éë·Éê·Éê·É°·Éî·Éë·Éê ·Éó·Éî·Éò·Éõ·É£·É†·Éê·Éñ·Éò·É°·Éê ·Éì·Éê ·É†·É£·É°·Éó·Éï·Éî·Éö·Éò·É°·Éê), The Manners of Georgia (·É°·Éê·É•·Éê·É†·Éó·Éï·Éî·Éö·Éù·É° ·Éñ·Éú·Éî·Éù·Éë·Éê·Éú·Éò), and The Lay of Archil (Archiliani; ·Éê·É†·É©·Éò·Éö·Éò·Éê·Éú·Éò) are dedicated to the 17th-century misfortunes of Georgia. He strongly objected to the contemporary Persian literary influences, and called for the revival of Shota Rustaveli's traditions of Georgian poetry. Thus, Archil's poems were closer to traditional Georgian metre, and his idioms closer to Georgian speech. However, despite his efforts to \\"stem the tide of Persianization\\", Archil's poems included \\"conceits, forms, and themes inspired by Persia\\", and his own version of the Alexander romance was modeled on the versions of Nizami Ganjavi and Jami.  Family  Archil was married twice. His first wife was a daughter of Prince Nodar Tsitsishvili. He married secondly to Ketevan, daughter of Prince David of Kakheti, in 1668. The couple one daughter and three sons: * Princess Darejan, known in Russia as Darya Archilovna (c. 1670 ‚Äì 1740); she died unmarried and was buried at the Donskoy Monastery. * Prince Aleksandre, known in Russia as Aleksandr Archilovich (1674 ‚Äì 20 February 1711), a Russian army artillery commander. He was married, with one daughter. * Prince Mamuka, known in Russia as Matfey Archilovich (1676 ‚Äì 23 March 1693); he died unmarried and was buried at the Donskoy Monastery. * Prince Davit, known in Russia as David Archilovich (2 July 1682 ‚Äì 24 October 1688); he died unmarried, buried at the Novodevichy Convent, and reburied in 1711 at the Donskoy Monastery.

Growing to tall and wide, it is a bulbous perennial with short brown stems surmounted by red flowers, the flowers appearing in spring and summer, before the strap-shaped leaves. The generic name Haemanthus is derived from the Greek words haima for blood and anthos for flower; coccineus is the Latin word for red or scarlet. In the Afrikaans language it is known as bergajuin, bloedblom, and many other vernacular names.PlantZAfrica.com accessed 11.11.2011 Distribution Haemanthus coccineus is widespread throughout the winter rainfall region in Southern Africa - from the southern parts of Namibia, to South Africa in the Cape Peninsula, to the Keiskamma River in the Eastern Cape. It is found in Renosterveld and Fynbos habitats. It is an adaptable species, growing in a wide range of soils derived from sandstones, quartzites, granites, shales and limestones. It will survive annual rainfall ranging from . The plant adapts to a wide range of altitudes, being found from coastal dunes to high mountains. It is hardy down to about but does not survive freezing temperatures for any length of time. It is often found in clumps of hundreds, under the shelter of other shrubs on flat land, or in shady ravines and rock crevices. Flower emerging. Foliage. Description The flowerheads of Haemanthus coccineus emerge between February and April, with scarlet spathe valves on them like bright shaving brushes, make it a striking plant. The flowers are soon followed by translucent, fleshy berries. There are usually two large leaves per bulb, and occasionally three, which appear after flowering. The brilliant flowerheads account for its early appearance in Europe, being described by Carl Linnaeus in 1762. Together with Haemanthus sanguineus (Jacq.), this was the first Haemanthus to be introduced to European horticulture as an ornamental plant. In cultivation in the UK, H. coccineus has gained the Royal Horticultural Society‚Äôs Award of Garden Merit. It can be grown outdoors in a warm, frost-free, sheltered, south-facing location. Despite Linnaeus' description, this same species was described under a host of different names (see gallery captions), which reflects more on taxonomic disorganisation than species variability. The plant figured on the left, was first described as Haemanthus hyalocarpus by Jacquin in 1804, and those in the gallery below, which are all H. coccineus, were first described under the caption names.

Having come through the youth ranks at Hull City, he switched to Grimsby Town in 2001 and went on to play at every level of the Football League. While with The Mariners he spent time on loan with Leigh RMI before joining North Ferriby United. In 2006, he emigrated to Australia, where he has since forged a career as a semi- professional where he has featured for Richmond, Heidelberg United, Green Gully Cavaliers and the Port Melbourne Sharks. Playing career =Grimsby Town= Hockless was brought through the youth ranks at his hometown club of Hull City but despite being a regular in the clubs, youth and reserve teams in 2000, he was allowed to join Grimsby Town on a free transfer along with Chris Bolder. The Mariners at the time, were playing in the First Division three divisions higher than Hull so the youngster had taken a big step up in joining them. In his first season, Graham failed to make a single appearance for the club and spent the season in the reserve side. It wasn't until 18 months after signing for the club that he made his debut against Reading. Grimsby would end up relegated at the end of the 2002‚Äì03 season In the following season manager Paul Groves gave Hockless more of a chance within the first team, and after playing in a handful of games he began to become a regular with his performances making an impact in the team as well. In the second to last game of the season Hockless came to prominence when his curling cross setup Isaiah Rankin to score a last gasp winner against Brentford to take the 2003‚Äì04 relegation battle down to the last day of the season. Grimsby were unable to avoid relegation after suffering a 2‚Äì1 defeat against Tranmere Rovers on the final day of the 2003‚Äì04 season, thus meaning the club and Graham's second successive relegation. Hockless went on to receive the \\"Supporters Young Player Of The Season Award\\" . This was something that would attract other clubs in summer 2004, and rumours circulated in the local media that Sheffield Wednesday and former club Hull City (who were now in a higher league than Grimsby) were to swoop for Graham in the transfer window. Despite the interest, Hockless committed himself to the club and signed a one-year contract extension.. Russell Slade took over as the club's manager for the start of the 2004‚Äì05 season but rarely included Hockless, and despite confusion for his prolonged absence by the club's supporters the player was constantly looked past in favour of players such as Thomas Pinault and Ashley Sestanovich. Hockless was eventually allowed to leave the club on loan and joined Conference National outfit Leigh RMI, but after featuring in only 2 games for Leigh he returned to Grimsby. =North Ferriby United= In June 2005, Hockless left Town and signed for non league side North Ferriby United, which was too come as a shock for many following the players rumoured transfer activity 12 months earlier. Chris Bolder the player who joined Grimsby from Hull with him in 2001 also made the move too North Ferriby following a season with Ossett Town. =Australia= After one full season with United, Hockless emigrated to Australia signing for Richmond SC before moving to Heidelberg United in 2008 where he picked up the gold medal for the best player in the Victorian Premier League. In 2010, he signed for Green Gully Cavaliers and later moved on to the Port Melbourne Sharks in 2013. Coaching career Hockless retired from playing in 2013 and spent the 2014 season as assistant coach of South Melbourne FC.

Tyssedal is located in an environment in a valley between the fjord to the west and the mountains leading up to the Hardangervidda mountain plateau to the east. Tyssedal Church is located in this village. The lake Ringedalsvatnet and the Trolltunga cliff are located just to the east, higher up in the valley. The village has a population (2019) of 601 and a population density of . History Tyssedal kraftverk Tyssedal is a typical monotown, depending upon the energy received from the hydropower station. The ilmenite smelter \\"Tinfos Titan and Iron\\" (TTI) (owned by Tinfos) is located here and is the largest employer in the village. The smelter was converted from making aluminium in the late 1980s. The first hydropower station in Tyssedal, Tysso I is today part of the Norwegian Museum of Hydropower and Industry. Tyssedal grew up around this smelter in the early-twentieth century. Language View of Tyssedal Tyssedal drew migrants from different parts of Norway, all of whom spoke Norwegian with a different dialect. As a result, there developed a new dialect in Tyssedal, a mixture of that spoken in the home regions of the migrants; a phenomenon termed by linguists \\"a Koin√© language\\". Tyssedal and the nearby town of Odda--which arose in the same time and socio-economic circumstances --provided valuable insights to linguists studying this phenomenon. Professor Paul Kerswill conducted an intensive study of the Norwegian spoken in the two communities, relating them to very different geographical origins: The workers in Odda came predominantly (86%) from western Norway. In Tyssedal only about one third came from western Norway; one third came from eastern Norway; and the rest from other parts of the country. The dialects that evolved in these two communities were radically different from each other, though spoken at a short geographical distance from each other.

The etymology of Yout is contested, and scholars have proposed varying theories about its origins, including that it may have originated as spirits associated with death, or as a mixture of concepts. The modern spelling may also be a take on the British back slang yob due to the similar characterizations. The first clear mention of a yout was in the early 17th century when Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden began collecting various folklore from his kingdom. This also included the Swedish speaking parts of Finland. Some have suggested that there is even evidence of youts in the Poetic Edda; however, this claim is largely dismissed by most scholars.

It is situated in the Cwm Ogwr Fach (Small Ogmore Valley) between the Cwm Ogwr Fawr (Large Ogmore Valley) to the west and the Cwm Rhondda (Rhondda Valley) to the east. Etymology The translation of Gilfach Goch into English is easily understood (cil = nook or secluded area, bach = small) but several theories have been put forward as to where the name came from, especially the term coch = red. Writing in 1887, Thomas Morgan, put forward the idea that the name was derived from \\"...a heap of red cinders, which still remains as a memento of the ironworks that stood there in times of yore\\". Owen Morgan, a local historian, theorised that the area was the location of an ancient site of importance to the local druids. During the Roman Conquest of Britain, Roman cavalry attacked the 'defenceless of Dinas', but were routed when thousands heeded the call of the Druids. Morgan concludes that coch refers to the blood shed by the defeated Roman soldiers. These theories have been queried more recently, as it has been shown that the area known as Gilfach Goch and, in particular, the site where the red cinders of the ironworks are found, was not originally named as such. Prior to 1860, Gilfach Goch was an area of mountain land situated in the Ogwr Fach valley in the parish of Ystradyfodwg far north of present-day Gilfach. Ordnance survey maps have shown that the name Gilfach Goch is not only the name of the community that sprang up with the coming of coal, but the hill and a strip of land on the east bank of the Ogwr Fach. This section of the Ogwr Fach valley is very narrow and lends itself to the description cil-fach, but is also home to a tributary of the River Ogwr whose bed contains iron ore. The ore reddens the appearance of the stream, which could be the origin of the name. History Gilfach Goch developed as coal mining village during the industrialisation of the south Wales valleys in the 19th century. Three pits were sunk in the area, the Brittanic, the Dinas Main and the Trane and Llewellyn. Evan Evans, a self-made businessman, acquired the mineral rights to large parts of land of Gilfach Goch in the early 1860s. His first mine, the first in Gilfach Goch, was the Dinas Main Colliery. It reached the Rhondda No.3 seam in 1868 and was known for its high quality coal and coke. The Dinas Main Colliery Company sunk two shafts into the steam coal measure between 1894 and 1896, and this pit became known as the Britannic Merthyr Colliery. In 1907 an explosion occurred at the Dinas Main Colliery. Seven men were killed, while others escaped by escaping through an old horse-way tunnel. The Dinas Main was closed after the accident, the Trane pit closed in 1953 and the Britannic closed in 1960. The scattered development of the village's collieries caused a similar scattered approach to the housing, the logic of their placement now lost that the mines have all since closed. At the south end of the village there are a series of parallel cul-de-sac properties lined with cottage pairs, not terraces which are synonymous to the region. This unusual layout was promoted by the Cardiff-based Welsh Garden Cities Ltd as their first Garden Village and was built between 1910-1914. In the 2001 census, of all rural areas with a population over 1,500, Gilfach Goch had the largest percentage of people in the whole of England and Wales who stated that they had no religion.http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/census-2001-key- statistics/urban-areas-in-england-and-wales/urban-areas-in-england-and-wales- ks07--religion.xls Buildings The oldest building in the village is the Griffin Inn, a public house which is situated in low marshy ground at the end of a country lane. The most notable religious building is the church of St Barnabas which began construction in 1896 and was completed in 1899. A nave with a lower chancel was added in 1933. During the Second World War the church was hit by a Luftwaffe bomb; it was reconstructed in the 1950s. Governance The Gilfach Goch electoral ward is coterminous with the borders of the Gilfach Goch community and elects a county councillor to Rhondda Cynon Taf County Borough Council.

It emerged in the process of a tripartite division of the Kingdom of Georgia in 1465 and existed, with several brief intermissions, until 1762 when Kakheti and the neighboring Georgian kingdom of Kartli were merged through a dynastic succession under the Kakhetian branch of the Bagrationi dynasty. Through most of its turbulent history, Kakheti was tributary to the Persians, whose efforts to keep the reluctant Georgian kingdom within its sphere of influence resulted in a series of military conflicts and deportations.  Early history  A previous Kingdom of Kakheti was created in the 8th century following the successful rebellion of the mountainous tribes of Tzanaria, which freed a large part of Georgia from Arab control. Revival of the Kingdom The reemergence of the Kingdom of Kakheti was the first step towards the partition of Georgia which had been embroiled in fratricidal wars since the mid-15th century. This took place after the king George VIII, himself a usurper to the throne of Georgia, was captured by his defiant vassal Qvarqvare III, Duke of Samtskhe, in 1465, and dethroned in favor of Bagrat VI. He then set himself up as an independent ruler in his former princely appanage of Kakheti, the easternmost province of Georgia centered on the river valleys of Alazani and Iori, where he remained, a sort of anti-king, till his death in 1476. Overwhelmed by these difficulties, Constantine II, king of a reduced Georgia, was obliged to sanction the new order of things. He recognized in 1490 Alexander I, son of George VIII, as King of Kakheti in the east, and in 1491 Alexander II, son of Bagrat VI, as King of Imereti in the west, leaving himself in control of Kartli. In this way the tripartite division of the Kingdom of Georgia was consummated.  Brief annexation by Kartli  Following the death of George II, who had staged numerous incursions into the neighbouring Kingdom of Kartli, Kakheti was left weakened and annexed by Kartli. However his son, Leon of Kakheti, was taken covertly to the Kakhetian mountains at the age of 9 to prevent him from being captured by the Kartlians. Following the invasion of Kartli by Ismail I, Shah of Iran, the nobles who had brought Leon to the mountains saw an opportunity, and declared Leon King of Kakheti. Following a 2-year war, Kartli rescinded control over Kakheti and recognised the nation's independence.  Kakheti in the 16th century  The ruins of a royal castle at Gremi. Unlike other Georgian polities, Kakheti was spared, for the time being, from major foreign incursions and significant internal unrest. Furthermore, it had the advantage over other parts of Georgia of flanking the important Ghilan-Shemakha-Astrakhan ‚Äúsilk route.‚Äù The Kakhetian government sponsored this trade and actively participated in it, closely tying the kingdom to the economic life of eastern Transcaucasia and Iran. The extensively cultivated fertile lands of Kakheti combined with vibrant Jewish, Armenian and Persian colonies in the trading towns of Gremi, Zagemi, Karagaji, and Telavi, resulted in prosperity, not observable in other parts of a fragmentized Georgia. This relative stability for a time strengthened the monarch's power and increased the number of his supporters among the nobility. Threatened by the emerging great empires of the East ‚Äì those of the Ottomans and the Safavids‚Äì the kings of Kakheti persuaded a carefully staged politics of balance, and tried to establish an alliance with the co-religionist rulers of Muscovy against the shamkhals of Tarki in the North Caucasus. An Ottoman-Safavid peace deal at Amasya in 1555 left Kakheti within the sphere of Safavid Iranian influence, but the local rulers still maintained considerable independence and stability by showing willingness to cooperate with their Safavid overlords. Nevertheless, in 1589, Alexander II of Kakheti officially pledged his allegiance to Tsar Feodor I of Russia, but the alliance was never actually implemented in practice. With Alexander's murder in an Iranian-sponsored coup staged by his own son, a Muslim convert Constantine I, in 1605, the fortunes of Kakheti began to reverse. The people of Kakheti refused to accept the patricide and overthrew him, forcing the energetic Safavid shah Abbas I to reluctantly recognize the rebels‚Äô nominee and Constantine's nephew Teimuraz I as a new king in 1605. Thus began Teimuraz's long and difficult reign (1605‚Äì1648) in conflict with the Safavids.  Iranian hegemony  Teimuraz I of Kakheti and his wife Khorashan. A sketch from the album of the contemporaneous Roman Catholic missionary Cristoforo Castelli. In the mid-1610s, Shah Abbas I renewed his effort to bring Georgia more completely into the Safavid empire and subjected Kakheti to repeated invasions in 1614, 1615 and 1616. In a series of Georgian insurrections and Iranian reprisals, sixty to seventy thousand people were killed, and more than one hundred thousand Kakhetian peasants were forcibly deported into Iran. The population of Kakheti dropped by two-thirds; once flourishing towns, like Gremi and Zagemi, shrank to insignificant villages; agriculture declined and commerce came to a standstill. By 1648, the indefatigable Taimuraz had finally been ousted from Kakheti. The Safavid government tightened its control of Kakheti, implemented a policy of replacing the native population with nomadic Turkic tribes. At the same time, the Dagestani mountaineers started to attack and colonize the Kakhetian marchlands. In 1659, Kakhetians staged a general uprising, thwarting Safavid plans to settle tens of thousands of Turkomans in Kakheti. Yet, Kakheti remained under Iran's political control; the three aristocratic leaders of the uprising surrendered and were executed. Some years later, Vakhtang V Shah-Nawaz, a Muslim Georgian king/vali of Kartli, managed to obtain the shah's permission to install his son Archil as king/vali in Kakheti. For a time, the two kingdoms of eastern Georgia were virtually united under Shah-Nawaz and his son, and a period of relative peace ensued. Making the town of Telavi his capital, in place of Gremi which was ruined by the Iranian invasions, Archil set out to implement a program of reconstruction. However, the promising situation was of short duration. Archil's ascension in Kakheti marked the beginning of a rivalry between the two Bagrationi branches ‚Äì the Mukhrani, to which Archil belonged, and the House of Kakheti, dispossessed of the crown in the person of Teimuraz I. This latter house finally succeeded, at the expense of their apostasy to Islam, in reestablishing themselves in 1703, and ruled, henceforth, at the pleasure of their Safavid suzerains. This proved to be of little benefit, however, and the kingdom continued to be plagued by the incessant Dagestani inroads. From 1724 to 1744, Kakheti was subjected to the successive Ottoman and Iranian occupations. However, the service rendered by the Kakhetian prince Teimuraz II to Nader Shah of Iran in the struggle against the Ottomans resulted in an annulment of heavy tribute paid by Kakheti to the Iranian court in 1743. In 1744, as a reward for their loyalty, Nader granted the kingship of Kartli to Teimuraz II and that of Kartli to his son Erekle II. Both monarchs were crowned in accordance to a Christian tradition in 1745. They exploited the turmoil in Iran that followed Nader's assassination in 1747 and established themselves as virtually independent rulers. Their rule helped to stabilize the country; economy began to revive, and the Dagestani attacks were reduced, but not eliminated. When Teimuraz died on January 8, 1762, Erekle succeeded him, thus uniting eastern Georgia as a single state for the first time in nearly three centuries,Keith Hitchins.

Friedman follows the four-source documentary hypothesis model, but differs significantly from Julius Wellhausen's model in several respects. Most notably, Friedman agrees with Wellhausen on the date of the Deuteronomist (the court of Josiah, c. 621 or 622 BC), but places the Priestly source at the court of Hezekiah; his sequence of sources therefore runs Jahwist‚ÄìElohist‚ÄìPriestly‚ÄìDeuteronomist [JEPD] (while Wellhausen order it as Jahwist‚ÄìElohist‚ÄìDeuteronomist‚ÄìPriestly [JEDP] in his Documentary Hypothesis model). Like Wellhausen, he sees a final redaction in the time of Ezra, c. 450 BC.  Summary  The core of the book, taking up almost 300 of its approximately 380 pages in the paperback edition, is Friedman's own translation of the five Pentateuchal books, in which the four sources plus the contributions of the two redactors (of the combined JE source and the later redactor of the final document) are indicated typographically. The remaining sections include a short introduction outlining Friedman's thesis, a \\"Collection of Evidence,\\" and a bibliography. Friedman's version of the documentary hypothesis can be summarised as follows: The first source to be written down was the Jahwist, or J. This occurred in the Kingdom of Judah, the southern of the two Israelite kingdoms, in the period between 922-722 BC. (Friedman's arguments are dealt with below). The Elohist, or E, was composed in roughly the same period, but probably a little later than J, in the northern kingdom of Israel. In 722 BC the Assyrian conquest of Israel brought E to Judah with refugees from the northern kingdom. Shortly after this a redactor combined the two into a standard text, JE, the redactor himself being known as RJE. Then in the reign of Hezekiah, c.715-687 BC, the Jerusalem priesthood produced a text which they saw as a replacement for JE, the theology of which was objectionable to their project of religious reform: this was the Priestly source, or P. Hezekiah's reform program failed, but was revived in the reign of his great-grandson Josiah, c. 640-609 BC, producing the last source, the Deuteronomist, or D. The three sources (JE now counting as a single source) existed independently until the return from the Babylonian exile, when a final redactor, R, combined them. The \\"Collection of Evidence\\" section sets out Friedman's arguments for the documentary hypothesis in general and for his own version of it in particular. He notes seven arguments: * Linguistic: each source (treating JE as a single source) reflects the Hebrew of its period. * Terminology: Certain words and phrases appear disproportionately, or exclusively, in certain sources. * Consistent content: Certain concepts, objects, and practices are specific to certain sources. * Continuity of texts: When separated into sources following linguistic, terminological and contextual clues, each source constitutes a coherent, self- contained narrative. * Connections with other parts of the Bible: Each source has direct, non-indiscriminate affinities with other specific parts of the Bible. * Relationships of sources to each other and to history: The sources each have connections to specific circumstances in the history of Israel/Judah, and to each other.  Comparison with Wellhausen  As Friedman himself says in his Who Wrote the Bible?, when a scholar agrees with the documentary hypothesis, he agrees with Wellhausen; when he wishes to propose a new model of the hypothesis, he compares it with Wellhausen.Paraphrase from Friedman's \\"Who Wrote the Bible?\\", pp. 26-27 of 1997 edition (original edition 1987). Friedman agrees with Wellhausen on the identity of the four sources, and on the identification of certain possible or probable authors: Jeremiah and/or his scribe, Baruch ben Neriah, as the author of D, Ezra as the Redactor. (These identifications in fact were made long before Wellhausen: the identification of the Redactor with Ezra can be traced to Spinoza in the 17th century or even Jerome in the 4th). Where he departs most radically from Wellhausen is in dating P to the time of Hezekiah, almost a century before Josiah and the D source. Wellhausen's placing of P after D, so that the sequence of sources was JEDP, was crucial to the view of the development of Israelite religion from original polytheism to Judaic monotheism; Friedman's reordering of the sources is thus his major challenge to Wellhausen's model, as it undermines Wellhausen's thesis that the Priestly Code represents the final development of a priest-centred religious practice. Friedman's dating of J to the time of the divided kingdom - Wellhausen put it in the 10th century BC rather than the 8th - is also novel, but less so than his ordering of the sources.  Critical assessment  The documentary hypothesis as defined by Wellhausen, having dominated critical thinking on the origin of the Pentateuch, came into increasing question from the late 1960s onwards as alternative models - supplementary and fragmentary rather than the discrete documents of the DH paradigm - were put forward. Friedman's book is thus in one sense an answer to these critics, and perhaps especially to R. N. Whybray, whose 1987 The Making of the Pentateuch had concluded that the tools by which the documentary model distinguished its supposed documents were fundamentally faulty: how could they suppose, he asked, that the authors of each of the four so-called source documents had not tolerated inconsistency, but that the two redactors had had no problems with it? Scholars as eminent as Baruch Halpern and Michael D. Coogan (editor of The New Oxford Annotated Bible) welcomed The Bible with Sources Revealed as an indispensable teaching tool; nevertheless, Friedman's departures from Wellhausen have been criticised by his professional colleagues on several grounds, not least for ignoring all other models and all advances in scholarship outside his preferred documentary model. For example, the review in the Review of Biblical Literature noted: \\"It is basic for the understanding of biblical literary history that the Supplementary Hypothesis is the 'normal hypothesis' (even within the Pentateuch) and that the Documentary Hypothesis (i.e., the fusion of two literary sources) is only a notable exception.\\" Also, some scholars advocated 'the Fragmentary hypothesis' for another major text-critical approach to the Pentateuch's authorship. Moreover, Friedman was criticised for ignoring evidence that P did not precede Deuteronomy, for an arbitrary approach to his assignment of sources, and for failing to note or argue with scholarship that does not support his argument. On the other hand, his close examination of R (and RJE) was welcomed as innovative and useful, as was his schematisation of the arguments in favour of the documentary model.Review by Christof Levin, Review of Biblical Literature, RBL06/2006.

Before his death the following assessment was made of him: \\"He is regarded by many as Africa's greatest living composer, possesses one of the most distinctive compositional voices of our time\\".Review of A composer in Africa Essays on the life and work of Stefans Grov√© Early life In Bethlehem, Orange Free State, where Grov√© was born, his mother worked as a music teacher and his father as a school principal.[South African Music Encyclopedia, edited by Jacques P. Malan. II, 141.] Grov√©'s musical education began at school and his first compositional efforts date from that time. He eventually trained as a pianist and organist, with the guidance from his mother's brother, D.J. Roode. As a student he remained an avid reader of musical scores (often without the assistance of accompanying soundtracks) which not only informed his own development as a composer but may also have developed his talent for sight-reading at the piano. Life and works In 1942 Grov√© moved to Klerksdorp where he worked as a teacher church organist for two years. Thereafter he relocated to study composition at the University of Cape Town first with William Henry Bell and then with Erik Chisholm. Compositions from this time include a ballet suite for orchestra (1944), the String quartet in D major (1945), and a czardas for violin and piano (1946?). As the first South African recipient of a Fulbright Scholarship, Grov√© had the opportunity of going to Harvard University where he completed his master's degree. His teachers there included Thurston Dart and Walter Piston. Works that Grov√© composed under their guidance won him the G. Arthur Knight Prize and the New York Bohemian Prize.[South African Music Encyclopedia, edited by Jacques P. Malan. II, 142.] These were awarded for the Pianoforte trio and the Sonata for pianoforte and cello respectively. Grov√© attended Aaron Copland's composition class at the Tanglewood Summer School and studied the flute at the Longy School of Music.[South African Music Encyclopedia, edited by Jacques P. Malan. II, 142.'] After these studies, beginning in 1956, Grov√© taught at the Bard College for two years, and then at the Peabody Institute in Baltimore for a further eight.[The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, edited by Stanley Sadie. X, 455.] While working at the Bard College, Grov√© also took up a post as choirmaster for the Franklin Street Presbyterian Church, where he pursued an interest in the performance of early music‚Äîmost notably the cantatas of J.S. Bach. A similar venture was undertaken with a group that Grov√© founded in 1962, the Pro Musica Rara. While abroad, Grov√© evidently had a viable platform for the performance of his music. Thus, his Elegy for strings was performed in the Washington Gallery in 1952; the Three inventions for the piano was featured at the Salzburg ISCM Festival of 1953; the Sonata for flute and piano was played at Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1954; the Harp quintet at Guildhall, London, in 1954; the Partita for orchestra in Brussels, in 1964; the First Symphony was led by Max Rudolph with the Cincinnati Orchestra in 1966; the Violin Concerto was performed that same year in Baltimore, Gabriel Banat being the soloist; and the Sinfonia concertante was recorded in 1973 by the Radio Orchestra of South-West Australia. Afrocentrism Grov√© returned to South Africa for a sabbatical in 1960 when he lectured at both the Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education as well as the South African College of Music. He returned to South Africa permanently in 1972 and, the following year, was appointed as a lecturer at the University of Pretoria. Grov√© was one of the first white South African composers to incorporate elements of black African music into his own style, \\"venturing far beyond mere couleur locale to forge a unique creative synthesis of the indigenous and the \\"Western\\".\\" Grov√©'s 'African' stylistic phase was result of a Damascus moment when he overheard a song sung by an African streetworker. The melody haunted him and inspired the Sonata on African Motives for violin and pianoforte (1984). Some other works composed in Grov√©'s afrocentirc style are, the Dance Rhapsody (1986), Liedere en danse van Afrika (1990), 7 Boesman-liedere for soprano and string quartet (1990), Gesang van die Afrika-geeste (1993), Nonyana, the Ceremonial Dancer for piano (1994), Afrika Hymnus I for organ (1995), and Afrika Hymnus II for organ (1996). Remembering the African element in Grov√©'s mature style, one can trace his development \\"from Debussy and Ravel through to Bartok and the neo-classicism of Hindemith, with passing passions for Messiaen and a more lasting fascination for Bach and early counterpoint\\".[Stefanus Muller and Chris Walton, 2006, p. 3. A Composer in Africa: Essays on the life and work of Stefans Grov√©] He undoubtedly had a better exposure to European and American avant-garde than his contemporaries and that difference can be noticed in the quality of his music. His work, Glimpses. Five Miniatures for Piano (2004) was performed at the ISCM World Music Days in Hong Kong in November 2007.STEFANS GROV√â'S GLIMPSES TO BE PERFORMED He died in Pretoria, aged 91. Writing Apart from his work as a composer, Grov√© was also a fine writer whose essays and short fiction has received praise from no less a figure than Andr√© P. Brink. He was also active as a music critic, most notably for the newspapers Rapport and Beeld. Legacy He forms part of a triumvirate of white Afrikaans composers who are considered as \\"founding fathers of South African art music\\". The other two composers in this category are Arnold van Wyk and Hubert du Plessis. Beyond that, and arguably more significantly, Grov√© has managed to shape a \\"hybrid style\\"[Stefanus Muller and Chris Walton, 2006, p. 2. A Composer in Africa: Essays on the life and work of Stefans Grov√©] for himself, beginning a new creative phase in a time when it must have amounted to a radical move on his part: he was a white composer‚Äîworking in a country that was still functioning at the height of P.W. Botha's apartheid administration‚Äîwhose new style was rejecting any notions of apartheid (separateness) by fusing white South African (Western) and black South African (African) musical languages. Unlike van Wyk and du Plessis, he was \\"prepared to consider and eventually to develop consistently a rapprochement between his Western art and his physical, African space\\".

It is one of St. Cloud's two major public high schools, the other being Apollo. The school's first building was built in 1917, with another building added in the 1970s to accommodate the student population. A brand new facility was completed in 2019. Former St. Cloud Tech High School  Academics  St. Cloud Tech offers Advanced Placement courses. Students have a wide variety of choices for Advanced Placement, including math, science, language, and social sciences, with a total of 19 AP courses. Students at both Apollo and Technical High Schools have performed very well on AP Exams, with approximately 70% of students receiving college credit for their scores. Other options for additional rigor are available as well, including Senior to Sophomore, the state's Post Secondary Enrollment Options (PSEO), articulated college credit, Discovery Academy, SciGals, and Upward Bound. In the 1980s and 1990s, Tech served as both a senior and junior high school, with grades 7‚Äì12 in attendance. The class of 1994 was the last to attend Tech from grade 7 through grade 12.  Sports  St. Cloud Tech has a number of boys' and girls' sports programs, including football, baseball, basketball, volleyball, gymnastics, golf, softball, hockey, alpine skiing, lacrosse, Nordic skiing, wrestling, soccer, tennis, swimming, cross-country running, track and field and adaptive sports. Tech is in the Central Lakes Conference, competing against other high schools in and around central Minnesota, including its crosstown rival Apollo. Tech's mascot is the Tiger, with its athletic teams sporting the tiger's colors of black and orange. Tech's football team formerly played across the street from the school at Clark Field, which was affectionately nicknamed \\"The Pit\\" or \\"The Hole\\" by opposing school's players. In September 2012, it was announced that Clark Field would be temporarily but indefinitely closed because of poor conditions, including mold and lead. Varsity events that would have been held there are held at Saint Cloud State University. The field is still used for smaller events. Tech's new sports complex is located on the same grounds as the new high school. As a result, athletic activities occur on site on the new complex of fields for baseball, football, soccer, and tennis. Music Tech High School has a music program, with orchestra, band, and choir as the three major components. The orchestra, led since 2009 by Kara Mather, is broken into three groups, according to ability: Concert Orchestra, Symphony Orchestra, and Chamber Orchestra. The Chamber Orchestra is a smaller elite team of musicians who have volunteered to practice before school one day a week. It performs at special events in the community, as well as at Tech. Symphony Orchestra is the primary orchestral group at Tech, and the Concert group comprises mostly freshman and sophomore students. A notable previous director of the orchestra program is Steven Eckblad, now retired, who is still a prominent musician in the St. Cloud area, teaching cello and bass while playing bass in the St. Cloud Symphony Orchestra. Some Tech students also participate in the St. Cloud Symphony. The band is conducted by Gary Zwack, and the choir by Kevin Kiffmeyer. Starting in the 2012‚Äì13 school year, an AP music theory course will be offered, taught by Zwack. The Tech Band and Orchestra have a tradition of going on tour every two years to a major city in the United States. Some recent destinations have been Orlando in 2014, New Orleans in 2012, and New York City in 2010. Activities A variety of extracurricular activities are offered at St. Cloud Tech, including Speech, TARGET, Math Team, Students Against Destructive Decisions (SADD), Knowledge Bowl, Music Listening Contest, the Economics Challenge, and National Honor Society. These programs have helped students develop leadership skills. At the 2013 Econ Challenge, Tech senior Tyler Benning was named the #1 Econ student in the state. Led by head coach Karmin Schraw, the speech team placed 8th at the 2013 National Forensics League national tournament in Alabama. Phillip Hoelscher, a 2013 graduate, placed 8th in the Drama category, beating out hundreds of kids from around the nation. The previous year he placed 2nd in Drama at the Harvard Invitational while his teammate, Maria Null, took 5th place in Drama that same year. The speech team has also won the Central Lakes Conference title 21 years in a row.  New building  After a referendum on November 8, 2016, it was announced that the school would be moved to a new building and renamed Tech High School. The 100-year-old school building celebrated its last school year in June of 2019. Athletic facilities at the new school include a pool, three court main gym and one court auxiliary gym, multipurpose activities room, fitness room, multipurpose outdoor stadium, four multipurpose grass fields, three softball fields, two baseball fields, and eight-court outdoor tennis facility. New Tech features an 800 seat auditorium; choir, orchestra, and band ensemble rooms, and small group practice rooms; 2D and 3D art studios.

It is found in Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, Tanzania, Uganda, and Yemen.World Conservation Monitoring Centre 1998. Pistacia aethiopica. 2006 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Downloaded on 23 August 2007. Description It is an evergreen slow-growing tree that emits a very intense smell: bitter, resinous or similar to medication. The tree reaches 5‚Äì15 m tall, and rarely is a shrub, often with multiple stems, the trunk of 0.6 m in diameter, and its bark color is brown-black and fissured. It has glabrous leathery leaves, with a thick cuticle. The leaves are aromatic, 4-16-18 foliolate, and glossy bright green. The leaves have rachis 10 cm long. The tree is dioecious, with male and female trees producing different sex flowers. Both types of flowers are small and greenish. It grows slowly, becoming 1000 years old. Ecology It is found in dry evergreen forest (often with Juniperus and Olea - Euclea) and associated shrubs or wooded grassland, thickets of Buxus, deciduous with Combretum, Acacia and Barkey in soils of limestone, sandstone, or basalt, to an altitude of 900‚Äì2550 m. P. aethiopica have many adaptations to aridity, such as an advanced development of palisade tissue and extensive root growth. These adaptive traits allow species to grow in very harsh and dry areas with low rainfall. In the main part of its range in North and East Africa, the species is fairly common because is used for a variety of purposes, including timber, dye, fodder, agriculture and livestock food. An outlying subpopulation in Arabia is restricted to Jebel Iraf on the old North Yemen-South Yemen border. The species is thought to be extinct in Eritrea.

One of its main uses was to transport prisoners as forced labour in the Kolyma camps system.  Prior to Soviet ownership  The ship was originally christened Childar when launched on 25 November 1925. It was operated as a merchant vessel for several years by the Norwegian line Wiel & Amundsen Rederi A/S, based in Halden. Childar ran aground on 4 May 1934 at the entrance to the Columbia River in the United States while en route to Cape Town, South Africa. Four seamen were killed in this incident. The ship was eventually was repaired at Porsgrunn and re- launched in May 1935 as MS Aakre by another Norwegian line, Rederi A/S Henneseid (Thoralf Holta). In 1939, it was purchased by the Latvian United Shipping Company (ApvienotƒÅ Kuƒ£niecƒ´bas Akciju Sabiedrƒ´ba), in Riga, Latvia, and renamed Hercogs Jƒìkabs, in honour of Duke Jacob of Courland. It was planned that she would maintain a monthly cargo service between Riga and New York City. At that time it was one of the biggest and most modern ships in Latvia as it was only second ship with diesel engine in Latvian merchant fleet. Ship was involved in trans Atlantic voyages from Europe to North and South America.  In Soviet service  When Latvia was occupied by the Soviet Union in 1940, all merchant vessels were nationalised by the Soviet state, including Hercogs Jƒìkabs. Some of the ships were within the immediate control of Soviet authorities and were thereby impressed into the service of the Soviet-controlled Latvian State Sea Shipping Company. However, many Latvian- registered ships outside Soviet-controlled waters defected and turned themselves over to the control of other nations. The exception to the last rule was Hercogs Jƒìkabs, which even though outside the reach of Communist authorities along the coast of Chile, nonetheless attempted to sail to the USSR, despite differing opinions among the crew. A dispute about ownership and control was resolved in the favor of the USSR despite the attempts of Latvian diplomats in the West and in time the ship voyaged for Vladivostok. The ship was renamed Sovetskaya Latviya in 1942, around which time it entered service for the NKVD and Dalstroy. It was struck from the Soviet register in 1967.

He was born in Dehylov, Silesia on October 25, 1911. His father also was a violin-maker, and Alois started to learn the art of violin-making in 1919. In 1929, as a high school student, he finished this education by presenting a sample work (a violin and some work on the violin scroll) to his teacher. Upon the teacher‚Äôs evaluation, he received a diploma certifying him as a professional violinmaker. It was delivered to him by his father in the day of his 18th birthday, on October 25, 1929. After finishing high school, Dr. Honek moved to Prague and started studying medicine at the Charles University, despite his father's wishes for him to become a professional violin-maker. A couple years later he became a doctor. Though the profession of a surgeon is very demanding, he devoted all of his free time until the very end of his live to violin-making and research. He died unfortunately due to an injury at the age of almost 91 on June 30, 2002. A. V. Honek started to study the famous secrets of the Cremona violin-makers as a fifteen years old high school student. He was asked for a translation of an old Latin text concerning violins and he was allowed to make a copy. Initially, the document didn't make any sense to him, but after some time he found a way of giving these letters and numbers a sense. Based on this document and decades spent studying the art of violin- making, he made his model based on the knowledge of the masters of Cremona. He also spent many years working on a method that would be useful in assessing objectively the tone quality of violins. His results in this area were published in several magazines. During his life he has made a large number of instruments (violins, violas, cellos and also double basses) according to his model. Almost 100 of them are being played by orchestra members and soloists not only in the Czech Republic, but also in Germany, Switzerland, United States, Japan, Austria, and other countries. He was a member of Kruh umelcu houslaru, which is an organization unifying the best Czech violinmakers. He was also very close to the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra and he accompanied them for many years around the world as their doctor. He was also a remarkable surgeon with many extraordinary achievements in this field. He was an intellectual with many interests such as mathematics and history. For his political ideas he was imprisoned by the communist government in one of the political trials in the 1950s. He himself said that one of his biggest achievements was that he introduced his younger son and his two only grandsons to all his violin-making knowledge and skills.

The site was a project of the National Centennial Commission (NCC) and the Philippine Centennial Exposition Corporation. Description It has a 35,000-seat amphitheater. In addition, the site is also the new home for the Nayong Pilipino complex, an open-air museum featuring miniature attractions of the Philippines and its culture.PGMA inaugurates Nayong Pilipino Complex at Clark Expo, Philippine Information Agency In early 2010, the site was relaunched as Clark Education City by the Australian International Training and Management group (AITMG). Initial construction of the campus cost AU$6-million, with a capacity of 15,000 students. The institution delivers a range of vocational courses accredited by the Australian Government, English language teaching, and customised training for mining, oil and gas, and affiliated industries. The facility now operates as Site Skills Training RTO 32531 - , which is one of the business units of Site Group International Limited (Site) in the Philippines.

Pittosporum obcordatum was discovered by √âtienne Raoul in 1840 in Akaroa, but could then not be found again on Banks Peninsula for 170 years. It was rediscovered by Melissa Hutchison in 2012 in Okains Bay, and confirmed by local botanist Hugh Wilson. Etymology \\"Pittosporum\\" means \\"pitch seed\\", \\"obcordatum\\" means \\"reversed heart shape\\". Description Pittosporum obcordatum is a dicotyledonous columnar single- trunked shrub or mostly <10 m tall small tree, with slender and interlacing branches, divaricating to many grey or reddish-brown, hairy or glabrous branchlets that bearing small woody capsules and scattered leaves. =Leaves= Pittosporum obcordatum have numerous, tomentulose or glabrous, margins entire or crenate, flat or revolute leaves, they have various shapes, usually 5‚Äì10 mm wide, mostly as long as wide. In different stage, leave are slight different, from size,shape, color to position on branchlets. seedling lamina: 5.0~10.0 ?2.5~8.0 mm; oblong, narrowly oblong, oblanceolate to elliptic, linear or spathulate; sometimes entire dark, brown-green, dark green, or mottled yellow-green; alternate on young branchlets; usually with apices deeply lobed; subadult lamina: 3.5~6.0 ?4.0~6.0 mm; oblong, obcordate- trilobate, narrowly oblong to elliptic, dark green to yellow-green, sometimes mottled; alternate on young branchlets or confined to the tips of brachyblasts;coriaceous or submembranous; adult lamina: 2.8~4.0 ?3.0~4.0 mm; orbicular, obovate, apex obcordate or obtuse; confined to the tips of brachyblasts; coriaceous. =Flowers= The colors of flowers are pink maroon or pale yellow, often with red-tinged margins, or striped red, 5~8 mm long, 1~5 flowered assemble to an umbellate; pedicels sparsely ciliolate, pubescent bracts. Sepals 1.5~3.0 ?0.5~1.0 mm, lanceolate-subulate,acute, ciliate, ovate- subulate; petals 4.0~6.5 ?0.7~1.5 mm, linear-oblong,obtuse to subacute lanceolate; night-fragrant, gynodioecious. The male flowers and females flowers are different: Male flowers: stamens 4, filaments 2.5~4.5 mm long, pink or yellow, anthers 0.5~1.0 mm long, yellow or pinkish yellow; gynoecium rudimentary or functional. Female flowers: stamens 4 rudimentary; ovary 1.5~3.3 ?0.5~1.5 mm, finely pubescent to hairy; style 1.0~1.2 mm long; stigma capitate, obscurely 2-lobed or truncate. Capsules 2-valved, 6.5~10.0 ?5.0~7.0 mm, ovoid, subovoid to ellipsoid, apiculate, green to black, coriaceous, weakly rugose, sparsely hairy, glabrate; mucilage yellow. Seeds 2‚Äì6, irregular, globose, lustrous dark black. =Fruits= Fruits is splitting into two, 6.5‚Äì10 mm long. =Similar taxa= Although Pittosporum obcordatum is easy recognize due to its special features, but it easy been confused with other small-leaved divaricating shrubs, such as Myrsine divaricata A.Cunn. However Myrsine divaricata have purple, fleshy fruits containing a single seed, and have a dark black blotch at the leaf base petiole junction. Distribution Natural global range : New Zealand indigenous (endemic) species New Zealand range : In about 1841, it was first discovered by E.Raoul near Akaroa. After that, the number of Pittosporum obcordatum reduce rapidly. In 1980, only three very small colonies in eastern North Island know this plant, the places are Wairoa, Tukituki River near Hastings, and Tauwhero River near Masterton. And in 1981, there were estimated to be fewer than 50 individuals in total in the 1981 Red Data Book of New Zealand. In 1994, the plant scattered along the length of New Zealand include 12 locations in 4 regions. And the total number of individuals in wild is about 2500, South Island took up about 60%, and two North Island localities (Mangarouhi, Waipukurau and Wairua, Whangarei) have more than 300 individuals. Pittosporum obcordatum also been found in Paengaroa Mainland Island. Habitat Pittosporum obcordatum prefer lowland kahikatea/matai forest, terrestrial, or eastern lowland alluvial forest. According to Clarkson & Clarkson (1994) ecological investigations in North Island's six locations, Pittosporum obcordatum prefers habitat is river flats, usually \\"near backswamps and margins of oxbow lakes and cut-off meanders\\", with <200 meters altitude, 9~15 degree Celsius mean annual temperatures, 1000 mm~1500 mm mean annual rainfall and frequent raining in winter and drought summer. Pittosporum obcordatum also found in primary and secondary forest, treeland, and scrub which usually dominated by Dacrycarpus dacrydioides and/or Prumnopitys taxifolia with abundance and diversity of divaricating shrubs or trees. So it can be seen as a health-indicator species of divaricate-rich vegetation. Life cycle/phenology Pittosporum obcordatum grows very slow as a lowland small trees and shrubs and be estimated has a maximum lifespan of 120 years (Clarkson & Clarkson,1994). According to Clarkson & Clarkson's (1994) ecological investigations in North Island's six locations, new season's vegetative growth begins at epigeal germination from the last week of August to October; after germination, the new plants reveal 3~4 cotyledonary leaves, followed by juvenile leaves. According to the seedling emerged time, first juvenile leaves appear in different time, if seedlings that emerged in mid summer, first juvenile leaves appeared after 5‚Äì7 days. However, for some seedlings that emerged in late autumn remained, there may be no juvenile leaves or an arrested juvenile leaf until the following spring. Pittosporum obcordatum(2n=24) is dioecious, which means male plants contribute genes to next generation by pollen only, female plants pass on genes only via ovules. However, some males or females plants (6.6%) occasionally produce few seed capsules and become inconstant males or inconstant females. And about late September to early December the plant flowering and lasting about 3 weeks, but population in different altitude and latitude have slight different flowing time, for example, higher altitude and more inland plants flowering slightly later. December to May fruiting and the fruits and persist for a long time. Predators and threats Pittosporum obcordatum has a low genetic diversity due to a bottleneck effect. Flooding in pre-European times may have contributed to new establishments of P. obcordatum. Deforestation and predation have also caused numbers to drop. Pittosporum obcordatum is currently a threatened plant. This is largely due to deforestation, browsing mammals, and invasive weeds that take over its habitat. Weeds such Carex divulsa as suffocate P. obcordatum, making it difficult for the plant to regenerate. Conservation As well as 54 indigenous species, P.obcordatum is currently defined as ‚Äúnationally endangered There are some recommendations to ensuring that P. obcordatum does not go extinct. As previously mentioned the removal of invasive species such as Carex divulsa would allow P. obcordatum to regenerate. Fencing areas where P. obcordatum grows would also help to preserve plants. Cultural uses Pittosporum obcordatum has been documented to have medicinal uses. It has been used as a salve to soothe eczema of the scalp and has also been recorded to have been used for scabies. Certain parts of P. obcordatum would be dried in the sun and then pounded, producing a powder. The powder would be mixed with hinu-k≈çhia oil to form a salve.

The group was unofficially dissolved in 2001 when Fischer invited Erol Unala to contribute to the reformation of Celtic Frost. Their name is taken from the Celtic Frost demo \\"Under Apollyon's Sun\\". History The band were first discovered in 1997 by London-based Sanctuary Music Management, on the strength of their Industry Demonstration EP. Subsequently managed by Rod Smallwood and Merck Mercuriadis, Apollyon Sun released a five-track debut mini-album - God Leaves (And Dies) on London's Mayan Records in summer of 1998 and then contributed \\"God Leaves\\" and \\"Relinquished Body\\" for the soundtrack of top-rated BBC TV show City Central. Work on a full album, Sub, began at London's Trident Studios that same year, with producer Roli Mosimann (Bj√∂rk, Marilyn Manson, Faith No More). Further recording and mixing sessions took place at Manhattan's EastSide Sound, London's Nomis Studios, and at various studio locations in Switzerland. Sub features prominent final mixes by Mosimann, John Fryer (HIM, Nine Inch Nails), and Apollyon Sun themselves. Sub was released globally through Mayan Records in late summer 2000, after two years of studio work. Fall 2000 saw the band's first international concerts, among them a very radical and uncompromising show attached to the UK's \\"Kerrang! Awards\\", in London. In 2001 and 2002, Apollyon Sun made further soundtrack contributions for the BBC, among them music for the high profile TV production Red Cap with Tamzin Outwaithe. Unala and Fischer also participated in former Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl's (Foo Fighters) Probot album project. Co-written by Grohl, Fischer and Unala, the resulting song \\"Big Sky\\" features Fischer on vocals and Unala on guitars. Work on Apollyon Sun's third album, tentatively titled Flesh, began as early as 2000, this time at the band's own newly expanded studio facilities in Switzerland as well as at Unala's and Fischer's home recording studios. The resurgence of Celtic Frost and the songwriting and recording work for Celtic Frost's first album in 13 years served to temporarily put Apollyon Sun on hiatus and interrupt work on Flesh - Celtic Frost had not only required Fischer's services again but also asked Unala to join the re-formed project as the band's guitarist and programmer. Apollyon Sun's activities has remained on hold since Fischer and Unala departed for Celtic Frost. Guitarist Unala has not continued any Apollyon Sun activities since leaving Celtic Frost in 2006. Fischer has since stated he has no intention of contributing to Apollyon Sun again.

The publishing house, originally named Soci√©t√© Les Belles Lettres pour le d√©veloppement de la culture classique, was founded by the Association Guillaume Bud√©, with the initial goal of publishing Greek and Latin classics.  History  = Foundation = According to the usual story, the history of Belles Lettres began in World War I when the linguist Joseph Vendryes wanted a critical edition of Homer to include in his field pack, but could find only German editions. At the end of the war, the Association Guillaume Bud√© was created, named for the 16th- century French humanist. The association began with the mission of increasing the availability of the great classics of Greek and Latin culture and decided to publish \\"a comprehensive collection of Greek and Latin authors, [both] texts and translations\\". However, the association did not have the necessary funds. The soci√©t√© Les Belles Lettres pour le d√©veloppement de la culture classique was therefore founded as its publishing company; this has since become the soci√©t√© d‚Äô√©dition Les Belles Lettres. Capital was raised from \\"French industrialist friends of the Classics\\", with a total of 300 shareholders. The first president was the Hellenist Paul Mazon, a translator of Homer. The company had its offices at 157 Boulevard Saint-Germain in Paris. After Jean Malye became president of the Belles Lettres, he moved its headquarters to 95 Boulevard Raspail, where they remain. The company currently publishes approximately 100 titles annually. = Distribution company = In 2004, Les Belles Lettres founded a SAS called Belles Lettres Diffusion Distribution (BLDD), through which it distributes books by other publishers. = Fire = On 29 May 2002, a fire destroyed the Belles Lettres warehouse in Gasny (Eure). More than three million books were burnt. A reprinting programme was immediately launched, which has enabled corrections and bibliographic additions.  Collections  = Collection des universit√©s de France = The two first volumes of the Collection des universit√©s de France, bilingual editions of Greek and Latin classics commonly known simply as Bud√© after the association, were published in 1920: in the Greek series, the Hippias Minor of Plato, translated by Maurice Croiset, with a yellow cover and the logo of an aryballos in the form of an owl, representing Athena's owl, and shortly afterwards in the Latin series, the De rerum natura of Lucretius, translated by Alfred Ernout, with a red cover and the logo of the Capitoline Wolf. The one hundredth book was published in 1931. Fulfilling Vendryes' original wish, the Collection des universit√©s de France publishes scholarly editions in a pocket-sized format. The original (with critical apparatus) and the French (with footnotes) are on facing pages, right and left respectively. There is a substantial introduction. The text is intended to be based on the oldest version that can be reconstructed from the surviving manuscripts, for which microfilms are used, and the translation \\"above all to reproduce the movement, color, the tone of the text\\". Editing and translation are assigned to one or more scholars who are specialists in the author concerned and are subject to careful verification by a third expert. A statement of responsibility appears on the reverse of the title page: \\"In accordance with the statutes of the Association Guillaume Bud√©, this volume has been submitted for approval by the technical commission, which has instructed [name] to revise it and oversee its correction in collaboration with [name].\\" The volumes are paperbacks, still in the original size, printed on cream wove manufactured especially for the publisher.C.U.F. Collection Bud√©, Les Belles Lettres Charles Dantzig, \\"Le Secret professionnel de la collection Bud√© - Les √©crivains grecs\\", Radio France, broadcast of 25 November 2012 They were originally sewn but since 1976 have been bound and cropped. , the two series include more than 800 volumes (a few more Greek than Latin). The current goal of the collection is \\"to publish everything written in Greek and Latin before the reign of the Emperor Justinian (in the 6th century)\\". However, Christian writers, although originally fully within the intended range of publications, editorial beginning, are largely left to the Sources chr√©tiennes collection of √âditions du Cerf. Only the literary writings of the church fathers, such as the Confessions of Saint Augustine, have been or will be published in the Collection des universit√©s de France. Since 2006, some of the Latin and Greek works have been reprinted without the critical apparatus in the series Classiques en poche (pocket classics) headed by H√©l√®ne Monsacr√©, with updated translations and where applicable revised texts, for example Oliver Sers' translation of Petronius' Satyricon.P√©trone (Petronius), Satiricon, ed. and tr. Olivier Sers, Classiques de poche 44, Paris: Les Belles Lettres, 2001, . = Les Belles Lettres English (Classical Wisdom Weekly)= In 2012, Les Belles Lettres English was established in order to create an English newsletter and website called Classical Wisdom Weekly. The website launched on 6 November 2012 and is dedicated to promoting and teaching Ancient Greek and Latin literature. The tagline for Classical Wisdom Weekly is \\"Ancient Wisdom for Modern Minds\\". = Other collections = There are also bilingual collections on the history of France, classic medieval texts and classics of English literature (including a bilingual edition of the complete works of Shakespeare). In addition, the company publishes older French authors such as Fran√ßois de Malherbe. * Confluents psychanalytiques, launched in 1976. * Realia, headed by Jean-No√´l Robert and launched in 1983, includes his Les Plaisirs √† Rome. * Histoire features works by French historians such as Pierre Vidal-Naquet and numerous translations of foreign works. * Science et Humanisme includes editions and translations of scientific texts of the Renaissance and the Age of Reason, by authors including Galileo, Johannes Kepler, Campanella and Sir Isaac Newton. * La Roue √† livres consists of translations of works by ancient and Renaissance authors, but without the original text. * L‚Äô√¢ne d‚Äôor features works from the history of ideas, in particular Immanuel Kant, Giordano Bruno, astronomy, and the history of medicine. * Classiques du Nord, headed by R√©gis Boyer, publishes translations of Danish, Swedish, Norwegian and Icelandic literature. * Guides Belles Lettres des civilisations covers periods and places including pre-Columbian America, Viking Iceland, and Brahmin India. * Laissez faire, headed by Fran√ßois Guillaumat, and Biblioth√®que classique de la libert√©, headed by Alain Laurent, publish liberal authors such as Frederic Bastiat, Yves Guyot and Benjamin Constant. Les Belles Lettres has also published outside its collections bilingual critical editions of the complete works of Giordano Bruno and of Petrarch, and less known writers including Jean-Edern Hallier, Philippe Leotard and Francis Lalanne.

History ATA was formally established in 1970 as a direct outcome of the Asia-South Pacific Congress of Evangelism held in Singapore in 1968. It grew out of a concern that \\"evangelicals had neglected theological scholarship in the past and that the Asian church leadership was increasingly being influenced by Western liberal theology.\\" Its primary goal was to develop \\"evangelical scholars, thinkers and teachers\\" for the leadership of the Asian church. Accreditation services were rendered to institutions in 1978. ATA Accreditation Manual Since then, it has developed in serving its member theological institutions in teaching evangelical biblical theology and in the training of Christian pastors and church workers. Its operating principles include strengthening partnership, enhancing scholarship, furthering academic excellence, fostering spiritual and ministerial formation, and mobilising resources to fulfil global Christian mission within diverse Asian cultures. The main reason for the establishment of ATA was to be an aid to theological institutions in contextualising theology in the Asian context. Through this Christian pastors and Christian churches can be aided to be more effective in supporting Christian ministry more effectively with other Asians in their own context. Today the majority of Evangelical Bible colleges in Asia are members of ATA.

The books narrate the experiences that she and her sister Nadia (born 1966) went through after they were sold into marriage by their father, Muthanna Muhsen, a Yemeni √©migr√©. Overview In the books and in interviews, Muhsen states that she and her sister had been sent to Yemen under the assumption that they were going on holiday to meet the paternal side of their family. Muhsen asserts that neither she nor her sister were aware of their father's plans, although her sister Nadia says that her father showed her a photograph of her future husband, Mohammed, in the UK, and that she knew she was going to be married. On their arrival in Maqbanah, Zana, 15 and Nadia, 13 learned from Abdul Khada that she was the spouse of a teenage son of the father's friend. Zana lived in a town called Hockail and Nadia lived in Ashube. Their mother, Miriam Ali, an English woman, appealed unsuccessfully to the Foreign Office for assistance, but was told that the Yemeni government had stated that as they were now married to Yemeni men, they could only leave the country with their husbands' permission. In 1987, an Observer journalist, Eileen McDonald, visited the girls and wrote a series of articles portraying the Muhsens as cruelly-treated slaves. The girls begged McDonald, and her male photographer, to help them leave the country, and the media coverage provoked an outcry in the UK. This led to the Yemeni government giving the Muhsens permission to leave the country in 1988, but forbade them from taking their children (Zana had one child, Marcus,and Nadia three, Hassan and Tina are two of them). Zana Muhsen remained in England and in 1992, wrote Sold: Story of Modern-day Slavery with the ghostwriter Andrew Crofts, describing her experiences. It became an international bestseller and was dramatised by BBC Radio 4. The picture of a veiled woman on the cover of Sold is Nadia Muhsen. In 2001, Zana Muhsen and Crofts wrote a follow-up, A Promise to Nadia - the true story of a British slave. Nadia Muhsen gave an interview to Melanie Finn, a journalist for The Guardian, in 2002 in which she stated that she was happy with her life, saying, \\"It was never in my mind that I wanted to leave. It's just my sister, she wasn't comfortable.\\" According to Zana's Instagram (30 July 2015) Nadia and children (including Marcus) are finally in England. https://www.instagram.com/p/5xT2goDQF8 Bibliography *Sold: Story of Modern-day Slavery (1994) *A Promise to Nadia' (2000) Further reading *de Hart, Betty (2001). \\"Not Without My Daughter: On Parental Abduction, Orientalism and Maternal Melodrama\\".

The shooter's end of the CompM4 with the power control knob The Aimpoint CompM4 is a non-magnified red dot style gun sight adopted by the U.S. Armed Forces. It is produced by the Swedish company Aimpoint AB and is the successor to the earlier Aimpoint CompM2. Overview The Aimpoint CompM4 is a \\"tubed\\" style reflector (reflex) sight that uses a red light-emitting diode (LED) at the focus of a mirror type optical collimator to produce an aligned red aiming spot (what is commonly called a red dot sight). There are a total of 16 brightness settings for the LED, the lower 7 intended for use with night vision devices and the upper 9 for daylight. The CompM4 is powered by a standard AA battery, and the manufacturer claims that the sight will run continuously for 8 years on a single battery, in its 10th brightness setting. Reflector sights have unlimited eye relief, meaning that the user may place his eye at any distance from the sight and the reticle will remain visible. This allows flexibility in mounting and shooting position. The CompM4 uses Aimpoint's \\"parallax-free\\" optical correction system, meaning there is minimal induced optical error that would shift the point of aim relative to the sight's optical axis as the user's eye moves off-center in relation to the sight. The sight itself is parallax-free at around 50 yards, meaning that the red dot will not change position relative to the target based on eye position at that range. As in other reflex sights, the point of aim will change position based on eye position at other ranges with the maximum error being equal to the diameter of the sight's optical window at short range.John Dreyer, Facts and Figures About Dot Sights, Encyclopedia of Bullseye Pistol There are currently two variants available; the standard CompM4 and the CompM4S, the latter being the same in terms of features and functionality, but having the battery compartment & power control knob mounted near the bottom of the sight instead of near the top. =Dimensions= *Length: 120 mm (4.7 in) *Width (sight only): 53 mm (2.1 in) *Height (sight only): 60 mm (2.4 in) *Width (including mount): 72 mm (2.8 in) *Height (including mount): 72 mm (2.8 in) *Mounting ring width: none (does not require mounting ring) *Weight (sight only): 265 g (9.3 oz) *Weight (including mount): 335 g (11.8 oz) Users *: Used by Afghan Commandos on M4 carbine *: Used by Hellenic Army SF. *: Used on M4 carbine by Mumbai Police. *: Used by ISOF. *: Used by Guarda Nacional Republicana. * References External links *Aimpoint AB Firearm sights ","title":"Aimpoint CompM4"},{"id":"12907254","text":"Pleodendron macranthum (chupacallos) is a rare species of tree in the family Canellaceae.

He was born in County Wicklow, Ireland and died at Bardstown, Kentucky. Life One of a large family, Byrne was obliged by the death of his father to become a breadwinner. He had desired to be a priest, but circumstances denied him a more than common elementary education, imparted by an uncle. In his twenty-fifth year he emigrated to the United States, where, shortly after his arrival, he went to Georgetown College and applied for admission into the Society of Jesus.Meehan, Thomas. \\"William Byrne.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 3. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. 2 September 2019 His advanced age and lack of classical education, however, convinced him, after some months' stay there, that he could not reasonably hope to obtain in the Society, for many years at least, his ambition for ordination to the priesthood. He therefore left Georgetown, and by advice of Archbishop Carroll went to Mount St. Mary's College, Emmitsburg. Here the Rev. John Dubois, the president, received him with sympathy, pointed out a course of study, and finding him a good disciplinarian, made him prefect of the institution. He was nearly thirty years of age when he began to study Latin, but his zeal and perseverance brought significant results. In order to advance more rapidly in his studies, he entered St. Mary's Seminary, Baltimore, but the surroundings were not congenial, and he remained there only a short time. He had been ordained a subdeacon, and Bishop Flaget accepted his offer of service for the Diocese of Bardstown, Kentucky. He made further studies at St. Thomas' Seminary there, and was then ordained priest by Bishop David, 18 September 1819, with his friend George Elder, whom he had met at Emmitsburg. They were the first priests ordained at Bardstown, and by Bishop David, who was consecrated 15 August 1819. Shortly after his ordination, Father Byrne was appointed pastor of St. Charles Church, replacing Father Charles Nerinckx, visiting also the small congregation of Louisville, sixty miles distant. In the spring of 1821 he and Father Elder opened St. Mary's College, near Bardstown, in an old abandoned distillery that stood on a farm purchased by Nerinckx. Empty barrels served as desks and small kegs as chairs.Riddle, Becky. \\"St. Mary's College\\", Kentucky Historical Society Byrne set tuition low and accepted produce in payment. He had about fifty boys to begin with, one of them being Martin John Spalding, later Archbishop of Baltimore. The settlement of St. Mary, Kentucky took its name from the college.University of Kentucky. Kentucky Atlas and Gazetteer. \\"Saint Mary, Kentucky\\" Father Byrne at first filled every office in the school and attended to his missionary duties as well. His college had become very popular in Kentucky when it was destroyed by fire. This set-back seemed only to give him new energy, and he soon had the college rebuilt. A second fire ruined a large part of the new structure, but nothing daunted, he went on and again placed the institution on a firm foundation. It is estimated that from 1821 to 1833, during the time St. Mary's College was under his immediate direction, at least twelve hundred students received instruction there, and carried the benefits of their education to all parts of Kentucky, some of them establishing private schools on their return to their respective neighborhoods.Webb, Ben J., The Centenary of Catholicity in Kentucky, Louisville. Charles A. Rogers, 1884, p. 284 Father Bryne, after twelve year's management of the college, made a gift of it to the Society of Jesus, believing that, having established its success, his old friends, the Jesuits, were better qualified than he was to conduct the school. He thought of funding a new school at Nashville, where one was much needed, and in spite of his advanced years he wrote to Bishop Flaget that all that he required in leaving St. Mary's to embark on this new enterprise was his horse and ten dollars to pay his traveling expenses. Before he could carry out the plan, however, a cholera epidemic had broken out in the neighborhood, and having gone to administer the last sacraments to a woman who lay dying of the disease, he became infected himself, and died the following day.\\"From Our History\\", Archdiocese of Louisville References 18th-century Irish people 19th-century Irish people 1780 births 1833 deaths Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Louisville Irish Roman Catholic missionaries Religious leaders from Kentucky Jesuit missionaries Irish emigrants to the United States (before 1923) Roman Catholic missionaries in the United States ","title":"William Byrne (Catholic)"},{"id":"12907295","text":"Pleuropetalum is a genus of flowering plants in the family Amaranthaceae.

He wrote a master's thesis on the point-contact transistor. In 1955, received a fellowship study with David Pines at Princeton University, working on many-body theory. He spent the summer of 1956 at Bell Labs, where he exchanged ideas with a variety of condensed matter theorists, including Philip W. Anderson and Walter Kohn He received his Ph.D. from the University of Paris in 1957 for the work he carried out at Princeton.  Academic career  In 1957 Nozi√®res was appointed the assistant director of the physics laboratory at the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure. In 1958 his academic career was interrupted when he was drafted by the French navy. He spent 2 years working on seismic detectors intended to sense atomic explosions. After leaving the navy in 1961, he became a professor at the University of Paris. He left Paris to join the Institut Laue-Langevin in Grenoble in 1972, and would continue to be associated with this institution for the rest of his career. In 1976 he became a professor at the University of Grenoble. In 1983 he became a professor at the Coll√®ge de France. Research  Nozi√®res‚Äô work has been concerned with various facets of the many-body problem. He made major contributions to understand the fundamental theory of solids, especially to the behavior of electrons in metals. In a short period, he has contributed profoundly to the concept of quasiparticles and its relation to Fermi liquids, to the dynamics of local systems in metals, to irreversible phenomena in quantum physics. Through his book (N-body problem) and his research, he has established a French school in solid state physics during the last 20 years whose influence extends all over the world. His work currently focuses on crystal growth and surface physics.  Awards  Nozi√®res has been recognized with a variety of awards for his seminal work. In 1988 he received the CNRS Gold medal. In 1984/85 he was awarded the Wolf Prize in Physics, along with Conyers Herring of Stanford University, for \\"their major contributions to the fundamental theory of solids, especially of the behaviour of electrons in metals\\". In 1974 he won the F. Holweck Prize. In 1961 he won the CNRS Silver Medal, and in 1960 the Prix Langevin from the Societe Francaise de Physique. In 1989 he became a Commandeur de l'Ordre National du M√©rite. He is a member of the French Academy of Sciences and a foreign associate of the US National Academy of Sciences.

Most modern computers that are documented as Harvard architecture are, in fact, modified Harvard architecture.  Harvard architecture  The original Harvard architecture computer, the Harvard Mark I, employed entirely separate memory systems to store instructions and data. The CPU fetched the next instruction and loaded or stored data simultaneously and independently. This is in contrast to a von Neumann architecture computer, in which both instructions and data are stored in the same memory system and (without the complexity of a CPU cache) must be accessed in turn. The physical separation of instruction and data memory is sometimes held to be the distinguishing feature of modern Harvard architecture computers. With microcontrollers (entire computer systems integrated onto single chips), the use of different memory technologies for instructions (e.g. flash memory) and data (typically read/write memory) in von Neumann machines is becoming popular. The true distinction of a Harvard machine is that instruction and data memory occupy different address spaces. In other words, a memory address does not uniquely identify a storage location (as it does in a von Neumann machine); it is also necessary to know the memory space (instruction or data) to which the address belongs.  Von Neumann architecture  A computer with a von Neumann architecture has the advantage over pure Harvard machines in that code can also be accessed and treated the same as data, and vice versa. This allows, for example, data to be read from disk storage into memory and then executed as code, or self-optimizing software systems using technologies such as just-in-time compilation to write machine code into their own memory and then later execute it. Another example is self-modifying code, which allows a program to modify itself. A disadvantage of these methods are issues with executable space protection, which increase the risks from malware and software defects. In addition, in these systems it is notoriously difficult to document code flow, and also can make debugging much more difficult.  Modified Harvard architecture  Accordingly, some pure Harvard machines are specialty products. Most modern computers instead implement a modified Harvard architecture. Those modifications are various ways to loosen the strict separation between code and data, while still supporting the higher performance concurrent data and instruction access of the Harvard architecture. =Split-cache (or almost-von- Neumann) architecture= The most common modification builds a memory hierarchy with separate CPU caches for instructions and data at lower levels of the hierarchy. There is a single address space for instructions and data, providing the von Neumann model, but the CPU fetches instructions from the instruction cache and fetches data from the data cache.Modified Harvard Architecture: Clarifying Confusion Most programmers never need to be aware of the fact that the processor core implements a (modified) Harvard architecture, although they benefit from its speed advantages. Only programmers who generate and store instructions into memory need to be aware of issues such as cache coherency, if the store doesn't modify or invalidate a cached copy of the instruction in an instruction cache. = Instruction-memory-as-data architecture = Another change preserves the \\"separate address space\\" nature of a Harvard machine, but provides special machine operations to access the contents of the instruction memory as data. Because data is not directly executable as instructions, such machines are not always viewed as \\"modified\\" Harvard architecture: * Read access: initial data values can be copied from the instruction memory into the data memory when the program starts. Or, if the data is not to be modified (it might be a constant value, such as pi, or a text string), it can be accessed by the running program directly from instruction memory without taking up space in data memory (which is often at a premium). * Write access: a capability for reprogramming is generally required; few computers are purely ROM-based. For example, a microcontroller usually has operations to write to the flash memory used to hold its instructions. This capability may be used for purposes including software updates. EEPROM/PROM replacement is an alternative method. = Data-memory-as- instruction architecture = A few Harvard architecture processors, such as the MAXQ, can execute instructions fetched from any memory segment - unlike the original Harvard processor, which can only execute instructions fetched from the program memory segment. Such processors, like other Harvard architecture processors - and unlike pure von Neumann architecture - can read an instruction and read a data value simultaneously, if they're in separate memory segments, since the processor has (at least) two separate memory segments with independent data buses. The most obvious programmer-visible difference between this kind of modified Harvard architecture and a pure von Neumann architecture is that - when executing an instruction from one memory segment - the same memory segment cannot be simultaneously accessed as data.MAXQ Family User's Guide. Sections 1.2 \\"Harvard Memory Architecture\\" and 2.5 \\"Pseudo-Von Neumann Memory Access\\".Konark Goel et al. About MAXQ GCC port.  Comparisons  Three characteristics may be used to distinguish modified Harvard machines from pure Harvard and von Neumann machines: ; Instruction and data memories occupy different address spaces For pure Harvard machines, there is an address \\"zero\\" in instruction space that refers to an instruction storage location and a separate address \\"zero\\" in data space that refers to a distinct data storage location. By contrast, von Neumann and split-cache modified Harvard machines store both instructions and data in a single address space, so address \\"zero\\" refers to only one location and whether the binary pattern in that location is interpreted as an instruction or data is defined by how the program is written. However, just like pure Harvard machines, instruction-memory-as-data modified Harvard machines have separate address spaces, so have separate addresses \\"zero\\" for instruction and data space, so this does not distinguish that type of modified Harvard machines from pure Harvard machines. ; Instruction and data memories have separate hardware pathways to the central processing unit (CPU) This is the point of pure or modified Harvard machines, and why they co-exist with the more flexible and general von Neumann architecture: separate memory pathways to the CPU allow instructions to be fetched and data to be accessed at the same time, improving throughput. The pure Harvard machines have separate pathways with separate address spaces. Split-cache modified Harvard machines have such separate access paths for CPU caches or other tightly coupled memories, but a unified access path covers the rest of the memory hierarchy. A von Neumann processor has only that unified access path. From a programmer's point of view, a modified Harvard processor in which instruction and data memories share an address space is usually treated as a von Neumann machine until cache coherency becomes an issue, as with self-modifying code and program loading. This can be confusing, but such issues are usually visible only to systems programmers and integrators. Other modified Harvard machines are like pure Harvard machines in this regard. ; Instruction and data memories may be accessed in different ways The original Harvard machine, the Mark I, stored instructions on a punched paper tape and data in electro-mechanical counters. This, however, was entirely due to the limitations of technology available at the time. Today a Harvard machine such as the PIC microcontroller might use 12-bit wide flash memory for instructions, and 8-bit wide SRAM for data. In contrast, a von Neumann microcontroller such as an ARM7TDMI, or a modified Harvard ARM9 core, necessarily provides uniform access to flash memory and SRAM (as 8 bit bytes, in those cases).  Modern uses of the modified Harvard architecture  Outside of applications where a cacheless DSP or microcontroller is required, most modern processors have a CPU cache which partitions instruction and data. There are also processors which are Harvard machines by the most rigorous definition (that program and data memory occupy different address spaces), and are only modified in the weak sense that there are operations to read and/or write program memory as data. For example, LPM (Load Program Memory) and SPM (Store Program Memory) instructions in the Atmel AVR implement such a modification. Similar solutions are found in other microcontrollers such as the PIC and Z8Encore!, many families of digital signal processors such as the TI C55x cores, and more. Because instruction execution is still restricted to the program address space, these processors are very unlike von Neumann machines. Having separate address spaces creates certain difficulties in programming with high-level languages that do not directly support the notion that tables of read-only data might be in a different address space from normal writable data (and thus need to be read using different instructions). The C programming language can support multiple address spaces either through non-standard extensions or through the now standardized extensions to support embedded processors.

It is endemic to Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador. It is threatened by habitat destruction. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed the conservation status of this tree as \\"vulnerable\\". Distribution and habitat Polylepis racemosa is endemic to high altitudes in the Andes of Peru, Bolivia and Ecuador. It is very typical of the flora of the western Andes in southern Peru where it grows at altitudes of up to . South of Lake Titicaca in Bolivia, it is restricted to the region around Araca. The region is known as the \\"Suni\\" meaning high and consists of long, narrow, steep-sided valleys and intervening undulating flatter areas. Ecology This species is fast growing, and is more ecological and adapts better than other species of the genus. It is a promising candidate for reforestation and agroforestry. This region is cold in the winter but has a dry climate; the herbage consists of various grasses and herbaceous plants, the wild potatoes Solanum acaule and Solanum bukasovii, and the woody shrubs P. racemosa, Mutisia acuminata, Baccharis sp., and Cantua buxifolia, which is the national flower of Peru. In Ecuador it has been introduced from Peru, and this may be detrimental because it hybridises readily with the local species of Polylepis, of which there are eight, including the endemic species Polylepis lanuginosa. The Polyepsis forest plays an important role in the ecosystem of the region, acting as a sponge to retain moisture. Uses The Aymara people, the indigenous people of this region, call the tree \\"que√±ua\\" and use the timber for fuel, for roofing their huts and for making charcoal. Status Polylepis racemosa has a somewhat restricted range and specific habitat requirements. It is under threat from reduction in its habitat as trees are cut and used for fuel and building materials. The area is also subject to burning, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed the conservation status of this tree as \\"vulnerable\\".

The film's music is by Anil Biswas and dialogue is by Wajahat Mirza. Mehboob Khan later remade this film as Mother India (1957), which is considered as one of the biggest hits of all time in Indian Cinema (and again repeated Wajahat Mirza for dialogues, Kanhiyalal as Sukhi Lala and Faredoon Irani for cinematography). The movie was reported to have the shades of Pearl S. Buck's The Good Earth.https://www.rediff.com/movies/2003/may/19copy.htm Plot Radha (Sardar Akhtar) is an indomitable woman, toiling away to feed her three sons and to pay off Sukhilala (Kanhaiyalal), the village's rapacious moneylender. When she learns that she is pregnant again, her husband, Shamu (Arun Kumar Ahuja), runs far away, leaving her to fend for herself against poverty and the lecherous advances of Sukhilala. Later, the two eldest children die, leaving her with only two sons: the strait-laced Ramu (Surendra) and the wild Birju (Yakub). The latter of the two becomes a bandit, who kills Sukhilala and kidnaps his childhood sweetheart. As a result, Radha and Ramu are cast out of the village. Eventually, Radha kills Birju for dishonoring her.
